Abstract

   This document proposes a number of changes to RFC 2026, the basic
   definition of the IETF standards process.  While some of them are
   definite changes to the rules, the intention is to preserve the main
   intent of the original rules, while adapting them to experience and
   current practice.

Internet-Draft              RFC 2026 Changes              September 2007


1.  Introduction

   BCP 9 [RFC2026] has been the basis for the IETF standards process for
   many years.  RFC 2026 has been in force since 1996, and has proved
   robust and adequately flexible for the main part.  However, some
   provisions have led to practical difficulties or lack clarity.  The
   changes proposed here are intended to tackle those issues.

   NOTE IN DRAFT: This version is a basis for discussion and debate, on
   the ietf@ietf.org list unless a specialized list is created.

   This document is organized as follows.  Firstly, there is an overview
   of the suggested changes.  Then, the proposed substantive changes are
   listed and explained in textual sequence, illustrated with extracts
   from RFC 2026.  Even single-word changes are listed if they are
   considered substantive.  Then, the mandatory sections of any RFC are
   included.  Finally, an Appendix lists purely editorial issues that
   will need to be handled in a new version of RFC 2026.


2.  Overview of Suggested Changes

   Where a suggestion needs some explanatory rationale, this is included
   among the detailed changes.
   o  Rationalize the way in which standards are referenced and
      numbered, by:
      1.  Assigning acronyms and numbers to standards at each stage of
          the standards track, not just at the final stage;
      2.  Clarifying in all indexes that more recent standards obsolete
          older ones regardless of their respective stages on the
          standards track;
      3.  Formally abolishing the now pointless "STD 1" RFCs.
   o  Tidy up terminology and explanatory text in the standards track
      definition.
      *  NOTE IN DRAFT: The proposals are based on the three stage
         standards track, and assume a goal of adjusting the rules to
         make it fully workable.  If the IETF chose to reduce to a two
         stage or one stage standards track, the proposals would be
         modified.
   o  Place responsibility for initiating the advancement or deprecation
      of stalled documents back in the community rather than expecting
      the IESG to do it.
   o  Formalize the reality that non-Working Group documents of any kind
      may be processed by the IETF and approved by the IESG.
   o  Clarify and simplify the description of Applicability Statements.
   o  Collate in one place the principles about normative references.

Internet-Draft              RFC 2026 Changes              September 2007


   o  Give the IESG explicit authority to define the granularity of
      interoperability testing.
   o  Simplify the variance process.
   o  Clarify that the appeals process applies to all decisions.

   Additionally, there are several proposals for smaller changes that
   are intended only for clarification and alignment with reality.


3.  Detailed Proposals for Change

   Extracts from RFC 2026 are presented verbatim in quotation marks,
   preceded and followed by these markers:
   "---------Begin Extract---------
   -----------End Extract---------"
   Proposed changes are presented as plain text.

   "---------Begin Extract---------


   The Internet Standards Process described in this document is
   concerned with all protocols, procedures, and conventions that are
   used in or by the Internet, whether or not they are part of the
   TCP/IP protocol suite.  In the case of protocols developed and/or
   standardized by non-Internet organizations, however, the Internet
   Standards Process normally applies to the application of the protocol
   or procedure in the Internet context, not to the specification of the
   protocol itself.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Replace the last sentence by:

   In the case of protocols developed and/or standardized outside the
   IETF, the Internet Standards Process may be applied to the use of the
   protocol in the Internet context.  Similarly, IETF protocols may be
   cited in specifications developed elsewhere.  The IETF will not
   normally modify protocols developed elsewhere, and does not normally
   permit its protocols to be modified elsewhere.

   RATIONALE: The previous text did not allow for the complexity of
   interaction between IETF and non-IETF protocols, nor set the proper
   context for liaison relationships.

   2.1  Requests for Comments (RFCs)
   ...
      The status of Internet protocol and service specifications is
      summarized periodically in an RFC entitled "Internet Official
      Protocol Standards" [1].  This RFC shows the level of maturity and
      other helpful information for each Internet protocol or service
      specification (see section 3).

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Delete this paragraph and all other references to
   STD1.

   RATIONALE: This was written before a hyperlinked index was available
   on line.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

      Some RFCs document Internet Standards.  These RFCs form the 'STD'
      subseries of the RFC series [4].  When a specification has been
      adopted as an Internet Standard, it is given the additional label
      "STDxxx", but it keeps its RFC number and its place in the RFC
      series. (see section 4.1.3)

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Replace the last sentence by:

   When a specification has been approved for publication on the
   standards track, it is assigned a Standard Number (e.g. 10) and a
   Standard Acronym (e.g.  SMTP), independent of its RFC number and its
   place in the RFC series.

   Acronyms may comprise sub-acronyms (e.g.  SMTP/Submission) in the
   case of multipart standards.

   RATIONALE: The fact that only full Standards receive an STD number,
   and possibly an acronym, is today a major source of confusion to
   users of the standards, since these numbers and acronyms are not
   associatd with PS and DS documents.  Users do not, in fact, know
   where to look for the latest standard, since a DS may obsolete an
   STD, and a PS may obsolete either.  It would be much less confusing
   if a new or existing acronym was assigned as part of the initial
   standards action (thus RFC 2821 would have been associated with
   SMTP).  Similarly, the STD number should be assigned at PS stage for
   simpler tracking - thus RFC 2821 would also be known as PS10, for
   example.  (Also see comments on section 4.1.3.)

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   ...
   Not all specifications of protocols or services for the Internet
   should or will become Internet Standards or BCPs.  Such non-standards
   track specifications are not subject to the rules for Internet
   standardization.  Non-standards track specifications may be published
   directly as "Experimental" or "Informational" RFCs at the discretion
   of the RFC Editor in consultation with the IESG (see section 4.2).

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Replace this paragraph by:

   Not all specifications of protocols or services for the Internet
   should or will become Internet Standards or BCPs.  When such non-
   standards track specifications are produced within the IETF, they are
   subject to the rules of the IETF except those that concern only the
   standards track and BCPs.  Non-standards track IETF specifications
   may be published as "Experimental" or "Informational" RFCs if
   approved by the IESG.  Note that additional paths to publication are
   possible [RFC4844], [RFC4846].

   RATIONALE: IETF Experimental or Informational RFCs are distinct from
   independent submissions to the RFC Editor, which are now processed
   under [RFC3932], and from IAB and IRTF documents.  Also, we want all
   IETF documents to be subject to many of our rules, such as the IPR
   rules and the appeals process.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

  2.2  Internet-Drafts

     During the development of a specification, draft versions of the
     document are made available for informal review and comment by
     placing them in the IETF's "Internet-Drafts" directory, which is
     replicated on a number of Internet hosts.  This makes an evolving
     working document readily available to a wide audience, facilitating
     the process of review and revision.

     An Internet-Draft that is published as an RFC, or that has remained
     unchanged in the Internet-Drafts directory for more than six months
     without being recommended by the IESG for publication as an RFC, is
     simply removed from the Internet-Drafts directory.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Replace 'recommended' by 'considered'.

Internet-Draft              RFC 2026 Changes              September 2007


   RATIONALE: Expiry is inhibited when a draft enters IESG
   consideration, not when it is approved.

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Add the following two paragraphs:

   Drafts are also removed from the directory after publication as an
   RFC.  However, all versions of all drafts are retained in the IETF
   archive for legal reasons and may be subject to subpoena.  Authors
   should be aware that expired drafts are unofficially available in
   many places.  Authors may request expired drafts to be removed from
   such availability, but this is outside the control of the IETF.

   The published RFC will not be textually identical to the final
   version of the draft.  Not only will the required boilerplate text be
   finalized; the RFC Editor will also make editorial corrections, and
   any minor technical changes following IESG review will be applied.

   RATIONALE: Aligning with reality.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

 3.1  Technical Specification (TS)

    A Technical Specification is any description of a protocol, service,
    procedure, convention, or format.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Add the following paragraph:

   Thus a TS is not limited to defining a wire protocol; it may for
   example define an Application Programming Interface (i.e. a
   convention) or a data definition such as a MIB or an IANA registry
   (i.e. a format).  However, a TS must be both implementable and
   testable.

   RATIONALE: Although clearly within the intended scope of RFC 2026,
   these types of TS have been a source of debate and deserve
   clarification.  Also see later comments on implementation reports.

...
   A TS shall include a statement of its scope and the general intent
   for its use (domain of applicability).  Thus, a TS that is inherently
   specific to a particular context shall contain a statement to that
   effect.  However, a TS does not specify requirements for its use
   within the Internet;  these requirements, which depend on the
   particular context in which the TS is incorporated by different
   system configurations, are defined by an Applicability Statement.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Delete the 3rd sentence.

   RATIONALE: The last sentence very unclear.  Is it saying that a TS
   doesn't contain operational guidelines?  Quite often, the Operations
   Area comments on a draft TS are, in effect, asking for operational
   guidelines.  If a TS refers to a timeout or some other behavioural
   parameter, Operations people may insist on specifying a default value
   and guidance about when to change the default.  But the above
   sentence could suggest that this belongs in a separate AS.  In
   practice, few authors separate such things from the basic
   specification.  The simplest resolution is to drop the whole
   sentence.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

3.2  Applicability Statement (AS)

   An Applicability Statement specifies how, and under what
   circumstances, one or more TSs may be applied to support a particular
   Internet capability.  An AS may specify uses for TSs that are not
   Internet Standards, as discussed in Section 7.

   An AS identifies the relevant TSs and the specific way in which they
   are to be combined, and may also specify particular values or ranges
   of TS parameters or subfunctions of a TS protocol that must be
   implemented.  An AS also specifies the circumstances in which the use
   of a particular TS is required, recommended, or elective (see section
   3.3).

   An AS may describe particular methods of using a TS in a restricted
   "domain of applicability", such as Internet routers, terminal
   servers, Internet systems that interface to Ethernets, or datagram-
   based database servers.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Delete these three paragraphs.

Internet-Draft              RFC 2026 Changes              September 2007


   RATIONALE: The community really doesn't have the habit of writing
   this sort of separate AS; it's rare, and very rare in WG charters.
   In fact, an AS of this style, covering a set of related TS documents
   of various maturities, would be very similar to the type of Internet
   Standards description document that was discussed by the newtrk WG.
   It doesn't really fit anywhere in today's document taxonomy - it has
   more significance than an Informational document, but doesn't belong
   on the standards track because it can't be implemented and tested in
   itself.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

    The broadest type of AS is a comprehensive conformance specification,
    commonly called a "requirements document", for a particular class of
    Internet systems, such as Internet routers or Internet hosts.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Delete this paragraph.

   RATIONALE: Firstly, this is not the community's normal understanding
   of a conformance specification, which generally refers to product
   certification.  Secondly, in the IETF today, we use the word
   "requirements" much more broadly, often for a front-end Informational
   document when a WG is starting out.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   An AS may not have a higher maturity level in the standards track
   than any standards-track TS on which the AS relies (see section 4.1).
   For example, a TS at Draft Standard level may be referenced by an AS
   at the Proposed Standard or Draft Standard level, but not by an AS at
   the Standard level.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Move this paragraph to a new general section on
   normative reference requirements, and rewrite as:

   A standards-track document should not have a higher maturity level in
   the standards track than any standards-track document on which it
   relies normatively.

   RATIONALE: There is nothing specific to ASes in this rule; it is
   applied globally wherever normative references occur.  See comment
   below on 4.2.4.

   3.3  Requirement Levels

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: The text should be reorganized to give this material
   general scope for all standards-track and BCP documents.

   RATIONALE: There is nothing specific to AS vs TS vs BCP in these
   requirement levels.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

...
   The "Official Protocol Standards" RFC (STD1) lists a general
   requirement level for each TS, using the nomenclature defined in this
   section. This RFC is updated periodically.  In many cases, more
   detailed descriptions of the requirement levels of particular
   protocols and of individual features of the protocols will be found
   in appropriate ASs.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Replace the first two sentences by:

   The RFC Editor web site displays current maturity and requirement
   levels for each standards track and BCP document.

   RATIONALE: Aligning with reality.

   4.  THE INTERNET STANDARDS TRACK

   -----------End Extract---------"

   NOTE IN DRAFT: The following comments are based on the three stage
   standards track, and assume a goal of adjusting the rules to make it
   fully workable.  If the IETF chose to reduce to a two stage or one
   stage standards track, this would simplify things further and
   appropriate editorial cuts and changes could be made.

  4.1.1  Proposed Standard
  ...
     Implementors should treat Proposed Standards as immature
     specifications.  It is desirable to implement them in order to gain
     experience and to validate, test, and clarify the specification.
     However, since the content of Proposed Standards may be changed if
     problems are found or better solutions are identified, deploying
     implementations of such standards into a disruption-sensitive
     environment is not recommended.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGES:

   1.  Rename PS as Preliminary Standard.

   2.  Add text on the following lines:

   Preliminary Standard is indeed the preliminary level.  Implementors
   should be aware that a PS may be revised or even withdrawn.  However,
   it is nevertheless common to use PS implementations operationally.
   Many documents spend their entire active life as PS.  Certain types
   of specification, e.g. data formats such as MIBs, are likely to be
   recycled at PS as they evolve rather than being promoted.  This may
   be a result of complexity, or due to intrinsic difficulties in
   interoperability testing and normative dependencies.

   RATIONALE: It is well known that to a large extent the warnings about
   PS have been ignored, and that the Internet "runs on Proposed
   Standards."  Also, as the MIB doctors have observed, some types of
   spec may benefit from being recycled at this level rather than being
   "promoted."  The name change makes the status more immediately
   obvious.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   4.1.2  Draft Standard

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Rename as Interoperable Standard (IS).

   RATIONALE: Just as "proposed" standard is effectively interpreted as
   "preliminary", "draft standard" is effectively interpreted as
   "definitive".  Also we have the problem of confusion with "Internet-
   Draft."  A name change would reduce this risk of confusion and
   clarify the factual status.

Internet-Draft              RFC 2026 Changes              September 2007


   "---------Begin Extract---------

    A specification from which at least two independent and interoperable
    implementations from different code bases have been developed, and
    for which sufficient successful operational experience has been
    obtained, may be elevated to the "Draft Standard" level.  For the
    purposes of this section, "interoperable" means to be functionally
    equivalent or interchangeable components of the system or process in
    which they are used.  If patented or otherwise controlled technology
    is required for implementation, the separate implementations must
    also have resulted from separate exercise of the licensing process.
    Elevation to Draft Standard is a major advance in status, indicating
    a strong belief that the specification is mature and will be useful.

    The requirement for at least two independent and interoperable
    implementations applies to all of the options and features of the
    specification.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Add the following paragraph:

   The IESG is empowered (subject to community consensus) to define the
   level of granularity required in interpreting this requirement, and
   how to demonstrate interoperability for specifications that do not
   define wire protocols or have a single-ended nature.

   RATIONALE: At least the four significant questions below arise
   repeatedly in interpreting this rule.  It seems best to leave this to
   the IESG and its assessment of community consensus, rather than to
   set rigid rules.
   1.  What is a "feature"?  This can be interpreted in many ways.  For
       a TLV field is every separate type code a feature?  Is every use
       of a normative keyword [RFC2119] a feature?
   2.  Is it acceptable if features A and B are shown to be
       interoperable between implementations X and Y, and features C and
       D are shown to be interoperable between implentations P and Q?
       In that case we have shown interoperability of features A, B, C
       and D but have not shown that any implementation successfully
       interoperates with all of them.

       Since the goal is to use running code to verify that the
       specification in question enables interoperability, not to test
       whether the implementations comply, the answer appears to be yes.
       (For the strong security requirement of BCP 61 [RFC3365], the
       Security Area, with the support of the IESG, has often insisted
       that specifications include at least one mandatory-to-implement
       strong security mechanism, in the interests of universal secure

Internet-Draft              RFC 2026 Changes              September 2007


       interoperability.  However, since the goal of the rule is to test
       the specification, not the implementations, a mandatory-to-
       implement requirement does not change the argument, even if some
       implementations ignore it.)
   3.  Is it acceptable if both implementations X and Y show
       interoperability with implementation Q, but the implementor of Q
       is not party to the tests and does not make any statements about
       features supported?  In other words Q has merely served as an
       active mirror in the tests.
   4.  How should we handle the issue of "single-ended" technical
       specifications such as data formats, where there is no new
       protocol whose interoperation we can verify?  A practical
       solution for MIBs has been documented [RFC2438] and some
       generalisation of this seems to be needed.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

   In cases in which one or more options or features
   have not been demonstrated in at least two interoperable
   implementations, the specification may advance to the Draft Standard
   level only if those options or features are removed.

   The Working Group chair is responsible for documenting the specific
   implementations which qualify the specification for Draft or Internet
   Standard status along with documentation about testing of the
   interoperation of these implementations.  The documentation must
   include information about the support of each of the individual
   options and features.  This documentation should be submitted to the
   Area Director with the protocol action request. (see Section 6)

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Add this sentence:

   The IESG is empowered (subject to community consensus) to define the

4.2.2  Informational

   An "Informational" specification is published for the general

   designation is intended to provide for the timely publication of a
   very broad range of responsible informational documents from many
   sources, subject only to editorial considerations and to verification
   that there has been adequate coordination with the standards process
   (see section 4.2.3).

    publication for comments before proceeding further.  The RFC Editor
    is expected to exercise his or her judgment concerning the editorial
    suitability of a document for publication with Experimental or
    Informational status, and may refuse to publish a document which, in

4.2.4  Historic

   A specification that has been superseded by a more recent
   specification or is for any other reason considered to be obsolete is
   assigned to the "Historic" level.  (Purists have suggested that the
   word should be "Historical"; however, at this point the use of
   "Historic" is historical.)

   Note: Standards track specifications normally must not depend on
   other standards track specifications which are at a lower maturity
   level or on non standards track specifications other than referenced
   specifications from other standards bodies.  (See Section 7.)

   -----------End Extract---------"

   EDITOR'S NOTE: The first paragraph has not been implemented
   consistently.  In most cases a standards track RFC that has been
   obsoleted by a more recent version is not listed in the RFC Index as
   Historic, leading to user confusion about the correct version to use.

   It is suggested that the IESG takes action to correct this situation.

   PROPOSED CHANGE: move the second paragraph to the new section
   proposed in the comments on section 3.2.  Also add there:

   Standards track and BCP documents must, and other documents should,
   distinguish between normative and informative references.  Normative
   references are those that are required reading to correctly
   understand and implement a specification.  Procedures exist to allow
   normative references to less mature documents [RFC3967], [RFC4897].

   RATIONALE: we need to clarify and collate the rules about normative
   references.

   EDITOR's NOTE: Down-references are a cause of publication delays.  We
   could simplify matters further with a new policy that simply says:
   Documents on the standards track, or BCPs, may refer normatively to
   any document on the standards track or to any BCP, as long as down-
   level references are labelled as such in the list of references.
   (Since we refer to RFCs, which are never changed after publication,
   this change of rule would remain robust against features being
   removed or changed after the citing document is published.  However,
   the change here compared to [RFC4897] is only that the down-ref need
   not be mentioned during Last Call.)

5.  BEST CURRENT PRACTICE (BCP) RFCs

   ...
   While it is recognized that entities such as the IAB and IESG are
   composed of individuals who may participate, as individuals, in the
   technical work of the IETF, it is also recognized that the entities
   themselves have an existence as leaders in the community.  As leaders
   in the Internet technical community, these entities should have an
   outlet to propose ideas to stimulate work in a particular area, to
   raise the community's sensitivity to a certain issue, to make a
   statement of architectural principle, or to communicate their
   thoughts on other matters.  The BCP subseries creates a smoothly
   structured way for these management entities to insert proposals into
   the consensus-building machinery of the IETF while gauging the
   community's view of that issue.

   A specification that is intended to enter or advance in the Internet

   It shall remain as an Internet-Draft for a period of time, not less
   than two weeks, that permits useful community review, after which a
   recommendation for action may be initiated.

   A standards action is initiated by a recommendation by the IETF
   Working group responsible for a specification to its Area Director,
   copied to the IETF Secretariat or, in the case of a specification not
   associated with a Working Group, a recommendation by an individual to

6.2  Advancing in the Standards Track
...
   Change of status shall result in republication of the specification
   as an RFC, except in the rare case that there have been no changes at
   all in the specification since the last publication.  Generally,
   desired changes will be "batched" for incorporation at the next level
   in the standards track.  However, deferral of changes to the next
   standards action on the specification will not always be possible or
   desirable; for example, an important typographical error, or a
   technical error that does not represent a change in overall function
   of the specification, may need to be corrected immediately.  In such
   cases, the IESG or RFC Editor may be asked to republish the RFC (with
   a new number) with corrections, and this will not reset the minimum
   time-at-level clock.

6.2  Advancing in the Standards Track
...
   When a standards-track specification has not reached the Internet
   Standard level but has remained at the same maturity level for
   twenty-four (24) months, and every twelve (12) months thereafter
   until the status is changed, the IESG shall review the viability of
   the standardization effort responsible for that specification and the
   usefulness of the technology. Following each such review, the IESG
   shall approve termination or continuation of the development effort,
   at the same time the IESG shall decide to maintain the specification
   at the same maturity level or to move it to Historic status.  This
   decision shall be communicated to the IETF by electronic mail to the
   IETF Announce mailing list to allow the Internet community an
   opportunity to comment. This provision is not intended to threaten a
   legitimate and active Working Group effort, but rather to provide an
   administrative mechanism for terminating a moribund effort.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Replace this by:

   In normal practice, the IESG may be requested to advance any
   standards-track specification that has been long enough in grade, or
   to replace or deprecate any IETF document, by the relevant Working
   Group if it exists, or by any individual participant(s) if not.

   Additionally, when a standards-track specification has not reached
   the highest level, but has remained at the same maturity level for at
   least the required minimum period plus one year, any member(s) of the
   community may request the IESG to review the viability of the
   standardization effort responsible for that specification and the
   usefulness of the technology.  Such a request should include a
   proposed action, with a justification and suitable Internet-Drafts if
   appropriate.  Following each such request, the IESG shall approve
   termination or continuation of the development effort.  At the same
   time the IESG shall decide whether to maintain the specification at
   the same maturity level or to move it to Historic status.  This
   decision shall be communicated to the IETF by electronic mail to the
   IETF Announce mailing list to allow the Internet community an
   opportunity to comment.  This provision is not intended to threaten a
   legitimate and active Working Group effort, but rather to provide an
   administrative mechanism for reviving or terminating a moribund
   effort, and for marking obsolete specifications as such.

   RATIONALE: This shifts the responsibility to initiate advancement or
   deprecation of specifications to the community.  No IESG has ever had
   the cycles to initiate such actions, and it is much better practice
   to delegate this responsibility.  It also clarifies the difference

   PROPOSED CHANGE: Move this up to a top-level section, with any small
   updates to clarify that all WG and IESG decisions may be appealed.

   RATIONALE: It's possible to read the current sub-section as applying
   only to IESG actions described in this section 6.  The IESG and IAB
   have preferred to read it as applying to any decision whatever.

   EDITOR's NOTE: Another approach would be to split this off as a

   mechanism to deal with over-enthusiastic use of the appeal mechanism

   Alternatively, the proposed variance may be included in the document
   concerned, in a separate section named "Process Variance".  The
   extended Last-Call requirement will still apply.

    the standardization of protocols and procedures.  It defines the
    stages in the standardization process, the requirements for moving a
    document between stages and the types of documents used during this
    process.  It also addresses the intellectual property rights and
    copyright issues associated with the standards process.

   1.1  Internet Standards

      The Internet, a loosely-organized international collaboration of
      autonomous, interconnected networks, supports host-to-host
      communication through voluntary adherence to open protocols and
      procedures defined by Internet Standards.  There are also many
      isolated interconnected networks, which are not connected to the
      global Internet but use the Internet Standards.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   "Host-to-host" is strictly accurate, but today we tend to emphasise
   the need for "end-to-end" communication.  Also, our experience is
   that isolated networks tend to get connected sooner or later.
   However, these are subtle questions and it is proposed to remove the
   architectural summary from this process document.

2.1  Requests for Comments (RFCs)

   Each distinct version of an Internet standards-related specification
   is published as part of the "Request for Comments" (RFC) document
   series.  This archival series is the official publication channel for
   Internet standards documents and other publications of the IESG, IAB,
   and Internet community.  RFCs can be obtained from a number of
   Internet hosts using anonymous FTP, gopher, World Wide Web, and other
   Internet document-retrieval systems.

   The RFC series of documents on networking began in 1969 as part of
   the original ARPA wide-area networking (ARPANET) project (see
   Appendix A for glossary of acronyms).  RFCs cover a wide range of
   topics in addition to Internet Standards, from early discussion of
   new research concepts to status memos about the Internet.  RFC
   publication is the direct responsibility of the RFC Editor, under the
   general direction of the IAB.

   (c)  Elective:  Implementation of the referenced TS is optional
      within the domain of applicability of the AS;  that is, the AS
      creates no explicit necessity to apply the TS.  However, a
      particular vendor may decide to implement it, or a particular user
      may decide that it is a necessity in a specific environment.  For
      example, the DECNET MIB could be seen as valuable in an
      environment where the DECNET protocol is used.

   Update the example.

      Although TSs and ASs are conceptually separate, in practice a
      standards-track document may combine an AS and one or more related
      TSs.

   It would be much clearer to the reader if this was said at the

   6.1.3  Publication

      If a standards action is approved, notification is sent to the RFC
      Editor and copied to the IETF with instructions to publish the
      specification as an RFC.  The specification shall at that point be
      removed from the Internet-Drafts directory.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   "At that point" refers to the moment of publication of the RFC.

   "---------Begin Extract---------

6.2  Advancing in the Standards Track
...
   Change of status shall result in republication of the specification
   as an RFC, except in the rare case that there have been no changes at
   all in the specification since the last publication.  Generally,
   desired changes will be "batched" for incorporation at the next level
   in the standards track.  However, deferral of changes to the next
   standards action on the specification will not always be possible or
   desirable; for example, an important typographical error, or a
   technical error that does not represent a change in overall function
   of the specification, may need to be corrected immediately.  In such
   cases, the IESG or RFC Editor may be asked to republish the RFC (with
   a new number) with corrections, and this will not reset the minimum
   time-at-level clock.

   -----------End Extract---------"

   Add a note that the RFC Editor maintains errata for published RFCs.

 7.1  Use of External Specifications

    To avoid conflict between competing versions of a specification, the
    Internet community will not standardize a specification that is
    simply an "Internet version" of an existing external specification
