   diverting information in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling.
   This document proposes a way to map call forwarding information
   contained in a Diversion header into a History-Info header and vice
   versa.  In addition, an interworking policy is proposed to manage the
   headers coexistence.
   Prior to existence of [RFC4244] describing the History-Info header,
   there was a draft introducing a header named Diversion for the
   transport of diversion information.
   Since the Diversion header is used in many existing networks
   implementations and it is not standardized for transport of diversion
   information, a mapping with the standardized History-Info header is
   needed.

Internet-Draft     Mapping Diversion and History-Info          July 2008


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   For enhanced network services (eg.  Voicemail, IVR or automatic call
   distribution), it is necessary for the called SIP user agent to
   identify from whom and why the session was diverted.  In order to be
   used by various service providers or applications, redirection
   information needs to pass through the network.
   This is possible with two different SIP headers: History-Info
   [RFC4244] and Diversion [draft-levy-sip-diversion-08] which both able
   to transport diversion information in SIP signaling.  Because of this
   double possibility, it is necessary to map one into the other.
   This document provides a standard mechanism of translation between
   the History-Info header and the Diversion header.

1.2.  Background

   To transport diversion information, the History-Info header [RFC4244]
   and an URI extension [RFC4458] are advocated in the standardized
   Communication Diversion (CDIV) service Protocol Specifications
   [TS_183004] and [TS_24.604].
   Because of the implementation of the Diversion header in some SIP
   networks/terminals and the History-Info header in others, it is
   necessary to map one to the other.

   At first, the Diversion header was described in
   [draft-levy-sip-diversion-08], which is today discarded.  This header
   contains the list of the diverting user(s) with associated
   information.  The top-most diversion entry (first in the list)
   corresponds to the last diverting user and the bottom-most entry to
   the first diverting user (see syntax below).

   At the same time, the History-Info header was proposed for the
   transport of "request history" information which allows the receiving
   application to determine hints about how and why the session arrived
   at the application/user.  As history information is larger than
   diversion information, diversion information MUST be located and
   extracted from the History-Info header.  This is not the case with
   the Diversion header.  In addition, for diverting information the
   History-Info header MUST be completed by [RFC4458] for the transport
   of the diversion reason.

   Those headers have different syntaxes described below.  Note that the
   main difference is that the History-Info header is a chronological
   writing header whereas the Diversion header is the opposite (i.e. the
   first diversion entry read correspond to the last diverting user).

Internet-Draft     Mapping Diversion and History-Info          July 2008


2.  Problem Statement

2.1.  Interworking need

   The Diversion header is used for recording communication diversion
   information which could be useful to network entities downstream.
   Today, this SIP header is implemented by several manufacturers and
   deployed in several networks.

   In addition, the History-Info header is standardized, among other
   needs, for the transportation of diversion information.

   As both are answering to call forwarding needs, according to the one
   created or completed in one side and the one interpreted in the other
   side, diverting information could be mixed-up if they are both
   present in the INVITE request.  So, Diversion and History-Info
   headers MUST NOT independently coexist for the session signalling.

   For the transportation of consistent diversion information
   downstream, it is necessary to make the two headers interwork.
   Mapping between the Diversion header and the History-Info header is
   presented in sections 5 and 6.

2.2.  Interworking recommendations

   To avoid the two headers coexisting it would be better to replace one
   by the other during the interworking, but this may not be possible
   due to the information that History-Info header may carry.
   Indeed, the History-Info header is larger than Diversion header and
   is used for other services than call diversion: in addition to trace
   call forwarding information, it is acting as a session history and
   could store all successive R-URI values.  So, sometimes, it will not
   be possible to suppress the History-Info header after the Diversion
   header has been created.

   SIP network/terminal using Diversion to SIP network/terminal using
   History-Info header:

   When the Diversion header is mapped into a History-Info header, the
   Diversion header MUST be suppressed in the outgoing INVITE.  It is
   considered that all information present in the Diversion header is
   transferred in the History-Info header.

   If a History-Info header is present in the incoming INVITE (in
   addition to Diversion header), the Diversion header and History-Info
   header present MUST be mixed and only the diversion information not
   yet present in the History-Info header MUST be inserted as a last
   entry (more recent) in the existing History-Info header as

Internet-Draft     Mapping Diversion and History-Info          July 2008


   recommended in [RFC4244].
   As an example, this could be the case of an INVITE coming from a
   network_2 using Diversion header but before passed through a
   network_1 using History-Info header (or the network_2 uses History-
   Info header to transport successive URI information) and going to a
   network_3 using History-Info header.  In that case, the incoming
   INVITE contains a Diversion header and a History-info header.  So
   that, it is necessary to create, for network_3, a single History-Info
   header gathering existing information in the History-Info header
   received and those present in the Diversion header.  Then network_3
   could use call forwarding information that are present in a single
   header and add its own diversion information if necessary.

   Note that the chronological order could not be certified.  If
   previous policy recommendations are applied, the chronological order
   is respected as Diversion entries are inserted at the end of the
   History-Info header taking into account the Diversion internal
   chronology.

   SIP network/terminal using History-Info header to SIP network/
   terminal using Diversion header:

   When the History-Info header is mapped into a Diversion header, some
   precautions MUST be taken.
   If the History-Info header contains only communication diversion
   information, then it MUST be suppressed after the mapping.
   If the History-Info header contains other information, then only the
   information of concern to the diverting user MUST be used to create
   entries in the Diversion header and the History-Info header MUST be
   kept as received in the INVITE forwarded downstream.

   Note: The History-Info header could be used for other reasons than
   CDIV services, for example by a service which need to know if a
   specific AS had yet been invoked in the signalling path.  If the call
   is after forwarded to a network using History-Info header, it would
   be better to not loose history information due to passing though the
   network which only support Diversion header.  A recommended solution
   MUST NOT disrupt the standard behaviour and networks which not
   implement History-Info header MUST be transparent to an incoming
   History-Info header.

   If a Diversion header is already presents in the incoming INVITE (in
   addition to History-Info header), only diversion information present
   in the History-Info header but not in the Diversion header MUST be
   inserted from the last entry (more recent) into the existing
   Diversion header as recommended in the Diversion draft
   [draft-levy-sip-diversion-08].  Note that the chronological order
   could not be certified.  If previous policy recommendations are

Internet-Draft     Mapping Diversion and History-Info          July 2008


   respected, this case SHOULD NOT happen.


   Forking case:
   The History-Info header enables the recording of sequential forking
   for the same served-user.  During a mapping from the History-Info
   header to Diversion header, the History-Info entries contaning a
   forking situation (with an incremented "index" parameter) could be
   either mapped for each entry with a call forwarding "cause"
   parameter, the interworking entity could choose to create only one
   Diversion entry or to not apply the mapping.  The choice could be
   done according a local policy.


3.  Headers syntaxes reminder

3.1.  History-Info header syntax

   History-Info = "History-Info" HCOLON hi-entry *(COMMA hi-entry)
   hi-entry = hi-targeted-to-uri *( SEMI hi-param )
   hi-targeted-to-uri= name-addr
   hi-param = hi-index / hi-extension
   hi-index = "index" EQUAL 1*DIGIT *(DOT 1*DIGIT)
   hi-extension = generic-param


   The History-Info header is specified in [RFC4244].  Amongst the
   information contained in the header list is the diversion information
   with a specific cause code mentioning the diversion reason.  These
   optional cause codes are defined in [RFC4458].  It is also possible
   to introduce the Privacy header defined in [RFC3323] for diversion
   information.  The top-most History-Info entry (first in the list)
   corresponds to the oldest history information.
   A diverting user information is identifiable by the History-Info
   entry containing a cause-param with cause value as listed in
   [RFC4458] and by the entry just before.  The last diversion target is
   identifiable by the last History-Info entries containing a cause-
   param with cause value as listed in RFC 4458.
   The cause-param is inserted in the hi-targeted-to-uri of the address
   were the communication is diverted to.  The index parameter is a
   string of digits, separated by dots to indicate the number of forward
   hops and retargets.


   Example:

   History-Info:
   <sip: diverting_user1_addr; Privacy=none >;index=1,

Internet-Draft     Mapping Diversion and History-Info          July 2008


   <sip: diverting_user2_addr; Privacy=history;
   Reason=SIP;cause=302>index=1.1,
   <sip:last_diversion_target;Reason=SIP;cause=486>; index=1.1.1,


   Policy concerning "histinfo" option tag in Supported header:
   According to [RFC4244], a proxy that receives a Request with the
   "histinfo" option tag in the Supported header should return captured
   History-Info in subsequent, provisional and final responses to the
   Request.  The behaviour depend whether the local policy support the
   capture of History-Info or not.



3.2.  Diversion header syntax

   It seems that there is some few mistakes in the Diversion syntax, so
   it would be better to use the following syntax:

   Diversion = "Diversion" HCOLON diversion-params *(COMMA diversion-
   params)
   diversion-params = name-addr *(SEMI (diversion-reason / diversion-
   counter / diversion-limit / diversion-privacy / diversion-screen /
   diversion-extension))
   diversion-reason = "reason" EQUAL ("unknown" / "user-busy" / "no-
   answer" / "unavailable" / "unconditional" / "time-of-day" / "do-not-
   disturb" / "deflection" / "follow-me" / "out-of-service" / "away" /
   token / quoted-string)
   diversion-counter = "counter" EQUAL 1*2DIGIT
   diversion-limit = "limit" EQUAL 1*2DIGIT
   diversion-privacy = "privacy" EQUAL ("full" / "name" / "uri" / "off"
   / token / quoted-string)
   diversion-screen = "screen" EQUAL ("yes" / "no" / token / quoted-
   string)
   diversion-extension = token [EQUAL (token / quoted-string)]


   Note: The Diversion header could be used in the comma-separated
   format as described below and in a header-separated format.  Both
   formats could be combined a received INVITE as RECOMMENDED in
   [RFC3261].


   Example:

   Diversion:
   diverting_user2_addr; reason="user-busy"; counter=1; privacy=full,
   diverting_user1_addr; reason="unconditional"; counter=1; privacy=off

4.  Headers in SIP METHOD

   You can find here a reminder of History-Info header field and
   Diversion header field in relation to methods.  As those headers does
   not have the same capabilities, it is necessary to clarify the
   interworking.
   Use of History-Info header field:

   Header field where proxy ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG MSG
   ------------ ----- ----- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
   History-Info        amdr   -   -   -  o   o   o   o
                            SUB NOT REF INF UPD PRA PUB
                            --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
   History-Info        amdr o    o   o   -   -   -   o


   Use of Diversion header field:

   Header field where  enc. e-e ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG
   ------------ ----- ----- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
   Diversion      R          h   -   -   -   o   -   -
   Diversion     3xx         h   -   -   -   o   -   -

   The recommended interworking presented in this document SHOULD apply
   only for INVITE requests.

   In 3xx responses, both headers could be present.
   When a proxy wants to interwork with a network supporting the other
   header field, it SHOULD apply the mapping between Diversion header
   and History-Info header in the 3xx response.
   When a recursing proxy redirects an initial INVITE after receving a
   3xx response, it SHOULD add as a last entry either a Diversion header
   or History-Info header (according its capabilities) in the forwarded
   INVITE.  Local policies could apply to send the received header in
   the next INVITE or not.

   Other messages where History-Info could be present are not used for
   the Call Forwarding service and SHOULD NOT be changed into Diversion
   header.  The destination network MUST be transparent the received
   History-Info header.


5.  Diversion header to History-Info header

   For N Diversion entries N+1 History-Info entries MUST be created.  To
   create the History-Info entries in the same order than during a
   session establishment, the Diversion entries MUST be mapped from the
   bottom-most until the top-most.

   The first entry created in the History-Info header contains:

      - a hi-target-to-uri with the name-addr parameter of the bottom-
      most Diversion header

      - the privacy entry mapping the privacy parameter of the bottom-
      most Diversion header,

      - an index set to 1.


   For the each Diversion header, the next History-info entries are
   mapped as following:

6.  History-Info header to Diversion header

   As each previous diverting user MUST be present in the received
   History-Info header, one Diversion header entry per diverting user
   MUST be created in order to not to loose any diverting information.

   For each History-Info header containing a cause-param with cause
   value as listed in the [RFC4458]; a Diversion header entry MUST be
   created.  The first History-Info header entry selected will be mapped
   into the last Diversion header entry and so on.

   In this case, the History-Info header MUST be mapped into the
   Diversion header as following:

   Diversion:
   diverting_user3_address;reason="unconditional";counter=1;privacy=off,
   diverting_user2_address;reason="user-busy";counter=1;privacy=full,
   diverting_user1_address;reason="no-answer";counter=1;privacy=off

   Mapped into:

   History-Info:
   <sip: diverting_user1_address; privacy=none >; index=1,
   <sip: diverting_user2_address; privacy=history, reason=SIP;
   cause=408>index=1.1,
   <sip: diverting_user3_address; privacy=none, reason=SIP;
   cause=486>index=1.1.1,
   <sip: last_diverting_target; Reason=SIP; cause=302>index=1.1.1.1,

7.2.  Example with History-Info header changed into Diversion header

   History-Info:
   <sip: diverting_user1_address ;Privacy=history >; index=1,
   <sip: diverting_user2_address; Privacy=none; Reason=SIP;
   cause=302>index=1.1,
   <sip: last_diverting_target; Reason=SIP; cause=486>index=1.1.1

   Mapped into:

   Diversion:
   diverting_user2_address; reason="user-busy"; counter=1; privacy=off,
   diverting_user1_address; reason="unconditional"; counter=1;
   privacy=full

7.3.  Example with two SIP networks using History-Info header
      interworking with a SIP network using Diversion header

   A -> P1 -> B -> C -> P2 -> D-> E
   A, B, C, D and E are users.
   B, C and D have Call Forwarding service invoked.
   P1 and P2 are proxies.
   Only relevant information is shown on the following call flow.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.


9.  Security Considerations

   The use of Diversion header or History-Info header require to apply
   the requested privacy and integrity asked by each diverting user or
   entity.  Without integrity, the requested privacy functions could be
   downgraded or eliminated, potentially exposing identity information.
   Without confidentiality, eavesdroppers on the network (or any
   intermediaries between the user and the privacy service) could see
   the very personal information that the user has asked the privacy
   service to obscure.  Unauthorised insertion, deletion of modification
   of those headers can provide misleading information to users and
   applications.  A SIP entity that can provide a redirection reason in
   a History-Info header or Diversion header SHOULD be able to suppress
