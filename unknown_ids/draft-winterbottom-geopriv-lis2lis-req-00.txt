Internet-Draft                LIS_2_LIS-Req                    June 2007


1.  Introduction

   The architecture of some networks results in more than one operator
   being involved in providing Internet connectivity to an end-point.
   Examples of this type of configuration are prevalent in residential
   broadband access environments where the physical infrastructure is
   owned by one operator, while a third-party ISP provides an IP address
   and layer 3 connectivity to the Internet.  In architectures such as
   these, the Internet connectivity service is dependent on both
   providers.  Similarly, both have information about the connectivity
   of an end-point to the network.  The information that one party
   holds, however, is usually different to the information held by the
   other party, and neither party (on its own) can use the information
   it possesses to yield the physical location of an end-point.
   However, when the connectivity information held by the two parties is
   combined the location of the end-point can be determined.

2.  Terminology

   The key conventions and terminology used in this document are defined
   as follows:

   This document reuses the terms Target, as defined in [RFC3693].

   This document uses the term Location Information Server, LIS, to
   represent a combined Location Server and Location Generator (as
   defined in [RFC3693]) residing inside the local access domain.

   Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS).  A node in a DSL network
   responsible for switching data streams between end-points and
   Internet Service Providers.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Overview

   The Geopriv L7 LCP requirements [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps] describe
   a range of network topologies in which a Target should be able to
   acquire its location from a LIS using an application layer location
   acquisition protocol.  The scope of [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps] is
   such that it does not address specific network topologies that may
   exist inside access network provider domain.  This document provides
   scope and requirements for LIS to LIS communications where the two
   servers are controlled by different operators each running a part of
   the access provider network.  While the same principles may be
   applied to inter-LIS communication occurring between a LIS in the
   customer premise network and the access provider network, operation
   in this configuration is not considered in scope for this document.

   Figure 1 illustrates a typical multi-operator access network where
   physical and switched connectivity is provided by a Regional Access
   Network Provider, and higher layer routing functions are provided by
   an Internet Service provider (ISP).  It is the ISP that owns the
   relationship with the broadband customer, the end-point, and it is
   the ISP LIS that will be contacted by any end-point to provide
   location.  The ISP will know network parameters such as the IP
   address allocated to the end-point, and the associated NAS and port
   the incoming connection is terminated on; but it often will not know
   any information pertaining to connectivity (physical or logical)
   inside the regional access network.  Conversely in many situations
   the regional access provider will not have access to information such
   as the IP address of the end-point or a means to correlate the IP
   address with other known physical parameters.  The regional access
   provider will have access to information from the switch core, the
   access node, and cable termination records, allowing the regional
   access provider LIS to determine a physical location.  Common
   information between the ISP NAS and the Regional Access Provider's
   switching core, such as circuit identifiers, are required in order to
   ensure correct data transmission through the network, and these can
   be used as Target identifiers from the ISP LIS to the Regional Access
   LIS allowing the physical location of an end-point to be retrieved.

   This document describes the requirements for this information flow.

4.  Assumptions

   This section details the high-level assumptions made in this
   document.

   1: A strong trust relationship exists between the regional access
      provider and ISP.


   2: End-points only deal directly with the ISP LIS, and may be totally
      unaware of any regional access provider LIS.  A regional access
      LIS will only ever receive location requests from an ISP LIS.

5.  Requirements

   This section details the requirements that MUST be satisfied by any
   LIS to LIS protocol

   1: Connections (physical and logical) from the ISP LIS to the
      regional access LIS require both ends to authenticate as part of
      connection establishment.  The security of the data conveyed
      between the two servers MUST be ensured for both privacy and
      integrity.


   2: The data used to identify an end-point to the ISP MUST be able to
      be passed to, and be recognizable by the regional access LIS using
      the LIS to LIS protocol.  The data used to identify an end-point
      to the ISP MUST be consistent with the traffic aggregation method
      supported by the Regional Access Network Provider.


   3: Location information returned over a LIS to LIS protocol MUST be
      in PIDF-LO [RFC4119] format, and MUST comply with
      [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile] .


   4: The type of location information requested by the end-point MUST
      be relayed to the regional access LIS by the ISP LIS using the LIS
      to LIS protocol.


   5: The method used by the regional access LIS to determine the
      location of the end-point MUST be provided to the ISP LIS along
      with the determined location.


   6: Any usage-rule preferences provided by the end-point to the ISP
      LIS MUST be included in any location returned to the end-point.


   7: Where location signing is requested by the end-point, this request
      MUST be forwarded to regional access LIS using the LIS to LIS
      protocol


   8: The presentity in the PIDF-LO returned by the regional access LIS
      MUST have been provided by the ISP LIS.  The ISP LIS may create
      the presentity, or it may have received a presentity from the end-
      point.

Internet-Draft                LIS_2_LIS-Req                    June 2007


   9: The protocol MUST provide support for returning and dealing with
      error conditions such as "no location found" or "timeout".

6.  Security Considerations

   LIS to LIS communications are necessary in some network architectures
   and care must be taken to ensure that they are secure both from a
   privacy perspective and from an integrity perspective.  This can be
   achieved in the most part with existing protocol suites, such as TLS,
   using certificates or pre-shared keys.  Another factor that must be
   protected against is the ability of a legitimate ISP LIS asking for
   the location of an end-point associated with a different ISP.
   Operators of regional access servers will need to ensure that this
   operational requirement is met.
