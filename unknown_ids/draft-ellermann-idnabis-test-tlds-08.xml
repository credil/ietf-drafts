        To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion, a few top level
        domain names are reserved for use in private testing, as examples in
        documentation, and the like.  In addition, a few second level domain
        names reserved for use as examples are documented.  This memo

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro"><t>
    The global Internet Domain Name System is documented in
    <xref target="RFC1034" />,
    <xref target="RFC1035" />,
    <xref target="RFC1123" />,
    <xref target="RFC1591" />,
    and numerous additional Requests for Comments. It defines a tree
    of names starting with root, ".", immediately below which are
    top level domain names such as ".com" and ".us". Below top level
    domain names there are normally additional levels of names.
</t><t>
    IPv4 addresses used for tests and in examples are specified in
    <xref target="I-D.iana-rfc3330bis" />, IPv6 addresses used in
    examples are described in <xref target="RFC3849" />; see also
    <xref target="RFC4085" />.
</t><t>
    Fully Qualified Domain Names used in many Internet Protocols
    allow only LDH (letter, digit, hyphen) domain labels as described
    in <xref target="RFC1123" /> and <xref target="RFC4343" />.  The
    letters are ASCII letters; LDH-labels are also known as A-labels
    in the context of IDN (Internationalization of Domain Names) and
    <xref target="IDNAbis" />.
</t><t>
    The key words "MAY", "RECOMMENDED", and "SHOULD" in this memo
    are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.
</t></section>

<section title="TLDs for Testing, &amp; Documentation Examples"><t>
    There is a need for top level domain (TLD) names that can be used for
    creating names which, without fear of conflicts with current or
    future actual TLD names in the global DNS, can be used for private
    testing of existing DNS related code, examples in documentation, DNS
    related experimentation, invalid DNS names, or other similar uses.
</t><t>
    For example, without guidance, a site might set up some local
    additional unused top level domains for testing of its local DNS code
    and configuration. Later, these TLDs might come into actual use on
    the global Internet.  As a result, local attempts to reference the
    real data in these zones could be thwarted by the local test
    versions.  Or test or example code might be written that accesses a
    TLD that is in use with the thought that the test code would only be
    run in a restricted testbed net or the example never actually run.
    Later, the test code could escape from the testbed or the example be
    actually coded and run on the Internet. Depending on the nature of
    the test or example, it might be best for it to be referencing a TLD
    permanently reserved for such purposes.
</t><t>
    To safely satisfy these needs, four domain names are reserved as
    listed and described below.  See also <xref target="i18n" />.

</t><section title='".example"' anchor="example"><t>
    ".example" is RECOMMENDED for use in documentation or as examples.

</t></section><section title='".invalid"'><t>
    ".invalid" is intended for use in online construction of domain
    names that are sure to be invalid, and for which it is obvious at
    a glance that they are invalid.
</t><t>
    Applications MAY treat ".invalid" as what the name says.  For this
    technical reason reserving internationalized ".invalid" TLDs would
    be unwise.

</t></section><section title='".localhost"' anchor="loop"><t>
    The ".localhost" TLD has traditionally been statically defined in
    host DNS implementations as having an address record pointing to
    the loop back IP address and is reserved for such use.  Any other
    use would conflict with widely deployed code which assumes this
    use.
</t><t>
    See <xref target="RFC1122" /> for IPv4 and
    <xref target="RFC4291" /> for IPv6 loop back addresses.

</t></section><section title='".test"' anchor="test"><t>
    ".test" and the new test TLDs in <xref target="i18n" />
    are RECOMMENDED for use in testing of current or new DNS
    related code. Applications SHOULD treat these test TLDs like any
    other TLD; a special handling could defeat the purpose of a test.

</t></section></section>

<section title="Reserved Example Second Level Domain Names"><t>
    The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) also reserves the
    three second level domain names ".example.com", ".example.net",
    and ".example.org", which can be used in examples as explained
    in <xref target="example" />.
</t><t>
    When TLDs offer further second level domains for examples, the
    TLD administrators are encouraged to publish the relevant policies
    in their TLD as an informational RFC.
</t><t>
    The second level domain names "nic", "whois", and "www" are often
    reserved or used for administrative purposes of the TLD, e.g.,
    "whois.example" for the fully qualified domain name of a host with
    a whois server.  As with second level domains for examples this
    can be an issue in the case of a TLD redelegation.
</t><t>
    Please note that there are no globally reserved LDH DNS labels
    below the top level, see <xref target="RFC4367" />.
</t></section>

<section title="Internationalization Considerations" anchor="i18n"><t>
    In 2007 IANA created eleven IDN test TLDs.
    The A-labels, corresponding languages, and IDN
    U-labels are listed below; see <xref target="RFC3490" /> or its
    <xref target="IDNAbis" /> successor for details about IDN.
    Applications SHOULD treat these IDN test TLDs as explained in
    <xref target="test" />.

<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana"><t>
    IANA reserves the TLDs ".example", ".invalid", ".localhost", ".test",
    and eleven IDN test TLDs as noted above. IANA reserves the second
    level domains ".example.com", ".example.net", and ".example.org".
</t><t>
    IANA creates a registry of reserved TLDs; this can be done alongside
    existing IANA TLD registries at the discretion of IANA.  The registry
    should contain references to the relevant specifications, for the
    fifteen reserved TLDs specified here references to this memo will do.
</t><t>
    Additional reserved TLDs require IETF review as defined in
    <xref target="RFC5226" /> section 4.1 in conjunction with
    <xref target="RFC2860" /> section 4.3.
</t><t>
    The <spanx style="strong">technical</spanx> purpose of a reserved TLD
    has to be stated in its specification.
</t><t>
    Proposals to reserve TLD labels not permitted for ordinary TLDs, as
    specified in <xref target="RFC1123" /> among others, e.g., labels not
    starting with a letter, or not following known LDH-rules, are not
    expected to survive IETF review without compelling reasons.
</t></section>

<section title="Security Considerations"><t>
    Confusion and conflict can be caused by the use of a current or
    future top level domain name in experimentation or testing, as an
    example in documentation, to indicate invalid names, or as a synonym
    for the loop back address.  Test and experimental software can escape
    and end up being run against the global operational DNS.  Even
    examples used "only" in documentation can end up being coded and
    released or cause conflicts due to later real use and the possible
    acquisition of intellectual property rights in such "example" names.
</t><t>
    The reservation of several top level domain names for these purposes
    minimizes such confusion and conflict.
</t><t>
    <xref target="RFC4367" /> discusses various false assumptions based
    on domain labels, however this doesn't affect the reserved TLDs in
    this memo.
</t><t>
    Readers need to be aware that the IANA registry of reserved TLDs in
    <xref target="iana" /> won't list all reserved TLDs for specific
    applications and protocols. The registry can only list reserved TLDs
    if somebody bothered to propose it, typically in an Internet-Draft,
    and the proposal was accepted in an IETF review.

    <section title="Educational Info" anchor="info"><t>
        This informative appendix tries to answer three frequently
        asked questions:
    <list style="numbers"><t>
        As of 2008 IANA is the registrant of ".example.edu";
        TLD ".edu" has no contract with ICANN; its administration is
        based on a five years contract with the US DoC renewed in
        2006; see
        <eref target="http://net.educause.edu/edudomain/policy.asp" />.
        Under amendment 6 of their current policy generic names cannot
        be registered. This is not exactly the same situation as
        for say ".example.org", where IANA is the registrant
        <spanx style="strong">and</spanx> registrar.
    </t><t>
        As of 2008 IANA is the registrant of ".example.info";
        TLD ".info" was created by ICANN in 2001. The ".info" registry
        agreement lists reserved DNS labels including "example"; see
        <eref target="http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/info/" />
        appendix 6 (2006) and K (2001), respectively. This is not
        exactly the same situation as for say ".example.org", where
        IANA is the registrant
        <spanx style="strong">and</spanx> registrar.
    </t><t>
        Ignoring <xref target="RFC2965" /> the TLD ".local" issue was
        discussed in a bunch of Internet-Drafts related to AS112,
        zeroconf, and <xref target="RFC3927" />. Presumably TLD ".local"
        should be registered as reserved for technical reasons, but
        deserves its own document with the fine print.
    </t></list></t></section>

    <section title="Document History" anchor="history"><t>
        Changes in version 08:
    </t><t>
        <list style="symbols"><t>
            Moved <xref target="RFC2860" /> to normative, inspired by
            feedback and the precedence in another BCP.
            Added the relevant sections in <xref target="RFC2860" />
            and <xref target="RFC5226" /> to <xref target="iana" />.
        </t><t>
            Added a long blurb that the purpose of reserved TLDs has
            to be noted in their specifications, and that reserving
            TLDs not permitted as ordinary TLDs need very good reasons
            to survive the required IETF review.
        </t><t>
            <xref target="IDNAbis" /> hopefully fixes the &lt;toplabel&gt;
            errata for <xref target="RFC1123" />. This memo isn't the
            place to do this, as the issue is not limited to reserved
            TLDs, tests, and examples.
        </t></list>
    </t><t>
        Changes in version 07:
    </t><t>
        <list style="symbols"><t>
            Kept "nic", "whois", and "www" as known examples why
            there are no globally reserved LDH labels for whatever
            purpose below the top level.
        </t><t>
            Proposals to add ".internal", ".local", ".localdomain", and
            ".uucp" not adopted.  This memo covers known test and example
            TLDs, as well as two other TLDs and three example SLDs
            inherited from <xref target="RFC2606" />.  Reserved TLDs for
            other purposes deserve separate documents.
        </t><t>
            Added a note that internationalizations of ".invalid" are a
            non-starter, as this TLD is expected to be hardwired in
            some applications.  For ".localhost" that should be obvious.
        </t><t>
            Review requests sent at different times to the APPS, general,
            <xref target="IDNAbis" />, INT, and OPS mailing lists.
        </t></list>
    </t><t>
        Changes in version 06:
    </t><t>
        <list style="symbols"><t>
            Explanations of the terms LDH, A-label, and IDN added in
            <xref target="intro" />. Just in case added a reference
            to <xref target="RFC4343" />.
        </t><t>
            Downgraded 3696 to <xref target="RFC1123" />; since March
            2008 the best documentation of top labels is available in
            <eref target="http://rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=1123&amp;eid=1353" />.
        </t></list>
    </t><t>
        Changes in version 05:
    </t><t>
        <list style="symbols"><t>
            Donald offered to co-author this memo.
        </t><t>
            Clarified that there are now additional TLDs recommended for
            tests, not only the original ".test" in <xref target="test" />.
        </t></list>
    </t><t>
        Changes in version 04:
    </t><t>
        <list style="symbols"><t>
            In the "Public Suffix List" debate SM quoted
            <xref target="RFC4085" />, added to <xref target="intro" />.
        </t><t>
            Replaced "A record" by "address record" with references to
            <xref target="RFC1122" /> and <xref target="RFC4291" /> in
            <xref target="loop" />.

            Added IDN test U-labels (in a crude hex. format due to RFC
            layout limitations) with the help of
            <eref target="http://josefsson.org/idn.php/" /> and
            <eref target="http://www.imc.org/idna/do-idna.cgi" />.

        <list style="symbols"><t>
            Swapped IANA and security considerations based on feedback,
            since version 01 the order anyway did not more follow
            <eref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-rfc-editor-rfc2223bis-08#section-4" />.

            Dave Cridland proposed another <xref target="RFC4367" />
            caveat, there are no globally reserved LDH labels below the
            top level.  LDH excludes special cases such as the empty label
            reserved for the root, and leaf labels starting with an
            underscore.
        </t><t>
            The informative <xref target="info" /> hopefully answers
            frequently asked questions about
            ".example.edu", ".example.info", and ".local".

        Changes in version 02:
    </t><t>
        <list style="symbols"><t>
            Added the related <xref target="RFC3849" /> and
            <xref target="I-D.iana-rfc3330bis" /> references.
            Added an <xref target="RFC4367" /> reference to the security
            considerations, as this explains one of many issues with any
            "well-known" label below the top level.
        </t><t>
            IDN test SLDs not yet added, it is not clear if they are also
            reserved TLDs. Any "globally reserved labels" at other levels
            including the second level would be utter dubious.
        </t><t>
            Improved the IANA Considerations <xref target="iana" /> based
            on feedback.  The registry of reserved TLDs needs references
            to the relevant specifications.
        </t><t>
            Added a caveat that the IANA registry of reserved TLDs cannot
            list all obscure ideas of specific applications and protocols;
            somebody has to trigger an IETF review for new registrations.

        Changes in version 01:

        <list style="symbols"><t>
            Various editorial issues found by Tony Hansen fixed.
        </t><t>
            Added an <xref target="IDNAbis" /> reference. The authors believe
            that the IETF is not entitled to decree that ".example.edu"
            belongs to the set of three example-SLDs reserved by IANA.

        <list style="symbols"><t>
            John Klensin suggested clarifying the guidelines for
            examples in <xref target="RFC2606" />, referenced by
            <eref target="http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html" />.
            Documenting the eleven new IDN test TLDs was anyway
            desirable.
