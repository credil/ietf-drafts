   destination address selection mechanism, the host will experience
   some trouble in communication.  RFC 3484 defines both the source and
   destination address selection algorithms, but the multi-prefix
   environment considered here needs additional rules beyond those of
   the default operation.  This document describes the possible problems
   that end hosts could encounter in an environment with multiple
   logical networks.

Internet-Draft            Address Selection PS              October 2007


1.  Introduction

   One physical network can carry multiple logical networks.  In that
   case, an end-host has multiple IP addresses.  In the IPv4-IPv6 dual
   stack environment or in a site connected to both a ULA [RFC4193] and
   Global scope networks, an end-host has multiple IP addresses.  These
   are examples of networks that we focus on in this document.  In such
   an environment, an end-host will encounter some communication
   trouble.

   Inappropriate source address selection at the end-host causes
   unexpected asymmetric routing, filtering by a router or discarding of
   packets bacause there is no route to the host.

   Considering a multi-prefix environment, destination address selection
   is also important for correct or better communication establishment.

   RFC 3484 [RFC3484] defines both source and destination address
   selection algorithms.  In most cases, the host will be able to
   communicate with the targeted host using the algorithms.  However,
   there are still problematic cases such as when multiple default
   routes are supplied.  This document describes such possibilities of
   incorrect address selection, which leads to dropping packets and
   communication failure.

   In addition, the provision of an address policy table is an important
   matter.  RFC 3484 describes all the algorithms for setting the
   address policy table but address policy provisions are not mentioned.
   RFC 3484 only defines how to configure the address policy table
   manually.

1.1.  Scope of this document

   There has been a lot of discussion about "multiple addresses/
   prefixes" but the multi-homing techniques for achieving redundancy
   are out of our scope.  Cooperation with a mechanism like shim6 is
   rather desirable.  We focus on an end-site network environment.  The
   scope of this document is to sort out problematic cases of false
   dropping of the address selection within a multi-prefix environment.

                                [Fig. 1]

   Generally speaking, there is no interaction between next-hop
   determination and address selection.  In this example, when a Host
   sends a packet via Gateway1, the Host does not necessarily choose
   address 2001:db8:1000:1::EUI64 given by Gateway1 as the source
   address.  This causes the same problem as described in the next
   section 'Ingress Filtering Problem'.

                           +------+

                                [Fig. 2]

   When a relatively small site, which we call a "customer network", is
   attached to two upstream ISPs, each ISP delegates a network address
   block, which is usually /48, and a host has multiple IPv6 addresses.

   When the source address of an outgoing packet is not the one that is
   delegated by an upstream ISP, there is a possibility that the packet
   will be dropped at the ISP by its Ingress Filter.  Ingress
   filtering(uRPF: unicast Reverse Path Forwarding) is becoming more
   popular among ISPs to mitigate the damage of DoS attacks.

   In this example, when the Gateway chooses the default route to ISP2
   and the Host chooses 2001:db8:1000:1::EUI64 as the source address for
   packets sent to a host (2001:db8:2000::1) somewhere on the Internet,
   the packets may be dropped at ISP2 because of Ingress Filtering.

2.1.3.  Half-Closed Network Problem

   You can see a second typical source address selection problem in a
   multihome site with global-closed mixed connectivity like in the
   figure below.  In this case, Host-A is in a multihomed network and
   has two IPv6 addresses, one delegated from each of the upstream ISPs.
   Note that ISP2 is a closed network and does not have connectivity to
   the Internet.

                                [Fig. 3]

   You do not need two physical network connections here.  The
   connection from the Gateway to ISP2 can be a logical link over ISP1
   and the Internet.

   When Host-A starts the connection to Host-B in ISP2, the source
   address of a packet that has been sent will be the one delegated from
   ISP2, that is 2001:db8:8000:1::EUI64, because of rule 8 (longest
   matching prefix) in RFC 3484.

   Host-C is located somewhere on the Internet and has IPv6 address
   2001:db8:a000::1.  When Host-A sends a packet to Host-C, the longest
   matching algorithm chooses 2001:db8:8000:1::EUI64 for the source
   address.  In this case, the packet goes through ISP1 and may be
   filtered by ISP1's ingress filter.  Even if the packet is not
   filtered by ISP1, a return packet from Host-C cannot possibly be
   delivered to Host-A because the return packet is destined for 2001:
   db8:8000:1::EUI64, which is closed from the Internet.

   The important point is that each host chooses a correct source
   address for a given destination address as long as NAT does not exist
   in the IPv6 world.

                                [Fig. 4]

   As NAP [I-D.ietf-v6ops-nap] describes, using a ULA may be beneficial
   in some scenarios.  If the ULA is used for internal communication,
   packets with ULA need to be filtered at the Gateway.

   There is no serious problem related to address selection in this
   case, because of the dissimilarity between the ULA and the Global
   Unicast Address.  The longest matching rule of RFC 3484 chooses the
   correct address for both intra-site and extra-site communication.

   In a few years, however, the longest matching rule will not be able
   to choose the correct address anymore.  That is the moment when the
   assignment of those Global Unicast Addresses starts, where the first
   bit is 1.  In RFC 4291 [RFC4291], almost all address spaces of IPv6,
   including those whose first bit is 1, are assigned as Global Unicast
   Addresses.

2.1.5.  Site Renumbering

   RFC 4192 [RFC4192] describes a recommended procedure for renumbering
   a network from one prefix to another.  An autoconfigured address has
   a lifetime, so by stopping advertisement of the old prefix, the
   autoconfigured address is eventually invalidated.

Internet-Draft            Address Selection PS              October 2007


   However, invalidating the old prefix takes a long time.  You cannot
   stop routing to the old prefix as long as the old prefix is not
   removed from the host.  This can be a tough issue for ISP network
   administrators.

2.1.6.  Multicast Source Address Selection

   This case is an example of Site-local or Global prioritization.  When
   you send a multicast packet across site-borders, the source address
   of the multicast packet must be a global scope address.  The longest
   matching algorithm, however, selects a ULA if the sending host has
   both a ULA and a global address.

2.1.7.  Temporary Address Selection

   RFC 3041 [RFC3041] defines a Temporary Address.  The usage of a
   Temporary Address has both pros and cons.  That is good for viewing
   web pages or communicating with the general public, but that is bad
   for a service that uses address-based authentication and for logging
   purposes.

   If you could turn the temporary address on and off, that would be
   better.  If you could switch its usage per service(destination
   address), that would also be better.  The same situation can be found
   when using HA and CoA in a MobileIP network.

2.2.  Destination Address Selection

2.2.1.  IPv4 or IPv6 prioritization

   The default policy table gives IPv6 addresses higher precedence than
   IPv4 addresses.  There seem to be many cases, however, where network
   administrators want to control the address selection policy of end-
   hosts the other way around.

                                [Fig. 6]

   In the figure above, a site has native IPv4 and tunneled-IPv6
   connectivity.  Therefore, the administrator may want to set a higher
   priority for using IPv4 than using IPv6 because the quality of the
   tunnel network seems to be worse than that of the native transport.

2.2.2.  ULA and IPv4 dual-stack environment

   This is a special form of IPv4 and IPv6 prioritization.  When an
   enterprise has IPv4 Internet connectivity but does not yet have IPv6
   Internet connectivity, and the enterprise wants to provide site-local
   IPv6 connectivity, a ULA is the best choice for site-local IPv6
   connectivity.  Each employee host will have both an IPv4 global or
   private address and a ULA.  Here, when this host tries to connect to
   Host-C that has registered both A and AAAA records in the DNS, the
   host will choose AAAA as the destination address and the ULA for the
   source address.  This will clearly result in a connection failure.

2.2.3.  ULA or Global Prioritization

   Differentiating services by the client's source address is very
   common.  IP-address-based authentication is an typical example of
   this.  Another typical example is a web service that has pages for
   the public and internal pages for employees or involved parties.  Yet
   another example is DNS zone splitting.

   However, a ULA and IPv6 global address both have global scope, and
   RFC3484 default rules do not specify which address should be given
   priority.  This point makes IPv6 implementation of address-based
   service differentiation a bit harder.

3.  Conclusion

   We have covered problems related to destination or source address
   selection.  These problems have their roots in the situation where
   end-hosts have multiple IP addresses.  In this situation, every end-
   host must choose an appropriate destination and source address, which
   cannot be achieved only by routers.

   It should be noted that end-hosts must be informed about routing
   policies of their upstream networks for appropriate address
   selection.  A site administrator must consider every possible address
   false-selection problem and take countermeasures beforehand.


4.  Security Considerations

   When an intermediate router performs policy routing (e.g. source
   address based routing), inappropriate address selection causes
   unexpected routing.  For example, in the network described in 2.1.3,



Matsumoto, et al.        Expires April 13, 2008                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft            Address Selection PS              October 2007


   when Host-A uses a default address selection policy and chooses an
   inappropriate address, a packet sent to VPN can be delivered to a
   location via the Internet.  This issue can lead to packet
   eavesdropping or session hijack.

   As documented in the security consideration section in RFC 3484,
   address selection algorithms expose a potential privacy concern.
   When a malicious host can make a target host perform address
   selection, the malicious host can know multiple addresses attached to
   the target host.  In a case like 2.1.4, if an attacker can make Host
   to send a multicast packet and the Host performs the default address
   selection algorithm, the attacker may be able to determine the ULAs
   attached to the Host.

   These security risks have roots in inappropriate address selection.
   Therefore, if a countermeasure is taken, and hosts always select an
   appropriate address that is suitable to a site's network structure
   and routing, these risks can be avoided.
