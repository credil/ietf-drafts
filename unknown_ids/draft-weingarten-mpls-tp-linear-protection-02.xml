      <t>This document describes mechanisms for linear protection of Multi-Protocol 
	  Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Label Switched Paths (LSP) and 
	  Pseudowires (PW) on multiple layers.  Linear protection provides a fast and simple 
	  protection switching mechanism that is especially optimized for a mesh topology.  
	  It provides a clear indication of the protection status.  The mechanisms are 
	  described both at the architectural level as well as providing a protocol that is 
	  used to control and coordinate the protection switching.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>As noted in the architecture for Multi-Protocol Label Switching Transport
	  Profile (MPLS-TP) <xref target='7'/>, the overall architecture framework for 
	  MPLS-TP is based on a profile of the MPLS and Pseudowire (PW) procedures as 
	  specified for the MPLS and (MS-)PW architectures defined in RFC 3031 
	  <xref target='3'/>, RFC 3985 <xref target='5' /> and <xref target='6' />. One 
	  of the basic survivability functions, pointed out by the Survivability Framework 
	  document <xref target='11' />, is that of simple and rapid protection switching 
	  mechanisms for Label Switched Paths (LSP) and Pseudo-wires (PW).</t>
      <t>Protection switching is a fully allocated survivability mechanism. It is 
	  fully allocated in the sense that the route and bandwidth of the recovery path 
	  is reserved for a selected working path.  It provides a fast and simple 
	  survivability mechanism, that allows the network operator to easily grasp the 
	  active state of the network, compared to other survivability mechanisms.</t>

      <t>This draft proposes an architecture and protocol to provide protection for 
	  the different types of point-to-point (p2p) paths supported by MPLS-TP.  These 
	  include LSP, PW, Path Segment Tunnels (PST), and Tandem Connections (TC).  For 
	  unidirectional protection switching a 1+1 architecture is described.  For 
	  bidirectional switching both a 1+1 and a 1:1 architecture are described.</t>
	  <t>In 1+1 unidirectional architecture, a recovery transport path is dedicated to 
	  each working transport path.  Normal traffic is bridged and fed to both the 
	  working and the recovery transport entities by a permanent bridge at the source 
	  of the protection domain.  The sink of the protection domain selects which of the 
	  working or recovery entities to receive the traffic from, based on a predetermined 
	  criteria, e.g. server defect indication.  When used for bidirectional switching 
	  the 1+1 protection architecture must also support a Protection Switching 
	  Coordination (PSC) protocol.  This protocol is used to help synchronize the 
	  decisions of both ends of the protection domain in selecting the proper traffic 
	  flow.</t>
	  <t>In the 1:1 architecture, a recovery transport path is dedicated to the working 
	  transport path.  However, the normal traffic is transmitted only once, on either 
	  the working or the recovery path, by using a selector bridge at the source of the 
	  protection domain.  A selector at the sink of the protection domain then selects 
	  the path that carries the normal traffic.  Since the source and sink need to be 
	  coordinated to ensure that the selector bridge at both ends select the same path, 
	  this architecture must support the PSC protocol.</t>

	  <section title="Definitions and Terminology">
	   
	  <t>Protection domain: Transport path (e.g. LSP, PW, PST, TC) that provides protection 
	  for its normal traffic.  The protection domain consists of the following elements &ndash; 
	  Two end points (East and West) that in each direction one acts as the source and the 
	  other as the sink, a working path, and a recovery path. </t>

      <t>Recovery path: A transport path dedicated to transport normal user traffic in case 
	  of a failure of the Working path.</t>
      
      <t>Working path: A transport path used for transport of normal user traffic, 
	  under normal conditions.</t>

      <t>The terminology used in this document is based on the terminology defined in 
	  <xref target='10' />.  In addition, we use the term LSR to refer to a MPLS-TP 
	  Network Element, whether it is a LSR, LER, T-PE, or S-PE.</t>
      </section>
	</section>

    <section title="Network objectives">
      <t>Linear protection for MPLS-TP should comply with the following network objectives:</t>
	  <t>
	    <list style="symbols">

          <t>Switch time: protection switching should operate as quickly as possible.  A 
		  switching time of less than 50ms has been proposed as a target for certain use cases.  
		  The switching time does not include the detection time and the hold-off time.</t>

          <t>Hold-off times: to allow protection by the layer that is closest to the detected 
		  defect and retain the stability of the network, a hold-off timer should be employed 
		  when a defect is detected.  At the expiration of the hold-off period, the defect 
		  should be rechecked and if still existent the protection mechanism shall be invoked.</t>

          <t>Extent of protection: the protection mechanism should restore interrupted 
		  traffic due to a facility (link or node) failure, within a protection domain.  
		  Traffic terminating at a failed node may be disrupted, however, traffic passing 
		  through to other nodes should be protected.</t>
		  
          <t>Operation modes: the protection mechanism should provide protection for both 
		  unidirectional and bidirectional transport entities.  The protection mechanism should 
		  support both revertive and non-revertive modes of operation.</t>

          <t>Manual control: administrative commands may be provided for manual control of the 
		  protection switching operations.  The following are examples of possible manual 
		  commands: Clear, Forced Switch, Manual Switch (see definitions in <xref target='10' />).</t>
		</list>
	  </t>
	</section>
	
	<section title="Protection architectures">

      <t>The protection mechanism defined here supports transport paths (as defined in 
	  <xref target='2' />') within a mesh-based network.  This includes support for 
	  unidirectional, both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint, and bidirectional 
	  point-to-point paths.  This protection may be supported by different protection 
	  architectures as described in the following subsections.</t>
	  
	  <section title="1+1 Protection architecture">
 
        <t>The 1+1 protection architecture provides for a fully dedicated recovery path in 
	    addition to the configured working path.  Both the recovery and working path MUST support 
	    the full SLA requirements for the traffic between the two end points of the protection 
	    domain.</t>
	  
	    <t>In this architecture (see <xref target="figure 1"/>), all traffic from LSR A to LSR Z 
		is bridged, using the permanent bridge at LSR A, to both transport entities, and LSR Z 
		employs a selector bridge to receive the data from the working path, discarding the 
		packets from the recovery path.</t>
	  
	    <t>In case of a condition, e.g. a failure condition or an operator command, where 
	    protection switching is indicated, LSR Z SHOULD select the data packets from the 
	    recovery path and discard any data packets from the working path.</t>
	  
	    <t>It should be further noted that OAM packets for monitoring the protection domain, 
	    or control plane packets, may be transmitted on the "non-active" transport path.  
	    These packets SHALL NOT be discarded.</t>

	    <t>When using the 1+1 architecture for bidirectional switching, each of the end-points 
	    would have both a permanent bridge and a selector bridge one for each direction.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="1:1 Protection architecture">
	  
        <t>Another option to protect a bidirectional connection is a 1:1 architecture.  This 
		architecture provides for a fully allocated recovery transport path in addition to the 
		working transport path used for normal user data.  In principle, this recovery path 
		MUST support the full capacity and bandwidth of the SLA but may be degraded from the 
		normal working path.</t>

        <t>In this architecture both ends of the protection domain employ a Selector bridge 
		(SB) that selects the transport path to transmit the data packets over.  Under normal 
		conditions the SB selects the working path for transmission of the data packets.  When 
		a condition that triggers protection switching is active, the SB at either end need to 
		select the recovery path for data transmission.</t>

	    </figure>

        <t>In principle, the recovery path could be used for "extra traffic", i.e. preemptible 
	    traffic.  However, if protection switching is in force then this traffic SHALL be pre-empted 
		by the protected data that is being transmitted on this path.  In any case, the recovery 
		path MUST support OAM and protection coordination traffic (see section 6).</t>
      
        <t>This architecture requires communication between the end-points of the protection 
		domain to coordinate the protection state.  In general bidirectional protection 
		switching requires coordination between the end-points and verification that both 
		transmission directions remain on a co-routed bidirectional path.</t>
      
      </section>


      <section title="Protection of P2MP networks">
        <t><xref target='2' /> specifies that all P2MP MPLS-TP connections are 
		unidirectional by nature.  It further requires that these connections should be 
		supported by both 1+1 and 1:1 protection architectures.</t>
		
        <t>When protecting a P2MP network using a 1+1 protection architecture, the basic 
		protection mechanism is still relevant.  The root LSR will bridge the user traffic 
		(using a permanent bridge) to both the working and recovery transport entities.  Each 
		leaf LSR will select the traffic from one transport path according to its own local 
		triggers.  This may lead to a situation where, due to a failure condition on one branch 
		of the network, that some leaf LSRs may select the working transport path, while other 
		leaf LSRs may select traffic from the recovery transport path.</t>
		
        <t>When protecting a P2MP network using 1:1 protection architecture, there is a need 
		for the root LSR to identify the existence of a failure condition on any of the branches 
		of the network.</t>
		
		<t>Editor's note: This requires the use of tools from the OAM toolset <xref target='9' />, 
		and also a return path that can pass the indication back to the root LSR.  This protection 
		architecture, in the P2MP case, also requires that each leaf LSR selects the traffic 
		from the same incoming transport entity that was selected by the root LSR.  When 
		protection switching is triggered, the root LSR selects the recovery transport path 
		to transfer the traffic and each leaf LSR needs to select this same transmission. 
		Endof Editor's note!!</t>
      </section>
	  
	  <section title="Extension to 1:n protection">
	  
	    <t>This is for further study</t>
		
		<t>Editor's note: definition of 1:n protection should be that there is one recovery path 
		that is given a different label relative to each working path that is being protected.  
		When any one of the working paths indicates a failure, then the traffic is redirected 
		to the recovery path, using the dedicated recovery label.  When more than one working 
		path reports a failure, then the path with the highest priority will have its traffic 
		redirected to the recovery path and traffic from other paths will not be protected.   
		It should be noted further that 1:n protection cannot be supported using a single phase 
		protocol, since the coordination of which is the highest priority path and notification 
		to other paths needs acknowledgement, i.e. at least a second phase.</t>
		
		<t>There is a suggestion to have a separate draft for the extension to 1:n protection, 
		that would include a definition to the two-phased protocol.  This draft should only 
		prepare the groundwork of the protocol so as not to preclude the 1:n protection.</t>
		
		<t>This is still under discussion.  End of Editor's note</t>
	  </section>
	  
	  <section title="Revertive and non-revertive switching">
	  
	    <t>In revertive operation, the normal traffic signal is restored to the working transport 
		path after the condition that triggered the switching has cleared.  When a manual operator 
		command (e.g. Forced Switch) has cleared, then the reversion happens immediately.  When 
		a failure or degradation of service has cleared, the reversion may be delayed until the 
		expiry of a Wait-to-restore timer, used to neutralize the effect of intermittent 
		defects.</t>
		
		<t>In non-revertive mode of operation, the normal traffic continues to use the recovery 
		transport path, even after the condition that triggered has cleared.  Eventually, the 
		network may be reverted to use the working transport path, by using an explicit operator 
		command (see section 6.3.5).</t>
		
		<t>The 1+1 protection architecture is often provisioned to operate as non-revertive, 
		since the recovery transport path is fully dedicated in any case and continuing to select 
		it on the sink avoids a second disturbance to the traffic.  There may, however, be 
		certain operator policies that dictate provisioning revertive operation for 1+1 
		protection.</t>
		
		<t>The 1:1 protection architecture is often provisioned to operate in revertive mode.  
		This takes advantage of the (typically) more optimized working transport path, even at 
		the cost of the additional disturbance to traffic from the additional switch.</t>
		
		<t>The configuration of revertive or non-revertive operation SHOULD be the same at 
		both ends of the protection domain.</t>

    <section title="Protection switching logic">
	
	  <section title="Protection switching trigger mechanisms">
      
      <t>The protection switching should be initiated in reaction to any of the following 
	  triggers:</t>
      
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Server layer indication &ndash; if any of the lower layers (e.g. the physical 
		  layer) raises an interrupt indicating that a failure has been detected.</t>

          <t>OAM signalling &ndash; if the OAM continuity and connectivity verification tools 
		  detect that there is a loss of continuity or mis-connectivity or the performance 
		  monitoring indicates a degradation of the utility of the working path for the 
		  current transport path.  In cases of signal degradation, switching to the recovery 
		  path SHOULD only be activated if the recovery path can guarantee better conditions 
		  than the degraded working path.</t>
            
          <t>Control plane &ndash; if there is a control plane active in the network (either 
		  signalling or routing), it may send an indication of problems on the working path.  
		  Protection switching should be initiated as a result , until the problems are 
		  signalled to have cleared.  If the control-plane is based on GMPLS 
		  <xref target='13' /> then the recovery process should comply with the process 
		  described in <xref target='12' />.</t>

          <t>Operator command &ndash; the network operator may issue commands that trigger 
		  protection switching.  The commands that are supported include &ndash; Forced Switch, 
		  Manual Switch, Clear, Lockout of Protection, (see definitions in <xref target='10' />).</t>
		  </list> </t>
		  
	  </section>
	  
	  <section title="Hold-off timer">
	  
        <t>In order to coordinate timing of protection switches at multiple layers, a 
		hold-off timer may be required. Its purpose is to allow, for example, a server 
		layer protection switch to have a chance to fix the problem before switching at 
		a client layer.</t>

        <t>Each protection group should have a provisionable holdoff timer. The suggested 
		range of the holdoff timer is 0 to 10 seconds in steps of 100 ms with an accuracy 
		within 5 ms. The default duration for the holdoff timer is 0 seconds.</t>

        <t>When a failure condition is detected, this will not immediately activate 
		protection switching if the provisioned hold-off timer value is non-zero. Rather, 
		the hold-off timer will be started. When the hold-off timer expires, we check if 
		a failure condition is still present. If there is still a failure condition, then 
		the protection switching is activated, regardless if it is the same failure 
		condition that caused the activation the hold-off timer.</t>
		</section>
 
      <section title="Protection switching control logical architecture">

        <t>Protection switching processes the triggers described above together with the 
		inputs received from the far-end LSR.  These inputs cause the LSR to take certain 
		actions, e.g. switching the Selector Bridge to select the working or recovery path, 
		and to transmit different protocol messages.</t>

        <t><xref target="figure 3" /> describes the logical architecture of the protection 
		switching control. The Local Request logic unit accepts the triggers from the OAM, 
		external operator commands, and from the local control plane (when present) and 
		determines the highest priority request.  This high-priority request is passed to 
		both the PSC Message generator, that will generate the appropriate protocol message 
		to be sent to the far-end LSR, and the Global Request logic, that will cross-check 
		this local request with the information received from the far-LSR.  The Global 
		Request logic then processes these two PSC requests that determines the highest 
		priority request that is passed to the PSC Process logic.  The PSC Process logic uses 
		this input to determine what actions need to be taken, e.g. switching the Selector 
		Bridge, and the current status of the protection domain.</t>
		
		<section title="PSC Status Module">
		  
		  <t>The PSC Control Logic must retain the status of the protection domain.  The 
		  possible different states indicate the current status of the protection environment, 
		  and can be in one of three states:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
             <t>Normal (Idle) state &ndash; When both the recovery and the working paths are 
			 fully allocated and active, data traffic is being transmitted over the working 
			 path, and there are no events being reported within the domain.</t>
             <t>Protecting state &ndash; When the working path has reported a signal failure 
			 or degradation of signal and the data traffic has been redirected to the recovery 
			 path.</t>
             <t>Unavailable state &ndash; When the recovery path is unavailable, either as a 
			 result of reporting a SF or SD condition, or as a result of an administrative 
			 Lockout command.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>This state may affect the actions taken by the control logic, and therefore, the 
		  PSC Status Module transfers the current status to the Local Request Logic.</t>

          <t>See section 6.3.1 for details on what actions are affected by the PSC state.</t>

          </section>
        </section>

      <section title="Protection switching coordination (PSC) protocol">
        <t>Bidirectional protection switching requires coordination between the two 
		end-points in determining which of the two possible paths, the working or recovery 
		path, is operational in any given situation.  When protection switching is 
		triggered as described in section 5.1, the end-points must inform each other of the 
		switch-over from one path to the other in a coordinated fashion.</t>

        <t>There are different possibilities for the type of coordinating protocol. One 
		possibility is a two-phased coordination in which the MEP that is initiating the 
		protection switching sends a protocol message indicating the switch but the actual 
		switch-over is performed only after receiving an &apos;Ack&apos; from the far-end MEP.  The 
		other possibility is a single-phased coordination, in which the initiating MEP 
		switches over to the alternate path and informs the far-end of the switch, and the 
		far-end must complete the switch-over.</t>
		
		<t>In the following sub-sections we describe the protocol messages that should be used 
		between the two end-points of the protection domain.</t>
		
		<t>For the sake of simplicity of the protocol, this protocol is based on the single-phase 
		approach described above.</t>
		
		<t>The protocol messages SHOULD be transmitted over the recovery path only.  
		This allows the transmission of the messages without affecting the normal traffic 
		in the most prevalent case, i.e. the normal state.  In addition, limiting the 
		transmission to a single path avoids possible conflicts and race conditions that 
		could develop if the PSC messages were sent on both paths.</t>

        <section title="Protocol format">
          <t>The protocol messages SHALL be sent over the GACH as described in 
		  <xref target='8' />.  There is a single channel type for the set of PSC messages, 
		  each message will be identified by the first field of the ACH payload as described 
		  below.  PSC messages SHOULD support addressing by use of the method described in 
		  <xref target='8' />.  The following figure shows the format for the full PSC message.</t>

			make for a simpler and more intuitive protocol.  End of editor's note.</t>

            <t>Check priority of the request</t>
			<t>Switch all normal traffic addressed to LSR-A to the recovery path only.</t>
            <t>Begin transmission of a PCS control packet, using GACH, with the appropriate 
			Request code (either Manual switch of Forced switch), the Fpath set to 1, to 
			indicate that the fault/degrade was detected on the working path, and the Path set 
			to 1, indicating that traffic is now being forwarded on the recovery path.  This 
			transmission should be repeated every xx ms for the duration of the switch 
			condition.</t>
          </list>


          <section title="Clearing operator commands">
            <t>The operator may clear the switching condition by issuing a Clear request.  
			This command will cause immediate recovery from the switch that was initiated by 
			any of the previous operator commands, i.e. Forced Switch or Manual Switch.  In 
			addition, a Clear command after a Lockout Protection command should clear the 
			Unavailable state and return the protection domain to the normal state.</t>
            <t>If the Clear request is issued in the absence of a Manual Switch, Forced 
			Switch, or Lockout protection, then it SHALL be ignored.  In the presence of any 
			of these commands, the Clear request SHALL clear the state affected by the 
			operator command.</t>
          </section>
		</section>

      <section title="Recovery from switching">
        <t>When the condition that triggered the protection switching clears, e.g. the cause 
		of the failure condition has been corrected, the operator clears a Manual Switch, then 
		the protection domain SHOULD follow the following procedures:</t>

		<list style="symbols">
          <t>If the network is configured for non-revertive behaviour, then the two LSRs SHOULD 
		  transmit DNR (Request code 0010) messages. When the operator clears the non-revertive 
		  condition, the two LSRs SHOULD return to use of the working transport path and transmit 
		  No request (Request code 0000) messages.</t>

          <t>If the network is recovering from an operator switching command (in revertive mode), 
		  then both LSRs SHOULD return to using the working transport path and transmit No request 
		  (Request code 0000) messages.</t>

          <t>If the network is recovering from a failure or degraded condition (in revertive mode), 
		  then the LSR that detects this recovery SHALL activate a local Wait-to-restore (WTR) 
		  timer (see section 6.3.6.1) to verify that there is not an intermittent failure.  After 
		  the WTR expires, the LSR SHOULD return to using the working transport path and transmit 
		  No request (Request code 0000) messages.</t>
		</list>

		<section title="Wait-to-restore timer">
		  <t>In revertive mode, in order to prevent frequent activation of protection switching due 
		  to an intermittent defect, the working transport path must become stable and fault-free 
		  before reverting to the normal condition.  In order to verify that this is the case a 
		  fixed period of time must elapse before the normal traffic uses the working transport path.  
		  This period, called the WTR period, should be configurable by the operator in 1-minute 
		  intervals within the range 1-12 minutes.  The default value is 5 minutes.</t>

          <t>During this period, if a failure condition is detected on the working transport path, 
		  then the WTR timer is stopped and the normal traffic SHALL continue to be transported over 
		  the recovery transport path.  If the WTR timer expires without being pre-empted by a failure, 
		  then the traffic SHOULD be returned to use the working transport path (as above).</t>

            <t>"Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)" requires a set of procedures 
			for augmenting network layer packets with "label stacks",thereby turning 
			them into "labeled packets". Routers which support MPLS are known as 
			"Label Switching Routers", or "LSRs". In order to transmit a labeled 
			packet on a particular data link, an LSR must support an encoding 
			technique which, given a label stack and a network layer packet, produces 
			a labeled packet. This document specifies the encoding to be used by an 
			LSR in order to transmit labeled packets on Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) 
			data links, on LAN data links, and possibly on other data links as well. 
			On some data links, the label at the top of the stack may be encoded in 
			a different manner, but the techniques described here MUST be used to
			encode the remainder of the label stack. This document also specifies 
			rules and procedures for processing the various fields of the label stack 
			encoding.</t>

           <abstract>
             <t>Network survivability is the network's ability to restore traffic following 
			 failure or attack; it plays a critical factor in the delivery of reliable 
			 services in transport networks. Guaranteed services in the form of Service 
			 Level Agreements (SLAs) require a resilient network that detects facility or 
			 node failures very rapidly, and immediately starts to restore network 
			 operations in accordance with the terms of the SLA. The Transport Profile of 
			 Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP) is a packet transport technology that 
			 combines the packet experience of MPLS with the operational experience of 
			 transport networks like SONET/SDH. It provides survivability mechanisms such 
			 as protection and restoration, with similar function levels to those found in 
			 established transport networks such as in SONET/SDH networks. Some of the 
			 MPLS-TP survivability mechanisms are data plane-driven and are based on MPLS-TP 
			 OAM fault management functions which are used to trigger protection switching 
			 in the absence of a control plane. Other survivability mechanisms utilize the 
			 MPLS-TP control plane. This document provides a framework for MPLS-TP 
			 survivability. </t>
