1.  Introduction

   The Post Office Protocol, Version 3 (POP3), that is defined in RFC
   1939 [RFC1939], is an application-layer protocol used by local e-mail
   clients to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a simple TCP/IP
   connection.  It supports simple download-and-delete requirements for
   access to remote mailboxes (also called a maildrop).

   Initially, POP3 was intended to be used "in the clear".  But since it
   is often employed to transfer sensitive information, there is a need
   to secure POP3 transaction; actually, the only protocol used for this
   purpose is Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (and its
   deprecated predecessor Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) [I.D. draft-
   mavrogiannopoulos-ssl-version3]).  

   Historically, two ways of securing the POP3 connection have been
   deployed (like 2 ways of securing HTTP [RFC2616]; see below).  The
   first includes establishing TLS layer connection during the POP3
   transaction (also known as upgrading to TLS).  It is discussed in
   details in RFC 2595 [RFC2595].  The other one involves establishing
   TLS connection directly before establishing POP3 transaction.  Unlike
   the first one, this way (called "POP3S" throughout this document) has
   never been given an official specification.  (In the case with HTTP

INTERNET DRAFT               POP3 over TLS                  May 15, 2011


   the first way is specified in RFC 2817 [RFC2817]; the second one - in
   RFC 2818 [RFC2818].)

   This memo is to remove this uncertainty; it specifies the POP3S
   protocol in details.  This document updates RFC 1939 [RFC1939].  RFC
   2595 [RFC2595] is also updated by it (see Section 2.5 for
   justification).  This memo also updates the registration of the TCP
   well-known port 995, used with POP3S.  

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  POP3 over TLS Protocol

   This section contains the technical definition of POP3 over TLS
   protocol (POP3S).

2.1. Connection Establishment

   Establishing POP3S connection, the user agent SHALL first request all
   information, necessary for the authentication method, that will be
   used if the client's identity will not be identified during the TLS
   handshake (such information may include user name, password, etc.). 
   Then, the TCP connection [RFC0793] SHALL be established to the
   particular POP3 server on the appropriate TCP port (or 995, if not
   explicitly specified).  

   Once TCP connection is established, TLS handshake [RFC5246] SHALL be
   performed (POP3 client is serving as TLS client here).  Upon
   successful TLS negotiation all data SHALL be sent over TLS layer.  If
   the client has provided an X.509 certificate that can be successfully
   verified by the server, then the client and server SHALL enter the
   TRANSACTION state.  In this case the server SHALL the "+OK" response
   directly after TLS negotiation.

   However, under some circumstances the client's identity cannot be
   identified by the X.509 certificate supplied during the TLS
   handshake.  In this case the server SHALL AUTHORIZATION state; the
   client SHALL then also enter the AUTHORIZATION state and perform the
   authentication choosing the method (for instance, SASL
   [RFC4422][RFC5034]) according to its settings.

   {{TODO: How should the server indicate what state it enters?}}

INTERNET DRAFT               POP3 over TLS                  May 15, 2011


   Anyway, as soon as client is authenticated and enters the TRANSACTION
   state, it begins exchanging POP3 commands and responses with the
   server under TLS layer.

   Please note that the user agent MUST NOT try to establish the SSL 2.0
   connection during POP3S section, per RFC 6176 [RFC6176].

2.2. Data Exchange

   All the data (explicitly, POP3 commands and responses), upon
   successful TLS negotiation, SHALL be sent as TLS "application data".

2.3. Connection Closure

   TLS provides the possibility for secure connection closure. 
   Therefore, upon POP3S transaction closure, the client SHALL initiate
   the exchange of TLS close alerts, that happens before TCP connection
   termination.  When the server receives the TLS close alert, it may be
   sure that no other data will be sent in this connection.  The POP3
   client MAY, after sending TLS close alert, terminate its part of
   connection without waiting a response from the server.

2.4. Default Port

   Historically, the separate TCP port has been used for POP3S - 995. 
   Therefore if there is no explicit specification of port, the client
   SHALL connect the server on it.  Section 4 of this document updates
   IANA registration of this port number with reference to this document
   in the corresponding registry.

2.5. POP3S Disadvantages

   Section 7 of RFC 2595 [RFC2595] contains a few words about the POP3S
   protocol.  It discourages its usage in favor of STLS command,
   described in it, mainly claiming that POP3S, if implemented, would
   cause many misunderstandings regarding the need of new URI scheme,
   separate port numbers, etc.  These issues are fully considered;
   however the usefulness of POP3S certainly overweighs these flaws. 
   This specification updates RFC 2595; however, upon approval of this
   document, it does not ban the usage of STLS command described there -
   it and POP3S may be continued to be used simultaneously.


3.  Security Considerations

   The POP3S protocol is primarily aimed to secure POP3 connection. 
   This is achieved by sending data under TLS layer [RFC5246], that
   provides protection from eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery

   (see RFC 4949 [RFC4949] for definitions of these terms).  Moreover, a
   common POP3S scenario assumes that TLS negotiation also serves to
   authenticate the user agent.

   Because POP3S protocol supposes that authentication during TLS
   negotiation can also fail, it is allowed to use any other
   authentication schemes, such as Kerberos [RFC4752] (see Section 2 of
   this document).  Please refer to Security consideration sections of
   such authentication schemes' specifications for discussion of
   security issues for such certain authentication schemes.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to update the registration of the TCP well-known port
   995 using the following template (see RFC nnnn [I.D. draft-ietf-
   tsvwg-iana-ports]):

   o Service Name: pop3s

   o Transport Protocol: TCP

   o Assignee: IETF <iesg@ietf.org>

   o Contact: IESG <iesg@ietf.org>

   o Description: POP3 over TLS protocol

   o Reference: RFC xxxx (this document - note to RFC Editor)

   o Port Number: 995
