Abstract 
 
   This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label 
   Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). MPLS-TP Requirements and 
   MPLS-TP Framework are defined in [RFC 5654] and [RFC 5921].   
   Extended from MPLS technologies, MPLS-TP introduces new OAM 
   capabilities, transport oriented path protection mechanism, and 
   strong emphasis on static provisioning supported by network 
   management systems. This document addresses the security aspects 
   that are relevant in the context of MPLS-TP specifically. It 
   describes the security requirements for MPLS-TP; potential 
   securities threats and migration procedures for MPLS-TP networks 
   and MPLS-TP inter-connection to MPLS, GMPLS networks. The general 
   security analysis and guidelines for MPLS and GMPLS are addressed 
   in [FRC 5920], will not be covered in this document.

Requirements Language 
 
   Although this document is not a protocol specification, the key 
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC 
   2119]. 
 
    
1. Introduction 
    
    
   1.1. Background and Motivation 
    
   This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label 
   Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  
    
   MPLS-TP Requirements and MPLS-TP Framework are defined in [RFC 
   5654] and [RFC 5921]. The intent of MPLS-TP development is to 
   address the needs for transport evolution, the fast growing 
   bandwidth demand accelerated by new packet based services and 
   multimedia applications, from Ethernet Services, Layer 2 and Layer 
   3 VPNS, triple play to Mobile Access Network (RAN) backhaul, etc. 
   MPLS-TP is based on MPLS technologies to take advantage of the 
   technology maturity, and it is required to maintain the transport 
   characteristics. 
    
   Focused on meeting the transport requirements, MPLS-TP uses a 
   subset of MPLS features, and introduces extensions to reflect the 
   transport technology characteristics. The added functionalities 
     
                                                             [Page 3] 
    
    
   MPLS-TP Security framework                                    
   July 2010 
    
   include in-band OAM, transport oriented path protection and 
   recovery mechanisms, etc. There is strong emphasis on static 
   provisioning supported by Network Management System (NMS) or 
   Operation Support System (OSS). Of course, there are needs for 
   MPLS-TP and MPLS interworking.  
    
   The security aspects for the new extensions which are particularly 
   designed for MPLS-TP need to be addressed. The security models, 
   requirements, threat and defense techniques previously defined in 
   [RFC 5920] can be used for the re-use of the existing 
   functionalities in MPLS and GMPLS, but not sufficient to cover the 
   new extensions. 
    
    
   1.2. Scope 
 
   This document addresses the security aspects that are specific to 
   MPLS-TP. It intends to provide the security requirements for MPLS-
   TP; defines security models which apply to various MPLS-TP 
   deployment scenarios; identifies the potential securities threats 
   and migration procedures for MPLS-TP networks and MPLS-TP inter-
   connection to MPLS, GMPLS networks. Inter-AS and Inter-provider 
   security for MPLS-TP to MPLS-TP connections or MPLS-TP to MPLS 
   connections are discussed, where connections present higher 
   security risk factors than connections for Intra-AS MPLS-TP.  
    
   The general security analysis and guidelines for MPLS and GMPLS are 
   addressed in [RFC 5920], the content which has no new impact to 
   MPLS-TP will not be repeated in this document. Other general 
   security issues regarding transport networks but not specific to 
   MPLS-TP is out of scope as well. Readers may also refer to the 
   "Security Best Practices Efforts and Documents" [opsec effort] and 
   "Security Mechanisms for the Internet" [RFC3631] (if there are 
   linkage to internet in the applications) for general network 
   operation security considerations. This document does not intend to 
   define the specific mechanisms/methods which must be implemented to 
   satisfy the security requirements. 
    
   Issues/Areas to be addressed: 
    
     G-Ach (control plane attack, DoS attack, message intercept, etc.) 
     Spoofing ID 
     Loopback  
     NMS attack 
     NMS and CP interaction 
     MIP/MEP assignment and attacks 
     Topology discovery 
     Data plane authentication

2. Security Reference Models 
    
   This section defines a reference model for security in MPLS-TP 
   networks. 
    
   The models are built on the architecture of MPLS-TP defined in [RFC 
   5921]. The SP boundaries play the important role to determine the 
   security models for any particular deployment. 
 
     
                                                             [Page 6] 
    
    
   MPLS-TP Security framework                                    
   July 2010 
    
   This document defines the zone where the single SP has the total 
   operational control to be a trusted zone for that SP. A primary 
   concern is about security aspects that relate to breaches of 
   security from the "outside" of a trusted zone to the "inside" of 
   this zone.  
    
   2.1.  Security Reference Model 1 
    
   In the reference model 1, a single SP has the total control of 
   PE/T-PE to PE/T-PE of the MPLS-TP network. 
    
   Security reference model 1(a):  
    
   MPLS-TP network with Single Segment Pseudowire (SS-PW) from PE to 
   PE. The trusted zone is PE1 to PE2 as illustrated in Figure 1.

   2.2. Security Reference Model 2 
    
   In the reference model 2, a single SP does not have the total 
   control of PE/T-PE to PE/T-PE of the MPLS-TP network, S-PE and T-PE 
   may be owned by different SPs or SPs and their customers. The MPLS-
   TP network is not contained in one trusted zone.

   The boundaries of a trust domain should be carefully defined when 
   analyzing the security properties of each individual network, as 
   illustrated from the above, the security boundaries determined 
   which model would be applied to the use case analysis. 
    
   A key requirement of MPLS-TP networks is that the security of the 
   trusted zone not be compromised by interconnecting the MPLS-TP, 
   MPLS core infrastructure with another provider's core or T-PE 
   devices, or end users.  
    
   In addition, neighbors may be trusted or untrusted. Neighbors may 
   be authorized or unauthorized. Even though a neighbor may be 
   authorized for communication, it may not be trusted. For example, 
   when connecting with another provider's S-PE to set up Inter-AS 
   LSPs, the other provider is considered an untrusted but may be 
   authorized neighbor.

3. Security Requirements for MPLS-TP 
    
   This section covers security requirements for securing MPLS-TP 
   network infrastructure. The MPLS-TP network can be operated without 
   control plane or via dynamic control planes protocols. The security 
   requirements related to new MPLS-TP OAM, recovery mechanisms, MPLS-
   TP and MPLS interconnection, and MPLS-TP specific operational 
   requirements will be addressed in this section. 
    
   A service provider may choose the implementation options which are 
   best fit for his/her network operation.  This document does not 
   state that a MPLS/GMPLS network must fulfill all security 
   requirements listed to be secure.   
    
   These requirements are focused on: 1) how to protect the MPLS-TP 
   network from various attacks originating outside the trusted zone 
   including those from network users, both accidentally and 
   maliciously; 2) prevention of operational errors resulted from 
   misconfiguration within the trusted zone. 
     
   3.1. Protection within the MPLS-TP Network 
    















     
                                                            [Page 11]

   - MPLS-TP MUST support the physical and logical separation of 
      data plane from the control plane and management plane. That 
      is, if the control plane or/and management plane are attached 
      and cannot function normally, the data plane should continue 
      to forward packets without being impacted. 
    
   - MPLS-TP MUST support static provisioning of MPLS-TP LSP and PW 
      with or without NMS/OSS, without using control protocols. This 
      is particularly important in the case of security model 2(a) 
      and 2(b) where the some or all T-PEs are not in the trusted 
      zone, and in the inter-provider cases in security model 2(c)    
      when the connecting S-PE is in the untrusted zone. 
    
   - MPLS-TP MUST support non-IP path options in addition to IP 
      loopback option. Non-IP path option used in the model 2 may 
      help to lower the potential risk of the S-PE/T-PE in the 
      trusted zone to be attacked. 
    
   - MPLS-TP MUST support authentication of the any control 
      protocol used for MPLS-TP network, as well as MPLS-TP network 
      to dynamic MPLS network inter-connection. 
    
   - MPLS-TP MUST support mechanisms to prevent DOS attack through 
      in-band OAM G-ACh/GAL. 
    
   - MPLS-TP MUST support hiding of the Service Provider 
      infrastructure for all reference models regardless using 
      static configuration or dynamic control plane. 
    
   - Security management requirements [MPLS-TP NM REQ]:  
 
        o MPLS-TP must support management communication channel 
           security secure communication channels MUST be supported 
           for all network traffic and protocols used to support 
           management functions. This MUST include protocols used 
           for configuration, monitoring, configuration backup, 
           logging, time synchronization, authentication, and 
           routing.  The MCC MUST support application protocols that 
           provide confidentiality and data integrity protection. 
           Support the use of open cryptographic algorithms [RFC 
           3871]; Authentication - allow management connectivity and 
           activity only from authenticated entities, and port 
           access control. 
        o Distributed Denial of Service: It is possible to lessen 
           the impact and potential for DoS and DDoS by using secure 
           protocols, turning off unnecessary processes, logging and 

     
                                                            [Page 12]

           monitoring, and ingress filtering.  [RFC 4732] provides 
           background on DOS in the context of the Internet.   
    
      (more to be added) 
          
   - Protection of Operational error 
    
      Due to the extensive use of static provisioning with or 
      without NMS and OSS, the prevention of configuration errors 
      should be addressed as major security requirements. 
       
      (to be added) 
    
    
4. Security Threats 
    
   This section discusses the various network security threats that 
   may endanger MPLS-TP networks.  The discussion is limited to those 
   threats that are unique to MPLS-TP networks or that affect MPLS-TP 
   network in unique ways. 
    
 
   A successful attack on a particular MPLS-TP network or on a SP's 
   MPLS-TP infrastructure may cause one or more of the following ill 
   effects: 
    
    1. Observation, modification, or deletion of a provider's or 
      user's data, as well as replay or insertion of inauthentic data 
      into a provider's or user's data stream, traffic pattern 
      analysis. 
 
      These types of attacks apply to MPLS-TP traffic in a similar way 
      of MPLS traffic regardless how the LSP is set up. 
    
    2. Attacks on GAL label, BFD messages:  
      1) GAL label or BFD label manipulation: including insertion of 
   false label or messages, or modification, or removal the GAL labels 
   or messages by attackers. 
      2) DOS attack through in-band OAM G-ACH/GAL, and BFD messages. 
    
    3. Disruption of a provider's and/or user's connectivity, or 
      degradation of a provider's service quality. 
    
      1) Provider connectivity attacks:  
      - In the case of NMS is used for LSP set-up, the attacks would 
      be through the attack of NMS. 


     
                                                            [Page 13] 
    
    
   MPLS-TP Security framework                                    
   July 2010 
    
      - In the case of dynamic is used for dynamic provisioning, the 
      attack would be on dynamic control plane. Most aspects are 
      addressed in [RFC 5920].  
       
      2) User connectivity attack. This would be similar as PE/CE 
      access attack in typical MPLS networks, addressed in [RFC 5920]. 
    
    4. Probing a provider's network to determine its configuration, 
      capacity, or usage.  
       
      These types of attack can happen through NMS attacks in the case 
      of static provisioning, or through control plane attacks as in 
      dynamic MPLS networks. It can also be combined attacks. 
    
    
   It is useful to consider that threats, whether malicious or 
   accidental, may come from different categories of sources.  For 
   example they may come from: 
    
    - Other users whose services are provided by the same MPLS-TP  
      core. 
    - The MPLS-TP SP or persons working for it. 
    - Other persons who obtain physical access to a MPLS-TP SP's site. 
    - Other persons who use social engineering methods to influence  
      the behavior of a SP's personnel. 
    - Users of the MPLS-TP network itself. 
    - Others, e.g., attackers from the other sources, Internet if 
   connected. 
    - Other SPs in the case of MPLS-TP Inter-provider connection. The 
      provider may or may not be using MPLS-TP. 
    - Those who create, deliver, install, and maintain software for  
      network equipment. 
 
   Given that security is generally a tradeoff between expense and 
   risk, it is also useful to consider the likelihood of different 
   attacks occurring.  There is at least a perceived difference in the 
   likelihood of most types of attacks being successfully mounted in 
   different environments, such as: 
    
    - A MPLS-TP network inter-connecting with another provider's core 
    - A MPLS-TP configuration transiting the public Internet  
    
   Most types of attacks become easier to mount and hence more likely 
   as the shared infrastructure via which service is provided expands 
   from a single SP to multiple cooperating SPs to the global 
   Internet.  Attacks that may not be of sufficient likeliness to 
   warrant concern in a closely controlled environment often merit 
   defensive measures in broader, more open environments. In closed 
     
                                                            [Page 14]

   communities, it is often practical to deal with misbehavior after 
   the fact: an employee can be disciplined, for example. 
    
   The following sections discuss specific types of exploits that 
   threaten MPLS-TP networks. 
    
   4.1. Attacks on the Control Plane 
    
 
   - MPLS-TP LSP creation by an unauthorized element 
 
   - LSP message interception 
 
   - Attacks on G-Ach 
 
   - Attacks against LDP 
 
   - Attacks against RSVP-TE 
 
   - Attacks against GMPLS 
    
   - Denial of Service Attacks on the Network Infrastructure 
    
    
   - Attacks on the SP's MPLS/GMPLS Equipment via Management 
      Interfaces 
   - Social Engineering Attacks on the SP's Infrastructure 
   - Cross-Connection of Traffic between Users 
   - Attacks against Routing Protocols 
   - Other Attacks on Control Traffic 
    
   4.2. Attacks on the Data Plane 
    
   This category encompasses attacks on the provider's or end user's 
   data.  Note that from the MPLS-TP network end user's point of view, 
   some of this might be control plane traffic, e.g. routing protocols 
   running from user site A to user site B via IP or non-IP 
   connections, which may be some type of VPN. 
    
    
   - Unauthorized Observation of Data Traffic 
 
   - Modification of Data Traffic 
 
   - Insertion of Inauthentic Data Traffic: Spoofing and Replay 
 
   - Unauthorized Deletion of Data Traffic

5. Defensive Techniques for MPLS-TP Networks 
    
   The defensive techniques discussed in this document are intended to 
   describe methods by which some security threats can be addressed.  
   They are not intended as requirements for all MPLS-TP 
   implementations.  The MPLS-TP provider should determine the 
   applicability of these techniques to the provider's specific 
   service offerings, and the end user may wish to assess the value of 
   these techniques to the user's service requirements. The 
   operational environment determines the security requirements. 
   Therefore, protocol designers need to provide a full set of 
   security services, which can be used where appropriate. 
    
   The techniques discussed here include encryption, authentication, 
   filtering, firewalls, access control, isolation, aggregation, and 
   others.  
 
   5.1. Authentication 
    
   To prevent security issues arising from some DoS attacks or from 
   malicious or accidental misconfiguration, it is critical that 
   devices in the MPLS-TP should only accept connections or control 
   messages from valid sources.  Authentication refers to methods to 
   ensure that message sources are properly identified by the MPLS-TP 
   devices with which they communicate.  This section focuses on 
   identifying the scenarios in which sender authentication is 
   required and recommends authentication mechanisms for these 
   scenarios. 
  

  5.1.1. Management System Authentication 
 
   Management system authentication includes the authentication of a 
   PE to a centrally-managed network management or directory server 
   when directory-based "auto-discovery" is used.  It also includes 
   authentication of a CE to the configuration server, when a 
   configuration server system is used. 
    
   Authentication should be bi-directional, including PE or CE to 
   configuration server authentication for PE or CE to be certain it

  5.1.2. Peer-to-Peer Authentication 
 
   Peer-to-peer authentication includes peer authentication for 
   network control protocols and other peer authentication (i.e., 
   authentication of one IPsec security gateway by another). 
    
   Authentication should be bi-directional, including S-PE, T-PE, PE 
   or CE to configuration server authentication for PE or CE to be 
   certain it is communicating with the right server. 

  5.1.3. Cryptographic Techniques for Authenticating Identity 
    
   Cryptographic techniques offer several mechanisms for 
   authenticating the identity of devices or individuals. These 
   include the use of shared secret keys, one-time keys generated by 
   accessory devices or software, user-ID and password pairs, and a 
   range of public-private key systems. Another approach is to use a 
   hierarchical Certification Authority system to provide digital 
   certificates. 
    
  
   5.2. Access Control Techniques 
    
   - Access Control to Management Interfaces 
    
   Most of the security issues related to management interfaces can be 
   addressed through the use of authentication techniques as described 
   in the section on authentication.  However, additional security may 
   be provided by controlling access to management interfaces in other 
   ways. 
    
   The Optical Internetworking Forum has done relevant work on 
   protecting such interfaces with TLS, SSH, Kerberos, IPsec, WSS, 
   etc. See OIF-SMI-01.0 "Security for Management Interfaces to 
   Network Elements" [OIF-SMI-01.0], and "Addendum to the Security for 
   Management Interfaces to Network Elements" [OIF-SMI-02.1]. See also 
   the work in the ISMS WG. 
    
   Management interfaces, especially console ports on MPLS-TP devices, 
   may be configured so they are only accessible out-of-band, through 
   a system which is physically or logically separated from the rest 
   of the MPLS-TP infrastructure. 
    
   Where management interfaces are accessible in-band within the MPLS-
   TP domain, filtering or firewalling techniques can be used to 
   restrict unauthorized in-band traffic from having access to 
   management interfaces.  Depending on device capabilities, these 
     
                                                            [Page 17]

   filtering or firewalling techniques can be configured either on 
   other devices through which the traffic might pass, or on the 
   individual MPLS-TP devices themselves. 
    
   5.3. Use of Isolated Infrastructure 
 
   One way to protect the infrastructure used for support of MPLS-TP 
   is to separate the resources for support of MPLS-TP services from 
   the resources used for other purposes  
    
 
   5.4. Use of Aggregated Infrastructure 
    
   In general, it is not feasible to use a completely separate set of 
   resources for support of each service. In fact, one of the main 
   reasons for MPLS-TP enabled services is to allow sharing of 
   resources between multiple services and multiple users. Thus, even 
   if certain services use a separate network from Internet services, 
   nonetheless there will still be multiple MPLS-TP users sharing the 
   same network resources.  
    
    
   In general, the use of aggregated infrastructure allows the service 
   provider to benefit from stochastic multiplexing of multiple bursty 
   flows, and also may in some cases thwart traffic pattern analysis 
   by combining the data from multiple users. However, service 
   providers must minimize security risks introduced from any 
   individual service or individual users.  
    
   5.5. Service Provider Quality Control Processes 
    
   5.6. Verification of Connectivity 
 
   In order to protect against deliberate or accidental misconnection, 
   mechanisms can be put in place to verify both end-to-end 
   connectivity and hop-by-hop resources. These mechanisms can trace 
   the routes of LSPs in both the control plane and the data plane. 
    
6. Monitoring, Detection, and Reporting of Security Attacks 
    
   MPLS-TP network and service may be subject to attacks from a 
   variety of security threats.  Many threats are described in Section 
   3 of this document.  Many of the defensive techniques described in 
   this document and elsewhere provide significant levels of 
   protection from a variety of threats.  However, in addition to 
   employing defensive techniques silently to protect against attacks, 
   MPLS-TP services can also add value for both providers and 

     
                                                            [Page 18]

   customers by implementing security monitoring systems to detect and 
   report on any security attacks, regardless of whether the attacks 
   are effective. 
    
   Attackers often begin by probing and analyzing defenses, so systems 
   that can detect and properly report these early stages of attacks 
   can provide significant benefits. 
    
   Information concerning attack incidents, especially if available 
   quickly, can be useful in defending against further attacks.  It 
   can be used to help identify attackers or their specific targets at 
   an early stage.  This knowledge about attackers and targets can be 
   used to strengthen defenses against specific attacks or attackers, 
   or to improve the defenses for specific targets on an as-needed 
   basis.  Information collected on attacks may also be useful in 
   identifying and developing defenses against novel attack types. 
    
 
7. Security Considerations 
 
    
   Security considerations constitute the sole subject of this memo 
   and hence are discussed throughout.   
 
   The document describes a variety of defensive techniques that may 
   be used to counter the suspected threats.  All of the techniques 
   presented involve mature and widely implemented technologies that 
   are practical to implement. 
 
   The document evaluates MPLS-TP security requirements from a 
   customer's perspective as well as from a service provider's 
   perspective.  These sections re-evaluate the identified threats 
   from the perspectives of the various stakeholders and are meant to 
   assist equipment vendors and service providers, who must ultimately 
   decide what threats to protect against in any given configuration 
   or service offering. 
    
    
8. IANA Considerations 
    
   This document contains no new IANA considerations.
