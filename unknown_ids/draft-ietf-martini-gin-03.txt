   Registration for Multiple Phone Numbers in the Session Initiation
                             Protocol (SIP)
                       draft-ietf-martini-gin-03

Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism by which a SIP server acting as a
   traditional Private Branch Exchange (PBX) can register with a SIP
   Service Provider (SSP) to receive phone calls for terminals
   designated by phone numbers.  In order to function properly, this
   mechanism relies on the fact that the phone numbers are fully
   qualified and globally unique.

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing          May 2010


1.  Introduction

   One of SIP's primary functions is providing rendezvous between users.
   By design, this rendezvous has been provided through a combination of
   the server look-up procedures defined in RFC 3263 [5], and the
   registrar procedures described in RFC 3261 [4].

   The intention of the original protocol design was that any user's AOR
   would be handled by the authority indicated by the hostport portion
   of the AOR.  The users registered individual reachability information
   with this authority, which would then route incoming requests
   accordingly.

   In actual deployments, some SIP servers have been deployed in
   architectures that, for various reasons, have requirements to provide
   dynamic routing information for large blocks of AORs, where all of
   the AORs in the block were to be handled by the same server.  For
   purposes of efficiency, many of these deployments do not wish to
   maintain separate registrations for each of the AORs in the block.
   This leads to the desire for an alternate mechanism for providing
   dynamic routing information for blocks of AORs.

   Although the use of REGISTER to update reachability information for
   multiple users simultaneously is somewhat beyond the original
   semantics defined for REGISTER, this approach has seen significant
   deployment in certain environments.  In particular, deployments in
   which small to medium SIP PBX servers are addressed using E.164
   numbers have used this mechanism to avoid the need to maintain DNS
   entries or static IP addresses for the PBX servers.

   In recognition of the momentum that REGISTER-based approaches have
   seen in deployments, this document defines a REGISTER-based approach
   that is tailored to E.164-addressed terminals in a SIP PBX
   environment.  It does not address registration of SIP URIs in which
   the user portion is not an E.164 number.


2.  Constraints

   The following paragraph is perhaps the most important in
   understanding the reasons for the design decisions made in this
   document.

   Within the problem space that has been established for this work,
   several constraints shape our solution.  These are being defined in
   the MARTINI requirements document [8].  In terms of impact to the
   solution at hand, the following two constraints have the most
   profound effect: (1) The PBX cannot be assumed to be assigned a



Roach                   Expires November 22, 2010               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing          May 2010


   static IP address; and (2) No DNS entry can be relied upon to
   consistently resolve to the IP address of the PBX.


3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

   Further, the term "SSP" is meant as an acronym for a "SIP Service
   Provider," while the term "PBX" is used to indicate a SIP Private
   Branch Exchange.

      Indented portions of the document, such as this one, form non-
      normative, explanatory sections of the document.


4.  Mechanism Overview

   The overall mechanism is achieved using a REGISTER request with a
   specially-formatted Contact URI.  This document also defines an
   option tag that can be used to ensure a registrar and any
   intermediaries understand the mechanism described herein.

   The Contact URI itself is tagged with a URI parameter to indicate
   that it actually represents a multitude of phone-number-associated
   contacts.

   We also define some lightweight extensions for Globally Routable UA
   URIs (GRUU) to allow the use of public and temporary GRUUs assigned
   by the SSP.

   Aside from these extensions, the REGISTER message itself is processed
   by a registrar in the same way as normal registrations: by updating
   its location service with additional AOR to Contact bindings.

   Note that the list of phone numbers associated with a PBX is a matter
   of local provisioning at the SSP and at the PBX.  The mechanism
   defined in this document does not provide any means to detect or
   recover from provisioning mismatches (although the registration event
   package can be used as a standardized means for auditing such phone
   numbers; see Section 7.2.1).


5.  Registering for Multiple Phone Numbers

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing          May 2010


5.1.  PBX Behavior

   To register for multiple phone numbers, the PBX sends a REGISTER
   message to the SSP.  This REGISTER varies from a typical register in
   two important ways.  First, it must contain an option tag of "gin" in
   both a "Require" header field and a "Proxy-Require" header field.
   (The option tag "gin" is an acronym for "generate implicit numbers".)
   Second, in at least one "Contact" header field, it must include a
   Contact URI that contains the URI parameter "bnc", and no user
   portion (hence no "@" symbol).  A URI with a "bnc" parameter MUST NOT
   contain a user portion.  Except for the SIP URI "user" parameter,
   this URI MAY contain any other parameters that the PBX desires.
   These parameters will be echoed back by the SSP in any requests bound
   for the PBX.

   Because of the constraints discussed in Section 2, the host portion
   of the Contact URI will generally contain an IP address, although
   nothing in this mechanism enforces or relies upon that fact.  If the
   PBX operator chooses to maintain DNS entries that resolve to the IP
   address of his PBX via RFC 3263 resolution procedures, then this
   mechanism works just fine with domain names in the Contact header
   field.

   The URI parameter indicates that special interpretation of the
   Contact URI is necessary: instead of representing a single, concrete
   Contact URI to be inserted into the location service, it represents a
   multitude of Contact URIs (one for each associated phone number),
   semantically resulting in a multitude of AOR-to-Contact rows in the
   location service.

   Any PBX implementing the registration mechanism defined in this
   document MUST also support the Path mechanism defined by RFC 3327
   [9], and MUST include a 'path' option-tag in the Supported header
   field of the REGISTER request (which is a stronger requirement than
   imposed by the Path mechanism itself).  This behavior is necessary
   because proxies between the PBX and the Registrar may need to insert
   Path header field values in the REGISTER request for this document's
   mechanism to function properly, and per RFC 3327 [9], they can only
   do so if the UAC inserted the option-tag in the Supported header
   field.  In accordance with the procedures defined in RFC 3327 [9],
   the PBX is allowed to ignore the Path header fields returned in the
   REGISTER response.

5.2.  Registrar Behavior

   The registrar, upon receipt of a REGISTER message containing at least
   one Contact header field with a "bnc" parameter will use the value in
   the "To" header field to identify the PBX for which registration is



Roach                   Expires November 22, 2010               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing          May 2010


   being requested.  It then authenticates the PBX (using, e.g., SIP
   Digest authentication, mutual TLS, or some other authentication
   mechanism).  After the PBX is authenticated, the registrar updates
   its location service with a unique AOR to Contact mapping for each of
   the phone numbers associated with the PBX.  Semantically, each of
   these mappings will be treated as a unique row in the location
   service.  The actual implementation may, of course, perform internal
   optimizations to reduce the amount of memory used to store such
   information.

   For each of these unique rows, the AOR will be in the format that the
   SSP expects to receive from external parties (e.g.
   "sip:+12145550102@ssp.example.com"), and the corresponding Contact
   will be formed by adding to the REGISTER's Contact URI a user portion
   containing the fully-qualified, E.164-formatted phone number
   (including the preceding "+" symbol) and removing the "bnc"
   parameter.  Aside from the initial "+" symbol, this E.164-formatted
   number MUST consist exclusively of digits from 0 through 9, and
   explicitly MUST NOT contain any visual separator symbols (e.g., "-",
   ".", "(", or ")").  For example, if the "Contact" header field
   contains the URI <sip:198.51.100.3:5060;bnc>, then the Contact value
   associated with the aforementioned AOR will be
   <sip:+12145550102@198.51.100.3:5060>.

   Although the SSP treats this registration as a number of discrete
   rows for the purpose of re-targeting incoming requests, the renewal,
   expiration, and removal of these rows is bound to the registered
   "bnc" contact.  In particular, this means that REGISTER requests that
   attempt to de-register a single phone number that has been implicitly
   registered MUST NOT remove that phone number from the bulk
   registration.  A further implication of this property is that an
   individual extension that is implicitly registered may also be
   explicitly registered using a normal, non-bulk registration (subject
   to SSP policy).  If such a registration exists, it is refreshed
   independently of the bulk registration, and is not removed when the
   bulk registration is removed.

   A registrar that receives a URI with both a "bnc" parameter and a
   user portion MAY discard the user portion and process the request as
   if it were not present.  Alternately, the registrar MAY return a 400
   (Bad Request) error in response.

      Note that this requirement is talking about the user portion of a
      URI:

      sip:+12145550100@example.com;user=phone
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing          May 2010


   A Registrar compliant with this document MUST support the Path
   mechanism defined in RFC 3327 [9].

   Aside from the "bnc" and "autouser" parameters, all URI parameters
   present on the "Contact" URI in the REGISTER message MUST be copied
   to the Contact value stored in the location service.

5.3.  SIP URI "user" Parameter Handling

   Some PBXes require inbound requests containing a phone number to
   include a "user=phone" parameter.  Others do not function properly
   when this parameter is present.  To accommodate this variation in
   behavior, we define a new URI parameter, "autouser", which indicates
   whether the SSP is required to include a "user" indication.

   To accommodate proper handling of further extensions to this
   mechanism, PBXes MUST NOT include a "user" parameter on a URI that
   also contains a "bnc" parameter.  A registrar that receives such a
   URI MAY discard the "user" parameter and process the request as if
   the parameter were not present.  Alternately, it MAY return a 400
   (Bad Request) error in response.

      Note that this requirement is talking about the user parameter of
      a URI:

      sip:+12145550100@example.com;user=phone
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^

   If the PBX requires arriving Request URIs to be tagged with a "user"
   parameter, it can include an "autouser" parameter on its contact URI,
   with a value of "true."  When the SSP sends a request to the PBX
   associated with an "autouser" registration, it MUST determine the
   correct value for the "user" parameter in the Request-URI.  (The
   "correct value" will generally be a matter of provisioning, although
   alternate mechanisms for determining this value are also valid.)  For
   example, if the the inbound request contains a telephone number
   formatted as a telephone-subscriber -- which will always be the case
   unless additional extensions are employed -- this value will be
   "phone."  If the correct value is anything other than the default
   value of "ip", then the SSP MUST include a "user" parameter on the
   Request URI.  If the value is "ip", then the SSP MAY include it.

      Although the mechanism defined in this document only deals with
      phone numbers, future protocol extensions may specify behavior for
      non-phone-number-based user portions, which would require the SSP
      to make decisions about the "correct value" for the "user"
      parameter.  It is also conceivable that new values might be added
      to the "user" parameter.

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing          May 2010


   As a corollary, if the registering PBX does not include an
   "autouser=true" parameter, any SSP using the procedures defined in
   this document MUST NOT include a "user" parameter on the resulting
   Request-URI.

   If a URI contains a "bnc" parameter, but no "autouser" parameter, the
   value of "autouser" is presumed to be "false."


6.  SSP Processing of Inbound Phone Number Requests

   In general, after processing the AOR to Contact mapping described in
   the preceding section, the SSP Proxy/Registrar (or equivalent entity)
   performs traditional Proxy/Registrar behavior, based on the mapping.
   For any inbound SIP requests whose AOR indicates an E.164 number
   assigned to one of the SSP's customers, this will generally involve
   setting the target set to the registered contacts associated with
   that AOR, and performing request forwarding as described in section
   16.6 of RFC 3261 [4].  An SSP using the mechanism defined in this
   document MUST perform such processing for inbound INVITE requests and
   SUBSCRIBE requests to the "reg" event package (see Section 7.2.2),
   and SHOULD perform such processing for all other method types,
   including unrecognized SIP methods.


7.  Interaction with Other Mechanisms

   The following sections describe the means by which this mechanism
   interacts with relevant REGISTER-related extensions currently defined
   by the IETF.

   Currently, the descriptions are somewhat informal, and omit some
   details for the sake of brevity.  If the MARTINI working group
   expresses interest in furthering the mechanism described by this
   document, they will be fleshed out with more detail and formality.

7.1.  Globally Routable User-Agent URIs (GRUU)

   To enable advanced services to work with terminals behind a SIP PBX,
   it is important that the GRUU mechanism defined by RFC 5627 [13] work
   correctly with the mechanism defined by this document -- that is,
   that User Agents services by the PBX can acquire and use GRUUs for
   their own use.

7.1.1.  Public GRUUs

   When a PBX registers a Bulk Number Contact (a Contact with a "bnc"
   parameter), and also invokes GRUU procedures for that Contact during



Roach                   Expires November 22, 2010               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing          May 2010


   registration, then the SSP will assign a public GRUU to the PBX in
   the normal fashion.  Because the URI being registered contains a
   "bnc" parameter, the GRUU will also contain a "bnc" parameter.  In
   particular, this means that the GRUU will not contain a user portion.

   When a terminal registers with the PBX using GRUU procedures for a
   Contact, the PBX adds an "sg" parameter to the GRUU parameter it
   received from the SSP.  This "sg" parameter contains a disambiguation
   token that the PBX can use to route the request to the proper user
   agent.

   So, for example, when the PBX registers with the following contact
   header field:

   Contact: <sip:198.51.100.3;bnc>;
     +sip.instance="<urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6>"

   Then the SSP may choose to respond with a Contact header field that
   looks like this:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:198.51.100.3;bnc>;
   pub-gruu="sip:ssp.example.com;bnc;gr=urn:
   uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6";
   +sip.instance="<urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6>"
   ;expires=7200
   </allOneLine>

   When its own terminals register, the PBX can then add whatever device
   identifier it feels appropriate in an "sg" parameter, and present
   this value to its own terminals.  For example, assume the terminal
   associated with the phone number "+12145550102" sent the following
   Contact header field in its register:

   Contact: <sip:line-1@10.20.1.17>;
     +sip.instance="<urn:uuid:d0e2f290-104b-11df-8a39-0800200c9a66>"

   The PBX will add an "sg" parameter to the pub-gruu it received from
   the SSP with a token that uniquely identifies the device (possibly
   the URN itself; possibly some other identifier); insert a user
   portion containing the fully-qualified E.164 number associated with
   the terminal; and return the result to the terminal as its public
   GRUU.  The resulting Contact header field would look something like
   this:

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing          May 2010


   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:line-1@10.20.1.17>;
   pub-gruu="sip:+12145550102@ssp.example.com;bnc;gr=urn:
   uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6;sg=00:05:03:5e:70:a6";
   +sip.instance="<urn:uuid:d0e2f290-104b-11df-8a39-0800200c9a66>"
   ;expires=3600
   </allOneLine>

   When an incoming request arrives at the SSP for a GRUU corresponding
   to a bulk number contact ("bnc"), the SSP performs slightly different
   processing for the GRUU than a Proxy/Registrar would.  When the GRUU
   is re-targeted to the registered bulk number contact, the SSP MUST
   copy the "sg" parameter from the GRUU to the new target.  The PBX can
   then use this "sg" parameter to determine which user agent the
   request should be routed to.  For example, the first line of an
   INVITE request that has been re-targeted to the PBX for the terminal
   shown above would look like this:

   <allOneLine>
   INVITE sip:+12145550102@198.51.100.3;gr=urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-
   11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6;sg=00:05:03:5e:70:a6 SIP/2.0
   </allOneLine>

7.1.2.  Temporary GRUUs

   Temporary GRUUs are used to provide anonymity for the party creating
   and sharing the GRUU.  Being able to correlate two temporary GRUUs as
   having originated from behind the same PBX violates this principle of
   anonymity.  Consequently, rather than relying upon a single,
   invariant identifier for the PBX in its UA's temporary GRUUs, we
   define a mechanism whereby the SSP provides the PBX with sufficient
   information for the PBX to mint unique temporary GRUUs.  These GRUUs
   have the property that the SSP can correlate them to the proper PBX,
   but no other party can do so.  To achieve this goal, we use a slight
   modification of the procedure described in appendix A.2 of RFC 5627
   [13].

   The PBX must be able to construct a temp-gruu in a way that the SSP
   can decode.  In order to ensure that the SSP can decode GRUUs, we
   need to standardize the algorithm for creation of temp-gruus at the
   PBX.  This allows the SSP to reverse the algorithm to identify the
   registration entry that corresponds to the GRUU.

   It is equally important that no party other than the SSP is capable
   of decoding a temporary GRUU, including other PBXes serviced by the
   SSP.  To achieve this property, an SSP that supports temporary GRUUs
   MUST create and store an asymmetric key pair, {K_e1,K_e2}.  K_e1 is
   kept secret by the SSP, while K_e2 is shared with the PBXes via

   provisioning.

   All base64 encoding discussed in the following sections MUST use the
   character set and encoding defined in RFC 2045 [1], except that any
   trailing "=" characters are discarded on encoding, and added as
   necessary to decode.

7.1.2.1.  Generation of temp-gruu-cookie by the SSP

   An SSP that supports temporary GRUUs MUST include a "temp-gruu-
   cookie" parameter on all "bnc" Contact header fields in a 200-class
   REGISTER response.  This "temp-gruu-cookie" MUST have the following
   properties:

   1.  It can be used by the SSP to uniquely identify the registration
       to which it corresponds.
   2.  It cannot be modified by the recipient to hijack calls intended
       for another PBX.
   3.  It cannot be replayed at a later date to hijack calls intended
       for another PBX.
   4.  It is encoded using base64.  This allows the PBX to decode it
       into as compact a form as possible for use in its calculations.
   5.  It is of a fixed length.  This allows for extraction of it once
       the PBX has concatenated a distinguisher onto it.

   The above properties can be met using the following algorithm, which
   is non-normative.  Implementors may chose to implement any algorithm
   of their choosing for generation of the temp-gruu-cookie, as long as
   it fulfills the five properties listed above.

      The SSP registrar maintains a counter, I. this counter is 48 bits
      long, and initialized to zero.  This counter is persistently
      stored, using a back-end database or similar technique.  When the
      SSP registrar creates the first temporary GRUU for a particular
      PBX and instance ID, the SSP registrar notes the current value of
      the counter, I_i, and increments the counter in the database.  The
      SSP registrar then maps I_i to the "bnc" AOR template and instance
      ID using the database, a persistent hash-map or similar
      technology.  If the registration expires such that there are no
      longer any contacts with that particular instance ID bound to the
      GRUU, the SSP registrar removes the mapping.  Similarly, if the
      temporary GRUUs are invalidated due to a change in Call-ID, the
      SSP registrar removes the current mapping from I_i to the AOR and
      instance ID, notes the current value of the counter I_j, and
      stores a mapping from I_j to the "bnc" AOR template and instance
      ID.  Based on these rules, the hash-map will contain a single
      mapping for each "bnc" AOR template and instance ID for which
      there is a currently valid registration.

      The SSP registrar maintains a symmetric key SK_a, which is
      regenerated every time the counter rolls over or is is reset.
      When the counter rolls over or is reset, the SSP registrar
      remembers the old value of SK_a for a while.  To generate a temp-
      gruu-cookie, the SSP registrar computes:


         SA = HMAC-SHA256-80(SK_a, I_i)
         temp-gruu-cookie = base64enc(I_i || SA)


7.1.2.2.  Generation of temp-gruu by the PBX

   A PBX that issues temporary GRUUs to its terminals MUST maintain an
   HMAC key, PK_a.  This value is used to validate that incoming GRUUs
   were generated by the PBX.

   To generate a new temporary GRUU for use by its own terminals, the
   PBX MUST generate a random distinguisher value D. The length of this
   value is up to implementors, but MUST be long enough to prevent
   collisions among all the temporary GRUUs issued by the PBX.  A size
   of 80 bits or longer is RECOMMENDED.  The PBX then MUST calculate:


     M    = base64dec(SSP-cookie) || D
     E    = RSA-Encrypt(K_e2, M)
     PA   = HMAC(PK_a, E)

     Temp-Gruu-userpart = "tgruu." || base64(E) || "." || base64(PA)


   where || denotes concatenation.  "HMAC" represents any suitably
   strong HMAC algorithm; see RFC 2104 [2] for a discussion of HMAC
   algorithms.  One suitable HMAC algorithm for this purpose is HMAC-
   SHA256-80.

   Finally, the PBX adds a "gr" parameter to the temporary GRUU that can
   be used to uniquely identify the UA registration record to which the
   GRUU corresponds.  The means of generation of the "gr" parameter are
   left to the implementor, as long as they satisfy the properties of a
   GRUU as described in RFC 5627 [13].

      One valid approach for generation of the "gr" parameter is
      calculation of "E" and "A" as described in Appendix A.2 of RFC
      5627 [13], and forming the "gr" parameter as:


         gr = base64enc(E) || base64enc(A)

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing          May 2010


   Using this procedure may result in a temporary GRUU returned to the
   registering UA by the PBX that looks similar to this:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:line-1@10.20.1.17>

   ;expires=3600
   </allOneLine>

7.1.2.3.  Decoding of temp-gruu by the SSP

   When the SSP proxy receives a request in which the user part begins
   with "tgruu.", it extracts the remaining portion, and splits it at
   the "." character into E' and PA'.  It discards PA'.  It then
   computes E by performing a base64 decode of E'.  Next, it computes:


     M = RSA-Decrypt(K_e1, E)


   The SSP proxy extracts the fixed-length temp-gruu-cookie information
   from the beginning of this M, and discards the remainder (which will
   be the distinguisher added by the PBX).  It then validates this temp-
   gruu-cookie.  If valid, it uses it to locate the corresponding PBX
   registration record, and routes the message appropriately.

      If the non-normative, exemplary algorithm described in
      Section 7.1.2.1 is used to generate the temp-gruu-cookie, then
      this identification is performed by splitting the temp-gruu-cookie
      information into its 48-bit counter I and 80-bit HMAC.  It
      validates that the HMAC matches the counter I, and then uses
      counter I to locate the PBX registration record in its map.  If
      the counter has rolled over or reset, this computation is
      performed with the current and previous SK_a.

7.1.2.4.  Decoding of temp-gruu by the PBX

   When the PBX receives a request in which the user part begins with
   "tgruu.", it extracts the remaining portion, and splits it at the "."
   character into E' and PA'.  It then computes E and PA by performing a
   base64 decode of E' and PA' respectively.  Next, it computes:


     PAc = HMAC(PK_a, E)

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing          May 2010


   where HMAC is the HMAC algorithm used for the steps in
   Section 7.1.2.2.  If this computed value for PAc does not match the
   value of PA extracted from the GRUU, then the GRUU is rejected as
   invalid.

   The PBX then uses the value of the "gr" parameter to locate the UA
   registration to which the GRUU corresponds, and routes the message
   accordingly.

7.2.  Registration Event Package

   As this mechanism inherently deals with REGISTER behavior, it is
   imperative to consider its impact on the Registration Event Package
   defined by RFC 3680 [11].  In practice, there will be two main use
   cases for subscribing to registration data: learning about the
   overall registration state for the PBX, and learning about the
   registration state for a single PBX phone number.

7.2.1.  PBX Aggregate Registration State

   If the PBX (or another interested and authorized party) wishes to
   monitor or audit the registration state for all of the phone numbers
   currently registered to that PBX, it can subscribe to the SIP
   registration event package at the PBX's main URI -- that is, the URI
   used in the "To" header field of the REGISTER message.

   The NOTIFY messages for such a subscription will contain a body that
   contains one record for each phone number associated with the PBX.
   The AORs will be in the format expected to be received by the SSP
   (e.g., "sip:+12145550105@ssp.example.com"), and the Contacts will
   correspond to the mapped Contact created by the registration (e.g.,
   "sip:+12145550105@98.51.100.3").

   In particular, the "bnc" parameter is forbidden from appearing in the
   body of a reg-event notify.

7.2.2.  Individual Phone Number Registration State

   OPEN ISSUE (issue #36): Exactly how GIN should handle this aspect of
   the "reg" event is still open for discussion.  This section will be
   updated to reflect consensus once it has been determined.

   As described in Section 6, the SSP will generally retarget all
   requests addressed to a phone number owned by a PBX to that PBX
   according to the mapping established at registration time.  Although
   policy at the SSP may override this generally expected behavior,
   proper behavior of the registration event package requires that all
   "reg" event SUBSCRIBE requests are processed by the PBX.  As a



Roach                   Expires November 22, 2010              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing          May 2010


   consequence, the requirements on an SSP for processing registration
   event package SUBSCRIBE requests are not left to policy.

   If the SSP receives a SUBSCRIBE request for the registration event
   package with a Request-URI that indicates a contact registered via
   the "Bulk Number Contact" mechanism defined in this document, then it
   MUST proxy that SUBSCRIBE to the PBX in the same way that is would
   proxy an INVITE bound for that AOR.

   Defining the behavior in this way is important, since the reg-event
   subscriber is interested in finding out about the comprehensive list
   of devices associated with the phone number.  Only the PBX will have
   authoritative access to this information.  For example, if the user
   has registered multiple terminals with differing capabilities, the
   SSP will not know about the devices or their capabilities.  By
   contrast, the PBX will.

7.3.  Client-Initiated (Outbound) Connections

   RFC 5626 [12] -- needs analysis.  Some people think it might "just
   work."

7.4.  Non-Adjacent Contact Registration (Path) and Service Route
      Discovery

   RFC 3327 [9] defines a means by which a registrar and its associated
   proxy can be informed of a route that is to be used between the proxy
   and the registered user agent.  The scope of the route created by a
   "Path" header field is contact-specific; if an AOR has multiple
   contacts associated with it, the routes associated with each contact
   may be different from each other.

   At registration time, any proxies between the user agent and the
   registrar may add themselves to the Path.  By doing so, they request
   that any requests destined to the user agent as a result of the
   associated registration include them as part of the Route towards the
   User Agent.  Although the Path mechanism does deliver the final Path
   value to the registering UA, UAs typically ignore the value of the
   Path.

   To provide similar functionality in the opposite direction -- that
   is, to establish a route for requests sent by a registering UA -- RFC
   3608 [10] defines a means by which a UA can be informed of a route
   that is to be used by the UA to route all outbound requests
   associated with the AOR used in the registration.  This information
   is scoped to the AOR within the UA, and is not specific to the
   Contact (or Contacts) in the REGISTER request.

   The registrar unilaterally generates the values of the service route
   using whatever local policy it wishes to apply.  Although it is
   common to use the Path and/or Route information in the request in
   composing the Service-Route, registrar behavior is not constrained in
   any way that requires it to do so.

   In considering the interaction between these mechanisms and the
   registration of multiple AORs in a single request, implementors of
   proxies, registrars, and intermediaries must keep in mind the
   following issues, which stem from the fact that GIN effectively
   registers multiple AORs and multiple Contacts.

   First, all location service records that result from expanding a
   single "bnc" Contact will necessarily share a single path.  Proxies
   will be unable to make policy decisions on a contact-by-contact basis
   regarding whether to include themselves in the path.  Second, and
   similarly, all AORs on the PBX that are registered with a common
   REGISTER message will be forced to share a common Service-Route.

   One interesting technique that Path and Service-Route enable is the
   inclusion of a token or cookie in the user portion of the Service-
   Route or Path entries.  This token or cookie may convey information
   to proxies about the identity, capabilities, and/or policies
   associated with the user.  Since this information will be shared
   among several AORs and several Contacts when multiple AOR
   registration is employed, care should be taken to ensure that doing
   so is acceptable for all AORs and all Contacts registered in a single
   REGISTER message.

       will insert the "Path" value indicated by the PBX at
       registration time in a "Route" header field, and

9.  Requirements Analysis

   The document "Requirements for multiple address of record (AOR)
   reachability information in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"
   [8] contains a list of requirements and desired properties for a
   mechanism to register multiple AORs with a single SIP transaction.
   This section evaluates those requirements against the mechanism
   described in this document.

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing          May 2010


   REQ1 - The mechanism MUST allow a SIP-PBX to enter into a trunking
   arrangement with an SSP whereby the two parties have agreed on a set
   of telephone numbers deemed to have been assigned to the SIP-PBX.

      The requirement is satisfied.

   REQ2 - The mechanism MUST allow a set of assigned telephone numbers
   to comprise E.164 numbers, which can be in contiguous ranges,
   discrete, or in any combination of the two.

      The requirement is satisfied; the DIDs associated with a
      registration is established by bilateral agreement between the SSP
      and the PBX, and is not part of the mechanism described in this
      document.

   REQ3 - The mechanism MUST allow a SIP-PBX to register reachability
   information with its SSP, in order to enable the SSP to route to the
   SIP-PBX inbound requests targeted at assigned telephone numbers.

      The requirement is satisfied.

   REQ4 - The mechanism MUST NOT prevent UAs attached to a SIP-PBX
   registering with the SIP-PBX on behalf of AORs based on assigned
   telephone numbers in order to receive requests targeted at those
   telephone numbers, without needing to involve the SSP in the
   registration process.

      The requirement is satisfied; in the presumed architecture, PBX
      terminals register with the PBX, an require no interaction with
      the SSP.

   REQ5 - The mechanism MUST allow a SIP-PBX to handle internally
   requests originating at its own UAs and targeted at its assigned
   telephone numbers, without routing those requests to the SSP.

      The requirement is satisfied; PBXes may recognize their own DID
      and their own GRUUs, and perform on-PBX routing without sending
      the requests to the SSP.

   REQ6 - The mechanism MUST allow a SIP-PBX to receive requests to its
   assigned telephone numbers originating outside the SIP-PBX and
   arriving via the SSP, so that the PBX can route those requests
   onwards to its UAs, as it would for internal requests to those
   telephone numbers.

      The requirement is satisfied

   REQ7 - The mechanism MUST provide a means whereby a SIP-PBX knows

Internet-Draft    Globally Identifiable Number Routing          May 2010


   which of its assigned telephone numbers an inbound request from its
   SSP is targeted at.

      The requirement is satisfied.  For ordinary calls and calls using
      Public GRUUs, the DID is indicated in the user portion of the
      Request-URI.  For calls using Temp GRUUs constructed with the
      mechanism described in Section 7.1.2, the "gr" parameter provides
      a correlation token the PBX can use to identify which terminal the
      call should be routed to.

   REQ8 - The mechanism MUST provide a means of avoiding problems due to
   one side using the mechanism and the other side not.

      The requirement is satisfied through the 'gin' option tag and the
      'bnc' Contact parameter.

   REQ9 - The mechanism MUST observe SIP backwards compatibility
   principles.

      The requirement is satisfied through the 'gin' option tag.

   REQ10 - The mechanism MUST work in the presence of intermediate SIP
   entities on the SSP side of the SIP-PBX-to-SSP interface (i.e.,
   between the SIP-PBX and the SSP's domain proxy), where those
   intermediate SIP entities need to be on the path of inbound requests
   to the PBX.

      The requirement is satisfied through the use of the Path mechanism
      defined in RFC 3327 [9]

   REQ11 - The mechanism MUST work when a SIP-PBX obtains its IP address
   dynamically.

      The requirement is satisfied by allowing the PBX to use an IP
      address in the Bulk Number Contact URI contained in a REGISTER
      Contact header field.

   REQ12 - The mechanism MUST work without requiring the SIP-PBX to have
   a domain name or the ability to publish its domain name in the DNS.

      The requirement is satisfied by allowing the PBX to use an IP
      address in the Bulk Number Contact URI contained in a REGISTER
      Contact header field.

   REQ13 - For a given SIP-PBX and its SSP, there MUST be no impact on
   other domains, which are expected to be able to use normal RFC 3263
   procedures to route requests, including requests needing to be routed
   via the SSP in order to reach the SIP-PBX.

      The requirement is satisfied by allowing the domain name in the
      Request URI used by external entities to resolve to the SSP's
      servers via normal RFC 3263 resolution procedures.

   REQ14 - The mechanism MUST be able to operate over a transport that
   provides integrity protection and confidentiality.

      The requirement is satisfied; nothing in the proposed mechanism
      prevent the use of TLS between the SSP and the PBX.

   REQ15 - The mechanism MUST support authentication of the SIP-PBX by
   the SSP and vice versa.

      The requirement is satisfied; PBXes may employ either SIP digest
      authentication or mutually-authenticated TLS for authentication
      purposes.

   REQ16 - The mechanism MUST allow the SIP-PBX to provide its UAs with
   public or temporary Globally Routable UA URIs (GRUUs) [13].

      The requirement is satisfied via the mechanisms detailed in
      Section 7.1.

   REQ17 - The mechanism MUST NOT preclude the ability of the SIP-PBX to
   route on-PBX requests directly, without hair-pinning the signaling
   through the SSP.

      The requirement is satisfied; PBXes may recognize their own DID
      and their own GRUUs, and perform on-PBX routing without sending
      the requests to the SSP.  (Note that this requirement duplicates
      REQ5, and will probably be removed in a future version of the
      requirements document.)

   REQ18 - The mechanism MUST work over any existing transport specified
   for SIP, including UDP.

      The requirement is satisfied to the extent that UDP can be used
      for REGISTER requests in general.  The application of certain
      extensions and/or network topologies may exceed UDP MTU sizes, but
      such issues arise both with and without the mechanism described in
      this document.  This document does not exacerbate such issues.

   DES1 - The mechanism SHOULD allow an SSP to exploit its mechanisms
   for providing SIP service to ordinary subscribers in order to provide
   a SIP trunking service to SIP-PBXes.

      The desired property is satisfied; the routing mechanism described
      in this document is identical to the routing performed for singly-
      registered AORs.

   DES2 - The mechanism SHOULD scale to SIP-PBX's of several thousand
   assigned telephone numbers.

      The desired property is satisfied; nothing in this document
      precludes DID pools of arbitrary size.

   DES3 - The mechanism SHOULD scale to support several thousand SIP-
   PBX's on a single SSP.

      The desired property is satisfied; nothing in this document
      precludes an arbitrary number of PBXes from attaching to a single
      SSP.

   DES4 - The mechanism SHOULD require relatively modest changes to a
   substantial population of existing SSP and SIP-PBX implementations,
   in order to encourage a fast market adoption of the standardized
   mechanism.

      The desired property is difficult to evaluate in the context of
      any solution.  The mechanism proposed in this document uses the
      REGISTER method, which is the method preferred by many existing
      PBX deployments.  The handling of request routing logic is nearly
      identical to that of RFC 3261 proxy/registrars, allowing
      implementors to leverage existing proxy/registrar code.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new SIP option tag to indicate support for
   the mechanism it defines, plus two new SIP URI parameters.

10.1.  New SIP Option Tag

   This section defines a new SIP option tag per the guidelines in
   Section 27.1 of RFC 3261[4].
   Name:  gin
   Description:  This option tag is used to identify the extension that
      provides Registration for Multiple Phone Numbers in SIP.  When
      present in a Require or Proxy-Require header field of a REGISTER
      request, it indicates that support for this extension is required
      of registrars and proxies, respectively, that are a party to the
      registration transaction.

   Reference:  RFCXXXX (this document)

10.2.  New SIP URI Parameters

   This specification defines two new SIP URI parameters, as per the
   registry created by RFC 3969 [7].

10.2.1.  'bnc' SIP URI paramter

   Parameter Name:  bnc
   Predefined Values:  No (no values are allowed)
   Reference:  RFCXXXX (this document)

10.2.2.  'sg' SIP URI paramter

   Parameter Name:  sg
   Predefined Values:  No
   Reference:  RFCXXXX (this document)

10.2.3.  'autouser' SIP URI paramter

   Parameter Name:  autouser
   Predefined Values:  Yes ('true' and 'false')
   Reference:  RFCXXXX (this document)

10.3.  New SIP Header Field Parameter

   This section defines a new SIP header field parameter per the
   registry created by RFC3968 [6].

   Header field:  Contact
   Parameter name:  temp-gruu-cookie
   Predefined values:  none
   Reference:  RFCXXXX (this document)


11.  Security Considerations

   There are certainly security implications associated with the
   mechanisms described in this document, mostly dealing with the
   unprecedented semantic inclusion of multiple AORs in a single
   REGISTER request.  This section will be formulated following an
   analysis of the security impact of GIN on Path, Service-Route, and
   Outbound.
