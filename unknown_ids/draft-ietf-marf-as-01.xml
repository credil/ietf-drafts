			<t> RFC 5965 defines an extensible, machine-readable
			    format intended for mail operators to report
			    feedback about received email to other parties.
			    This document describes one common method for
			    utilizing this format for reporting at scale
			    between large mailbox providers, and from large
			    mailbox providers to other mail sending
			    entities. </t>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t> The Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) was initially
			    developed for two very specific use cases.
			    Initially, it was intended to be used for
			    reporting feedback between large email operators,
			    or from large email operators to end user network
			    access operators, any of whom could be presumed to
			    have automated abuse-handling systems.
			    Secondarily, it  is used by those same large mail
			    operators to send those same reports to other
			    entities, including those involved in sending bulk
			    email for commercial purposes.  In either case,
			    the reports would be triggered by direct end user 
			    action such as clicking on a "report spam" button
			    in their email client. </t>
				
			<t> Though other uses for the format defined in
			    <xref target="RFC5965"/> have been discussed (and
			    may be documented similarly in the future), those
			    were (and remain) the primary applications. </t>
				
			<t> Further introduction to this topic may be found
			    in <xref target="RFC6449"/>. </t>

		<section title="Definitions">
			<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
			    "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
			    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
			    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are
			    to be interpreted as described in
       			    <xref target="RFC2119"/>, and are intended
			    to replace the Requirement Levels
			    described in Section 3.3 of
			    <xref target="RFC2026"/>. </t>
			
			<t> Some of the terminology used in this
			    document is taken from
			    <xref target="RFC5598"/>. </t>
							
			<t> "Mailbox Provider" refers to an
			    organization that accepts, stores, and
			    offers access to <xref target="RFC5322"/>
			    messages ("email messages") for end users.
			    Such an organization has typically
			    implemented SMTP
			    (<xref target="RFC5321"/>), and might
			    provide access to messages through IMAP
			    (<xref target="RFC3501"/>), POP
			    (<xref target="RFC1939"/>), a proprietary
			    interface designed for HTTP
			    (<xref target="RFC2616"/>), or a
			    proprietary protocol. </t>

			<t>
			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> A Mailbox Provider receives reports of
				    abusive or unwanted mail from its users,
				    most often by providing a "report spam"
				    button (or similar nomenclature) in the
				    MUA.  The method of transferring this
				    message and any associated metadata from
				    the MUA to the Mailbox Provider's ARF
				    processing system is not defined by any
				    standards document, but is discussed
				    further in Section 3.2 of
				    <xref target="RFC6449"/>.  Policy concerns
				    related to the collection of this data
				    are discussed in Section 3.4 of
				    that document. </t>

				<t> The Mailbox Provider SHOULD process the
				    reports to improve its spam filtering
				    systems.  The design of these systems is
				    discussed in <xref target="RFC2505"/> and
				    elsewhere. </t>
							
				<t> The Mailbox Provider SHOULD send reports
				    to relevant parties who have requested
				    to receive such reports.  The reports MUST
				    be formatted per <xref target="RFC5965"/>,
				    and transmitted as an email message
				    (<xref target="RFC5322"/>), typically
				    using SMTP (<xref target="RFC5321"/>).
				    The process whereby such parties may 
				    request the reports is discussed in
				    Section 3.5 of
				    <xref target="RFC6449"/>.</t>
					
				<t> The reports SHOULD use
				    "Feedback-Type: abuse", but MAY use other
				    types as appropriate.  However, the
				    Mailbox Provider generating the reports
				    SHOULD NOT assume that the operator
				    receiving the reports will treat different
				    Feedback-Types differently. </t>

				<t> The reports SHOULD include the following
				    optional fields whenever practical:
				    Original-Mail-From, Arrival-Date,
				    Source-IP, Original-Rcpt-To.  Other
				    optional fields MAY be included, as the
				    implementer feels is appropriate. </t>

				<t> Ongoing maintenance of an ARF processing
				    system is discussed in Section 3.6 of
				    <xref target="RFC6449"/>. </t>

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> At the time this document is being
				    written, for the use cases described here,
				    mail operators need to proactively request
				    a stream of ARF reports from Mailbox
				    Providers.   Recommendations for preparing
				    to make that request are discussed in
				    Section 4.1 of
				    <xref target="RFC6449"/>. </t>
						
				<t> Mail operators MUST be prepared to receive
				    reports formatted per
				    <xref target="RFC5965"/> as email
				    messages (<xref target="RFC5322"/>) over
				    SMTP (<xref target="RFC5321"/>).  These
				    and other types of email messages that
				    may be received are discussed in
				    Section 4.2 of
				    <xref target="RFC6449"/>. </t>
						
				<t> Mail operators SHOULD utilize an automated
				    system to receive and process these
				    reports, as discussed in Section 4.4 of
				    <xref target="RFC6449"/>. </t>
						
				<t> That system MUST accept all Feedback-Types
				    defined in <xref target="RFC5965"/> or
				    extensions to it, but implementors
				    SHOULD NOT assume that Mailbox Providers
				    will make use of any Feedback-Type other
				    than "abuse".  Additional logic may be
				    required to separate different types of
				    abuse reports after receipt. </t>
						
				<t> Implementors SHOULD NOT expect all Mailbox
				    Providers to include the same optional
				    fields. </t>
						
				<t> Actions that mail operators might take upon
				    receiving a report (or multiple reports)
				    are discussed in Section 4.3 of
				    <xref target="RFC6449"/>. </t>

		<section title="Other Applications">
			<t> What is described here is the most common
			    application of <xref target="RFC5965"/>, and
			    provides a starting point for additional
			    applications, but it is certainly not the only
			    possible application.  Other uses for ARF could 
			    include direct complaint submissions from MUAs,
			    reports triggered by mail sent to "spam trap"
			    or "honeypot" addresses without human involvement,
			    reports of authentication failures, virus reports,
			    and so forth.  These applications might be
			    described in future IETF documents. </t>
