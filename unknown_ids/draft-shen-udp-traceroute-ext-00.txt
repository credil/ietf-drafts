Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to UDP traceroute messages that
   allows the UDP traceroute probe packets to be authenticated by the
   intermediate nodes and the destination node.  This extension can also
   include requests for node specific information that the sender is
   interested to receive from one or more nodes via the traceroute
   replies.

1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Traceroute is a tool widely used in the diagnosis of network
   problems.  Majority of the traceroute tools are implemented by
   sending out UDP [RFC0768] probe messages and receiving ICMP messages.

   Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP/ICMPv6) [RFC0792] [RFC4443]
   has been extended to support multi-part message inside ICMP
   [RFC4884].  Some of the applications [I-D.atlas-icmp-unnumbered]
   [RFC4950] [I-D.shen-icmp-routing-inst] are designed mainly for
   internal network troubleshooting by network operators.  Network
   providers may want to limit those applications only to trusted
   senders of traceroute probes due to security or policy reasons.

   Although one may employ a rudimentary control mechanism to limit the
   trusted senders by defining access control lists specifying IPv4/IPv6
   source addresses of the UDP traceroute message, such mechanism is
   deemed configuration intensive, static, and error-prone.  Moreover,
   such mechanism would be susceptible to address spoofing.
   Additionally, such mechanism does not provide the sender with dynamic
   control of the different kind of extensions to be requested.

   This document defines an extension for UDP traceroute messages to
   optionally include authentication signature.  The intermediate and
   destination nodes can authenticate the sender of the traceroute
   packet before providing the requested information in the traceroute
   response.

   This document also includes an Information-Request TLV for the
   traceroute extension.  This TLV specifies the types of information
   the sender expects to be included in the traceroute response (i.e.,
   in the ICMP message elicited by the UDP packet and generated by the
   intermediate or destination node or nodes).

   This extension is backwards compatible with the existing Internet
   traceroute mechanism, and it is applied to both IPv4 and IPv6
   networks.

   This extension is applicable to only the UDP type of traceroute
   probe, similar scheme might be used with other types of traceroute
   probe and it is outside the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft          UDP Traceroute Extension           December 2007


3.  UDP Traceroute Message Extension

   This proposed extension is to reserve the lowest 4 bits in the UDP
   source port field, and a traceroute structure within UDP data field.

3.1.  Original Length Field

   This "original length" field is defined as the lowest nibble of the
   UDP source port field, and specifies the position at which the
   traceroute data structure begins.  The value represents 32-bit words
   ranges from 0x0 to 0xF, with value 0xF as reserved.  Thus the
   position of the traceroute data structure can start from 0 to 56
   octets inside UDP data field.  The "original length" field value 0xF
   indicates there is no traceroute data structure inside the UDP data
   field.

   The "original length" field is defined within UDP "source port" as
   the following:


    0                   1
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       |Ori-Len|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Ori-Len: 4 bits.  The value (Ori-Len) represents the traceroute data
            structure start position in 32-bit words.  The Ori-Len value
            0xF is reserved.

3.2.  UDP Traceroute Structure

   The UDP traceroute structure starts in UDP data field location from 0
   to 56 octets specified in the "original length" in 32-bit boundary.
   It MUST have exactly one traceroute common header followed by one or
   more UDP traceroute TLVs.

3.2.1.  Traceroute Common Header

   The Common Header is a 8 octets structure has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |Version|        Length         |           Checksum            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                  Magic-Number (0x54726163)                    |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The fields of the Common Header are defined as follows:

   Version: 4 bits.  It is defined as 1 in this document.

   Length:  12 bits.  The total length of the traceroute data structure
            specifying number of 32-bit words (includes the common
            header and all the TLVs).

   Checksum:  16 bits.  The one's complement of the one's complement sum
            of the traceroute data structure, with the checksum field
            replaced by zero for the purpose of computing the checksum.

   Magic Number:  32 bits.  It is defined as Hex value of 0x54726163 in
            this document.  This is used mainly for structure
            identification of this extension version.

3.2.2.  Traceroute TLV

   Traceroute TLVs (Type-Length-Value tuples) have the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |             Type              |            Length             |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                             Value                             |
     .                                                               .
     .                                                               .
     .                                                               .

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type:    16 bits.

   Length:  16 bits. length of the Value field in octets.

   Value:   depends on the Type.  It is zero padded to align to a
            4-octet boundary.

   This document defines two TLVs below.

3.2.2.1.  Traceroute Authentication TLV (Keyed MD5)

   The Keyed MD5 TLV for authentication has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |     Type = 1 (Keyed MD5)      |          Length = 20          |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    Key ID     |              (Reserved)                       |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                                                               |
     |                     Auth Key(Checksum)                        |
     |                                                               |
     |                                                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Key ID:  8 bits.  This allows multiple keys to be active
            simultaneously.

   Auth Key:  16 octets.  This field carries the MD5 [RFC1321] checksum
            for the entire traceroute IP/IPv6 packet.  When the Auth Key
            is calculated, the shared MD5 key is stored in this field,
            and the checksum fields in the IP header, UDP header and
            traceroute common header are set to zero.  The result of the
            algorithm is placed in the Auth Key field.

3.2.2.2.  Traceroute Information-Request TLV

   The Information-Request TLV has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |     Type = 2 (Info-Req)       |          Length = 4           |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                       Info Request                            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Info-Req:  32 bits.  This bitflag field lists the request items the
            traceroute sender is interested.  The bit number ranges from
            the right most bit to the left most bit.  Currently defined
            as the following:

              Bit Number Information Item
                   0     MPLS label related attributes
                   1     Interface related attributes
                   2     IP/IPv6 address related attributes
                   3     Routing Instance related attributes


4.  Implementation and Operation Considerations

   There is no change in this extension for the normal traceroute
   implementation and operation except for reserving the lowest 4 bits
   in the UDP source port field.  The implementations for the sender can
   use the same semantics with the UDP source port; and it makes no
   difference to the receivers if they don't support this extension.

4.1.  Traceroute Probe Sender

   The sender supports this extension MAY include the Traceroute
   structure in it's UDP probe to specify the request types and
   authentication key.  The sender SHOULD set the "original length"
   value to 0xF if there is no Traceroute structure present inside the
   UDP probe.  The sender MAY request one or multiple types of
   information defined in the traceroute "Info-Req" TLV.

4.2.  Traceroute Probe Receiver

   When the traceroute probe receiver, the intermediate and destination
   node, processes the UDP probe, it MAY check the UDP Traceroute
   structure to verify if the sender is from an authenticated host and
   to see what types of information it requested.  This check is only
   needed when the receiver tries to authenticate the UDP probe sender,
   or when the receiver is formating the ICMP and ICMPv6s that support
   multi-part messages and it has certain internal information that can
   be included in the ICMP packets.

   If the "original length" value is not 0xF, UDP traceroute structure
   may be present.  The receiver MUST verify the integrity of the data
   structure by examining the "version" field, the Magic-Number value,
   and the length of the structure.  It MUST perform the checksum to
   verify the data structure.  If the authentication TLV is present and
   the local policy requires it to perform the verification, the
   receiver MUST use it's locally stored shared key to validate the
   checksum in the TLV.  Multiple MD5 keys can be used which can be

Internet-Draft          UDP Traceroute Extension           December 2007


   useful in the case the UDP probes are from trusted peer networks.

   If the "Info-Req" TLV is included, the receiver SHOULD fetch the
   related information when formating the ICMP packets, but MUST NOT
   inlcude information that has the corresponding bitflag cleared.


5.  Security Considerations

   This extension enhances the security of traceroute operation in a
   backwards-compatible fashion.  The mechanism allows the receiver to
   verify the sender of the UDP traceroute packet such that certain
   sensitive interface and network related information can be supplied
   in the internal network or across trusted networks.

   MD5 is a strong authentication mechanism since the keys cannot be
   discerned by intercepting the packets.  The proposed Keyed MD5
   authentication does not prevent replay attacks.  However, in the case
   of replay attacks, since the packet source IP/IPv6 address of the
   traceroute probe can not be changed, there is no easy way for the
   attacker to retrieve the ICMP messages.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The UDP Traceroute Extension contains traceroute TLVs.  IANA should
   establish a registry of UDP Traceroute Extension Types.  This
   document defines Type 1 and Type 2 for authentication and
   information-request.  Types 3-0xF6 are allocated through Expert
   Review [RFC2434].  Types 0xF7 to 0xFF are reserved for private use.

   IANA should also establish a registry for UDP Traceroute Info-Request
   Bits.  This document defines bits 0 - 3 in section 3.2.2.2.  Bits
   4-29 are allocated through Expert Review.  Bits 30 - 31 are reserved
   for private use.
