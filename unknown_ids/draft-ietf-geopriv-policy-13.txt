Abstract

   This document defines an authorization policy language for controling
   access to location information.  It extends the Common Policy
   authorization framework to provide location-specific access control.
   More specifically, this document defines location-specific
   transformation elements to reduce the granularity of the returned
   location information.

Internet-Draft             Geolocation Policy               October 2007


1.  Introduction

   Location information needs to be protected against unauthorized
   access to preserve the privacy of humans.  In RFC 3693 [3], a
   protocol-independent model for access to geographic information is
   defined.  The model includes a Location Generator (LG) that
   determines location information, a Location Server (LS) that
   authorizes access to location information, a Location Recipient (LR)
   that requests and receives location information, and a Rule Maker
   (RM) that writes authorization policies.  An authorization policy is
   a set of rules that regulates an entity's activities with respect to
   privacy-sensitive information, such as location information.

   The data object containing location information in the context of
   this document is referred to as a Location Object (LO).  The basic
   rule set defined in the Presence Information Data Format Location
   Object (PIDF-LO) [4] can restrict how long the Location Recipient is
   allowed to retain the information, and it can prohibit further
   distribution.  It also contains a reference to an enhanced rule set
   and a human readable privacy policy.  The basic rule set, however,
   does not allow to control access to location information based on
   specific Location Recipients.  This document describes an enhanced
   rule set that provides richer constraints on the distribution of LOs.

   The rule set allows the entity that uses the rules defined in this
   document to restrict the retention and to enforce access restrictions
   on location data, including prohibiting any dissemination to
   particular individuals, during particular times or when the Target's
   sphere setting contains a particular value.  The RM can also
   stipulate that only certain parts of the Location Object are to be
   distributed to recipients or that the resolution of parts of the
   Location Object is reduced.

   The typical sequence of operations is as follows.  A Location Server
   receives a query for location information from a Watcher for a
   particular Target, via the using protocol [3].  The using protocol
   provides the identity of the requestor, either at the time of the
   query or when subscribing to the location information.  The
   authenticated identity of the Location Recipient, together with other
   information provided by the using protocol or generally available to
   the server, is then used for searching through the rule set.  If more
   than one rule matches the condition element, then the combined
   permission is evaluated according to the description in Section 10 of
   [1].  The result of the rule evalation is applied to the location
   information, yielding a possibly modified Location Object that is
   delivered to the Location Recipient.

   This document does not describe the protocol used to convey location

   information from the Location Server to the Location Recipient (i.e.,
   the using protocol; see RFC 3693 [3]).

   This document extends the Common Policy framework defined in [1].
   That document provides an abstract framework for expressing
   authorization rules.  As specified there, each such rule consists of
   conditions, actions and transformations.  Conditions determine under
   which circumstances the entity executing the rules, for example a
   Location Server, is permitted to apply actions and transformations.
   Transformations regulate in a location information context how a
   Location Server modifies the information elements that are returned
   to the requestor, for example, by reducing the granularity of
   returned location information.

   The XML schema defined in Section 9 extends the Common Policy schema
   by introducing new child elements to the condition and transformation
   elements.  This document does not define child elements for the
   action part of a rule.  When a rule is available then it has the
   semantic of a 'permit' action.  'Deny' actions are not supported by
   this document.  This document furthermore does not specify child
   elements for the condition part of a rule.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

   This document reuses the terminology of RFC 3693 [3], such as
   Location Server (LS), Location Recipient (LR), Rule Maker (RM),
   Target, Location Generator (LG) and Location Object (LO).  This
   document uses the following terminology:

   Presentity or Target:

      RFC 3693 [3] uses the term Target to identify the object or person
      of which location information is required.  The presence model
      described in RFC 2778 [5] uses the term presentity to describe the
      entity that provides presence information to a presence service.
      A Presentity in a presence system is a Target in a location
      information system.


   Watcher or Location Recipient:

      The receiver of location information is the Location Recipient
      (LR) in the terminology of RFC 3693 [3].  A watcher in a presence
      system, i.e., an entity that requests presence information about a
      presentity, is a Location Recipient in a location information
      system.


   Authorization policy:

      An authorization policy is given by a rule set.  A rule set
      contains an unordered list of (policy) rules.  Each rule has a
      condition, an action and a transformation component.


   Permission:

      The term permission refers to the action and transformation
      components of a rule.

   The term 'using protocol' is defined in [3] and refers to the
   protocol that is used to request access to and to return privacy
   sensitive data items.

   In this document we use the term Location Servers as the entities
   that evaluate the geolocation authorization policies.  The

   geolocation privacy architecture is, as motivated in RFC 4079 [6],
   aligned with the presence architecture and a Presence Server is
   therefore an entity that may distribute location information along
   with other presence-specific XML data elements.

3.  Generic Processing

3.1.  Structure of Geolocation Authorization Documents

   A geolocation authorization document is an XML document, formatted
   according to the schema defined in [1].  Geolocation authorization
   documents inherit the MIME type of common policy documents,
   application/auth-policy+xml.  As described in [1], this document is
   composed of rules which contain three parts - conditions, actions,
   and transformations.  Each action or transformation, which is also
   called a permission, has the property of being a positive grant of
   information to the Location Recipient.  As a result, there is a well-
   defined mechanism for combining actions and transformations obtained
   from several sources.  This mechanism is privacy safe, since the lack
   of any action or transformation can only result in less information
   being presented to a Location Recipient.

3.2.  Rule Transport

   There are two ways how the authorization rules described in this
   document may be conveyed between different parties:

   o  RFC 4119 [4] allows enhanced authorization policies to be
      referenced via a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in the 'ruleset-
      reference' element.  The ruleset-reference' element is part of the
      basic rules that always travel with the Location Object.

   o  Authorization policies might, for example, also be stored at a
      Location Server / Presence Server.  The Rule Maker therefore needs
      to use a protocol to create, modify and delete the authorization
      policies defined in this document.  Such a protocol is available
      with the Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access
      Protocol (XCAP) [7].

6.  Transformations

   This document defines several elements that allow Rule Makers to
   specify transformations that

   o  reduce the accuracy of the returned location information, and

   o  set the basic authorization policies carried inside the PIDF-LO.

6.1.  Set Retransmission-Allowed

   This element asks the LS to change or set the value of the
   <retransmission-allowed> element in the PIDF-LO.  The data type of
   the <set-retransmission-allowed> element is a boolean.

   If the value of the <set-retransmission-allowed> element is set to
   TRUE then the <retransmission-allowed> element in the PIDF-LO MUST be
   set to TRUE.  If the value of the <set-retransmission-allowed>
   element is set to FALSE, then the <retransmission-allowed> element in
   the PIDF-LO MUST be set to FALSE.

   If the <set-retransmission-allowed> element is absent then the value
   of the <retransmission-allowed> element in the PIDF-LO MUST be kept
   unchanged or, if the PIDF-LO is created for the first time, then the
   value MUST be set to FALSE.

6.2.  Set Retention-Expiry

   This transformation asks the LS to change or set the value of the
   <retention-expiry> element in the PIDF-LO.  The data type of the
   <set-retention-expiry> element is an integer.

   The value provided with the <set-retention-expiry> element indicates
   seconds and these seconds are added to the current date.

   If the <set-retention-expiry> element is absent then the value of the
   <retention-expiry> element in the PIDF-LO is kept unchanged or, if
   the PIDF-LO is created for the first time, then the value MUST be set
   to the current date.

6.3.  Set Note-Well

   This transformation asks the LS to change or set the value of the
   <note-well> element in the PIDF-LO.  The data type of the <set-note-
   well> element is a string.

   The value provided with the <set-note-well> element contains a
   privacy statement as a human readable text string and an 'xml:lang'



Schulzrinne, et al.       Expires April 4, 2008                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft             Geolocation Policy               October 2007


   attribute denotes the language of the human readable text.

   If the <set-note-well> element is absent, then the value of the
   <note-well> element in the PIDF-LO is kept unchanged or, if the
   PIDF-LO is created for the first time, then no content is provided
   for the <note-well> element.

6.4.  Keep Ruleset Reference

   This transformation allows to influence whether the <external-
   ruleset> element in the PIDF-LO carries the extended authorization
   rules defined in [1].  The data type of the <keep-rule-reference>
   element is Boolean.

   If the value of the <keep-rule-reference> element is set to TRUE,
   then the <external-ruleset> element in the PIDF-LO is kept unchanged
   when included.  If the value of the <keep-rule-reference> element is
   set to FALSE, then the <external-ruleset> element in the PIDF-LO MUST
   NOT contain a reference to an external rule set.  The reference to
   the ruleset is removed and no rules are carried as MIME bodies (in
   case of CID URIs).

   If the <keep-rule-reference> element is absent, then the value of the
   <external-ruleset> element in the PIDF-LO is kept unchanged when
   available or, if the PIDF-LO is created for the first time then the
   <external-ruleset> element MUST NOT be included.

6.5.  Provide Location

   The <provide-location> element contains child elements of a specific
   location profile that controls the granularity of returned location
   information.  This document defines two location profiles, namely:


   o  If the <provide-location> element has a <provide-civic> child
      element then civic location information is disclosed as described
      in Section 6.5.1, subject to availability.


   o  If the <provide-location> element has a <provide-geo> child
      element then geodetic location information is disclosed as
      described in Section 6.5.2, subject to availability.


   The <provide-location> element MUST contain the 'profile' attribute
   if it contains child elements and the 'profile' attribute MUST match
   with the contained child elements.  The <provide-location> element
   MUST contain the 'profile' attribute if it contains child elements.

Internet-Draft             Geolocation Policy               October 2007


   If the <provide-location> element has no child elements then civic,
   as well as, geodetic location information is disclosed without
   reducing its granularity, subject to availability.  In this case the
   profile attribute MUST NOT be included.

6.5.1.  Civic Location Profile

   This profile uses the token 'civic-transformation'.  This profile
   allows civic location transformations to be specified by means of the
   <provide-civic> element that restricts the level of civic location
   information the LS is permitted to disclose.  The symbols of these
   levels are: 'country', 'region', 'city', 'building', 'full'.  Each
   level is given by a set of civic location data items such as
   <country> and <A1>, ..., <POM>, as defined in [8].  Each level
   includes all elements included by the lower levels.

   The 'country' level includes only the <country> element; the 'region'
   level adds the <A1> element; the 'city' level adds the <A2> and <A3>
   elements; the 'building' level and the 'full' level add further civic
   location data as shown below.

   The default value is "none".

   The schema of the <provide-civic> element is defined in Section 8.

6.5.2.  Geodetic Location Profile

   This profile uses the token 'geodetic-transformation' and refers only
   to the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) WGS 84
   (urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326, 2D) and WGS 84
   (urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4979, 3D).  This profile allows geodetic
   location transformations to be specified by means of the <provide-
   geo> element that restricts the resolution of geodetic location
   information based on the value provided in the <latitude-resolution>,
   <longitude-resolution> and <altitude-resolution> child elements of
   the <provide-geo> element.  The resolution is specified as a real
   number r.  Assume that the variable n represents the nominal
   coordinate value (longitude, latitude or altitude), the rounded value
   is computed as

      n'=FLOOR(n*r + 0.5)/r

   Small r values indicate that the granularity of the returned location
   information will be reduced.  The smaller the value r is the larger
   is the granularity reduction.  The value '0' for r is used to
   indicate that location MUST NOT be distributed.  Per default the
   value '0' is assumed.  A large r value indicates that a large amount
   of the available location information will be distributed.  The
   larger the value r is the more precise the returned location
   information is.  The maximum is infinity, the symbol "INF",
   indicating that the available information is disclosed without
   reduction of the granularity.  A value of r=10,000 is sufficiently
   large in order not to reduce the granularity of the returned location
   information.  If r is set to 0.0667 (i.e., 1/r = 15) then a timezone-
   level resolution is provided.

   Next, we show an example where we assume a nominal latitude value of
   n=38.89868.

7.  Examples

   This section provides a few examples for authorization rules using
   the extensions defined in this document.

7.1.  Rule Example with Location-based Transformations

   This example shows the transformations specified in this document.
   The <provide-civic> element indicates that the available civic
   location information is reduced to building level granularity.  If
   geodetic location information is requested then a granularity
   reduction is provided as well.

10.  XCAP Usage

   The following section defines the details necessary for clients to
   manipulate geolocation privacy documents from a server using XCAP.
   If used as part of a presence system, it uses the same AUID as those
   rules.  See [9] for a description of the XCAP usage in context with
   presence authorization rules.

10.1.  Application Unique ID

   XCAP requires application usages to define a unique application usage
   ID (AUID) in either the IETF tree or a vendor tree.  This
   specification defines the "geolocation-policy" AUID within the IETF
   tree, via the IANA registration in Section 11.

10.2.  XML Schema

   XCAP requires application usages to define a schema for their
   documents.  The schema for geolocation authorization documents is
   described in Section 9.

10.3.  Default Namespace

   XCAP requires application usages to define the default namespace for
   their documents.  The default namespace is
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geolocation-policy.

10.4.  MIME Type

   XCAP requires application usages to defined the MIME type for
   documents they carry.  Geolocation privacy authorization documents
   inherit the MIME type of common policy documents, application/
   auth-policy+xml.

10.5.  Validation Constraints

   This specification does not define additional constraints.

10.6.  Data Semantics

   This document discusses the semantics of a geolocation privacy
   authorization.

10.7.  Naming Conventions

   When a Location Server receives a request to access location
   information of some user foo, it will look for all documents within
   http://[xcaproot]/geolocation-policy/users/foo, and use all documents

Internet-Draft             Geolocation Policy               October 2007


   found beneath that point to guide authorization policy.

10.8.  Resource Interdependencies

   This application usage does not define additional resource
   interdependencies.

10.9.  Authorization Policies

   This application usage does not modify the default XCAP authorization
   policy, which is that only a user can read, write or modify his/her
   own documents.  A server can allow privileged users to modify
   documents that they do not own, but the establishment and indication
   of such policies is outside the scope of this document.

   Name of the AUID: geolocation-policy

   Description: Geolocation privacy rules are documents that describe
   the permissions that a Target has granted to Location Recipients that
   access information about his/her geographic location.

12.  Security Considerations

   This document aims to allow Rule Makers to prevent the unintended
   disclosure of location information information to third parties.
   This is accomplished through the usage of transformations that are
   part of rules, see Section 6.  Security requirements are described in
   [3] and a discussion of generic security threats is available with
   [11].  Aspects of combining permissions in cases of multiple
   occurrence are treated in [1]).

   When the Target is moving then the location transformations reveal
   information when switching from one privacy region to another one.
   For example, when a transformation indicates that civic location is
   provided at a 'building' level of granularity.  Hence, room numbers,
   floors etc. would be hidden.  However, when the Target moves from one
   building to the next one then the movement would still be
   recognizable as the disclosed location information would be reflected
   by the new civic location information indicating the new building.
   With additional knowledge about building entrances and streets it
   would be possible to learn a certain amont of information.  It is
   therefore important to ensure that selected privacy regions are not
   chosen too small when mobility is a concern and that a random number
   to is added to the position of the Target, with an absolute value of
   half the privacy region.  The latter aspect is only applicable for
   geodetic information or when geodetic information is translated to
   civic information by the Location Server.
