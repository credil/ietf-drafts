     Indexed File Format for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
                        Common Log Format (CLF)
                draft-salgueiro-sipclf-indexed-ascii-00

Abstract

   The SIPCLF Workgroup has defined a common log format framework for
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) servers.  This common log format
   mimics the wildly successful event logging mechanism found in well-
   known web servers like Apache and web proxies like Squid.  This
   document proposes an indexed text encoding format for the SIP Common
   Log Format (CLF) that retains the key advantages of a text-based
   format, while significantly increasing processing performance over a
   purely text-based implementation.  This file format adheres to the
   SIP CLF data model and provides an effective encoding scheme for all
   mandatory and optional fields that appear in a SIP CLF record.

1.   Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119[1].

   RFC3261[3] defines additional terms used in this document that are
   specific to the SIP domain such as "proxy"; "registrar"; "redirect
   server"; "user agent server" or "UAS"; "user agent client" or "UAC";
   "back-to-back user agent" or "B2BUA"; "dialog"; "transaction";
   "server transaction".

   This document uses the term "SIP Server" that is defined to include
   the following SIP entities: user agent server, registrar, redirect
   server, a SIP proxy in the role of user agent server, and a B2BUA in
   the role of a user agent server.


2.  Introduction

   The extensive list of benefits and the widespread adoption of the
   Apache Common Log Format (CLF) has prompted the development of a
   functionally equivalent event logging mechanism for the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP).  Implementing a logging scheme for SIP is
   a considerable challenge.  This is due in part to the fact that the
   behavior of a SIP entity is more complex as compared to an HTTP
   entity.  Additionally, there are shortcomings to the purely text-
   based HTTP Common Log Format that need to be addressed in order to
   allow for real-time inspection of SIP log files.  Experience with
   Apache Common Log Format has shown that dealing with large quantities
   of log data can be very processor intensive, as doing so necessarily
   requires reading and parsing every byte in the log file(s) of
   interest.

   An implementation independent framework for the SIP CLF has been
   defined [2].  This memo describes an indexed text file format for
   logging SIP messages received and sent by SIP clients, servers, and
   proxies that adheres to the data model presented in Section 8 of
   draft-ietf-sipclf-problem-statement [2].  This document defines a
   format that is no more difficult to generate by logging entities,
   while being radically faster to process.  In particular, the format
   is optimized for both rapidly scanning through log records, as well
   as quickly locating commonly accessed data fields.

   Further, the format proposed by this document retains the key
   advantage of being human readable and able to be processed using the
   various Unix text processing tools, such as sed, awk, perl, cut, and
   grep.

3.  Format

   Each data record is encoded according to the following format.  Note
   that indications of "hexadecimal encoded" indicate that the value is
   to be written out in human-readable base-16 numbers using the ASCII
   characters 0x30 through 0x39 ('0' through '9') and 0x41 through 0x46
   ('A' through 'F').  Similarly, indications of "decimal encoded"
   indicate that the value is to be written out in human readable
   base-10 number using the ASCII characters 0x30 through 0x39 ('0'
   through '9').  In both encodings, numbers always take up the number
   of bytes indicated, and are padded on the left with ASCII '0'
   characters to fill the entire space.

   Version (1 byte):  0x41 for this document; hexadecimal encoded.

   Record Length (6 bytes):  Hexadecimal encoded total length of this
      log record, including "Flags" and "Record Length" fields, and
      terminating line-feed

   Flags Field (3 bytes):

      byte 1 -   Request/Response flag

         R = request
         r = response

      byte 2 -   Retransmission flag

         o = original transmission
         d = duplicate transmission
         s = server is stateless [i.e., retransmissions are not
         detected]

      byte 3 -   Sent/Received flag

         r = message received
         s = message sent

   Bytes 12 through 91 contain hexadecimal encoded pointer/length pairs
   that point to the values of variable-length mandatory fields.  The
   "Pointer" fields indicate absolute byte values within the record, and
   must be >=101.  They point to the start of the corresponding value
   within the "Mandatory Fields" area.  Implementations MUST NOT
   interpret (or dereference) a pointer field whose length field value
   is 0.  A length of 0 implies that the particular field is not present
   in the SIPCLF record.  The final pointer, "TLV Start Pointer," points
   to the ASCII Tab (0x09) character for the first entry in the Tag/
   Length/Value area; if no such entries are present, this value is set
   to zero.

   The "Length" fields indicate the length of the corresponding value.
   Note that the "Length" fields do not include the tab delimiters
   between fields.  Further note that there are no delimiters between
   these pointer/length values -- they are packed together as a single,
   84-character hexadecimal encoded string.

   CSeq:  The CSeq header field.

   R-URI:  The Request-URI in the start line (mandatory in request),
      including any URI parameters.

   Destination:port:xport  The DNS name or IP address of the downstream
      server, including the port number.  The port number must be
      separated from the DNS name or IP address by a single ':'.  The
      transport must be separated from the port by a single ':'.  The
      allowable values for the transport are 'tcp', 'udp', 'sctp', and
      'tls'.

   Source:port:xport  The DNS name or IP address of the upstream client,
      including the port number and the transport over which the SIP
      message was received.  The port number must be separated from the
      DNS name or IP address by a single ':'.  The transport must be
      separated from the port by a single ':'.  The allowable values for
      the transport are 'tcp', 'udp', 'sctp', and 'tls'.

   To:  Value of the To URI header field, including the tag parameter
      (if present).

   From:  Value of the From URI header field, including the tag
      parameter.  Whilst one may question the value of the From URI in
      light of RFC4474 [5], the From URI, nonetheless, imparts some
      information.  For one, the From tag is important and, in the case
      of a REGISTER request, the From URI can provide information on
      whether this was a third-party registration or a first-party one.

   Call-Id:  The value of the Call-ID header field.

   Status:  Set to the value of the SIP response status code for
      responses.  Set to 0 for requests.

   Server-Txn:  Server transaction identification code - the transaction
      identifier associated with the server transaction.
      Implementations can reuse the server transaction identifier (the
      topmost branch-id of the incoming request, with or without the
      magic cookie), or they could generate a unique identification
      string for a server transaction (this identifier needs to be
      locally unique to the server only.)  This identifier is used to
      correlate ACKs and CANCELs to an INVITE transaction; it is also
      used to aid in forking.  (See Section 9 of The Common Log Format
      (CLF) for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2] for usage.)

   Client-Txn:  Client transaction identification code - this field is
      used to associate client transactions with a server transaction
      for forking proxies or B2BUAs.  Upon forking, implementations can
      reuse the value they inserted into the topmost Via header's branch
      parameter, or they can generate a unique identification string for
      the client transaction.  (See Section 9 of The Common Log Format
      (CLF) for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2] for usage.)


   Following the pointer/length pairs, several fixed-length fields are
   encoded.  As before, all fields are completely filled, pre-pending
   values with '0' characters as necessary.


   Timestamp (10 bytes):  Date and time of the request or response
      represented as the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (i.e.
      seconds since midnight, January 1st, 1970, GMT).  Decimal encoded.

   Fractional Seconds (6 bytes):  Fractional seconds portion of the
      Timestamp field to millisecond accuracy.  Decimal encoded.

   Mandatory Field Data:  Contains actual values for the mandatory
      fields.  This data must appear in the order listed, and each field
      must be present.  Fields are separated by a single ASCII Tab
      character (0x09).  Any tab characters present in the data to be
      written will be replaced by an ASCII space character (0x20) prior
      to being logged.



   After the "Mandatory Fields" section, Tag/Length/Value groups appear
   zero or more times.  The location within the log record is indicated
   by the "TLV Start Pointer" field.  They are used to log information
   that is not mandatory for all messages (although specific TLVs are
   mandatory in request logs).



   Tag Field (4 bytes):  indicates the type of value coded by this TLV;
      hexadecimal encoded.  Currently defined tags are:

      0x0000 -  Contact value (can be repeated)
         Contains entire value of Contact header field

      0x0001 -  Remote Host (mandatory in request)
         The DNS name of the IP address from which the message was
         received (if "Sent/Received flag" is set to "r").  The DNS name
         of the IP address to which the message is being sent (if "Sent/
         Received flag" is set to "s")

      0x0002 -  Authenticated User
         Contains the user name by which the user has been authenticated

      0x0003 -  Complete SIP Message (optional, should be omitted by
         default)
         Contains complete SIP message.  Can be repeated multiple times
         to accommodate SIP messages that exceed 65535 bytes in length.


   Length Field (2 bytes):  indicates the length of the value coded in
      this TLV, hexadecimal encoded.  This length does NOT include the
      TLV header.

   Value Field (0 to 65535 bytes):  contains the actual value of this
      TLV.  As with the mandatory fields, ASCII Tab characters (0x09)
      are replaced with ASCII space characters (0x20).

   NOTE: To be filled in later


5.  Text Tool Considerations

   This format has been designed to allow text tools to easily process
   logs without needing to understand the indexing format.  Index lines
   may be rapidly discarded by checking the first character of the line:
   index lines will always start with an alphabetical character, while
   field lines will start with a numerical character.

   Within a field line, script tools can quickly split fields at the tab
   characters.  The first 12 fields are positional, and the meaning of
   any subsequent fields can be determined by checking the first four
   characters of the field.  Alternately, these non-positional fields
   can be located using a regular expression.  For example, the "Contact
   value" in a request can be found by searching for the perl regex
   /\t0000,....,([^\t]*)/.

   Note also that requests can be distinguished from responses by

   checking the third positional field -- for requests, it will always
   be set to "000"; any other value indicates a response.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations
   beyond those in draft-ietf-sipclf-problem-statement [2].


7.  Operational Guidance

   SIP CLF log files will take up substantive amount of disk space
   depending on traffic volume at a processing entity and the amount of
   information being logged.  As such, any enterprise using SIP CLF
   should establish operational procedures for file rollovers as
   appropriate to the needs of the organization.

   Listing such operational guidelines in this document is out of scope
   for this work.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any considerations from IANA.
