   IPv6-only networks, including those that have not deployed stateful
   DHCPv6.  The described stateless approach essentially exchanges the
   complexity of the stateful approach to consumption of IPv6 address
   space and more statical properties.

1.  Introduction

   This documents describes how an automatic and stateless IPv6 Prefix
   Delegation can be realized in some IPv6-only networks.  The consept
   of automatic prefix delegation as described herein builds on what 6RD
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd] has defined for IPv4-networks.

   The 6RD approach uses an IPv4 address and service provider's own IPv6
   address prefix to calculate delegated IPv6 prefixes.  This document
   describes how the IPv4 address required for the 6RD's calculation can
   be replaced with unique bits from other information sources, such as
   from unique /64 prefix allocated to a host.  This makes it possible
   to calculate the delegated, shorter than /64, prefixes from learned
   service provider's IPv6 prefix and from IPv6-specific unique data
   source.  The described improvement allows automatic delegation
   without any dependency to IPv4.

   As this solution is for IPv6-enabled networks, no IP-in-IP
   encapsulation is required.  Due to stateless nature, this approach
   enables prefix delegation without mandating deployment of stateful
   DHCPv6 servers or AAA involvement.  When the mechanism is used in
   deployments such 3GPP, IPv6 routing remains static and does not
   require dynamic updates (see figure 1).

   The described stateless solution is an alternative for stateful
   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6 PD) described in RFC3633 [RFC3633].
   The calculated prefixes are used similarly to how prefixes delegated
   with DHCPv6 PD would be used, except that lifetime of these prefixes
   are bound to the lifetime of the used source of information (e.g. the
   /64-bit prefix of host's WAN interface).

   In IETF's history there have been other proposals for simpler prefix
   delegation, such as IPv6 Router Advertisement Prefix Delegation
   Option [I-D.lutchann-ipv6-delegate-option] that proposed new option
   for Router Advertisement sent by service provider router towards site
   router, and Automatic Prefix Delegation Protocol for Internet
   Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) [I-D.haberman-ipngwg-auto-prefix] that
   proposed ICMPv6 based request and reply protocol.  The DHCPv6 PD, RA-
   based, and ICMPV6-based solutions all describe explicit delegation of
   prefixes, while 6RD and this document propose algorithmic prefix
   delegation.

2.  Protocol overall description

   The 6RD technology uses globally or locally unique IPv4 address in
   building of 6RD delegated prefixes.  This document expands on that
   and documents how other sources of unique information, which has to
   be known by both a host and a network, can be similarly used to
   calculated automatically delegated prefixes.

   The sources of suitable uniqueness covered in this memo are:

   Unique /64 prefixes:  In certain network architectures, such as
      3GPP's and WiMAX Forum's, each point-to-point link has unique /64
      bit prefix, from where unique bits can be fetched for prefix
      calculation.

   IPv4 address:  The 6RD uses IPv4 address as part of the prefix
      delegation, but that approach has dependency to IPv4.
      Nevertheless, if (locally) unique IPv4 address is available, such
      as in dual-stack network accesses, it can be used.

   Interface Identifier:  The IIDs used by hosts on a given link are
      always unique, and in case of PPP can also be unique over set of
      links (e.g. unique over PPP links terminated by the same box).

   DHCPv6:  A host may have been allocated IPv6 address statefully.  In
      that case it is possible to use that IPv6 address as a source of
      uniqueness.

   The chapter "Provisioning of hosts" describes options that network
   can use to instruct the host with the source of unique bits it should
   use.

2.1.  Unique /64-bit prefixes

   In certain point-to-point network architectures host is configured
   with unique /64-bit prefix.  Best examples of such networks are 3GPP
   and WiMAX.

   As a host has unique /64-bit prefix, it can use lowest bits of the
   prefix in conjuction with service provider configured common prefix.
   Essentially, a host can build delegated prefix similarly to 6RD, but
   use the unique IPv6 prefix bits instead of an IPv4 address.

   The lifetime of delegated prefixes are bound to lifetime of the
   unique /64 bit prefix, which usually is bound to lifetime of layer 2
   connection between the host and the network.  If the host has static
   /64 prefix, i.e. host receives same /64 prefix in subsequent layer 2
   connection establishments to the same network, then the delegated

   prefixes remain valid over reconnections (unless service provider's
   common prefix changes).

   The host behaviour is as follows.  Note that host 1 of figure 1 does
   only the step one, while hosts 2 and 3 do also steps 2-4:

   1.  Host receives unique /64-bit prefix on its WAN interface (e.g.
       3GPP) as currently.

   2.  Host asks for service provider common prefix via DHCPv6
       Information Request.

   3.  Host combines lowest bits of /64 prefix with common prefix, and
       learns the prefix it has been delegated (PrefD2, PrefD3).

   4.  Host becomes a router and starts to advertise /64 subnet
       prefix(es) selected from the delegated prefix on local area
       network(s), or further delegates them (PrefD2-1, PrefD3-1&2).

   The network behaviour is as follows:

   1.  Allocate service provider common prefix for stateless IPv6 Prefix
       Delegation use

   2.  When a host connects, gateway allocates /64 prefix for the point-
       to-point link as currently.

   3.  After the allocation of /64, network calculates delegated
       prefixes for newly connected host, and updates routing tables
       accordingly.  This happens for all hosts 1-3 of figure 1.  The
       gateway cannot know which of the hosts are going to use delegated
       prefixes, as the delegation is stateless.

   4.  As the delegated prefixes can be calculated based on the
       allocated /64 prefix and service provider common prefix,
       accounting and authorization functions can identify to which
       subscriber different data flows belong.

   The following figure 1 illustrates the setup on a network using
   point-to-point links (such as PPP):

           Figure 1: Stateless PD on point-to-point architecture

   On the figure 1, from Internet point of view, all packets destined to
   /64 prefixes used on hosts' WAN interface, or to the service
   provider's common prefix, are routed to the gateway.  Therefore no
   dynamic IPv6 routing changes are required.  It is only the gateway
   that has routing table configured to route packets towards correct
   hosts.

   Firewall functionality is not illustrated, as that should not differ
   from ordinary DHCPv6-based prefix delegation architecture.

2.2.  IPv4 address

   This approach is the same as 6RD, except that encapsulation is not
   needed if a host is provided with dual-stack network connectivity.
   The IPv4 address can be globally or locally unique.  The used link
   type may be shared or point-to-point.

2.3.  Interface identifier

   IPv6 over PPP [RFC5072] defines negotiation method for Interface
   Identifier (IID) for PPP connections, and mentions that IID may also
   be unique over larger scope than single PPP link.  The IPv6CP
   provides means for the PPP "server", i.e. the gateway, to dictate and
   know what Interface Identifier the host side of PPP link configures
   for itself.  Similar thing is possible in 3GPP networks as well,
   where the network always configures one Interface Identifier for a
   host to help optimize Duplicate Address Detection procedures.  A
   network that controls hosts IID selection can ensure all hosts have
   unique IID (on gateway's scope), and thus this IID can be used in
   building of the statelessly delegated IPv6 prefixes.  On multicast
   capable links unique IIDs (such as those based on MAC-addresses)
   might be used as component for delegated prefix calculation (?).

Internet-Draft                Stateless PD                  October 2009


   When IIDs are used, the setup is very similar to that of figure 1,
   except that instead of binding /64 prefix to delegated prefixes,
   gateway binds allocated interface identifiers to delegated prefixes.
   This enables renumbering for the WAN interface, as long as IID is not
   changed in the process.

2.4.  DHCPv6

   When the host is allocated IPv6 address statefully with DHCPv6, it is
   possible to use that address as source of uniqueness for stateless
   delegated prefix calculation in case network administrator for some
   reason does not want to use stateful DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation.
   [RFC3633]

   If a DHCPv6 server, or a DHCPv6 proxy, locates at the first hop
   entity from the host point of view, routing table management is
   similar to /64 prefix case.  The entry is created by combining
   service provider prefix and relevant bits from the allocated IPv6
   address.  (Q:Does tthe same work with DHCPv6 relay?)

2.5.  Layer 2 identifier

   On some deployments gateway can efficiently differentiate hosts based
   on layer 2 identifiers, such as GPRS Tunneling Protocol tunnel
   endpoint identifier (GTP TEID).  In such cases, it may be desirable
   to build delegated prefixes based on layer 2 identifier; the gateway
   can then forward traffic based on the layer 2 identifier embedded
   within IPv6 address rather than by IPv6 address itself.

2.6.  Multiple uplink interfaces

   A mobile node may be attached to multiple uplink WAN connections
   simultaneously, in which case it may statelessly receive delegated
   prefixes from more than one network interface.  In such case the host
   can choose which, or all, of the delegated prefixes it advertises on
   the local area network(s).  When new upstream connections are opened
   and statelessly delegated prefixes calculated, the host may add new
   prefixes to router advertisements it is sending locally.  When
   upstream connection(s) are lost beyond recovery (e.g. if re-
   establishment fails), the host must send router advertisement with
   preferred and valid lifetime of zero to local area network for those
   prefixes that no longer can be routed.

2.7.  Interaction with IP mobility

   The /64 prefix, or single IPv6 address, may have been allocated by
   the PMIP6 [RFC5213] Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) or (DS)MIP6 Home
   Agent [RFC3775][RFC5555].  In such case network or host based

Internet-Draft                Stateless PD                  October 2009


   mobility is provided also for the statelessly delegated prefixes.
   The service provider's common prefix MUST be configured for each of
   host's new prefix/IPv6 address individually.  This makes it possible
   for administrator to control on which interfaces stateless prefix
   delegation is possible.

2.8.  Advertised prefix lifetimes

   The lifetimes for the advertised prefixes depends on the source of
   information used on prefix calculation.

   In the case of IPv6 prefix, IPv6 address, or IPv4 address, the
   advertised prefix lifetime is to be equal or shorter than the
   lifetime of the source.

   In the case of IID or layer 2 identifier, the advertised prefix
   lifetime may be bound to those, i.e. be valid as long as the link is
   up.  To enable network renumbering in case of long lived connections,
   the host MUST recheck validity of the service provider prefix daily
   or in apparent route failure (e.g. determined based on received
   ICMPv6 error messages).


3.  Provisioning of hosts

   The host provisioning happens similarly to 6RD, both DHCPv6 and and
   IPCPv6 can be used.

   The configuration option looks as below.  The validity time of the
   delegated prefixes depend both on the source of unique information
   and validity of service provider's IPv6 prefix.

                          /64 bit prefix allocated on the point-to-point
                          link.
                       I: The host MUST use the lowest bits of the
                          Interace Identifier negotiated for the link

4.  Delegated Prefix calculation

   The calculation of delegated prefix requires the service provider
   prefix and bits from the unique information source.  The address

   format is as follows:


        /n            +    n     +    n      +      64       = 128 bits
    +-----------------+----------+-----------+-------------------------+
    | SPD-prefix      | V6UNIQUE | Subnet ID |      Interface ID       |
    +-----------------+----------+-----------+-------------------------+
    |<--- Calculated Prefix  --->|<--- Addresses available for host--->|

     SPD-prefix  The Service Provider's prefix for automatic prefix
                 delegation

     V6UNIQUE    The bits from the unique source, e.g. bottom part of
                 the /64 prefix of host's WAN interface. The maximum
                 length is limited by SPD-prefix length and number of
                 subnets each subscriber is to be provided with.

     Subnet ID   The size of the delegated address space for the host.


5.  Verification of delegated prefixes

   The stateless prefix delegation is an implicit rather than an
   explicit procedure.  The stateless delegation may also be used in
   much more dynamic and less managed deployments than DHCPv6-based
   prefix delegation.  To ensure there are no configuration errors and
   that the delegated prefixes are successfully handled by all involved
   entities and possible middleboxes, a host MAY do a connectivity test
   by sending few ICMPv6 Echo Requests from randomly selected source
   addresses of the delegated IPv6 address space, and based on received
   replies determine if the delegation has been successful.  This helps
   to avoid advertisement of non-functional prefixes to local area
   networks, and may also help host to fallback to other network
   connection sharing solutions such as DHCPv6 PD or Neighbor Discovery
   Proxy [RFC4389].


6.  Numbering examples

   Here are few examples of different numbering schemes.

6.1.  Example 1

   16.78 million customers and 256 subnets per subscriber.

   * The V6UNIQUE length has to be 24 bits

   * Subnet ID length has to be 8 bits

   Thus SPD-prefix of length /32 is enough.

6.2.  Example 2

   1 million subscribers and 16 subnets per subscriber.

   * V6UNIQUE length has to be 20 bits

   * Subnet ID length has to be 4 bits

   Thus SPD-prefix of /40 is enough.

6.3.  Example 3

   536 million subscribers and 8 subnets per subscriber.

   * V6UNIQUE length has to be 29 bits

   * Subnet ID length has to be 3 bits

   Thus SPD-prefix of /32 is enough.

6.4.  Example 4

   16.78 million customers and 4 subnets per subscriber.

   * V6UNIQUE length has to be 24 bits

   * Subnet ID lenght has to be 2 bits

   Thus SPD-prefix of /38 is enough.


7.  Conclusions

   Feedback requested.

   There are plenty of IPv6 addresses and large number of customers can
   be satisfied with reasonably long delegated prefixes.  With stateless
   delegation signaling for prefix delegation purposes between
   (unmanaged) customer equipment and operator's DHCPv6 servers can be
   avoided.  Operator remains in control of prefix delegation by not
   providing service provider prefix on request and enforcing
   communications with firewalls.
