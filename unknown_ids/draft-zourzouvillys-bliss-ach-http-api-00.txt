Internet-Draft      Basic HTTP API interface for ACH          March 2009


1.  Introduction

   There are many situations in which a SIP phone (or user agent acting
   on behalf of a user) would like to have a way to programatically
   request the network perform actions on behalf of the user.  For
   example, when a SIP phone is configured to forward all calls, it
   should be able to configure the network to provide this service
   rather than rely on the phone sending a 300-class response, as this
   would not work if the phone is offline.

   It is common for SIP service providers to provide this feature for
   network configuration via a web interface, however a standardised API
   for changing this configuratio nsetting would be benificial for end
   users.

   The mechanism defined in this specification allows a client to make
   simple HTTP requests to a server to query and modify network provided
   settings.

1.1.  Relationship to XCAP

   XCAP was not chosen for remote configuration.  Due to additional
   requirements, a simple approach became very complex, perfect suited
   to modify XML documents and parts of it.  But for our purpose, this
   is not really necessary.  For this draft, a simple RESTful approach
   has been taken.  Nevertheless valuable ideas, for example the XCAP
   URI structure, have been adopted.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Scope

   This document is limited to a subset of network provided features and
   does not support more complex operations such as time-of-day routing.
   The following features have been identified by the BLISS REST design
   team to be provided in the first version of this protocol:

   (1)  Call forwarding unconditional (all calls), on busy, no answer,
        or not reachable: either to voicemail or to any other number or
        URI.

   (2)  Barring on all or certian classes of outgoing calls
   (3)  Barring on all or anonymous incoming calls.
   (4)  Enabling/Disabling call forwarding or DND.


4.  Protocol Model

   The client is configured with a base API HTTP URL for the server.
   This document does not define any mechanisms for discovering a base
   API URL, and could be the subject of further study.  Examples of
   mechanisms for discovering the base API URI could be through static
   configuration, by including a URI in a REGISTER response or through
   the UA configuration framework.

   The configuration model defined in this document is outlined as a
   tree below.  Each node is represented as a path in the HTTP URL that
   is formed by starting with the base API URI, and then appending each
   of the nodes with a '/' seperating them.

4.1.  Example

   Example base API URL: <https://api.example.com/alice>

   The path for DND status would be:
   https://api.example.com/alice/ach/dnd/status


5.  General HTTP requirements

5.1.  Server requirements

   The HTTP server that implements this API MUST support HTTP/1.1.

   If the server does not support any of the network services, it should
   return 404 for any of the nodes relevant to that service.

5.2.  Client requirements

   Any client accessing this API MUST support HTTP/1.1, and HTTP Digest
   authentication.

5.3.  Cookies

   The server MUST NOT rely on cookie support being provided by the HTTP
   user agent.

   The client SHOULD NOT send any cookies, even if previously set by the
   server.


6.  Configuration Scope

   All configuration settings defined in this document apply to the AOR
   scope.  In other words, a setting is applied to requests as they are
   received at an AOR rather than for each binding within the AOR.

   This has the implication that any configuration change will apply to
   all bindings within the AOR.  If 2 SIP devices are registered against
   an AOR, enabling call forward on one will also apply to the other.

   Future work may introduce other scopes that settings can be applied
   at; for example, a specific instance binding rather than than the
   whole AOR.

7.  Call forwarding

   The call forwarding setting requests that the SIP proxy forwards all
   calls received for the given AOR to the instead be forwarded to the
   target URI configured.

7.1.  Classes

   There are 3 classes of call forwarding.  This document defines the
   following classes:

   OPEN-ISSUE: There is a difference between "unconditional call
   forwarding" vs "call forward no answer". timeout = 0 could be the
   differentiator, but there have been questiosn raised in the design
   team regarding this.

   (1)  all
   (2)  busy
   (3)  unreachable

   OPEN-ISSUE: These need precedence for the case of multiple matches;
   Which take priority? (the above seems to make sense to me)

7.1.1.  all

   This class applies at all times, and is also commonly known as
   "unconditional call forwarding".

7.1.2.  unreachable

   This class applies when this AOR is unreachable, which could be
   either due to no bindings being available, or each of them has
   returned a failure response.

   OPEN-ISSUE: does this apply to 3xx?

7.1.3.  busy

   This class applies when bindings are available, but each returned a
   486 or 600 response code.

7.2.  Settings

   Within each class, there are 2 configuration settings:

   (1)  target
   (2)  status

7.2.1.  target

   Content-Type: text/plain

   This setting, which must be a valid URI, is the target of the new SIP
   request when the class in which it is set is enabled and the request
   matches.

   OPEN-ISSUE: The content-type really should be something else - for
   example text/uri, except it doesn't exist!

7.2.2.  status

   Content-Type: text/plain

   This setting must be a value of either 'enabled' or 'disabled', and
   indicates if the class in which this setting is in is either enabled
   or disabled.

7.2.3.  timeout

   Content-Type: text/plain

   This setting is the number of seconds which must pass since the
   request is original received before any outstanding branches are
   CANCELled and the request forked to the URI in the 'target' setting.

7.3.  Example

7.3.1.  Querying status of unconditional call forwarding


   F1 Alice -> HTTP Server

   GET /alice/ach/forwarding/all/status HTTP/1.1
   Host: ach.api.example.com



   F2 HTTP Server -> Alice

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/plain

   enabled

Internet-Draft      Basic HTTP API interface for ACH          March 2009


7.3.2.  Enable unconditional call forwarding

   In this example, unconditional call forward is enabled for an AOR
   with the API root of 'https://ach.api.example.com/ach/alice'.


   PUT /ach/alice/service/forward/all/target HTTP/1.1
   Host: ach.api.example.com
   Content-Type: text/plain

   tel:+441908764181



   PUT /ach/alice/service/forward/all/status HTTP/1.1
   Host: api.example.com
   Content-Type: text/plain

   enabled


8.  Incoming Call Barring

   OPEN-ISSUE: perhaps add CPC baring?

8.1.  Anonymous Calls

   TODO: document


9.  Outgoing Call Barring

   Setting outgoing call barring is useful for example to restrict users
   of the phone from making a certian class of call by mistake, i.e
   premium rate numbers.  The network may also be configurable to lock
   down the ability to change this setting.

   TODO: document


10.  Do Not Disturb (DND)

   ISSUE: DND could be achived by defining some service URNs that return
   the status code, for example 480. e.g: urn:sip:status:unavailable,
   and then setting unconditional call forward to it, for example?

   TODO: document

Internet-Draft      Basic HTTP API interface for ACH          March 2009


11.  Monitoring of changes

   OPEN-ISSUE: should we reference draft-roach-sip-http-subscribe-01 for
   monitoring of settings?


12.  Security Considerations

   TODO: add text on outgoing call barring security.

   TODO: add other secuirty considerations
