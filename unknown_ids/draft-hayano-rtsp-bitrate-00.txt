Abstract

   Typically, there is no use for providing bandwidth information from
   an RTSP 2.0 server to RTSP 2.0 clients.  The bandwidth of the medias
   played out by the server is different from the available bandwidth in
   the network (which is also changing) and there is anyhow the need to
   perform congestion control during media playout.  This is true for
   Internet deployments, or similar, but conveying information about
   bandwidth of the medias can be required in other deployments of RTSP
   2.0.  It might necessarily for RTSP 2.0 clients to obtain information
   about the by medias used bandwidth in networks that rely on bandwidth
   reservation initiated by the end host.  An example is the Next
   Generation Network (NGN) standardized by ETSI TISPAN, where RTSP 2.0
   clients must indicate the required bandwidth to the network.  This
   memo discusses how to provide bandwidth information from RTSP 2.0
   servers to clients and how to introduce it in RTSP 2.0.

Internet-Draft            Bitrate Notification                March 2009


1.  Introduction

   Typically, there is no use for providing bandwidth information from
   an RTSP 2.0 server to RTSP 2.0 clients.  The bandwidth of the medias
   played out by the server is different from the available bandwidth in
   the network (which is also changing) and there is anyhow the need to
   perform congestion control during media playout.  This is true for
   Internet deployments, or similar, but conveying information about
   bandwidth of the medias can be required in other deployments of RTSP
   2.0.  It might necessarily for RTSP 2.0 clients to obtain information
   about the by medias used bandwidth in networks that rely on bandwidth
   reservation initiated by the end host.  An example is the Next
   Generation Network (NGN) standardized by ETSI TISPAN [ETSI-183-063],
   where RTSP 2.0 clients must indicate the required bandwidth to the
   network.  This memo discusses how to provide bandwidth information
   from RTSP 2.0 servers to clients and how to introduce it in RTSP 2.0.

   Some IPTV deployments that are using the Real Time Streaming Protocol
   (RTSP) require the ability of the server to notify clients about the
   used bitrate occurring during an RTSP session.  This information can
   be send at the start of a session or during an already established
   session.  However, past discussions in the MMUSIC WG concluded that a
   bitrate notification from the server to client is of no use, as:

   o  the streaming server and RTSP server can be separated, so that the
      RTSP server does not have any knowledge about the bitrate;

   o  the bitrate sent at the server is not necessary the same as the
      client receives, as there might be cases when parts of the stream
      get lost in the network (e.g., congestion or not enough bandwidth
      anyhow due to low bandwidth links;

   o  a bitrate does not release the client/server from performing
      congestion control on the media streams (see Section C.3.
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis] for similar initial considerations).

   There is no means right now in RTSP 2.0 to tell clients about the
   used bandwidth.  The remainder of this document discusses same state
   of the art in the space of RTSP 1.0 with respect to bitrate
   notification in Section 1.1.  Section 2 describes the intended use
   case and Section 3 sketches an early solution.

1.1.  Current Implementations

   To our knowledge there is at least one implementation of the bitrate
   header.  The Hikari Service Architecture (HSA), which is using RTSP
   1.0 [RFC2326] , defines bitrate parameter in Transport header.  It
   can notify a client of a bitrate of contents from a server by the

   response of SETUP.  This specification is implemented by HSA RTSP
   vendors.  HSA was developed by the Hikari Service Architecture
   Consortium (HSAC, [HSAC]) in Japan.  NB: The consortium itself was
   closed, as the service specification was completed, and the
   specification is currently used.

   There are also standards bodies working on bitrate notifications from
   server to clients in RTSP.  For instance, ETSI TISPAN method 2-2
   ([ETSI-183-063]) is using the message body (SDP) in the response of
   DESCRIBE to notify the client about the bitrate.

2.  Use Case

   There is a use case when bitrate notification is beneficial.  In
   certain deployments, clients have to tell the network the required
   bandwidth via a resource reservation (e.g., ETSI TISPAN NGN
   [ETSI-183-063]).  In this case, RTSP servers cannot are not able to
   tell the required bandwidth to the network, but the client can.
   Therefore, there is the need to notify the clients about the required
   bandwidth.  However, this holds only true for the described case and
   does not apply to the general Internet use case.

   This notification can be required on startup and during a session.
   An example for changing of bandwidth during a session is the use of
   playlists.  The bandwidth of each entry in a play list might be
   different and the client should be able to make a bandwidth
   reservation according to the bitrate of the particular content to
   improve the use efficiency in a network bandwidth.  A play list
   could, for instance, consist out of:

   o  A movie with 6 MBit per second, interrupted by

   o  advertisements with 12 MBit per second, and so on.

Internet-Draft            Bitrate Notification                March 2009


3.  Solution Proposal

   The bitrate is a property of the media delivered and so it seem
   natural to include the information about the bitrate in the media-
   property header. (see Section 16.29 [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis]).
   The media-property header can be included in the response to SETUP
   and in PLAY_NOTIFY and thus fulfills the need of getting bandwidth
   information delivered from a server to client at the appropriate
   time.

   Adding bitrate field to media-properties requires a change of the
   syntax by using the media-prob-ext (taken from
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis]):

    Media-Properties = "Media-Properties" HCOLON media-prop-list
    media-prop-list  = media-prop-value *(COMMA media-prop-value)
    media-prop-value = ("Random-Access" [EQUAL POS-FLOAT])
                     / "Begining-Only"
                     / "No-Seeking"
                     / "Unmutable"
                     / "Dynamic"
                     / "Time-Progressing"
                     / "Unlimited"
                     / ("Time-Limited" EQUAL utc-range-spec)
                     / ("Time-Duration" EQUAL POS-FLOAT)
                     / media-prop-ext
    media-prop-ext   = token [EQUAL (1*rtsp-unreserved / quoted-string)]

   The media-prob-ext is extended this way to carry the bitrate.  The
   bitrate is measured in bits per second:

   ("Bitrate" EQUAL POS-FLOAT)

   NOTE WELL: However, it should be noted that this Bitrate media
   property can be used in limited deployment scenarios and cannot be
   used in the open Internet!

4.  Usage Example

   This section is showing one possible usage example for bitrate.  The
   example combines the usage in response messages and also for
   PLAY_NOTIFY.  Note that (*1) and (*2) link to a later explanation.

   *1:RTSP server sends 200OK response of SETUP that includes Media-
   Properties header.  This Media-Properties header includes Bitrate
   parameter to notify bitrate of contents.  Here is the message content
   sent from the server to the client marked (*1):

5.  Security Considerations

   This initial version of this memo does not yet have any security
   considerations, but they will be added with the next revision.

6.  Conclusion

   This memo is work in progress and is requesting feedback from the
   MMUSIC working group.

   However, it should be noted well that using the bitrate header is
   limited to controlled environments only (see also see Section C.3. of
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis]), as notification of bitrate from a
   server to a client does usually not have real meaning (see also
   Section 1).
