    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a pseudowire that is used to transport a
      packet service over an MPLS PSN is the case where the client LSR and the
      server PE are co-resident in the same equipment. For correct operation
      these clients require a multi-protocol interface with fate sharing
      between the client protocol suite. The packet pseudowire may be used to
      carry all of the required layer 2 and layer 3 protocols between the pair
      of client LSRs.</t>

    <section title="Introduction ">
      <t>There is a need to provide a method of carrying a packet service over
      an MPLS PSN in a way that provides isolation between the two networks.
      The server MPLS network may be a "classic" MPLS network or an MPLS-TP
      network <xref target="RFC5317"></xref>. The client may also be either a
      "classic" MPLS network of an MPLS-TP network. Considerations as to
      whether an MPLS "classic" network can act as a server for an MPLS-TP
      network are outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>Where the client equipment is connected to the server equipment via
      physical interface, the same data-link type MUST be to attach the
      clients to the PEs, and a pseudowire of the same type as the data-link
      MUST be used <xref target="RFC3985"></xref>. The reason that
      inter-working between different physical and data-link attachment types
      is specifically disallowed in the pseudowire architecture is because
      this is a complex task and not a simple bit-mapping exercise. The
      inter-working is not limited to the physical and data-link interfaces
      and state-machines it also requires a compatible approach to the
      formation of the adjacencies between attached client network equipment.
      As an example the reader should consider the differences between router
      adjacency formation on a point to point link compared to a multi-point
      to multi-point interface (e.g. Ethernet).</t>

      <t>A further consideration is that two adjacent MPLS LSRs do not simply
      exchange MPLS packets. They exchange IP packets for adjacency formation,
      control, routing, label exchange, management and monitoring purposes. In
      addition they may exchange data-link packets as part of routing (e.g.
      IS-IS hellos and IS-IS LSPs) and for OAM purposes (e.g. Cisco Discovery
      Protocol). Thus the two clients require an attachment mechanism that can
      be used to multiplex a number of protocols. In addition it is essential
      to the correct operation of the network layer that all of these
      protocols fate share.</t>

      <t>Where the client LSRs and server PEs are co-located in the same
      equipment the data-link layer can be simplified to a simple protocol
      identifier (PID) that is used to multiplex the various data-link types
      onto a pseudowire. This is the method that described in this
      document.</t>

      <t>In this model LSRs, LSR1 and LSR2, are part of the client MPLS packet
      switched network (PSN). The PEs, PE1 and PE2 are part of the server PSN,
      that is to be used to provide connectivity between the client LSRs. The
      attachment circuit that is used to connect the MPLS LSRs to the PEs is a
      virtual interface within the equipment. A packet pseudowire is used to
      provide connectivity between these virtual interfaces. This packet
      pseudowire is used to transport all of the required layer 2 and layer 3
      between protocols between LSR1 and LSR2.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Packet Pseudowire Control Word">
      <t>This section describes the encapsulation of a packet pseudowire. The
      packet pseudowire always uses the control word. The control word
      consists of two components: the preferred pseudowire MPLS control word
      <xref target="RFC4385"></xref>, immediately followed by a PPP data link
      layer (DLL) protocol number <xref target="RFC1661"></xref>. The 16 bit
      format of the PPP DLL protocol number MUST be used.</t>

      <t>The MPLS pseudowire control word is shown in <xref
      target="PKT-PW-CW"></xref>. Definitions of the fragmentation (FRG),
      length and sequence number fields are to be found in <xref
      target="RFC4385"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Note that the PPP link control protocol is not used.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Status Indication">
      <t>A pseudowire status indicating a fault can be considered equivalent
      to interface down and SHOULD be passed across the virtual interface to
      the loacl LSR. This improves scaling in PE with large numbers of
      c-resident LSRs and with LSRs that have large numbers of interfaces
      mapped to pseudowires.</t>

      <t>The mechanism described for the mapping of pseudowire status to the
      virtual interface state that are described in <xref
      target="RFC4447"></xref> and in section 10 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw"></xref> apply to the packet
      pseudowire. Pseudowire status messages indicating pseudowire or remote
      virtual interface faults MUST be mapped to a fault indication on the
      local virtual interface.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Congestion Considerations ">
      <t>This pseudowire is being used to carry MPLS and its associated
      support protocols over an MPLS network. There are no congestion
      considerations beyond those that ordinarily apply to an MPLS
      network.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The packet pseudowire provides no means of protecting the contents or
      delivery of the pseudowire packets on behalf of the client packet
      service. The packet pseudowire may, however, leverage security
      mechanisms provided by the MPLS Tunnel Layer. A more detailed discussion
      of pseudowire security is given in <xref target="RFC3985"></xref>, <xref
      target="RFC4447"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3916"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations ">
      <t>IANA are requested to allocate a new pseudowire type for packet
      pseudowire in the MPLS Pseudowire Types Registry. The next available
      value is requested.</t>
