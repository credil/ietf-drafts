             RTCP Report Extension for Feedback Suppression
             draft-wu-avt-retransmission-supression-rtp-03

Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to the RTCP feedback messages
   defined in the Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF).  This
   extension allows an intermediate node in the network (such as an RTP
   translator) inform downstream receivers that sending a feedback
   message concerning a specified set of RTP messages may be
   unnecessary, or even harmful.  For example, in a source-specific
   multicast session with large fan-out, packet loss close to the media
   or distribution source of the session is detected as a loss by a
   large number of receivers.  The RTCP NACK messages used to request
   retransmission of the missing packets are all addressed to the media
   sender, or a designated feedback target.  This may result in a
   phenomenon known variously as a "NACK implosion" or "feedback storm".
   The Feedback Suppression message defined herein is used to notify
   receivers that packet loss was detected and that the sender of the
   report will either proactively recover, or no recovery is possible.
   Receivers respond to receipt of a feedback suppression message by not
   sending a feedback message (e.g. a NACK) that they otherwise would,
   This in turn reduces load on both the feedback target and on the
   network.  This document registers two new RTCP messages for Feedback
   Suppression.

Internet-Draft            Feedback Suppression              October 2010


1.  Introduction

   RTCP feedback messages [RFC4585]allow the receivers in an RTP session
   to report events and ask for action from the sender (or a delegated
   feedback target).  There are cases where multiple receivers may
   initiate the same, or an equivalent message towards the same sender.
   When the receiver count is large, this behavior may overload the
   sender or the network or both.  One common case is receivers
   utilizing RTP retransmission as a packet loss recovery technique in a
   real-time application such as streaming video or
   audio.[RFC4588]Feedback is accomplished using the RTCP NACK message
   which conveys the RTP sequence number(s) of the lost packet(s).  This
   information can then be used by the sender to retransmit the missing
   RTP packets using the RTP retransmission payload format[RFC4585].

   However, in topologies utilizing transport translators (Topo-Trn-
   Translator) or large-scale multicast transmission (Topo-Multicast) as
   defined in [RFC5117], packet loss can occur on either an upstream
   link or a downstream aggregate link of the intermediate network
   element (e.g., Retransmission server, Distribution Source).  Where
   there are many receivers, this may result in a NACK implosion towards
   the sender, i.e., large number of NACK requests to the same multicast
   sender for retransmission of the same RTP packets.  This phenomenon
   goes by a number of alternate names, such as the "NACK storm"
   terminology of [DVB-IPTV].  In an attempt to increase its robustness
   against the loss of a NACK message or of retransmission packets, a
   receiver may send multiple NACKs for the same detected packet loss,
   which may aggravate the NACK implosion.

   Another use case involves video Fast Update requests.  A storm of
   these feedback messages can occur in conversational multimedia
   scenarios like Topo-Video-switch-MCU [RFC5117].  In this scenario,
   packet loss may happen on an upstream link of an intermediate network
   element such as a Multipoint Control Unit(MCU).  Receivers missing
   the packets issue fast update requests (i.e., Full Intra Request(FIR)
   described in [RFC5104]), which results in an implosion of FIR
   requests from receivers to the same media sender.

   As these feedback storms propagate (e.g., NACK implosion or Fast
   update implosion), the network may be permeated with more and more
   feedback traffic, resulting in a positive feedback loop as the
   network is also saturated with media traffic.  RTCP feedback storms
   pose a substantial risk of increasing network congestion, and in
   extreme cases to congestion collapse on the control channel (e.g.
   RTCP feedback), the data channel (i.e.  RTP restransmission), or
   both.

   In order to mitigate these behaviors, the current text in [RFC5760]

Internet-Draft            Feedback Suppression              October 2010


   allows the distribution source to filter out the NACK messages and
   [DVB-IPTV] suggests sending a NACK message from sender to the
   receiver.  However NACK is defined as a receiver report sent from a
   receiver to the sender and therefore exhibits a semantic mismatch
   when used as a suppression indication from the sender (or
   intermediary) to the receiver.  This document instead specifies a
   newly message for this function.  It further is more precise in the
   intended uses and less likely to be confusing to receivers.  It tells
   receivers explicitly that feedback for a particular packet loss is
   not needed and can provide an early indication before the receiver
   reacts to the loss and invokes its packet loss repair machinery.

   The Feedback Suppression message asks a receiver to not send feedback
   messages for particular packets (indicated by their RTP sequence
   numbers) independent of whether the receiver detected the packet loss
   or detected a need for a decoder refresh point).

   In order to detect packet loss before the receivers perceive it, one
   or more intermediate nodes are placed between the media sender and
   receiver (e.g., Distribution server, MCU, RTP translator).  These
   intermediaries monitor for packet loss upstream of themselves by
   checking RTP sequence numbers, just as receivers do.  Upon detecting
   (or suspecting) an upstream loss, the intermediary may either
   initiate its own feedback toward the source to provoke a
   retransmission, send Feedback Suppression message towards the
   receivers as defined in this specification, or both.

   Instead of using specialized intermediaries, another possibility is
   to instantiate one or more RTP receivers upstream of the loss region
   to act as immediate reporters as described in[DVB-IPTV].  These
   intermediate nodes need to take into account such factors as the
   tolerable application delay, the network dynamics, and the media
   type.  When the packet loss is detected upstream of the intermediary
   and additional latency is tolerable, the intermediate node may itself
   send a feedback message asking for retransmission of the suspected
   lost packet or ask for the correct decoder refresh point.  Because it
   has already provided the necessary feedback toward the source, the
   intermediate node can be reasonably certain that it will help the
   situation by sending a Feedback Suppression message to all the
   relevant receivers, thereby indicating that the receivers should not
   themselves transmit feedback messages.  When the sender receives the
   request from the intermediate node, the sender resends the missing
   packets to the receivers by using the RTP retransmission payload
   format [RFC4588]or resends a new refresh point for FIR Initiator
   [RFC5104], depending on the type of feedback it received.

   RTCP Feedback Storm Suppression follows the same semantic model as
   RTCP NACK - it conveys the packet receipt/loss events at the sequence

   number level and considers missing packets as unrepaired.  But unlike
   RTCP NACK, the Feedback Suppression messages can be generated at
   intermediate nodes who are not RTP receivers and sent to the
   corresponding receivers.  Intermediaries downsteam of an intermediary
   detecting loss obviously SHOULD NOT initiate their own additional
   feedback suppression messages for the same packet sequence numbers.
   They may either simply forward the Feedback Suppression message
   received from upstream, or augment (or replace) it with a feedback
   suppression message that reflects the loss pattern they have
   themselves seen.

   Since feedback suppression interacts strongly with repair timing, it
   has to work together with feedback and retransmission to not
   adversely impact the repair of lost source packets.  In some cases
   where the loss was detected and repair initiated much closer to the
   source, the delay for the receiver to recover from packet loss can be
   reduced through the combination of intermediary feedback to the
   source and feedback suppression downstream.  In all (properly
   operating) cases, the risk of increasing network congestion is
   decreased.  A receiver may still have sent a Feedback message before
   receiving a feedback suppression message, but further feedback
   messages for those sequence numbers will be suppressed by this
   technique.

   This document registers two new RTCP Feedback messages for Feedback
   Suppression.  Applications that are employing one or more loss-repair
   methods MAY use Feedback Suppression together with their existing
   loss-repair methods either for every packet they expect to receive,
   or for an application-specific subset of the RTP packets in a
   session.  In other words, receivers MAY ignore Feedback Suppression
   messages, but SHOULD react to them unless they have good reason to
   still send feedback messages despite having been requested to
   suppress them.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Intermediate Source:

      One intermediate node with logical function which is used to
      process or foward packet at the RTP layer.  The intermediate
      Source is located between media sender and receivers.  The
      examples of intermediate source are Distribution server, MCU, RTP
      translator.

   Upstream RTP Client:

      An RTP Client located in the upstream from the intermediate source
      as described in [DVB-IPTV].  This Client is able to detect
      upstream packet loss impacting all the RTP receivers serviced by
      the intermediate source and receiving SSM service.

   Immediate reporting RTP Client:

      An RTP Client located on a downstream aggregate link from the
      intermediate source as described in [DVB-IPTV].  This Client is
      able to detect downstream packet loss on the aggregate link or
      other nodes upstream of the aggregat link, thus impacting all the
      RTP receivers serviced by the intermediate source and receiving
      SSM service.

   Loss Reporter:

      The Loss Reporter is one logical function which is used to detect
      the packet loss at the RTP layer and report it to the intermediate
      source.  The function of the loss reporter may be collocated with
      or integrated into the same entity.  In this case, for a session
      defined as having a intermediate source A, on ports n for the RTP
      channel and k for the RTCP channel, the unicast RTCP Feedback
      Target is identified by an IP address of intermediate source A on
      port k.  The loss reporter MAY also be implemented in one or more
      entities different from the intermediate source.  In this case,
      the loss reporter may be an upstream RTP client or immediate
      reporting RTP client located on a downstream aggregate link of the
      intermediate source.


3.  Protocol Overview

   In order to avoid the forms of NACK implosion described in section 1,
   the loss reporter is introduced.  The loss reporter detects and
   reports packet loss, on both the upstream link and the downstream
   aggregate link.  When upstream link or downstream aggregate link
   packet loss occurs, the Loss reporter may inform intermediate source
   of the detected packet loss using Feedback Suppression messages.  In
   response, the intermediate source either forwards packet loss
   suppression report received from loss reporter or creates a Feedback
   Suppression report and sends it to all the RTP receivers, over the
   multicast channel.  This loss suppression report tells the receivers
   that the lost packet will either be forthcoming from intermediate
   source via retransmission, or it irretrievably lost such that there
   is nothing to be gained by the receiver sending a NACK to the media
   sender.  The intermediate source then can (optionally) ask for

Internet-Draft            Feedback Suppression              October 2010


   retransmission of the lost packets from the media sender on behalf of
   all the RTP receivers.  Upon receiving the lost packet via the RTP
   retransmission payload format, the intermediate source forwards the
   retransmitted packet to all the receivers.

   When the loss reporter(s) are part of a feedback target collocated
   with the intermediate source, redistribution of the feedback
   suppression report is trivial.  In such cases, the loss reporter
   function in the feedback target detects packet loss coming from an
   upstream link and informs the collocated intermediate source.  Also
   the loss reporter may detect packet loss occurring within
   intermediate source itself and report to intermediate source using
   the same method.  When the loss reporter(s) are physically and(or)
   topologically distinct from intermediate source, each loss reporter
   MUST create a packet loss report using the similar format as
   conventional RTCP NACK packets at the RTP layer and send it to the
   intermediate source .  The loss reporters may be upstream client or
   downstream immediate reporter who is dedicated to detect and report
   packet loss.

   The intermediate source must be able to communicate with all group
   members in order for either mechanism to be effective at suppressing
   feedback.  The general architecture is displayed below in Figure 1.

   In this figure, we assume the intermediate source is separated from a
   particular media sender and the loss reporter is part of feedback
   target collocated with intermediate source.  The communication
   between the media sender and the intermediate source is compliant
   with the methods described in [RFC5760].  Configuration information
   also follows [RFC5760], with the following additional considerations:

5.  SDP Signaling

   A new feedback value "fss" needs to be defined for the Feedback Storm
   Suppression message to be used with Session Description Protocol
   (SDP)[RFC4566] using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)[RFC4585].

   The "fss" feedback value SHOULD be used with parameters that indicate
   the feedback suppression supported.  In this document, we define two
   such parameters, namely:

   o  "fsei" denotes support of fir suppression early indication (fsei).

   o  "nsei" denotes support of NACK suppression early indication.

   In the ABNF for rtcp-fb-val defined in [RFC4585], there is a
   placeholder called rtcp-fb-id to define new feedback types. "fss" is
   defined as a new feedback type in this document, and the ABNF for the
   parameters for fss is defined here (please refer to section 4.2 of

6.  Example Use Cases

   The operation of feedback suppression is similar for all types of RTP
   sessions and topologies [RFC5117], however the exact messages used
   and the scenarios in which suppression is employed differ for various
   use cases.  The following sections outline the intended use cases for
   feedback suppression and give an overview of the particular
   mechanisms.

6.1.  Source Specific Multicast (SSM) use case

   In SSM RTP sessions as described in [RFC5760], one or more Media
   Senders send RTP packets to a Distribution Source.  The Distribution
   Source relays the RTP packets to the receivers using a source-
   specific multicast group.

   As outlined in the [RFC5760], there are two Unicast Feedback models
   that may be used for reporting, - the Simple Feedback model and the
   Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model.  The RTCP Feedback
   Suppression report extension specified in the section 4 of this
   document will work in both Feedback models.  Details of operation in
   each are specified below.

6.1.1.  Simple Feedback Model

   In the simple Feedback Model, the Loss reporter(s) are disjoint from
   the distribution source.  In this case, an upstream client or
   immediate reporting receiver may be chosen as the loss reporter.
   Also in this model, the distribution source includes support for
   retransmission as part of the offered SDP and expects such support
   from the Media Sender.

   As one dedicated receiver for packet loss reporting, the Loss
   reporter MUST listen on the corresponding RTP session for data.  When
   the Loss reporter observes that a sequence of RTP packets from a



Wu, et al.               Expires April 12, 2011                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft            Feedback Suppression              October 2010


   Media Sender contains gaps (by checking the sequence number of
   packets), the Loss reporter MUST use the same packet types as
   traditional RTCP feedback described in[RFC3550]and create one new
   RTCP Feedback Report with information on the RTP sequence number of
   the lost packets and suppression early indication event.  When a
   receiver is eligible to transmit, it MUST send this Report packet to
   the distribution source via unicast feedback.

   The Distribution Source (unicast Feedback Target) MUST listen for
   unicast RTCP data sent to the RTCP port.  Upon receiving the unicast
   RTCP Feedback Report packet from the loss reporter, the Distribution
   Source MUST forward it to the group on the multicast RTCP session.
   Every RTCP packet from each Loss reporter MUST be reflected
   individually.  If the loss reporter is part of group, the
   Distribution source MUST filter this packet out and not forward it
   back to this loss reporter.

   If there are multiple loss reporters looking at the same RTP stream,
   then the loss may be identified by more than one and those detecting
   the loss will all send requests for the same packet loss.  In this
   case, the distribution source MUST filter the duplicated packet loss
   request out and only forward one copy of the RTCP Feedback report
   packet from the first loss reporter to the group impacted by packet
   loss.

   This unicast RTCP Feedback Report lets the receivers know that
   feedback for this packet loss is not needed and should not be sent to
   the media sender(s).  If the Media Sender(s) are part of the SSM
   group for RTCP packet reflection, the Distribution Source MUST filter
   this packet out.  If the Media Sender(s) are not part of the SSM
   group for RTCP packets, the Distribution Source MUST not forward this
   RTCP packets received from the receivers to the Media Sender(s).

   When the receiver receives the RTCP packet, if the receiver
   understands the message it will not send feedback (e.g., NACK) for
   the missing packets reported in the message and will accept a
   retransmission packet (if forthcoming) transmitted from the
   Distribution Source.  If it did not understand the Feedback
   Suppression report the receiver may of course still send feedback
   messages to the specified media sender.  When the distribution source
   receives a feedback message reporting loss from one or more receivers
   after it has already detected packet loss or gotten a NACK feedback
   message from loss reporter, the distribution source MUST filter them
   out until the Retransmission stream is ready in the Distribution
   Source.

6.1.2.  Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model

   In the distribution source feedback summary model, the distribution
   source will include the support for retransmission as part of the
   offered SDP and will expect such support from the Media Sender, also
   the Loss reporter instance may be integrated in the distribution
   source or may be separated from the distribution source.  In some
   cases, several loss reporter instances for the same session can exist
   at the same time, e.g., one loss reporter instance (loss reporter A)
   is implemented in the upstream client A, one loss reporter instance
   (loss reporter B) is implemented in the upstream client B, another
   loss reporter instance for the same session (loss reporter C) is part
   of feedback target within the distribution source.  In this section,
   we focus on this generic case to discuss the distribution Source
   Feedback Summary Model.

   The Loss reporter A and the Loss reporter B MUST listen on the RTP
   channel for data.  When the Loss reporter observes RTP packets from a
   Media Sender are not consecutive by checking the sequence number of
   packets, the loss reporter generates NACK message described
   in[RFC4585] or generates the new RTCP Feedback Report packet
   described in the section 6, and then send either of them to the
   distribution source via unicast feedback.

   The Distribution Source (unicast Feedback Target) MUST listen for
   unicast RTCP data sent to the RTCP port.  Upon receiving the unicast
   RTCP Feedback Report packet from the loss reporter, the distribution
   source needs to filter them out, i.e., identify these unicast RTCP
   packets coming from the Dedicated receivers (i.e.,Loss Reporter A and
   Loss Reporter B)based on the IP address of loss reporters or
   dedicated RTCP port for loss report, then summarize the information
   received from all the RTCP Feedback Reports generated by the
   Dedicated receivers together with the information generated by the
   loss reporter integrated in the feedback target and then create the
   summary report to include all these information.  In order to reduce
   the processing load at the distribution source, the individual
   instance of Loss Reporter may provide preliminary summarization
   report.

   During the summary report creating, the Distribution Source MUST use
   its own SSRC value for transmitting summarization information and
   MUST perform proper SSRC collision detection and resolution.

   In some case, the distribution source may receive RTCP NACK messages
   from the receivers behind the Distribution Source before the
   distribution source detects the packet loss which may cause potential
   Feedback implosion.  In such case, the distribution source may filter
   them out if it already sent a packet loss request for the missing



Wu, et al.               Expires April 12, 2011                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft            Feedback Suppression              October 2010


   packet to the media sender.  When the distribution source confirms
   packet loss reported by the receiver, the distribution source
   generates the summary report to include the packet loss information
   from the corresponding receiver (e.g., upstream client or loss
   reporter).

   The distribution source may send this new RTCP summary report
   described in the section 6 to the group on the multicast RTCP channel
   and in the meanwhile sending a packet loss request to the media
   sender.

   If the loss reporter is part of group, the Distribution source MUST
   not send the summary report back to this loss reporter.

   If there are a couple of loss reporters looking at the same RTP
   stream, then the loss may be identified by all and they will all send
   requests for the same packet loss.  In this case, the distribution
   source MUST filter out the duplicated information from various loss
   reporters and only append one copy of such information to the summary
   report.

   When the host receives the RTCP packet, if the host understands this
   message it will not send packet loss request (e.g., NACK) for the
   missing packets reported in the message and will accept a
   retransmission stream transmitted from the Distribution Source.  If
   it did not understand this new message, the host may send packet loss
   request(e.g., NACK messages) to the specified media sender.  When the
   distribution source receives the packet loss request from the hosts
   after it has already detected packet loss or got packet loss report
   from loss reporter, the distribution source MUST filter it out until
   the Retransmission stream is ready in the Distribution Source.

6.2.  RTP transport translator use case

   A Transport Translator (Topo-Trn-Translator), as defined in [RFC5117]
   is typically forwarding the RTP and RTCP traffic between RTP clients,
   for example converting between multicast and unicast for domains that
   do not support multicast.  The translator can identify packet loss
   from the upstream and send the Feedback Suppression message to the
   unicast receivers.  The translator can also serve as a loss reporter
   on the multicast side as described in the SSM case.

6.3.  Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) use case

   In point to multipoint topologies using video switching MCU (Topo-
   Video-switch-MCU) [RFC5117], the MCU typically forwards a single
   media stream to each participant, selected from the available input
   streams.  The selection of the input stream is often based on voice



Wu, et al.               Expires April 12, 2011                [Page 15]

   activity in the audio-visual conference, but other conference
   management mechanisms (like presentation mode or explicit floor
   control) exist as well.

   In this case the MCU may detect packet loss from the sender or may
   decide to switch to a new source.  In both cases the receiver may
   lose synchronization with the video stream and may send a FIR
   request.  If the MCU itself can detect the mis-synchronization of the
   video, the MCU can send the FIR suppression message to the receivers
   and send a FIR request to the video source.


7.  Security Considerations

   The defined messages have certain properties that have security
   implications.  These must be addressed and taken into account by
   users of this protocol.

   Spoofed or maliciously created feedback messages of the type defined
   in this specification can have the following implications:

   Sending NACK Implosion Summary Suppression Indication with wrong
   sequence number of lost packet that makes missing RTP packets can not
   be compensated by retransmission mechanism.

   Sending FIR Implosion Summary Suppression Indication with wrong
   sequence number of lost packet that makes missing RTP packets can not
   be compensated by update request mechanism.

   To prevent these attacks, there is a need to apply authentication and
   integrity protection of the feedback messages.  This can be
   accomplished against threats external to the current RTP session
   using the RTP profile that combines Secure RTP [RFC3711] and AVPF
   into SAVPF [RFC5124].


8.  IANA Consideration

   New feedback type and New parameters for RTCP FSS receiver feedback
   report are subject to IANA registration.  For general guidelines on
   IANA considerations for RTCP feedback, refer to [RFC4585].

   This document assigns one new feedback type value x in the RTCP
   receiver feedback report registry to "Feedback Storm Suppression"
   with the following registrations format:

Appendix A.  Example scenarios for Retransmission Storm Suppression

   Feedback Storm Suppression can be further extended when a distributed
   content distribution network (CDN) are considered.  In these cases,
   several intermediate node and media senders may constitute
   hierarchical model.  In the distributed content distribution
   environment, the Feedback Storm Suppression is used to suppress the
   neighboring node from sending packet loss request for the missing
   packets via unicast.  How the neighboring node is discovered is
   beyond scope of this document.

A.1.  Scenario 1: One or more media sender,One distribution source

   The general architecture for scenario 1 is displayed below in
   Figure 4.  In this architecture, one or more Media Senders send RTP
   packets to the RTP Receivers through the same Distribution Source.
   The Distribution Source relays the RTP packets to the receivers using
   a source-specific multicast channel.  In the reverse direction, the
   receivers transmit RTCP packets via unicast to the distribution
   source.  The Distribution Source in turn relays RTCP packets to the
   media sender and then transmits the RTCP packets back to the
   receivers, using source-specific multicast.  When packet loss happens
   in the upstream link or downstream aggregate link of distribution
   source, it may result in massive retransmission request for the same
   RTP packets from all the receivers using RTCP NACK to the same
   multicast sender.  We refer to it as Retransmission Storm.

   distribution source in cascading and sends RTP packets to all the RTP
   receivers.  When packet loss happens in the upstream link or
   downstream aggregate link of distribution source1, it may result in
   massive retransmission request for the same RTP packets from all the
   receivers using RTCP NACK to the same multicast sender.  We refer to
   it as Retransmission Storm.  In this case, the distribution source 2
   can be taken as one special RTP receiver located in the downstream
   direction of distribution source 1.

A.3.  Scenario 3:One media sender, Two distribution sources in parallel

   The general architecture for scenario 3 is displayed below in
   Figure 6.  In this architecture, one media sender and two
   Distribution source constitute one hierarchical tree model.  In this
   model, one Media Senders send RTP packets to all the RTP receivers
   through two different path respectively.  When packet loss happens in
   the upstream link or downstream aggregate link of distribution
   source, it may result in massive retransmission request for the same
   RTP packets from all the receivers using RTCP NACK to the same
   multicast sender.  We refer to it as Retransmission Storm.

Appendix B.  Applicability of Feedback Storm Suppression

   This document defines new RTCP Receiver feedback Report, which we
   refer to as Feedback Storm Suppression to deal with Retransmission
   Storm mentioned above.  Here we give two examples to show how this
   new RTCP receiver feedback report is applied into three scenarios
   described in Appendix A for Retransmission Storm Suppression.

   Applicability of Retransmission Storm Suppression in Scenario 1
   described in Figure 4 is shown in the Figure 7.  In this figure, the
   distribution source detect the packet loss before the receiver
   perceive it and ask for retransmission of the missing packets from
   the media sender, in the meanwhile, the distribution source transmits
   the RTCP Retransmission Storm Suppression Indication back to the
   receivers using source-specific multicast channel.  In this way, the
   delay for the receiver to recover from the packet loss can be reduced
   and the risk of increasing network congestion can be mitigated.

     Figure 7: Applicability of Feedback Suppression Early Indication

   Applicability of Feedback Storm Suppression in Scenario 2 or 3
   described in Figure 5 and Figure 6 is shown in the Figure 8.  The
   procedure in the Figure 8 is similar to the one in the figure
   Figure 7.  The only difference is distribution source should not only
   notify all the receiver behind itself not to send NACK but also
   propagate the retransmission suppression indication to the
   neighboring distribution sources.  In this way, all the receivers
   behind all the neighboring distribution source can avoid sending
   massive retransmission request to the media sender.
