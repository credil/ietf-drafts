Internet-Draft       Sieve Notification: SIP MESSAGE         August 2007


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   The NOTIFY [NOTIFY] extension to the SIEVE [SIEVE] mail filtering
   language is a framework for providing notifications by employing URIs
   to specify the notification mechanism.  This document defines how SIP
   URIs (see RFC 3261 [RFC3261]) are used to generate notifications via
   the SIP MESSAGE (see RFC 3428 [RFC3428]).

1.2.  Terminology

   This document inherits terminology from NOTIFY [NOTIFY], SIEVE
   [SIEVE], and RFC 3261 [RFC3261].


2.  Definition

   The sip message mechanism results in the sending of a SIP MESSAGE
   request to notify a recipient about an email message.

2.1.  Notify parameter "method"

   The "method" parameter MUST be a URI that conforms to the SIP (or
   SIPS) URI scheme (as specified in RFC 3261 [RFC3261]) and that
   identifies a SIP (or SIPS) URI.  The URI MAY include the resource
   identifier portion of a SIP address and URI parameters.  The URI
   parameter "method" MUST be ignored, because only MESSAGE method is
   allowed by this specification.  The processing application MUST
   extract a SIP address from the URI in accordance with the processing
   rules specified in RFC 3261 [RFC3261].  The resulting SIP address
   MUST be encapsulated in SIP URI syntax as Request-URI and the value
   of the "To" header field of the SIP MESSAGE request.

2.2.  Notify tag ":from"

   The ":from" tag has no special meaning for this notification
   mechanism, and this specification puts no restriction on its use.  As
   noted, the value of the SIP "From" header field specified in the SIP
   notification message MUST be the SIP address of the notification
   service itself.  The value of the ":from" tag MUST use the SIP
   "Reply-To" syntax; if the :from value is specified and has valid
   syntax, it MUST be encapsulated as the value of a SIP header field
   named "Reply-To".  If the value has invalid syntax, this is
   considered a Sieve script processing error.

2.3.  Notify tag ":options"

   This tag is not used by this method.

2.4.  Notify tag ":importance"

   The value of the ":importance" tag MAY be transformed into SIP
   "Priority" header field (in addition to or instead of including in
   the default message); if specified, the value of the "Priority"
   header field MUST be "urgent" if the value of the ":importance" tag
   is "1", "normal" if the value of the ":importance" tag is "2", or
   "non-urgent" if the value of the ":importance" tag is "3".

2.5.  Notify tag ":message"

   If included, the ":message" tag MUST be transformed into the message-
   body of a SIP MESSAGE, which SHOULD have Content-Type value of "text/
   plain".  If not included, the rule specified in NOTIFY [NOTIFY]
   SHOULD be followed, as shown in the examples below.

2.6.  Other Definitions

   An implementation MUST ignore any URI parameter it does not
   understand (i.e., the URI MUST be processed as if the parameter were
   not present).  It is RECOMMENDED not to use the hname "body"
   parameter value as the message-body of the SIP MESSAGE request.  If
   hname "body" parameter and ":message" tag are presented at the same
   time, the "body" parameter MUST be ignored.

   The policy of retry delivery of a notification is a matter of
   implementation and is not specified herein.  But it SHOULD follow the
   suggestion for retry in RFC 3261 [RFC3261].


3.  Examples

   In the following examples, the sender of the email has an address of
   <mailto:juliet@example.org>, the entity to be notified has a SIP
   address of <sip:romeo@example.com>, and the notification service has
   a SIP address <sip:notifier@example.com>.

   The following is a basic Sieve notify action with only a method:

   notify "sip:romeo@example.com"

   The resulting SIP MESSAGE request might be as follows:

Internet-Draft       Sieve Notification: SIP MESSAGE         August 2007


      MESSAGE sip:romeo@example.com SIP/2.0
      Via: SIP/2.0/TCP notifier.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK776sgdkse
      Max-Forwards: 70
      From: sip:notifier@example.com;tag=32328
      To: sip:romeo@example.com
      Call-ID: asd88asd77a@1.2.3.4
      CSeq: 1 MESSAGE
      Content-Type: text/plain
      Content-Length: 43

      juliet@example.com; Contact me immediately!

   The following is a more advanced Sieve notify action with a method,
   importance, subject, and message:

   notify :importance "1"
          :message "Contact Juliet immediately!"
          "sip:romeo@example.com?subject=SIEVE"

      MESSAGE sip:romeo@example.com SIP/2.0
      Via: SIP/2.0/TCP notifier.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK776sgdkse
      Max-Forwards: 70
      From: sip:notifier@example.com;tag=32328
      To: sip:romeo@example.com
      Subject: SIEVE
      Priority: urgent
      Call-ID: asd88asd77a@1.2.3.4
      CSeq: 1 MESSAGE
      Content-Type: text/plain
      Content-Length: 27

      Contact Juliet immediately!


4.  Internationalization Considerations

   TBD


5.  Security Considerations

   UAs that support the MESSAGE request MUST implement end-to-end
   authentication, body integrity, and body confidentiality mechanisms.


6.  Acknowledgements

   TBD
