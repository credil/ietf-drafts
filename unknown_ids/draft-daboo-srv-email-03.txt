Internet-Draft                SRV for Email                February 2010


1.  Introduction

   Internet Email protocols include SMTP [RFC5321], IMAP [RFC3501] and
   POP3 [RFC1939].  IMAP and POP3 are both message store access
   protocols used by message store user agents (MUAs) to manipulate
   email messages after delivery.  [RFC4409] defines a "profile" of the
   SMTP service that is specifically used for message submission.  MUAs
   are expected to submit messages to mail submission agents (MSAs)
   using this approach.

   [RFC2782] defines a DNS-based service discovery protocol that has
   been widely adopted as a means of locating particular services within
   a local area network and beyond, using DNS SRV Resource Records
   (RRs).

   [RFC5321] specifies how to use DNS MX RRs to locate SMTP services for
   a domain.  However, MUAs are expected to use the submission protocol
   defined in [RFC4409] which does not use MX records.

   Typically MUAs have required users to enter a fully qualified domain
   name (FQDN) and port information for the services they need.  This is
   not ideal as the way in which server configuration information is
   specified can differ from MUA to MUA, and can be confusing to users,
   leading to errors when inputting the details.  Alternatively, some
   MUAs have adopted a complex "auto-discovery" process involving
   probing a domain to see what services might be available.  A better
   approach to all this would be to require minimal information to be
   entered by a user which would result in automatic configuration of
   appropriate services for that user.  The minimal information entered
   would be the user's email address.

   This specification defines new SRV service types for the message
   submission, IMAP and POP3 services, to enable simple auto-
   configuration of MUAs.  The priority field of the SRV record can also
   be used to indicate a preference for one message store access
   protocol over another.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Email-related terminology from [RFC5598] is used.

Internet-Draft                SRV for Email                February 2010


3.  SRV Service Labels

3.1.  Email Submission

   This specification adds one SRV service label for message submission
   [RFC4409]:

   submission:  Identifies an MSA using [RFC4409].  Note that this
      covers connections both with and without transport layer security
      [RFC3207].

   Example: service record

       _submission._tcp     SRV 0 1 587 mail.example.com.

3.2.  IMAP

   This specification adds two SRV service labels for IMAP [RFC3501]:

   _imap:  Identifies an IMAP server that MAY advertise the
      "LOGINDISABLED" capability and MAY require the MUA to use the
      "STARTTLS" command prior to authentication.  Although these two
      extensions are mandatory-to-implement for both MUAs and IMAP
      servers, they are not mandatory-to-use by service providers.

   _imaps:  Identifies an IMAP server where transport layer security is
      initiated directly upon connection to the IMAP server.

   Example: service record

       _imap._tcp     SRV 0 1 143 imap.example.com.

   Example: service record

       _imaps._tcp    SRV 0 1 993 imap.example.com.

3.3.  POP3

   This specification adds two SRV service labels for POP3 [RFC1939]:

   _pop3:  Identifies a POP3 server that MAY require the MUA to use the
      "STLS" extension command [RFC2595] prior to authentication.

   _pop3s:  Identifies a POP3 server where transport layer security is
      initiated directly upon connection to the POP3 server.

   Example: service record

       _pop3._tcp     SRV 0 1 110 pop3.example.com.

   Example: service record

       _pop3s._tcp    SRV 0 1 995 pop3.example.com.

3.4.  Priority for Domain Preferences

   The priority field in the SRV RR allows a domain to indicate that
   some records have a higher preference than others in the DNS query
   results (determined by those records having a lower priority value).
   Typically, this is used for choosing a record from a set for a single
   service label, however it is not restricted to choice within only one
   service.

   Often a site will offer both IMAP and POP3 message store access
   services for users.  However, the site may have a preference for one
   over the other that they want to convey to the user to ensure that,
   when the user has an MUA capable of using both IMAP and POP3, that
   the preferred choice is used.

   To aid with this choice, sites should offer both IMAP and POP3 SRV
   records in their DNS and set the priority for both sets of records
   such that the "preferred" service has a lower priority value than the
   other.  When an MUA supports both IMAP and POP3 it SHOULD retrieve
   records for both services and then use the service with the lowest
   priority value.  If the priority is the same for both services, MUAs
   are free to choose which ever one is appropriate.

   Example: service records for both IMAP and POP3, with IMAP having a
   lower priority value (0) then POP3 (10), indicating to the MUA that
   IMAP is preferred over POP3, when the MUA can support either service.

       _imap._tcp     SRV  0 1 143 imap.example.com.
       _pop3._tcp     SRV 10 1 110 pop3.example.com.

4.  Guidance for MUAs

   By using SRV records as above, MUAs need initially only prompt the
   user for their email address [RFC5322].  The "local-part" and
   "domain" portions are then extracted from the email address by the
   MUA.  The MUA uses the "domain" portion as the service domain to
   perform SRV lookups for the services it wants to configure.  If the
   SRV lookup is successful the target FQDN and port for the service can
   be determined and used to complete MUA configuration.  If an SRV
   record is not found, the MUA will need to prompt the user to enter

Internet-Draft                SRV for Email                February 2010


   the FQDN and port information directly, or use some other heuristic.
   In the case of multiple SRV records returned for a particular
   service, the MUA MUST use the priority and weight fields in the
   record to determine which one to use (as per [RFC2782]).

   MUAs that support both POP3 and IMAP use the procedure in Section 3.4
   to choose between each service when both are offered.

   Subsequent to configuration, the MUA will connect to the service.
   When using "imaps" or "pop3s" services, a transport layer security
   negotiation is done immediately upon connection.  With "imap", "pop3"
   and "submission" services, the "STARTTLS", "STLS" and "STARTTLS"
   commands respectively are used to initiate a protected connection.
   When using transport layer security in this way, MUAs SHOULD use the
   TLS Server Name Indication [RFC4366].  Certificate verification MUST
   use the procedure outlined in Section XXX of
   [I-D.saintandre-tls-server-id-check] in regard to verification with
   an SRV RR as the starting point.

   Once a suitable connection has been made, and any required protection
   setup, the MUA will typically need to authenticate with the IMAP,
   POP3 or SMTP (submission) server.  The details of that are governed
   by the specific protocols themselves, though often times a "user
   identifier" is required for some form of user/password
   authentication.  When a user identifier is required, MUAs MUST first
   use the full email address provided by the user, and if that results
   in an authentication failure, SHOULD fall back to using the "local-
   part" extracted from the email address.  This is in line with the
   guidance outlined in Section 5.  If both these user identifiers
   result in authentication failure, the MUA SHOULD prompt the user for
   a valid identifier.

   Once a successful connection and authentication have been done, MUAs
   SHOULD cache the service details (hostname, port, user identity) that
   were successfully used, and re-use those when connecting again at a
   later time.  However, if a subsequent connection attempt fails, or
   authentication fails, MUAs SHOULD re-try the SRV lookup to "refresh"
   the cached data.

5.  Guidance for Service Providers

   Service providers wanting to offer IMAP, POP3 or SMTP (submission)
   services that can be configured by MUAs using SRV records need to
   follow certain guidelines to ensure proper operation.

   a.  IMAP, POP3 and SMTP (submission) servers SHOULD be configured to
       allow authentication with email addresses or email local-parts.
       In the former case, the email addresses MUST NOT conflict with



Daboo                    Expires August 9, 2010                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                SRV for Email                February 2010


       other forms of permitted user login name.  In the latter case,
       the email local-parts need to be unique across the server and
       MUST NOT conflict with any login name on the server.

   b.  If the service provider uses transport layer security, the
       service provider MUST ensure a certificate is installed that can
       be verified by MUAs using the procedure outlined in Section XXX
       of [I-D.saintandre-tls-server-id-check] in regard to verification
       with an SRV RR as the starting point.  If the service provider
       hosts multiple domains on the same IP address, then the service
       provider MUST enable support for the TLS Server Name Indication
       [RFC4366].

   c.  Install the appropriate SRV records for the offered services.

6.  Security Considerations

   If a user has explicitly requested a connection with transport layer
   security (user interfaces sometimes present this choice as a "use
   SSL" or "secure connection" checkbox), the MUA MUST successfully
   negotiate transport layer security prior to sending an authentication
   command.  The MUA MAY do this with "imaps", "pop3s", "imap" with
   "STARTTLS", or "pop3" with "STLS".  Service providers MAY offer any
   subset of these four options for the mail service.

   A malicious attacker with access to the DNS server data, or able to
   get spoofed answers cached in a recursive resolver, can potentially
   cause MUAs to connect to any IMAP, POP3 or submission server chosen
   by the attacker.  In the absence of a secure DNS option, MUAs SHOULD
   check that the target FQDN returned in the SRV record matches the
   original service domain that was queried.  If the target FQDN is not
   in the queried domain, MUAs SHOULD verify with the user that the SRV
   target FQDN is suitable for use before executing any connections to
   the host.  Alternatively, if transport layer security is being used
   for the email service, MUAs MUST use the procedure outlined in
   Section XXX of [I-D.saintandre-tls-server-id-check] to verify the
   service.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any actions on the part of IANA.
