Abstract

   Appendix A of [RFC4862] discusses Loopback Suppression and Duplicate
   Address Detection (DAD).  However, [RFC4862] does not settle on one
   specific automated means to detect Loopback of Neighbor Discovery
   (ND) [RFC4861] messages used by DAD.  Several service provider
   communities have expressed a need for automated detection of looped
   backed ND messages used by DAD.  This document outlines an algorithm
   to automate detection of looped back IPv6 ND messages.  Further, for
   certain access networks the document automates resolving a specific
   duplicate address conflict.

1.  Terminology

   o  DAD-failed state - Duplication Address Detection failure as
      specified in [RFC4862].

   o  Looped back message - also referred to as a reflected message.
      The message sent by the sender is received by the sender due to
      the network or a Upper Layer Protocol on the sender looping the
      message back.


2.  Introduction

   Appendix A of [RFC4862] discusses Loopback Suppression and Duplicate
   Address Detection (DAD).  However, [RFC4862] does not settle on one
   specific automated means to detect Loopback of ND messages used by
   DAD.  One specific DAD message is a Neighbor Solicitation (NS),
   specified in [RFC4861].  The NS is issued by the network interface of
   an IPv6 node for DAD.  Another message involved in DAD is a Neighbor
   Advertisement (NA).  The algorithm proposed in this document focuses
   on detecting any of NS or NA looped back to the transmitting
   interface during the DAD operation.  The algorithm is also applicable
   to detecting any looped back ND message.

   Recently service providers have reported a DAD loopback problem.
   IPv6 Loopback testing is underway on a router.  A network interface
   of the router is enabled for IPv6.  The interfaces issues an NS for
   the IPv6 link-local address DAD.  The NS is reflected back to the
   interface due to the Loopback test and the interface is stuck in a
   DAD-failed state requiring manual intervention.  In another service
   provider network, two broadband modems in a home have the Ethernet
   ports of each modem connected to a network hub.  The access
   concentrator serving the modems is the first-hop IPv6 router for the
   modems.  The access concentator also supports proxying of DAD
   messages.  Each modem is IPv4 online.  The network interface of the
   access concentrator serving the two broadband modems is enabled for
   IPv6 and the interface issues a NS message to perform DAD for the
   IPv6 link-local address.  The NS message reaches one modem first and
   this modem sends the message to the hub which sends the message to
   the second modem which forwards the message back to the access
   concentrator.  The looped back NS message causes the network
   interface on the access concentrator to be in a DAD-failed state.
   Such a network interface typically serves over six thousand broadband
   modems causing all the modems (and hosts behind the modems) to fail
   to get IPv6 online on the access network.  Additionally, it may be
   tedious for the access concentrator to find out which of the six
   thousand or more homes looped back the DAD message.  Clearly there is
   a need for automated detection of looped back ND messages, especially

   during the DAD operation on the node.


3.  Algorithm to Detect Looped Back ND message

   The document proposes use of the Nonce Option (specified in
   [RFC3971]).  The nonce is a random number as specified in [RFC3971].
   If SEND is enabled on the router and the router also supports the new
   automated ND Loopback detection (specified in this document), there
   is integration with the algorithm of this document and SEND.  See
   more details in the Impact on SEND section.

   When the IPv6 network interface issues a NS message to perform DAD,
   the interface includes the Nonce Option in the NS message and saves
   the nonce in local store.  Subsequently if the interface receives an
   identical NS message, the interface logs a system management message,
   updates any statistics counter, and drops the looped back NS.  If the
   DupAddrDetectTransmits variable for the interface is greater than
   one, subsequent NS messages for the same Target Address should be
   suppressed.  If the interface receives a NS message with a different
   nonce, the interface logs a DAD-failed system management message,
   updates any statistics, and behaves identical to the behavior
   specified in [RFC4862] for DAD failure.  Also, see the section titled
   Integration with Optimistic DAD.  The algorithm is also applicable to
   a node that supports DNA as specified in [RFC6059].

   The algorithm also applies to detect any ND solicitation (NS and
   Router Solicitation) or advertisement (NA and Router Advertisement)
   that is looped back.  Saving a nonce and nonce related data for all
   ND messages has impact on memory of the node.  Thus this algorithm
   recommends at least detecting looped back ND messages during DAD.
   Detecting any other looped back ND messages when the node is not
   involved in DAD is optional.

3.1.  General Rules

   A node MUST implement detection of looped back NS and NA messages
   during DAD.  The node MAY support detection of other ND messages
   looped back at all other times.

3.2.  Processing Rules for Senders

   If a node has been configured to use the algorithm of this document,
   all ND messages MUST include the Nonce Option in the ND message.
   When sending the message, the node MUST store the nonce internally so
   that the node can match any looped back ND message.  If the
   DupAddrDetectTransmits variable for the interface is greater than
   one, subsequent NS message for the same Target Address SHOULD be

   suppressed.

3.3.  Processing Rules for Receivers

   The node has been configured to use the algorithm of this document.
   If the node receives any ND message with a nonce that matches an
   existing nonce saved on the node, the node logs a system management
   message, updates any statistics counter, and MUST drop the received
   message.  If the received ND message includes a nonce and no match is
   found with a saved nonce on the node, the node logs a system
   management message for DAD-failed and updates any statistics counter.


4.  Impact on SEND

   The SEND document uses the Nonce Option in the context of matching an
   NA with an NS.  However, no text in SEND has an explicit mention of
   detecting looped back ND messages.  If this document updates
   [RFC4862], SEND should be updated to integrate with the algorithm of
   this document.  A minor update to SEND would be to explicitly mention
   that the nonce in SEND is also used by SEND to detect looped back ND
   messages.  In a mixed SEND environment with SEND and unsecured nodes,
   SEND nodes MUST accept an unsecured NA in response to a NS issed for
   DAD where the NA includes a new nonce.  Such a case signals a DAD
   failure to the receiver of the NA.  In a mixed environment, the
   lengths of the nonce used by SEND and unsecured nodes MUST be
   identical.


5.  Integration with Optimistic DAD

   The algorithm of this document also supports Optimistic DAD as
   specified in [RFC4429].  On receiving an NA with a nonce that does
   not match any nonce on the ON, the ON (see [RFC4429]) immediately
   stops using the address and deconfigures the address.


6.  Changes to RFC 4862

   The following text is added to [RFC4862] at a yet to be determined
   location in [RFC4862].

   A router that supports IPv6 ND MUST implement the detection of looped
   back ND messages as specified in this document.  A network interface
   on any other IPv6 node that is not a router SHOULD implement the
   detection of looped back ND messages as specified in this document.

7.  Actions to Perform on Detecting a Genuine Duplicate

   The nonce can also serve to detect genuine duplicates even when the
   network has potential for looping back ND messages.  When a genuine
   duplicate is detected, the node follows the manual intervention
   specified in section 5.4.5 of [RFC4862].  However, in certain
   networks such as an access network if the genuine duplicate matches
   the IPv6 tentative address of a network interface of the access
   concentrator, automated actions are proposed.  One access network is
   a cable broadband deployment where the access concetrator is the
   first-hop IPv6 router.  The router also supports proxying of DAD
   messages.  If the network interface on the access concentrator
   initiates DAD for an IPv6 address and an NS or an NA message with a
   new nonce is received, a genuine duplicate has been detected.  On
   detecting such a duplicate the access concentrator, logs a system
   management DAD-failed message and blocks the modem on whose layer 2
   service identifier (id) the NS or NA message was received on.

   The network described above follows a trust model where a trusted
   router serves untrusted IPv6 host nodes.  Operators of such networks
   have a desire to take automated action if a network interface of the
   trusted router has a tentative address duplicate with a host the
   trusted router interface serves.  Note that the access concentator
   broadband deployment has over three hundred million subscribers
   worldwide.  Any other network that follows the same trust model MAY
   use the automated actions proposed in this section.


8.  Security Considerations

   The nonce can be exploited by a rogue deliberately changing the nonce
   to fail the looped back detection algorithm.  SEND is recommended for
   this exploit.


9.  IANA Considerations

   None.
