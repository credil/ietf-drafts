    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Spam has grown from being:
<list style="symbols">
          <t>An interesting side-effect of new technology.</t>

          <t>A sometimes useful marketing tool.</t>
	  <t>An overload of inbox-time.</t>

	  <t>An overload of bandwidth.</t>

        </list> 
This document suggests a technique for reducing spam dispersion.
Some estimates put spam traffic at astonishing levels.
Reports are available which speak in terms of 50% of email traffic.
Clearly there is much to be saved with reducing this traffic.
</t></section>
<section title='A basic Did You Send protocol description.'>
<t>A fundamental question in confirming the origins of an object
is to ask if it was sent by the sender.
Current smtp sessions are in the main, send and move on the next task.
There are of course, many tests made by the receiving agent
as to the validity of the email.
Though in search of a basic confirmation exchange,
it could be found that a mechanism is already half in place.
In the form of the MessageID header of every email.
If the sending agent stores the MessageID data for a length of
time, then the receiving agent was to query the originating agent
on this field, confirmation of the send could be confirmed or denied.
</t></section>
<section title='Processing requirements.'>
<t>It may have been impossible for earlier agent implementations
to do this due to the storage and processing requirements percieved.
The cost of these is now greatly reduced.
Calculations would show it to be cheaper than the cost of 
current spam volumes.
Additionally, product such as SQLite have not been available until recently.
</t>
</section>
<section title='Message ID header.'>
<t>The MessageID is a header field generated by a sending smtp<xref target="RFC2821"></xref> server.
Although Message-ID generation does need to be globally unique, 
there is an Internet Draft which suggests this possibility: 
draft-ietf-usefor-message-id-01.txt  
It is generally generated to be locally unique.
It usually uses the FQDN as a suffix, though as there has been no reason to 
use the uniqueness across domains, non-FQDN use has not been questioned.
</t>
</section>
<section title='Uptake scenario.'>
<t>To ensure a reasonable path to implementation, conforming agents
could be given a bypass filter.
This would reduce load on filters, reducing load on servers.
</t></section>
<section title='Major advantages.'><t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Of significant annoyance to emailer.1 occurs when bounces are received from emailer.2 who have spam which appears to originate from emailer.1's domain, when in fact they are from a spamming bot-net or similar.
</t><t> Reduction in spam, registered addresses.</t>
<t>Reduction of virus payloaded spam.</t></list></t>
</section>
<section title='Techniques for avoidance.'>
<t>Spammers will require a registered domain with a DYS enabled server.
Reverse tracking is therefore possible. Confirmation the spam was sent is implied.
In countries where spam is illegal, this may be useful as evidence.
In other countries, the sending smtp server is visible and block able.
</t></section>
<section title='Denial of service risk.' anchor='DOSrisk'>
<t><list style="symbols">
<t>Scenario 1: Spammer creates botnet which targets a number of domains. 
The domain's issue DYS's towards (unconfirmed) originating server/s (DYS.UOS).
The UOS's reply with many DYS 'UNKNOWN'.
UOS's are inundated with DYS requests with possible adverse effects.
This requires a map of domains to smtp servers.This can be gained from MX records.
Response to this attack could be a focussed blacklist.</t><t>
Scenario 2: Spammer creates botnet which directly issues bogus DYS requests.
Mitigation: Check of reverse IP MX record would indicate a firewall rule is required</t>
<t>Scenario 3: Spammer uses registered MX server to send spam.
A firewall trigger could block traffic after a number of requests.
</t></list></t></section>
<section title='Potential reduction of spam.'>
<t>This is a function of co-operating smtp agents.
If all agents used this protocol, then 'spam' as we know it would be greatly reduced.</t>
</section>
<section title='Configure options.'><t>
The sending agent has options on storage period of sent ID's.
Subsequent handling of receipts could flag or delete the sent.ID.
The sending agent could flag the sent.ID with the time of receipt.

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
