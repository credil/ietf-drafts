Internet-Draft      AAA Support for MAG/LMA Locating        October 2009


Abstract

   In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the
   the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically
   tunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing.  The term
   "localized routing" refers to a method by which packets are routed
   directly by the MAG without involving the LMA.  In order to establish
   a localized routing session between two Mobile Access Gateways in a
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, two tasks must be accomplished:

   1.  The usage of local routing must be authorized for both MAGs and

   2.  The address of the MAG to which the Correspondent Node (CN) is
       attached must be discovered

   This document specifies how to accomplish these tasks using the
   Diameter protocol

Internet-Draft      AAA Support for MAG/LMA Locating        October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6 [RFC5213] allows the Mobility Access
   Gateway to optimize media delivery by locally routing packets within
   itself, avoiding tunneling them to the Mobile Node's Local Mobility
   Anchor.  This is referred to as "local routing" in RFC 5213.
   However, this mechanism is not applicable to the typical scenario
   where the MN and CN are under different MAGs and belong to different
   LMAs.  In this scenario (as described in
   [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip6-lr-ps]), the relevant information needed to
   set up a localized routing path (e.g., the Mobile Access Gateways to
   which the MN and CN are respectively attached) is distributed between
   their respective Local Mobility Anchors.  This may complicate the
   setup and maintenance of localized routing.

   Therefore, in order to establish a localized routing path between the
   two Mobile Access Gateways, the Mobile Node's MAG must discover which
   LMA is managing the Correspondent Node's traffic and then fetch the
   address of the Correspondent Node's MAG from that LMA.  In Proxy
   Mobile IPv6, the LMA to be assigned to CN may be maintained as a
   configured entry in the Correspondent Node's policy profile located
   on a Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server.
   However, there is no relevant work discussing how the Correspondent
   Node's LMA is discovered by Mobile Node's MAG in terms of the
   Correspondent Node's Home Network Prefix (HNP) using AAA-based
   mechanisms during the setup of localized routing.  The method by
   which the Mobile Node's MAG interacts with the Correspondent Node's
   LMA to identify the Correspondent Node's MAG is also unspecified.

   This document describes AAA support for the authorization and
   discovery of PMIPv6 mobility entities during localized routing.  In
   LMA discovery, Diameter [RFC3588] is used to authorize the localized
   routing service and provide the Mobile Node's MAG/LMA with
   information regarding the Correspondent Node's LMA.  In MAG
   discovery, AAA is used to determine whether Mobile Node's MAG is
   allowed to fetch the address of the Correspondent Node's MAG from the
   Correspondent Node's LMA.  If MAG discovery is successful, the the
   Correspondent Node's LMA will respond to the Mobile Node's MAG with
   the address of the Correspondent Node's MAG.

3.  Solution Overview

   MAG/LMA resolution is a prerequisite to the establishment of a direct
   routing path between MAG1 and MAG2 (associated with MN1 and MN2
   respectively), this document addresses how to resolve the destination
   MN's MAG by means of interaction between the MAG and the AAA server,
   and between the LMA and the AAA server.  Figure 1 shows the reference
   architecture for the MAG resolution.  This reference architecture
   assumes

   o  MN1 and MN2 belong to different LMA

   o  the MAG and LMA support Diameter client functionality

   Figure 1: Local Routing Service Authorization Reference Architecture

   The interaction of the MAG and LMA with the AAA server is a two step
   procedure involving

   1.  The MAG1 or LMA1 interaction with the AAA server is used to
       authorize the localized routing service and fetch the IP address
       of LMA2 from the AAA server (step 'a' in (Figure 1))

   2.  LMA2 interaction with the AAA server is used to determine whether
       MAG1 is allowed to obtain the IP address of MAG2 (step 'b' in

       (Figure 1))


4.  Locating the Recipient of Localized Routing

   Figure 2 shows a scenario where MAG1 acts as a Diameter client,
   processing the data packet from MN1 to MN2 and requesting the
   recipient of localized routing.  In this scenario, MN1 and MN2 are
   anchored to LMA1 and LMA2 respectively.  When MAG2 intends to setup a
   localized routing path between MAG1 and MAG2, it first needs to
   locate the entity which maintains the information needed to setup the
   localized routing path (i.e., LMA2).  The Diameter client in MAG1
   sends a AAR message to the Diameter server.  One new value of service
   type, i.e., localized routing should be defined in the Service-Type
   AVP described in [RFC4005].

   and encapsulated in the MAG-HAAA AVPs of Authentication Authorization
   Request (AAR) message with PMIP6-MN-HNP AVP for MN2 by the MAG1.  The
   Diameter server processes this new Service-Type value and PMIP6-MN-
   HNP AVP for MN2 in accordance with[RFC4005].  In the successful case,
   the Diameter server looks up the IP address of LMA2 based on IP
   address/HNP of MN2 and responds with an Authentication Authorization
   Answer (AAA) message containing the IP address of LMA2 in a new
   defined AVP.  MAG1 extracts the IP address of LMA2 from the Diameter
   message and requests the address of MAG2 from LMA2 and uses that
   address to setup the localized routing path between itself and MAG2
   via the Proxy Binding Update (PBU)/Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   (PBA) message exchange [RFC5213].

           Figure 2: Locating the Recipient of Localized Routing

   Figure 3 shows another scenario, in which the LMA1 may act as a
   Diameter client, processing the data packet from MN1 to MN2 and
   requesting the recipient of localized routing.  In this scenario, MN1
   and MN2 are anchored to LMA1 and LMA2 respectively.  In contrast with
   the signaling flow of Figure 2 the difference is that it is LMA1
   instead of MAG1 who solicits the IP address of LMA2 from the Diameter
   server.

   First, the Diameter client in the LMA1 sends a AAR message to the
   Diameter server.  One new service type for localized routing should
   be defined in the Service-Type AVP and encapsulated in the LMA-HAAA
   AVPs of Authenticate and authorize Request (AAR) message by the LMA1.
   The Diameter server processes this new service type for PMIP6
   mobility entities discovery in accordance with [RFC4005].  In the
   successful case, it looks up the IP address of LMA2. based on the IP
   address/HNP of MN2 obtained from the destination address of the
   upstream packet from MN1 and responds to the LMA1 with a AAA message
   containing the IP address of LMA2.  Upon receiving the AAA message,
   the LMA forwards the LMA2 IP address to MAG1 in the Notification
   request message.

           Figure 3: Locating the Recipient of Localized Routing

   Figure 4 shows the third example signaling flow for MAG and LMA
   signaling interaction with AAA server.  In this figure, in contrast
   with the examples in the figure 2 and figure 3, the IP address of
   MAG2 is resolved by LMA1 based on IP address/HNP of MN2 with the help
   of AAA interaction defined in this specification and inform the MAG1
   of the IP address of MAG2.

   In the step 1 of example, the procedure is same as that of example in
   the figure 3.  What's the difference is the LMA1 does not inform the
   MAG1 of LMA2 IP address, instead, during the step 2, the LMA1 solicit
   LMA2 to resolve IP address of MAG2 which MN2 is currently attached to
   by sending AAA request message containing IP address/HNP of MN2.  In
   this step, the LMA2 needs to validate the request from LMA1 by
   sending AAR to the AAA server with IP address/HNP of MN1 included.
   The AAA makes authorization based on the IP address/HNP of MN1 and
   check the new service type for MAG resolution encapsulated in the
   LMA-AAA AVPs.  In successful case, the AAA responds to the LMA with
   success status.  And then LMA2 lookup IP address of MAG2 based on the
   IP address/HNP of MN2 and responds to the LMA1 with the IP address of
   MAG2 which is forwarded in the Notification request message to the
   MAG1.

5.  Diameter server authorizes to Query MAG Location

   Figure 5 shows a scenario where LMA2 may act as Diameter Client,
   receiving location request and requesting authorization for MAG
   location lookup.  In this scenario, MN1 and MN2 are anchored to LMA1
   and LMA2 respectively.  Upon receiving upstream data packet, MAG1
   needs to determine the recipient of localized routing, i.e., LMA2.
   And then MAG1 solicit the LMA2 to lookup IP address of MAG2 to which
   MN2 is currently attached by sending localized routing request
   message containing IP address/HNP of MN1 and MN2.  In this step, the
   LMA2 needs to validate the request from MAG1 by sending Authenticate
   and authorize request(AAR) to the AAA server.  In the AAR message, IP
   address/HNP of MN1 and the new service type for localized routing is
   included.  The Diameter Server makes authorization based on the IP

   address/HNP of MN1 and checks the new service type for localized
   routing encapsulated in the LMA-AAA AVPs.  In successful case, the
   Diameter Server responds to the LMA with success status.  And then
   LMA2 lookup IP address of MAG2 based on the IP address/HNP of MN2 and
   respond to the MAG1 with the IP address of MAG2.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for ther Diameter NASREQ [RFC4005] and
   Diameter Proxy Mobile IPv6 applications [I-D.ietf-dime-pmip6] are
   applicable to this document.

   The service authorization solicited by the MAG or the LMA can rely on
   the existing trust relationship between the MAG/LMA and the AAA
   server.
