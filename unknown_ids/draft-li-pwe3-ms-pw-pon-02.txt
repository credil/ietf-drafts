          Multisegment Pseudowires in Passive Optical Networks
                       draft-li-pwe3-ms-pw-pon-02

Abstract

   This document describes the application of multi-segment pseudowires
   (MS-PWs) in a dual-technology environment comprising a Passive
   Optical Network (PON) and a Packet Switched Network (PSN).

   Static configuration of at least one PW segment is a typical case for
   a MS-PW.  This is often one of the end segments and, in the case of
   mobile backhaul, it is the segment closest to the aggregation device.
   But, when MS-PW is implemented in a PON, there may be a very large
   number of PW Terminating Provider Edge nodes (T-PEs).  This makes
   static provisioning a heavy burden for the network manager.

   Making use of a Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (GPON)
   management protocol helps to reduce the labor of configuration,
   simplify and speed up the PW provision procedure to a great extent,
   and notify to switching Provider Edge node (S-PE) (which is the
   Optical Line Termination node (OLT)) of the status of the AC at the
   T-PE (which is the Optical Network Unit (ONU)).

   This document describes how to end-to-end MPLS MS-PWs can be provided
   through the integration of MPLS and GPON provisioning and control
   protocols, and describes how the MPLS-PW can be carried by the link
   layer of the GPON with penultimate hop popping (PHP).  This document
   does not make any changes to the mechanisms for MPLS PWs.

1.  Introduction

   The use of pseudowires (PWs) in Packet Switched Networks (PSNs) is
   defined in [RFC3985].  This architecture is extended in [RFC5659] for
   multi-segment pseudowires (MS-PWs) satisfying the requirements in
   [RFC5254].  More detail on MS-PWs is provided in
   [draft-ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw].

   MS-PW is a useful technology for certain applications where there is
   an aggregation of paths toward a common point in the network, e.g.
   mobile backhaul.

   Segments of a MS-PW in a PSN can be setup using manual provisioning
   (static PWs) or using a dynamic control plane such as the Label
   Distribution Protocol [RFC5036].

   In many scenarios in access and metro networks, Passive Optical
   Network (PON) provides longer distance, higher bandwidth with better
   economy than other technologies like point-to-point Ethernet or
   Digital Subscriber Line (DSL).  Mobile backhaul with PON is already
   being deployed.

                 Figure A: Typical PON System Architecture

   In a PON, the Optical Network Unit (ONU) and Optical Line Termination
   (OLT) are adjacent nodes connected by an Optical Distribution Network



Zheng, et al.            Expires April 28, 2011                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  MS-PW-PON                   October 2010


   (ODN), which consists of optical fibers and optical splitters in a
   tree topology.  The link between each ONU and OLT is simulated as a
   point-to-point link, and there is no redundant path between them.
   The OLT resides in the central office, while ONUs reside in customer
   premises.  ONUs are deployed in huge numbers and so they are cost
   sensitive.  Figure A depicts the physical infrastructure of an ODN
   and more information about ODNs can be found in [G.984.1].

   In a mobile backhaul network, many 2G and 3G base stations still use
   legacy interfaces like TDM and ATM.  Therefore, PWs have to start
   from devices directly connected to the base stations.  In the case of
   mobile backhauling with PON, ONUs connected with base stations are
   Terminating Provider Edge nodes (T-PEs), while the OLT is the
   Switching Provider Edge (S-PE).  Routing protocols and dynamic label
   allocation protocols like LDP would significantly increase the ONUs'
   cost as they influences both hardware and software.  Besides coding
   and maintenance of these new protocols, a much powerful CPU and more
   memory are also necessary for them to run smoothly.

   As there is no redundant link between each ONU and the OLT, routing
   and path selection are not necessary between the ONUs and the OLT.
   This can greatly reduce the cost of an ONU when it acts as a PW T-PE
   node.  Therefore, static provision of PW labels between ONUs and the
   OLT is preferred.  However, if PW labels on ONUs are provisioned
   directly by a Network Management System , a network manager is
   required to touch each ONU once for each PW, and there may be very
   many PWs.  This brings a large amount of operational effort.
   Additionally, there must be a concern that the configuration at the
   ONU and the OLT will be inconsistent because for any PW, both the ONU
   and the OLT must be configured.

   According to ITU-T [G.984.4amd2] and [G.988], the GPON management
   protocol called the ONT Management and Control Interface (OMCI) can
   also be used to configure PWs on a ONU.  OMCI is a prerequisite
   protocol for all GPON systems.  Using OMCI to configure PWs on an ONU
   doesn't require an upgrade to an ONU's hardware and the cost of
   additional coding is negligible.  This provides a way of reducing the
   cost and complexity of provisioning static PWs in GPON.

   This document shows how the two technologies (PON and PSN) can be
   combined to provide an end-to-end multi-segment MPLS PW.  The MPLS-
   PWs are carried by the PSN as defined in [RFC3985].  The OLT and ONU
   perform penultimate hop popping (PHP) when sending packets to each
   other, and there is no MPLS LSP labels are used between them.  MPLS-
   PWs are carried directly by GPON link layer according to ITU-T
   [G.984.3amd1].  There is no change to the operation of MPLS PWs.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Although this document is not a protocol specification, this
   convention is adopted for clarity of description of requirements.


3.  Terminology

   The terminology specified in [RFC3985] and [RFC5659] applies.  In
   addition, we defined the following terms related with PON according
   to ITU-T [G.984.1]:

   o  Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (GPON): A variant of the
      Passive Optical Network (PON) access technology supporting
      transmission rates in excess of 1Gbps and based on the ITU-T G.984
      series of Recommendations.

   o  GPON Encapsulation Method (GEM).  A data frame transport scheme
      used in GPON systems that is connection-oriented and that supports
      fragmentation of the user data frames into variable sized
      transmission fragments.

   o  GEM Port.  An abstraction on GPON adaptation layer representing a
      logical connection associated with a specific client packet flow
      between the OLT and the ONU.

   o  Optical Distribution network (ODN).  In the PON context, a tree of
      optical fibers in the access network, supplemented with power or
      wavelength splitters, filters, or other passive optical devices.

   o  Optical Line Termination (OLT).  A device that terminates the
      common (root) endpoint of an ODN, implements a PON protocol, such
      as that defined by ITU-T G.984 series, and adapts PON PDUs for
      uplink communications over the provider service interface.  The
      OLT provides management and maintenance functions for the
      subtended ODN and ONUs.  In this draft, OLT is actually a network
      element with multiple PON ports and uplinks.

   o  Optical Network Termination (ONT).  A single subscriber device
      that terminates any one of the distributed (leaf) endpoints of an
      ODN, implements a PON protocol, and adapts PON PDUs to subscriber
      service interfaces.  An ONT is a special case of an ONU.

Internet-Draft                  MS-PW-PON                   October 2010


   o  Optical Network Unit (ONU).  A generic term denoting a device that
      terminates any one of the distributed (leaf) endpoints of an ODN,
      implements a PON protocol, and adapts PON PDUs to subscriber
      service interfaces.  In some contexts, an ONU implies a multiple
      subscriber device.

   o  ONT management and control interface (OMCI).  The management and
      control channel between OLT and ONT in PON.  The OMCI protocol
      runs across a GEM connection between the OLT Controller and the
      ONT Controller that is established at ONT initialization.  The
      OMCI protocol is asymmetric: the Controller in the OLT is the
      master and the one in the ONT is the slave.  A single OLT
      Controller using multiple instances of the protocol over separate
      control channels may control multiple ONTs.  The OMCI protocol is
      used to manage the ONT in areas of configuration, fault,
      performance and security.

   o  Passive Optical Network (PON).  An OLT connected using an ODN to
      one or more ONUs or ONTs.


4.  Multi-Segment Pseudowire over PON Network Reference Model

   [RFC5659] provides several pseudowire emulation edge-to-edge (PWE3)
   reference architectures for the multi-segment case.  These are
   general models extended from [RFC3985] to enable point-to-point
   pseudowires through multiple PSN tunnels.

   A Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network consists of an Optical Line
   Termination (OLT), an Optical Distribution Network (ODN) and multiple
   Optical Network Units (ONU).  The ODN is actually a fiber tree that
   provides physical connections between the OLT and the ONUs.  GPON has
   its own physical layer and link layer.  GEM Port is a logical point-
   to-point connection between the OLT and each ONU over GPON
   Transmission Convergence (GTC) layer.  There could be more than one
   GEM port between the OLT and an ONU.  Each GEM port could be assigned
   different QoS and bandwidth.

             Figure B: MS-PW over PON Network Reference Model

   The network is partitioned into an access segment and a metro/core
   segment with a hub and spoke topology.  A MS-PW can be used when
   extending the PW technology to ONUs.  This removes the need for a
   full mesh or routers.  It also minimizes the number of PSN tunnels
   and signaling adjacencies terminating on T-PEs and reduces the
   routing information processed by T-PEs.  Thus it can enhance the
   scalability and lower the complexity of the network.  The OLT acts as
   an S-PE so that PWs can be optimized within each segment.

   Figure B applies the MS-PW architecture in a network comprising a PON
   and a PSN, and shows the specific technology usage.  The Terminating
   PE1 (T-PE1) is an Optical Network Unit (ONU), while the Switching PE1
   (S-PE1) is an Optical Line Termination (OLT) node.  The OLT performs
   penultimate hop popping and removes the MPLS LSP label when
   forwarding packets to the ONU (T-PE1).  When sending packets from ONU
   (T-PE1) to OLT, the ONU also performs PHP.  Therefore, PWs are
   carried by GEM ports directly between ONU (T-PE1) and OLT (S-PE)
   across Optical Distribution Network (ODN).

   It should be noted that all PW segments are of the same technology,
   which is packet encapsulated.


5.  MS-PW in PON for Mobile Backhaul

   As stated in [RFC5254], when a TDM access network is replaced with a
   packet-based infrastructure, initiating PWs closer to the end-user
   and converging multiple services onto a single access network may



Zheng, et al.            Expires April 28, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  MS-PW-PON                   October 2010


   reduce expenses.  Backhauling 2G Base Stations (BS) by a packet
   network is a typical use case that may benefit from moving pseudowire
   PEs closer to the end-user and requires pseudowires to be extended
   into the access network.  If the access network is a PON, pseudowires
   are expected to extend to Optical Network Units (ONUs).  Mobile
   services are backhauled from base stations all the way back to a
   mobile network Controller via pseudowires.  PEs are attached by base
   stations and the Controller on both ends respectively.  This means
   each ONU acts as an edge PE that terminates attachment circuits (ACs)
   from base stations, and encapsulates native data in them to
   pseudowires.

   MS-PW is particularly preferred in this case according to [RFC5659],
   as an edge PE (connected to the Controller) terminates N PWs to/from
   N different remote PEs (connected to base stations), which attach to
   a single intermediate PE.  The intermediate PE switches PWs In the
   network depicted in figure A, CE1 is the base station and CE2 is the
   controller.  ONUs are PW Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE) where
   Access Circuits are attached, while OLT is the PW Switching Provider
   Edge (S-PE).

   A PON is a network with a tree topology that fits the infrastructure
   described above.  The OLT aggregates a large number of ONUs, which
   terminate ACs from base stations.  For economic reasons, ONUs are
   built to be low cost and without powerful routing or IP capabilities.
   The cost of ONUs will evidently increase if they are required to
   support similar PW setup and maintenance mechanisms as that used in
   the core network.  Multi-segment PW enables PW in PON to use a
   different setup mechanism than that in the metro and core network,
   with the OLT performing an intermediate PE switching PWs between ONUs
   and the Controller.  For example, the core could use a dynamic
   control plane (T-LDP PWs over RSVP-TE tunnels), while the access
   network could be provisioned through the management plane using the
   Network Management Station.


6.  Label Provisioning for Pseudowires over PON

   In a PON with MS-PW, where the OLT acts as a switching point and the
   ONU as a PE, provision of PWs between the OLT and the ONU may be
   performed through static configuration, e.g. from a NMS.  However, it
   incurs heavy burden of management if each ONU has to be touched to
   set up PW from ONUs to OLT and configure forwarding information on
   ONUs.  The huge number of ONUs makes this method quite forbidding.

   Using a management protocol over PON to provision pseudowire labels
   on ONUs largely reduces labor of static label configuration, while
   keeping simplicity of ONU by not implementing a dynamic control



Zheng, et al.            Expires April 28, 2011                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                  MS-PW-PON                   October 2010


   plane.

   Thanks to the management protocol in GPON system, ONT management and
   control interface (OMCI), a semi-static mechanism could be used to
   set up PWs from ONUs to OLT.  OMCI, running between the OLT and the
   ONUs, is the channel that OLT manages and controls ONUs.  All GPON
   physical layer and data GTC layer configuration on ONUs are installed
   via OMCI.  It also has the capability to configure MPLS-PW labels and
   related forwarding information on ONUs per ITU-T [G.984.4amd2] and
   [G.988].  When using OMCI to provision PWs on ONU, the network
   manager only needs to send all configurations to the OLT, which will
   send all parameters to ONUs automatically through OMCI.  There is no
   need to touch each ONU.

   OMCI now supports configuration of variant types of PWs, e.g.  TDM,
   ATM and Ethernet.  Besides, OMCI can act as a signalling mechanism
   between ONU and OLT, which enables the ONU to notify AC status to
   OLT.


7.  MPLS-PW  in PON network

   Expanding PW to the ONU requires some form of routing hierarchy.  The
   approach taken here is to divide the network into access segments and
   Metro/Core segments.  The OLT is the interconnecting point of Hub and
   Spokes.  Spoke tunnels locate PSNs or GPON in the access segment are
   spoke tunnels, while hub tunnels PSNs locate in the core segment are

          Figure C: Protocol Stacks on OLT for PWE3 over GEM Port

   As ONU and OLT performs PHP when sending packets to each other, there
   is no MPLS LSP label needed between them.  PWs are carried directly

   over GEM Ports.  According to ITU-T [G.984.3amd1], MPLS-PW can be
   carried by GEM Port.  Figure C illustrates protocol stacks of GPON
   ONU and OLT where MPLS-PW is carried directly by GEM Ports.

   Multiple GEM Ports are supported for each pair of OLT and ONU, which
   enables multiple PSNs for each ONU.  According to current GPON system
   specification, one GPON port supports maximum 4096 GEM Ports shared
   by all ONUs connected to it.  One GPON port can aggregate maximum 64
   ONUs, but typically no more than 8 ONUs for bandwidth reason, when
   the ONU is a Multi-Dwelling Unit (MDU) or a Multi-Tenant Unit (MTU)
   that serves multiple subscribers.  There should be no scalability
   problem for GEM Ports to carry MPLS-PWs between ONU and OLT.

   When backhauling TDM services in a packet network, almost 50% of
   payload are shorter than 64 bytes.  Reducing protocol stacks and
   overhead of packets can obviously improve transmission efficiency.

   Besides the simplified protocol stacks described in this section,
   other PSN technologies are also valid to transmit PWs in GPON.


8.  IANA Considerations

   No new options or messages are defined in this document.


9.  Security Considerations

   GPON has its own security mechanism to guarantee each ONU are
   isolated on GPON link layer.  There are no other security issues
   concerned.
