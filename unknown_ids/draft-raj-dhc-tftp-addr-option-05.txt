Internet-Draft  VoIP Configuration Server Address Option    January 2009


Abstract

   This memo documents existing usage for the "VoIP Configuration Server
   Address Option" (previously known as the "TFTP Server IP Address
   Option").  The option number currently in use is 150.  This memo
   documents the current usage of the option in agreement with RFC 3942
   [RFC3942], which declares that any pre-existing usages of option
   numbers in the range 128 - 223 should be documented and the working
   group will try to officially assign those numbers to those options.

Internet-Draft  VoIP Configuration Server Address Option    January 2009


1.  Introduction

   Voice over IP ("VoIP") devices, such as IP phones, have a need to
   download their configuration from a configuration server on the
   network.  There are commonly accepted methods to discover this server
   via DHCP; the "sname" field in the DHCP header [RFC2131], the "TFTP
   Server name" option (#66) [RFC2132].  Both of these sources of
   information, however, contain the TFTP server's hostname.  That
   hostname must then be translated to an IP address.  The usual method
   to accomplish this would be DNS [RFC1034].  This means the firmware
   in a VoIP device (with possibly limited flash, memory, and/or
   processing resources) would need to implement the DNS protocol in
   order to perform this translation.  This would also introduce an
   additional unnecessary point of failure whereby the device is
   dependent on the DNS server infrastructure in order to boot up and
   communicate with its call agent.

   In order to eliminate DNS as a point of failure and keep the firmware
   in such a VoIP device to a minimum the "VoIP Configuration Server
   Address" option (150) was introduced.  This option allows the DHCP
   server to pass one or more IP addresses of the VoIP Configuration
   Server(s) instead of the hostname, thus making the information
   directly usable by the VoIP device.

   Other reasons for this option are that, (1) the "siaddr" field is not
   configurable on some DHCP servers, (2) the "siaddr" field only allows
   for one IPv4 address and it is desirable to have the ability to
   configure multiple IP addresses for redundancy, (3) some DHCP servers
   have been found to fill in their own IPv4 address as siaddr, (4) some
   customers were already using the "siaddr" field for other purposes,
   and finally (5) the configuration server may use a protocol other
   than TFTP to serve configuration files, making the use of the "TFTP
   Server name" opion (#66) in inappropriate.

   In cases where other download server address information also appears
   in the response packet, such as "sname" and "TFTP Server name", it is
   left to the device to decide which piece of information to use.

3.  VoIP Configuration Server Address Option Definition

   The VoIP Configuration Server Address option is a DHCP option
   [RFC2132].  The option contains one or more IPv4 addresses of the
   VoIP Configuration Server which the client MAY use.

   The format of the option is:

    Code   Len   IPv4 Configuration Server Address(es)
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   | 150 |  n  |     IPv4 address      | ...
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+


                                 Figure 1

   The option minimum length (n) is 4.

   The "Len" field must specify a length which is an integral multiple
   of 4 octets (4, 8, 12, etc.).  If an option is received where this is
   not the case, the option information SHOULD be ignored.  Dividing
   this "Len" value by 4 will give number of IPv4 VoIP Configuration
   Server addresses which are specified in the option.

   The option SHOULD NOT be specified by the DHCP Client as it is
   intended only to be returned from the DHCP Server.  If the DHCP
   Client wants to receive this information from the server, it SHOULD
   include the number 150 in the DHCP "Parameter List" option (55).

   Server addresses SHOULD be listed in order of preference.

   The client may use as many or as few of the addresses provided.  For
   example, if client is only capable of accepting 2 configuration
   server addresses, it may ignore any other addresses provided after
   the second address.  A client SHOULD accept an offer that contains
   more addresses than it is capable of utilizing and ignore those that
   it is not capable of using.

4.  Security Considerations

   A rogue DHCP Server could use this option in order to coerce a Client
   into downloading configuration from an alternate Configuration Server
   and thus gain control of the device's configuration.  This, however,
   is no more of a security threat than similar attacks using other DHCP
   options which specify server names or addresses, of which there are
   many.  If this is a concern, then DHCP Authentication may be used.
   Another method of addressing this security threat would be the use of
   encryption, authentication keys, or even certificates, as part of the
   configuration data itself and which are tied to the device which is
   downloading the configuration.  In other words, there are various
   methods to ensure the integrity of configuration data independent
   from insuring the integrity of the this DHCP option or even DHCP
   itself.

   Message authentication in DHCP for intradomain use where the out-of-
   band exchange of a shared secret is feasible is defined in [RFC3118].
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP
   protocol specification in [RFC2131].

   Other out-of-band methods of verifying the validity of the VoIP
   Configuration Server Address, such as certificates of trust, could be
   used to mitigate some security concerns.
