      Managing the Use of Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address
                       Autoconfiguration in IPv6
             draft-gont-6man-managing-privacy-extensions-00

Abstract

   This document describes an operational problem that arises due to the
   impossibility of managing the use of "Privacy Extensions" for IPv6
   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) in network scenarios that
   employ SLAAC.  Additionally, this document specifies new flag in the
   Prefix Information option of Router Advertisement messages, such that
   routers can advertise, for each network prefix to be used for SLAAC,
   whether the aforementioned "Privacy Extensions" should be used.

Internet-Draft         Managing Privacy Addresses             March 2011


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4862] specifies the Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
   for IPv6, which typically results in hosts configuring one or more
   addresses composed of a network prefix advertised by a local router,
   and an Interface Identifier (IID) derived from a hardware address
   (such as an Ethernet MAC address).

   Since e.g.  Ethernet MAC addresses are typically globally unique,
   IPv6 addresses generated as specified in [RFC4862] could possibly be
   levareged to track and correlate the activity of a node, thus
   negatively affecting the privacy of users.

   The "Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in
   IPv6" [RFC4941] were introduced difficult the task of eavesdroppers
   and other information collectors to correlate the activities of a
   node, and basically result in random Interface Identifiers which may
   be more difficult to leverage than their hardware-derived
   counterpart.  These "Privacy Extensions" have been implemented in a
   variety of systems, some of which (notably that in Microsoft Windows
   Vista and Microsoft Windows 7) enable them by default.

   The imposibility of managing the use of "Privacy Extensions" poses
   poses a problem when a site has a specific policy for the generation
   of IPv6 Interface Identifiers.  For example, if hosts that enable
   "Privacy Extensions" (by default) need to be deployed on sites that
   require the use of hardware-derived Interface Identifiers, an
   administrator may need to manually disable the use of "Privacy
   Extensions" in each of the attached nodes.  This not only may result
   in a lot of work on the side of the administrator, but may also be
   difficult to implement (particularly when considering mobile
   computers such as laptops) [Broersma].  On the other hand, in some
   environments (e.g., a typical home network) the use of "Privacy
   Extensions" might be desirable.  However, the imposibility to
   automatically enable "Privacy Extensions" may preclude their use
   (unless they are manually enabled by the administrator).

   This document specifies a new flag in the Prefix Information option
   of Router Advertisement messages, such that routers can advertise,
   for each network prefix to be used for SLAAC, whether the
   aforementioned "Privacy Extensions" should be used.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Updating the Prefix Information option

   The syntax of the Prefix Information option is updated as follows:


      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                                                               |
     +                                                               +
     |                                                               |
     +                            Prefix                             +
     |                                                               |
     +                                                               +
     |                                                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   An additional bit, "H" ("Hardware-derived addresses"), is specified
   for the Prefix Information option.  When set, this bit indicates that
   hardware-derived addresses SHOULD be used when configuring IPv6
   addresses as a result of Stateless Address Autoconfiguration.  When
   not set, this bit indicates that Privacy Extensions SHOULD be enabled
   when configuring IPv6 addresses as a result of Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration

      The "R" bit was specified by [RFC3775].  The Rsvd1 field
      corresponds to the remaining reserved bits, and thus MUST be set
      to zero by the sender of this option, and ignored by the receiver.

   Since the "H" bit was a previously reserved field, implementations
   that predate this specification should be setting this bit to zero
   when sending the option, and ignoring this bit upon receipt.

   The following table illustrates the result of SLAAC depending on
   whether this specification is supported by the router and/or the host
   participanting in SLAAC.

3.  Alternative: REQUEST FOR COMMENTS

   If rather than specifying an "H" bit, our I-D were to specify a "P"
   ("Privacy addresses") bit, the resulting possible scenarios would
   change as follows:

   The following table illustrates the result of SLAAC depending on
   whether this specification is supported at the router and/or host
   participanting in SLAAC.

   +---------------+---------------------------+-----------------------+
   | Router / Host |         Supported         |       Supported       |
   +---------------+---------------------------+-----------------------+
   |   Supported   |  As indicated by the "P"  |     As in current     |
   |               |            bit            |       scenarios       |
   +---------------+---------------------------+-----------------------+
   |   Supported   |      Hardware-derived     |     As in current     |
   |               |         addresses         |       scenarios       |
   +---------------+---------------------------+-----------------------+

             Table 2: Alt. Possible results of SLAAC scenarios

   As you may see, in this case only one scenario changes: when this
   spec is not supported by the router, but *is* supported by the host,
   hardware addresses are used.  This would mean that if e.g.  MS were
   to implement this spec before e.g.  Cisco, Privacy Addresses would be
   disabled.

   Clearly, there's a tradeoff here.  Comments?  Thoughts?

4.  Security Considerations

   An attacker could exploit the mechanism specified in this document to
   cause hosts in a given subnet to disable Privacy Extensions, thus
   causing their Interface Identifiers to be derived from hardware
   addresses, instead.  Thus, the privacy of the victim hosts that would
   have enabled the Privacy Extensions could possibly be reduced.

   However, it should be noted that this attack would require from an
   attacker the same effort as all the other Neighbor Discovery attack
   vectors that are based on crafted Router Advertisement messages, most
   of which are far more interesting for an attacker than this possible
   attack vector.

   Among the possible options for mitigating this and other attack
   vectors based on crafted Router Advertisement messages is the
   deployment of the so-called "Router Advertisement guard" mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ra-guard].

   SEND (SEcure Neighbor Discovery) [RFC3971] could be pontentially
   deployed to mitigate most Neighbor Discovery attacks.  However, a
   number of issues (such as the requirement for Public Key
   Infrastructure) preclude the deployment of SEND in most general
   network scenarions.  [CPNI-IPv6]

   Finally, we note that while the value and effectiveness of privacy
   addreses have been questioned in a number of studies
   [I-D.dupont-ipv6-rfc3041harmful] [Escudero] [CPNI-IPv6], this
   document does not take a stance about their value and effectiveness:
   it limits itself to discussing the operational problem that arises
   due to the impossibility of managing the use of "Privacy Extensions",
   and updating the "Prefix Information" option such that "Privacy
   Extensions" can be more easily managed when IPv6 Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) is employed.
