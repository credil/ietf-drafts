Internet-Draft              BFD Gap Analysis                  April 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document performs a gap analysis of the current state of BFD
   [RFC5880] according to the requirements of
   [I-D.ietf-karp-design-guide].  Previously, the OPSEC working group
   has provided an analysis of cryptographic issues with BFD in
   [RFC6039].

   The existing BFD specifications provide a very initial security
   solution.  Key ID is provided so that the key used in securing a
   packet can be changed on demand.  Two cryptographic algorithms (MD5
   and SHA-1) are supported for Integrity protection of the control
   packets; the algorithms are both demonstrated to be subject to
   collision attacks.  While these attacks will not necessarily affect
   BFD, other routing protocols like RIPv2 [RFC4822], IS-IS [RFC5310]
   and OSPFv2 [RFC5709] have moved to stronger algorithms and it is
   imperative that BFD also does that as it does not make much sense to
   secure these routing protocols with a stronger authentication
   algorithm if BFD continues using a weaker security algorithm.

   While BFD uses a non-decreasing per-packet sequence number to protect
   itself from intra-connection replay attacks, it still leaves the
   protocol vulnerable to the inter-session replay attacks.

2.  Requirements to Meet

   There are several requirements described in section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-karp-threats-reqs] that BFD does not currently meet:

      Replay Protection: BFD provides an incomplete intra-session and no
      inter-session replay attack protection; this creates significant
      denial-of-service opportunities.

      Strong Algorithms: the cryptographic algorithms adopted for
      message authentication in BFD are MD5 or SHA-1 based.  However,
      both algorithms known to be vulnerable to collision attacks.
      [I-D.bhatia-bfd-crypto-auth] proposes a solution to support HMAC
      with the SHA-1 and SHA-2 family of hash functions for BFD.

      DoS Attacks: BFD packets can be sent at millisecond intervals (the
      protocol uses timers at microsecond intervals).  When malicious
      packets are sent at short intervals, with the authentication bit
      set, it can cause a DoS attack.

   The remainder of this document explains the details of how these
   requirements fail to be met and proposes mechanisms for addressing
   them.

3.  Current State

   [RFC5880] describes five authentication mechanisms for the integrity
   protection of BFD control packets: Simple Password, Keyed MD5
   [RFC1321], Meticulous Keyed MD5, Keyed SHA-1 and Meticulous SHA-1.
   In the simple password mechanism, every control packet is associated
   with a password transported in plain text; attacks eavesdropping the
   network traffic can easily learn the password and compromise the
   security of the corresponding BFD session.  In the Keyed MD5 and the
   Meticulous Keyed MD5 mechanisms, BFD nodes use share secret keys to
   generate keyed MD5 digests for control packets.  Similarly, in the
   Keyed SHA-1 and the Meticulous Keyed SHA-1 mechanisms, BFD nodes use
   shared secret keys to generate keyed SHA-1 digests for control
   packets.  Note that in the keyed authentication mechanisms, every BFD
   control packet is associated with a non-decreasing 32-bit sequence
   number to resist replay attacks.  In the Keyed MD5 and the Keyed
   SHA-1 mechanisms, the sequence member is only required to increase
   occasionally.  However, in the Meticulous Keyed MD5 and the
   Meticulous Keyed SHA-1 mechanisms, the sequence member is required to
   monotonically increase with each succesive packet.

   Additionally, limited key updating functionality is provided.  There
   is a Key ID in every authenticated BFD control packet, indicating the
   key used to hash the packet.  However, there is no mechanism
   described to provide a smooth key rollover that the BFD routers can
   use when moving from one key to the other.

   It is common to send BFD packets at microsecond and millisecond
   intervals.  Since the cryptographic sequence number space is only 32
   bits, it will not take very long for the sequence space to reach its
   maximum value and roll over.  This can result in potential inter-
   session replay attacks.  This exacerbates when BFD uses the
   meticulous authentication mode.

   In a BFD session, each nodes needs to select a 32-bit discriminator
   to identify itself.  Therefore, a BFD session is identified by two
   discriminators.  If a node will randomly select a new discriminator
   for a new session and use authentication mechanism to secure the
   control packets, inter-session replay attacks can be mitigated to
   some extent.  However, in existing BFD demultiplexing mechanisms, the
   discriminators used in a new BFD session may be predicable.  This
   issue may be taken advantage of by attackers to perform replay
   attacks.

   BFD allows a mode called the echo mode.  Echo packets are not defined
   in the BFD specification, though they can keep the BFD session up.
   The format of the echo packet is local to the sending side and there
   are no guidelines on the properties of these packets beyond the

   choice of the source and destination addresses.  While the BFD
   specification recommends applying security mechanisms to prevent
   spoofing of these packets, there are no guidelines on what type of
   mechanisms are appropriate.

4.  Impacts of BFD Replays

   As discussed, BFD cannot meet the requirements of inter-session or
   intra-session replay protection.  This section discusses the impacts
   of BFD replays.

   When cryptographic authentication mechanisms are adopted for BFD, a
   non-decreasing 32-bit long sequence number is used.  In the Keyed MD5
   and the Keyed SHA-1 mechanisms, the sequence member is not required
   to increase for every packet.  Therefore an attacker can keep
   replaying the packets with the latest sequence number until the
   sequence number is updated.  This issue is eliminated in the
   Meticulous Keyed MD5 and the Meticulous Keyed SHA-1 mechanisms.
   However, note that a sequence number may reach its maximum and be
   rolled over in a session.  In this case, without the support from a
   automatic key management mechanism, the BFD session will be
   vulnerable to replay attacks performed by sending the packets before
   the roll over of the sequence number.  Because the BFD specification
   allows for the change of authentication state based on the state of a
   received packet, an elaborately selected replayed packet can cause a
   serious denial-of-service attack.  For instance, an attacker can
   replay a packet in which the sequence number is much larger than the
   current one to convince a node that large amount of packets has been
   lost.  As a result, the victim will transfer its state to down.

   BFD does not provide any solution to deal with inter-session replay
   attacks.  Although discriminators can potentially be used to
   challenge the aliveness of node on the other side of new BFD session,
   The method of demultiplexing the initial packets is not specified.
   If two subsequent BFD sessions adopt an identical discriminator pair
   and use same cryptographic key to secure the control packets, a
   malicious authenticated packet (stored from the past session) can be
   used to perform inter-connection replay attacks.

   Any security issues in the BFD echo mode will directly affect the BFD
   protocol and session states, and hence the network stability.  For
   instance, any replay attacks would be indistinguishable from normal
   forwarding of the tested router.  An attack would still cause a
   faulty link to be believed to be up, but there is little that can be
   done about it.  However, if the echo packets are guessable, it may be
   possible to spoof from an external source and cause BFD to believe
   that a one-way link is really bidirectional.  As a result, it is
   important that the echo packets contain random material that is also
   checked upon reception.
