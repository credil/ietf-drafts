1.  Introduction

   The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extension
   related to Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON) has to cope
   with the bidirectional LSP issue.

   The [RFC3471] and [RFC3473] define the functional framework and
   encoding for bidirectional LSP setup.  The presence of an Upstream
   Label Object (UL) during the signaling phase means that the LSP
   request is bidirectional and it also identifies the label to be used
   in the reverse direction.

   In the WSON [I-D.draft-ietf-ccamp-rwa-wson-framework] context the bi-
   directionality might appear as a strong requirement due to current
   available DWDM technology.  The bidirectional LSP does not strictly
   require using the same wavelength in the two directions; however this
   could be a constrain in to the deployed network even if it can be
   relaxed if the technology supports it.

   In extending signaling to WSON requirements the following ID
   [I-D.bernstein-ccamp-wson-signaling] explain a procedure regarding
   the signaling of a bidirectional LSP.

   The currently defined signaling extensions handle the setup of the
   upstream channel in the context of the downstream LSP session by
   adding additional objects to the request and requiring special node
   behaviors.  This approach has some limitations in specific scenarios:

   o  when path characteristics must be collected from source to
      destination (e.g. the optical signal parameters) as only the
      downstream direction can be evaluated

   o  when some (transit) nodes in the network do not support the
      extensions

   o  when the same wavelength selection is requested for the upstream
      and downstream directions and the distributed wavelength
      assignment is implemented

   This memo is to define an operational procedure that exploits the bi-
   directionality with minimum requirements in term of protocol
   extensions and introducing a synchronization among the two signaling
   phases.  The memo also review some advantages and disadvantages in
   term of optical lightpath.

2.  Information Required

   To set up a bidirectional LSP in a WSON environment we need to
   identify the information required.  Some information is already
   defined in standards like [RFC3473], others might be identified as
   specific to WSON.

   For the current purpose we identify the following information that
   need to be carried along the signaling phase:

   o  LSP bi-directionality.  According to [RFC3471] the Upstream Label
      Object presence is a trigger for bi-directionality.

   o  Wavelength Bi-directionality.  In some specific cases the network
      might require the same wavelength used in both directions.


3.  Bi-Directional Signalling Procedure

3.1.  Synchronized Signaling Steps

   The Bidirectional signaling is implemented through two independent
   signaling sessions (one for each direction) that are performed in
   synch keeping the upstream signaling nested in the downstream one.
   In this description we use the terms 'source' and 'destination'
   referring to the first request issued (downstream).  For the upstream
   direction the destination is the node emitting the PATH and source
   the one emitting the RESV.

   1.  The source node signals a PATH request to the destination node
       for the downstream channel.

   2.  The Destination may apply any path validation procedure to asses
       the path feasibility.

   3.  The destination node signals a PATH request to the source node
       for the upstream channel with the path constrained by the ERO to
       use the same path as the downstream channel and, if requested, an
       initial LABEL_SET Object specifying the wavelengths available for
       the downstream LSPs (e.g. if the same wavelength is required for
       both direction).

   4.  The source node signals the RESV for the upstream channel to the
       destination node.  The channel cross-connections are setup in the
       nodes.

   5.  The destination node signals the RESV for the downstream channel
       to the source node; if requested, the same wavelength selected by

       the upstream LSPs is signaled.  The channel cross-connections are
       setup in the nodes.

     Message Sequence Chart for bidirectional synchronized LSP setup.

   The Figure 1 shows in a graphical format how the upstream signaling
   phase is nested within the downstream one, where:

      "LSR S" is the source node, "LSR i" is any intermediate node and
      "LSR D" is the destination node

      path-d represents the path signaling phase downstream that has to
      be bidirectional

      path-u represents the path signaling phase upstream

      resv-u represent the reservation phase for upstream

      resv-d represent the reservation phase for downstream

3.2.  Errors and Roll Back

   In case of any error triggered the roll back procedure goes through a
   standard process apart from the processing at the destination node.

   1.  In case of error in the upstream LSP setup in the PATH or RESV
       signaling phase (PATHERR message received by the destination
       node), a PATHERR message is issued for the downstream node.

   2.  In case of error in the downstream RESV signaling phase, a
       PATHTEAR message is issued by the destination node for the
       upstream LSP

3.3.  Advantages and Disadvantages

   The procedure has the following advantages

   o  standard processing of RSVP messages (no additional operations
      performed in the RESV message processing)

   o  no need for ResvConf messages (each channel source point knows
      when the channel is setup by receiving the RESV message)

   o  the symmetrical resource allocation constraint could be removed: a
      different wavelength can be used for the upstream channel (the
      wavelength can be discovered with the usual LABEL_SET object
      management)

   o  in the MIBs (LSP MIB) both the upstream and downstream channel
      resources (labels, in-segment, out-segment) are explicitly
      reported

   We can identify the following disadvantages:

   o  Longer setup time due to double signaling.  This issue however has
      to be evaluated in term of lightpath.  They have slow setup time.

   o  The two LSPs are not explicitly associated in the network nodes;
      only the destination node keeps track of the relation.  Two

      possible options can be foreseen:

      1.  additional info in the RSVP PATH msg with associated LSP Id
          (and direction)

      2.  associating the two LSP (upstream,downstream) to a CALL [RFC
          4974] (even if you then need to signal the CALL too...)


4.  Backward Compatibility Considerations

   A full WSON signaling solution could not be compatible, in this case
   the possibility to reject bidirectional signaling shall be
   implemented (Example in [I-D.bernstein-ccamp-wson-signaling]).


5.  Error management

   Specific Error management for the bidirectional case.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
   for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.


9.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations to [RFC3473].
   GMPLS security is described in section 11 of [RFC3471].
