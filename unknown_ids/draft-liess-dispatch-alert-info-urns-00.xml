			<t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to
      provide a reference to the alternative ringback tone (RBT) for caller,
      or ring tone (RT) for callee using the Alert-Info header. However, the
      reference addresses only the network resources with specific rendering
      properties. There is currently no support for predefined standard
      identifiers for ringback tones or semantic indications without tied
      rendering. To overcome this limitations and support new applications a
      family of the URNs is defined in this specification.</t>
		</abstract>
		<note title="Requirements Language">
			<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>
      allows for user agent servers (UAS) and proxies to provide the specific
      ringback or ring tone to the user agent (UA). In RFC 3261 this is done
      by including a URI reference in the Alert-Info header field, that points
      to the tone. The URI reference is most commonly the HTTP URI to the
      audio file. On the receipt of the Alert-Info header the user agent may
      fetch the referenced ringback or ring tone and play it to the user.</t>
			<t>This mechanism does not ensure interoperability when there is no
      common understanding of the referenced content (different countries or
      vendors, hearing impaired) or when the user wants his own tones
      configured in the end device. If caller and callee are from the
      different countries, the understanding of the tones may vary
      significantly. Hearing impaired users may not sense the specific tone if
      it is provided as an audio file. The tone per se is also not useful for
      automata.</t>
			<t>There are currently interoperability issues around the use of the
      Alert-Info header field when not-using an external ring file. For
      example, consider the PBX special ringtone for an external (to the PBX)
      caller. Different vendors use different approaches such as: Alert-Info:
      &lt;file://ring.pcm&gt;;alert=normal where ring.pcm is a dummy file or:
      Alert-Info: &lt;file://normal.ring.pcm&gt; or: Alert-Info:
      &lt;sip:normal-ringtone@example.com&gt; As a result, Alert-Info
      currently only works when the same vendor provides proxy and UA, as only
      then is the same "fake" proprietary URI convention is used.</t>
			<t>Another limitation of the current solution is that the referenced
      tones are tied to particular rendering. It is not possible to provide a
      semantic indication that signals the intent and allows the recipient to
      decide how to render the received information in an appropriate way.</t>
			<t>To solve the described issues, this specification defines the new URN
      namespace 'alert' for the Alert-Info header that can be understood by an
      automaton, would allow for programmatic handling including user
      interface adaptation, or conversion to equivalent protocol parameters in
      the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) when the client is a
      gateway. The work to standardize an Alert-Info URN will increase SIP
      interoperability for this header field by replacing proprietary
      conventions.</t>
			<t>Using 'alert' namespace provides syntax for several different
      application spaces:<list style="symbols">
					<t>Names for services such as call waiting or automatic callback,
          not tied to any particular rendering.</t>
					<t>Names for common ring-tones generated by PBX phone for cases such
          as an internal enterprise caller, external caller, ringback after a
          transfer failure or expiration of a hold timer, etc.</t>
					<t>Names for country-specific tones.</t>
					<t>Names for things with specific renderings that aren't purely
          audio. They might be static icons, video sequences, text, etc.</t>
				</list></t>
			<t>Some advantages of a URN rather than a URI reference to a
      downloadable resource:</t>
			<t><list style="symbols">
					<t>Do not need to download it or deal with security issues
          associated with dereferencing.</t>
					<t>No formatting or compatibility issues.</t>
					<t>No security risk of rendering something unexpected and
          undesirable.</t>
					<t>The tone can be stored locally in whatever format and at whatever
          quality level is appropriate, because it is specified "by name"
          rather than "by value".</t>
					<t>It is easier to make policy decisions about whether to use it or
          not.</t>
					<t>It facilitates translation for the hearing impaired.</t>
				</list>The downside is that if the recipient does not understand the
      URN then it will only be able to render a default ringback or ring-tone.
      To provide the general awareness about the Alert-Info URNs this document
      provides IANA template for registering the URNs and defines several
      typical identifiers.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Requirements">
			<t>This section discusses the requirements for an identifier to
      transport the semantic of a specific ring or ringback tone.</t>
			<t>REQ-1: The mechanism will allow user agents (UAs) and proxies to o
      provide a semantic indication in the Alert-Info SIP-header that signals
      the intent of the rendering and allows the recipient to decide how to
      render the received information.</t>
			<t>REQ-2: The mechanism will allow to ensure interoperability for
      services as call waiting, forward, call forwarding, transfer-recall,
      auto-callback, hold-recall, crisis.</t>
			<t>REQ-3: The mechanism will allow to render common PBX ring tone
      types.</t>
			<t>REQ-4: The mechanism will allow to render specific country ring- and
      busy-tones.</t>
			<t>REQ-5: The mechanism will allow to render tones for emergency
      alerts.</t>
			<t>REQ-6: The mechanism will allow rendering using other means than
      tones, e.g. text or images.</t>
			<t>REQ-7: The mechanism will allow rendering to be semantic, not biased
      towards a a particular representation which might not be suitable for
      all devices or users.</t>
			<t>REQ-7: The mechanism will allow to store the actual encoding locally
      rather than fetching it.</t>
			<t>REQ-9: The mechanism will allow the identifier to be specified "by
      name" rather than "by value", to enable local policy decisions whether
      to use it or not .</t>
			<t>REQ-10: The mechanism will be flexible and can be used for use cases
      not described in this specification .</t>
			<t>REQ-11: The mechanism will allow transmission in SIP requests and
      responses.</t>

					<t>The Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the "alert" URNs is
          called alert-identifier and has a hierarchical structure. The
          left-most label is called "alert-category" and is separated from
          right-side of the alert-identifier, the alert-indication, by a
          semicolon. In this specification, two categories of
          alert-identifiers are described: the "tone" alert-identifiers and
          the "service" alert-identifiers.</t>
					<t>The "tone" alert-identifier has the general form:</t>
					<list>
						<t>urn:alert:tone:{tone-indication}</t>
					</list>
					<t>where the tone-indication identifies the semantic of a tone.</t>
					<t/>
					<t style="hanging">The "service" alert-identifier has the general
          form:</t>
					<list>
						<t>urn:alert:service:{service-indication}</t>
					</list>
					<t>where the service-indication is a unique identifier for a service
          as call-waiting or transfer-recall.</t>
					<t>The tone-indication and service-indication are hierarchical
          identifiers, consisting of one label or a sequence of labels
          separated by periods. The left-most label is the most significant
          one and is called 'top-level indication' , while names to the right
          are called 'sub-indication'. The set of allowable characters is the
          same as that for domain names <xref target="RFC1123"/>. Labels are
          case-insensitive, but MUST be specified in all lower-case.</t>
					<t>Labels can be removed right-to-left excepting the left-most
          label; the resulting tone-indication or service-indication is still
          valid, referring to a more generic tone-indication or
          service-indication. In other words, if a tone 'x.y.z' exists, the
          tones 'x' and 'x.y' are also valid tones. Each alert indication
          identifier SHALL explicitly define it's validity respective the
          sub-indications.</t>

					<t hangText="Relevant ancillary documentation:">None</t>
					<t hangText="Community considerations:">The alert URN is believed to
          be relevant to a large cross-section of Internet users, including
          both technical and non-technical users, on a variety of devices and
          with a variety of perception capabilities. The 'alert' URN will
          allow Internet users to receive more information and enable them to
          better make decisions about accepting an offered call, or get better
          feedback on the progress of a call they have made. User interfaces
          for the perception impaired users can better render the ringback
          indication based on the 'alert' URN. The assignment of identifiers
          is described in <xref target="IANA"/>. The 'alert' URN does not
          prescribe a particular resolution mechanism, but it is assumed that
          a number of different entities could operate and offer such
          mechanisms.</t>
					<t hangText="Namespace considerations:">There do not appear to be
          other URN namespaces that serve the same need of uniquely
          identifying 'alert' communication and information services.</t>
					<t hangText="Identifier uniqueness considerations:">An 'alert' URN
          identifies a logical service or tone, specified in the 'alert'
          indication registration (see <xref target="IANA"/>). Resolution of
          the registered URN will return a particular instance of the alert
          identifier. Alert identifier URNs MUST be unique for each unique
          indication; this is guaranteed through the registration of each
          alert indication within this namespace, described in <xref target="IANA"/>.</t>
					<t hangText="Identifier persistence considerations:">The 'alert' URN
          for the same indication is expected to be persistent, as long as it
          is registered with IANA.</t>
					<t hangText="Process of identifier assignment:">The process of
          identifier assignment is described in <xref target="IANA"/>.</t>

					<t hangText="Rules for lexical equivalence:">'alert' URNs are

					<t hangText="Conformance with URN syntax:">The BNF in the

			<t>This section describes the use cases that are supported by the
      'alert' URNs.</t>
			<section anchor="PBX_Tones" title="PBX Tones">
				<t>This section defines some commonly encountered ring-tones on PBX or
        business phones. They are as follows:</t>
				<section title="normal">
					<t>This tone indicates that the default or normal ring-tone should
          be rendered. This is most useful when Alert-Info header field
          parameters are being used. For example, in <xref target="I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances"></xref>, an Alert-Info
          header field needs to be present containing the "appearance"
          parameter, but no special ringtone need be specified. If no special
          alerting is to be used, urn:alert:tone:normal should be used.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="external">
					<t>This tone is used to indicate that the caller is external to the
          enterprise or PBX system. This could be a call from the PSTN or from
          a SIP trunk. For this case, urn:alert:tone:external should be
          used.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="internal">
					<t>This tone is used to indicate that the caller is internal to the
          enterprise or PBX system. The call could have been originated from
          another user on this PBX or on another PBX within the enterprise.
          For this case, the urn:alert:tone:internal should be used.</t>
					<t></t>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section anchor="Public_Tones" title="Public telephone network tones">
				<t>This section defines some commonly encountered tones in the public
        telephone service, according to the <xref target="E.180"></xref> and
        <xref target="E.182"></xref>. They are as follows.</t>
				<section title="ringing ">
					<t>This tone indicates that the default or normal ring-tone should
          be rendered. For this case, urn:alert:tone:ringing should be
          used.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="busy ">
					<t>This tone indicates that a tone should be rendered that indicates
          to the caller that the callee is busy. For this case,
          urn:alert:tone:busy should be used.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="intrusion ">
					<t>This tone indicates that a tone should be rendered that indicates
          to the participants in a call that the privacy of the conversation
          has been breached. For this case, urn:alert:tone:intrusion should be
          used.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="record ">
					<t>This tone indicates that a tone should be rendered which advises
          the caller when to begin a message which will be recorded. For this
          case, urn:alert:tone:record should be used.</t>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section title="Service Tones">
				<t>These tones are used to indicate specific PBX and telephony
        services.</t>
				<section title="call-waiting">
					<t>The call waiting Service <xref target="TS24.615"></xref> permits
          a callee to be notified of an incoming call whilst the media
          resources are not available for the incoming call and the callee is
          engaged in an active or held call. Subsequently, the callee can
          either accept, reject, or ignore the incoming call. There is an
          interest on the caller side to be informed about the call waiting
          situation on the callee side. Having this information the caller can
          decide whether to continue waiting for callee to pickup or better to
          call some time later when it is estimated that the callee could have
          finished the ongoing conversation. To provide this information, the
          callee's UAS or proxy aware of the call waiting condition can add
          the call-waiting indication URN to the Alert-Info header. As
          call-waiting information may be subject to the callee's privacy
          concerns, the exposure of this information SHALL be done only if
          explicitly required by the user. The urn:alert:service:call-waiting
          should be used for this case.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="forward">
					<t>This feature is used in a 180 response when a call forwarding
          feature has been initiated on an INVITE. Many PBX system implement a
          forwarding "beep" followed by normal ringing to indicate this. The
          urn:alert:service:forward should be used for this case. Note that a
          181 response can be used in place of this URN.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="transfer-recall">
					<t>This feature is used when a blind transfer <xref target="RFC5589"></xref> has been performed by a server on behalf of
          the transferor and fails. Instead of failing the call, the server
          calls back the transferor, giving them another chance to transfer or
          otherwise deal with the call. This service tone is used to
          distinguish this INVITE from any other normal incoming call. The
          urn:alert:service:transfer-recall should be used for this case.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="auto-callback">
					<t>This feature is used when a user has utilized a server to
          implement an automatic callback service. When the user is available,
          the server calls back the user and utilizes this service tone to
          distinguish this from any other normal incoming call. The
          urn:alert:service:auto-callback should be used for this case.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="hold-recall">
					<t>This feature is used when a server implements a call hold timer
          on behalf of an endpoint. After a certain period of time of being on
          hold, the user who placed the call on hold is alerted to either
          retrieve the call or otherwise dispose of the call. This service
          tone is used to distinguish this case from any other normal incoming
          call. The urn:alert:service:hold-recall should be used for this
          case.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="crisis">
					<t>This feature is used for emergency announcements sent over PBX
          systems such as building evacuations, alarms, etc. This service tone
          is used to distinguish this case from any other normal incoming
          call. The urn:alert:service:crisis should be used for this case.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="priority">
					<t>This sub-level is used to indicate that a priority level alert
          should be applied for the type of alerting specified. For example,
          urn:alert:tone:priority would be used to generate priority
          alerting.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="short">
					<t>This sub-level is used to indicate that the alert type specified
          should be rendered shorter than normal. In contact centers, this is
          sometimes referred to as "abbreviated ringing" or a "zip tone". For
          example, urn:alert:tone:short would generate a shorter than normal
          ring-tone.</t>
				</section>
				<section title="delayed">
					<t>This sub-level is used to indicate that the alerting type
          specified show be rendered after a short delay. In some bridged
          line/shared line appearance implementations, this is used so that
          the bridged line does not ring at exactly the same time as the main
          line, but is delayed a few seconds. For example,
          urn:alert:tone:delayed would generate an external ring-tone, delayed
          by a few seconds.</t>

			<section title="National Variant Indications for public telephone network tones">
				<t>In the PSTN, different tones are used in different countries. End
        users are accustomed to hear the callee's country ringing or busy
        tone.</t>
				<t>The ISO 3166-1 country code <xref target="ISO 3166-1"></xref> is
        used as a top-level to indicate which country specific tone should be
        rendered. For example, to indicate tones from South Africa, the
        following URN would be used: &lt;urn:alert:tone:za&gt;</t>
				<t>The particular rendering for many country specific ringing and busy
        tones is described in <xref target="TR 101041"></xref> :</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Combinations of URNs">
				<t>In some cases, more than one URN will need to be specified to fully
        define a particular tone. This is done by including multiple URNs. For
        example, an internal, priority call could be indicated by Alert-Info:
        &lt;urn:alert:tone:internal&gt;, &lt;urn:alert:tone:priority&gt;. A
        priority call waiting tone could be indicated by Alert-Info:
        &lt;urn:alert:service:call-waiting&gt;,
        &lt;urn:alert:tone:priority&gt;. And finally, a short Albanian
        auto-callback tone could be indicated Alert-Info:
        &lt;urn:alert:service:auto-callback&gt;, &lt;urn:alert:tone:short&gt;,
        &lt;urn:alert:tone:al&gt;.</t>

		<section title="User Agent Behavior">
			<t>Upon receiving a SIP request or a SIP 180 Ringing response with an
      Alert-Info header that contains a single or multiple 'alert' URNs, the
      User Agent (UA) attempts to match the received URNs with the known
      indications. If no match is found, the User Agent (UA) ignores the
      received 'alert' URNs and proceeds with the normal operation. If the one
      or multiple URNs matches a known indication, the User Agent (UA) renders
      the indication(s) to the user according to the tone or service
      identifier in the received alert URN. The User Agent (UA) is responsible
      for the non disturbing rendering if multiple indications and network
      resources are to be rendered simultaneously.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Proxy Behavior">
			<t></t>
			<t>A SIP proxy MAY add a URN or multiple URNs to the Alert-Info header
      in a SIP request or a 180 Ringing provisional response when it needs to
      provide additional information about the call or about the provided
      service. A SIP Proxy SHOULD NOT add a mixture of the 'alert' URNs and
      URIs to the Alert-Info header that may cause disturbing rendering
      interference at the recepient's User Agent (UA).</t>
			<t>Following example shows both the network audio resource referenced by
      the HTTP URI and the URN indication for the call-waiting service
      transported by the Alert-Info header in a 180 Ringing provisional
      response.</t>

			<t>This section registers a new URN scheme with the registration
      template provided in section Registration Template.</t>
			<t>Below, the section 7.1 details how to register new alert-identifiers.
      Descriptions of alert-indications for the first two alert-identifiers
      described in this document , service and tone, are given in Section 7.2
      and Section 7.3, respectively. Finally, Section 7.4 contains the initial
      registration table.</t>
			<section title="New alert-identifiers">
				<t>Alert URNs are identified by labels managed by IANA, according to
        the processes outlined in <xref target="RFC2434"></xref> in a new
        registry called "Alert URN Labels". Thus, creating a new
        alert-identifier requires IANA action. The policy for adding a new
        alert-identifier category is 'Standards Action'. (This document
        defines the alert-identifier categories 'service' and 'tone'.) The
        policy for assigning labels to alert top-level indications or
        sub-indications and the rules to combine top-level indications and
        sub-indications may differ for each alert-identifier category and MUST
        be defined by the document describing the coresponding alert
        indications. The entries in the registration table have the following
        format:</t>

			<section title="Alert-category">
				<t>This section defines the alert-identifier registration within the
        IANA registry defined in Section 7.1, using the alert-category labels
        'service' and 'tone'.</t>
				<t>The 'tone' alert-category label provides information about ringing
        tones generated by a UAS and rendered to the callee in response to an
        INVITE.</t>
				<t>The 'service' alert-category label describes tones that should be
        generated by the UAC or UAS and rendered to the caller or calee upon
        receipt of a 180 response or a request. The normal rendering is audio,
        however there can be other renderings applicable if needed by the user
        interface specifics.</t>

		</section>
		<section title="Internationalization Considerations ">
			<t>The alert-identifier labels are protocol elements <xref target="RFC3536"></xref> and are not normally seen by users. Thus, the
      character set for these elements is restricted, as described in Section
      6.</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
			<t>As an identifier, the alert URN does not appear to raise any
      particular security issues. The indications described by the 'alert' URN
      are meant to be well-known, so privacy considerations do not apply to
      the URN.</t>
			<t>Provision of the specific indications from callee to caller may raise
      privacy issues. Such provision SHALL always be explicitly authorised by
      the callee.</t>
