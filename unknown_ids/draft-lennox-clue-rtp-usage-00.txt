Internet-Draft         RTP Usage for Telepresence           October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Telepresence systems, of the architecture described by
   [I-D.ietf-clue-telepresence-use-cases] and
   [I-D.ietf-clue-telepresence-requirements], will send and receive
   multiple media streams, where the number of streams in use is
   potentially large and asymmetric between endpoints, and streams can
   come and go dynamically.  These characteristics lead to a number of
   architectural design choices which, while still in the scope of
   potential architectures envisioned by the Real-Time Transport
   Protocol [RFC3550], must be fairly different than those typically
   implemented by the current generation of voice or video conferencing
   systems.  This document makes recommendations about how streams
   should be encoded and transmitted in RTP for this telepresence
   architecture.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.


3.  Source multiplexing

   Telepresence sessions have lots of media streams: easily dozens at a
   time (given, e.g., a continuous presence screen in a multi-point
   conference), potentially out of a possible pool of hundreds.
   Furthermore, endpoints will have an asymmetric number of media
   streams.

   In such an environment the usual model of existing SIP endpoints --
   sending zero or one source (in each direction) per RTP session --
   doesn't scale, and mapping asymmetric numbers of sources to sessions
   is needlessly complex.

   Therefore, telepresence systems SHOULD use a single RTP session per
   media type, except where there's a need to give sessions different
   transport treatment.  All sources of the same media type are sent
   over this single RTP session.  This architecture (known as "source
   multiplexing") was defined by [RFC3550], but was used rarely until
   more recently by some Telepresence systems.

   Multiplexing multiple media streams in this way has additional
   advantages.  It makes going through middle boxes considerably easier,
   as it allows Telepresence devices to work through SIP B2BUAs that do

   not support multiple media lines of the same media type.  It also
   simplifies NAT and firewall traversal by allowing endpoint to deal
   with only a single address/port mapping per media type rather than
   multiple mappings.

   During call setup, a single RTP session is negotiated for each media
   type.  In SDP, only one media line is negotiated per media and
   multiple media streams are sent over the same UDP channel negotiated
   using the SDP media line.


4.  Demultiplexing sources

   The main issue to work out is how receivers demultiplex and interpret
   the multiple media streams.  There are several alternatives that need
   to be analyzed in light of their advantages and disadvantages for
   different scenarios.  In the CLUE Framework
   [I-D.ietf-clue-framework], different types of audio and video
   captures are distinguished.  There are main and presentation video
   captures, and "switched" and "composite/mixed" synthetic captures
   [edt. names may chance in the Framework].

   In RTP [RFC3550], a synchroniztion source (SSRC) value corresponds to
   a single stream of media, which is fed into a single decoding
   process.  It therefore seems fairly clear that statically-transmitted
   captures, and probably composited/mixed captures, should be
   distinguished by SSRC values.  There may, however, be additional
   meta-data needed as well, for instance to communicate layout
   decisions or recommendations about the sources

   For switched sources, however, things are less clear.  Switched
   sources could be sent with an SSRC corresponding to the switched
   source, with some meta-data indicating the original source that is
   being sent at any given time.  Alternately, they could be sent with
   an SSRC indicating the original source that is being transmitted,
   with meta-data indicating that the source is being sent because it
   corresponds to a receiver's requested switched source.

   In each case, this meta-data could either be sent in-band in the RTP
   session, or out-of-band using some sort of lightweight signaling
   protocol.

   If the meta-data is sent in the RTP session, it could either be sent
   as the RTP CSRC, or as a new RTP header tension [RFC5285].  In the
   semantics of RTP, the CSRC would seem to make sense for describing
   composited sources, and for switched sources if the SSRC corresponds
   to the switch rather than the original sources.  RTP header
   extensions would probably make more sense for other cases.

   All these potential approaches need further study to identify their
   benefits and drawbacks.


5.  Transmission of presentation sources

   Most existing videoconferencing systems use separate RTP sessions for
   main and presentation video sources, distinguished by the SDP content
   attribute [RFC4796].  It seems likely that telepresence systems
   should not maintain this transport-level separation, but should
   instead send both main and presentation video over the single video
   RTP session, in just the same manner as with multiple main video
   sources.  However, some receivers need to be able to treat main and
   presentation video differently, so there will need to be a mechanism
   for receivers to reliably distinguish the types of sources.


6.  Other considerations

   As currently defined, H.281 Far-End Camera Control
   [ITU.H281.1994][RFC4573] does not, in SIP-based videoconferences,
   support selecting among multiple remote sources (though it does in
   H.323 conferences controled by an MCU, which can assign terminal IDs
   to sources).  When RTP sessions contain multiple sources, this
   limitation becomes pressing.  (However, this problem does not appear
   to be in scope of the CLUE working group.)


7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for multiplexed RTP do not seem to be
   different than for non-multiplexed RTP.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: please remove this section before publication as
