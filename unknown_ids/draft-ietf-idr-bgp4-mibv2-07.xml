  XML2RFC offers an include feature described in the XML2RFC README
  file.  That syntax, however, contradicts the DTD requirements to
  have <reference> elements within the <references> element, so an 
  XML parser is likely to find your XML file invalid.  It may be
  possible that XML2RFC will change their DTD so that the XML file
  remains valid when their style of include is used.

  In the meantime therefore, we use an alternative valid-XML approach
  to includes, which unfortunately require that define your includes
  at the beginning of the file. Since the biggest benefit of includes
  is for references, this requires that your references be defined in
  ENTITY clauses here before being "included" and cited elsewhere in
  the file.

    <!-- ********************************************* -->

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>As part of the IETF standardization effort for the BGP-4 protocol,
      <xref target="RFC4273"></xref> was written to address open issues in
      the previous version of the BGP-4 MIB, <xref target="RFC1657"></xref>.
      However, that RFC was primarily intended to address the base BGP-4
      protocol as documented in <xref target="RFC4271"></xref>.
      </t>

      <t>The BGP-4 protocol has greatly increased in scope over the years
      from its original definition.  Scaling mechanisms such as 
      <xref target="RFC4456">Route Reflection</xref> and
      <xref target="RFC5065">Confederations</xref> have been introduced.  
      <xref target="RFC4760">Multi-protocol extensions</xref> were
      introduced which allowed advertisement of reachability such as 
      <xref target="RFC2545">IPv6</xref>, <xref target="RFC3107">MPLS
      Labeled routes</xref>, etc.
      </t>

      <t>This MIB addresses several of the deficiencies of the previous
      BGP-4 MIB and provides an extension mechanism to permit additional MIB
      modules to be authored without requiring the base BGP-4 MIB to be
      updated.  This is seen as a desirable goal since the BGP-4 protocol
      continues to receive attention by those wishing to add to its
      functionality.</t>

      <t>In particular, this MIB addresses some specific
      weaknesses of the previous version:</t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
	  <t>Add the ability to monitor IPv6 BGP-4 peering sessions and
	  carry IPv6 reachability.  Other forms of reachability can be added at
	  a later date courtesy of the address-family independent manner in
	  which this was done.</t>

	  <t>Add several counters of operational interest.  For example,
	  the number of routes received from a given BGP peer.</t>

	  <t>Replaces objects that were incapable of carrying the full range of
	  their values with ones that can.</t>

	  <t>Provides human-readable output for some complex data
	  structures, such as the AS_PATH while also preserving a version of
	  the data that is canonically machine readable.</t>
	</list>
      </t>

    </section>

    <!-- Design Principles  -->

    <!--
        <t>This section is here to remind authors of the Design Principles
         for MIB modules.</t>

        <t>To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering
        practice, an explicit attempt should be made to keep this MIB module
        as simple as possible.  This can be accomplished by applying the
        following criteria to objects proposed for inclusion:</t>
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Start with a small set of essential objects and add only
            as objects are needed.
          </t>
          <t>
            Require objects be essential for either fault or
            performance or configuration management.
          </t>
          <t>
            Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.
          </t>
          <t>
            Limit the total number of objects.
          </t>
          <t>
            Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in
            this or other MIB modules. The complexity of deriving values
            should be done by the managament station, not the agent.
          </t>
          <t>
            Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily
            instrumented.  The guideline that has been followed in previous
            MIB modules is one counter per critical section per layer.
          </t>
          <t>
            Consider the requirements of a small footprint system, such 
            as a set-top box as well as the expanded functionality beneficial 
            to a large foootprint system. To the degree possible, costs 
            associated with advanced functionality should be borne only 
            by the systems implementing such functionality, and the overhead 
            of advanced functionality should minimally impact systems which 
            do not implement the advanced functionality.</t>

            REVISION "200601110000Z"
            DESCRIPTION
                   "Changes from RFC 1657:

                    1) Fixed the definitions of the notifications
                       to make them equivalent to their initial
                       definition in RFC 1269.
                    2) Added compliance and conformance info.
                    3) Updated information for the values of
                       bgpPeerNegotiatedVersion, bgp4PathAttrLocalPref,
                       bgp4PathAttrCalcLocalPref,

                       bgp4PathAttrASPathSegement.
                    4) Added additional clarification comments where
                       needed.
                    5) Noted where objects do not fully reflect
                       the protocol as Known Issues.
                    6) Updated the DESCRIPTION for the
                       bgp4PathAttrAtomicAggregate object.
                    7) The following objects have had their DESCRIPTION
                       clause modified to remove the text that suggested
                       (using 'should' verb) initializing the counter
                       to zero on a transition to the established state:
                         bgpPeerInUpdates, bgpPeerOutUpdates,
                         bgpPeerInTotalMessages, bgpPeerOutTotalMessages
                       Those implementations that still do this are
                       still compliant with this new wording.
                       Applications should not assume counters have

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <!--[TODO] Remember to consider security from the start. -->

      <t>This MIB relates to a system providing inter-domain routing.  As
      such, improper manipulation of the objects represented by this MIB may
      result in denial of service to a large number of end-users.</t>
 
      <t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
      with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such objects
      may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
      The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
      proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
      These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t>
      <list type="symbols">
	<t> bgpPeerAdminStatus - Improper change of bgpPeerAdminStatus, from
	start to stop, can cause significant disruption of the connectivity
	to those portions of the Internet reached via the applicable remote
	BGP peer.</t>

        <t>bgpPeerConnectRetryInterval - Improper change of this object can
        cause connections to be disrupted for extremely long time periods
        when otherwise they would be restored in a relatively short period of
        time.</t>

        <t>bgpPeerHoldTimeConfigured, bgpPeerKeepAliveConfigured -
        Misconfiguration of these objects can make BGP sessions more fragile
        and less resilient to denial of service attacks on the inter-domain
        routing system.</t>
 
        <t>bgpPeerMinASOriginationInterval,
        bgpPeerMinRouteAdvertisementInterval - Misconfiguration of these
        objects may adversely affect global Internet convergence of the
        routes advertised by this BGP speaker.  This may result in long-lived
        routing loops and blackholes for the portions of the Internet that
        utilize these routes.</t>
     </list>
     </t>

      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
      MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
      even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
      encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
      via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability: 
        <list style="symbols">
	  <t>bgpPeerAfLocalAddrType, bgpPeerAfLocalAddr,bgpPeerAfLocalPort
	  bgpPeerAfRemoteAddrType, bgpPeerAfRemoteAddr, bgpPeerAfRemotePort,
	  bgpPeerLocalAddr, bgpPeerLocalPort, bgpPeerRemoteAddr,
	  bgpPeerRemotePort - A BGP peer's local and remote addresses might
	  be sensitive for ISPs who want to keep interface addresses on
	  routers confidential in order to prevent router addresses used for
	  a denial of service attack or spoofing.  Note that other tables
	  which share elements of these objects as indexes may similarly
	  expose sensitive information.</t>

	  <t>bgpNlriTable, bgpAdjRibsOutTable, bgpAfPathAttrTable,
	  bgpAsPathTable, bgpRcvdPathAttrTable, bgp4PathAttrTable - A BGP
	  peer's routing information may be sensitive for ISPs as the
	  contents of their routing tables may expose details related to
	  business relationships as implemented in Internet routing.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
      if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
      and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
      module.</t>

      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
      provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>,
      section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
      mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
      RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
      cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to
      ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
      module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
      those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
      SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document includes an OID, bgpExtensions, which
      defines a name space for future BGP extensions.  IANA is requested to
      create a new registry for new OIDs under bgpExtensions that will
      define the root OID of future MIB modules for bgp extensions.  The
      assignment OIDs should be done based upon IDR working group
      consensus.</t>

    <!-- References Section -->

    <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
   references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
   normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
   The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

   The standard MIB boilerplate available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html includes lists of
   normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
   specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
   modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
   then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
   in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
   IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
   SHALL point to the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
   policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
   text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
   documents containing imported definitions (other those already
   mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
   Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD point to the most recent
version of the specification in question.
