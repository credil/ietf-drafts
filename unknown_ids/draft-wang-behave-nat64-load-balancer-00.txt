    load-balancer, e.g., how to assign different prefix64s to different 
    hosts. In this memo, we propose our investigation on this topic.

 1. Introduction  

    NAT64 gateway [NAT64] is an equipment for data translation between IP 
    v4 and v6 families. With the development of the network, the data 
    transmission volume is being increased rapidly. In order to make the 
    NAT64 more scalable, load-balancing is one of the most important 
    requirements for NAT64 boxes. [STANDBY] has discussed the load 
    balancing mechanism for NAT64, however, the load-balancer mechanism 
    has never been mentioned yet. This memo analyses and summarizes the 
    different prefix selecting policies and load-balancer approaches,

 Internet-Draft       Some Considerations on the         December 2009 
                       Load-Balancer for NAT64                           
     

    which are used together with the corresponding address synthesis 
    approaches defined in [DNS64] and [Learn_Prefix]. 

 2. Terminology 

    This memo makes use of the terms defined in [NAT64] and [DNS64]. 
    Below are provided terms specific to this document: 

    Prefix64: an IPv6 prefix used for synthesizing IPv6 addresses for 
    the IPv4 hosts. See [Format] for more details. 

 3. Prefix Selecting Policy  

    During a session a load-balancer enables an IPv6 client to choose a 
    certain NAT64 box by assigning a certain prefix64 for an IPv4 server. 
    E.g., there are two NAT64 boxes (NAT64-A and NAT64-B) providing the 
    data translation service between an IPv6 network and the IPv4 
    Internet, and prefix64-A and prefix64-B corresponding to NAT64-A and 
    NAT64-B separately. An IPv6 client in the IPv6 network wants to 
    initiate a communication with an IPv4 server in the IPv4 Internet. 
    If the load-balancer allocates prefix64-A for the IPv4 server, thus 
    the IPv6 client will choose NAT64-A to communicate with the IPv4 
    server, and if prefix64-B, will choose NAT64-B. 

    In order to achieve load balancing for a set of NAT64 boxes, a load-
    balancer can allocate prefix64s for the IPv4 server based on some 
    prefix selecting policies, thus the loads can be evenly distributed 
    on the set of NAT64 boxes. This section provides some prefix 
    selecting policies, three static and one dynamic. These policies are 
    not specific to any load-balancer. 

3.1. Source-Based Prefix Selecting Policy  

    A source-based prefix selecting policy allows a load-balancer to 
    choose prefix64s according to the IP address of the requesting 
    client. In the above example, the load-balancer can choose prefix64-A 
    if the IPv6 address of the requesting client is odd, and prefix64-B 
    if even. 

    The advantages and disadvantages of this policy are left for the 
    future exploration.

 Internet-Draft       Some Considerations on the         December 2009 
                       Load-Balancer for NAT64                           
     

3.2. Destination-Based Prefix Selecting Policy 

    A destination-based prefix selecting policy is that a load-balancer 
    chooses prefix64s according to the IP address of the IPv4 server. In 
    the above example, load-balancer can choose prefix64-A if the IPv4 
    address of the IPv4 server queried by the requesting client is odd, 
    and prefix64-B if even. 

    The advantages and disadvantages of this policy are left for the 
    future exploration. 

3.3. Round-Robin Prefix Selecting Policy  

    A round-robin prefix selecting policy allows a load-balancer to 
    choose prefix64s according to the arriving sequence of the 
    requesting client. In the above example, load-balancer can choose 
    prefix64-A to the first arriving requesting client, prefix64-B to 
    the second, prefix64-A to the third, prefix64-B to the fourth, and 
    so on. 

    The advantages and disadvantages of this policy are for the future 
    study. 

3.4. Dynamic Prefix Selecting Policy  

    The above three policies are all static prefix selecting policies, 
    though they could pre-evaluate the capabilities of NAT64 boxes based 
    on some criterions and allocate the prefix64s according to the 
    capabilities of their NAT64 boxes, whereas once the evaluation is 
    finished, these policies are fixed and can't reflect NAT64s' timely 
    load changes. If we intend to enable load-balancer to change the 
    prefix64s according to NAT64s' real-time load changes, a dynamic 
    prefix selection policy is necessary. A dynamic policy requires a 
    load-balancer to timely collect state information of the NAT64 boxes 
    and allocate prefix64s according to their NAT64 boxes' loads, which 
    will bring huge network burden. 

 4. Load-balancer Selection 

    A load-balancer can be a DNS64, a DNS server, a DHCP server, an edge 
    router, or the IPv6 host self. There are some special considerations 
    with the different load-balancers.

 Internet-Draft       Some Considerations on the         December 2009 
                       Load-Balancer for NAT64                           
     

4.1. DNS64 as Load-balancer 

    DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA resource records (RRs) 
    from A RRs. Together with NAT64 translator, these two mechanisms 
    enable an IPv6-only client to initiate communications to an IPv4-
    only server using the FQDN of the server. DNS64 synthesizes an AAAA 
    RR from an A RR containing a real IPv4 address of the responder and 
    a prefix64. 

    In the scenario of an IPv6 client in the IPv6 network wants to 
    initiate a communication with an IPv4 server in the IPv4 Internet, 
    for load balancing DNS64 decides which prefix64 to be used in the 
    synthesized response based on one of the prefix selecting policies 
    defined in the section 3. With the synthesized IPv6 address the IPv6 
    client will choose the NAT64 corresponding to the prefix64 of the 
    IPv6 address is synthesized with to communicate with the IPv4 server. 

4.2. Prefix64 Assigner as Load-balancer 

    [Learn_Prefix] has provided some mechanisms for the hosts in the 
    IPv6 network to obtain the prefix64 of their NAT64, with the 
    prefix64 the hosts could synthesize an appropriate IPv6 address that 
    will be routed to the translator for the translator to process. In 
    the context of load balancing for NAT64 boxes, these mechanisms have 
    some special consideration.  

 4.2.1. DNS Server as Load-balancer 

    [Learn_Prefix] has defined a NAPTR RR to represent NAT64's prefix64. 
    To achieve load balancing for NAT64 boxes, there is a requirement to 
    add multiple NAPTR RRs to zone file corresponding to each prefix64. 
    Upon receiving a NAPTR query, DNS server responses to the requestor 
    one of these NAPTR RRs based on source-based or round-robin or 
    dynamic prefix selecting policy. Because having no knowledge of the 
    IP address of the queried IPv4 server, destination-based prefix 
    selecting policy is not suitable in this case. 

 4.2.2. DHCP Server as Load-balancer 

    Another mechanism for a host to learn the prefix64 of its NAT64 
    described in [Learn_Prefix] is to make DHCP server to allocate 
    prefix64 to the hosts. The prefix selecting policy can be source-
    based or round-robin or dynamic. Because having no knowledge of the 
    IP address of the IPv4 server which its client wants to communicate

 Internet-Draft       Some Considerations on the         December 2009 
                       Load-Balancer for NAT64                           
     

    with, DHCP server can't use destination-based prefix selection 
    policy.  

 4.2.3. Default Gateway as Load-balancer 

    [Learn_Prefix] also uses Router Advertisement (RA) messages to 
    transfer the prefix64 to the IPv6 hosts. If the edge router is 
    attached to only one multicast link, no prefix selection policy 
    defined in the section 3 can be used. If the edge router is attached 
    to multiple multicast links, the prefix selecting policy can be 
    source-based or round-robin or dynamic. Due to have no knowledge of 
    the IP address of the IPv4 server which its host wants to 
    communicate with, edge router can't use destination-based prefix 
    selecting policy.  

 4.2.4. IPv6 Client as Load-balancer 

    Multiple prefix64s are learnt through the approaches defined in 
    [learn-prefix], it's up to the IPv6 client to determine which prefix 
    is used. The prefix selecting policy can be destination-based, 
    source-based (only one prefix64 is used) or round-robin or dynamic.
