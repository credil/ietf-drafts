	The standard operation of the General Internet Signaling
        Transport (GIST) Protocol uses a path-coupled message routing
        method (PC-MRM) to find nodes interested in signaling message
        exchanges. This specification proposes an Explicit Signaling
        Target Message Routing Method (EST-MRM) to allow for
        transmission of signaling messages to explicit targets.
	While the PC-MRM implicitly addresses signaling nodes by
        an interception method, the EST-MRM allows to explicitly

<section title="Introduction" anchor='sec:intro'>
<!-- ================================================================== -->

<t>
The standard operation of the General Internet Signaling Transport
(GIST) Protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp"/> uses a
path-coupled message routing method (PC-MRM) to find nodes interested
in signaling message exchanges. The assumption is that signaling
involves the manipulation of state held in network elements along the
flow's data path. The path-coupled signaling paradigm tries to ensure
the alignment of control functions to the actual data path by letting
intermediate on-path nodes intercept the corresponding signaling messages.
</t>

<t>
For mobility environments seamless handovers are a desirable
objective. If signaling takes place after a handover was performed, it
will take some time until the state update has been completed. Thus,
there exist proposals to start the signaling before the handover takes
place and to use the current point of attachment for completion of the
signaling process. This "anticipated handover" enables a
pre-reservation of resources in a quality-of-service context for
instance, i.e., for QoS NSLP signaling applications <xref
target="I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp" />. Therefore, a resource 
reservation can be used immediately after the handover
was performed.
</t>

<t>
With the path-coupled MRM, however, such kind of optimization
is impossible, since state should be established or manipulated
along a data path that is not used yet, but probably will be 
in the future. Therefore, in order to support anticipated handovers
a signaling message routing is required that is not strictly on path.
</t>

<t>
In <xref target="fig:anticipated-handover"/> an example for an
anticipated handover scenario is shown. If the mobile node (MN) is a
data sender for flow f_o and has information that it may change its
point of attachment from access A to access B, it starts signaling for
resources along the new path that begins at B. First, the MN sends
signaling messages to A and A will signal to B. B can then use
path-coupled signaling in order to find the correct data path for the
potential new flow f_n towards the CN.  Since signaling messages are
sent to A, but concerning f_n, a PC-MRM cannot be used. Similarly, the
signaling between A and B is not path related and must be done
explicitly.

</t>

<t>
It is out of scope of this specification how the addressing
information about the future flow f_n is obtained by the MN or how A
determines the address of the candidate router B that must be signaled
next. One possibility is to use the CARD protocol <xref
target='RFC4066'/> or that some additional addressing information
(such as MAC addresses of access points) is carried in the NSLP. Thus,
it is also allowed to let the source address of f_n being unspecified
if the MN has no knowledge about its actual future address. Since it
can be assumed that B has enough information to determine the required
address, it is then up to B to fill in the missing information for the
flow before continuing with the path-coupled signaling in (c).

<t>
Moreover, the path-coupled MRM uses the router alert option for
interception of signaling messages in intermediate nodes.  This raised
some concerns on the wide applicability of NSIS signaling, since packets with 
router alert options are normally processed by the control processor 
(i.e., in the slow path) of the router. The herein defined Explicit Signaling
Target Message Routing Method (EST-MRM) does not use a
router alert option in Query packets and may be used
for direct signaling to dedicated signaling proxies
or for relaying signaling messages after the signaling
messages have been properly authorized by such dedicated
systems. 
</t>


<!--
End-system based signaling is, however, desired in many cases
in order to provide real end-to-end QoS etc. So for an incremental
deployment of NSIS it may be helpful to provide a dedicated system (proxy) to
which the end-systems can explicitly signal their requests.  This dedicated
system then performs all necessary actions to assure that the request
is properly authorized etc.  After the request has been validated, the
dedicated system may continue to forward the request in a path-coupled 
manner, i.e., with a router-alert option. This time the router accepts the 
request, because the dedicated system is a trusted internal entity.

Another motivation for the EST-MRM is its use together with
controlling virtualized nodes or virtual links between them.
<xref target="fig:vnodes"/> shows a substrate node hosting
two virtual nodes A and B and a control entity that manages
the virtual nodes and virtual resources, e.g., virtual links.
If the virtual nodes possess own IP addresses as indicated by
IP addresses A and B traffic along a virtual link (e.g., L2 tunnel)
may be directly destined to A. Using path-coupled signaling
for the tunnel flow to A would work for intermediate systems
on the path, but not for the substrate node as end system.
NSIS signaling messages to the control entity must be explicitly addressed to the 
IP address X of the substrate node instead of the IP address A.
Otherwise one must rely on either a running NSIS entity inside
a virtual node or intercept packets inside the substrate node before
delivering them to the virtual node. While the first method puts
unnecessary constraints on the software running inside a virtual 
node, the second method would affect the data transparency adversely.

The Hypath proposal <xref target="I-D.cordeiro-nsis-hypath" />
defined a similar MRM for QoS signaling between off-path resource control
elements like bandwidth brokers. It is for further study, how the EST-MRM
can be unified with the Hypath proposal.

<!-- ================================================================== -->
<section title="Explicit Signaling Target MRM">
<!-- ================================================================== -->
<t>
In order to support cases like the ones described in the introduction,
this document proposes the specification of an Explicit Signaling
Target MRM (EST-MRM).
</t>

<t>
The EST-MRM uses a normal encapsulation for Query messages, i.e., UDP
encapsulation with the destination default port for GIST and the
destination IP address set to the next signaling hop. The source IP
address SHOULD be set to the signaling source address of the node who
is sending the message. EST-MRM routed Query messages do not have to be
intercepted but are explicitly routed to their next (or final)
signaling destination. In contrast to the EST-MRM, the path-coupled
MRM requires Query messages to be sent with Q-mode encapsulation
that is using a router alert option. Furthermore, implementations
must be aware, that Query messages may use with a different encapsulation
method than Q-mode encapsulation, i.e., the check for wrong encapsulation
MUST consider the particular MRM that is being used.
</t>

<t>The EST MRM defines an EST Message Routing Information (EST-MRI)
object that contains information about the actual data flow that is
being signaled as well as addressing information for the signaling
message routing and transport itself.
</t>

<t>
A node receiving a GIST message with an EST-MRI must check whether it
has one local address that matches the destination signaling
address. If it is not the case, it should forward the GIST message
basically unchanged towards the signaling destination address, only
with a decremented GIST Hop Count. Thus, even if the message gets
intercepted by accident, it will be forwarded to the final signaling
destination.
</t>

<t>
It is up to the signaling application's logic to determine the next
signaling hop. Usually, it will be related somehow to the given data
flow, e.g., the signaling target will be along a flows data path. In
the particular example of the anticipated handover, signaling targets
are the current access router as well as the candidate access router
that is presumably the next ingress node for the data flow.
</t>

<t>
When transmitting a signaling message with the EST-MRI, the outer IP
destination address SHOULD be set to the destination signaling address
of the EST-MRI.  In principle it is also possible to forward the
signaling message to a node that is not the final destination
signaling node.  In this case, the destination signaling address and
the IP destination address are not the same. This allows to let the
signaling take multiple intermediate hops. This mechanisms is,
however, for further study and its use is currently not recommended.
</t>

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->
<section title="Explicit Signaling Target MRI" anchor="MRI-def">
<!-- --------------------------------------- -->
<t>
The EST-MRI object (<xref target='fig:est-mri-layout'/>) starts with
the common MRI header (cf. section A.3.1 of
<xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp"/>) and carries a data flow address
description that is identical to the one that is defined in the
Path-coupled MRI (PC-MRI). In addition to that it carries at least
information about the origin signaling address and the destination
signaling address, which are usually identical to the IP source and IP
destination address of the UDP encapsulated signaling
message. Furthermore, it may contain an additional IP address of a
network node where the data flow, which is described by the PC-MRI,
enters the network. It is necessary to provide this information in
some cases since the currently deployed routing protocols can only
determine the next hop in direction towards the destination, but not
backwards towards the source. Thus, this information must be provided
to the next hop in most cases.
</t>

<t>The EST-MRI object has the following layout:
<figure anchor='fig:est-mri-layout'>
 <artwork><![CDATA[
EST-MRI= MRI-header
         PC-MRI
         EST-Control

         Destination-Signaling-Address
         [ Ingress-Node-Address ]
]]></artwork>
<postamble>Layout of the Explicit Signaling Target Message Routing Information</postamble>
</figure>
</t>

<t>The binary representation is shown in <xref
target='fig:EST-MRI-bitlevel'/>.  First, it contains the normal data
flow address descriptor that is required for path-coupled
signaling. The latter is necessary so that a Resource Management Function (RMF) 
can determine the path of the data flow that is being signaled for. If the initiator
cannot predict its future address, it is allowed to set the source IP
address in the PC-MRI to unspecified (either 0.0.0.0 or ::).  After
the PC-MRI, an EST-Control field is provided, that provides further
information on the following fields or their interpretation
respectively. In addition to this description three IP addresses may
be provided. The Origin Signaling Address is the address of the node
who initiated the signaling. The Destination Signaling Address is the
address of the signaling peer that should receive the signaling
message. Both Origin Signaling Address and Destination Signaling
Address are mandatory to specify. They may be both either IPv4 or
IPv6. The actual type is given by the version field (IPVerS) in the high order
EST-Control word. Currently, unicast, anycast, or multicast addresses
are allowed for the Destination Signaling Address, whereas only 
unicast addresses are allowed for the Origin Signaling Address.
The same is true for the IP addresses of the outer UDP packet
that contains the Query message.
Providing the signaling addresses explicitly has
several advantages: it can be detected if the outer addresses are 
rewritten by a NAT or if the path-directed signaling is relayed via 
several hops before arriving at the final peer.
</t>

<t>The Ingress Node Address is optional to specify. When not present,
the version field (IPVerI) of the low order word in the EST-Control
field must be set to 0. Otherwise IPVerI indicates the IP
version of the address. It may have a different type than the Origin
Signaling Address or the Destination Signaling Address, but MUST have
the same type as the address pair in the PC-MRI flow address
descriptor. Mismatching versions must be rejected with an "MRI
ValidationFailure" error message with subcode 1 ("IP Version
Mismatch").  The Ingress Node Address is necessary to specify in some
scenarios, because the RMF cannot determine a flow path in the reverse
direction, except for very simple topologies.

<t>
The MRI common header carries the N-flag and SHOULD be set to 0 
for this MRM.
A NAT may have to translate at least one of the Origin Signaling
Address, the Destination Signaling Address, or the Ingress Node
Address. Depending on the signaling scenario it may also have to
translate the contained PC-MRI information (for signaling messages
along (a) and (b) in <xref target="fig:anticipated-handover-sig"/>
this is usually not required).

<t>
The EST-MRI was implemented and tested successfully in the GIST-ka
implementation <xref target='gistka'/>. Thanks to the object oriented
design of the protocol itself and also the implementation, the
implementation effort was quite low. It was shown that even MA re-use
works across PC-MRM and EST-MRM flows, i.e., if some flows are
signaled path-coupled and some are signaled explicitly, further
signaling for both types can re-use existing messaging associations.

<section title="MRM Requirements" anchor="sec:MRMreqs">
<!-- --------------------------- -->
<!-- Changes 00-01:
Intended changes:
please consider section 3.3 requirements from the GIST draft:
   The content of an MRM definition is as follows, using the path-
   coupled MRM as an example:

   o  The format of the information that describes the path that the
      signalling should take, the Message Routing Information (MRI).
      For the path-coupled MRM, this is just the Flow Identifier (see
      Section 5.8.1.1) and some additional control information.
      Specifically, the MRI always includes a flag to distinguish
      between the two directions that signalling messages can take,
      denoted 'upstream' and 'downstream'.

   o  A specification of the IP-level encapsulation of the messages
      which probe the network to discover the adjacent peers.  A
      downstream encapsulation must be defined; an upstream
      encapsulation is optional.  For the path-coupled MRM, this
      information is given in Section 5.8.1.2 and Section 5.8.1.3.
      Current MRMs rely on the interception of probe messages in the
      data plane, but other mechanisms are also possible within the
      overall GIST design and would be appropriate for other types of
      signalling pattern.

   o  A specification of what validation checks GIST should apply to the
      probe messages, for example to protect against IP address spoofing
      attacks.  The checks may be dependent on the direction (upstream
      or downstream) of the message.  For the path-coupled MRM, the
      downstream validity check is basically a form of ingress
      filtering, also discussed in Section 5.8.1.2.

   o  The mechanism(s) available for route change detection, i.e. any
      change in the neighbour relationships that the MRM discovers.  The
      default case for any MRM is soft-state refresh, but additional
      supporting techniques may be possible; see Section 7.1.2.

<t>
Section 3.3. of <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp"/> mentions requirements
on the content of an MRM definition, that are discussed in this section.
</t>

<t>
   "The format of the information that describes the path that the
   signalling should take, the Message Routing Information (MRI).":

This specification describes the MRI format in <xref target="MRI-def"/>.  
Since this signaling message routing method is using an explicit target 
address for the signaling destination (the Destination Signaling Address), 
as well as the Flow Identifier of the data flow, it contains sufficient 
information to determine the signaling path. The adjacent peer may use
the Flow Identifier information to determine the next explicit 
signaling hop.

This MRM is using an explicit target address for the signaling
destination, i.e., the adjacent peer. The IP-level encapsulation 
is based on UDP normal encapsulation, i.e., the address of the
adjacent peer is explicitly written in the outer IP header.
There is no such thing as a downstream encapsulation since
the EST MRM may be used to route the signaling data 'sideways'
if compared to the direction of the data flow (cf. forwarding of
signaling messages along (b) in <xref target="fig:anticipated-handover-sig"/>).

     "A specification of what validation checks GIST should apply to the
      probe messages, for example to protect against IP address spoofing
      attacks.  The checks may be dependent on the direction (upstream
      or downstream) of the message.":

      This specification requires that a node receiving a GIST message 
      with an EST-MRI must check whether it has one local address that 
      matches the destination signaling address. Other
      specific validation checks cannot be provided within this specification
      as they depend on the determination algorithm of the next signaling hop.
      Validation checks should be applied if possible, but they are probably 
      only possible within the NSLP.

   "The mechanism(s) available for route change detection, i.e. any
    change in the neighbour relationships that the MRM discovers.  The
    default case for any MRM is soft-state refresh, but additional
    supporting techniques may be possible;"

    Basically, this MRM also uses soft-state refresh and 
    the NLI as indicator whether the adjacent peer has changed.
    However, since signaling messages routed with the EST MRM are 
    explicitly addressed to nodes and not intercepted
    there should be no re-routing events as GIST level.
    Re-routing events at IP-level will be transparent unless they
    lead to disconnection of the signaling target.

<section title="Security Considerations">
<!-- ================================================================== -->
<t>Basically, the security considerations of GIST apply.
The main change is that Query messages are not sent using Q-mode encapsulation
and that they contain a different MRI object. Since normal encapsulation
is already considered by GIST, no new security considerations are necessary.
Even for initial Query messages with an EST-MRI, the usual mechanisms
like authorized peer database checking and late state installation mechanisms
apply.

<!-- ================================================================== -->
<t>According to section 9 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp"/> this 
specification requires assignment of a new MRI-ID. Until an assignment
happens by IANA, it is suggested to use MRI-ID 125 for the EST-MRM.
