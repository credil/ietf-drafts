      <t>
	Using 6to4 <xref target="RFC3056"/> currently requires manual
	configuration of the relay router or the use of a anycast relay
	router <xref target="RFC3068"/>.  The latter has a number of
	well known issues (add reference).
      </t>
      <t>
	This document attempts to address some of those issues by
	providing a method for clients to discover the address of
	a 6to4 relay router.  It is expected that the 6to4 relay
	router will be managed and that it will be topologically
	close to the client thereby reducing some of the issues
	with using public anycast relay routers.
      </t>
      <t>
	Additionally not all IPv4 address allocated to clients are
	suitable for use with 6to4.  Whether they be <xref
	target="RFC1918"/> address, or other addresses behind a NAT,
	or are behind a firewall which blocks 6to4 encapsulted traffic.
	This document provides a method for the DHCP server operator to
	signal that the address being returned is not suitable for
	use with 6to4.

      <t>
	The 6to4 DHCP Relay Router Option (6to4RRO) has code TBD and
	consists of a single IPv4 address specifing the IPv4 address of
	the 6to4 relay router.  Setting the relay router address to
	0.0.0.0 indicates that 6to4 will not work for returned lease
	address.

	The presence of a 6to4RRO in a reply MUST NOT be used as a
	indication that the client should use 6to4.  It is only a
	instruction to client of how it should do 6to4 if it is
	otherwise configured to use 6to4.

	CPE equipment SHOULD be configured to request the 6to4RRO
	option if 6to4 has been enabled.  If 0.0.0.0 is returned
	in response to the 6to4RRO option the CPE SHOULD disable
	6to4 and withdraw any advertised 6to4 prefixes.

        <t>
	  To prevent accidental 6to4 tunnels a enterprise would set
	  6to4RRO to 0.0.0.0.  This is intended to turn off mobile
	  clients that have accidently left 6to4 enabled when connecting
	  to the enterpises network.

      <section toc="yes" anchor="isp" title="ISP Deployment">
        <t>
	  ISPs, with a IPv6 connection to the public Internet, would
	  set 6to4RRO to point to 6to4 relay routers run by the ISP.
	  This will provide their customers with a managed 6to4 routers
	  which are topologically close to the client.  If the ISP does
	  not have IPv6 connectivity it SHOULD NOT set the 6to4RRO option
	  unless it knows the addresses it it returning will not work
	  with 6to4.
        </t>
        <t>
	  If the ISP is returning a IPv4 addresses which will be subject
	  to network address translation, regardless of whether they have
	  IPv6 connectivity or not, it SHOULD set the returned 6to4RRO
	  option to 0.0.0.0.  This is intended stop clients using IPv4
	  addresses which will not work with 6to4.
