Internet-Draft            Mobility and Privacy              October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Significant steps are being taken right now to make the Internet's
   architecture more scalable and robust in routing, addressing,
   multihoming, mobility, and locator/identifier separation.  However,
   since the Internet is rapidly becoming an essential part of daily
   life for people around the world, our architectural changes need to
   take fundamental social issues into account as a primary
   consideration.  One of those is privacy, and in this case
   particularly privacy of geographic location.  If we do not, we run
   the risk of colliding with established IETF principles (see for
   example [RFC3693]) as well as public policy in many countries around
   the world.

   When the Internet was designed, IP addresses were associated with
   timesharing machines and not with particular users.  In the 1980s it
   began to be likely that a device and thus an IP address would be
   associated with a single user.  Now a single IP address is very
   likely to be associated with a single human being.  Meanwhile, at the
   top of the stack, there has been a convergence of life functions
   using single devices using single addresses.  A person now uses his
   or her personal device and associated IP address for many activities:
   work, shopping, talking, exchanging mail and files, reading,
   listening to music, etc.

   It is this convergence at both the top and bottom of the stack -- to
   a single person per device and to many applications on that device --
   that makes the social issues more and more significant in IETF work.
   People use the Internet for many, more personal, activities than
   before.  The Internet needs to fulfill the obligations expected of a
   communications system essential to modern human society.  Our lower
   layer protocol designs have privacy implications beyond their
   intended scope.


2.  The Risks of Being Traceable

   Issues with revealing geographic location are well-established
   elsewhere.  For example the RAND review of the European Data
   Directive [RAND-EDPD] points out that "the interpretation of location
   data (e.g. which locations are visited, suggesting which shops are
   frequented, and which products and services are bought), may in the
   future permit the identification of the health, social, sexual or
   religious characteristics of the data subject" (section 3.3.1).  The
   less well-known problem that this document focuses on is tracing the
   movement of mobile devices.  Because mobile devices are used for so
   many things, any possibility of tracing them has significant,
   probably unpredictable, social implications, perhaps more so than

   revealing a single location.  If an association can be made between a
   mobile device and a person at any location, if that device can be
   traced to a different geographic location then the association with
   the person can be inferred, usually correctly, even if the person
   believes they are anonymous at the new location.  Consider scenarios
   such as:

   o  You are looking for a job, interviewing at other companies over
      your lunch hour, but you don't want your current management to
      know.

   o  You are planning a surprise gift or party for your spouse and are
      visiting specialty stores.

   o  You are a journalist gathering information on a corrupt politician
      from sources who wish to hide that they are dealing with you.

   o  You are infiltrating an organized crime ring and don't want them
      to know when you sneak in the back door of police headquarters.

   o  You are a very famous person trying to avoid paparazzi and
      assassins who are able to find you sporadically.

   Mobility mechanisms need to take this issue into account.  Obviously
   a mobile node must be reachable somehow, but a mobile node must be
   able to hide its actual movement from public view if it wishes.


3.  Basic Mobility Requirements

   A mobile node may need to be reachable by others, or it may act
   purely as a client of Internet-based services.  Even if it is purely
   a client, it still needs at least two things:

   o  An authentication and authorization identifier that it can use
      with each access network it connects to.  (Not required for open
      access networks.)

   o  A Layer 3 way for its correspondents to get packets back to it.
      This may no longer be simple due to potential innovations in
      routing architecture.

   In addition, if the mobile node wants to be reachable as a peer or to
   offer services, it needs a few more things:

   o  An identifier (or identifiers) by which the node may be found by
      others, and a mechanism by which this identifier can be mapped to
      IP addresses/locators.  Examples are domain names, SIP URIs, and



Brim, et al.             Expires April 10, 2011                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            Mobility and Privacy              October 2010


      the corresponding services.

   o  An IP address/locator for initially contacting the mobile node.
      This does not have to be associated with the mobile node's actual
      topological location.  It can instead be associated with a
      rendezvous point or agent.

   o  A mechanism for "route optimization", whereby such an agent can be
      eliminated from a data path between the mobile node and a
      correspondent.

   o  An identifier or identifiers by which the mobile node can
      authenticate itself to its correspondents during initial contact,
      route optimization, and/or change of topological location.  These
      identifiers can be at any layer, from 2 to 7.  They can be
      associated with the mobile device's whole IP stack, individual
      transport sessions, or individual application instances.

   o  Identifiers by which the mobile node can be referred to by third
      parties.

   If all mobile nodes are reduced to being clients only -- if they are
   willing to register with servers in order to use the Internet and
   have others be able to reach them -- then there are fewer
   requirements.  However, over the evolution of the Internet we have
   seen several times that it is not good to give up the symmetry of
   Internet communication and "permission-free" networking, i.e. the
   ability for anyone anywhere to communicate as a peer with other nodes
   on the Internet.  For the rest of this document we assume that the
   IETF still wants to retain this model.

   Every identifier listed above has a scope in which it needs to be
   known, but it is only required to be known in that scope.  For
   example, an access authentication identifier only needs to be known
   to the mobile node, the access network, and a trusted third party (a
   mobile node's home network administration, or a bank, etc.).  A
   session identifier only needs to be known among the parties using it,
   but not by the access network.


4.  Avoiding Making a Mobile Node Traceable

   As a mobile node moves, if L3 or higher layer mobility mechanisms are
   used it will change its IP addresses/locators.  The Internet already
   has sophisticated publicly available services for determining where a
   node is based on IP address alone.  These mechanisms are not always
   precise or accurate, but they are in very many cases and even
   imprecise information is information.  Protocol designers must assume



Brim, et al.             Expires April 10, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            Mobility and Privacy              October 2010


   that whatever IP address or locator a node has, it is likely that
   there is a service to turn that into a geographic location.

   The tracing problem occurs when it is possible for a third party to
   correlate IP addresses/locators and something unique about the mobile
   node.  Data can be gathered either through monitoring traffic or by
   accessing public information.  It does not have to be done
   continuously -- periodic snapshots can make the mobile node just as
   vulnerable.  Once the data is gathered, the third party can search
   for correlations.

   Using identifiers for multiple purposes makes leakage of tracing
   information more likely.  Different entities in different scopes may
   know different things about a mobile node or a person.  Using
   overlapping identifiers mixes scopes and may make new, perhaps
   unexpected, correlations easier.  For example if an access identifier
   such as a mobile phone's IMEI (hard-coded and not changeable,
   primarily used for access authentication) is also used for session
   continuity, or is registered in an Internet database service that is
   publicly accessible, changes in that device's IP addresses (and thus
   geographic location) can be traced.

   Long-lasting identifiers make correlation easier as a device moves.
   They should not be used in scopes where they are not necessary.

   The biggest concern is if information that makes a mobile node
   traceable is required to be publicly available in order for the
   Internet to function.  If it is, it can be accessed not only without
   the mobile node's consent but even without its knowledge, perhaps
   without any audit trail of who is accessing the information that
   could be looked at after the fact.  Some architectures for mobility
   and/or routing and addressing described in
   [I-D.irtf-rrg-recommendation] assume the use of DNS or other public
   mapping systems.  In these, the mobile node is required to publish a
   mapping between its identifier and its current IP addresses/locators
   in order to be reachable, even if a mobile node is acting purely as a
   client (because otherwise packets would not get back to it).  This
   architectural assumption removes all of the mobile node's freedom of
   choice about how much confidentiality to preserve -- either it
   exposes all of its movement to all of the world or it is simply not
   reachable.  Public information systems like DNS are not designed to
   support confidentiality.

   MIPv6's "home agent" [I-D.ietf-mext-rfc3775bis] is an example of how
   to avoid this problem: Contact with a mobile node is initially
   through a home agent, a rendezvous point for both data and control
   traffic.  The home agent acts on behalf of the mobile node and
   encapsulates traffic to it.  After an exchange of packets, the mobile

Internet-Draft            Mobility and Privacy              October 2010


   node may decide, on its own, if it wants to reveal its topological
   location, and thus probably its geographic location, to the
   correspondent node.  It controls its own location information.  The
   decision to reveal it can be based on anything, including local
   policy.

   The principle of hiding information that can expose geographic
   location in both data and control planes, and deferring revealing
   more until the mobile node or its agent decides what it wants to do,
   is essential.  This can be included in any mobility architecture that
   is designed to allow it and does not insist on exposing location to a
   wide audience in order to gain efficiency.  The obvious way to do it
   is an indirection mechanism such as a home agent, but this is just
   one way to do it.  Any way will do.

   Monitoring is a more subtle issue than exposure in public services,
   but still real, even if the mobile node is client-only.  If packets
   contain an identifier that uniquely identifies the mobile node for
   some period of time, someone able to gather data on packet traffic
   can easily trace the mobile node's movements as the IP address/
   locator changes.  It is not necessary for the watcher to be able to
   gather this information in real time if it can access logs gathered
   by others.  Here, approaches to the problem are more difficult to
   define because there is a conflict between three goals: to avoid
   overhead, to preserve session continuity with low delay, and to keep
   control over location information.  Some designs such already try to
   find their balance.  All protocol work should consider the tradeoffs
   with privacy and explicitly find a balance point.


5.  Recommendations

   Members of the Internet community who are creating or reviewing
   proposed architectural changes, particularly in mobility but also in
   other areas that impinge on mobility such as routing and addressing,
   should consider the following points:

   o  Architectural changes MUST avoid requiring exposing a mapping
      between any of a node's identifiers and IP addresses/locators to
      unknown observers.  If they require exposure, they will experience
      a head-on collision with basic principles of the IETF and with
      privacy policies around the world.  It will simply not be
      acceptable to require the loss of this much individual privacy.

   o  An architectural proposal MAY make it possible to use public
      information systems to optimize traffic flow, but ideally it
      should do so without sacrificing privacy.  If it cannot do so
      without sacrificing privacy, the default case built into the

Internet-Draft            Mobility and Privacy              October 2010


      architecture SHOULD be to preserve privacy instead of optimizing.
      The reason is that most users will not change defaults, and the
      default be one of privacy, only moving away from it by customer
      choice.

   o  If possible, information about who is gathering data about a user
      SHOULD be available to that user.  Everyone deserves to know who
      is watching them.

   o  Proposals SHOULD address the issue of loss of geographic location
      privacy due to monitoring of packets crossing the Internet, and
      find an explicit balance between conflicting goals.

   o  Protocols SHOULD avoid using identifiers for multiple purposes.
      Different identifier scopes do not need to overlap.
      Confidentiality boundaries can be established by clearly defining
      limited interfaces.

   o  Protocols SHOULD avoid using long-lasting identifiers in scopes
      where they are not necessary.
