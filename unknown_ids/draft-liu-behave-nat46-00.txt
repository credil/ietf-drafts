Abstract

   The IPv4/IPv6 transisation period will last for a long time.
   Different phases of IPv4/IPv6 transisation have different scenarioes
   and requirements and need different solutions.  In the early stage of
   IPv4/IPv6 transisation, sicne the majority of Internet resoure
   locates in the IPv4 Internet, the main communication will be IPv6
   clients iniate communication to IPv4 servers.  But during the later
   stage of the transisation, the servers may locate in the IPv6
   network/Internet, in this scenario, there is a need for IPv4 client
   to iniate communication to IPv6 servers.  These document proposal
   solution to address this scenario.

                   Figure 1 NAT46 scenario.

   As figure 1 illustrated, the IPv4 client which locates in the IPv4
   network initiate communication to the IPv6 server which locates in
   the IPv6 Internet.  Current specifications, such as NAT64 cannot be
   used this scenario.  NAT-PT could address this scenario but due to
   the scalability and other issues, NAT-PT specification has been
   abolished.

   But in the later period of IPv4/IPv6 transition, it is clear that the
   NAT46 scenario will be needed.  This document proposes a solution to
   address this scenario.

3.  Terminology

   NAT46: refers to the scenario that IPv4 client initiate communication
   to IPv6 servers.  NAT46 GW: NAT46 gateway, refer to the entity that
   performs the IPv4/IPv6 translation.  Mapped-IPv4 address: Refers to
   the dynamically created IPv4 address that maps to the server's IPv6
   address.  This mapping information need to be synchronized with the
   NAT46 GW.

4. DNS46 consideration

   In the NAT46 scenario, the IPv4 client tries to communicate with an
   IPv6 server.  The IPv4 application will normally send type A DNS
   query.  Since the server is IPv6 only and has only type AAAA DNS
   record, there will be no type A DNS response thus the communication
   will not succeed.  There are there ways to solve this problem:

   1) NAT46 GW performs DNS ALG.

   It means that when the IPv4 with type A DNS query message arrives at
   the NAT46 GW, the NAT64 GW translates it into IPv6 and packet and
   change type A to AAAA.  If the DNS system returns AAAA response, the
   NAT46 GW will translate the IPv6 DNS response packet into IPv4 and
   create a mapping of the AAAA record and the mapped server IPv4
   address then return to the IPv4 host with the mapped A record.  The
   IPv4 client will use the mapped IPv4 address as the IPv6 server's IP
   address to start the communication.

   2) DNS46 performs DNS ALG.

   This means that there will be a DNS46 server in the network and
   performs the DNS ALG.  The IPv4 client's type A DNS query will
   arrives at DNS46, DNS46 will perform type A query, if there is no
   response, DNS46 will perform type AAAA query.  If there is a type
   AAAA DNS response, DNS46 will create a mapping between the returned
   IPv6 address and a dynamically generated IPv4 address.  Then DNS46
   will return the mapped type A DNS response message to the IPv4
   client.  The DNS46 needs to inform this mapping information to the
   NAT46 GW.  The IPv4 client will use this mapped IPv4 address to
   initiate the communication.

   3) Host performs DNS ALG.

   In this situation, the DNS ALG function resides in the host.  The
   IPv4 application in the IPv4 client send type A DNS query, when there
   is no response; the DNS ALG function in the host sends type AAAA DNS
   query, when a type AAAA DNS response is received, the DNS ALG
   function in the host create a mapping between the IPv6 address of the
   server and a domically created IPv4 mapping address.  The DNS ALG
   function in the host will then need to notify the NAT46 GW about the
   mapping information.

   The three different approaches have their own advantages and
   disadvantages:

   For the approach that performs DNS ALG in NAT46 GW, the main
   disadvantage is that it will add complexity to the NAT46 GW.  The

   advantage of this approach is that there is no synchronization
   mechanism needed and no need to change the host and DNS system.  The
   DNS46 approach's main advantage is that it reduces the complexity of
   the NAT46 and no change to the host.  The disadvantage of this
   approach is that it needs to introduce new DNS entity (DNS46) and
   need to synchronize the IPv6-IPv4 mapping information between the
   NAT46 GW and DNS46.  The advantage of host performing DNS ALG
   approach is that it reduces the complexity of the NAT46 GW and no
   need to change of DNS system.  The main disadvantage of this approach
   is that it requires changes to the host and also need to synchronize
   IPv6-IPv4 mapping information between the host and DNS46 GW.

   The synchronization mechanism between the DNS ALG and NAT46 GW need
   to be further identified.

5. NAT46 GW consideration

   NAT46 GW performs the translation function between IPv4 and IPv6.
   The NAT46 GW gets the mapping information of the server's IPv6
   address and IPv4 address by DNS ALG function ether resides in NAT46
   GW, DNS46 or host.  The IPv4 packets with the mapped-IPv4 address as
   its destination address will be routed to the NAT46 GW.  The NAT46 GW
   will first query its mapping table to seed whether there is a mapping
   entry of this IPv4 address.  When a mapping entry is found, the NAT46
   GW will translate the IPv4 destination address to its corresponding
   IPv6 destination address.  The IPv4 source address could be
   translated by adding a NAT46 GW prefix.

6. ALG consideration

   When there are IP addresses embedded in the payload, it will require
   the NAT46 GW to perform translation of the embedded IP address.
   NAT46 GW should support the most commonly used protocol's ALG.  It
   would not require the NAT46 GW to support all the ALGs due to the
   scalability and complexity restriction.
