Abstract

   This memo describes a backward-compatible technique that may be used
   by OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) implementations to advertise
   unavailability to forward transit traffic or to lower the preference
   level for the paths through such a router.  In some cases, it is
   desirable not to route transit traffic via a specific OSPF router.
   However, OSPF does not specify a standard way to accomplish this.

1.  Motivation

   In some situations, it may be advantageous to inform routers in a
   network not to use a specific router as a transit point, but still
   route to it.  Possible situations include the following:

   o  The router is in a critical condition (for example, has very high
      CPU load or does not have enough memory to store all LSAs or build
      the routing table).

   o  Graceful introduction and removal of the router to/from the
      network.

   o  Other (administrative or traffic engineering) reasons.

   Note that the proposed solution does not remove the router from the
   topology view of the network (as could be done by just flushing that
   router's router-LSA), but prevents other routers from using it for
   transit routing, while still routing packets to the router's own IP
   addresses, i.e., the router is announced as a stub.

   It must be emphasized that the proposed solution provides real
   benefits in networks designed with at least some level of redundancy
   so that traffic can be routed around the stub router.  Otherwise,
   traffic destined for the networks reachable through such a stub
   router will be still routed through it.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Proposed Solution

   The solution described in this document solves two challenges
   associated with the outlined problem.  In the description below,
   router X is the router announcing itself as a stub.

   1)  Making other routers prefer routes around router X while
       performing the Dijkstra calculation.

   2)  Allowing other routers to reach IP prefixes directly connected to
       router X.

   Note that it would be easy to address issue 1) alone by just flushing

   router X's router-LSA from the domain.  However, it does not solve
   problem 2), since other routers will not be able to use links to
   router X in Dijkstra (no back link), and because router X will not
   have links to its neighbors.

   To address both problems, router X announces its router-LSA to the
   neighbors with the costs of all non-stub links (links of the types
   other than 3) set to LSInfinity (16-bit value 0xFFFF, rather than 24-
   bit value 0xFFFFFF used in summary and AS-external LSAs).

   The solution above applies to both OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3
   [RFC5340].


4.  Compatibility issues

   Some inconsistency may be seen when the network is constructed of the
   routers that perform intra-area Dijkstra calculation as specified in
   RFC 1247 [RFC1247] (discarding link records in router-LSAs that have
   LSInfinity cost value) and routers that perform it as specified in
   RFC 1583 [RFC1583] and higher (do not treat links with LSInfinity
   cost as unreachable).  Note that this inconsistency will not lead to
   routing loops, because if there are some alternate paths in the
   network, both types of routers will agree on using them rather than
   the path through the stub router.  If the path through the stub
   router is the only one, the routers of the first type will not use
   the stub router for transit (which is the desired behavior), while
   the routers of the second type will still use this path.


5.  Security Considerations

   The technique described in this document does not introduce any new
   security issues into the OSPF protocol.


6.  Acknowledgements

   The authors of this document do not make any claims on the
   originality of the ideas described.  Among other people, we would
   like to acknowledge Henk Smit for being part of one of the initial
   discussions around this topic.

   We would also like to thank Shishio Tsuchiya, Gunter Van de Velde and
   Tomohiro Yamagata for reminding us of the need to document the OSPFv3
   behavior.
