                    EAP Type-Length-Value Container
                      draft-cam-winget-eap-tlv-00

Abstract

   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748,
   facilitates multiple authentication methods that are widely deployed
   today.  As tunnel mechanisms become more prevalent, there has been
   interest in carrying other types of data between the EAP Peer and the
   EAP server.  Existing tunnel EAP methods have already defined generic
   data structures to carry such information.

   This document defines a generic TLV "container" that can be used
   within an EAP method.

Internet-Draft                   EAP TLV                    January 2010


1.  Introduction

   Different authentication systems use the Extensible Authentication
   Protocol (EAP) framework to define tunnel authentication methods for
   establishing strong mutual authentication through the use of
   different authentication schemes including smart cards, One Time
   Passwords, cleartext passwords and others.  Tunnel EAP methods whose
   requirements are defined in [I-D.salowey-emu-eaptunnel-req] carry EAP
   methods and other authorization information such as channel binding
   that need an inner tunnel transport mechanism.  Other IETF groups
   have also expressed the need to carry other types of data between the
   EAP Peer and EAP Server.

   Tunnel EAP methods such as EAP-FAST [RFC4851] and EAP-TTLS [RFC5281]
   already use TLV structures to carry data.  EAP-TTLS overloads the
   Diameter AVP attribute type space, while EAP-FAST and other previous
   work, such as the one presented in "draft-hiller-eap-tlv" use a
   separate attribute type namespace.  This memo takes the approach of
   using the separate namespace used in EAP-FAST.


2.  Specification Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] .


3.  EAP Type-Length-Value Format and Support

   To allow for interoperability, the EAP Type-Length-Value (EAP-TLV)
   defines a container format used to carry arbitrary data between the
   EAP peer and the EAP server.  It is intended that this container be
   used only inside a protected EAP tunnel.

   The mandatory bit in an EAP-TLV indicates whether support of the EAP-
   TLV is required.  If the EAP Peer or Server does not support an EAP-
   TLV marked mandatory, then it MUST send a NAK TLV in the response,
   and all the other EAP-TLVs in the message MUST be ignored.  If an EAP
   Peer or Server finds an unsupported TLV which is marked as optional,
   it can ignore the unsupported EAP-TLV.  It MUST NOT send a NAK TLV
   for an EAP-TLV that is not marked mandatory.

   Note that an EAP Peer or Server may support an EAP-TLV with the
   mandatory bit set, but may not understand the contents.  The
   appropriate response to a supported EAP-TLV with content that is not
   understood is defined by the individual EAP-TLV specification.

Internet-Draft                   EAP TLV                    January 2010


   EAP implementations compliant with this specification MUST support
   EAP-TLV exchanges, as well as processing of mandatory/optional
   settings on the EAP-TLV.  Implementations conforming to this
   specification MUST support the following subset of EAP-TLVs defined
   in this document:


      NAK TLV

   EAP-TLVs are defined as described below.  The fields are transmitted
   from left to right.

         The value of the TLV.


5.  NAK TLV

   The NAK TLV allows an EAP Peer or Server to detect TLVs that are not
   supported by the other party.  An EAP packet can contain 0 or more
   NAK TLVs.  The NAK TLV is defined as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

      Vendor-Id

         The Vendor-Id field is four octets, and contains the Vendor-Id
         of the EAP-TLV that was not supported.  The high-order octet is
         0 and the low-order 3 octets are the SMI Network Management
         Private Enterprise Code of the Vendor in network byte order.
         The Vendor-Id field MUST be zero for EAP-TLVs that are not
         Vendor-Specific TLVs.


      NAK-Type

         The NAK-Type field is two octets.  The field contains the Type
         of the TLV that was not supported.  A TLV of this Type MUST
         have been included in the previous packet.


      TLVs

         This field contains a list of TLVs, each of which MUST NOT have
         the mandatory bit set.  These optional TLVs are for future
         extensibility to communicate why the offending TLV was
         determined to be unsupported.



6.  Error TLV

   The Error TLV allows an EAP Peer or Server to indicate errors to the
   other party.  For example, an error may occur if the EAP TLV contains
   information that can not be parsed or if the EAP Peer or Server
   received an unexpected EAP TLV.  An EAP packet can contain 0 or more

   the individual EAP method or EAP-TLV specification.  The Error TLV is
   defined as follows:

7.  Vendor-Specific TLV

   The Vendor-Specific TLV is available to allow vendors to support
   their own extended attributes not suitable for general usage.  A
   Vendor-Specific TLV attribute can contain one or more TLVs, referred
   to as Vendor TLVs.  The TLV-type of a Vendor-TLV is defined by the
   vendor.  All the Vendor TLVs inside a single Vendor-Specific TLV
   belong to the same vendor.  The can be multiple Vendor-Specific TLVs
   from different vendors in the same message.

   Vendor TLVs may be optional or mandatory.  Vendor TLVs sent with
   Result TLVs MUST be marked as optional.

   The Vendor-Specific TLV is defined as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

      Length

         >=4


      Vendor-Id

         The Vendor-Id field is four octets, and contains the Vendor-Id
         of the TLV.  The high-order octet is 0 and the low-order 3
         octets are the SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Code
         of the Vendor in network byte order.


      Vendor TLVs

         This field is of indefinite length.  It contains vendor-
         specific TLVs, in a format defined by the vendor.


8.  Security Considerations

   The EAP-TLV container can carry arbitrary data between an EAP Peer
   and the EAP server.  It is expected that the EAP TLVs defined in this
   document are carried by an EAP method that provides the required
   protection, such as an EAP tunnel method.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of EAP-TLV related values, in
   accordance with BCP 26, [RFC2434].

   The document defines a registry for EAP-TLV types, which may be
   assigned by Specification Required as defined in [RFC2434].
   Section 4 defines the TLV types that initially populate the registry.


10.  Acknowledgements

   The TLVs defined in this draft borrow from the work done in EAP-FAST.
   The authors would also like to recognize Tom Hiller, Ashwin Palekar
   and Glen Zorn for introducing this concept to the EAP WG back in
   2002.
