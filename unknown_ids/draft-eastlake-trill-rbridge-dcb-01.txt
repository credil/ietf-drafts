       RBridges: Support of IEEE 802.1Qbb, 802.1Qaz, and 802.1Qau
               <draft-eastlake-trill-rbridge-dcb-01.txt>


Abstract

   IEEE 802.1 is developing standards as part of its Data Center
   Bridging (DCB) activity that amend the IEEE 802.1Q standard. These
   include 802.1Qau, 802.1Qaz, and 802.1Qbb. The intent of these three
   standards is (1) to efficiently minimize data loss due to queue
   overflow for selected classes of traffic within Local Area Networks
   (LANs) meeting certain conditions and (2) to provide means to
   allocate the available bandwidth on links to different classes of
   traffic.

   IEEE 802.1 is specifying theses standards and the behavior needed to
   support them in bridges and end stations. This document briefly
   explains the standards and discusses the support of these standards
   in RBridges.

1. Introduction

   IEEE 802.1 is developing standards that amend IEEE [802.1Q] as part
   of its Data Center Bridging (DCB) activity. These include 802.1Qau,
   802.1Qaz, and 802.1Qbb. The intent of these three standards is (1) to
   efficiently eliminate data loss due to queue overflow for selected
   classes of traffic within Local Area Networks (LANs) having a limited
   delay bandwidth product and meeting other conditions and (2) to
   provide limited means to allocate the available bandwidth to
   different classes of traffic. Intended uses include the support of
   loss sensitive services, such as Fiber Channel over Ethernet [FCoE],
   in data centers.  Because they are primarily implemented at the
   802.1Q port level, no changes in the TRILL protocol are required to
   support IEEE 802.1Qbb or 802.1Qaz. To support 802.1Qau, some minor
   changes to TRILL, including an interworking function to handle one
   corner case, are specified.

   The existing optional PAUSE feature of IEEE 802.3 (Annex 31B of
   [802.3]) can, with appropriate engineering, provide Ethernet service
   without loss of frames due to queue overflow. However, PAUSE has
   problems as follows:

   1. Traffic for some protocols, for example TCP, require frame losses
      to signal congestion for flow control. Elimination of frame drops
      due to congestion would prevent TCP flow control, unless some
      other mechanism were added.

   2. Some traffic comprises time critical network control frames, for
      example BPDUs (Bridge Protocol Data Units). PAUSE is relatively
      indiscriminant and pauses such frames, except for some MAC Control
      frames such as PAUSE control frames themselves, along with pausing
      the loss sensitive multi-hop traffic that we are primarily worried
      about. This might compromise network connectivity.

   3. PAUSE can result in intermittent waves of spreading traffic
      paralysis, crippling network throughput, as follows: When a switch
      S1 receives a PAUSE on a port P1 and can no longer transmit frames
      out that port it is likely that output queues to P1 will fill up
      quickly. When that happens, to avoid frame loss, S1 must send
      PAUSE frames out on each of its ports that might receive a frame
      for output to P1. For example, it might have to PAUSE input on
      both P2 and P3, unnecessarily blocking traffic between those two
      ports, to be sure it will not receive input on either of them for
      P1. This can repeat in switches connected to S1, switches
      connected to those switches, etc.

INTERNET-DRAFT                         RBridges: Qbb, Qaz, & Qau Support


1.1 Overview of These Standards

   Overviews of the three DCB standards documents are given below. IEEE
   802.1 is specifying theses standards and the behavior needed to
   support them in bridges and end stations. This document discusses the
   support of these standards in RBridges [RFCtrill].

   IEEE [802.1Qbb], Priority-based Flow Control (PFC), DDS A refined
   version of the Ethernet PAUSE feature in a priority based fashion as
   described in Section 2. To the extent that a switch implements
   separate queues for different priorities at each port, this can
   eliminate the first and second problems above. Traffic requiring
   frame drops due to congestion can be assigned a priority for which
   PFC is not enabled. And PFC is not normally enabled for the two
   highest priorities, 6 and 7, which are typically used for time
   sensitive control frames. PFC also reduces the third problem as any
   congestion spreading would only affect the priority or priorities
   with PFC enabled.

   IEEE [802.1Qaz] is a standards document that actually covers two
   things. One, Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS), allocates
   bandwidth between traffic class groups indicated by priority. It is
   described in Section 3. The second, 802.1Qaz, contains the
   specification of the Data Center Bridging Exchange Protocol (DCBX)
   for discovering and configuring the three standards that this
   document covers, as described in Section 4.

   IEEE [802.1Qau], Congestion Notification, enables switches to manage
   congestion by signaling congestion on a per flow basis to end
   stations. As a part of the standard, participating end stations are
   required to implement per flow rate limiting that typically doesn't
   exist in currently deployed end stations.  802.1Qau is enabled on a
   per priority basis and, with appropriate engineering, minimizes frame
   drops due to queue overflow in a LAN Congestion Notification Domain
   within which all switches and end stations implement it. Thus
   802.1Qau and 802.1bb Priority-Based Flow Control complement each
   other, to help eliminate such frame drops. 802.1Qau tries to reduce
   congestion by proactively reducing frame ingress rates at the source
   end station(s). For some congestion cases this may be insufficient to
   stop buffer overflow at the congestions point. PFC provides an
   emergency brake for such cases and avoids frame loss. 802.1Qau
   eliminates the first problem listed above for PAUSE in that frames
   that require congestion drops can be assigned a priority for which
   802.1Qau is not enabled. It avoids the second problem because it is
   not normally used to limit priorities 6 and 7, which are typically
   used for time sensitive control frames. And it avoids the third
   problem listed above for PAUSE because it acts by restraining end
   station flow sources rather than blocking transmission on
   intermediate switch ports. Section 5 below provides additional
   information on 802.1Qau and specifies additions to the TRILL protocol


D. Eastlake, et al                                              [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         RBridges: Qbb, Qaz, & Qau Support


   to support it.

   These three DCB standards may be implemented independently or in any
   combination except that implementation of any of them implies
   implementation of DCBX, specified in IEEE 802.1Qaz.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



1.3 Additional Acronyms

   The following acronyms are used in this document in addition to those
   defined in [RFCtrill].

      AVB - Audio-Visual Bridging

      CNM - Congestion Notification Message

      DCB - Data Center Bridging

      DCBX - DCB Exchange protocol

INTERNET-DRAFT                         RBridges: Qbb, Qaz, & Qau Support


2. Priority-Based Flow Control

   IEEE [802.1Qbb], Priority-Based Flow Control (PFC), refines the IEEE
   802.3 PAUSE feature to permit separately requesting, on a physical
   link, pausing and unpausing the traffic of each of the eight
   available frame priority levels. The actual priority-based pause
   Ethernet control frame is being specified in [802.3bd].

   Such queue pausing occurs within the transmission logic associated
   with a port and requires no changes to the TRILL protocol, which is
   implemented above such port logic, as described in [RFCtrill].
   LLDP/DCBX is used in PFC discovery and agreement with peers as
   described in Section 4. A station implementing the PFC standard MUST
   implement DCBX, signaling PFC support and configuration. Guarantee of
   lossless handling of frames with a particular priority in an RBridge
   campus requires implementation and enablement of PFC for that
   priority at all end stations that originate frames and all RBridges
   and bridges in that campus as well as meeting the PFC engineering
   requirements specified in [802.1Qbb].

   The PFC control frames specified in 802.3bd are MAC control frames
   that are not VLAN tagged. Their transmission normally bypasses the
   output queue at a port so they are transmitted immediately, or as
   soon as the frame currently being transmitted is sent, so as to meet
   the timing requirements of PFC.

3. Enhanced Transmission Selection

   Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS), specified in IEEE [802.1Qaz],
   allocates bandwidth, between traffic classes, through each of the
   ports of a switch or end station. (To be more precise, it modifies
   the algorithm used to select, from multiple priority-based output
   queues at a port, the next frame to transmit. Provision is made for
   proprietary algorithms and 802.1 is specifying an algorithm in
   connection with precise frame timing (AVB), but we are only concerned
   with the default DCB algorithm.)

   Transmission selection occurs within the logic associated with a port
   and requires no changes to the TRILL protocol, which is implemented
   above such port logic, as described in [RFCtrill]. An RBridge
   implementing the ETS standard MUST implement DCBX (see Section 4)
   signaling of ETS support and configuration. For ETS to be effective,
   traffic in different ETS groups cannot share an output queue.



4. The DCB Exchange Protocol

   The DCB Exchange Protocol (DCBX) is specified in IEEE [802.1Qaz],
   which also specifies ETS as described in Section 3.

   DCBX is built on the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), which is
   specified in IEEE [802.1AB]. DCBX is used for the discovery of DCB
   capabilities of peer switches, for the detection of inconsistent
   configuration of DCB features between peer switches, and for the
   propagation of DCB features to switches configured to accept
   configuration via DCBX. For purposes of TRILL protocol peering,
   RBridges ignore intervening bridges, but for the purposes of LLDP and
   DCBX all stations, including RBridges, 802.1 bridges, and end
   stations are considered peers.

   RBridges implementing any of the three DCB protocols MUST also
   implement DCBX.

5. Congestion Notification

   Congestion Notification, IEEE [802.1Qau], can limit flows to minimize
   frame loss by having congestion points that detect congestion and
   send congestion notification messages back to reaction points in end
   stations that can limit flows. See [802.1Qau] for the specification
   of the algorithms to perform at congestion and reaction points.
   Congestion Notification is designed to operate best in minimizing
   frame loss of unicast flows in a LAN composed of point-to-point
   physical links where all switches have implemented Congestion
   Notification.

   An RBridge that implements Congestion Notification may act as an end
   point, for example when sourcing or sinking SNMP management frames,
   and thus may contain one or more reaction points, as well as
   implementing congestion points at its output queues.

   Reaction points are in end stations where flows originate and are the
   mechanism to limit flows. The granularity of reaction points is
   beyond the scope of IEEE 802.1Qau and this document but cannot be
   larger than a priority at a MAC address. If the granularity is
   smaller and there are multiple reaction points in an end station for
   a given priority, then the end station must label outgoing frames
   with a Congestion Notification tag (CNtag) that includes an end
   station flow ID. This flow ID is an opaque field to the rest or the
   network.  Reaction points are typically implemented within the native
   frame origination logic of an end station.

    Figure 1: Native Ethernet Frame in a Congestion Notification Domain


   Congestion points are at queues in forwarding devices, normally port
   output queues. The functions of a congestion point are (1) to
   conditionally send Congestion Notification Messages (CNMs) to the
   source of a frame and (2) to conditionally strip Congestion
   Notification tags (CNtags) out of a frame being forwarded, for
   example if it is being forwarded out of a congestion notifiation
   domain.

   When a frame is to be inserted into an output queue with a congestion


D. Eastlake, et al                                              [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         RBridges: Qbb, Qaz, & Qau Support


   point, the procedures specified in IEEE 802.1Qau are used to
   determine if a CNM should be sent to the frame's source and if so to
   determine various fields in that CNM. When a frame is to be inserted
   into an output queue with a congestion point, the congestion point
   may remove any CNtag in the frame as discussed in Section 5.1.
   Congestion points are implemented within the logic associated with a
   port and require no changes to the TRILL protocol for the output of
   native frames, as TRILL is implemented above such port logic as
   described in [RFCtrill]; however, when outputting a TRILL data frame,
   any CNM generated needs to be for the TRILL encapsulated frame rather
   than for the entire TRILL data frame and the CNM needs to be TRILL
   encapsulated. Thus there are some differences between the details of
   the creation of a CNM at an RBridge output port and at a bridge
   output port.

                           Figure 2: Native CNM


   Within a contiguous part of the campus where Congestion Notification
   is enabled (see Section 5.1), you would see the same frames with the
   same tags as in a similar bridged LAN except that those frames will
   be TRILL encapsulated as shown in Figures 3 and 4. The exception is
   when a TRILL-ignorant bridge within the campus produces a CNM in
   response to a TRILL data frame as shown in Figure 6. The resulting
   CNM is adjusted by the first RBridge it encounters, which will be the
   previous-hop RBridge.



5.1 Congestion Notification Domains

   IEEE 802.1Qau reduces frame drops due to output queue overflow in a
   Congestion Notification Domain. There could be many such domains,
   each limited to a specific priority value and contiguous set of
   network stations (end stations, RBridges, or 802.1 bridges), within
   an RBridge campus. For example, two Congestion Notification Domains,
   one at priority X and one at priority Y, could cover the same set of
   contiguous stations, overlapping but different sets of such stations,


D. Eastlake, et al                                             [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         RBridges: Qbb, Qaz, & Qau Support


   or completely disjoint sets of such stations, in a campus.

   IEEE 802.1Qau includes mechanisms to "defend" Congestion Notification
   Domains, that is, make sure only congestion managed flows of frames
   enter congestion point queues. The edge of a domain, i.e. the set of
   station ports in the domain connected by a physical link to a station
   not in the domain, is determined by a combination of auto-detection
   using LLDP (see Section 4) and management configuration. Bridges that
   implement Congestion Notification defend a domain by (1) prohibiting
   priority mapping inside the domain, (2) mapping the priority of any
   frame entering the domain from a station outside the domain to a
   priority that is not a congestion managed priority, and (3)
   prohibiting the mapping of the priority of any frame entering the
   domain from a station outside the domain to the domain's priority.

   Note that, because of item 2 in the previous paragraph, a station can
   be a member of no more than 7 different Congestion Notification
   Domains because there must be at least one priority that is not
   congestion managed for use as the mapped priority of entering frames
   from outside the domain and which are therefore not part of a
   congestion managed flow. As a practical matter, it is unlikely that a
   station would be a member of more than 4 or 5 different Congestion
   Notification Domains as priorities 6 and 7 are normally used for high
   priority control frames and are not congestion controlled and at
   least one low priority is kept not congestion managed for mapping as
   above.

   The per port per priority state of a switch or end station will be
   one of the following four values, which have the effects indicated:

   o  Disabled:
      -  On native frame input, frame priority can be mapped to or from
         this priority.
      -  If this is an end-station output port, CNtags are not added.
      -  If this is a switch output port, CNtags are not stripped.

   o  Edge:
      -  On native frame input, a frame with this priority is mapped to
         a non-congestion control priority and no native frame can be
         mapped to this priority, regardless of the priority-mapping
         table at the port. For TRILL Data frames, this also applies to
         the Inner.VLAN priority.
      -  If this is an end-station output port, CNtags are not added.
      -  If this is a switch output port, CNtags are stripped including
         any CNtag in the encapsulated frames if a TRILL Data frame is
         being output.

INTERNET-DRAFT                         RBridges: Qbb, Qaz, & Qau Support


   o  Interior:
      -  On frame input, a frame in this priority is not mapped to
         another priority and no frame can be mapped to this priority,
         regardless of the priority-mapping table at this port.  For
         TRILL Data frames, this also applies to the Inner.VLAN
         priority.
      -  If this is an end-station output port, CNtags are not added.
      -  If this is a switch output port, CNtags are strippedd including
         any CNtag in the encapsulated frames if a TRILL Data frame is
         being output.

   o  InteriorReady:
      -  On frame input, a frame in this priority is not mapped to
         another priority and no frame can be mapped to this priority,
         regardless of the priority-mapping table at this port.  For
         TRILL Data frames, this also applies to the Inner.VLAN
         priority.
      -  If this is an end-station output port, CNtags may be added.
      -  If this is a switch output port, CNtags are not stripped.

   Note that when the priority of a TRILL encapsulated frame is mapped,
   the priority field in the Inner.VLAN tag MUST be changed.



5.2 Congestion Notification Tag Details

   An end station originating a native frame may add a Congestion
   Notification tag (CNtag), if the end station and the next hop device
   are part of a Congestion Domain, to identify the reaction point in
   that end station that controls the end station flow to which that
   native frame belongs. A CNtag is 4 bytes long, consisting of a 2
   bytes Ethertype (0x22E9) followed by a 2 bytes flow ID, and appears
   after any VLAN tag but before the frame body. The inclusion of a
   CNtag is optional as the originating end station may be able to
   identify the corresponding reaction point from other information
   returned in a Congestion Notification Message such as the priority.

   As described in Section 5.3, CNtags are always added to Congestion
   Notification Messages (CNM) when they are created.



5.3 Congestion Notification Message Details

   A Congestion Notification Message (CNM) is, under certain
   circumstances, created by a congestion point, as described in IEEE
   802.1Qau, for frame is entered into the queue associated with that
   congestion point. The complete CNM frame always includes a Congestion
   Notification tag (CNtag, see Section 5.2). The CNtag includes a zero


D. Eastlake, et al                                             [Page 12]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         RBridges: Qbb, Qaz, & Qau Support


   flow id if the frame provoking the CNM did not have a CNtag. The body
   of the CNM itself, after the CNtag, starts with the CNM Ethertype
   (0x22E7) followed by the information below:

      -  CNM version information, currently zero
      -  Quantized congestion feedback information as specified in IEEE
         802.1Qau
      -  An 8 byte opaque ID of the congestion point generating the CNM
      -  The priority of the frame causing the CNM
      -  The destination MAC address of the frame causing the CNM
      -  The number of bytes included from the beginning of the body of
         the frame causing the CNM
      -  The first up to 64 bytes of the body of the frame causing the
         CNM

   Except that input bytes/frame counters are not incremented, a CNM
   generated at an output queue for a port is treated as if it had been
   received on that port above the EISS. CNMs are considered to be in
   the same VLAN as the frame that provoked them and have configurable
   priority that defaults to priority 6.

   It is undesirable, but not an error, for a CNM to be sent in response
   to a CNM frame which encounters congestion. This is normally avoided
   by sending CNM frames with a priority which does not have congestion
   notification enabled.

   As described in Section 5.4.1.3 below, when a CNM is generated by an
   RBridge when queuing a TRILL data frame, it is generated for the
   enclosed frame, not for the entire TRILL data frame. This will cause
   the CNM to be addressed to the source end station of the data.



5.4 Additions to TRILL for Congestion Notification

   The figure below is used in the discussion in this section. The
   assumption is that a frame is generated at End Station "a" (ESa)
   destined for End Station "b" (ESb) and this frame is forwarded
   through the sequence of 802.1 bridges (Bn) and RBridges (RBn) shown.
   For native frames from ESa, RB1 acts as the ingress RBridge,
   encapsulating and directing them to egress RBridge RB3 for
   decapsulation and delivery to ESb. The arrows indicate the flow of a
   data frame. Any resulting CNM will flow in the opposite direction.

                          Figure 5: Example Frame Path

   TRILL can make no difference to the actions at any reaction points in
   ESa or any congestion points at the output queues of B1, B2, or B3,
   since they are not RBridges, although any Congestion Notification
   Message (CNM) generated at B2 will be in response to a TRILL frame
   and will need adjustment at the previous hop RBridge. The situation
   at the output queue of RB3 is actually the same as B3 since, as
   egress, RB3 will have decapsulated any traffic for ESb before it
   tries to insert it in an output queue. Thus the frame RB3 is
   enqueuing will be a native frame, a congestion point at the RB3
   output can act, for such a frame, exactly as an 802.1 bridge
   congestion point, and any CNM generated in the RB3 output from that
   native frame will be treated as if it was received by the RB3 port.

   A CNM created at the RB1 or RB2 output queue is straightforward.
   Assume the CNM is created in response to TRILL frame 1 (TF1) and the
   TF1 encapsulates native frame 1 (NF1). The CNM would be created as a
   TRILL encapsulated CNM with the ingress RBridge of TF1 as its egress.
   The Inner.MacDA would be ESa. The Inner.MacSA would be the MAC
   address of the port on which the TRILL encapsulated CNM was initially
   sent, that is, the same as the Outer.MacSA. The encapsulated CNM
   itself would be filled in as if in response to NF1, not TF1.

   Similarly, a CNM created at B3 would have ESa as its destination
   address and would be encapsulated when it arrived at RB3 as RB3 would
   be its ingress RBridge.



5.4.1 RBridge Ingress Details

   This section specifies special actions for Congestion Notification at
   an RBridge input port receiving a native frame, that is, the RBridge
   ingress function. The usual 802.1Q processing on the priority of the
   input TRILL data frame, modified as described in Section 5.1, is
   done. Special actions are required only when the native frame
   received is a CNM.

   The ingress process at an RBridge, say RB2, supporting Congestion


D. Eastlake, et al                                             [Page 14]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         RBridges: Qbb, Qaz, & Qau Support


   Notification MUST detect the case of a native CNM created by a bridge
   in response to a TRILL frame, say by B2 in Figure 5, and transform or
   discard it as described below. If such a CNM was generated in
   response to a TRILL control (IS-IS) frame, it is discarded. No other
   changes are needed in the RBridge ingress process.

   Such a native CNM requiring special actions is easily recognized as
   it's MAC destination address will be the RBridge and it will have the
   CNM Ethertype. (A CNM not addressed to the RBridge must have been
   generated in response to an unencapsulated native frame, for example
   at B3 in the diagram above, and can be encapsulated and generally
   forwarded by transit Rbridges in the same way as other native frame.)

   Such a native CNM resulting from a TRILL data frame at B2 has the
   contents generally shown in Figure 6 and listed further below.

   Because of the reduction in the number of bytes of the body of the

   is RECOMMENDED that bridges and RBridges implementing Congestion
   Notification in a campus be configured to include the maximum (64)
   number of bytes when generating a CNM.



5.4.2 Transit RBridge Details

   The subsections below describe transit RBridge support of Congestion
   Notification at input and output ports. As this is considering an

INTERNET-DRAFT                         RBridges: Qbb, Qaz, & Qau Support


   RBridge in its transit role, only the handling of TRILL data frames
   is discussed. If the RBridge is receiving a native frame, it will be
   an ingress as described in Section 5.4.2 and if it is sending a
   native frame, it will be an egress as described in Section 5.4.3.
   However, this section does apply to the output of an encapsulated
   frame that was ingressed at an RBridge and to the input, in TRILL
   encapsulated form, of a frame to be egressed at the RBridge.



5.4.2.1 Transit RBridge Input Port

   The usual 802.1Q processing on the priority of the input TRILL data
   frame, modified as described in Section 5.1, is done.



5.4.2.2 Transit RBridge Output Port

   As discussed in Section 5.1, a CNtag is stripped under some
   circumstances; however, such a CNtag will appear as part of the
   encapsulated frame, not on the outside of the TRILL data frame, so
   the CNtag is stripped from deeper in the frame.  When there is a
   Congestion Point enabled at an RBridge output queue a CNM is not
   generated as the result of trying to queue a TRILL control (IS-IS)
   frame for output at an RBridge. A TRILL encapsulated CNM is generated
   in response to a TRILL Data frame composed as below, when to do so is
   specified by 802.1Qau. The TRILL Data frame causing the CNM is
   referred to as TF1 and its encapsulated native frame as NF1.

      + Outer.MacDA - MAC address of the next hop RBridge towards the
        egress nickname used in the TRILL Header (see below)
      + Outer.MacSA - MAC address of the output port on which the TRILL
        encapsulated CNM is to be sent
      + Outer.VLAN - Designated VLAN of the link on which the TRILL
        encapsulated CNM is to be sent
      + TRILL Header
           o TRILL Ethertype 0x22F3
           o Flags, hop count, options length
           o Egress nickname, from ingress nickname in TF1
           o Ingress nickname, a nickname of the RBridge generating the
             CNM
           o Options, if any
      + Inner.MacDA - set to the Inner.MacSA of TF1, that is, the source
        MAC address of NF1
      + Inner.MacSA - same as Outer.MacSA of TF1
      + Inner.VLAN - same as the Inner.VLAN of TF1, that is, the VLAN
        tag of NF1
      + CNtag - with flow ID from the CNtag of NF1 or zero if NF1 did
        not have a CNtag

5.4.3 RBridge Egress Details

   After decapsulation, processing of the decapsulated native frame is
   the same as at an 802.1 bridge output port. As discussed in Section
   5.1, any CNtag present is stripped under some circumstances. If the
   output queue is congested, then a native CNM may be generated in
   response to the decapsulated native frame. This native CNM will then
   be treated as if it had been received on the port.
