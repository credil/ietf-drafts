Abstract

   P2P Streaming has become popular application in the Internet.
   Currently, most home subscribers access Internet via ADSL, in which
   downlink bandwidth and uplink bandwidth are not symmetric.  This
   feature would influence the performance of P2P Streaming, and the
   problem may be worse in mobile scenarios.  This draft presents the
   interoperation between PPSP protocol and DECADE protocol to provide
   DECADE service for PPSP applications.  Typically, there are two
   solution to achieve interoperation, loose interoperation among peers,
   and close interoperation via connection of peer and tracker.  By
   introducing DECADE in both tracker protocol and peer protocol, PPSP
   streaming can alleviate strength of upload bandwidth and improve
   performance for fix and mobile scenario.

Internet-Draft            PPSP Usage for DECADE               March 2011


1.  Introduction

   P2P Streaming has become popular application in the Internet.
   Currently, most home subscribers access Internet via ADSL, in which
   downlink bandwidth and uplink bandwidth are not symmetric.  This
   feature would influence the performance of P2P Streaming, for P2P
   applications are based on symmetric collaboration among peers.  The
   problem may be worse in mobile scenarios.  The wireless channels are
   more symmetric, and the mobility of device leads to the churn of
   networks [I-D.lu-ppsp-mobile].

   DECADE is an open, standard protocol to access in-network storage for
   P2P application data access that is decoupled from P2P application
   control and signaling [I-D.ietf-decade-problem-statement].  DECADE
   can provide infrastructure support and save usage of last-mile
   uplink.  [I-D.chen-decade-intgr-livestr-exmp] and
   [I-D.huang-decade-integration-example] presents instance of P2P
   Streaming integration with DECADE.  However, these integration
   examples focus on the modification of peer protocol to support in-
   network storage for P2P Streaming.

   This draft presents the interoperation between PPSP protocol and
   DECADE protocol to provide DECADE service for PPSP applications.  In
   this model, Peer has its own DECADE server.  When Peer registers to
   Tracker, it would carry additional information of DECADE server, such
   as availability, content, or authorized token.  Then Tracker would
   store the information to enable in-network storage functions.  In the
   data transfer process, there are two ways to achieve interoperation
   of DECADE and PPSP, loose interoperation via peer communication and
   close interoperation via the connection of peer and tracker.  By
   introducing DECADE in both tracker protocol and peer protocol, PPSP
   streaming can alleviate strength of upload bandwidth and improve
   performance for fix and mobile scenario.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document makes extensive use of the terminology and definitions
   from PPSP Problem Statements [I-D.ietf-decade-problem-statement],
   PPSP Tracker Protocol [I-D.gu-ppsp-tracker-protocol] and DECADE
   Architecture [I-D.alimi-decade-arch].  The additional definitions are

   o  Tracker: Tracker maintain not only peer status defined in PPSP
      Tracker, but also include the information of DECADE server.

   o  Peer: Due to the existence of in-network storage, Peer should
      interact with DECADE entities.  Also, streaming data transfer via
      the communication between DECADE servers, instead of communication
      between peers directly.

   o  DECADE Server: DECADE Server provides in-network storage service
      and relevant access control and resource schedule scheme as
      defined in DECADE architecture.


3.  Reference Model

   This document provides the transparent combination of PPSP
   architecture and DECADE architecture to introduce in-network storage
   for PPSP service.  As shown in Figure 1, there are three entities in
   the system, tracker, DECADE server and peer.

   maintain the information of peers and their DECADE servers to enable

   in-network storage functions.  When peer request initial peer list,
   tracker return optimal list based on the knowledge of DECADE server.
   If peer decide to require content from particular DECADE server, it
   requests authorized token by communicating with target peer or asking
   tracker directly.  After peer gets authority of data request, peer
   generate content retrieve request via DECADE server.  DECADE server
   retrieves content on behalf of peer by DECADE protocol and transfer
   content to peer.


4.  Interoperation Solution

   There are two ways to achieve interoperation of DECADE and PPSP,
   loose interoperation and close interoperation.

4.1.  Loose Interoperation

   Peer reports its DECADE availability to tracker and tracker only
   knows whether peer has enabled DECADE service.  Then tracker return
   peer list including DECADE availability.  Peer check peer list and
   select DECADE-enable peer with priority.  Then peer communicate with
   each other to get DECADE authority and conduct data transfer.  In
   this solution, tracker has no knowledge about the detail of DECADE
   server, that is, "loose interoperation".

4.1.1.  Protocol Description

   To fulfill this purpose, only tracker protocol should be revised:

   1.  When peer connects to tracker, it should inform about DECADE
       availability.  The method specific XML of the CONNECT request
       takes the form shown below:

               <PeerID>###</PeerID>
                  <DECADE_Avail>
                      ON or OFF
                  </DECADE_Avail>

   2.  When peer request initial peer list, tracker should response list
       including DECADE status.  The method specific XML of the FIND
       response takes the form shown below:

               <SwarmID>###</SwarmID>
                  <Peer>
                     Peer list with DECADE_Status
                  </Peer>

Internet-Draft            PPSP Usage for DECADE               March 2011


4.1.2.  Message Flow

   Peer communicates with tracker as PPSP tracker protocol
   [I-D.gu-ppsp-peer-protocol] defined.  After peer receives peer list
   and selects target peer, it communicates with corresponding peer
   according to data transfer scenarios defined in
   [I-D.ietf-decade-problem-statement].  Typically, there are four
   methods as bellow:

   o  If both request peer and target peer has implemented DECADE
      server, message transfer follows Usage Scenario 1 (Sender and
      receiver Accounts used);

   o  If request peer has not implemented DECADE server but target peer
      has, message transfer follows Usage Scenario 2 (Sender account
      used);

   o  If request peer has implemented DECADE server but target peer has
      not, message transfer follows Usage Scenario 3 (Receiver account
      used);

   o  If neither request peer nor target peer has implemented DECADE
      server, message transfer follows Usage Scenario 4 (no storage
      accounts used).

4.2.  Close Interoperation

   Peer reports detailed information of DECADE server to tracker, like
   stored content, address, and authorized token.  Tracker returns both
   peer list and DECADE server list, including DECADE information.  Peer
   request target DECADE server with authorized token based on its
   scheduling algorithms.  After peer down any data, it uploads content
   to its DECADE server.  In this solution, tracker maintains overall
   status of peers and related DECADE server, that is, _loose
   interoperation_.

4.2.1.  Protocol Description

   In close interoperation solution, data transfer would not go through
   the connection among peer.  Then peer protocol lack data transfer
   function, only providing neighborhood maintain and exchange of peer
   list.  Also, tracker protocol should be revised to adapt demand of
   DECADE server.

   1.  When peer connects to tracker, it should inform about detailed
       DECADE information.  The revised method specific XML of the
       CONNECT request takes the form shown below:

Internet-Draft            PPSP Usage for DECADE               March 2011


               <PeerID>###</PeerID>
                  <DECADE_Info>
                      Authorized token
                      Address
                  </DECADE_Info>

   2.  When peer request initial peer list, tracker should response list
       including DECADE information.  Tracker also inform peer about
       content store in DECADE server.  The revised method specific XML
       of the FIND response takes the form shown below:

               <SwarmID>###</SwarmID>
                  <PeerID>###</PeerID>
                     <DECADE_Info>
                        Content ID
                        Authorized token
                        Address
                     </DECADE_Info>

   3.  Tracker should update DECADE status periodically to get the
       latest content availability.  The revised method specific XML of
       the STAT_REPORT response takes the form shown below:

               <PeerID>###</PeerID>
                  <Stats>
                      <Stat property="DECADE_STAT">***</Stat>
                         List of Content ID
                      ...more stats...
                  </States>

4.2.2.  Message Flow

   Either peer or P2P application vendor can implement DECADE server to
   provide in-network service.  So there are two scenarios.

4.2.2.1.  DECADE server belongs to peer

   In this section, we consider the case of a peer A requesting data
   from peer B's DECADE server.  We use Sb to denote peer B's DECADE
   server.  Message flows are shown as follows:

   1.  Tracker sends DECADE update request periodically to update DECADE
       status.

   2.  If there is any update, peer B uploads content to Sb.

   3.  When content is uploaded successfully, Sb returns OK to Peer B.

   4.  Peer B return DECADE update response to tracker and tracker
       update Sb's status.

   5.  Peer A sends FIND message to get initial peer list.

   6.  Tracker responds FIND request, and returns peer list including
       Sb's information.

   7.  Peer A checks peer list and select Sb as content provider.  Then
       Peer A send data transfer request to Sb with authorized token.

   8.  Sb checks authorized token and accept data transfer request.
       Then Peer A and Sb build connection and begin to transfer data.

                  Message Flow with peer's DECADE server

4.2.2.2.  DECADE sever belongs to P2P application vendor

   In this section, we consider the case of a peer A requesting data
   from DECADE server of P2P vendor.  We use Sp to denote peer B's
   DECADE server, which play a role of super node of P2P vendor.
   Message flows are shown as follows:

   1.  Tracker sends status request to Sp for update Sp's content
       status.  In this step, tracker acts as DECADE client of Sp.  It

       utilizes DECADE protocol to communicate with Sp.

   2.  Sp send content update request to get recent content within P2P
       vendor.

   3.  If there is any update content within P2P vendor, Sp download
       content from P2P vendor.

   4.  Sp return status response to tracker and tracker update Sp's
       status.

   5.  Peer A send FIND request to get initial peer list.

   6.  Tracker return peer list to Peer A, containing Sp's information
       and authorized token.

   7.  Peer A checks peer list and select Sp as content provider.  Then
       Peer A send data transfer request to Sp with authorized token.

   8.  Sp checks authorized token and accept data transfer request.
       Then Peer A and Sp build connection and begin to transfer data.

5.  Open Issues

   o  Recently DECADE protocol support pull-based P2P streaming.  How to
      enhance DECADE protocol to support push-based P2P streaming
      applications as well?  In push-based model, peer should transfer
      data to its descendants whenever it receives data.  Then DECADE
      protocol should support one-to-many data relay.
