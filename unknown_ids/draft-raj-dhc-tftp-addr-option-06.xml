    <abstract>
      <t>This memo documents existing usage for the "TFTP Server Address
      Option". The option number currently in use is 150. This memo documents
      the current usage of the option in agreement with RFC 3942 <xref
      target="RFC3942"></xref>, which declares that any pre-existing usages of
      option numbers in the range 128 - 223 should be documented and the
      working group will try to officially assign those numbers to those
      options. The option is defined for DHCPv4 and works only with IPv4
      addresses.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Voice over IP ("VoIP") devices, such as IP phones, have a need to
      download their configuration from a configuration server on the network.
      There are commonly accepted methods to discover this server via DHCP;
      the "sname" field in the DHCP header <xref target="RFC2131"></xref>, the
      "TFTP Server name" option (#66) <xref target="RFC2132"></xref>. Both of
      these sources of information, however, contain the TFTP server's
      hostname. That hostname must then be translated to an IP address. The
      usual method to accomplish this would be DNS <xref
      target="RFC1034"></xref>. This means the firmware in a VoIP device (with
      possibly limited flash, memory, and/or processing resources) would need
      to implement the DNS protocol in order to perform this translation. This
      would also introduce an additional unnecessary point of failure whereby
      the device is dependent on the DNS server infrastructure in order to
      boot up and communicate with its call agent.</t>

      <t>In order to eliminate DNS as a point of failure and keep the firmware
      in such a VoIP device to a minimum the "VoIP Configuration Server
      Address" option (150) was introduced. This option allows the DHCP server
      to pass one or more IP addresses of the VoIP Configuration Server(s)
      instead of the hostname, thus making the information directly usable by
      the VoIP device.</t>

      <t>Other reasons for this option are that, (1) the "siaddr" field is not
      configurable on some DHCP servers, (2) the "siaddr" field only allows
      for one IPv4 address and it is desirable to have the ability to
      configure multiple IP addresses for redundancy, (3) some DHCP servers
      have been found to fill in their own IPv4 address as siaddr, (4) some
      customers were already using the "siaddr" field for other purposes, and
      finally (5) the configuration server may use a protocol other than TFTP
      to serve configuration files, making the use of the "TFTP Server name"
      option (option code 66) inappropriate.</t>

      <t>In cases where other download server address information also appears
      in the response packet, such as "sname" and "TFTP Server name", it is
      left to the device to decide which piece of information to use.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Conventions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="TFTP Server Address Option Definition">
      <t>The TFTP Server Address option is a DHCP option <xref
      target="RFC2132"></xref>. The option contains one or more IPv4 addresses
      which the client MAY use. The current use of this option is for
      downloading configuration from a VoIP server via TFTP, however the
      option may be used for purposes other than contacting a VoIP
      Configuration Server.</t>

      <figure anchor="format">
        <preamble>The format of the option is:</preamble>

        <artwork><![CDATA[
 Code   Len   IPv4 Configuration Server Address(es)
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| 150 |  n  |     IPv4 address      | ...
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>The option minimum length (n) is 4.</t>

      <t>The "Len" field must specify a length which is an integral multiple
      of 4 octets (4, 8, 12, etc.). If an option is received where this is not
      the case, the option information MUST be ignored, but further option
      processing may continue. Dividing this "Len" value by 4 will give number
      of IPv4 VoIP Configuration Server addresses which are specified in the
      option.</t>

      <t>The option MUST NOT be specified by the DHCP Client as it is intended
      only to be returned from the DHCP Server. If the DHCP Client wants to
      receive this information from the server, it needs to include the number
      150 in the DHCP "Parameter List" option (55).</t>

      <t>Server addresses SHOULD be listed in order of preference and the
      client SHOULD use the addresses sequentially but may be configurable to
      use addresses randomly. The client may use as many or as few of the
      addresses provided as it likes. For example, if client is only capable
      of accepting 2 configuration server addresses, it may ignore any other
      addresses provided after the second address.</t>

      <t>Each TFTP server address which is being used by the client should be
      tried a total of 4 times with a 4 second wait time before proceeding to
      the next address.</t>

      <t>When this option appears along with the TFTP Server Name option
      (option 66) <xref target="RFC2132"></xref>, this option SHOULD have
      priority over option 66.</t>

      <t>There is currently no defined IPv6 DHCP equivalent of this
      option.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>A rogue DHCP Server could use this option in order to coerce a Client
      into downloading configuration from an alternate Configuration Server
      and thus gain control of the device's configuration. This, however, is
      no more of a security threat than similar attacks using other DHCP
      options which specify server names or addresses, of which there are
      many. If this is a concern, then DHCP Authentication may be used, but
      even secure delivery of an address over DHCP does not protect the
      subsequent insecure download over TFTP. TFTP itself provides no
      authentication or access control mechanisms, so even if DHCP messages
      were authenticated, downloading the configuration would still be
      insecure, unless some object-level security mechanisms would be
      used.</t>

      <t>Where security concerns are an issue, it is suggested that
      configuration files should be signed by a trusted agent. Configuration
      files may also be encrypted based on a configuration parameter on the
      DHCP client device. In other words, there are various methods to ensure
      the integrity of configuration data independent from insuring the
      integrity of the this DHCP option or even DHCP itself. The full extent
      of such options is far too broad to be addressed in this document.</t>

      <t>Message authentication in DHCP for intradomain use where the out-of-
      band exchange of a shared secret is feasible and is defined in <xref
      target="RFC3118"></xref>. Potential exposures to attack are discussed in
      section 7 of the DHCP protocol specification in <xref
      target="RFC2131"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is requested to assign DHCP option number 150 for this option,
      in accordance with <xref target="RFC3942"></xref>.</t>
