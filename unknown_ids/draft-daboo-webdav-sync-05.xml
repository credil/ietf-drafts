Collections can be of arbitrary size and depth (i.e., collections within collections).        WebDAV clients that cache resource content need a way to synchronize that data with the server (i.e., detect what has changed        and update their cache). This can currently be done using a WebDAV PROPFIND request on a collection to list all members of a        collection along with their DAV:getetag property values, which allows the client to determine which resources were changed, added        or deleted. However, this does not scale well to large collections as the XML response to the PROPFIND request will grow with the        collection size.      </t>      <t>        This specification defines a new WebDAV report that results in the server returning to the client only information about those        resources which have changed, are new or were deleted since a previous execution of the report on the collection.      </t>      <t>        Additionally, a new property is added to collection resources that is used to convey a "synchronization token" that is guaranteed        to change when resources within the collection have changed.      </t>    </section>    <section title='Conventions Used in This Document'>      <t>        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119' />.      </t>      <t>        This document uses XML DTD fragments (<xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20081126"/>, Section 3.2) as a purely notational convention.  WebDAV request and response bodies cannot be validated by a DTD due to the specific extensibility rules defined in Section 17 of [RFC4918] and due to the fact that all XML elements defined by this specification use the XML namespace name "DAV:".  In particular:        <list style='numbers'>            <t>element names use the "DAV:" namespace,</t>            <t>element ordering is irrelevant unless explicitly stated,</t>            <t>extension elements (elements not already defined as valid child elements) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly stated otherwise,</t>            <t>extension attributes (attributes not already defined as valid for this element) may be added anywhere, except when explicitly stated otherwise.</t>        </list>      </t>      <t>        When an XML element type in the "DAV:" namespace is referenced in this document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" will be prefixed to the element type.      </t>      <t>        This document inherits, and sometimes extends, DTD productions from Section 14 of <xref target="RFC4918"/>.      </t>    </section>    <section title='WebDAV Synchronization' anchor='sync-collection'>      <section title='Overview'>        <t>          One way to synchronize data between two entities is to use some form of synchronization token. The token defines          the state of the data being synchronized at a particular point in time. It can then be used to determine what has          changed since one point in time and another.        </t>        <t>          This specification defines a new WebDAV report that is used to enable client-server collection synchronization based on such a token.        </t>        <t>          In order to synchronize the contents of a collection between a server and client, the server provides the client with a synchronization          token each time the synchronization report is executed. That token represents the state of the data being synchronized at that point in time.          The client can then present that same token back to the server at some later time and the server will return only those items that are new,          have changed or were deleted since that token was generated. The server also returns a new token representing the new state at the time the report was run.        </t>        <t>          Typically, the first time a client connects to the server it will need to be informed of the entire state          of the collection (i.e., a full list of all resources that are currently contained in the collection).          That is done by the client sending an empty token value to the server. This indicates to the server that a full listing is required.        </t>        <t>          As an alternative, the client might choose to do its first synchronization using some other mechanism on the collection (e.g. some other          form of batch resource information retrieval such as PROPFIND, SEARCH <xref target="RFC5323"/>, or specialized REPORTs such as those defined in          CalDAV <xref target="RFC4791"/> and CardDAV <xref target="I-D.ietf-vcarddav-carddav"/>) and ask for the DAV:sync-token property to be returned.          This property (defined in <xref target="sync_property" />) contains the same token that can          be used later on to issue a DAV:sync-collection report.        </t>        <t>          In some cases a server might only wish to maintain a limited amount of history about changes to a collection. In that situation          it will return an error to the client when the client presents a token that is "out of date". At that point the client has to fall          back to synchronizing the entire collection by re-running the report request using an empty token value.        </t>      </section>      <section title='DAV:sync-collection Report'>        <t>          If the DAV:sync-collection report is implemented by a WebDAV server, then the server MUST list the report in the "DAV:supported-report-set"          property on any collection supporting synchronization.        </t>        <t>          To implement the behavior for this report a server needs to keep track of changes to any member resources in a collection (as defined in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC4918"/>).          This includes noting the addition of new resources, changes to existing resources and removal of resources.          The server will track each change and provide a synchronization "token" to the client that describes the state of the server          at a specific point in time. This "token" is returned as part of the response to the "sync-collection" report. Clients include          the last token they got from the server in the next "sync-collection" report that they execute and the server provides the changes          from the previous state, represented by the token, to the current state, represented by the new token returned.        </t>        <t>          The synchronization token itself is an "opaque" string - i.e., the actual string data has no specific meaning or syntax. However, the token MUST be a valid URI to allow its use in an If pre-condition request header (see <xref target="if_header"/>).          For example, a simple implementation of such a token could be a numeric counter that counts each change as it occurs and relates that change to the specific object that changed. The numeric value could be appended to a "base" URI to form the valid sync-token.        </t>        <t>          Marshalling:          <list>            <t>              The request URI MUST identify a collection. The request body MUST be a DAV:sync-collection XML element (see              <xref target="sync_collection_element" />), which MUST contain one DAV:sync-token XML element, and one DAV:prop XML element, and MAY contain a DAV:limit XML element.            </t>            <t>                The request MUST include a Depth header with a value of "1" or "infinity".            </t>            <t>              The response body for a successful request MUST be a DAV:multistatus XML element, which MUST contain one DAV:sync-token              element in addition to one DAV:response element for each resource that was created,              has changed or been deleted since the last synchronization operation as specified by the DAV:sync-token provided in the request.              A given resource MUST appear only once in the response.            </t>            <t>              The content of each DAV:response element differs depending on how the resource was altered:              <list>                <t>                  For resources that have changed (i.e., are new or have been modified) the DAV:response MUST contain at least one                  DAV:propstat element and MUST NOT contain any DAV:status element.                </t>                <t>                  For resources that have been removed, the DAV:response MUST contain one DAV:status with a value set to '404 Not Found'                  and MUST NOT contain any DAV:propstat element.                </t>                <t>                  For child collection resources that are unable to support the DAV:sync-collection report, the DAV:response MUST contain one DAV:status with a value set to '405 Method Not Allowed' and MUST NOT contain any DAV:propstat element.                </t>              </list>            </t>            <t>                The conditions under which each type of change can occur is further described in <xref target="change-types" />.            </t>          </list>        </t>        <t>          Preconditions:          <list>            <t>              (DAV:valid-sync-token): The DAV:sync-token element value MUST map to a valid token previously returned by the server.

In such cases the server is REQUIRED to return a DAV:response with status '405 Method Not Allowed' to inform the client that alternative methods have to be used to synchronize the contents of those collections. The 405 response MUST be sent once, when the collection is first reported to the client.          </t>      </section>      <section title="Types of Changes Reported on Initial Synchronization">          <t>              When the DAV:sync-collection request contains an empty DAV:sync-token element, the server MUST return              all members of the collection (taking account of Depth header requirements as per <xref target="depth"/>, and optional truncation of results set as per <xref target="limit"/>) and it MUST NOT return any removed resources. All types of resource (collection or non-collection) MUST be reported.          </t>      </section>      <section title="Types of Changes Reported on Subsequent Synchronizations" anchor='change-types'>          <t>              When the DAV:sync-collection request contains a valid value for the DAV:sync-token element, two types              of resource state changes can be returned (changed or removed).              This section defines what triggers each of these to be returned. It also clarifies the case where a resource              may have undergone multiple changes between two synchronization report requests. In all cases, the Depth header requirements as per <xref target="depth"/>, and optional truncation of results set as per <xref target="limit"/>, are taken into account by the server.          </t>          <section title="Changed Resource">              <t>                A resource MUST be reported as changed if it has been mapped as an member of the target collection since the request sync-token was generated.                This includes resources that have been mapped as the result of a COPY, MOVE or <xref target="RFC5842">BIND</xref> request. All types of resource (collection or non-collection) MUST be reported.              </t>              <t>                In the case where a mapping between a resource and the target collection was removed,                then a new mapping with the same URI created, the new resource MUST be reported as changed                while the old resource MUST NOT be reported as removed.                For example, if a resource was deleted, then recreated using the same URI, it should be reported as a changed resource only.              </t>              <t>                  A resource MUST be reported as changed if its entity tag value                  (defined in Section 3.11 of <xref target="RFC2616"/>) has changed since the request sync-token                  was  generated.              </t>              <t>                  A resource MAY be reported as changed if the user issuing the request was granted access                  to this resource, due to access control changes.              </t>              <t>                  Collection resources MUST be returned as changed if they have an entity tag associated with them and that entity tag changes. There is no guarantee that changes to members of a collection will result in a change in any entity tag of that collection, so clients cannot rely on a series of Depth:1 reports at multiple levels to track all changes within a collection. Instead Depth:infinity has to be used.              </t>          </section>          <section title="Removed Resource">              <t>                  A resource MUST be reported as removed if its mapping under the target collection has been removed                  since the request sync-token was generated, and it has not been re-mapped since it was removed.  This                  includes resources that have been unmapped as the result of a MOVE or <xref target="RFC5842">UNBIND</xref> operation.                  This also includes collection resources that have been removed, including ones that themselves do not support the DAV:sync-collection report.              </t>              <t>                  If a resource was created (and possibly modified), then removed between two synchronization report requests,                  it MUST be reported as removed. This ensures that a client that creates a resource is informed of the removal of the resource, if the removal occurs before the client has had a chance to request a synchronization report.              </t>              <t>                  A resource MAY be reported as removed if the user issuing the request no longer has access to this resource,                  due to access control changes.              </t>              <t>              	For a Depth:infinity report where a collection is removed, the server MUST NOT report the removal of any resources that are members of the removed collection. Clients MUST assume that if a collection is reported as being removed, then all internal members of that collection have also been removed.              </t>          </section>      </section>      <section title="Truncation of Results" anchor="limit">          <t>              A server MAY limit the number of resources in a response, for example, to limit the amount of work expended in processing a request, or as the result of an explicit limit set by the client. If the result set is truncated, the response MUST use status code 207, return a DAV:multistatus response body, and indicate a status of 507 (Insufficient Storage) for the request URI. That DAV:response element SHOULD include a DAV:error element with the DAV:number-of-matches-within-limits precondition, as defined in <xref target="RFC3744"/> (Section 9.2). DAV:response elements for all the changes being reported are also included.          </t>          <t>              When truncation occurs, the DAV:sync-token value returned in the response MUST represent the correct state for the partial set of changes returned. That allows the client to use the returned DAV:sync-token to fetch the next set of changes. In this way the client can effectively "page" through the entire set of changes in a consistent manner.          </t>          <t>              Clients MUST handle the 507 status on the request-URI in the response to the report.          </t>          <t>              For example, consider a server that records changes using a monotonically increasing integer to represent a "revision number" and uses that quantity as the DAV:sync-token value. Assume the last DAV:sync-token used by the client was "10", and since then 15 additional changes have occurred. If the client executes a DAV:sync-collection request with a DAV:sync-token of "10", without a limit the server would return 15 DAV:response elements and a DAV:sync-token with value "25". But if the server choose to limit responses to at most 10 changes, then it would return only 10 DAV:response elements and a DAV:sync-token with value "20", together with an addition DAV:response element for the request-URI with a status code of 507. Subsequently, the client can re-issue the request with the DAV:sync-token value returned from the server and fetch the remaining 5 changes.          </t>      </section>      <section title="Limiting Results" anchor="limits">          <t>              A client can limit the number of results returned by the server through use of the DAV:limit element (<xref target="RFC5323"/>, Section 5.17) in the request body. This is useful when clients have limited space or bandwidth for the results. If a server is unable to truncate the result at or below the requested number, then it MUST fail the request with a DAV:number-of-matches-within-limits post-condition error.

In this case the request fails as another change has occurred to the collection corresponding to the supplied DAV:sync-token.        </t>        <figure>          <preamble>            &gt;&gt; Request &lt;&lt;          </preamble>          <artwork><![CDATA[MKCOL /home/cyrusdaboo/collection/child/ HTTP/1.1Host: webdav.example.comIf: </home/cyrusdaboo/collection/>  (<http://example.com/ns/sync/12346>)]]>          </artwork>        </figure>        <figure>          <preamble>            &gt;&gt; Response &lt;&lt;          </preamble>          <artwork><![CDATA[HTTP/1.1 412 Pre-condition Failed]]>          </artwork>        </figure>      </section>    </section>    <section title="XML Element Definitions">      <section title="DAV:sync-collection XML Element" anchor="sync_collection_element">        <t>          <list style="hanging">            <t hangText="Name:">              sync-collection            </t>            <t hangText="Namespace:">              DAV:            </t>            <t hangText="Purpose:">              WebDAV report used to synchronize data between client and server.            </t>            <t hangText="Description:">              See <xref target="sync-collection" />.            </t>          </list>        </t>        <figure>          <artwork><![CDATA[<!ELEMENT sync-collection (sync-token, DAV:limit?, DAV:prop)><!-- DAV:limit defined in RFC 5323, Section 5.17 --><!-- DAV:prop defined in RFC 4918, Section 14.18 -->]]>          </artwork>        </figure>      </section>      <section title="DAV:sync-token XML Element" anchor="sync_token_element">          <t>            <list style="hanging">              <t hangText="Name:">                sync-token              </t>              <t hangText="Namespace:">                DAV:              </t>              <t hangText="Purpose:">                The synchronization token provided by the server and returned by the client.              </t>              <t hangText="Description:">                See <xref target="sync-collection" />.              </t>            </list>          </t>          <figure>            <artwork><![CDATA[<!ELEMENT sync-token CDATA>]]>            </artwork>          </figure>      </section>      <section title="DAV:multistatus XML Element" anchor="multistatus_element">          <t>            <list style="hanging">              <t hangText="Name:">                multistatus              </t>              <t hangText="Namespace:">                DAV:              </t>              <t hangText="Purpose:">                Extends the DAV:multistatus element to include synchronization details.              </t>              <t hangText="Description:">                See <xref target="sync-collection" />.              </t>            </list>          </t>          <figure>            <artwork><![CDATA[<!ELEMENT multistatus (DAV:response*, DAV:responsedescription?,                       sync-token?) ><!-- DAV:multistatus originally defined in RFC 4918, Section 14.16     but overridden here to add the DAV:sync-token element --><!-- DAV:response defined in RFC 4918, Section 14.24 --><!-- DAV:responsedescription defined in RFC 4918, Section 14.25 -->]]>            </artwork>          </figure>      </section>    </section>    <section title='Security Considerations'>      <t>        This extension does not introduce any new security concerns than those already described in HTTP and WebDAV.      </t>    </section>    <section title='IANA Considerations'>      <t>        This document does not require any actions on the part of IANA.      </t>    </section>    <section title='Acknowledgments'>      <t>        The following individuals contributed their ideas and support for writing this specification: Bernard Desruisseaux, Mike Douglass,        Ciny Joy, Andrew McMillan, Julian Reschke, and Wilfredo Sanchez.
