               SCSV for TLS Client Credential Protection
               draft-badra-tls-identity-protection-00.txt

Abstract

   This document defines a special Signaling Cipher Suite Value (SCSV)
   "TLS_IDENTITY_PROTECTION_SCSV", with code point {XxXX, XxXX}.  This
   SCSV is not a true cipher suite (it does not correspond to any valid
   set of algorithms) and cannot be negotiated.  By negotiating this
   ciphersuite, the TLS clients will be able to determine for themselves
   when, how, to what extent and for what purpose information about them
   is communicated to others.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a special Signaling Cipher Suite Value (SCSV)
   "TLS_IDENTITY_PROTECTION_SCSV", with code point {XxXX, XxXX}.  This
   SCSV is not a true cipher suite (it does not correspond to any valid
   set of algorithms) and cannot be negotiated.  By negotiating this
   ciphersuite, the TLS clients will be able to determine for themselves
   when, how, to what extent and for what purpose information about them
   is communicated to others.

   When a ClientHello is received, the server MUST check if it includes
   the TLS_IDENTITY_PROTECTION_SCSV.  If it does, continue the handshake
   with the client.

   When a ClientHello is received, the client MUST the ChangeCipherSpec
   message before the Certificate and the CertificateVerify messages and
   after the ClientKeyExchange message.  The ChangeCipherSpec message is
   sent to notify the receiving party that subsequent messages will be
   protected under the cipher suite and keys negotiated during the TLS
   Handshake.

   The idea of ensuring the TLS client credential protection is not new
   and had been proposed to the TLS mailing list in August 2000 by F.
   Corolla.  The initial idea consists of changing the order of the
   messages that the client sends after receiving ServerHelloDone, in
   the same order defined here.  However, during 2000, the only way to
   include that to TLS is by defining a new TLS version.
