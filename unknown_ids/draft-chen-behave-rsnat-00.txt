Abstract

   For the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 address pool against the slow
   development of IPv6, IPv4/6 coexistence/transition proved to be a
   long period.  In the IPv4/6 transition process, there are many NAT-
   like technologies existing in the internet.  However the NAT boxes
   such as IPv4 NAT, IPv4/6 NAT are so poor in their reliability and
   scalability, which put a severe threat on the development of IPv4/6
   Transition.  This document defines a reliable and scalable NAT(RS-
   NAT)mechanism to solve the problem.

1.  Introduction

   For the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 address pool against the slow
   development of IPv6, IPv4/6 coexistence/transition proved to be a
   long period.  In the IPv4/6 transition process there are obviously
   two trends: one is the supporter of IPv6, who proposed many
   transition mechanisms such as NAT-PT , NAT64.  The other is reluctant
   to use IPv6 because of the high cost of upgrade they network and some
   applications and want to use NAT444, DS-Lite to delay the exhaustion
   of IPv4.  No matter which side will win the future, the NAT-like
   function is a key point in the coexistence/transition period.

   However much of the NAT-like functions are stateful, which maintain
   the state of address mapping for network translation or ALG function.
   The stateful boxes in the network exert high threat on reliability
   and scalability when the network becomes huge.  For example the box
   will be single point of failure in the large scaled Network.
   Although some advices are proposed such as mentioned in NAT64 using
   multi-box, the static configuration and localized mapping information
   in each box are not able to accommodate the dynamic internet
   environment.

   In this document, we proposed a reliable and scalable NAT mechanism
   to overcome the stateful NAT problem mentioned above, which include
   IPv4 NAT and IPv4/6 NAT.  Note that the stateless NAT mechanism
   IVI[I-D.baker-behave-ivi], and its limitation is out the scope of
   this document.

2.  RS-NAT Overview

   In the topology shown in figure 1, there are two main parts of
   network: the User Network and Service Network.  User Network is the
   realm where the users initiate the communication with servers.  The
   Service Network is the realm where the public service server located.
   In addition there are some RS-NAT boxes which act as bridges between
   the networks.

   Figure 1: General Topology of RS-NAT framework

   The User Network and Service Network can be IPv4,IPv6 or Dual-stacks.
   As a result there are several communication scenarios learned from
   the general topology using the general form IPvx-IPvy, which means
   users with IPvx protocol initiate connections to servers with IPvy
   protocol.  These communication scenarios are (private)IPv4-IPv4,
   IPv4-IPv6, IPv6-IPv4, and IPv6-IPv6.  VRRP[RFC3768] is perfect for
   IPv4-IPv4 scenarios and there is no need to use NAT for IPv6-IPv6.
   So in this document we mainly focus on IPv4-IPv6/IPv6-IPv4 scenarios.

   The User Network and Service Network are logical concepts, which may
   be composed of many small networks in one AS or several Ases.  For
   example the User Network shown in Figure 1 may consist of several
   IPv4 metropolitan area networks in one network provider.The Service
   Network may be composed of IPv6 islands connected directly, through
   tunnels or IPv6 transit-core such as CNGI-CERNET2 in China.  The
   metropolitan area networks in User Network may connect to Service
   Network individually through RS-NAT boxes which may be located at
   different cities.  Obviously these sub-networks is multi-homed at
   least with two access links.  Although the problem of multi-homing is
   beyond the scope of this document, it is worth explaining the detail
   of the topology.

   Note that the definition of User Network and Service Network are
   defined according to one communication.  They are not strict because
   an end user can regarded as both initiator and server from different
   views.

3.  RS-NAT Box

   The following sections will discuss the requirement of RS-NAT Box and
   its basic functions.

   In order to achieve the role of bridge between the two networks in
   the scenarios, which are depicted in sections 3, the RS-NAT box
   should have three basic functions: the support of IPv4/6 dual-stack,
   router and IPv4/6 address translator.

   In the IPv6-IPv4 scenario RS-NAT router advertise the prefix64
   [I-D.miyata-behave-prefix64] routing information to User Network, and
   advertise the prefix info of static IPv4 address pool to Service
   Network.  In this scenario DNS64 [I-D.bagnulo-behave-dns64] is
   employed to dispatch the prefix64 for each DNS request, which will be
   discussed in section 5.  In the IPv4-IPv6 scenario RS-NAT router
   advertise its own IPv6 prefix routing information to Service Network,
   and send the prefix info of static IPv4 address pool to User Network.
   In this scenario DNS ALG mentioned in NAT-PT will be modified to
   support the separation of the data plane and control plane, which
   will be discussed in section 5.

   As an IP protocol translator the mapping mechanism in RS-NAT is also
   an important part.  The address mapping information is useful not
   only for the IP head translation, but essential for some application
   that embed network-layer addresses as well, such as FTP, SIP etc.

4.  Load Balancing Mechanisms

   Sections 3 and 4 have already depicted the framework of RS-NAT and
   the key role: RS-NAT box.  This section will show how the RS-NAT run
   and balance the traffic among these RS-NAT boxes.

4.1.  IPv6-IPv4 scenario

   Figure 2 illustrates the connection setup in IPv6-IPv4 scenario.  The
   connection setup follows two steps:

   1) User sends DNS query to DNS64 and get the DNS reply with a IPv4-
   embeded IPv6 addresses in the form of Prefix64::IPv4 adress;

   2) User sends the packet to the IPv4-embeded IPv6 addresses.  The
   different IPv6 prefix will lead the packet to different RS-NAT
   routers, which is achieved by the RS-NAT routing function.

                        +------+

                    The Data Plane

   Figure 2: IPv6-IPv4 Connection Setup

   As mentioned previously RS-NAT routers run BGP and keep BGP neighbor
   information with each other.  Each RS-NAT router will maintain the
   IPv6 prefix pool just as DNS64 does and they will use a Prefix-
   Assignment Algorithm to decide individually which part of prefix64
   they are in charge of.  The Prefix-Assignment Algorism follows the
   simple idea that all RS-NAT routers share the prefix almost evenly
   based on the BGP neighbor information.

   For example there is 2^8 2001::/24 in prefix64 pool 2001::/16 and
   there are 2 RS-NAT routers which are sorted according to the size of
   IP address.  The Assignment plan is that prefixes form 2001:0000::/24
   to 2001:7f00::/24 will be assigned to the router with larger IP
   address, and the prefixes from 2001:8000::/24 to 2001:ff00::/24 is in

   the charge of the other router.  If there are more RS-NAT routers,
   these prefixes can also easy assigned to them.

   In order to balance the traffic among these RS-NAT routers, each
   router should advertise the route of its converged prefix64 to User
   Network.  Note that for the Redundancy consideration each router can
   advertise the routes of other part of prefix64 with higher cost or
   larger granularity in order that when other RS-NAT routers fail for
   some reason, the alive can work immediately.

   Note that once RS-NAT routers are failed or new RS-NAT routers are
   configured to join in, the routing for load balance can be
   automatically configured by RS-NAT routers by themselves.  Prefix-
   Assignment Algorithm will be triggered in each RS-NAT router to
   recompute the router prefix.  BGP KEEPALVE and OPEN messages are used
   to achieve that trigger which will be explored in the next version of
   this document .

4.2.  IPv4-IPv6 scenario

   The load balancing mechanism in IPv4-IPv6 is similar to the one in
   IPv6-IPv4 in that the IPv4 address pool should shared by RS-NAT
   routers and each RS-NAT router is responsible to advertise the route
   of their IPv4 address pool, which is similar to the routing procedure
   of RS-NAT routers in IPv6-IPv4.  The IPv4-IPv6 Connection Setup is
   shown in figure 3.

   The differences between the two scenarios are in two fold:

   o  The control plane: In IPv6-IPv4 it is the DNS64 that synchronize
      the IPv6 and IPv4 address for IPv4 hosts, while in IPv4-IPv6 a DNS
      ALG server monitors the DNS request and reply forming the mapping
      of IPv4/6 address.

   o  Address mapping advertisement: For the load balancing reason,DNS
      ALG server is not designed for traffic translation and forwarding,
      which part is separated to RS-NAT routers.  As a result the DNS
      ALG server should send the mapping info to RS-NAT routers using
      new BGP attribute which will be defined in section 6.

   Note that if the scenario is the mixture of the two, RS-NAT can work
   well with proper address configuration.

5.  Redundancy Mechanisms

   If there exits multi boxes between the two edge of network, problems
   will arise when some boxes are not stable or failed.  The problems
   are mainly in two aspects.  The first problem is in routing aspect:
   when one box fails, there is no other valid routes to the
   destination.  The second is in address mapping aspect: when one box
   fails, the address mapping information in the box is lost causing the
   flows breaking up and reconnection.

   The first problem is solved in section 4 in that the routing
   mechanism makes sure that the taffic will find a way out through
   another RS-NAT router by setting the different route cost or
   preference.  In this section we will define a BGP attribute that one
   RS-NAT can advertise the local address mapping to other neighbors
   which guarantees the redundancy of mapping info.  With that
   redundancy address mapping information RS-NAT routers are able to
   translate the new traffic

5.1.  Address mapping Attribute

   Address mapping attribute is an optional transitive attribute that is
   composed of a set of TLVs.  The type code of the attribute is to be
   assigned by IANA.  Each TLV contains information corresponding to a
   particular tunnel technology.  The TLV is structured as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |    mapping Type (2 Octets)    |        Length (2 Octets)      |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      |                             Value                             |
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   apping Type (2 octets): It identifies the type of the mapping
   information being transmitted.  This document defines the following
   types:

   - IPv4-IPv4: mapping Type = 1

   - IPv4-IPv6/IPv6-IPv4: mapping Type = 2

   - IPv6-IPv6: mapping Type=3

   Unknown types are to be ignored and skipped upon receipt.

   Length (2 octets): the total number of octets of the Value field.

   Value (variable): The value is composed of the address mapping
   information.  If mapping type is 2, the value contains an IPv4/6
   address mapping just simply structured as follows:

           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
           |    IPv4 address (4 Octets)    |
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
           |                               |
           |    IPv6 address (16 Octets)   |
           |                               |
           |                               |
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

5.2.  Performance consideration

   As the mapping information is tremendous and dynamic.  The
   performance of RS-NAT is an important issue.  BGP reflector can be
   utilized to reduce the BGP update massage.  If reflector is deployed,
   new mechanism should guarantee each RS-NAT routers knowing the number
   of routers.In addition some optimization of RS-NAT and possible
   modifications of BGP will be explored in the next version of this
   document.

   Note that RS-NAT routers are located on the edge of network and they
   may not connect directly.  BGP has its nature advantage to do
   signaling among edge routers over some intra-domain protocol.
