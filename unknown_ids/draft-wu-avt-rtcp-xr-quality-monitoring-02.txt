Internet-Draft     RTCP XR Video Quality Report Blocks    September 2010


1.  Introduction

   Along with the wide deployment of broadband access and the
   development of new IPTV services (e.g., broadcast video, video on
   demand), there is increasing interest in monitoring and managing
   networks and applications that deliver real-time applications over
   IP, to ensure that all end users obtain acceptable video/audio
   quality.  The main drives come from operators, since offering
   performance monitoring capability can help diagnose network
   impairments, facilitate in root cause analysis and aid in verifying
   compliance with service level agreements (SLAs) between Internet
   Service Providers (ISPs) and content providers.

   The factors that affect real-time application quality can be split
   into two categories.  The first category consists of transport-
   dependent factors such as packet loss, delay and jitter (which also
   translates into losses in the playback buffer).  The factors in the
   second category are application-specific factors that affect video
   quality and are sensitivity to network errors.  These factors can be
   but not limited to video codec and loss recovery technique, coding
   bit rate, packetization scheme, and content characteristics.

   Compared with application-specific factors, the transport-dependent
   factors sometimes are not sufficient to measure video quality, since
   the ability to analyze the video in the application layer provides
   quantifiable measurements for subscriber Quality of Experience (QoE)
   that may not be captured in the transmission layers or from the RTP
   layer down.  In a typical scenario, monitoring of the transmission
   layers can produce statistics suggesting that quality is not an
   issue, such as the fact that network jitter is not excessive.
   However, problems may occur in the service layers leading to poor
   subscriber QoE.  Therefore monitoring using only network-level
   measurements may be insufficient when application layer video quality
   is required.

   In order to provide accurate measures of video quality for operators
   when transporting video across a network, the video quality Metrics
   is highly required which can be conveyed in the RTCP XR
   packets[RFC3611] and may have the following three benefits:

      *  Tuning the video encoder algorithm to satisfy video quality
         requirements
      *  Determining which system techniques to use in a given situation
         and when to switch from one technique to another as system
         parameters change
      *  Verifying the continued correct operation of an existing system

   RFC 3611 [RFC3611] defines seven report block formats for network

   management and quality monitoring.  However, there are no block types
   specifically designed for conveying video quality metrics.  This
   document focuses on specifying new report block types used to convey
   video-specific quality metrics.

   The report block types defined in this document fall into two
   categories.  The first category consists of general information
   regarding transmission quality, to be generated and processed by the
   RTP transport.  The report blocks in the second category convey
   metrics above transport that affect video quality and are sensitivity
   to network errors.

   Nine report block formats are defined by this document.  Of these,
   three are transport layer metrics:

      *  RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block
      *  Audio-Video Playout Offset Report Block
      *  Layered Streams Statistics Metrics Block

   The other six are application layer metrics:

      *  Video Statistics Summary Report Block
      *  TR 101 290 Decodability Metrics Block [ETSI]
      *  Video Stream Loss and Discard Metrics Block
      *  Video Stream Burst Metrics Block
      *  Synthetical Multimedia Quality Metrics Block
      *  RTP Terminal Configuration Metrics Block

3.  Applicability

   All the report blocks defined in this document could be used by
   dedicated network monitoring applications.  As specified in RFC 3611
   [RFC3611], for such an application it might be appropriate to allow
   more than 5% of RTP data bandwidth to be used for RTCP packets, thus
   allowing proportionately larger and more detailed report blocks.

   The Audio-Video Synchronization Report Block Section 4.2 has been
   defined for video conferencing applications.  Such applications can
   use this report block to monitor A/V component synchronization to
   ensure satisfactory QoE.  Tighter tolerances than typically used have
   been recommended for such applications.

   The Flows Synchronization Delay Report Block has been defined
   primarily for layered or multi-description video coding applications.
   When joining a layered video session in such an application, a
   receiver may not synchronize playout across the multimedia session
   until RTCP SR packets have been received on all of the component RTP
   sessions.  This report block can be used to ensure synchronization
   between different media layers for the same multimedia session.

   The Video Stream Loss and Discard Metrics Report Block, Video Stream
   Burst Metrics report Block, Video Statistics Summary Report Block and
   Layered Video Statistics Metrics Block can be applied to any real
   time video application, while the TR 101 290 Decodability Metrics
   Report Block and Synthetical Multimedia Quality Metrics Report Block
   can be used in any real-time AV application [ETSI].


4.  Transport Layer Metrics

4.1.  RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block

   This block reports the initial synchronization delay between RTP
   sessions of the same media stream sent using Multi-Session
   Transmission [I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-svc] or the initial synchronization
   delay betwen RTP session of the different media types
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-rtp-sync], which is beyond the information
   carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  Information is recorded
   about session bandwidth and synchronization delay.

   The RTP Flows Intial Synchronization Delay Report Block has the
   following format:

5.3.  Video Stream Loss and Discard Metrics Block

   This block reports Loss and Discard metrics statistics beyond the
   information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  The block
   reports separately on packets lost on the IP channel, and those that
   have been received but then discarded by the receiving jitter buffer.

   It is very useful to distinguish between packets lost by the network
   and those discarded due to jitter.  Both have equal effect on the
   quality of the video stream, however, having separate counts helps
   identify the source of quality degradation.  These fields MUST be
   populated, and MUST be set to zero if no packets have been received.

   Implementations MUST provide values for all the fields defined here.
   For certain metrics, if the value is undefined or unknown, then the
   specified default or unknown field value MUST be provided.

   Loss rate: 8 bits
      The fraction of RTP data packets from the source lost since the
      beginning of reception, expressed as a fixed point number with the
      binary point at the left edge of the field.  This value is
      calculated by dividing the total number of lost packets containing
      specified frame (e.g., I frame) (after the effects of applying any
      error protection such as FEC) by the total number of packets
      expected, multiplying the result of the division by 256, limiting
      the maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and taking the
      integer part.  The numbers of duplicated packets and discarded
      packets do not enter into this calculation.  Since receivers
      cannot be required to maintain unlimited buffers, a receiver MAY

      categorize late-arriving packets as lost.  The degree of lateness
      that triggers a loss SHOULD be significantly greater than that
      which triggers a discard.

   Discard rate: 8 bits
      The fraction of RTP data packets from the source that have been
      discarded since the beginning of reception, due to late or early
      arrival, under-run or overflow at the receiving jitter buffer.
      This value is expressed as a fixed point number with the binary
      point at the left edge of the field.  It is calculated by dividing
      the total number of discarded packets containing specified frame
      (e.g., I-Frame) (excluding duplicate packet discards) by the total
      number of packets expected, multiplying the result of the division
      by 256, limiting the maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and
      taking the integer part.


5.4.  Video Stream Burst Metrics Block

   This block reports Burst metrics statistics beyond the information
   carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  It reports on the
   combined effect of losses and discards, as both have equal effect on
   video quality.

   In order to properly assess the quality of a video stream, it is
   desirable to consider the degree of burstiness of packet loss RFC
   3357 [RFC3357].  Following the one-way loss pattern sample metrics
   discussed in [RFC3357], a measure of the spacing between consecutive
   network packet loss or error events, is a "loss distance".  The loss
   distance metric captures the spacing between the loss periods.  The
   duration of a loss or error event (e.g. and how many packets are lost
   in that duration) is a "loss period", the loss period metric captures
   the frequency and length (burstiness) of loss once it starts.  Delay
   reports include the transit delay between RTP end points and the end
   system processing delays, both of which contribute to the user
   perceived delay.

   Implementations MUST provide values for all the fields defined here.
   For certain metrics, if the value is undefined or unknown, then the
   specified default or unknown field value MUST be provided.

   The block is encoded as six 32-bit words:

   Loss Distance: 16 bits
      The mean duration, expressed in milliseconds, of the loss
      intervals that have occurred since the beginning of reception
      [DSLF].  The duration of each loss distance is calculated based
      upon the frames that mark the beginning and end of that period.
      It is equal to the timestamp of the end frame, plus the duration
      of the end frame, minus the timestamp of the beginning frame.  If

      frame that marks the end of the prior burst loss and the frame
      that marks the beginning of the subsequent burst loss.  It is
      equal to the timestamp of the subsequent burst frame, minus the
      timestamp of the prior burst packet, plus the duration of the

      estimated values MUST be used.  In the case of a gap that occurs
      at the beginning of reception, the sum of the timestamp of the
      prior burst packet and the duration of the prior burst packet are
      replaced by the reception start time.  In the case of a gap that
      occurs at the end of reception, the timestamp of the subsequent

   MOS-V: 16 bits
      The estimated mean opinion score for video quality (MOS-V) is a
      video quality metric on a scale from 1 to 5, in which 5 represents
      excellent and 1 represents unacceptable [G.1082][P.NAMS].  This
      metric is defined as not including the effects of audio
      impairments and can be compared to MOS scores obtained from video
      quality tests.  It is expressed as an integer in the range 10 to
      50, corresponding to MOS x 10.  For example, a value of 35 would
      correspond to an estimated MOS score of 3.5.

      A value of 127 indicates that this parameter is unavailable.
      Values other than 127 and the valid range defined above MUST NOT
      be sent and MUST be ignored by the receiving system.

   MOS-A: 16 bits
      The estimated mean opinion score for Audio quality (MOS-A) is
      defined as including the effects of delay and other effects that
      would affect Audio-Video quality [RFC3611].  It is expressed as an
      integer in the range 10 to 50, corresponding to MOS x 10, as for
      MOS-A.

      A value of 127 indicates that this parameter is unavailable.
      Values other than 127 and the valid range defined above MUST not
      be sent and MUST be ignored by the receiving system.

   MOS-AV: 16 bits

      The estimated mean opinion score for Audio-Video quality (MOS-AV)
      is defined as including the effects of delay and other effects
      that would affect Audio-Video quality [G.1082][P.NAMS].  It is
      expressed as an integer in the range 10 to 50, corresponding to
      MOS x 10, as for MOS-AV.  A value of 127 indicates that this
      parameter is unavailable.  Values other than 127 and the valid

   block type (BT): 8 bits
      A Video Stream Metrics Report Block is identified by the constant
      <RTCM>.

   reserved: 8 bits
      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   SSRC of source: 32 bits
      The SSRC of the RTP data packet source being reported upon by this
      report block. in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   Rsd.: 6 bits
      All bits SHALL be set to 0 by the sender and SHALL be ignored on
      reception.

   Reserved: 16 bits
      All bits SHALL be set to 0 by the sender and SHALL be ignored on
      reception.

   Packet loss concealment (PLC): 2 bits
      Standard (11) / enhanced (10) / disabled (01) / unspecified (00)
      .As described in [RFC3611].When PLC = 11, then a simple replay or
      interpolation algorithm is being used to fill-in the missing
      packet; this approach is typically able to conceal isolated lost
      packets at low packet loss rates.  When PLC = 10, then an enhanced
      interpolation algorithm is being used; algorithms of this type are
      able to conceal high packet loss rates effectively.  When PLC =
      01, then silence is being inserted in place of lost packets.  When
      PLC = 00, then no information is available concerning the use of
      PLC; however, for some codecs this may be inferred.

   Jitter buffer adaptive (JBA): 2 bits
      Adaptive (11) / non-adaptive (10) / reserved (01)/ unknown (00).
      As described in [RFC3611], when the jitter buffer is adaptive,
      then its size is being dynamically adjusted to deal with varying
      levels of jitter.  When non-adaptive, the jitter buffer size is
      maintained at a fixed level.  When either adaptive or non-
      adaptive modes are specified, then the jitter buffer size
      parameters below MUST be specified.

   Jitter buffer rate (JB rate): 4 bits
      As described in [RFC3611]J = adjustment rate (0-15), This
      represents the implementation specific adjustment rate of a jitter
      buffer in adaptive mode.  This parameter is defined in terms of
      the approximate time taken to fully adjust to a step change in
      peak to peak jitter from 30 ms to 100 ms such that: adjustment
      time = 2 * J * frame size (ms)
