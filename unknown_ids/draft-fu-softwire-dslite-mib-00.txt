1. Introduction

   Dual-Stack Lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] is a solution to
   offer both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity to customers crossing IPv6 only
   infrastructure. One of its key components is an IPv4-over-IPv6 
   tunnel, which is used to provide IPv4 connection across service 
   provider IPv6 network. Another key component is a carrier-grade 
   IPv4-IPv4 NAT to share service provider IPv4 addresses among 
   customers.

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community. This MIB module may be used for configuration and
   monitoring the devices in the Dual-Stack Lite scenario.

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the MIB. MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
   [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580].

3. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4. Difference from the IP tunnel MIB and NAT MIB

   The key technologies for DS-Lite are IP in IP (IPv4-in-IPv6) tunnel
   and NAT (IPv4 to IPv4 translation).

   The NAT-MIB [RFC4008] is designed to carry translation from any
   address family to any address family, therefore supports IPv4 to IPv4
   translation.

   The tunnel MIB [RFC4087] is designed for managing tunnels of any type
   over IPv4 and IPv6 networks, therefore supports IP in IP tunnels.

   However, NAT MIB and tunnel MIB together are not sufficient to
   support DS-Lite. This document describes the specific MIB
   requirements for DS-Lite, as below.

         In DS-Lite scenario, the tunnel type is IP in IP, more
         precisely, is IPv4 in IPv6.  Therefore, it is unnecessary to
         describe tunnel type in DS-Lite MIB.

         In DS-Lite scenario, the translation type is IPv4 private
         address to IPv4 public address. Therefore, it is unnecessary to
         describe the type of address in the corresponding
         tunnelIfLocalInetAddress and tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress objects
         in DS-Lite MIB.

         In DS-lite scenario, the AFTR is not only the tunnel end
         concentrator, but also a 4-4 translator. Within the AFTR,
         tunnel information and translation information MUST be mapped
         each other. Two independent MIB is not able to reflect this
         mapping relationship. Therefore, a combined MIB is necessary.

5. Structure of the MIB Module

   The DS-Lite MIB provides a way to configure and manage the devices in
   DS-Lite scenario through SNMP.

   DS-Lite MIB is configurable on a per-interface basis. It depends on
   several parts of the IF-MIB [RFC2863], tunnel MIB [RFC4087], and NAT
   MIB [RFC4008].

     5.1. The DSliteMIBTunnel Subtree

   The DSliteMIBTunnel subtree describes managed objects used for
   managing tunnels in the DS-Lite scenario. Because the tunnel MIB
   supports the tunnel management function in DS-Lite, we may reuse it
   in DS-Lite MIB.

     5.2. The DSliteMIBNAT Subtree

   The DSliteMIBNAT Subtree describes managed objects used for
   configuration as well as monitoring of AFTR which is capable of NAT
   function. Because the NAT MIB supports the NAT management function in
   DS-Lite, we MAY reuse it in DS-Lite MIB.

     5.3. The DSliteMIBRelationInfo Subtree

   The DSliteMIBRelationInfo Subtree provides the information of mapping
   relationship between the tunnel MIB and NAT MIB. It is vital

Internet-Draft   draft-fu-softwire-dslite-mib-00.txt          May 2011


   information for DS-Lite implementer. It also includes information
   about traffic statistics.

     5.4. The DSliteMIBConformance Subtree

   The Subtree provides conformance information of MIB objects.

6. MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   This MIB module IMPORTs objects from [RFC4087], [RFC4008], [RFC2580],
   [RFC2578], [RFC2863], [RFC4001],[RFC3411].

   Notes: The IF-MIB defines the MTU for the interface which includes
   the virtual interface of the tunnel, so DS-Lite MIB does not need to
   define the MTU for tunnel.

8. IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

      Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
      ----------        -----------------------
      DSLite-MIB         { transmission XXX }

9. Security Considerations

   The DS-Lite MIB module can be used for configuration of certain
   objects, and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly
   configured, with potentially disastrous results. Because this MIB
   module reuse the IP tunnel MIB and nat MIB, the security
   considerations for these MIBs are also applicable to the DS-Lite
   MIB.

   Unauthorized read access to tunnelIfLocalAddress, or any object in
   the DSLiteMIBBindRelationTable or DSLiteMIBPortBindRelationTable
   would reveal information about the mapping information.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
