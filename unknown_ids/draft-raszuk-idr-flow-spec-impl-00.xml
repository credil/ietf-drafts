    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Dissemination of flow specification rules BGP describes an extension
      to BGP which may be used to propagate information describing flows of
      data between BGP speakers. Such information may be needed to apply
      action on selected data flows through and beyond autonoumus systems.
      Examples of such actions are: dropping, rate limiting, redirecting,
      monitoring etc ...</t>
