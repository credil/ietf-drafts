    <abstract>
      <t>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
      quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain.
      The overall rate of the PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the
      PCN-domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain
      configured rates are exceeded. The level of marking allows the boundary
      nodes to make decisions about whether to admit or block a new flow
      request, and (in abnormal circumstances) whether to terminate some of
      the existing flows, thereby protecting the QoS of previously admitted
      flows. This document specifies how such marks are to be encoded into the
      IP header by re-using the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
      codepoints within this controlled domain. This encoding builds on the
      baseline encoding and provides for three PCN encoding states:
      Not-marked, Threshold-marked and Excess-traffic-marked.</t>

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) <xref
      target="RFC5559"></xref> is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of
      inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain, in a simple, scalable, and
      robust fashion. Two mechanisms are used: admission control, to decide
      whether to admit or block a new flow request, and (in abnormal
      circumstances) flow termination to decide whether to terminate some of
      the existing flows. To achieve this, the overall rate of PCN-traffic is
      metered on every link in the domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately
      marked when certain configured rates are exceeded. These configured
      rates are below the rate of the link thus providing notification to
      boundary nodes about overloads before any congestion occurs (hence
      "pre-congestion notification").</t>

      <t>The level of marking allows boundary nodes to make decisions about
      whether to admit or terminate. This is achieved by marking packets on
      interior nodes according to some metering function implemented at each
      node. Excess-traffic-marking marks PCN packets that exceed a certain
      reference rate on a link while threshold marking marks all PCN packets
      on a link when the PCN traffic rate exceeds a higher reference rate
      <xref target="RFC5670"></xref>. These marks are monitored by the egress
      nodes of the PCN domain.</t>

      <t>To fully support these two types of marking, three encoding states
      are needed. The baseline encoding described in <xref
      target="RFC5696"></xref> provides for deployment scenarios that only
      require two PCN encoding states using a single Diffserv codepoint. This
      document describes an experimental extension to the baseline-encoding
      that adds a third PCN encoding state in the IP header, still using a
      single Diffserv codepoint. For brevity it will be called the 3-in-1 PCN
      Encoding.</t>

      <t>General PCN-related terminology is defined in the PCN architecture
      <xref target="RFC5559"></xref>, and terminology specific to packet
      encoding is defined in the PCN baseline encoding <xref
      target="RFC5696"></xref>. Note that <xref target="RFC5696"></xref>
      requires the PCN Working Group to maintain a list of all DSCPs used for
      PCN experiments.</t>

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_Requirement"
             title="The Requirement for Three PCN Encoding States">
      <t>The PCN architecture <xref target="RFC5559"></xref> describes
      proposed PCN schemes that expect traffic to be metered and marked using
      both Threshold and Excess Traffic schemes. In order to achieve this it
      is necessary to allow for three PCN encoding states: one as a Not Marked
      (NM) state and the other two to distinguish these two levels of marking
      severity <xref target="RFC5670"></xref>. The way tunnels processed the
      ECN field before <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel"></xref>
      severely limited how to encode these states.</t>

      <t>The two bit ECN field seems to offer four possible encoding states,
      but one (00) is set aside for traffic controlled by transports that do
      not understand PCN marking <xref target="RFC5696"></xref>, so it would
      be irregular and risky to use it as a PCN encoding state. Of the three
      remaining ECN codepoints, only one (11) can be introduced by a congested
      node within a tunnel and still survive the decapsulation behaviour of a
      tunnel egress not updated to comply with <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel"></xref>. The two remaining codepoints
      are (10) and (01). But if a node within the tunnel used either of these
      two remaining codepoints to try to mark packets with a second severity
      level, a tunnel not updated to comply with <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel"></xref> would remove this marking on
      decapsulation. The ECN field was constrained to two marking states in
      this way irrespective of which earlier ECN tunnelling specification the
      tunnel complied with, whether regular IP in IP tunnelling <xref
      target="RFC3168"></xref> or IPsec tunnelling <xref
      target="RFC4301"></xref>.</t>

      <t>One way to provide another encoding state that survives tunnelling is
      to use a second Diffserv codepoint <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pcn-3-state-encoding"></xref>. Instead, to avoid
      wasting scarce Diffserv codepoints, a network operator can require
      tunnels in a PCN region to comply with <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel"></xref>, thus removing the
      constraints imposed by earlier tunnelling specifications.</t>

      <t>Therefore this document presupposes tunnels in the PCN region comply
      with the newly proposed decapsulation rules defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-tunnel"></xref>. Then the constraints of
      standard tunnels no longer apply so this document can define a 3-state
      encoding for PCN within one Diffserv codepoint.</t>

    <section anchor="pcn3in1_Encoding" title="The 3-in-1 PCN Encoding">
      <t>The 3-in-1 PCN Encoding scheme is based closely on the baseline
      encoding defined in <xref target="RFC5696"></xref> so that there will be
      no compatibility issues if a PCN-domain evolves from using the baseline
      encoding scheme to the experimental scheme described here. The exact
      manner in which the PCN encoding states are carried in the IP header is
      shown in <xref target="pcn3in1_Fig_Encoding"></xref>.</t>

      which is any PCN-Compatible DiffServ codepoint as defined in Section 4.2
      of the PCN baseline encoding <xref target="RFC5696"></xref>). The PCN
      codepoint of a packet defines its marking state as follows:<list

          <t hangText="Not-PCN:">The packet is controlled by a transport that

      <t>Packets marked NM, ThM or ETM are termed PCN-packets. Their entry

          <t>It MUST change NM TO ThM if the threshold-meter function
