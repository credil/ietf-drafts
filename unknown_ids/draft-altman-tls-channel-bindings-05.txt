2.  Introduction

   Subsequent to the publication of "On Channel Bindings" [RFC5246],
   three channel binding types for Transport Layer Security (TLS) were
   proposed, reviewed and added to the IANA channel binding type
   registry, all in accordance with [RFC5246].  Those channel binding
   types are: 'tls-unique', 'tls-server-end-point', and 'tls-unique-for-
   telnet'.  It has become desirable to have these channel binding types
   re-registered through an RFC so as to make it easier to reference
   them.  This document does just that.  The authors of those three
   channel binding types have, or have indicated that they will,
   transferred "ownership" of those channel binding types to the IESG.

   We also provide some advice on the applicability of these channel
   binding types, as well as advice on when to use which.  And we
   provide an abstract API that TLS implementors should provide, by
   which to obtain channel bindings data for a TLS connection.

3.  The 'tls-unique' Channel Binding Type

   IANA is hereby directed to update the registration of the 'tls-
   unique' channel binding type to match the following.  Note that the
   only material changes from the original registration should be: the
   "owner" (now the IESG), contacts, the published specfication, and a
   clarification to the description by the addition of a parenthetical
   note (that is, the first such note in the descritption is a new
   addition).  We also added a note indicating that this specification
   contains applicability advice, and we moved security considerations
   notes to the security considerations section of this document.  All
   other fields of the registration are copied here for the convenience
   of readers.

3.1.  Description

   Description: The client's TLS Finished message (note: the Finished
   struct) from the first handshake of the connection (note: connection,
   not session, so that the channel binding is specific to each
   connection regardless of whether session resumption is used).

3.2.  Registration

   o  Channel binding unique prefix: tls-unique

   o  Channel binding type: unique

   o  Channel type: TLS [RFC5246]

4.  The 'tls-server-end-point' Channel Binding Type

   IANA is hereby directed to update the registration of the 'tls-
   server-end-point' channel binding type to match the following.  Note
   that the only material changes from the original registration should
   be: the "owner" (now the IESG), the contacts, the published
   specfication, and a note indicating that the published specification
   should be consulted for applicability advice.  References were added
   to the description.  All other fields of the registration are copied
   here for the convenience of readers.

4.1.  Description

   Description: The hash of the TLS server's end entity certificate
   [RFC5280] as it appears, octet for octet, in the server's Certificate
   message (note that the Certificate message contains a
   certificate_list, the first element of which is the server's end
   entity certificate.)  The hash function to be selected is as follows:
   if the certificate's signature hash algorithm is either MD5 [RFC1321]
   or SHA-1 [RFC3174], then use SHA-256 [FIPS-180-2], otherwise use the
   certificate's signature hash algorithm.

   The reason for using a hash of the certificate is that some
   implementations need to track the channel binding of a TLS session in
   kernel-mode memory, which is often at a premium.

4.2.  Registration

   o  Channel binding unique prefix: tls-server-end-point

   o  Channel binding type: end-point

   o  Channel type: TLS [RFC5246]

   o  Published specification: <this document>

   o  Channel binding is secret: no

   o  Description: <See specification>

   o  Intended usage: COMMON

      Zhu (lzhu@microsoft.com), Nicolas Williams
      (Nicolas.Williams@sun.com).

   o  Owner/Change controller name and email address: IESG.

5.  The 'tls-unique-for-telnet' Channel Binding Type

   IANA is hereby directed to update the registration of the 'tls-
   unique-for-telnet' channel binding type to match the following.  Note
   that the only material changes from the original registration should
   be: the "owner" (now the IESG), the contacts, the published
   specfication, and a note indicating that the published specification
   should be consulted for applicability advice.  The description is
   also clarified.  We also moved security considerations notes to the
   security considerations section of this document.  All other fields
   of the registration are copied here for the convenience of readers.

5.1.  Description

   Description: There is a proposal for adding a "StartTLS" extension to
   TELNET, and a channel binding extension for the various TELNET AUTH
   mechanisms whereby each side sends the other a "checksum" (MAC) of
   their view of the channel's bindings.  The client uses the first TLS
   Finished messages (note: the Finished struct) from the client and
   server, each concatenated in that order and in their clear text form.
   The server does the same but in the opposite concatenation order
   (server, then client).

5.2.  Registration

   o  Channel binding unique prefix: tls-unique-for-telnet

   o  Channel binding type: unique

   o  Channel type: TLS [RFC5246]

6.  Applicability of TLS Channel Binding Types

   The 'tls-unique-for-telnet' channel binding type is only applicable
   to TELNET [RFC0854], and is available for all TLS connections.

   The 'tls-unique' channel binding type is available for all TLS
   connections, while 'tls-server-end-point' is only available when TLS
   cipher suites with server certificates are used, specifically: cipher
   suites that use the Certificate handshake message, which typically
   involve the use of PKIX [RFC5280].  For example, 'tls-server-end-
   point' is available when using TLS ciphers suites such as (this is
   not an exhaustive list):

   o  TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_*

   o  TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_*

   o  TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_*

   o  TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_*

   o  TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_*

   o  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_*

   o  TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_*

   o  TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_*

   o  TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_*

   o  TLS_RSA_WITH_*

   o  TLS_SRP_SHA_DSS_WITH_*

   o  TLS_SRP_SHA_RSA_WITH_*

   but is not available when using TLS cipher suites such as (this is
   not an exhaustive list):

   o  TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_*

   o  TLS_DH_anon_WITH_*

   o  TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_*

   o  TLS_ECDH_anon_WITH_*

Internet-Draft            TLS Channel Bindings                 June 2009


   o  TLS_KRB5_WITH_*

   o  TLS_PSK_WITH_*

   o  TLS_SRP_SHA_WITH_*

   Nor is this channel binding type available for use with OpenPGP
   server certificates [RFC5081] [RFC4880] (since these don't use the
   Certificate handshake message).

   Therefore 'tls-unique' is generally better than 'tls-server-end-
   point'.  However, 'tls-server-end-point' may be used with existing
   TLS server-side proxies ("concentrators") without modification to the
   proxies, whereas 'tls-unique' may require firmware or software
   updates to server-side proxies.  Therefore there may be cases where
   'tls-server-end-point' may interoperate but where 'tls-unique' may
   not.

   Also, authentications mechanisms may arise which depend on channel
   bindings to contribute entropy, in which case unique channel bindings
   would have to always be used in preference to end-point channel
   bindings.  At this time there are no such mechanisms, though one such
   SASL mechanism has been proposed.  Whether such mechanisms should be
   allowed is out of scope for this document.

   In other words, for many applications there may be two potentially
   applicable TLS channel binding types.  Channel binding is all or
   nothing for the GSS-API [RFC2743], and likely other frameworks.
   Therefore agreement on the use of channel binding, and a particular
   channel binding type is necessary.  Such agreement can be obtained a
   priori, by convention, or negotiated.

   The specifics of whether and how to negotiate channel binding types
   are beyond the scope of this document.  However, it is RECOMMENDED
   that application protocols making use of TLS channel bindings, use
   'tls-unique' exclusively, except, perhaps, where server-side proxies
   are common in deployments of an application protocol.  In the latter
   case an application protocol MAY specify that 'tls-server-end-point'
   channel bindings must be used when available, with 'tls-unique' being
   used when 'tls-server-end-point' channel bindings are not available.
   Alternatively, the application may negotiate which channel binding
   type to use, or may make the choice of channel binding type
   configurable.

   Specifically, application protocol specifications MUST indicate at
   least one mandatory to implement channel binding type, MAY specify a
   negotiation protocol, MAY allow for out-of-band negotiation or
   configuration, and SHOULD have a preference for 'tls-unique' over

7.  Required Application Programming Interfaces

   TLS implementations supporting the use of 'tls-unique' and/or 'tls-
   unique-for-telnet' channel binding types, MUST provide application
   programming interfaces by which applications (clients and servers
   both) may obtain the channel bindings for a TLS connection.  Such
   interfaces may be expressed in terms of extracting the channel
   bindings data for a given connection and channel binding type.
   Alternatively the implementor may provide interfaces by which to
   obtain the initial client Finished message, the initial server
   Finished message and/or the server certificate (in a form that
   matches the description of the 'tls-server-end-point' channel binding
   type).  In the latter case the application has to have knowledge of
   the channel binding type descriptions from this document.  This
   document takes no position on which form these application
   programming interfaces must take.

   type registrations.  See the rest of this document.

9.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations section of [RFC5056] applies to this
   document.

   The TLS Finished messages (see section 7.4.9 of [RFC5246]) are known
   to both endpoints of a TLS connection, and are cryptographycally
   bound to it.  Therefore the TLS Finished messages can be safely used
   as a channel binding provided that the authentication mechanism doing
   the channel binding conforms to the requirements in [RFC5056].

   The server certificate, when present, is also cryptographically bound
   to the TLS connection through its use in key transport and/or
   authentication of the server (either by dint of its use in key
   transport, by its use in signing key agreement, or by its use in key
   agreement).  Therefore the server certificate is suitable as an end-
   point channel binding as described in [RFC5056].

9.1.  Cryptographic Algorithm Agility

   The 'tls-unique' and 'tls-unique-for-telnet' channel binding types do
   not add any use of cryptography beyond that used by TLS itself.
   Therefore these two channel binding types add no considerations with
   respect to cryptographic algorithm agility.

   The 'tls-server-end-point' channel binding type consist of a hash of
   a server certificate.  The reason for this is to produce manageably
   small channel binding data, as some implementations will be using
   kernel-mode memory (which is typically scarce) to store these.  This
   use of a hash algorithm is above and beyond TLS's use of
   cryptography, therefore the 'tls-server-end-point' channel binding
   type has a security consideration with respect to hash algorithm
   agility.  The algorithm to be used, however, is derived from the
   certificate itself: use SHA-256 if the certificate uses MD5 or SHA-1,
   else use whatever hash function the certificate uses.  This
   construction automatically makes 'tls-server-end-point' hash
   algorithm agile and depends on PKIX and TLS for hash agility.

9.2.  On Disclosure of Channel Bindings Data by Authentication
      Mechanisms

   When these channel binding types were first considered, one issue
   that some commenters were concerned about was the possible impact on
   the security of the TLS channel, of disclosure of the channel
   bindings data by authentication mechanisms.  This can happen, for
   example, when an authentication mechanism transports the channel
   bindings data, with no confidentiality protection, over other
   transports (for example, in communicating with a trusted third



Altman, et al.          Expires December 31, 2009              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft            TLS Channel Bindings                 June 2009


   party), or when the TLS channel provides no confidentiality
   protection and the authentication mechanism does not protect the
   confidentiality of the channel bindings data.  This section considers
   that concern.

   When the TLS connection uses a cipher suite that does not provide
   confidentiality protection, the TLS Finished messages will be visible
   to eavesdroppers, regardless of what the authentication mechanism
   does.  The same is true of the server certificate which, in any case,
   is generally visible to eavesdroppers.  Therefore we must consider
   our choices of TLS channel bindings here to be safe to disclose by
   definition -- if that were not the case then TLS with cipher suites
   that don't provide confidentiality protection would be unsafe.
   Furthermore, the TLS Finished message construction depends on the
   security of the TLS PRF, which in turn needs to be resistant to key
   recovery attacks, and we think that it is, as it is based on HMAC,
   and the master secret is, well, secret (and the result of key
   exchange).

   Note too that in the case of an attempted active man-in-the-middle
   attack, the attacker will already possess knowledge of the TLS
   finished messages for both inbound and outbound TLS channels (which
   will differ, given that the attacker cannot force them to be the
   same).  No additional information is obtained by the attacker from
   the authentication mechanism's disclosure of channel bindings data --
   the attacker already has it, even when cipher suites providing
   confidentiality protection are provided.

   None of the channel binding types defined herein produce channel
   bindings data that must be kept secret.  Moreover, none of the
   channel binding types defined herein can be expected to be private
   (known only to the end-points of the channel), except that the unique
   TLS channel binding types can be expected to be private when a cipher
   suite that provides confidentiality protection is used to protect the
   Finished message exchanges and the application data records
   containing application-layer authentication messages.
