               Prefix Pool Option for DHCPv6 Relay Agent
                draft-yeh-dhc-dhcpv6-prefix-pool-opt-01

Abstract

   The Prefix Pool option provides an automatic mechanism for the
   messages exchange between DHCPv6 server and DHCPv6 Relay Agent.  The
   information about Prefix Pools maintained on DHCPv6 server can be
   transferred from server to relay agent through this DHCPv6 option to
   support the necessary route aggregation on the provide edge router,
   which has a huge number of routes pointing to the customer networks
   before.

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Prefix Pool Option           October 2010


1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 Relay Agents [RFC3315] are deployed to relay messages between
   clients and servers when they are not on the same link, and are often
   implemented along with a routing function on the provider edge (PE)
   routers [BBF WT-177].  Meanwhile, the PE router always employ the
   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation [RFC3633] as the mechanism for the automated
   delegation of IPv6 prefix to the customer network.

   In order to make the customer network to be reachable in the IPv6
   network, the PE routers always need to add or remove the route entry
   directing to each customer network in its routing table per the
   messages between DHCPv6 Server (Delegation Router) and Customer
   router (CPE, DHCPv6 Client, DHCPv6 Requesting Router) when the PE
   router acts as DHCPv6 Relay Agent [BBF WT-177].

   When the routing protocol is enabled on the network-facing interface
   of the PE router, all the routes directing to the customer networks
   are supposed to advertise in the ISP core network.  This will make
   the number of entries in the routing table on the ISP core router to
   be unacceptable huge, so that it is necessary to aggregate the routes
   directing to the customer networks on the PE router.

   Because the prefixes of the customer networks can not guarantee
   always to be valid and continuous, the routing protocol on the PE
   router can not make one aggregation route automatically to cover all
   the prefixes delegated to the customer networks, which are associated
   to the same client-facing link of the PE.  On the other hand, the
   information of the prefix pools associated to each client-facing
   interface of PEs is always maintained on the DHCPv6 server.

   When the PE router acts as the DHCPv6 Server, the aggregation routes
   (eg. black-hole routes) can be generated by the information of the
   prefix pools directly, but when the PE router acts as the DHCPv6
   Relay Agent, a new mechanism to transfer the information of the
   prefix pools from the server to the relay agent for each client-
   facing interface of the PE is requested.

   After the PE got the information of the prefix pools associated to
   its client-facing interfaces, the aggregation route entries pointing
   to each of the prefix pools can be added or withdrawed in the routing
   table of PE.  When the routing protocol is enabled on PE's network-
   facing interface, the above aggregation route pointing to all of the
   customer networks attached on the same link of the PE's client-facing
   interface will be advertised to the whole ISP network.

2.  Terminology and Language

   This document describes new DHCPv6 options of prefix pool and the
   associated mechanism for the configuration on the Relay Agent.  This
   document should be read in conjunction with the DHCPv6 specification,
   RFC 3315 and RFC 3633, for a complete mechanism.  Definitions for
   terms and acronyms not specifically defined in this document are
   defined in RFC 3315, RFC 3633 and RFC 3769 [RFC3769].

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

5.  Relay Agent Behavior

   The Relay Agent who needs the information of prefix pools from the
   server, shall includes Option Request Option (OPTION_ORO, 6) to
   request Prefix Pool option from the server, who maintains the status
   of the prefix pools associated to the particular client-facing
   interface of the Relay Agent where receiving the message from
   clients.  The Relay Agent may include the ORO for Prefix Pool Option
   in the relay-forward (12) message of SOLICIT (1), REQUEST (3), RENEW
   (5), REBIND (6) and RELEASE (8).

   The Relay Agent should includes Interface ID option
   (OPTION_INTERFACE_ID, 18) for the server to identify the associated
   interface on which the prefix pool is configured, if the Server would
   not like to use link-address specified in the DHCPv6 message
   encapsulation of relay-forward message to identify the interface of
   the link on which clients are located.

Internet-Draft          DHCPv6 Prefix Pool Option           October 2010


   After received the Prefix Pool option for that particular client-
   facing interface in the relay-reply message (13) message of REPLY (7)
   from the server, the Relay Agent shall add or remove the aggregation
   route entry per the status of the prefix pool.  If the status of the
   prefix pool got from the server is 'Valid', the Relay Agent shall add
   an aggregation route entry in its routing table if the same entry has
   not been added in.  If the status of the prefix pool got from he
   server is 'Released', the Relay Agent shall withdraw the associated
   aggregation route entry in its routing table.

   The Relay Agent advertises its routing table including the entries of
   the aggregation routes based on the information of prefix pools when
   the routing protocol is enabled on its network-facing interface.


6.  Server Behavior

   Per RFC3633, if the prefix of the customer network associated to the
   IA_PD option in relay-forward message of SOLICIT , REQUEST, RENEW,
   REBIND is indicated to be valid on the Server, the Server (delegating
   router) will delegate the prefix of the customer network with the
   relevant parameters to the client (requesting router, customer
   router) in the relay-reply message of REPLY.

   The Server shall use the Interface ID included in the relay-forward
   message by the relay agent to identify the client-facing interface of
   the relay agent on which the associated prefix pool will be
   configured.  Per RFC3315, the Server may include the same Interface
   ID option in the relay-reply message.

   After receives the ORO in the relay-forward message, the Server must
   include Prefix Pool option with the status indicated for the
   associated client-facing interface of the relay agent in the relay-
   reply message of REPLY.

   The status of 'Valid' in the Prefix Pool option can be used to set up
   the prefix pool and the associated aggregation route on the relay
   agent; while the status of 'Released' in the Prefix Pool option can
   be used to withdraw the configuration of the prefix pool and the
   associated aggregation route on the relay agent.

   On the other hand, if the prefix of the customer network associated
   to the IA_PD option in the relay-forward message of RELEASE is the
   last releasing prefix within the associated prefix pool, the Server
   (delegating router) shall turn the status of the associated prefix
   pool to be 'Released'.  After receives the ORO in the relay-forward
   message, the Server must include Prefix Pool option with the status
   of 'Released' for the associated client-facing interface of the relay

   agent in the relay-reply message of REPLY.

   Note that multiple prefix pools may associate with the same client-
   facing interface of the PE router implementing Relay Agent in the
   binding table on the Server, and the status of the prefix pools
   associated to each of client-facing interface of the PE router
   implementing Relay Agent in the binding table can be reset by the
   administrator of the Server.

   When the status of prefix pool is reset by manual configuration, the
   Server shall initiate the relay-reply message of RECONFIGURE (10), if
   there is at least one prefix indicated to be valid within the
   associated prefix pool on the Server.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security issues related DHCPv6 are described in section 23 of RFC
   3315.


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to Option_Prefix_Pool from
   the "DHCPv6 and DHCPv6 options" registry (http://www.iana.org/
   assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xml).
