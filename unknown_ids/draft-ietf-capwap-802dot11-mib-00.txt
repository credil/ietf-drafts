Internet-Draft         CAPWAP Protocol Binding MIB             June 2008


1.  Introduction

   Current work is under way in the IETF to specify the CAPWAP Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-specification], which enables an Access
   Controller (AC) to manage a collection of Wireless Termination Points
   (WTPs).  CAPWAP supports the use of various wireless technologies by
   the WTPs, with one being specified in the 802.11 binding document
   [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-ieee80211].

   This document defines a MIB module that can be used to manage CAPWAP
   implementations for IEEE 802.11 wireless binding.  This MIB module
   covers both configuration for WLAN and a way to reuse IEEE 802.11 MIB
   standard in series defined by IEEE 802.11 WG.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the
   CAPWAP Protocol specification for 802.11 binding
   [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-ieee80211].  Besides terminology
   defined in the IEEE 802.11 standard and CAPWAP specification, an
   important conception is WLAN service.  In the document, WLAN service
   refers to a logical component instantiated on a WTP device.  A single
   physical WTP may operate a number of WLAN services, and the way is
   called as virtual AP.  Each Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) and
   its constituent wireless terminal radios is denoted as a distinct
   WLAN on a physical WTP.  To support physical WTP with multiple WLANs
   is an important feature for CAPWAP protocol's 802.11 binding, and it
   is also for MIB design.

4.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

5.  Overview

   The [I-D.ietf-capwap-base-mib] provides a way to configure and manage
   WTP and radio objects through SNMP.  It's a basis for manage and
   control a IEEE 802.11 binding.

   The CAPWAP Protocol's IEEE 802.11 binding MIB module (CAPWAP-DOT11-
   MIB) provides a way to configure WLAN service, also could easily
   reuse current and future IEEE 802.11 MIB standards.

   It is designed to satisfy the following requirements and constraints:

   - The MIB module could easily reuse current and future IEEE 802.11
   MIB standard in series defined by IEEE 802.11 WG, and not require to
   redefine them.

   - From AC to centrally manage and configure WLAN service;

   - Operators could configure MAC type and tunnel mode for a specific
   WLAN service by SNMP;

   - The MIB module supports virtual AP;

   Before coming to details of CAPWAP-MIB-DOT11 module, it will
   introduce how it is able to reuse IEEE MIB standard.  As centralized
   Wireless architecture, the operator has to prepare configurations for
   each wireless at AC side before WTPs connect to AC.  Under
   centralized Wireless architectures, according to [I-D.ietf-capwap-
   protocol-specification], each WLAN service is identified by WLAN Id.
   According to IEEE 802.11 MIB standards, the MIB tables such as
   Dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable are able to support wireless
   configuration (such as authentication algorithm), and these tables
   use ifIndex as index.  A Wireless service could be abstracted as an
   interface on the AC side, and which could be identified by ifIndex.
   On the AC side, the MIB table CapwapDot11WirelessConfigTable will
   indicate the mapping relation between a "WLAN Id" and ifIndex of a
   "WLAN Service Interface".  With ifIndex of a "WLAN Service
   Interface", system is able to reuse IEEE MIBs.

6.  Structure of the MIB Module

6.1.  Textual Conventions

   The following textual conventions are defined:

Internet-Draft         CAPWAP Protocol Binding MIB             June 2008


   CapwapDot11WLANId ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS      current
       DESCRIPTION
           "Represents the TC for WLAN Id."
       SYNTAX      Unsigned32

6.2.  The capwapDot11Objects Subtree

   The subtree provides information for configuration parameters of WLAN
   service and binding WLAN service to a specific radio.

6.3.  The capwapDot11Conformance Subtree

   The subtree provides conformance information of MIB objects.

6.4.  Brief Description of MIB Objects

   The MIB objects were derived from the CAPWAP protocol 802.11 binding
   document [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-ieee80211].

   1) capwapDot11WLANConfigTable

   The table is used for providing configuration such as MAC type and so
   on for WLANs.  For a specific WLAN service which is identified by
   capwapDot11WLANId, an interface of 'WLAN Service Interface' ifType
   will be created.  By the ifIndex of interface, it provides a way to
   reuse IEEE 802.11 MIB.  For example, according to
   [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-binding-ieee80211], there is a TLV of
   authentication Type for a WLAN.  In IEEE 802.11 MIB, the MIB object
   dot11AuthenticationAlgorithm in the
   dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable is corresponding to Auth Type TLV.
   Considering both capwapDot11WLANConfigTable and
   dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable use ifIndex as index, CAPWAP-
   DOT11-MIB are able to easily reuse dot11AuthenticationAlgorithm
   object in IEEE 802.11 MIB.  It is same for other IEEE 802.11 MIBs'
   reuse.

   2) capwapDot11WLANBindTable

   The table provides a way to bind WLAN service to a radio, then
   support virtual AP.  The binding operation will dynamically create
   "WLAN BSS Interface", and this logical interface is used for data
   forwarding function.

7.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

Internet-Draft         CAPWAP Protocol Binding MIB             June 2008


7.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB does
   not duplicate those objects.

7.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   The Interfaces Group [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  This memo contains the media-specific
   extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing WLAN service that are
   modeled as interfaces.

   For each WLAN, it will have a logical interface of 'WLAN Service
   Interface' responding to it at AC side.  The interface SHOULD be
   modeled as an ifEntry and provide appropriate interface information.

   To provide data forwarding service, system will dynamically create
   logical interface of 'WLAN BSS Interface'.  The interface SHOULD be
   modeled as an ifEntry and provide appropriate interface information.

   Some specific interpretations of ifTable for CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB are as
   follow.

   1) WLAN Service Interface

      Object          Use for the CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB

   ifIndex         Each interface of 'WLAN Service Interface' type
                   maybe be represented by an ifEntry.

                   always enabled.

   ifOperStatus    This value reflects the actual or operational status
                   of interface. Could be always enabled.
                   Also see [RFC2863].

   ifLastChange    The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface
                   entered its current operational state.
                   Also see [RFC2863].

   The other objects such as ifInOctets, ifOutOctets, ifInErrors,
   ifOutErrors are unused.

   2) WLAN BSS Interface

      Object          Use for the CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB

   ifIndex         Each interface of 'WLAN BSS Interface' type maybe
                   be represented by an ifEntry.

                   or an octet string of zero length.

   ifAlias         The nonvolatile 'alias' name for the interface, as
                   specified by a network manager.

   ifPhysAddress   The physical address of interface.
                   One possible method is for the WTP to assign the
                   address for 'WLAN BSS Interface' using the following
                   algorithm: base BSSID address + WLAN ID.

   ifAdminStatus   This variable indicates the administrator's intent as
                   to whether PHY should be enabled, disabled, or
                   running in some diagnostic testing mode on this

                   frame header validation, including frames with
                   unrecognized label values.

   ifOutErrors     See [RFC2863].

7.3.  Relationship to CAPWAP Base MIB

   The CAPWAP Base MIB provides a way to manage and control WTP and
   radio objects.  Based on it, CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB provides more
   information from WLAN service perspective.

7.4.  Relationship to IEEE 802.11 MIB

   Through ifIndex of 'WLAN Service Interface' and 'WLAN BSS Interface'
   ifType, the MIB module is able to reuse MIB objects in the IEEE
   802.11 MIB.

7.5.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863] and
   CAPWAP-MIB [I-D.ietf-capwap-base-mib].

8.  Example of CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB Usage

   Combining the example in the [I-D.ietf-capwap-base-mib],
   here give a whole example for configuration and management of WTP,
   radio and WLAN object.

   1) Identify each PHY radio by "WTP Virtual Radio Interface"
   According to [I-D.ietf-capwap-protocol-specification], each radio on
   a WTP will be identified by a radio Id. Each WTP could be identified
   by its serial number.
   When configuration for a WTP is prepared before a WTP connects to AC,
   the following information is available in the CapwapRadioBindTable.
   In CapwapRadioBindTable



Shi, et al.             Expires December 30, 2008               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         CAPWAP Protocol Binding MIB             June 2008


   {
        capwapWTPId                     = 12345678
        capwapRadioId                   = 1
        capwapWTPVirtualRadioifIndex    = 10,
        capwapWirelessBinding           = dot11(2),
   }
   Suppose WTP's serial number is 12345678, and first PHY radio's id
   is 1. At AC side, the ifIndex of "WTP Virtual Radio Interface" is
   10 which represents the PHY radio 1.
   By the mechanism of "WTP Virtual Radio Interface", it seemed that WTP
   PHY radios are located at AC side.
   The interface of "WTP Virtual Radio Interface" is modeled by ifTable.
     In ifTable
   {
        ifIndex              = 10,
        ifDescr              = "WTP Virtual Radio Interface",
        ifType               = IANAifType of "WTP Virtual Radio
                               Interface",
        ifMtu                = 0,
        ifSpeed              = 0,
        ifPhysAddress        = 0.0.0.0.0.0,
        ifAdminStatus        = true,
        ifOperStatus         = false,
        ifLastChange         = 0,
        ifInOctets           = 0,
        ifInUcastPkts        = 0,
        ifInDiscards         = 0,
        ifInErrors           = 0,
        ifInUnknownProtos    = 0,
        ifOutOctets          = 0,
        ifOutUcastPkts       = 0,
        ifOutDiscards        = 0,
        ifOutErrors          = 0,
    }

   2) Configure IEEE 802.11 wireless binding parameters for "WTP Virtual
   Radio Interface"
   It will be done at the AC side through IEEE 802.11 MIB.
   For example, to configure parameter for "WTP Virtual Radio Interface"
   by IEEE 802.11 Dot11OperationTable.
   In Dot11OperationTable
   {
        ifIndex                         = 10,
        dot11MACAddress                 = 0.0.0.0.0.0,
        dot11RTSThreshold               = 2347,
        dot11ShortRetryLimit            = 7,
        dot11LongRetryLimit             = 4,
        dot11FragmentationThreshold     = 256,

        dot11MaxTransmitMSDULifetime    = 512,
        dot11MaxReceiveLifetime         = 512,
        dot11ManufacturerID             = "capwap",
        dot11ProductID                  = "capwap"
   }
   In the example, it supposes ifIndex of a "WTP Virtual Radio
   Interface" is 10.

   3) Configure WLAN service
   WLAN service configuration will be done through CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB
   and IEEE 802.11 MIB.
   First step is to create a "WLAN Service Interface" through
   CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB at AC side.
   In CapwapDot11WLANConfigTable
   {
    capwapDot11WLANId                 = 1,
    capwapDot11WLANServiceIfIndex     = 20,
    capwapWTPMACType                  = splitMAC(2),
    capwapWTPTunnelMode               = dot3Tunnel,
    capwapDot11WLANConfigRowStatus    = create

   Here supposes to configure a WLAN service which is identified by
   capwapDot11WLANId 1. A "WLAN Service Interface" is created for it
   and identified by ifIndex 20.
   Corresponding to "WLAN Service Interface", it SHOULD be modeled as an
   ifEntry at AC side and provide appropriate interface information.
   In ifTable
   {
        ifIndex              = 20,
        ifDescr              = "WLAN Service Interface",
        ifType               = IANAifType of "WLAN Service Interface",
        ifMtu                = 0,
        ifSpeed              = 0,
        ifPhysAddress        = 0.0.0.0.0.0,
        ifAdminStatus        = true,
        ifOperStatus         = true,
        ifLastChange         = 0,
        ifInOctets           = 0,
        ifInUcastPkts        = 0,
        ifInDiscards         = 0,
        ifInErrors           = 0,
        ifInUnknownProtos    = 0,
        ifOutOctets          = 0,
        ifOutUcastPkts       = 0,
        ifOutDiscards        = 0,
        ifOutErrors          = 0
   }
   Second step is to configure WLAN parameters of "WLAN Service

   Interface" through IEEE 802.11 MIB at AC side.
   In Dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable
   {

        ifIndex                                = 20,
        dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsIndex     = 1,
        dot11AuthenticationAlgorithm           = Shared Key,
        dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsEnable    = true
   }
   Here ifIndex 20 is for interface of "WLAN Service Interface"
   ifType. Suppose the index of authentication algorithm is 1.

   4) Bind WLAN service to WTP radio
   At AC side, through CapwapDot11WLANBindTable, it configures which
   WLAN service (identified by capwapDot11WLANId) will be provided on
   which radio (identified by ifIndex). Suppose capwapWTPMACType of WLAN
   service is splitMAC(2), the interface of 'WLAN BSS Interface'
   will be created at AC side.
   The AC will use it for split data forwarding. Here supposes ifIndex
   of interface in 'WLAN BSS Interface' ifType is 30.
   In CapwapDot11WLANBindTable
   {
        ifIndex                        = 10,
        capwapDot11WLANId              = 1,
        capwapDot11WLANBSSIfIndex      = 30,
        capwapDot11WLANBSSRowStatus    = create
   }

   5) WTP reports its current configuration status
   After join phase and before WTP get configuration from AC, it will
   report its current configuration status to AC through configuration
   status message. The MIB data will be updated at AC side.
   For example, for the 802.11 binding, WTP will update data in the
   ifTable and IEEE 802.11 MIB so on according to message content.
   As a example for ifIndex 10 (which identify an interface of
   "WLAN Virtual Radio Interface" ifType), its ifOperStatus in ifTable
   will be updated with current radio operational status in the message.

   6) Query WTP and radio statistics data
   After WTPs come to run status, administrator could query WTP and
   radio statistics data through CAPWAP-MIB and CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB.
   For example, through dot11CountersTable in the IEEE 802.11 MIB,
   administrator could query counter data for radio which is identified
   by ifIndex of a "WLAN Virtual Radio Interface".

   7) Query other statistics data
   For example, administrator could query the configuration of
   WLAN service through Dot11AuthenticationAlgorithmsTable.

10.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  - Unauthorized changes to the capwapDot11WLANConfigTable and
      capwapDot11WLANBindTable may disrupt allocation of resources in
      the network, also change the behavior of WLAN system such as MAC
      type.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

Internet-Draft         CAPWAP Protocol Binding MIB             June 2008


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

11.  IANA Considerations

11.1.  IANA Considerations for CAPWAP-DOT11-MIB

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        capwapDot11MIB  { mib-2 XXX }

11.2.  IANA Considerations for ifType

   Require IANA to assign a ifType for 'WLAN Service Interface' type.

   Require IANA to assign a ifType for 'WLAN BSS Interface' type.
