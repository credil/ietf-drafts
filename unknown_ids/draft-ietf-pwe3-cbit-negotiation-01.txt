1. Introduction

   This document describes the problem of control word negotiation 
   mechanism specified in [RFC4447].  Based on the problem analysis, a 
   message exchanging mechanism is introduced to solve this negotiation 
   issue. The control word negotiation mechanism in this document is to 
   update [RFC4447] section 6.2 "PW Types for Which the Control Word is 
   NOT Mandatory".

2. Problem Statement

   [RFC4447] section 6 describes the control word negotiation mechanism. 
   Each PW endpoint has the capability of being configurable with a 
   parameter that specifies whether the use of the control word is 
   PREFERRED or NOT PREFERRED.  While in some case of control word 
   negotiation, PE will advertise C-bit=0 in label mapping message with 
   its locally configured control word PREFERRED.  This kind of behavior 
   will cause some problem when peer PE changes its control word from 
   NOT PREFERRED to PREFERRED.

   This following case will describe the negotiation problem in detail:

             +-------+                    +-------+
             |       |         PW         |       |
             |  PE1  |====================|  PE2  |
             |       |                    |       |
             +-------+                    +-------+
                            Figure 1

       1. Initially, the control word on PE1 is configured to PREFERRED, 
          and on PE2 to NOT PREFERRED.

       2. The negotiation result for the control word for this PW is 
          "not supported", and PE1 send label mapping with C-bit=0 
          finally.

       3. PE2 then changes its control word configuration to PREFERRED.

       4. PE2 will then send label withdraw message to PE1.

       5. According to the control word negotiation mechanism, the 
          received label mapping on PE2 from PE1 indicates C-bit=0, 
          therefore PE2 will still send label mapping with C-bit=0.

   The negotiation result for the PW control word is still "not 
   supported", even though the control word configuration on both PE1 
   and PE2 is set to PREFERRED.

3. Control word re-negotiation by label request message

   In order to solve this problem, the control word re-negotiation is 
   operated by adding label request message.  The control word 
   negotiation mechanism can still follow the procedure described in 
   [RFC4447] section 6.

   When Local PE changes its control word from NOT PREFERRED to 
   PREFERRED and only if it already received the remote label mapping 
   message with C-bit=0, additional procedure will be added as follow:

         -i. Local PE MUST send a label withdraw message to remote PE if 
             it has previously sent a label mapping, and wait until 
             receiving a label release from the remote PE.

        -ii. Local PE MUST send a label request message to remote PE, 
             and wait until receiving a label mapping message containing 
             the remote PE configured control word setting.

       -iii. After receiving remote PE label mapping with control word 
             setting, Local PE MUST follow procedures defined in 
             [RFC4447] section 6 when sending its label mapping message.

   When the peer PE successfully processed the label withdraw and 
   removed the remote label binding, it MUST send label mapping as a 
   response of label request with locally configured control word 
   parameter.

   Note: the FEC element in label request message should be the PE's 
   local FEC element.  Only if FEC element in label request message 
   could bind together with peer PE's local FEC element, the peer PE 
   sends label mapping with its bound local FEC element and label as a 
   response.  The label request message format and procedure is 
   described in [RFC5036].

   The multi-segment PW case for T-PE is same, and the request message 
   MUST be processed in ordered mode.  When S-PE receives a label 
   request message from a remote peer, it MUST advertise the request 
   message to the other remote PE.  This is necessary since S-PE does 
   not have full information of interface parameter field in the FEC 
   advertisement.

   As local T-PE will send label withdraw before sending label request 
   to remote peer, the S-PE MUST send the label withdraw upstream before 
   it advertises the label request.  When S-PE receives the label 
   withdraw, it should process this message to send a label release as a 
   response and a label withdraw to upstream S-PE/T-PE, then process the 
   next LDP message, e.g. the label request message.

   When Local PE changes its control word from PREFERRED to NOT 
   PREFERRED, Local PE would be able to re-negotiate the Control Word to 
   be NOT PREFERRED following the procedures defined in [RFC4447], and 
   no label request message to peer PE will be needed.  In that case, 
   Local PE will always send new label mapping with C-bit reflecting the 
   local Control Word configuration.

   The procedure of PE1 and PE2 for the case in figure 1 should be as 
   follows:

       1. PE2 changes locally configured control word to PREFERRED.

       2. PE2 will then send label withdraw message to PE1.

       3. PE1 will send label release in reply to label withdraw message 
          from PE2.

       4. Upon receipt of Label release message from PE1, PE2 MUST send 
          label request messages to PE1 although it already received the 
          label mapping with C-bit=0.

       5. PE1 MUST send label mapping message with C-bit=1 again to PE2 
          (Note: PE1 MUST send label mapping with locally configured CW 
          parameter).

       6. PE2 receives the label mapping from PE1 and updates the remote 
          label binding information.  PE2 MUST wait for PE1 label 
          binding before sending its label binding with C-bit set, only 
          if it previously had a label binding with C-bit=0 from PE1.

       7. PE2 will send label mapping to PE1 with C-bit=1.

   It is to be noted that the above assume that PE1 is configured to 
   support CW, however in step 5 if PE1 doesn't support CW, PE1 would 
   send the label mapping message with C-bit=0, this would result in PE2 
   in step 7 sending a label mapping with C-bit=0 as per [RFC4447] CW 
   negotiation procedure.

   By sending label request message, PE2 will get the configured CW 
   parameter of peer PE1 in the received label mapping message.  By 
   using the new CW parameter from label mapping message received from 
   peer PE1 and locally configured CW, PE2 should determine the PW CW 
   parameter according to [RFC4447] section 6.

   The diagram in Appendix A in this document updates the control word 
   negotiation diagram in [RFC4447] Appendix A.

4. Backward Compatibility

   Since control word re-negotiation is operated by adding label request 
   message, and still follows the procedure described in [RFC4447] 
   section 6, it is fully compatible with existing implementations.  The 
   remote PE (PE1 in figure 1) which already implement label request 
   message could be compatible with the PE (PE2 in figure 1) following 
   the mechanism of this document.

5. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any additional security constraints.

6. IANA Considerations

   This document does not require IANA assignment.

Appendix B. Alternative proposal by "Label Release" message

   We refer to the proposal in section 3 as "Label Request" message 
   proposal. There is an alternative proposal to re-negotiate control 
   word by sending label release with a new LDP status error code "PW 
   Reset C-bit negotiation".  When this label release is received by the 
   S-PE in MS-PW case, it must forward it back to the T-PE. When the 
   T-PE receives the label release with this error code, it must send a 
   label withdraw followed by a new label mapping even if its C-bit 
   remains the same.

   The procedure of PE1 and PE2 for the case in figure 1 should be as 
   follows:

       1. PE2 changes locally configured control word to PREFERRED.

       2. PE2 will then send label withdraw message to PE1, and label 
          release with a new LDP status error code "PW Reset C-bit 
          negotiation" to PE1.

       3. PE2 will then send label mapping with C-bit=1 as per RFC4447.

       4. PE1 will send label release in reply to label withdraw message 
          from PE2.

       5. Upon receipt of label release with error code "PW Reset C-bit 
          negotiation" from PE2, PE1 MUST withdraw its label mapping and 
          re-advertise with the configured C-bit=1.

       6. PE2 receives the label mapping from PE1 with C-bit=1, and 
          re-negotiates to get the result of C-bit=1 as per RFC4447.

   Both "Label Request" and "Label Release" message proposals work to 
   resolve the control word negotiation problem described in this 
   document.  We do not choose the "Label Release" message proposal for 
   the following backward compatible reasons:

       1. PE1 always needs to be updated, while the "label request" 
          message proposal has better backward compatibility as 
          described in section 4.

       2. S-PE needs to be updated in MS-PW case, while it is not 
          necessary in the "label request" message proposal.
