Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                  October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of the
   Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) [NHDP] process on a router.
   The NHDP MIB also reports state information, performance information
   and notifications.  This additional state and performance information
   is useful to management stations troubleshooting neighbor discovery
   problems.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The NHDP protocol allows routers in a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET)
   setting to discover and track one-hop and two-hop neighbor sets.
   This information is useful for routers running various routing and
   multicast flooding protocols developed within the IETF MANET Working
   Group.

4.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB.

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                  October 2009


   o  Tunable Configuration Objects - objects whose values affect timing
      or attempt bounds on the NHDP protocol.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the NHDP protocol process in the
      router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      NHDP protocol process on the router and the overall discovery
      performance within the NHDP domain.

4.2.  Organization

   This document is organized as ...

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the NHDP MIB module.  The MIB
   is arranged into the following structure:

   o  nhdpNotifications - objects defining NHDP MIB notifications.

   o  nhdpObjects - defining objects within this MIB.  The objects are
      arranged into the following groups:

   o

      *  General Information Group - defining objects of a general
         nature, e.g., version numbers.

      *  Configuration Group - defining objects related to the
         configuration of the NHDP instance on the device.

      *  State Group - defining objects which reflect the current state
         of the NHDP running on the device.

      *  Performance Group - defining objects which are useful to a
         management station when characterizing the performance of the
         NHDP on the device and in the MANET.

   o  nhdpConformance - defining the minimal and maximal conformance
      requirements for implementations of this MIB.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   This section is TBD.

5.2.  The General Information Group

   This section provides general information about the capabilities of
   the device running the NHDP.  This group is currently empty and will
   be removed in future drafts if no objects are identified.

5.3.  The Configuration Group

   The device is configured with a set of controls.  These will serve as
   the object descriptions once they are discussed and refined.  The
   list of configuration controls for the NHDP-MIB (found in [ietf-
   manet-nhdp]), are discussed in the following subsections.

5.3.1.  Interface Parameters

   The Interface Parameters include:

5.3.1.1.  Message Intervals

   o  HELLO_INTERVAL - is the maximum time between the transmission of
      two successive HELLO messages on this MANET interface.  If using
      periodic transmission of HELLO messages, these SHOULD be at a
      separation of HELLO_INTERVAL, possibly modified by jitter as
      specified in [XXX].

   o  HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL - is the minimum interval between transmission
      of two successive HELLO messages, on this MANET interface.  (This
      minimum interval MAY be modified by jitter, as defined in [XXX].)

   o  REFRESH_INTERVAL - is the maximum interval between advertisements
      in a HELLO message of each 1-hop neighbor address and its status.
      In all intervals of length REFRESH_INTERVAL, a router MUST include
      all 1-hop neighbor information which it is specified as sending in
      at least one HELLO message on this MANET interface.

   The following constraints apply to these interface parameters:

   o  HELLO_INTERVAL > 0

   o  HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL >= 0

   o  HELLO_INTERVAL >= HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL





Herberg, et al.          Expires April 24, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                  October 2009


   o  REFRESH_INTERVAL >= HELLO_INTERVAL

   o  If INTERVAL_TIME message TLVs as defined in [XXX] are included in
      HELLO messages, then HELLO_INTERVAL MUST be representable as
      described in [XXX].

   o  If REFRESH_INTERVAL > HELLO_INTERVAL, then a router may distribute
      its neighbor advertisements between HELLO messages in any manner,
      subject to the constraints above.

   o  For a router to employ this protocol in a purely responsive manner
      on a MANET interface, REFRESH_INTERVAL and HELLO_INTERVAL SHOULD
      both be set to a value such that a responsive HELLO message is
      always expected in a shorter period than this.

   The following default values are recommended:

   o  HELLO_INTERVAL = 2 seconds

   o  HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL = HELLO_INTERVAL/4

   o  REFRESH_INTERVAL = HELLO_INTERVAL

5.3.1.2.  Information Validity Times

   Parameters related to the Information Validity Times include:

   o  L_HOLD_TIME - is the period of advertisement, on this MANET
      interface, of former 1-hop neighbor addresses as lost in HELLO
      messages, allowing recipients of these HELLO messages to
      accelerate removal of information from their Link Sets.
      L_HOLD_TIME can be set to zero if accelerated information removal
      is not required.

   o  H_HOLD_TIME - is used as the value in the VALIDITY_TIME message
      TLV included in all HELLO messages on this MANET interface.

   The following constraints apply to these interface parameters:

   o  L_HOLD_TIME >= 0

   o  H_HOLD_TIME >= REFRESH_INTERVAL

   o  If HELLO messages can be lost then both SHOULD be significantly
      greater than REFRESH_INTERVAL.

   o  H_HOLD_TIME MUST be representable as described in [XXX].

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                  October 2009


   o  H_HOLD_TIME = 3 x REFRESH_INTERVAL

   o  L_HOLD_TIME = H_HOLD_TIME

   o  N_HOLD_TIME = L_HOLD_TIME

   o  I_HOLD_TIME = N_HOLD_TIME

5.3.1.3.  Link Quality

   Parameters related to the Link Quality include:

   o  HYST_ACCEPT - is the link quality threshold at or above which a
      link becomes usable, if it was not already so.

   o  HYST_REJECT - is the link quality threshold below which a link
      becomes unusable, if it was not already so.

   o  INITIAL_QUALITY - is the initial quality of a newly identified
      link.

   o  INITIAL_PENDING - if true, then a newly identified link is
      considered pending, and is not usable until the link quality has
      reached or exceeded the HYST_ACCEPT threshold.

   The following constraints apply to these interface parameters:

   o  0 < = HYST_REJECT < = HYST_ACCEPT < = 1

   o  0 < = INITIAL_QUALITY < = 1.

   o  If link quality is not updated, then INITIAL_QUALITY >=
      HYST_ACCEPT.

   o  If INITIAL_QUALITY => HYST_ACCEPT, then INITIAL_PENDING == false.

   o  If INITIAL_QUALITY < HYST_REJECT, then INITIAL_PENDING == true.

   Link quality is a mechanism whereby a router MAY take considerations
   other than message exchange into account for determining when a link
   is and is not a candidate for being considered as HEARD or SYMMETRIC.
   Link quality is used only locally by a router, and routers may fully
   inter-operate whether they are using the same, different or no link
   quality methods.

   NHDP can be operated when the local router does not implement Link
   Quality.  In order for a router to not employ link quality, the
   router MUST define:

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                  October 2009


   o  INITIAL_PENDING = false

   o  INITIAL_QUALITY >= HYST_REJECT (there is no reason not to define
      INITIAL_QUALITY = 1).

   If link quality is changed, then parameter values will depend on the
   link quality process.  If link quality is not changed, then:

   o  HYST_ACCEPT = 1

   o  HYST_REJECT = 0

   o  INITIAL_QUALITY = 1

   o  INITIAL_PENDING = false

5.3.1.4.  Jitter

   If jitter, as defined in [XXX], is used then these parameters are as
   follows:

   o  HP_MAXJITTER - represents the value of MAXJITTER used in [XXX] for
      periodically generated HELLO messages on this MANET interface.

   o  HT_MAXJITTER - represents the value of MAXJITTER used in [XXX] for
      externally triggered HELLO messages on this MANET interface.

   For constraints on these interface parameters see [XXX].

   The following default values are recommended:

   o  HP_MAXJITTER = HELLO_INTERVAL/4

   o  HT_MAXJITTER = HP_MAXJITTER

   o  C = 1/1024 second

5.3.2.  Router Parameters

   The following Router Parameters apply:

5.3.2.1.  Information Validity Time

   o  N_HOLD_TIME - is used as the period during which former 1-hop
      neighbor addresses are advertised as lost in HELLO messages,
      allowing recipients of these HELLO messages to accelerate removal
      of information from their 2-Hop Sets.  N_HOLD_TIME can be set to
      zero if accelerated information removal is not required.

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                  October 2009


   o  I_HOLD_TIME - is the period for which a recently used local
      interface address is recorded.

   The following constraints applies to these router parameters:

   o  N_HOLD_TIME >= 0

   o  I_HOLD_TIME >= 0

5.3.3.  Parameter Change Constraints

   These parameters may be made dynamic:

   o  HELLO_INTERVAL

   o  REFRESH_INTERVAL

   o  HYST_ACCEPT and HYST_REJECT

   o  L_HOLD_TIME

   o  N_HOLD_TIME

   o  HP_MAXJITTER

   o  HT_MAXJITTER

5.4.  The State Group

   The State Subtree reports current state information, including
   neighbor tables.  These are separately discussed below.

   (Note: these will serve as the object descriptions once they are
   discussed and refined.)

   The Local Information Base (LIB), contains the addresses of the
   interfaces (MANET and non-MANET) of this router.  The contents of
   this Information Base are not changed by signaling.  The LIB contains
   two tables:

   o  The "Local Interface Set", which consists of Local Interface
      Tuples, each of which records the addresses of an interface (MANET
      or non- MANET) of the router.

   o  The "Removed Interface Address Set", which consists of Removed
      Interface Address Tuples, each of which records a recently used
      address of an interface (MANET or non-MANET) of the router.  A
      router's Removed Interface Address Set records addresses which

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                  October 2009


      were recently local interface addresses.  If a router's interface
      addresses are immutable then this set is always empty and MAY be
      omitted.

   The Interface Information Based (IIB), recording information
   regarding links to this MANET interface and symmetric 2-hop neighbors
   which can be reached through such links.  The IIB contains two
   tables:

   o  A "Link Set", which records information about current and recently
      lost links between this interface and MANET interfaces of 1-hop
      neighbors.  The Link Set consists of Link Tuples, each of which
      contains information about a single link.  Recently lost links are
      recorded so that they can be advertised in HELLO messages,
      accelerating their removal from relevant 1-hop neighbors' Link
      Sets.  Link quality information, if used and available, is
      recorded in Link Tuples and may indicate that links are treated as
      lost.

   o  A "Two-Hop Set", which records the existence of bidirectional
      links between symmetric 1-hop neighbors of this MANET interface
      and other routers (symmetric 2-hop neighbors).  The 2-Hop Set
      consists of 2-Hop Tuples, each of which records an interface
      address of a symmetric 2-hop neighbor, and all interface addresses
      of the corresponding symmetric 1-hop neighbor.  The 2-Hop Set is
      updated by the signaling of this protocol, but is not itself
      reported in that signaling.

   The Neighbor Information Base (NIB), records information regarding
   current and recently lost 1-hop neighbors of this router.  The NIB
   contains two tables:

   o  The "Neighbor Set", and

   o  The "Lost Neighbor Set".

5.5.  The Performance Group

   The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.
   This section lists objects for NHDP performance monitoring, some of
   which explicitly appear in the NHDP-MIB and others which are
   obtainable through a combination of base objects from this MIB and
   reports available through the REPORT-MIB [REPORT].  Throughout this
   section those objects will be pointed out that are intended as base
   objects which will be explicitly defined within this MIB and those
   objects which are derived through a combination of the base objects
   and capabilities afforded by the REPORT-MIB.

   The objects described in the following can be useful for determining
   certain properties of the NHDP instance.  Notably unstable neighbors
   or 2-hop neighbors and frequent changes of sets can have a negative
   influence on the performance of NHDP.  The following objects thus
   allow to acquire information related to the stability and performance
   of NHDP:

   The following objects return some of the statistics related to HELLO
   messages:

   o  Total number of sent HELLO messages on an interface

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: nhdpIfHelloMessageXmits

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Total number of received HELLO messages on an interface

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: nhdpIfHelloMessageRecvd

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Total number of sent periodic HELLO messages on an interface

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: nhdpIfHelloMessagePeriodicXmits

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Total number of sent triggered HELLO messages on an interface

         This is a Base Object.

         Object name: nhdpIfHelloMessageTriggeredXmits

         Object type: Counter32

   o  Acquire history of HELLO message scheduling instance for the given
      time duration on an interface

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                  October 2009


         This object returns the history of the exact timestamps of each
         HELLO message that has been sent as well as the type of the
         message (triggered or periodical).  The list of events starts
         at the given point of time t0 and ends at the given time t1.

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB.  It
         is derived from the XXX Base Object.

         Object name: nhdpMessageSchedulingHistory

         Object type: SEQUENCE OF (TimeStamp, nhdpMessageType)

   o  Histogram of the intervals between HELLO messages on an interface

         Returns the values (in a 2-dimensional array) that represent a
         histogram of intervals between HELLO messages, separated by
         periodic and triggered HELLOs.  The histogram displays the
         distribution of intervals between two consecutive HELLOs of the
         same type (triggered or periodical) using a given bin size.  It
         includes all HELLOs that have been sent after the given time t0
         and before the given time t1.

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB.  It
         is derived from the XXX Base Object.

         Object name: nhdpMessageSchedulingHistogram

         Object type: SEQUENCE OF (nhdpMessageType, TimeTicks,
         Unsigned32)

   o  Changes of the frequency of the message scheduling on an interface

         This object will divide the given time interval from t0 to t1
         into a given number of equal parts.  It then creates a
         histogram for each part and calculate the distances (using the
         Bhattacharyya distance) between each two adjacent histograms in
         time.  A higher value between two histograms means more
         difference between the histograms.  For instance, that could
         happen if suddenly many triggered HELLO messages are sent,
         whereas before there have been only very few such triggered
         messages.

         This is a Derived Object to be pulled from the REPORT-MIB.  It
         is derived from the XXX Base Object.

   o  Count the changes of the interface over which a given neighbor can
      be reached.

         This object counts each time the neighbor changes the interface
         over which it is reachable.  That means that the corresponding

6.  The Notifications

   The Notifications Subtree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the NHDP MIB and their intended purpose or utility.
   This group is currently empty, pending further discussion.

7.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   [TODO]: The text of this section specifies the relationship of the
   MIB modules contained in this document to other standards,
   particularly to standards containing other MIB modules.  Definitions
   imported from other MIB modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be
   implemented in conjunction with the MIB module contained within this
   document are identified in this section.

7.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The NHDP-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

7.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   [TODO] This section is included as an example; If the MIB module is
   not an adjunct of the Interface MIB, then this section should be
   removed.

7.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   [TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any
   module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a
   REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited
   someplace within the narrative sections.  If there are imported items
   in the MIB module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not already
   cited, they can be cited in text here.  Since relationships to other
   MIB modules should be described in the narrative text, this section
   is typically used to cite modules from which Textual Conventions are
   imported.

   The following NHDP MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB
   [RFC2863]

    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A locally arbitrary unique identifier associated with an
        NHDP neighbor interface.

        All objects of type NeighborIfIndex are assigned by the agent
        out of a common number space. In other words, NeighborIfIndex
        values assigned to entries in one table must not overlap with
        NeighborIfIndex values assigned to entries in another
        table.

        The NeighborIfIndex defines a discovered interface of a 1-hop
        or 2-hop neighbor of the local router.  The agent identifies a
        unique neighbor interface through the reciept of an address
        list advertised through an NHDP HELLO message.

        The value for each discovered neighbor interface must remain
        constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's
        network management system to the next re-initialization, except
        that if an application is deleted and re-created.

        The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP

9.  Security Considerations

   [TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
   contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
   those modules.  This section MUST be patterned after the latest
   approved template (available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).  Remember that the
   objective is not to blindly copy text from the template, but rather
   to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and then state/
   document the result of this evaluation.

   [TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
   include the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] writable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive if
      abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
      security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
      example.

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                  October 2009


   o  [TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
   use the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   [TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
   following boilerplate paragraph.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
      are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
      be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
      information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
      European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)

   o  [TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
   information should have.  The following three boilerplate paragraphs
   should not be changed without very good reason.  Changes will almost
   certainly require justification during IESG review.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                  October 2009


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   [TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
   http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
   submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
   Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
   depending what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section
   3.5 for more information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module
   document.

   [TODO] select an option and provide the necessary details.

   Option #1:


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
   MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in a draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   Here we list the changes made to the various drafts of this MIB.

   We list here the changes made on the draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-mib-00
   draft to generate the draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-mib-01 draft.

   1.  Made and extensive addition in the area of performance
       monitoring.  Added text in the front material, added a
       PerformanceGroup to the MIB and added the PerformanceGroup to the
       Conformance Sections.

   We list here the changes made on the draft-cole-manet-nhdp-mib-01
   draft to generate the draft-ietf-manet-nhdp-mib-00 draft.

   1.  Cleanup up numerous typos and add material to the Conformance
       section in order to pass the MIB checker, i.e., smilint.

   We list here the changes made on the draft-cole-manet-nhdp-mib-00
   draft to generate the draft-cole-manet-nhdp-mib-01 draft.

   1.  Defined the NeighborIfIndex and the NeighborRouterId textual
       conventions.  These identify a remote neighbor IfIndex and a
       remote neighbor router and are used as indexes into NHDP state
       tables.  These constructs were necessary in order to associate
       address lists with specific remote interfaces as required by the
       NHDP protocol specification.

   2.  Developed the nhdpInterfaceTable as part of the configuration
       group.

   3.  Developed the nhdpDiscIfSetTable as a means to associate address
       lists with remotely discovered neighbor interfaces.

   4.  Added tables defining the router's NHDP Local Information Base
       (LIB) as specified in the NHPD protocol specification.

   5.  Added tables defining the router's NHDP Interface information
       Base (IIB) as specified in the NHPD protocol specification.

   6.  Added tables defining the router's NHDP Neighbor Information Base
       (NIB) as specified in the NHPD protocol specification.

   7.  Aligned the NHDP-MIB and the OLSRv2-MIB configuration tables and
       indexing.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the NHDP-MIB.  This section will not be
   present in the final version of the MIB and will be removed once all
   the open issues have been resolved.

   1.   How to handle dynamic parameters within NHDP?  Should we expose
        setting, min and max values?

   2.   Need to address how to handle Link Quality settings and
        parameters for a) optional operation and b) changing nature of
        link quality.

   3.   What notifications are of interest and utility?

   4.   Identify all objects requiring non-volatile storage in their
        DESCRIPTION clauses.

   5.   Incorporate parameter relationship conditions into their
