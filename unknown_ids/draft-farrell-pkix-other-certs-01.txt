Abstract

   Some applications that associate state information with public key
   certificates can benefit from a way to link together a set of
   certificates belonging to the same end entity that can safely be
   considered to be equivalent for the purposes of referencing that
   application state information.  This memo defines a certificate
   extension that supports such linkage that can allow applications to
   establish the required linkage without introducing a new protocol
   data unit.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 3280 [RFC3280] defines a profile for the use of public key
   certificates for Internet applications.  If an application associates
   application state information with a public key certificate, then
   that association may be disrupted if the end entity changes its
   public key certficate.  Such disruption can occur due to renewals or
   if the end entity changes its certificate issuer.  Similarly, if the
   end entity is actually a distributed system, where each instance has
   a different private key, then the relying party has no way to
   assoicate the different public key certificates with the relevant
   application state information.

   For example, assume a web browser retains state information (perhaps
   passwords) about a web site, indexed (possibly indirectly) via values
   contained in the web server's public key certificate (perhaps a DNS
   name).  When the web server certificate expires, and a new certifiate
   is acquired (perhaps with a different DNS name), then the browser
   cannot safely map the new certificate to the relevant state
   information.

   This memo defines a new public key certificate extension that
   supports such linkage.

   Other than the issuer asserting that the set of certificates belong
   to the same end entity, the detailed semantics of the linkage of
   certifcates is not defined here, since that is a matter for
   application developers and the operators of certification authorities
   (CAs).  In particular we do not define how a CA can validate that the
   same end entity is the holder of the various private keys, nor how
   the application should make use of this information.  Nor do we
   define what kinds of state information may be shared.

   CAs MUST however only issue certificates containing this extension
   where the links created are such that the relevant consumers of the
   certificates can safely make use of those links.  This will typically
   be the case where the certificates are only used by a single
   application.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  A Use Case

   Public key certificates expire, typically about a year after they are
   created.  Some applications might need to know that the same entity

   is the subject of this certificate and a previously used certificate.

   For example, if a web server certificate expires, it could be useful
   for a web browser to know that the server currently presenting a
   certificate in a TLS [RFC4346] handshake represents the same web
   server that previously presented a certificate.  This could be used
   for example to allow the browser to automatically fill in form fields
   for the server in question, even if the server certificate has been
   replaced.  While the same effect can be achieved based on the use of
   the same issuer and subject fields in a certificate there could be
   security issues involved in such comparisons, e.g. if the subject
   name includes a DNS name and the ownership of that DNS domain has
   changed.

   The use of the new extension provides a way for the CA to signal to
   the application that the same end entity is involved, regardless of
   name changes.  The new extension could also allow the web site
   operator to more easily change CA when renewing its certificate.


3.  Other Certificates Extension

   This section defines the syntax for the other certificates extension.

   The new extension is simply a list of references to the linked
   certificates.  The references make use of the SCVPCertID structure
   from the SCVP [RFC5055] protocol which contains a hash over the
   relevant certificate and the certificate's issuer and serial number.

   When this extension is present the CA is asserting that the same end
   entity is the subject of the relevant certificates.

   This extension MUST NOT be marked critical.

   id-ce-otherCerts OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::== { id-ce XXX }

   OtherCertificates ::= SEQUENCE OF SCVPCertID


4.  Acknowledgements

   The use case motivating this was contributed to the W3C web security
   context (WSC) working group by Tyler Close.  See
   http://www.w3.org/2006/WSC/wiki/SafeWebFormEditor for details.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   While it should go without saying, relying parties MUST validdate any
   certificates per the algorithm given in RFC 3280 [RFC3280] before
   making any use of those certificates.

   Relying parties similarly MUST NOT assume that any other fields in
   the relevant certificates have common values.  For example, linked
   certificates might have non-overlapping key usage extensions.

   More TBD.  Some warnings for CAs and applications needed.
