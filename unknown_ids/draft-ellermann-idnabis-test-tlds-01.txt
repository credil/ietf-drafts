   documentation, and the like.  In addition, a few second level domain
   names reserved for use as examples are documented.

Internet-Draft        Reserved Top Level DNS Names             June 2008


1.  Introduction

   The global Internet Domain Name System is documented in [RFC1034],
   [RFC1035], [RFC1591], [RFC3696], and numerous additional Requests for
   Comments.  It defines a tree of names starting with root, ".",
   immediately below which are top level domain names such as ".com" and
   ".us".  Below top level domain names there are normally additional
   levels of names.

   The key words "MAY", "RECOMMENDED", and "SHOULD" in this memo are to
   be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  TLDs for Testing, & Documentation Examples

   There is a need for top level domain (TLD) names that can be used for
   creating names which, without fear of conflicts with current or
   future actual TLD names in the global DNS, can be used for private
   testing of existing DNS related code, examples in documentation, DNS
   related experimentation, invalid DNS names, or other similar uses.

   For example, without guidance, a site might set up some local
   additional unused top level domains for testing of its local DNS code
   and configuration.  Later, these TLDs might come into actual use on
   the global Internet.  As a result, local attempts to reference the
   real data in these zones could be thwarted by the local test
   versions.  Or test or example code might be written that accesses a
   TLD that is in use with the thought that the test code would only be
   run in a restricted testbed net or the example never actually run.
   Later, the test code could escape from the testbed or the example be
   actually coded and run on the Internet.  Depending on the nature of
   the test or example, it might be best for it to be referencing a TLD
   permanently reserved for such purposes.

   To safely satisfy these needs, four domain names are reserved as
   listed and described below.

2.1.  ".example"

   ".example" is RECOMMENDED for use in documentation or as examples.

2.2.  ".invalid"

   ".invalid" is intended for use in online construction of domain names
   that are sure to be invalid, and for which it is obvious at a glance
   that they are invalid.  Applications MAY treat ".invalid" as what the
   name says.

2.3.  ".localhost"

   The ".localhost" TLD has traditionally been statically defined in
   host DNS implementations as having an A record pointing to the loop
   back IP address and is reserved for such use.  Any other use would
   conflict with widely deployed code which assumes this use.

2.4.  ".test"

   ".test" is RECOMMENDED for use in testing of current or new DNS
   related code.  Applications SHOULD treat ".test" like any other TLD;
   a special handling could defeat the purpose of a test.


3.  Reserved Example Second Level Domain Names

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) also reserves the
   three second level domain names ".example.com", ".example.net", and
   ".example.org", which can be used in examples as explained in
   Section 2.1.

   When TLDs offer further second level domains for examples, the TLD
   administrators are encouraged to publish the relevant policies in
   their TLD as an informational RFC.

   The second level domain names "nic", "whois", and "www" are often
   reserved or used for the purposes of the TLD administration.  As with
   second level domains for examples this can be an issue in the case of
   a transfer to a new administration.


4.  Internationalization Considerations

   In 2007 IANA created eleven TLDs for tests of Internationalized
   Domain Names (IDN).  The A-labels and corresponding languages are
   listed below; see [RFC3490] or its [IDNAbis] successor for details
   about IDN.  Applications SHOULD treat these IDN test TLDs as
   explained in Section 2.4.

       ".xn--hgbk6aj7f53bba" Persian

       ".xn--kgbechtv"       Arabic
       ".xn--zckzah"         Japanese


5.  Security Considerations

   Confusion and conflict can be caused by the use of a current or
   future top level domain name in experimentation or testing, as an
   example in documentation, to indicate invalid names, or as a synonym
   for the loop back address.  Test and experimental software can escape
   and end up being run against the global operational DNS.  Even
   examples used "only" in documentation can end up being coded and
   released or cause conflicts due to later real use and the possible
   acquisition of intellectual property rights in such "example" names.

   The reservation of several top level domain names for these purposes
   minimizes such confusion and conflict.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA reserves the TLDs ".example", ".invalid", ".localhost", ".test",
   and eleven IDN test TLDs as noted above.  IANA reserves the second
   level domains ".example.com", ".example.net", and ".example.org".

   IANA creates a public registry of reserved TLDs; this can be done
   alongside existing IANA TLD registries at the discretion of IANA.
   Additional reserved TLDs require IETF review as specified in
   [RFC5226] in conjunction with [RFC2860].


7.  Acknowledgments

   This memo contains major parts of [RFC2606] written by Donald E.
   Eastlake and Aliza R. Panitz.  John C. Klensin suggested clarifying
   the guidelines for examples in RFCs.

   Thanks to Tony Hansen, and TBD for their feedback, contributions, or
   encouragement.

   o  Added [IDNAbis] reference.  The author believes that the IETF is
      not entitled to decree that "example.edu" belongs to the set of
      three example-SLDs reserved by IANA.

   Changes in version 00:

   o  Derived from [RFC2606] to resolve a dispute about the use of
      e-mail addresses in RFC examples, adding the eleven new IDN test
      TLDs.
