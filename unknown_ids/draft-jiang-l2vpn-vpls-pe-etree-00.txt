Internet-Draft         VPLS PE Model for E-Tree              March 2010 
    

Abstract 

   A scalable VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model with E-Tree support is 
   proposed in this document. In this model, a Tree VSI is introduced 
   which can provide connectivity for both root VLAN and leaf VLAN for 
   the E-Tree service. MAC address based Ethernet forwarding engine 
   works in the same way as before. As VLAN mapping is needed in the 
   Ethernet PW to keep the VLAN domains in different PEs of the same 
   VPLS instance independent, the PW processing needed for this kind of 
   VLAN mapping is also discussed.

1. Introduction 

   E-Tree service is defined in Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) as multi-root 
   to multi-leaf service, where traffic from a root can reach any root 
   or leaf, and traffic from a leaf can reach any root, but never reach 
   a leaf. 

   [Etree-frwk] gives the requirements and a framework of a solution for 
   the E-Tree in VPLS. [vpls-etree] shows the details of the solution,

   where the Ethernet forwarder in the VPLS is extended to filter the 
   leaf-leaf traffic based on the 3-tuple <ingress port, egress port, CW 
   L-bit>. This solution needs to change the forwarding engine of the 
   VSI, and the control word of the Ethernet PW. 

   This document introduces another solution for E-Tree support in VPLS, 
   which is more compatible with the traditional Ethernet and PW 
   technology, and VPLS scalability and simplicity is also well kept. 

   Firstly, a new VPLS PE model is introduced which consists of a Tree 
   VSI connected to the S-VLAN Bridge with a dual-VLAN interface.  

   This document then discusses the PW encapsulation and PW processing 
   such as VLAN mapping options for transporting E-Tree services in a 
   VPLS. 

   Finally the LDP extensions needed to support this mechanism are also 
   discussed.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. Terminology 

   Most of the terminology used here is from [IEEE802.1Q], [IEEE802.1ad], 
   [RFC4664] and [RFC4762]. Terminology specific to this document is 
   introduced as needed in later sections.  

4. PE Model with E-Tree Support 

4.1. Existing PE Models with E-Tree Support 

   According to [RFC4664], there are at least three models for a VPLS PE, 
   including: 

   o  A single bridge module, a single VSI; 

   o  A single bridge module, multiple VSIs; 

   o  Multiple bridge modules, each attaches to a VSI. 

   The second PE model as depicted in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 is the most 
   suitable one for VPLS [vpls-interop], where the S-VLAN bridge module 
   is connected to multiple VSIs each with a single VLAN interface.

   In the above model, Ethernet service from the CEs will cross multiple 
   stages of bridge modules (i.e., C-VLAN and S-VLAN bridge) to access 
   the egress PWs. Therefore, the association of an AC port and a PW in 
   a single forwarding engine as required in [vpls-etree] is difficult, 
   sometimes even impossible.

Internet-Draft         VPLS PE Model for E-Tree              March 2010 
    

   Asymmetric VLAN is firstly introduced in IEEE 802.1Q, where traffics 
   from the root and the leaves are assigned with different VLANs, so 
   that the switch can filter on each leaf port all the traffic from the 
   VLANs associated with the leaves. 

   This mechanism could be further enhanced by the introduction of a 
   trunk VLAN and a branch VLAN. All the traffics from the trunk VLAN 
   are received both on the roots and the leaves, while traffics from 
   the branch VLAN are received on the roots and dropped on the leaves. 
   It was demonstrated in [ETree-802.1Q] that E-Tree on Ethernet itself 
   could be well provisioned with this mechanism. 

   Should this mechanism be deployed in Ethernet access domain, and if 
   the above VPLS PE model is to be maintained, then it is quite 
   straightforward to infer the following VPLS PE model (as shown in Fig. 
   3) with E-Tree support. But this model will require two VSIs per PE 
   and two sets of full meshed PWs per E-Tree service, which is poorly 
   scalable in a large MPLS/VPLS network.

4.2. A New PE Model with E-Tree Support 

   To provide for E-Tree support in a more scalable way, a new VPLS PE 
   model is proposed as depicted in Fig. 4, where the S-VLAN Bridge 
   module is connected to the Tree VSI (T-VSI, a VSI with E-Tree support) 
   with a dual-VLAN interface. That is, both the trunk S-VLAN and the 
   branch S-VLAN are connected to the Tree VSI (T-VSI). To be more 
   specific, they are called root and leaf S-VLAN respectively in this 
   document. In this way, only one VPLS instance (one VSI per PE) and 
   one set of PWs is needed per E-Tree service. With this model, 
   multiple E-Trees can also be provided by the same T-VSI if needed, 
   and further increase the scalability of VPLS.

   These two VLANs should share the same FIB and work in shared VLAN 
   learning. The traffic from the root UNIs are firstly tagged with root 
   C-VLAN by the C-VLAN bridge module, and then tagged with root S-VLAN 
   by the S-VLAN bridge module, thus can only be transported on the root 
   S-VLAN. Similarly, the traffic from the leaves can only be 
   transported on the leaf S-VLAN.

5. PW for E-Tree Support 

   T-VSIs from peer PEs in a VPLS are inter-connected with a PW, the S-
   VLANs should be independently provisioned on each PE. That is, the 
   assignment of S-VLANs in the PE should be local to simplify the 
   network provisioning. 

   In order to carry both S-VLANs (root and leaf S-VLAN) in a single PW 
   and map them into the remote peer's local S-VLANs, cares must be 
   taken on both the PEs associated with the PW.  

   Two options of VLAN mapping are possible for a PW: 

   o  local mapping, VLAN mapping is usually done when a frame exits the 
      PW. That is, the egress PE is responsible for mapping VLANs into 
      its local VLANs.  

   o  remote mapping, VLAN mapping is done when a frame enters the PW. 
      That is, the remote PE is responsible for mapping VLANs into the 
      local PE's VLANs. 

   Normally, each PE does its own local mapping. But when a PE is not 
   capable of VLAN mapping, then remote mapping must be done on its peer.  

5.1. Tagged Mode PW Encapsulation 

   For a VPLS instance to support E-Tree, the Ethernet PW should work in 
   the tagged mode (PW type 0x0004) as described in [RFC4448], and an S-
   VLAN tag must be carried in each frame in the PW, either the local or 
   the remote S-VLAN tag could be carried depending on the mapping 
   option. In the local mapping mode, the remote S-VLANs are carried 
   with no change, while in the remote mapping mode, the local mapped S-
   VLAN are carried instead. 

   The mapping between the local S-VLAN and the remote S-VLAN (local 
   root S-VLAN <-> remote root S-VLAN; local leaf S-VLAN <-> remote leaf 
   S-VLAN) should be provisioned by management or signaled by a control 
   protocol such as LDP. The LDP extensions for E-Tree support are 
   provided in Section 6. 

5.2. PW Processing 

   Three modes of PW processing are provided for E-Tree in different 
   scenarios.

5.2.1. PW Processing in the Normal Mode 

In the normal mode, two VPLS PE each with a T-VSI in it are inter-
connected and both sides are miscellaneously attached with roots and 
leaves, as shown in the scenario of Fig. 5. At the PE where a frame 
exits the PW, if a frame with the remote leaf VLAN is received, then it 
is mapped to the local leaf VLAN, otherwise, if a frame with the remote 
root VLAN is received, then it is mapped to the local root VLAN.

5.2.2. PW Processing in the Compatible Mode 

   The new VPLS PE model can work in a traditional VPLS network 
   seamlessly in the compatibility mode. As shown in Fig. 6, the VPLS PE 
   with T-VSI can access both root and leaf node, while the VPLS PE with 
   VSI can only access the root node.

   In this case, the PE with a T-VSI in it must work in the compatible 
   mode, that is, the egress PW of the T-VSI must translate frames 
   received over both local root and leaf S-VLAN into a single S-VLAN 
   (local root VLAN if the peer is capable of rewriting the S-VLAN, or 
   the remote peer's S-VLAN otherwise), while the ingress PW only 
   translates the frames received over the PW into the local root VLAN.

5.2.3. PW Processing in the Optimized Mode  

   When two VPLS PE with T-VSI are inter-connected and one side is 
   attached with pure leaves, as shown in the scenario of Fig. 7, the 
   egress PW of the miscellaneous attached PE then work in the optimized 
   mode, that is, the PE can drop all the frames received over the local 
   leaf S-VLAN rather than transport them over the PW and be discarded 
   on the remote PE. Thus bandwidth efficiency of the VPLS can be 
   improved.

6. LDP Extensions for E-Tree Support 

   To dynamically provision the E-Tree service using the signaling 
   procedures specified in [RFC4447], an E-Tree specific interface 
   parameter sub-TLV is proposed as follows:

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                         Figure 8  E-Tree Sub-TLV 

   Where:  

   o  E-Tree is the sub-TLV identifier to be assigned by IANA. 

   o  Length is the length of the sub TLV in octets. 

   o  Reserved bits MUST be set to zero on transmit and be ignored on 
      receive. 

   o  P is a Pure Leaf bit, it is set to 1 to indicate that the PE is 
      attached with all leaves, and set to 0 otherwise. 

   o  R is a request bit of Remote VLAN Translation. If a PE is capable 
      of translating VLANs, then set R to 0, otherwise set R to 1.  

   o  Root VLAN ID is the value of the local root VLAN. 

   o  Leaf VLAN ID is the value of the local leaf VLAN. 

   When the VPLS supporting an E-Tree service is setting up the PW, the 
   PW endpoints negotiate the E-Tree support using the above E-Tree sub-
   TLV. Note PW type of 0x0004 should be used during the PW negotiation. 

   A PE that wishes to support E-Tree service includes in its PW label 
   mapping message an E-Tree Sub-TLV, with its local root VLAN and leaf 
   VLAN carried in the Root VLAN ID and Leaf VLAN ID field respectively.  
   A PE that has E-Tree capability and willing to support it MUST 
   include an E-Tree Sub-TLV with its own local root VLAN and leaf VLAN. 
   A PE that is incapable of translating VLANs MUST set the R bit to 1. 
   And a PE is attached with pure leaves SHOULD set the P bit to 1. 

   If a PE has sent an E-Tree Sub-TLV and has received an E-Tree Sub-TLV, 
   then it must work as described in Section 5.2.1. If a PE receives R=1 
   from its peer, then it must do VLAN translation for this peer, 
   otherwise local mapping rule applies. If the bit P is set, then it 
   should work as described in Section 5.2.3.

   If a PE has sent an E-Tree Sub-TLV and does not receive an E-Tree 
   Sub-TLV, then it must work in the mode of compatibility as described 
   in Section 5.2.2. 

    

7. Security Considerations 

   To be added in the next version. 

    

8. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to allocate a value for E-Tree in the Pseudowire 
   Interface Parameters Sub-TLV type registry.
