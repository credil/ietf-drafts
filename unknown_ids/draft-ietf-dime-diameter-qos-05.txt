Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application           February 2008


Abstract

   This document describes the framework, messages and procedures for
   the Diameter Quality of Service (QoS) application.  The Diameter QoS
   application allows network elements to interact with Diameter servers
   when allocating QoS resources in the network.  In particular, two
   modes of operation -- Pull and Push -- are defined.

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application           February 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the framework, messages and procedures for
   the Diameter Quality of Service (QoS) Application.  The Diameter QoS
   Application allows Network Elements (NEs) to interact with Diameter
   servers when allocating QoS resources in the network.

   Two modes of operation are defined.  In the first, called "Pull"
   mode, the network element requests QoS authorization from the
   Diameter server based on some trigger (such as a QoS signaling
   protocol) that arrives along the data path.  In the second, called
   "Push" mode, the Diameter server pro-actively sends a command to the
   network element(s) to install QoS authorization state.  This could be
   triggered, for instance, by off-path signaling such as Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] call control.

   A set of command codes is specified that allows a single Diameter QoS
   application server to support both Pull and Push modes based on the
   requirements of network technologies, deployment scenarios and end-
   host capabilities.  In conjunction with parameters defined in the
   documents "Quality of Service Attributes for Diameter"
   [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-attributes] and "Quality of Service Parameters for
   Usage with the AAA Framework" [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-parameters], this
   note depicts the basic call flow procedures used to establish, modify
   and terminate a Diameter QoS application session.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The following terms are used in this document:

   AAA Cloud
      An infrastructure of AAA entities (clients, agents, servers)
      communicating via a AAA protocol over trusted, secure connections.
      It offers authentication, authorization and accounting services to
      applications in flexible local and roaming scenarios.  Diameter
      [RFC3588] and RADIUS [RFC2865] are both widely deployed AAA
      protocols.

   Application Endpoint (AppE)
      An Application Endpoint is an entity in an end-user device that
      exchanges signaling messages with Application Servers (see below)
      or directly with other Application Endpoints.  Based on the result
      of this signaling, the Endpoint may make a request for QoS from
      the network.  For example, a SIP Agent is one kind of Application
      Endpoint.

   Application Server (AppS)
      An Application Server is an entity that exchanges signaling
      messages with an Application Endpoint (see above).  It may be a
      source of authorization for QoS-enhanced application flows.  For
      example, a SIP server is one kind of Application Server.

   Authorizing Entity (AE)
      The Authorizing Entity is a Diameter server that supports the QoS
      application.  It is responsible for authorizing QoS requests for a
      particular application flow or aggregate.  The Authorizing Entity
      may be a standalone entity or may be integrated with an
      Application Server and may be co-located with a subscriber
      database.  This entity corresponds to the Policy Decision Point
      (PDP) [RFC2753].

   Network Element (NE)
      A QoS aware router that acts as a Diameter client for the QoS
      application.  This entity triggers the protocol interaction for
      the Pull mode, and it is the recipient of QoS information in the
      Push mode.  The Network Element corresponds to the Policy
      Enforcement Point (PEP) [RFC2753].

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application           February 2008


   Pull Mode
      In this mode, the QoS authorization process is invoked by the QoS
      reservation request received from the Application Endpoint.  The
      Network Element then requests the QoS authorization decision from
      the Authorizing Entity.

   Push Mode
      In this mode, the QoS authorization process is invoked by the
      request from Application Server or local policies in the
      Authorizing Entity.  The Authorizing Entity then installs the QoS
      authorization decision to the Network Element directly.

   Resource Requesting Entity (RRE)
      A Resource Requesting Entity is a logical entity that supports the
      protocol interaction for QoS resources.  The RRE resides in the
      end-host and is able to communicate with peer logical entities in
      an Authorizing Entity or a Network Element to trigger the QoS
      authorization process.

3.  Framework

   The Diameter QoS application runs between a NE (acting as a Diameter
   client) and the resource AE (acting as a Diameter server).  A high-
   level picture of the resulting architecture is shown in Figure 1.

       +------+   +----------+   +------+

               Figure 1: An Architecture Supporting QoS-AAA

   Figure 1 depicts NEs through which media flows need to pass, a cloud
   of AAA servers, and an AE.  Note that there may be more than one
   router that needs to interact with the AAA cloud along the path of a
   given application flow, although the figure only depicts one for
   clarity.

   In some deployment scenarios, NEs may request authorization through
   the AAA cloud based on an incoming QoS reservation request.  The NE
   will route the request to a designated AE.  The AE will return the
   result of the authorization decision.  In other deployment scenarios,
   the authorization will be initiated upon dynamic application state,
   so that the request must be authenticated and authorized based on
   information from one or more AppSs.  After receiving the
   authorization request from the AppS or the NE, the AE decides the
   appropriate mode (i.e.  Push or Pull).  The usage Push or Pull mode
   can be determined by the authorizing entity either statically or
   dynamically.  Static determination might be based on a configurable
   defined policy in the authorizing entity, while dynamic determination

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application           February 2008


   might be based on information received from an application server.
   For Push mode, the authorizing entity needs to identify the
   appropriate NE(s) to which QoS authorization information needs to be
   pushed.  It might determine this based on information received from
   the AppS, such as the IP addresses of media flows.

   In some deployment scenarios, there is a mapping between access
   network type and the service logic (e.g. selection of the Push or
   Pull mode, and other differentiated handling of the resource
   admission and control).  The access network type might be derived
   from the authorization request from the AppS or the NE, and in this
   case, the authorizing entity can identify the corresponding service
   logic based on the mapping.

   If defined properly, the interface between the NEs and AAA cloud
   would be identical whether the AE communicates with an AppS or not.
   Routers are therefore insulated from the details of particular
   applications and need not know that Application Servers are involved
   at all.  Also, the AAA cloud would naturally encompass business
   relationships such as those between network operators and third-party
   application providers, enabling flexible intra- or inter-domain
   authorization, accounting, and settlement.

   resources and determines whether there are enough resources to
   fulfill the request.  Authorization is performed by the Diameter
   client, which involves contacting an authorization entity through the
   AAA cloud shown in Section 3.  If both checks are successful, the
   authorized QoS parameters are set in the packet classifier and the
   packet scheduler.  Note that the parameters passed to the Traffic
   Control function may be different from requested QoS (depending on
   the authorization decision).  Once the requested resource is granted,
   the Resource Management function provides accounting information to
   the AE via the Diameter client.

3.2.  Implications of Endpoint QoS Capabilities

3.2.1.  Endpoint Categories

   The QoS capabilities of Application Endpoints are varied, and can be
   categorized as follows:

   Category 1
      A Category 1 Application Endpoint has QoS capability at neither
      the application nor the network level.  This type of AppE may set
      up a connection through application signaling, but it is incapable
      of specifying resource/QoS requirements through either application
      or network-level signaling.

   Category 2
      A Category 2 Application Endpoint only has QoS capability at the
      application level.  This type of AppE is able to set up a
      connection through application signaling with certain resource/QoS
      requirements (e.g., application attributes), but it is unable to
      signal any resource/QoS requirements at the network level.

   Category 3
      A Category 3 Application Endpoint has QoS capability at the
      network level.  This type of AppE may set up a connection through
      application signaling, translate service characteristics into
      network resource/QoS requirements (e.g., network QoS class)
      locally, and request the resources through network signaling,
      e.g., Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205] or NSIS
      [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp].

3.2.2.  Interaction Modes Between the Authorizing Entity and Network
        Element

   Different QoS mechanisms are employed in packet networks.  Those QoS
   mechanisms can be categorized into two schemes: IntServ [RFC2211],
   [RFC2212] and DiffServ [RFC2474].  In the IntServ scheme, network
   signaling (e.g., RSVP, NSIS, or link specific signaling) is commonly



Sun, et al.              Expires August 25, 2008               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application           February 2008


   used to initiate a request from an AppE for the desired QoS resource.
   In the DiffServ scheme, QoS resources are provisioned based upon some
   predefined QoS service classes rather than AppE-initiated, flow-based
   QoS requests.

   It is obvious that the eligible QoS scheme is correlated to the
   AppE's capability in the context of QoS authorization.  Since
   Category 1 and 2 AppEs cannot initiate the QoS resource requests by
   means of network signaling, the IntServ model is not applicable to
   them in general.  Depending on network technology and operator
   requirements, a Category 3 AppE may either make use of network
   signaling for resource requests or not.

   The diversity of QoS capabilities of endpoints and QoS schemes of
   network technology leads to the distinction on the interaction mode
   between QoS authorization system and underlying NEs.  When the
   IntServ scheme is employed by a Category 3 endpoint, the
   authorization process is typically initiated by a NE when a trigger
   such as network signaling is received from the endpoint.  In the
   DiffServ scheme, since the NE is unable to request the resource
   authorization on its own initiative, the authorization process is
   typically triggered by either the request of AppSs or policies
   defined by the operator.

   As a consequence, two interaction modes are needed in support of
   different combinations of QoS schemes and endpoint's QoS
   capabilities: Push mode and Pull mode.

   Push mode
      The QoS authorization process is triggered by AppSs or local
      network conditions (e.g., time of day on resource usage and QoS
      classes), and the authorization decisions are installed by the AE
      to the network element on its own initiative without explicit
      request.  In order to support the push mode, the AE (i.e.,
      Diameter server) should be able to initiate a Diameter
      authorization session to communicate with the NE (i.e., Diameter
      client) without any pre-established connection from the network
      element.

   Pull mode
      The QoS authorization process is triggered by the network
      signaling received from end-user equipment or by a local event in
      the NE according to pre-configured policies, and authorization
      decisions are produced upon the request of the NE.  In order to
      support the pull mode, the NE (i.e., Diameter client) will
      initiate a Diameter authorization session to communicate with the
      authorizing entity (i.e., Diameter server).

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application           February 2008


   For Category 1 and 2 Application Endpoints, Push mode is required.
   For a Category 3 AppE, either Push mode or Pull mode may be used.

   Push mode is applicable to certain networks, for example, Cable
   network, DSL, Ethernet, and Diffserv-enabled IP/MPLS as defined by
   other SDOs (e.g., ETSI TISPAN and ITU-T}.  The Pull mode is more
   appropriate to IntServ-enabled IP networks or certain wireless
   networks such as the GPRS networks defined by 3GPP.  Some networks
   (for example, WiMAX) may require both Push and Pull modes.

3.3.  Authorization Schemes

3.3.1.  Pull Mode Schemes

   Three basic authorization schemes for Pull mode exist: one two-party
   and two three-party schemes.  The notation adopted here is in respect
   to the entity that performs the QoS authorization.  The
   authentication of the QoS requesting entity might be done at the NE
   as part of the QoS signaling protocol, or by an off-path protocol run
   (on the application layer or for network access authentication) or
   the AE might be contacted with request for authentication and
   authorization of the QoS requesting entity.  From the Diameter QoS
   application's point of view these schemes differ in type of
   information that need to be carried.  Here we focus on the 'Basic
   Three Party Scheme' (see Figure 3) and the 'Token-based Three Party
   Scheme' (see Figure 4).  In the 'Two Party Scheme', the QoS RRE is
   authenticated by the NE and the authorization decision is made either
   locally at the NE itself or offloaded to a trusted entity (most
   likely within the same administrative domain).  In the two-party case
   no Diameter QoS protocol interaction is required.

   In the 'Basic Three Party Scheme' a QoS reservation request that
   arrives at the NE is forwarded to the Authorizing Entity (e.g., in
   the user's home network), where the authorization decision is made.
   A business relationship, such as a roaming agreement, between the
   visited network and the home network ensures that the visited network
   is compensated for the resources consumed by the user via the home
   network.

                 Figure 4: Token-based Three Party Scheme

   The 'Token-based Three Party Scheme' is applicable to environments
   where a previous protocol interaction is used to request
   authorization tokens to assist the authorization process at the NE or
   the AE [RFC3521].

   The QoS RRE may be involved in an application layer protocol
   interaction, for example using SIP [RFC3313], with the AE.  As part
   of this interaction, authentication and authorization at the
   application layer might take place.  As a result of a successful
   authorization decision, which might involve the user's home AAA
   server, an authorization token is generated by the AE (e.g., the SIP
   proxy and an entity trusted by the SIP proxy) and returned to the end
   host for inclusion into the QoS signaling protocol.  The
   authorization token will be used by a NE that receives the QoS
   signaling message to authorize the QoS request.  Alternatively, the
   Diameter QoS application will be used to forward the authorization
   token to the user's home network.  The authorization token allows the
   authorization decision performed at the application layer protocol
   run to be associated with a corresponding QoS signaling session.
   Note that the authorization token might either refer to established
   state concerning the authorization decision or the token might itself
   carry the authorized parameters (protected by a digital signature or
   a keyed message digest to prevent tampering).  In the latter case the

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application           February 2008


   authorization token may contain several pieces of information
   pertaining to the authorized application session, but at minimum it
   should contain:
   o  An identifier for the AE (for example, an AppS) that issued the
      authorization token
   o  An identifier referring to a specific application protocol session
      for which the token was issued and
   o  A keyed message digest or digital signature protecting the content
      of the authorization token

   A possible structure for the authorization token and the policy
   element carrying it are proposed in context of RSVP [RFC3520].

   In the scenario mentioned above, where the QoS resource requesting
   entity is involved in an application layer protocol interaction with
   the AE, it may be worthwhile to consider a token-less binding
   mechanism also.  The application layer protocol interaction may have
   indicated the transport port numbers at the QoS RRE where it might
   receive media streams (for example in SIP/SDP [RFC4566] signalling,
   these port numbers are advertised).  The QoS RRE may also use these
   port numbers in some IP filter indications to the NE performing QoS
   reservation so that it may properly tunnel the inbound packets.  The
   NE performing QoS reservation will forward the QoS resource
   requesting entity's IP address and the IP filter indications to the
   AE in the QoS authorization request.  The AE will use the QoS RRE's
   IP address and the port numbers in the IP filter indication, which
   will match the port numbers advertised in the earlier application
   layer protocol interaction, to identify the right piece of policy
   information to be sent to the NE performing the QoS reservation in
   the QoS authz. response.

3.3.2.  Push Mode Schemes

   The push mode can be further divided into two types: endpoint-
   initiated and network-initiated.  In the former case, the
   authorization process is triggered by AppS in response to an explicit
   QoS request from an endpoint through application signaling, e.g.
   SIP; in the latter case, the authorization process is triggered by
   the AppS without an explicit QoS request from an endpoint.

   In the endpoint-initiated scheme, the QoS RRE (i.e., the AppE)
   determines the required application level QoS and sends a QoS request
   through an application signaling message.  The AppS will extract
   application-level QoS information and trigger the authorization
   process to the AE.  In the network-initiated scheme, the AE and/or
   AppS should derive and determine the QoS requirements according to
   application attribute, subscription and endpoint's capability when
   the endpoint does not explicitly indicate the QoS attributes.  The AE

   makes an authorization decision based on application level QoS
   information, network policies, end-user subscription, network
   resource availability, etc., and installs the decision to NE
   directly.

   A Category 1 AppE requires network-initiated Push mode and a Category
   2 AppE may use either mode

3.4.  QoS Application Requirements

   A QoS application must meet a number of requirements applicable to a
   diverse set of networking environments and services.  It should be
   compatible with different deployment scenarios having specific QoS
   signaling models and security issues.  Satisfying the requirements
   listed below while interworking with QoS signaling protocols, a
   Diameter QoS application should accommodate the capabilities of the
   QoS signaling protocols rather than introducing functional
   requirements on them.  A list of requirements for a QoS authorization
   application is provided here:

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application           February 2008


   Inter-domain support
      In particular, users may roam outside their home network, leading
      to a situation where the NE and AE are in different administrative
      domains.

   Identity-based Routing
      The QoS AAA protocol MUST route AAA requests to the Authorizing
      Entity, based on the provided identity of the QoS requesting
      entity or the identity of the AE encoded in the provided
      authorization token.

   Flexible Authentication Support
      The QoS AAA protocol MUST support a variety of different
      authentication protocols for verification of authentication
      information present in QoS signaling messages.  The support for
      these protocols MAY be provided indirectly by tying the signaling
      communication for QoS to a previous authentication protocol
      exchange (e.g., using network access authentication).

   Making an Authorization Decision
      The QoS AAA protocol MUST exchange sufficient information between
      the AE and the enforcing entity (and vice versa) to compute an
      authorization decision and to execute this decision.

   Triggering an Authorization Process
      The QoS AAA protocol MUST allow periodic and event triggered
      execution of the authorization process, originated at the
      enforcing entity or even at the AE.

   Associating QoS Reservations and Application State
      The QoS AAA protocol MUST carry information sufficient for an AppS
      to identify the appropriate application session and associate it
      with a particular QoS reservation.

   Dynamic Authorization
      It MUST be possible for the QoS AAA protocol to push updates
      towards the NE(s) from authorizing entities.

   Bearer Gating
      The QoS AAA protocol MUST allow the AE to gate (i.e., enable/
      disable) authorized application flows based on, e.g., application
      state transitions.

   Accounting Records
      The QoS AAA protocol may define QoS accounting records containing
      duration, volume (byte count) usage information and description of
      the QoS attributes (e.g., bandwidth, delay, loss rate) that were
      supported for the flow.

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application           February 2008


   Sending Accounting Records
      The NE SHOULD be able to send accounting records for a particular
      QoS reservation state to an accounting entity.

   Failure Notification
      The QoS AAA protocol MUST allow the NE to report failures, such as
      loss of connectivity due to movement of a mobile node or other
      reasons for packet loss, to the authorizing entity.

   Accounting Correlation
      The QoS AAA protocol may support the exchange of sufficient
      information to allow for correlation between accounting records
      generated by the NEs and accounting records generated by an AppS.

   Interaction with other AAA Applications
      Interaction with other AAA applications such as Diameter Network
      Access (NASREQ) application [RFC4005] is required for exchange of
      authorization, authentication and accounting information.


   In deployment scenarios where authentication of the QoS reservation
   requesting entity (e.g., the user) is done by means outside the
   Diameter QoS application protocol interaction, the AE is contacted
   only with a request for QoS authorization.  Authentication might have
   taken place already via the interaction with the Diameter NASREQ
   application or as part of the QoS signaling protocol (e.g., Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC4346] in the General Internet Signaling
   Transport (GIST) protocol [I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp]).

   Authentication of the QoS reservation requesting entity to the AE is
   necessary if a particular Diameter QoS application protocol run
   cannot be related (or if there is no intention to relate it) to a
   prior authentication.  In this case the AE MUST authenticate the QoS
   reservation requesting entity in order to authorize the QoS request
   as part of the Diameter QoS protocol interaction.

   The document refers to three types of sessions that need to be
   properly correlated.

   QoS Signaling Session
      The time period during which a QoS signaling protocol establishes,
      maintains and deletes a QoS reservation state at the QoS network
      element is referred to as QoS signaling session.  Different QoS
      signaling protocols use different ways to identify QoS signaling
      sessions.  The same applies to different usage environments.
      Currently, this document supports three types of QoS session
      identifiers, namely a signaling session id (e.g., the Session
      Identifier used by the NSIS protocol suite), a flow id (e.g.,

      identifier assigned by an application to a certain flow as used in
      the 3GPP) and a flow description based on the IP parameters of the
      flow's end points.

   Diameter Authorization Session
      The time period, for which a Diameter server authorizes a
      requested service (i.e., QoS resource reservation) is referred to
      as a Diameter authorization session.  It is identified by a
      Session-Id included in all Diameter messages used for management
      of the authorized service (initial authorization, re-
      authorization, termination), see [RFC3588].

   Application-layer Session
      The application layer session identifies the duration of an
      application layer service which requires provision of certain QoS.
      An application layer session identifier is provided by the QoS
      requesting entity in the QoS signaling messages, for example as
      part of the authorization token.  In general, the application
      session identifier is opaque to the QoS aware NEs.  It is included
      in the authorization request message sent to the AE and helps it
      to correlate the QoS authorization request to the application
      session state information.


   Correlating these sessions is done at each of the three involved
   entities: The QoS requesting entity correlates the application with
   the QoS signaling sessions.  The QoS NE correlates the QoS signaling
   session with the Diameter authorization sessions.  The AE SHOULD bind
   the information about the three sessions together.  Note that in
   certain scenarios not all of the sessions are present.  For example,
   the application session might not be visible to QoS signaling
   protocol directly if there is no binding between the application
   session and the QoS requesting entity using the QoS signaling
   protocol.

4.  QoS Application Session Establishment and Management

4.1.  Parties Involved

   Authorization models supported by this application include three
   parties:
   o  Resource Requesting Entity
   o  Network Elements (Diameter QoS application (DQA) client)
   o  Authorizing Entity (Diameter QoS application (DQA) server)

   Note that the QoS RRE is only indirectly involved in the message
   exchange.  This entity provides the trigger to initiate the Diameter
   QoS protocol interaction by transmitting QoS signaling messages.  The
   Diameter QoS application is only executed between the Network Element
   (i.e., DQA client) and the Authorizing Entity (i.e., DQA server).

   The QoS RRE may communicate with the AE using application layer
   signaling for negotiation of service parameters.  As part of this
   application layer protocol interaction, for example using SIP,
   authentication and authorization might take place.  This message
   exchange is, however, outside the scope of this document.  The
   protocol communication between the QoS resource requesting entity and
   the QoS NE might be accomplished using the NSIS protocol suite, RSVP
   or a link layer signaling protocol.  A description of these protocols
   is also outside the scope of this document and a tight coupling with
   these protocols is not desirable since this applications aims to be
   generic.

4.2.  Session Establishment

   The Pull and Push modes use a different set of command codes for
   session establishment.  For other operations, such as session
   modification and termination, they use the same set of command codes.

   The selection of Pull mode or Push mode operation is based on the
   trigger of the QoS Authorization session.  When a QoS-Authz-Request
   (QAR, see Section 5.1) message with a new session ID is received, the
   AE operates in the Pull mode; when other triggers are received, the
   AE operates in the Push mode.  Similarly, when a QoS-Install-Request
   (QIR, see Section 5.3} with a new session ID is received, the NE
   operates in the Push mode; when other triggers are received, the NE
   operation in the Pull mode.

4.2.1.  Session Establishment for Pull Mode

   A request for a QoS reservation or local events received by a NE can
   trigger the initiation of a Diameter QoS authorization session.  The
   NE generates a QAR message in which the required objects from the QoS

   signaling message to Diameter AVPs.

   Figure 6 shows the protocol interaction between a Resource Requesting
   Entity, a Network Element and the Authorizing Entity.

   The AE's identity, information about the application session and/or
   identity and credentials of the QoS RRE, requested QoS parameters,
   signaling session identifier and/or QoS enabled data flows
   identifiers MAY be encapsulated into respective Diameter AVPs and
   included in the Diameter message sent to the AE.  The QAR is sent to
   a Diameter server that can either be the home server of the QoS
   requesting entity or an AppS.

            Table 1: Mapping Input Data to QoS AVPs--Pull Mode

   Authorization processing starts at the Diameter QoS server when it
   receives the QAR.  Based on the information in the QoS-
   Authentication-Data, User-Name and QoS-Resources AVPs the server
   determines the authorized QoS resources and flow state (enabled/
   disabled) from locally available information (e.g., policy
   information that may be previously established as part of an
   application layer signaling exchange, or the user's subscription
   profile).  The QoS-Resources AVP is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-attributes].  The authorization decision is then
   reflected in the response returned to the Diameter client with the
   QoS-Authorization-Answer message (QAA).

   state information.

   The final result of the authorization request is provided in the
   Result-Code AVP of the QAA message sent by the Authorizing Entity.
   In case of successful authorization (i.e., Result-Code =
   DIAMETER_LIMITED_SUCCESS, (see Section 7.1)), information about the
   authorized QoS resources and the status of the authorized flow
   (enabled/disabled) is provided in the QoS-Resources AVP of the QAA
   message.  The QoS information provided via the QAA is installed by
   the QoS Traffic Control function of the NE.  The value
   DIAMETER_LIMITED_SUCCESS indicates that the AE expects confirmation
   via another QAR message for successful QoS resource reservation and
   for final reserved QoS resources (see below).

   One important piece of information returned from the Authorizing
   Entity is the authorization lifetime (carried inside the QAA).  The
   authorization lifetime allows the NE to determine how long the
   authorization decision is valid for this particular QoS reservation.
   A number of factors may influence the authorized session duration,
   such as the user's subscription plan or currently available credits
   at the user's account (see Section 8).  The authorization duration is
   time-based as specified in [RFC3588].  For an extension of the
   authorization period, a new QoS-Authorization-Request/Answer message
   exchange SHOULD be initiated.  Further aspects of QoS authorization
   session maintenance is discussed in Section 4.3, Section 4.4 and
   Section 8.

   The indication of a successful QoS reservation and activation of the
   data flow is provided by the transmission of a QAR message, which
   reports the parameters of the established QoS state: reserved
   resources, duration of the reservation, and identification of the QoS
   enabled flow/QoS signaling session.  The Diameter QoS server
   acknowledges the reserved QoS resources with the QA Answer (QAA)
   message where the Result-Code is set to 'DIAMETER_SUCCESS'.  Note
   that the reserved QoS resources reported in this QAR message MAY be
   different than those authorized with the initial QAA message, due to
   the QoS signaling specific behavior (e.g., receiver-initiated
   reservations with One-Path-With-Advertisements) or specific process
   of QoS negotiation along the data path.

4.2.2.  Session Establishment for Push Mode

   The Diameter QoS server in the AE initiates a Diameter QoS
   authorization session upon the request for QoS reservation triggered
   by application layer signaling or by local events, and generates a
   QoS-Install-Request (QIR) message to Diameter QoS client in the NE in
   which it maps required objects to Diameter payload objects.

   Figure 7 shows the protocol interaction between the AE, a Network

   The NE's identity, information about the application session and/or
   identity and credentials of the QoS resource requesting entity,
   requested QoS parameters, signaling session identifier and/or QoS
   enabled data flows identifiers MAY be encapsulated into respective
   Diameter AVPs and included into the Diameter message sent from a
   Diameter QoS server in the Authorizing Entity to a Diameter QoS
   client in the NE.  This requires that the AE has knowledge of
   specific information for allocating and identifying the NE that
   should be contacted and the data flow for which the QoS reservation
   should be established.  This information can be statically configured
   or dynamically discovered, see Section 4.2.3 for details.

   Authorization processing starts at the Diameter QoS server when it
   receives a request from a RRE through an AppS (e.g., SIP Invite) or
   is triggered by a local event (e.g., pre-configured timer).  Based on
   the received information the server determines the authorized QoS
   resources and flow state (enabled/disabled) from locally available
   information (e.g., policy information that may be previously
   established as part of an application layer signaling exchange, or
   the user's subscription profile).  The authorization decision is then
   reflected in the QoS-Install-Request message (QIR) to the Diameter
   QoS client.

   The final result of the authorization decision is provided in the
   QoS-Resources AVP of the QIR message sent by the AE.  The QoS
   information provided via the QIR is installed by the QoS Traffic
   Control function of the NE.

   One important piece of information from the AE is the authorization
   lifetime (carried inside the QIR).  The authorization lifetime allows
   the NE to determine how long the authorization decision is valid for
   this particular QoS reservation.  A number of factors may influence
   the authorized session duration, such as the user's subscription plan
   or currently available credits at the user's account (see Section 8).
   The authorization duration is time-based as specified in [RFC3588].
   For an extension of the authorization period, a new QoS-Install-
   Request/Answer message or QoS-Authorization-Request/Answer message
   exchange SHOULD be initiated.  Further aspects of QoS authorization
   session maintenance is discussed in Section 4.3, Section 4.4 and
   Section 8.

   The indication of QoS reservation and activation of the data flow can
   be provided by the QoS-Install-Answer message immediately.  In the
   case of successful enforcement, the Result-Code (= DIAMETER_SUCCESS,
   (see Section 7.1)) information is provided in the QIA message.  Note
   that the reserved QoS resources reported in the QIA message MAY be
   different than those initially authorized with the QIR message, due
   to the QoS signaling specific behavior (e.g., receiver-initiated
   reservations with One-Path-With-Advertisements) or specific process
   of QoS negotiation along the data path.  When path coupled signaling
   is used for QoS reservation along the data path, QAR/QAA may be used
   to update the results of QoS reservation and enforcement following
   the establishment of data flows.

4.2.3.  Discovery and Selection of Peer Diameter QoS Application Node

   The Diameter QoS application node may obtain information of its peer
   nodes (e.g., FQDN, IP address) through static configuration or
   dynamic discovery as described in [RFC3588].  In particular, the NE
   shall perform the relevant operation for Pull mode; the AE shall
   perform the relevant operations for Push mode.

   Upon receipt of a trigger to initiate a new Diameter QoS
   authorization session, the Diameter QoS application node selects and
   retrieves the location information of the peer node and based on some
   index information provided by the RRE.  For instance, it can be the
   Authorization Entity's ID stored in the authorization token, the end-
   user's identity (e.g., NAI [RFC4282]) or globally routable IP
   address.

4.3.  Session Re-authorization

   Client and server-side initiated re-authorizations are considered in
   the design of the Diameter QoS application.  Whether the re-
   authorization events are transparent for the resource requesting
   entity or result in specific actions in the QoS signaling protocol is
   outside the scope of the Diameter QoS application.  It is directly
   dependent on the capabilities of the QoS signaling protocol.

   There are a number of options for policy rules according to which the
   NE (AAA client) contacts the AE for re-authorization.  These rules
   depend on the semantics and contents of the QAA message sent by the
   AE:

   a.  The QAA message contains the authorized parameters of the flow
       and its QoS and sets their limits (presumably upper).  With these
       parameters the AE specifies the services that the NE can provide
       and will be financially compensated for.  Therefore, any change
       or request for change of the parameters of the flow and its QoS
       that do not conform to the authorized limits requires contacting
       the AE for authorization.
   b.  The QAA message contains authorized parameters of the flow and
       its QoS.  The rules that determine whether parameters' changes
       require re-authorization are agreed out of band, based on a
       Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the domains of the NE and
       the AE.
   c.  The QAA message contains the authorized parameters of the flow
       and its QoS.  Any change or request for change of these
       parameters requires contacting the AE for re-authorization.
   d.  In addition to the authorized parameters of the flow and its QoS,
       the QAA message contains policy rules that determine the NEs
       actions in case of change or request for change in authorized
       parameters.

   Provided options are not exhaustive.  Elaborating on any of the
   listed approaches is deployment /solution specific and is not
   considered in the current document.

   In addition, the AE may use a RAR to perform re-authorization with
   the authorized parameters directly when the re-authorization is
   triggered by service request or local events/policy rules.

4.3.1.  Client-Side Initiated Re-Authorization

   The AE provides the duration of the authorization session as part of
   the QoS-Authorization-Answer message (QAA).  At any time before
   expiration of this period, a new QoS-Authorization-Request message
   (QAR) MAY be sent to the AE.  The transmission of the QAR MAY be

4.4.  Session Termination

4.4.1.  Client-Side Initiated Session Termination

   The authorization session for an installed QoS reservation state MAY
   be terminated by the Diameter client by sending a Session-
   Termination-Request message (STR) to the Diameter server.  This is a
   Diameter base protocol function and it is defined in [RFC3588].
   Session termination can be caused by a QoS signaling messaging
   requesting deletion of the existing QoS reservation state or it can
   be caused as a result of a soft-state expiration of the QoS
   reservation state.

5.  QoS Application Messages

   The Diameter QoS Application requires the definition of new mandatory
   AVPs and Command-codes (see Section 3 of [RFC3588]).  Four new
   Diameter messages are defined along with Command-Codes whose values
   MUST be supported by all Diameter implementations that conform to
   this specification.

         +---------------------+---------+--------+-------------+
         | Command Name        | Abbrev. |  Code  | Reference   |

   In addition, the following Diameter Base protocol messages are used
   in the Diameter QoS application:

          +-----------------------+---------+------+-----------+
          | Command-Name          | Abbrev. | Code | Reference |

          +-----------------------+---------+------+-----------+

                      Table 4: Diameter Base Commands

   Diameter nodes conforming to this specification MAY advertise support
   by including the value of [TBD5] in the Auth-Application-Id or the
   Acct-Application-Id AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and
   Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands, see [RFC3588].

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application           February 2008


   The value of {TBD5] MUST be used as the Application-Id in all QAR/QAA
   and QIR/QIA commands.

   The value of zero (0) SHOULD be used as the Application-Id in all
   STR/STA, ASR/ASA, and RAR/RAA commands, because these commands are
   defined in the Diameter base protocol and no additional mandatory
   AVPs for those commands are defined in this document.

5.1.  QoS-Authorization Request (QAR)

   The QoS-Authorization-Request message (QAR) indicated by the Command-
   Code field (see Section 3 of [RFC3588]) set to [TBD1] and 'R' bit set
   in the Command Flags field is used by NEs to request quality of
   service related resource authorization for a given flow.

   The QAR message MUST carry information for signaling session
   identification, AE identification, information about the requested
   QoS, and the identity of the QoS requesting entity.  In addition,
   depending on the deployment scenario, an authorization token and
   credentials of the QoS requesting entity SHOULD be included.

   The message format, presented in ABNF form [RFC4234], is defined as
   follows:


    <QoS-Request> ::= < Diameter Header: [TBD1], REQ, PXY >
                         < Session-Id >
                         { Auth-Application-Id }
                         { Origin-Host }
                         { Origin-Realm }
                         { Destination-Realm }
                         { Auth-Request-Type }
                         [ Destination-Host ]
                         [ User-Name ]
                      *  [ QoS-Resources ]
                         [ QoS-Authz-Data ]
                         [ Bound-Auth-Session-Id ]
                      *  [ AVP ]

5.2.  QoS-Authorization Answer (QAA)

   The QoS-Authorization-Answer message (QAA), indicated by the Command-
   Code field set to [TBD2] and 'R' bit cleared in the Command Flags
   field is sent in response to the QoS-Authorization-Request message
   (QAR).  If the QoS authorization request is successfully authorized,
   the response will include the AVPs to allow authorization of the QoS
   resources and transport plane gating information.

Internet-Draft          Diameter QoS Application           February 2008


   The message format is defined as follows:


    <QoS-Answer> ::= < Diameter Header: [TBD2], PXY >
                     < Session-Id >
                     { Auth-Application-Id }
                     { Auth-Request-Type }
                     { Result-Code }
                     { Origin-Host }
                     { Origin-Realm }
                  *  [ QoS-Resources ]
                     [ Acc-Multisession-Id ]
                     [ Session-Timeout ]
                     [ Authz-Session-Lifetime ]
                     [ Authz-Grace-Period ]
                  *  [ AVP ]

5.3.  QoS-Install Request (QIR)

   The QoS-Install Request message (QIR), indicated by the Command-Code
   field set to [TBD3] and 'R' bit set in the Command Flags field is
   used by AE to install or update the QoS parameters and the flow state
   of an authorized flow at the transport plane element.

   The message MUST carry information for signaling session
   identification or identification of the flow to which the provided
   QoS rules apply, identity of the transport plane element, description
   of provided QoS parameters, flow state and duration of the provided
   authorization.

   The message format is defined as follows:


    <QoS-Install-Request> ::= < Diameter Header: [TBD3], REQ, PXY >
                              < Session-Id >
                              { Auth-Application-Id }
                              { Origin-Host }
                              { Origin-Realm }
                              { Destination-Realm }
                              { Auth-Request-Type }
                              [ Destination-Host ]
                           *  [ QoS-Resources ]
                              [ Session-Timeout ]
                              [ Authz-Session-Lifetime ]
                              [ Authz-Grace-Period ]
                              [ Authz-Session-Volume ]
                           *  [ AVP ]

5.4.  QoS-Install Answer (QIA)

   The QoS-Install Answer message (QIA), indicated by the Command-Code
   field set to [TBD4] and 'R' bit cleared in the Command Flags field is
   sent in response to the QoS-Install Request message (QIR) for
   confirmation of the result of the installation of the provided QoS
   reservation instructions.

   The message format is defined as follows:


     <QoS-Install-Answer> ::= < Diameter Header: [TBD4], PXY >
                              < Session-Id >
                              { Auth-Application-Id }
                              { Origin-Host }
                              { Origin-Realm }
                              { Result-Code }
                           *  [ QoS-Resources ]
                           *  [ AVP ]

5.5.  Re-Auth-Request (RAR)

   The Re-Auth-Request message (RAR), indicated by the Command-Code
   field set to 258 and the 'R' bit set in the Command Flags field, is
   sent by the AE to the NE in order to initiate the QoS re-
   authorization from DQA server side.

   If the RAR command is received by the NE without any parameters of
   the re-authorized QoS state, the NE MUST initiate a QoS re-
   authorization by sending a QoS-Authorization-Request (QAR) message
   towards the AE.

   The message format is defined as follows:


    <Re-Auth-Request> ::= < Diameter Header: 258, REQ, PXY >
                              < Session-Id >
                              { Auth-Application-Id }
                              { Origin-Host }
                              { Origin-Realm }
                              { Destination-Realm }
                              { Auth-Request-Type }
                              [ Destination-Host ]
                           *  [ QoS-Resources ]
                              [ Session-Timeout ]
                              [ Authz-Session-Lifetime ]
                              [ Authz-Grace-Period ]

6.  QoS Application State Machine

   The QoS application reuses the authorization state machine defined in
   Section 8.1 of the Base Protocol ([RFC3588]) with its own messages as
   defined in Section 5 and QoS AVPs as defined in Section 7.

6.1.  Supplemented States for Push Mode

   In addition to the reused state machines, the following states are
   supplemented to first 2 state machines in which the session state is
   maintained on the Server, and MUST be supported in any QoS
   application implementations in support of server initiated push mode
   (see (Section 4.2.2)).

   The following states are supplemented to the state machine on the
   server when it is maintaining state for the session as defined in
   Section 8.1 of the Base Protocol [RFC3588]:

                                 SERVER, STATEFUL

7.2.  QoS Application Defined AVPs

   This document reuses the AVPs defined in Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-attributes].

   This section lists the AVPs that are introduced specifically for the
   QoS application.  The following new AVPs are defined: Bound-Auth-
   Session-Id and the QoS-Authz-Data AVP.

   The following table describes the Diameter AVPs newly defined in this
   document for usage with the QoS Application, their AVP code values,
   types, possible flag values, and whether the AVP may be encrypted.

   QoS-Authz-Data
      The QoS-Authz-Data AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString.  It
      is a container that carries application session or user specific
      data that has to be supplied to the AE as input to the computation
      of the authorization decision.

   Bound-Authentication-Session-Id
      The Bound-Authentication-Session AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type
      UTF8String.  It carries the id of the Diameter authentication
      session that is used for the network access authentication (NASREQ
      authentication session).  It is used to tie the QoS authorization
      request to a prior authentication of the end host done by a co-
      located application for network access authentication (Diameter
      NASREQ) at the QoS NE.

8.  Accounting

   A NE may start an accounting session by sending an Accounting-Request
   message (ACR) after successful QoS reservation and activation of the
   data flow (see Figure 6 and Figure 7).  After every successful re-
   authorization procedure (see Figure 8 and Figure 9), the NE may
   initiate an interim accounting message exchange.  After successful
   session termination (see Figure 10 and Figure 11), the NE may
   initiate a final exchange of accounting messages for terminating of
   the accounting session and reporting final records for the usage of
   the QoS resources reserved.  It should be noted that the two sessions
   (authorization and accounting) have independent management by the
   Diameter base protocol, which allows for finalizing the accounting
   session after the end of the authorization session.

   The detailed QoS accounting procedures are out of scope in this
   document.

9.1.  Example Call Flow for Pull Mode

   This section presents an example of the interaction between the end
   host and Diameter QoS application entities using Pull mode.  The
   application layer signaling is, in this example, provided using SIP.
   Signaling for a QoS resource reservation is done using the QoS NSLP.
   The authorization of the QoS reservation request is done by the
   Diameter QoS application (DQA).

   The communication starts with SIP signaling between the two end
   points and the SIP server for negotiation and authorization of the
   requested service and its parameters (see Figure 22).  As a part of
   the process, the SIP server verifies whether the user at Host A is
   authorized to use the requested service (and potentially the ability

   to be charged for the service usage).  Negotiated session parameters
   are provided to the end host.

   Subsequently, Host A initiates a QoS signaling message towards Host
   B. It sends a QoS NSLP Reserve message, in which it includes
   description of the required QoS (QSPEC object) and authorization data
   for negotiated service session (part of the POLICY_DATA object).
   Authorization data includes, as a minimum, the identity of the AE
   (e.g., the SIP server) and an identifier of the application service
   session for which QoS resources are requested.

   A QoS NSLP Reserve message is intercepted and processed by the first
   QoS aware Network Element.  The NE uses the Diameter QoS application
   to request authorization for the received QoS reservation request.
   The identity of the AE (in this case the SIP server that is co-
   located with a Diameter server) is put into the Destination-Host AVP,
   any additional session authorization data is encapsulated into the
   QoS-Authz-Data AVP and the description of the QoS resources is
   included into QoS-Resources AVP.  These AVPs are included into a QoS
   Authorization Request message, which is sent to the AE.

   A QAR message will be routed through the AAA network to the AE.  The
   AE verifies the requested QoS against the QoS resources negotiated
   for the service session and replies with QoS-Authorization answer
   (QAA) message.  It carries the authorization result (Result-Code AVP)
   and the description of the authorized QoS parameters (QoS-Resources
   AVP), as well as duration of the authorization session
   (Authorization-Lifetime AVP).

   The NE interacts with the traffic control function and installs the
   authorized QoS resources and forwards the QoS NSLP Reserve message
   further along the data path.  Moreover, the NE may serve as a
   signaling proxy and process the QoS signaling (e.g. initiation or
   termination of QoS signaling) based on the QoS decision received from
   the authorizing entity.

        .-.-.-.-.  SIP signaling
        - - - - -  Diameter QoS Application messages

             Figure 23: QoS Authorization Example - Push Mode

   The communication starts with SIP signaling between the two end
   points and the SIP server for negotiation and authorization of the
   requested service and its parameters (see Figure 23).  As a part of
   the process, the SIP server verifies whether the user at Host A is
   authorized to use the requested service (and potentially the ability
   to be charged for the service usage).  The DQA server is triggered to
   authorize the QoS request based on session parameters (i.e., SDP
   offer), initiate a Diameter QoS authorization session and install
   authorized QoS state to the Network Element via QIR message.

   The DQA server may obtain the info of peer DQA client from pre-
   configured information or query the DNS based on Host A's identity or
   IP address (In this case a DQA server is co-located with a SIP server
   and a DQA client is co-located with a NE).  The identity of Network
   Element is put into the Destination-Host AVP, the description of the
   QoS resources is included into QoS-Resources AVP, as well as duration
   of the authorization session (Authorization-Lifetime AVP).  The NE
   interacts with the traffic control function and reserves the
   authorized QoS resources accordingly, for instance, the NE may serve
   as a signaling proxy and process the QoS signaling (e.g. initiation
   or termination of QoS signaling) based on the QoS decision received
   from the authorizing entity.

   With successful QoS authorization, the SDP offer in SIP Invite is
   forwarded to Host B. Host B sends back a 18x (ringing) message
   towards Host A and processes the SDP.  Once Host B accepts the call,
   it sends back a 200 OK, in which it includes description of the
   accepted session parameters (i.e.  SDP answer).

   The DQA server may verify the accepted QoS against the pre-authorized
   QoS resources, and sends a Diameter RAR message to the DQA client in
   the NE for activating the installed policies and commit the resource
   allocation.  With successful QoS enforcement, the 200 OK is forwarded
   towards Host A.

   Note that the examples above show a sender-initiated reservation from
   the end host towards the corresponding node and a receiver-initiated
   reservation from the correspondent node towards the end host.

11.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a mechanism for performing authorization of a
   QoS reservation at a third party entity.  Therefore, the QoS
   signaling application carry sufficient information that the backend
   AAA server can make a authorization decision.  This functionality is
   particularly useful in roaming environments where the authorization
   decision is most likely provided at an entity where the user can be
   authenticated, such as in the home realm.

   QoS signaling application MAY re-use the authenticated identities
   used for the establishment of the secured transport channel for the
   signaling messages, e.g., TLS or IPsec between the end host and the
   policy aware QoS NE.  In addition, a collocation of the QoS NE with,
   for example, the Diameter NASREQ application (see [RFC4005]) may
   allow the QoS authorization to be based on the authenticated identity
   used during the network access authentication protocol run.  If a co-
   located deployment is not desired then special security protection is
   required to ensure that arbitrary nodes cannot reuse a previous
   authentication exchange to perform an authorization decision.

   Additionally, QoS authorization might be based on the usage of
   authorization tokens that are generated by the AE and provided to the
   end host via application layer signaling.

   The impact of the existence of different authorization models is
   (with respect to this Diameter QoS application) the ability to carry
   different authentication and authorization information.
