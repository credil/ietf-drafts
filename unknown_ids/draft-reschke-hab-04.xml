<section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
<t>
  This document contains test renditions for the changes specified
  in  <xref target="RFC5741"/>, as generated
  by an experimental version of rfc2629.xslt (see <eref target="http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/rfc2629xslt.html"/>).
  Its purpose is to illustrate the resulting text for all the variations of the
  various input parameters, and to track the changes applied to the proposal
  during the RFC-Editor's publication process.
</t>
<!--, plus additionally proposed changes that
  will not appear in RFC 5741, but might be used in practice in 2010-->
</section>  

<section title="Implementation Status for Xml2Rfc">
<t>
  Please join the xml2rfc mailing list (<eref target="http://lists.xml.resource.org/mailman/listinfo/xml2rfc"/>)
  for discussion of changes to the RFC 2629 vocabulary (<xref target="RFC2629"/>).
</t>

<section title="rfc2629.xslt (XML -&gt; XSLT -&gt; (X)HTML|XSL-FO)">
<t>
  The examples below were generated with an experimental version of rfc2629.xslt
  (see <eref target="http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/rfc2629xslt.html"/>).
</t>
</section>
<section title="xml2rfc.tcl (XML -&gt; TCL -&gt; TXT|HTML)">
<t>
  At the time of this writing, there was no work scheduled for updating xml2rfc,
  thus no direct conversion of XML source to TXT files is available
  (see <eref target="http://xml.resource.org"/>).
