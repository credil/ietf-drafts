Abstract

   This document specifies the usage of FMIPv6 when Proxy Mobile IPv6 is
   applied for the mobility management protocol.  Necessary amendments
   are shown for FMIPv6 to work under the condition that the mobile node
   does not have IP mobility functionality and it is not involved with
   either MIPv6 or FMIPv6 operations.

2.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [2] provides IP mobility to a mobile node that does
   not have Mobile IPv6 [4] functionality.  The proxy agent in the
   network performs the signaling and does the mobility management on
   behalf of the mobile node.  Although the signaling between the mobile
   node and the network can be saved, the basic performance for handover
   such as handover latency is considered to be not different from that
   of Mobile IPv6.

   To improve handover latency due to Mobile IPv6 procedures, fast
   handovers for MIPv6 is specified in FMIPv6[3].  By applying the
   FMIPv6 solution to Proxy MIPv6 as well, it is expected that the
   handover latency due to Proxy MIPv6 procedures will be improved as
   much.  However, Mobile IPv6 and Proxy MIPv6 are intrinsically
   different in the sense that the mobile node is not involved with IP
   mobility and hence does not directly handle the care-of address.
   Hence, there are some issues in directly applying the original
   specifications of FMIPv6 to Proxy MIPv6.  This document identifies
   those differences and specifies amendments to apply FMIPv6 solution
   principles to Proxy MIPv6.

3.  Terminology

   This document refers to [2][3][4] for terminology.  The following
   terms and abbreviations are additionally used in this document.  The
   reference network is illustrated in Figure 1.

   Previous Access Network (P-AN):
        The access network to which the MN is attached before handover.

   New Access Network (N-AN):
        The access network to which the MN is attached after handover.

   Previous Mobile Access Gateway (PMAG):
        The MAG that manages mobility related signaling for the MN
        before handover.  In this document, the MAG and the Access
        Router (AR) are collocated.

   New Mobile Access Gateway (NMAG):
        The MAG that manages mobility related signaling for the MN after
        handover.

   HO-Initiate:
        A generic signaling that indicates the handover of the MN sent
        from the P-AN to the PMAG.  While this signaling is dependent on
        the access technology, it is assumed that HO-Initiate can carry
        the information to specify the MN and to help the PAR resolve
        the NAR (e.g. the new access point or base station to which the
        MN is moving to).

4.  Proxy-based FMIPv6 Protocol Overview

   To reduce the handover latency due to signaling between the MAGs
   (Mobile Access Gateways) and the LMA (Local Mobility Anchor), FMIPv6
   in this document specifies a bi-directional tunnel between the
   Previous MAG (PMAG) and the New MAG (NMAG).  To expedite sending the
   Proxy Binding Update (PBU) by the NMAG, FMIPv6 protocol is also used
   for context transfer, whereby the necessary information for sending
   the PBU is transferred from the PMAG.

   In this document, the Previous Access Router (PAR) and New Access
   Router (NAR) are interchangeable with the PMAG and NMAG,
   respectively.

   Since the MN is not directly involved with IP mobility, it is natural
   to think that the MN is not directly involved with fast handover
   procedures, either at least from the IP layer perspective.
   Therefore, among the messages for fast handovers defined in RFC4068,
   those that are initiated by and targeted to the MN are not used when
   PMIPv6 is in use.  Such messages are the Router Solicitation for
   Proxy Advertisement (RtSolPr), Proxy Router Advertisement (PrRtAdv),
   Fast Binding Update (FBU), Fast Binding Acknowledgment (FBack) and
   Fast Neighbor Advertisement (FNA).

4.1.  Protocol Operation

   RFC4068 specifies two types of fast handovers; the predictive fast
   handover and the reactive fast handover.  In the predictive fast
   handover, the MN sends the FBU to the PAR before handover, which then
   triggers to establish a bi-directional tunnel between the PAR and NAR
   to transfer packets for the MN.  On the other hand, in the reactive
   fast handover, the FBU is sent by the MN to the NAR after it has
   moved to the new network, which is then transferred to the PAR to
   trigger to send the Handover Initiate (HI) towards the NAR.  Based on
   the above observations, the fast handover procedures for PMIPv6 need
   to work without the involvement of the MN.  Figure 2 illustrates the
   predictive fast handover procedures for PMIPv6, where the bi-
   directional tunnel establishment is initiated by the PAR.

       Figure 2: Predictive fast handover for PMIPv6 (PAR initiated)

   The detailed descriptions are as follows:

   (a)  The MN detects that a handover is imminent and reports the
      identifications of itself (MN ID) and the access point (New AP ID)
      to which the MN is most likely to move.  These IDs can be Link-
      Layer Addresses (LLAs) or any other types of IDs.  This step is
      access technology specific.  In some cases, the P-AN will figure
      out which AP ID the MN is moving to.

Internet-Draft          Proxy-based Fast Handover          November 2007


   (b)  The previous access network (P-AN), to which the MN is currently
      attached, indicates the handover of the MN to the PAR (PMAG).

   (c)  The PAR sends the HI to the NAR.  The HI message MUST include
      the MN ID and SHOULD include the MN-HoA, the MN-IID and the
      address of the LMA that is currently serving the MN.

   (d)  The NAR sends back the Hack to the PAR.  At this point, the bi-
      directional tunnel between the PAR and NAR is established.

   (e)  Packets destined for the MN are transferred from the PAR to the
      NAR over the tunnel that is established at the previous step.
      After detunneling, those packets may be buffered at the NAR based
      on the U flag in the HI message.  If the connection between the
      N-AN and NAR has already been established, those packet may reach
      the N-AN (access technology specific).

   (f)  The MN hands over to the New Access Network (N-AN).

   (g)  The MN establishes a connection (e.g. radio channel) with the
      N-AN, which in turn triggers the establishment of the connection
      between the N-AN and NAR if it has not been established, yet
      (access technology specific).  This can be regarded as a
      substitute for the FNA.

   (h)  The NAR starts to transfer packets destined for the MN via the
      N-AN.

   (i)  The uplink packets from the MN are sent to the NAR via the N-AN
      and the NAR forwards them to the PAR.  The PAR then sends the
      packets to the LMA that is currently serving the MN.

   (j)  The NAR (NMAG) sends the Proxy Binding Update (PBU) to the LMA,
      whose address can be obtained in (c).  Steps (j) and (k) are not
      part of the fast handover procedure, but shown for reference.

   (k)  The LMA sends back the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment (PBA) to the
      NAR (NMAG).  From this time on, the packets to/from the MN go
      through the NAR instead of the PAR.

   According to Section 4 of RFC4068, the PAR establishes a binding
   between the PCoA and NCoA to forward packets for the MN to the NAR,
   and the NAR creates a proxy NCE to receive those packets for the NCoA
   before the MN arrives.  In the case of PMIPv6, however, the only
   address that is used by the MN is MN-HoA, so the PAR transfers the
   packets for the MN to the NAR instead of the NCoA.  The NAR then
   simply detunnels (decapsulates) those packets and delivers them to
   the MN.  If the NAR obtains the LLA (=MN ID) and MN-HoA by the HI, it

   can create the NCE for the MN and deliver packets to it before the MN
   performs the ND.  For the uplink packets from the MN after handover
   in (i), the NAR forwards the packets to the PAR through the tunnel
   established in step (d).  The PAR then decapsulates and sends them to
   the LMA.

   The IP addresses in the headers of those user packets are summarized
   below:

   If the network that the MN has moved in does not support PMIPv6 but
   only MIPv6 (i.e. there exists a MIPv6 HA) and the MN supports MIPv6
   at the same time, the MN and HA can exchange BU/BA instead of PBU/PBA
   in steps (j) and (k).  If this is the case, the LMA and HA will most
   likely be collocated and the LMA (HA) address should be maintained in
   the new network for communication continuity.  Since the LMA (HA)
   address is transferred to the NAR in step (c), the MN can retrieve it
   at or after step (g) by e.g. the authentication or DHCP procedure
   (not shown in the figure).

   In the case of the reactive handover for PMIPv6, since the MN does
   not send either the FBU or FNA, it would be more natural that the NAR
   sends the HI to the PAR after the MN has moved to the new network.
   Figure 3 illustrates the reactive fast handover procedures for
   PMIPv6, where the bi-directional tunnel establishment is initiated by
   the NAR.

        Figure 3: Reactive fast handover for PMIPv6 (NAR initiated)

   The detailed descriptions are as follows:

   (a)  The MN hands over from the P-AN to the N-AN.

   (b)  The MN establishes a connection (e.g. radio channel) with the
        N-AN, which triggers the establishment of the connection between
        the N-AN and NAR.  The MN ID is transferred to the NAR for the
        subsequent procedures.  This can be regarded as a substitute for
        the FNA and FBU.

   (c)  The NAR sends the HI to the PAR.  The HI message MUST include
        the MN ID.  The Context Request Option MAY be included to
        request additional context information on the MN to the PAR.

Internet-Draft          Proxy-based Fast Handover          November 2007


   (d)  The PAR sends back the HAck to the NAR.  The HAck message MUST
        include the MN-HoA that is corresponding to the MN ID in the HI
        message and SHOULD include the MN-IID and the LMA address that
        is currently serving the MN.  The context information requested
        by the NAR MUST be included.  At this point, the bi-directional
        tunnel between the PAR and NAR is established.

   (e)  Packets destined for the MN are transferred from the PAR to the
        NAR over the tunnel that is established at the previous step.
        After detunneling, those packets are delivered to the MN via the
        N-AN.

   (f)  The uplink packets from the MN are sent to the NAR via the N-AN
        and the NAR forwards them to the PAR.  The PAR then sends the
        packets to the LMA that is currently serving the MN.

   Steps (g)-(h) are the same as (j)-(k) in the predictive fast handover
   procedures.

   In step (c), The IP address of the PAR needs to be resolved by the
   NAR to send the HI to the PAR.  This information may come from the
   N-AN or some database that the NAR can access.

   Also, in step (c), the NAR could send an unsolicited HAck message to
   the PAR, which then triggers the HI message from the PAR.  By doing
   so, the directions of HI/HAck messages are aligned with the
   predictive (PAR-initiated) fast handover.  Further study is needed if
   this call flow is more appropriate than the current one.

4.2.  Handoff Type Considerations

   PMIPv6 [2] defines the Handoff Indicator flag in the Access
   Technology Type option and describes the type of the handoff and the
   values to set to the flag.  This document proposes one approach to
   determining the handoff type.

   According to [2], four handoff types are defined:

      1) Attachment over a new interface (HI=1)

      2) Handoff between interfaces (HI=2)

      3) Handoff between on the same interface (HI=3)

      4) Handoff state unknown (HI=4)

   By using the MN Interface Identification (MN IID) option, which is
   defined in this document, the following solution can be considered.



Yokota, et al.            Expires May 22, 2008                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          Proxy-based Fast Handover          November 2007


   When the NMAG receives the MN IID used in the P-AN from the PMAG via
   the HI or HAck messages, the NMAG compares it with the new MN IID
   that is obtained from the MN in the N-AN.  If these two MN IIDs are
   the same, the handover type falls into 3) and the Handoff Indicator
   flag in the Access Technology Type option is set to 3.  If these two
   MN IIDs are different, the handover is likely to be 2) since the HI/
   HAck message exchange implies that this is a handover not a multi-
   homing, therefore the Handoff Indicator flag can be set to 2.  If
   there is no HI/Hack exchange performed prior to the network
   attachment of the MN in the new network, the NMAG may infer that this
   is a multi-homing case and set the Handoff Indicator flag to 1.  If
   none of them can be assumed, the NMAG may set the flag to 4.
