Abstract

   This document defines a DHCPv6 option to help configure a multi-homed
   host's routing table with new entries when the host attaches to a new
   network on a new interface.

Internet-Draft               DHCPv6 Solution                  March 2009


1.  Introduction

   Traditional routing considered only the destination address in
   IPv4/v6 header.  Policy routing on the hand considers all of the
   fields in the header sometimes even the payload.  In IPv6, the hosts
   receive router advertisements containing information useful for
   policy routing.  However in some networks, e.g. cellular networks,
   DHCP servers can be used to help multi-homed mobile nodes configure
   their routing tables.

   Using a single default route would lead to routing of all flows
   through a single interface.  Such a configuration makes it impossible
   to use multiple interfaces simultaneously if the host is multi-homed.

   Requirements of supporting multiple interfaces in hosts without
   involving mobility protocols are discussed in [I-D.yang-mif-req].
   DHCP is identified as a protocol to communicate interface management
   policies between MIF nodes and the network.

   The IPv6 hosts receive router advertisements and then populate their
   Default Router List and Prefix List based on information in the
   router advertisements (RA) [RFC2461].  [RFC4191] extended RAs with
   Route Information Option and added Default Router Preference.  Such
   RAs if available would help multi-homed mobile nodes configure better
   to enable the simultanenous use of all interfaces.

   In this document we define a new DHCPv6 option.  This option is to
   inform multi-homed hosts about the routes and other useful
   information available on the new network that the host has just
   connected.  It is appropriate to use DHCP for this purpose because
   DHCP is already needed for initial configuration of the host's
   interface, e.g. for address assignment.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC3315], [RFC3633].


3.  Configuring Routing Tables of Multi-homed Hosts

   IPv6 routing table contains these entries: prefix, prefix length,
   preference value, lifetime, and the address of the next-hop router.

   Multi-homed hosts receive configuration information on each
   interface.  Routers send router advertisements.  DHCP servers provide
   host configuration information.  SDOs are defining servers such as
   Access Network Discovery and Selection function (ANDSF).  ANDSF can

   also provide node configuration information on SDO interfaces.
   Configuration information helps host set up and update important
   databases that the host uses such as the routing table.

   Since IPv6 allows multiple unicast addresses to be assigned to
   interfaces, IPv6 hosts face the problem of default source and
   destination address selection when initiating communication.
   [RFC3484] defined algorithms for this purpose.

   In this document we extend DHCPv6 with an option called multi-homed
   routing policy entry option.  Using this option DHCPv6 server can
   inform DHCPv6 client on the default routes available on the interface
   which the host is about to connect.  The option also allows DHCP
   server to provide more information on the flows such as the traffic
   classes.  The host receives the route information ordered with
   priority which allows the host to select the right interface to start
   communication.


4.  DHCPv6 Option

   A new option is defined to carry the host routing information.  It is
   shown in Figure 1.

   DHCP server MAY send a Reply message containing multi-homed routing
   policy entry option.  DHCP client MUST add an entry to its routing
   table based on this option.  DHCP client MAY modify other tables such
   as Default Router List or Pref List [RFC4191].

   DHCP Client MAY include multi-homed routing policy entry option in
   Option Request Option [RFC3315] in DHCP Request message.  DHCP Server
   MUST include multi-homed routing policy entry option in the
   corresponding Reply message.
