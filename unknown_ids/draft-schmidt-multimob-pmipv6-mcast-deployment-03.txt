 A Minimal Deployment Option for Multicast Listeners in PMIPv6 Domains
           draft-schmidt-multimob-pmipv6-mcast-deployment-03

Abstract

   This document describes deployment options for activating multicast
   listener functions in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains without modifying
   mobility and multicast protocol standards.  Similar to Home Agents in
   Mobile IPv6, PMIPv6 Local Mobility Anchors serve as multicast
   subscription anchor points, while Mobile Access Gateways provide MLD
   proxy functions.  In this scenario, Mobile Nodes remain agnostic of
   multicast mobility operations.

1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] extends Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] by
   network-based management functions that enable IP mobility for a host
   without requiring its participation in any mobility-related
   signaling.  Additional network entities, i.e., the Local Mobility
   Anchor (LMA), and Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs), are responsible for
   managing IP mobility on behalf of the mobile node (MN).

   With these routing entities in place, the mobile node looses
   transparent end-to-end connectivity to the static Internet, and in
   the particular case of multicast communication, group membership
   management as signaled by the Multicast Listener Discovery protocol
   [RFC3810], [RFC2710] requires a dedicated treatment at the network
   side, see [I-D.deng-multimob-pmip6-requirement].

   Multicast routing functions need a careful placement within the
   PMIPv6 domain to augment unicast transmission with group
   communication services.  [RFC5213] does not explicitly address
   multicast communication, whereas bi-directional home tunneling, the
   minimal multicast support arranged by MIPv6, cannot be applied in
   network-based management scenarios: A mobility-unaware node will
   experience no reason to initiate a tunnel with an entity of mobility
   support.

   This document describes options for deploying multicast listener
   functions in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains without modifying mobility and
   multicast protocol standards.  Similar to Home Agents in Mobile IPv6,
   PMIPv6 Local Mobility Anchors serve as multicast subscription anchor
   points, while Mobile Access Gateways provide MLD proxy functions.
   Mobile Nodes in this scenario remain agnostic of multicast mobility
   operations.  Accrediting the problem space of multicast mobility
   [I-D.irtf-mobopts-mmcastv6-ps], this document does not address
   specific optimizations and efficiency improvements of multicast
   routing in network-centered mobility beyond base potentials, as such
   solutions would require changes to the base specification of
   [RFC5213].


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology as defined for the mobility
   protocols [RFC3775] and [RFC5213], as well as the multicast edge
   related protocols [RFC3810] and [RFC4605].

   An MN in a PMIPv6 domain will decide on multicast group membership
   management completely independent of its current mobility conditions.
   It will submit MLD Report and Done messages following application
   desires, thereby using its link-local source address and multicast
   destination addresses according to [RFC3810], or [RFC2710].  These
   link-local signaling messages will arrive at the currently active MAG
   via one of its downstream local (wireless) links.  A multicast
   unaware MAG would simply discard these MLD messages.

   To facilitate multicast in a PMIPv6 domain, an MLD proxy function



Schmidt, et al.           Expires June 19, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        Multicast Listeners in PMIPv6        December 2009


   [RFC4605] needs to be deployed on the MAG that selects the tunnel
   interface corresponding to the MN's LMA for its upstream interface
   (cf., section 6 of [RFC5213]).  Thereby, each LMA-to-MAG tunnel
   interface defines an MLD proxy domain at the MAG, containing all
   downstream links to MNs that share this LMA.  According to standard
   proxy operations, MLD Report messages will be forwarded under
   aggregation up the tunnel interface to its corresponding LMA.

   Serving as the designated multicast router or an additional MLD
   proxy, the LMA will transpose any MLD message from a MAG into the
   multicast routing infrastructure.  Correspondingly, the LMA will
   implement appropriate multicast forwarding states at its tunnel
   interface.  Traffic arriving for groups under subscription will
   arrive at the LMA, which it will forward according to all its group/
   source states.  In addition, the LMA will naturally act as an MLD
   querier, seeing its downstream tunnel interfaces as multicast enabled
   links.

   At the MAG, MLD queries and multicast data will arrive on the
   (tunnel) interface that is assigned to a group of access links as
   identified by its Binding Update List (cf., section 6 of [RFC5213]).
   As specified for MLD proxies, the MAG will forward multicast traffic
   and initiate related signaling down the appropriate access links to
   the MNs.  In proceeding this way, all multicast-related signaling and
   the data traffic will transparently flow from the LMA to the MN on an
   LMA-specific tree, which is shared among the multicast sources.

   In case of a mobility handover, the MN (unaware of IP mobility) will
   refrain from submitting unsolicited MLD reports.  Instead, the MAG is
   required to maintain group memberships in the following way.  On
   observing a new MN on a downstream link, the MAG sends a General MLD
   Query.  Based on its outcome and the multicast group states
   previously maintained at the MAG, a corresponding Report will be sent
   to the LMA aggregating group states according to the proxy function.
   Additional Reports can be omitted, whenever multicast forwarding
   states previously established at the new MAG already cover the
   subscriptions of the MN.

   After Re-Binding, the LMA is not required to issue a General MLD
   Query on the tunnel link to refresh forwarding states.  Multicast
   state updates SHOULD be triggered by the MAG, which aggregates
   subscriptions of all its MNs (see the call flow in Figure 2).

   These multicast deployment considerations likewise apply for mobile
   nodes that operate with its IPv4 stack enabled in a PMIPv6 domain.
   PMIPv6 can provide an IPv4 home address mobility support
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].  Such mobile node will use
   IGMPv3 [RFC3376] signaling for multicast, which is handled by an IGMP
   proxy function at the MAG in an analogous way.

   Following these deployment steps, multicast management transparently
   interoperates with PMIPv6.  It is worth noting that multicast streams



Schmidt, et al.           Expires June 19, 2010                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Multicast Listeners in PMIPv6        December 2009


   can possibly be distributed on redundant paths that lead to duplicate
   traffic arriving from different LMAs at one MAG, and can cause
   multiple data transmissions from an MAG over one wireless domain to
   different MNs (see Appendix B for further considerations).


4.  Deployment Details

   Multicast activation in a PMIPv6 domain requires to deploy general
   multicast functions at PMIPv6 routers and to define its interaction
   with the PMIPv6 protocol in the following way:

4.1.  Operations of the Mobile Node

   A Mobile Node willing to manage multicast traffic will join, maintain
   and leave groups as if located in the fixed Internet.  No specific
   mobility actions nor implementations are required at the MN.

4.2.  Operations of the Mobile Access Gateway

   A Mobility Access Gateway is required to assist in MLD signaling and
   data forwarding between the MNs which it serves, and the
   corresponding LMAs associated to each MN.  It therefore needs to
   implement an instance of the MLD proxy function [RFC4605] for each
   upstream tunnel interface that has been established with an LMA.  The
   MAG decides on the mapping of downstream links to a proxy instance
   (and hence an upstream link to an LMA) based on the regular Binding
   Update List as maintained by PMIPv6 standard operations (cf., section
   6.1 of [RFC5213]).

   On the reception of MLD reports from an MN, the MAG MUST identify the
   corresponding proxy instance from the incoming interface and perform
   regular MLD proxy operations: it will insert/update/remove a
   multicast forwarding state on the incoming interface, and state
   updates will be merged into the MLD proxy membership database.  An
   aggregated Report will be sent to the upstream tunnel of the MAG when
   the membership database (cf., section 4.1 of [RFC4605]) changes.
   Conversely, on the reception of MLD Queries, the MAG proxy instance
   will answer the Queries on behalf of all active downstream receivers
   maintained in its membership database.  Queries sent by the LMA do
   not force the MAG to trigger corresponding messages immediately
   towards MNs.  Multicast traffic arriving at the MAG on an upstream
   interface will be forwarded according to the group/source-specific
   forwarding states as acquired for each downstream interface within
   the MLD proxy instance.

   In case of a mobility handover, the MAG will continue to manage
   upstream tunnels and downstream interfaces as foreseen in the PMIPv6

   specification.  However, it MUST assure consistency of its up- and
   downstream interfaces that change under mobility with MLD proxy
   instances and its multicast forwarding states.  The MAG will detect
   the arrival of a new MN by receiving a router solicitation message
   and by an upcoming link.  To learn about multicast groups subscribed
   by a newly attaching MN, the MAG sends a General Query to the MN's
   link.  Querying an upcoming interface is a standard operation of MLD
   queriers (see Appendix A).  In case, the access link between MN and
   MAG goes down, interface-specific multicast states change.  Both
   cases may alter the composition of the membership database, which
   then will trigger corresponding Reports towards the LMA.  Note that
   the actual observable state depends on the access link model in use.

   An MN may be unable to answer MAG multicast membership queries due to
   handover procedures.  Such occurrence is equivalent to a General
   Query loss.  To prevent erroneous query timeouts at the MAG, MLD
   parameters SHOULD be carefully adjusted to the mobility regime.  In
   particular, MLD timers and the Robustness Variable (see section 9 of
   [RFC3810]) MUST be chosen to be compliant with the time scale of
   handover operations in the PMIPv6 domain.

   In proceeding this way, the MAG is entitled to aggregate multicast
   subscriptions for each of its MLD proxy instances.  However, this
   deployment approach does not prevent multiple identical streams
   arriving from different LMA upstream interfaces.  Furthermore, a per
   group forwarding into the wireless domain is restricted to the link
   model in use.

4.3.  Operations of the Local Mobility Anchor

   For any MN, the Local Mobility Anchor acts as the persistent Home
   Agent and at the same time as the default multicast querier for the
   corresponding MAG.  It implements the function of the designated
   multicast router or a further MLD proxy.  According to MLD reports
   received from a MAG (on behalf of the MNs), it establishes/maintains/
   removes group/source-specific multicast forwarding states at its
   corresponding downstream tunnel interfaces.  At the same time, it
   procures for aggregated multicast membership maintenance at its
   upstream interface.  Based on the multicast-transparent operations of
   the MAGs, the LMA experiences its tunnel interfaces as multicast
   enabled downstream links, serving zero to many listening nodes.
   Multicast traffic arriving at the LMA is transparently forwarded
   according to its multicast forwarding information base.

   On the occurrence of a mobility handover, the LMA will receive
   Binding Lifetime De-Registrations and Binding Lifetime Extensions
   that will cause a re-mapping of home network prefixes to Proxy-CoAs
   in its Binding Cache (see section 5.3 of [RFC5213]).  The multicast

   forwarding states require updating, as well, if the MN within an MLD
   proxy domain is the only receiver of a multicast group.  Two cases
   need distinction:

   1.  The mobile node is the only receiver of a group behind the
       interface at which a De-Registration was received: The membership
       database of the MAG changes, which will trigger a Report/Done
       sent via the MAG-to-LMA interface to remove this group.  The LMA
       thus terminates multicast forwarding.

   2.  The mobile node is the only receiver of a group behind the
       interface at which a Lifetime Extension was received: The
       membership database of the MAG changes, which will trigger a
       Report sent via the MAG-to-LMA interface to add this group.  The
       LMA thus starts multicast distribution.

   In proceeding this way, each LMA will provide transparent multicast
   support for the group of MNs it serves.  It will perform traffic
   aggregation at the MN-group level and will assure that multicast data
   streams are uniquely forwarded per individual LMA-to-MAG tunnel.

4.4.  IPv4 Support

   An MN in a PMIPv6 domain may use an IPv4 address transparently for
   communication as specified in [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].
   For this purpose, LMAs can register IPv4-Proxy-CoAs in its Binding
   Caches and MAGs can provide IPv4 support in access networks.
   Correspondingly, multicast membership management will be performed by
   the MN using IGMP.  For multicast support on the network side, an
   IGMP proxy function needs to be deployed at MAGs in exactly the same
   way as for IPv6.  [RFC4605] defines IGMP proxy behaviour in full
   agreement with IPv6/MLD.  Thus IPv4 support can be transparently
   provided following the obvious deployment analogy.

   For a dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 access network, it should be noted that
   the infrastructure cannot identify two data streams as identical when
   distributed via an IPv4 and IPv6 multicast group.  Thus duplicate
   data may be forwarded on a heterogeneous network layer.

4.5.  A Note on Explicit Tracking

   IGMPv3/MLDv2 [RFC3376], [RFC3810] may operate in combination with
   explicit tracking, which allows routers to monitor each multicast
   receiver.  This mechanism is not standardized yet, but widely
   implemented by vendors as it supports faster leave latencies and
   reduced signaling.

   Enabling explicit tracking on downstream interfaces of the LMA and

   MAG would track a single MAG and MN respectively per interface.  It
   may be used to preserve bandwidth on the MAG-MN link.

Appendix A.  Initial MLD Queries on Upcoming Links

   According to [RFC3810] and [RFC2710] when an IGMP/MLD-enabled router
   starts operating on a subnet, by default it considers itself as being
   the Querier and sends several General Queries.  Such initial query
   should be sent by the router immediately, but could be delayed by a
   (tunable) Startup Query Interval (see Sections 7.6.2. and 9.6. of
   [RFC3810]).

   Experimental tests on Linux and Cisco systems have revealed immediate
   IGMP Queries following a link trigger event (within a fraction of 1
   ms), while MLD Queries immediately followed the autoconfiguration of
   IPv6 link-local addresses at the corresponding interface.


Appendix B.  Comparative Evaluation of Different Approaches

   In this section, we briefly evaluate two basic PMIP concepts for
   multicast traffic organization at LMAs: In scenario A, multicast is
   provided by combined unicast/multicast LMAs as described in this
   document.  Scenario B directs traffic via a dedicated multicast LMA
   as proposed in [I-D.zuniga-multimob-smspmip], for example.

   Both approaches do not establish native multicast distribution
   between the LMA and MAG, but use tunneling mechanisms.  In scenario
   A, a MAG is connected to different multicast-enabled LMAs, and can
   receive the same multicast stream via multiple paths depending on the
   group subscriptions of MNs and their associated LMAs.  This problem,
   a.k.a. tunnel convergence problem, may lead to redundant traffic at
   the MAGs.  Scenario B in contrast configures MAGs to establish a
   tunnel to a single, dedicated multicast LMA for all attached MNs and
   relocates overhead costs to the multicast anchor.  This eliminates



Schmidt, et al.           Expires June 19, 2010                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        Multicast Listeners in PMIPv6        December 2009


   redundant traffic, but may result in an avalanche problem at the LMA.

   We quantify the costs of both approaches based on two metrics: The
   amount of redundant traffic at MAGs and the number of simultaneous
   streams at LMAs.  Realistic values depend on the topology and the
   group subscription model.  To explore scalability in a large PMIP
   domain of 1,000,000 MNs, we consider the following two extremal
   multicast settings.

   1.  All MNs participate in distinct multicast groups.

   2.  All MNs join the same multicast groups.

   A typical PMIP deployment approximately allows for 5,000 MNs attached
   to one MAG, while 50 MAGs can be served by one LMA.  Hence 1,000,000
   MNs require approx. 200 MAGs backed by 4 LMAs for unicast
   transmission.  In scenario A, these LMAs also forward multicast
   streams, while in scenario B one additional dedicated LMA (LMA-M)
   serves multicast.  In the following, we calculate the metrics
   described above.

   Setting 1:
         +===================+================+===================+
         | PMIP multicast    | # of redundant | # of sim. streams |
         | scheme            | streams at MAG | at LMA / LMA-M    |
         +===================+================+===================+
         | Combined Unicast/ |          0     |      250,000      |
         | Multicast LMA     |                |                   |
         +-------------------+----------------+-------------------+
         | Dedicated         |          0     |    1,000,000      |
         | Multicast LMA     |                |                   |
         +-------------------+----------------+-------------------+

         1,000,000 MNs are subscribed to distinct multicast groups

   Setting 2:
         +===================+================+===================+
         | PMIP multicast    | # of redundant | # of sim. streams |
         | scheme            | streams at MAG | at LMA / LMA-M    |
         +===================+================+===================+
         | Combined Unicast/ |          4     |           50      |
         | Multicast LMA     |                |                   |
         +-------------------+----------------+-------------------+
         | Dedicated         |          0     |          200      |
         | Multicast LMA     |                |                   |
         +-------------------+----------------+-------------------+

         1,000,000 MNs are subscribed to the same multicast group

   These considerations of extremal settings show that tunnel
   convergence, i.e., duplicate data arriving at a MAG, does cause much
   smaller problems in scalability than the stream replication at LMAs.
   For scenario A it should be also noted that the high stream
   replication requirements at LMAs in setting 1 can be attenuated by
   deploying additional LMAs in a PMIP domain, while scenario B does not
   allow for distributing the LMA-M, as no handover management is
   available at LMA-M.
