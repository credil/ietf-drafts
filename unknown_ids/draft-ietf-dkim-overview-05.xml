         <t> DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) associates a "responsible"
            identity with a message and provides a means of verifying that the
            association is legitimate. <xref target="RFC4871" />
            DKIM defines a domain-level authentication framework for email
            using public-key cryptography and key server technology. This
            permits verifying the source or intermediary for a message, as
            well as the contents of messages. The ultimate goal of this
            framework is to permit a signing domain to assert responsibility
            for a message, thus proving and protecting the identity associated
            with the message and the integrity of the messages itself, while
            retaining the functionality of Internet email as it is known
            today. Such protection of email identity may assist in the global
            control of "spam" and "phishing". This document provides an
            overview of DKIM, describes how it can fit into a messaging
            service, describes how it relates to other IETF message signature
            technologies, and includes implementation and migration
            considerations. </t>

            <t> DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) associates a "responsible"
               identity with a message and provides a means of verifying that
               the association is legitimate. <xref target="RFC4871" />
	       DKIM accomplishes this by defining a domain-level
               authentication framework for email using public-key
               cryptography and key server technology. This permits verifying
               the source or intermediary for a message, as well as the
               contents of messages. DKIM will also provide a mechanism that
               permits potential email signers to publish information about
               their email signing practices; this will permit email receivers
               to make additional assessments of unsigned messages.</t>
            <t>The ultimate goal of this framework is to permit a domain to
               assert responsibility for a message, thus proving and
               protecting the identity associated with the message and the
               integrity of the messages itself, while retaining the
               functionality of Internet email as it is known today. Such
               protection of email identity, may assist in the global control
               of "spam" and "phishing". </t>

            <t> This document provides a description of DKIM's architecture,
               functionality, deployment and use. It is intended for those who
               are adopting, developing, or deploying DKIM. It also will be
               helpful for those who are considering extending DKIM, either
               into other areas of use or to support additional features. This
               Overview does not provide information on threats to DKIM or
               email, or details on the protocol specifics, which can be found
               in <xref target="RFC4871" /> and <xref
                  target="RFC4686" />, respectively. The document assumes a
               background in basic network security technology and services. </t>

            <t> It must be stressed that neither this document nor DKIM
               attempt to provide solutions to the world's problems with spam,
               phish, virii, worms, joe jobs, etc. DKIM provides one basic
               tool, in what needs to be a large arsenal, for improving the
               safety of Internet mail. However, by itself, DKIM is not
               sufficient to that task and this overview does not pursue the
               issues of integrating DKIM into these larger efforts. Rather,
               it is a basic introduction to the technology and its
               deployment. </t>
            <section title="The DKIM Value Proposition">

               <t>The nature and origins of a message are often falsely
                  stated. As a foundation for distinguishing legitimate mail,
                  DKIM provides a means of associating a verifiable identity
                  with a message. Given the presence of that identity, a
                  receiver can make decisions about further handling of the
                  message, based upon assessments of that identity.</t>

               <t>Receivers who successfully verify a signature can use
                  information about the signer as part of a program to limit
                  spam, spoofing, phishing, or other undesirable behavior.
                  DKIM does not, itself, prescribe any specific actions by the
                  recipient; rather it is an enabling technology for services
                  that do. </t>

               <t>These services will typically: <list style="numbers">
                     <t>Verify an identity</t>
                     <t>Determine whether the identity is known or unknown</t>
                     <t>Determine whether a known identity is trusted</t>
                  </list>
               </t>

               <t>An attack is made against an organization or against
                  customers of an organization. The name of the organization
                  is linked to particular Internet domain names. One point of
                  leverage used by attackers is either to spoof a legitimate
                  domain name, or to use a "cousin" name that is similar to
                  one that is legitimate, but is not controlled by the target
                  organization. A DKIM-based accreditation service can enforce
                  a basic separation between domains used by such known
                  organizations and domains used by others.</t>

               <t>DKIM signatures can be created by a direct handler of a
                  message, either as its originator or as an intermediary. It
                  can also be created by an independent service, providing
                  assistance to a handler of the message. Whoever does the
                  signing chooses the domain name to be used as the basis for
                  later assessments. Hence, reputation associated with that
                  domain name is the basis for evaluating whether to trust the
                  message for delivery. The owner of the domain name being
                  used for a DKIM signature is declaring that they are
                  accountable for the message. </t>

               <t>DKIM is intended to be a value-added feature for email. Mail
                  that is not signed by email is handled in the same way as it
                  now is; it continues to be evaluated by established analysis
                  and filtering techniques. Over time, widespread DKIM
                  adoption could permit degraded handling of messages that are
                  not signed. However early benefits do not require this
                  more-stringent enforcement.</t>

               <t>It is important to be clear about the narrow scope of DKIM's
                  capabilities. It is an enabling technology, intended for use
                  in the larger context of determining message legitimacy.
                  This larger context is complex, so that it is easy to assume
                  that a component like DKIM, which actually provides only a
                  limited service, instead satisfies the broader set of
                  requirements. A DKIM signature : <list
                     style="symbols">
                     <t>Does not offer any assertions about the behaviors of the
                        identity doing the signing. </t>
                     <t>Does not prescribe any specific actions for receivers to take
                        upon successful (or unsuccessful) signature
                        verification. </t>
                     <t>Does not provide protection after signature verification. </t>
                     <t>Does not protect against re-sending (replay of) a message that
                        already has a verified signature; therefore a transit
                        intermediary or a recipient can re-post the message in
                        such a way that the signature would remain verifiable,
                        although the new recipient(s) would not have been
                        specified by the originator. </t>
                  </list>
               </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Prior Work">
               <t>Historical email assessment based on identity has been based
                  on the IP Address of a system that sent the message. The
                  Address is obtained via underlying Internet information
                  mechanisms and is therefore trusted to be accurate. Besides
                  having some known security weaknesses, the use of Addresses
                  present a number of functional and operational problems.
                  Consequently there is an industry desire to use a more
                  stable value that has had better correspondence with
                  organizational boundaries.
		  Domain Names are viewed as satisfying this need.</t>
               <t> There have been four previous efforts at standardizing an
                  Internet email signature scheme: <list style="symbols">
                     <t>Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) was first published in
                        1987. <xref target="RFC0989" />
                     </t>
                     <t>PEM eventually transformed into MIME Object Security
                        Services in 1995. <xref target="RFC1848" />
			Today, these two are only of historical interest.</t>
                     <t> Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) was developed by Phil
                        Zimmermann and first released in 1991.
			<xref target="RFC1991" />
			A later version was standardized as OpenPGP.
			<xref target="RFC2440" />
			<xref target="RFC3156" />
			<xref target="I-D.ietf-openpgp-rfc2440bis" />
			</t>
                     <t>RSA Security independently developed Secure MIME
                        (S/MIME) to transport a PKCS #7 data object.
			<xref target="RFC3851" /></t>
                  </list> Development of S/MIME and OpenPGP have continued.
                  While both have achieved a significant user base, neither
                  have achieved ubiquity in deployment or use, and their goals
                  differ from those of DKIM. </t>
               <t> To the extent that other message-signing services might
                  have been adapted to do the job that DKIM is designed to
                  perform, it was felt that re-purposing any of those would be
                  more problematic than creating a separate service. That
                  said, DKIM uses security algorithm components that have a
                  long history, including use within some of those other
                  messaging security services. </t>
               <t> DKIM has a distinctive approach for distributing and
                  vouching for keys. It uses a key-centric Public Key
                  Infrastructure (PKI) rather than the more typical approaches
                  based on a certificate in the styles of Kohnfelder (X.509)
                  or Zimmermann (web of trust). For DKIM, the owner of a key
                  asserts its validity, rather than relying on the key having a
                  broader semantic implication of the assertion, such as a
                  quality assessment of the key's owner. DKIM treats quality
                  assessment as an independent, value-added service, beyond
                  the initial work of deploying a verifying signature service. </t>
               <t> Further, DKIM's PKI is supported by adding additional information
                  records to the existing Domain Name Service (DNS) <xref
                     target="RFC1034" />, rather than requiring deployment of
                  a new query infrastructure. This approach has significant
                  operational advantages. First, it avoids the considerable
                  barrier of creating a new infrastructure; hence it leverages
                  a global base of administrative experience and highly
                  reliable distributed operation. Second, the technical aspect
                  of the DNS is already known to be efficient. Any new
                  service would have to undergo a period of gradual
                  maturation, with potentially problematic early-stage
                  behaviors. By (re-)using the DNS, DKIM avoids these growing
                  pains. </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Internet Mail Background">
               <t>Internet Mail has a simple split between the user world, in
                  the form of Mail User Agents (MUA), and the transmission
                  world, in the form of the Mail Handling Service (MHS)
                  composed of Mail Transfer Agents (MTA). The MHS is
                  responsible for accepting a message from one User and
                  delivering it to one or more other users, creating a virtual
                  MUA-to-MUA exchange environment. The first MTA is called the
                  Mail Submission Agent (MSA) and the final MTA is called the
                  Mail Delivery Agent (MDA).</t>
               <t>Modern Internet Mail service is marked by many independent
                  operators, many different components for providing users
                  with service and many other components for performing
                  message transfer. Consequently, it is necessary to
                  distinguish administrative boundaries that surround sets of
                  functional components.</t>
               <section anchor="Administrative" title="Administrative Actors">

                  <t>Operation of Internet Mail services is apportioned to
                     different providers (or operators). Each can be composed
                     of an independent ADministrative Management Domain
                     (ADMD). An ADMD operates with an independent set of
                     policies and interacts with other ADMDs according to
                     differing types and amounts of trust. Examples include:
                     an end-user operating their desktop client that connects
                     to an independent email service, a department operating a
                     submission agent or a local Relay, an organization's IT
                     group that operates enterprise Relays, and an ISP
                     operating a public shared email service. </t>
                  <t>Each of these can be configured into many combinations of
                     administrative and operational relationships, with each
                     ADMD potentially having a complex arrangement of

         <section title="Goals">
            <t>DKIM seeks to add authentication to the existing email transfer
               infrastructure. This motivates functional goals about
               authentication and operational goals about integration with the
               existing email service.</t>
            <section title="Functional">
               <t>
                  <list style="hanging">
                     <t hangText="Use Domain-level granularity for assurance.  ">
                        OpenPGP and S/MIME apply the end-to-end principle in
                        terms of individual originators and recipients,
                        notably using full email addresses. DKIM seeks
                        accountability at the more coarse grain of an
                        organization or, perhaps, a department. A deployed
                        construct that enables this granularity is the domain
                        name, to which the signing key record is bound.
                        Further DKIM signing and/or validating may be
                        implemented anywhere along the transit path, rather
                        than only in the end systems.</t>

                     <t hangText="Allow delegation of signing to independent parties.  ">
                        Different parties have different roles in the
                        process of email exchange. Some of these parties are
                        easily visible to end users and others are primarily
                        visible to operators of the service. DKIM needs to
                        support signing by any of these different parties and
                        needs to permit them to sign with any domain name that
                        they deem appropriate. As an example an organization
                        that creates email content often delegates portions of
                        its processing or transmission to an outsourced group.
                        DKIM must support this mode of activity, in a manner
                        that is not visible to end users. </t>
                     <t hangText="Distinguish the core authentication mechanism from its derivative uses.  ">
                        An authenticated identity may be subject to a
                        variety of processing policies, either ad hoc or
                        standardized. The only semantics inherent to a DKIM
                        signature is that the signer is asserting (some)
                        responsibility for the message. All other mechanisms
                        and meanings are independent of this core service. One
                        such mechanism might assert a relationship between the
                        signing identity and the author (&lt;RFC2822.From&gt;) domain
                        identity. Another might specify how to treat an unsigned
                        message with that &lt;RFC2822.From&gt; domain. </t>
                     <t hangText="Retain ability to have anonymous email.  ">
                        The ability to send a message that does not identify
                        its author is considered to be a valuable quality of
                        the current email system that needs to be retained.
                        DKIM is compatible with this goal since it permits an
                        email system operator to be authenticated, rather than
                        the content author. Knowing that a mail definitely
                        came from example.com does not threaten the anonymity
                        of the user, if it is still possible to obtain
                        effectively anonymous accounts at example.com and
                        other mail providers. </t>

                        S/MIME and OpenPGP both modify the message body. Hence,
                        their presence is potentially visible to email
                        recipients and their user software must be able to
                        process the associated constructs. In order to
                        facilitate incremental adoption, DKIM is designed to

                        verification failure as message failure. As a sub-goal
                        to the requirement for transparency, a DKIM signature
                        verifier is to treat messages with signatures that
                        fail as if they were unsigned. Hence the message will
                        revert to normal handling, through the receiver's
                        existing filtering mechanisms.</t>

                        benefits of DKIM increase dramatically as its adoption
                        increases.</t>

                        assessment of DKIM results, they are not essential in
                        order to obtain an initial benefit. For example DKIM
                        allows (possibly large) pair-wise sets of email
                        providers and spam filtering companies to distinguish
                        mail that is associated with a known organization,
                        from mail that might deceptively purport to have the
                        affiliation. This in turn allows the development of
                        'whitelist' schemes whereby authenticated mail from a
                        known source with good reputation is allowed to bypass
                        some spam filters. In effect the email receiver is
                        using their set of known relationships to generate
                        their own accreditation/reputation data. This works
                        particularly well for traffic between large sending
                        providers and large receiving providers. However it
                        also works well for any operator, public or private,
                        that has mail traffic dominated by exchanges among a
                        stable set of organizations. </t>

			A new service, or an enhancement to an existing
                        service, requires adoption by some number of systems,
                        before it can be useful. The greater the number of
                        required adopters, the higher the adoption barrier.
                        This becomes particularly serious when adoption is
                        required by intermediary -- that is, infrastructure --
                        service providers. In order to allow early adopters to
                        gain early benefit, DKIM seeks to make no changes to
                        the core Internet Mail service and, instead, to allow
                        a useful benefit for any signer/verifier pair of

         <section title="Function">

            <t>DKIM has a very constrained set of capabilities, primarily
               targeting email while it is in transit, from an originator to a
               set of recipients. It creates the ability to associate
               verifiable information with a message, especially a responsible
               identity. When a message is not signed, DKIM permits the
               identity of the sender to be used for obtaining information
               about their signing practices. </t>

            <section title="The Basic Signing Service">
               <t>With the DKIM signature mechanism, a signer associates a
                  domain name with an address, performs digital signing on the
                  message, and records signature information in a DKIM header
                  field. A verifier obtains the domain name from the DKIM
                  header field, queries for a public key associated with the
                  name, and verifies the signature.</t>
               <t>DKIM permits any domain name to be use for signing, and
                  supports extensible choices for various algorithms. As is
                  typical for Internet standards, there is a core set of
                  algorithms required to be supported by all implementations.
                  This ensures an initial ability to interoperate.</t>
               <t>DKIM permits restricting the use of a signature key to
                  particular types of services, such as only for email. This
                  is helpful when delegating signing authority, such as to a
                  particular department or to a third-party outsourcing
                  service.</t>
               <t>With DKIM the signer MUST explicitly list the headers that
                  are signed. By choosing the minimal set of headers needed
                  the signature is likely to be considerably more robust
                  against the handling vagaries of intermediary MTAs.</t>

            <section title="Characteristics of a DKIM signature">
               <!--   -->
               <t>A DKIM signature covers the message body and selected header
                  fields. The signer computes a hash of the selected header
                  fields and another hash of the body. The signer then uses a
                  private key to cryptographically encode this information,
                  along with other signing parameters. Signature information
                  is placed into a new <xref target="RFC2822" /> header field
                  of the message. </t>
            </section>
            <section title="The Selector construct">
               <!--   -->
               <t>A signature is associated with a domain name, as specified
                  in the "d=" DKIM parameter. That domain name is the complete
                  identity used for making assessments about the signer.
                  However this name is not sufficient for making a query to
                  obtain the key needed to verify the signature. </t>
               <t>A single domain can use multiple signing keys and/or
                  multiple signers. To support this, DKIM identifies a
                  particular signature as a combination of the domain name and
                  an added field, called the "selector". Both of these are
                  coded into the DKIM-Signature header field. </t>
               <t> It must be stressed that the selector is not part of the
                  domain name that is used for making assessments. Rather, the
                  selector is strictly reserved for use in administering keys
                  that are associated with the domain name. If the selector
                  becomes part of a name assessment mechanism, then there is
                  no remaining mechanism for making a transition from an old,
                  or compromised, key to a new one. </t>
               <t>Signers do have the need for supporting multiple assessments
                  about their organization, such as to distinguish one type of
                  message from another, or one portion of the organization
                  from another. To permit assessments that are
                  independent, an organization should use different
                  sub-domains in the "d=" parameter, such as
                  "transaction.example.com" versus "newsletter.example.com",
                  or productA.example.com versus productB.example.com.</t>

            <section title="Verification">
               <!--   -->
               <t>After a message has been signed, any agent in the message
                  transit path can choose to verify the signature, to
                  determine that the signing identity took responsibility for
                  the message. Message recipients can verify the signature by
                  querying the signer's domain directly to retrieve the
                  appropriate public key, and thereby confirm that the message
                  was attested to by a party in possession of the private key
                  for the signing domain. Typically, verification will be done
                  by an agent in the ADMD of the message recipient. </t>

            <t>As shown in the Figure, basic message processing is divided
               between signing the message, verifying the signature or
               determining whether a signature was required, and then making
               further decisions based upon the results. Signing may be
               performed by a component of the ADMD that creates the message,
               and/or within any ADMD, along the relay path. The signer uses
               the appropriate private key.</t>
            <t>Verification may be performed by any functional component along
               the relay and delivery path. Verifiers retrieve the public key
               based upon the parameters stored in the message. The figure
               shows the verified identity as being used to assess an
               associated reputation, but it could be applied for other tasks,
               such as management tracking of mail. </t>
            <t>Note that a failed signature causes the message to be treated
               in the same manner as one that is unsigned. Unsigned messages
               prompt a query for any published "sender practices"
               information, as an aid in determining whether the sender
               information has been used without authorization.</t>
            <t> For signature verification and for the assessment of unsigned
               messages, the results of these processes are treated as
               additional input to the receiver's filtering engine. The engine
               determines message disposition, such as whether to deliver
            it.</t>

            <section title="Coding Criteria for Cryptographic Applications">

               <t>Correct implementation of a cryptographic algorithm is a
                  necessary but not a sufficient condition for the coding of
                  cryptographic applications. Coding of cryptographic
                  libraries requires close attention to security
                  considerations that are unique to cryptographic
                  applications.</t>
               <t>In addition to the usual security coding considerations,
                  such as avoiding buffer or integer overflow and underflow,
                  implementers should pay close attention to management of
                  cryptographic private keys and session keys, ensuring that
                  these are correctly initialized and disposed of.</t>
               <t>Operating system mechanisms that permit the confidentiality
                  of private keys to be protected against other processes
                  SHOULD be used when available. In particular, great care
                  MUST be taken when releasing memory pages to the operating
                  system to ensure that private key information is not
                  disclosed to other processes.</t>
               <t>On multiple processor and dual core architectures, certain
                  implementations of public key algorithms such as RSA may be
                  vulnerable to a timing analysis attack.</t>
               <t>Support for cryptographic hardware providing key management
                  capabilities is strongly encouraged. In addition to offering
                  performance benefits, many cryptographic hardware devices
                  provide robust and verifiable management of private keys.</t>
               <t>Fortunately appropriately designed and coded cryptographic
                  libraries are available for most operating system platforms
                  under license terms compatible with commercial, open source
                  and free software license terms. Use of standard
                  cryptographic libraries is strongly encouraged. These have
                  been extensively tested, reduce development time and support
                  a wide range of cryptographic hardware.</t>

               <t>Signer implementations SHOULD provide a convenient means of
                  generating DNS key records corresponding to the signer
                  configuration. Support for automatic insertion of key
                  records into the DNS is also highly desirable. If supported
                  however, such mechanism(s) MUST be properly authenticated.</t>
               <t>A means of verifying that the signer configuration is
                  compatible with the signature policy is also highly
                  desirable.</t>
               <t>Disclosure of a private signature key component to a third
                  party allows that third party to impersonate the sender.
                  The protection of private signature key data is therefore a
                  critical concern. Signers SHOULD support use of
                  cryptographic hardware providing key management features. </t>
               <t>The import and export of private keys, and the ability to
                  generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for certificate
                  registration are highly desirable.</t>

            <t>Developers of filtering schemes designed to accept DKIM
               authentication results as input should be aware that their
               implementations will be subject to counter-attack by email
               abusers. The efficacy of a filtering scheme cannot therefore be
               determined by reference to static test vectors alone;
               resistance to counter attack must also be considered.</t>
            <t>Naive learning algorithms that only consider the presence or
               absence of a verified DKIM signature, without considering
	       more information about the message,
	       are vulnerable to an
               attack in which a spammer or other malefactor signs all their
               mail, thus creating a large negative value for presence of a
               DKIM signature in the hope of discouraging widespread use.</t>
            <t>If heuristic algorithms are employed, they should be trained on
               feature sets that sufficiently reveal the internal structure of
               the DKIM responses. In particular the algorithm should consider
               the domains purporting to claim responsibility for the
               signature, rather than the existence of a signature or not.</t>
            <t>Unless a scheme can correlate the DKIM signature with
               accreditation or reputation data, the presence of a DKIM

                  obtains the private key is not specified by DKIM. Given that DKIM
                  is intended for use during email transit, rather than for
                  long-term storage, it is expected that keys will be changed

                     signature for that message. The DKIM-Signature header in
                     the message will specify the basic domain name doing the
                     signing and the selector to be used for the specific
                     public key. Hence, the relevant

                  <t>The module doing signing can be placed anywhere within an
                     organization's trusted Administrative Management Domain
                     (ADMD); common choices are expected to be
                     department-level posting and delivering agents, as well
                     as boundary MTAs to the open Internet. (Note that it is
                     entirely acceptable for MUAs to perform signing and
                     verification.) Hence the choice among the modules depends
                     upon software development and administrative overhead
                     tradeoffs. One perspective that helps resolve this choice
                     is the difference between the flexibility of use by
                     systems at (or close to) the MUA, versus the centralized
                     control that is more easily obtained by implementing the

                  <t>Every organization (ADMD) will have its own policies and
                     practices for deciding when to sign messages and with
                     what domain name and key (selector). Examples include
                     signing all mail, signing mail from particular email
                     addresses, or signing mail from particular sub-domains.
                     Given this variability, and the likelihood that signing
                     practices will change over time, it will be useful to
                     have these decisions represented in some sort of
                     configuration information, rather than being more deeply
                     coded into the signing software.</t>

                  <t>Verifiers SHOULD treat the result of the verification
                     step as an input to the message evaluation process rather
                     than as providing a final decision. The knowledge that a
                     message is authentically sent by a domain does not say
                     much about the legitimacy of the message, unless the
                     characteristics of the domain claiming responsibility are
                     known.</t>
                  <t>In particular, verifiers SHOULD NOT automatically assume
                     that an email message that does not contain a signature,
                     or that contains a signature that does not verify, is
                     forged. Verifiers should treat a signature that fails to
                     verify the same as if no signature were present.</t>
               </section>
               <t>Verification is performed within an ADMD that wishes to make
                  assessments based upon the DKIM signature's domain name. Any
                  component within the ADMD that handles messages, whether in
                  transit or being delivered, can do the verifying and
                  subsequent assessments. Verification and assessment might
                  occur within the same software mechanism, such as a Boundary
                  MTA, or an MDA. Or they may be separated, such as having
                  verification performed by the Boundary MTA and assessment
                  performed by the MDA.</t>
               <t>As with the signing process, choice of service venues for
                  verification and assessment -- such as filtering or
                  presentation to the recipient user -- depend on trade-offs
                  for flexibility, control, and operational ease. An added
                  concern is that the linkage between verification and
                  assessment entails essential trust: the assessment module
                  MUST have a strong basis for believing that the verification
                  information is correct.</t>

                  <t>The primary means of publishing DKIM key information,
                     initially, is initially through DNS TXT records. Some DNS
                     client software might have problems obtaining these
                     records; as DNS client software improves this will not be
                     a concern.</t>

                  <t>In order for an assessment module to trust the
                     information it receives about verification (e.g.,
                     Authentication-Results headers), it MUST eliminate
                     verification information originating from outside the
                     ADMD in which the assessment mechanism operates. As a

            <!-- 9 - Phil -->
            <t>This section describes the basic steps for operation of email
               systems that use DKIM, after the capability has initially been
               deployed. The primary considerations are: <list style="symbols">
                  <t> the upkeep of the selector files, and </t>
                  <t>the security of the private keys. </t>
               </list></t>
            <section title="DNS Signature Record Installation Considerations">
               <t> Even with use of the DNS, one challenge is that DNS record management is
                  usually operated by an administrative staff that is different from
                  those who operate an organization's email service. In order
                  to ensure that DKIM DNS records are accurate, this imposes a
                  requirement for careful coordination between the two
                  operations groups. </t>
               <!--  - Phil -->
               <t> The key point to remember is that the DNS DKIM selectors
                  WILL and SHOULD be changed over time. Some reasons for
                  changing DKIM selectors are well understood, while others are
                  still theoretical. There are several schemes that may be
                  used to determine the policies for changing DKIM selectors:
                     <list style="symbols">
                     <t>time based</t>
                     <t>associations with clusters of servers</t>
                     <t>the use of third party signers</t>
                     <t>security considerations</t>
                  </list>
               </t>
               <section title="Time Basis and Security Considerations">
                  <!--  - Phil -->
                  <t> The reason for changing the selector periodically is
                     usually related to the security exposure of a system.
                     When the potential exposure of the private keys
                     associated with the DKIM selector have reached sufficient
                     levels, the selector should be changed. (It is unclear
                     currently what kinds of metrics can be used to aid in
                     deciding when the exposure has reached sufficient levels
                     to warrant changing the selector.) </t>
                  <t> For example, <list style="symbols">
                        <t> Selectors should be changed more frequently on
                           systems that are widely exposed, than on systems
                           that are less widely exposed. For example, a
                           gateway system that has numerous
                           externally-accessible services running on it, is
                           more widely exposed than one that ONLY runs a mail
                           server. </t>
                        <t> Selectors should be changed more frequently on
                           operating systems that are under wide attack. </t>
                        <t> While the use of DKIM information is transient,
                           keys with sufficient exposure do become stale and
                           should be changed. </t>
                        <t>Whenever you make a substantial system change, such
                           as bringing up a new server, or making a major
                           operating system change, you should consider
                           changing the selector. </t>
                        <t> Whenever there is either suspicion or evidence of
                           the compromise of the system or the private keys,
                           you should change the selector. </t>

               <section title="Deploying New Selectors">
                  <!--  - Phil -->
                  <t> A primary consideration in changing the selector is
                     remembering to change it. It needs to be a standard part
                     of the operational staff Methods and Procedures for your
                     systems. If they are separate, both the mail team and the
                     DNS team will be involved in deploying new selectors. </t>
                  <t> When deploying a new selector, it needs to be phased in:
                        <list style="numbers">
                        <t>Generate the new public / private key pair and
                           create a new selector record with the public key in it.</t>
                        <t>Add the new selector record to your DNS.</t>
                        <t>Verify that the new selector record can be used to
                           verify signatures.</t>
                        <t>Turn on signing with the new private key.</t>
                        <t>Remove the old private key from your servers.</t>

                           from your DNS.</t>
                     </list> The time an unused selector should be kept in the
                     DNS system is dependent on the reason it's being changed.
                     If the private key has definitely been exposed, the
                     corresponding selector should be removed immediately.
                     Otherwise, longer periods are allowable. </t>

                  <t> A Domain Name is the basis for making differential
                     quality assessments about a DKIM-signed message. It is
                     reasonable for a single organization to have a variety of
                     very different activities, which warrant a variety of
                     very different assessments. A convenient way to
                     distinguish among such activities is to sign with
                     different domain names. That is, the organization should
                     sign with sub-domain names that are used for different
                     organizational activities. </t>

                  <t>Allowing third parties to sign email from your domain

                     the third parties to use the same selector and private
                     key as your main mail system. It is recommended that each
                     third party be given their own private key and selector.
                     This limits the exposure for any given private key, and

               <t> A mailing list often provides facilities to its
                  administrator to manipulate parts of the mail messages that
                  flow through the list. The desired goal is that messages
                  flowing through the mailing list will be verifiable by the
                  recipient as being from the list, or failing that, as being
                  from the individual list members. </t>
               <t> In most cases, the list and/or its mail host SHOULD add its
                  own DKIM signature to list mail. This could be done in the
                  list management software, in an outgoing MSA or MTA, or
                  both. List management software often makes modifications to
                  messages that will break incoming signatures, such as adding
                  subject tags, adding message headers or footers, and adding,
                  deleting, or reordering MIME parts. By adding its own
                  signature after these modifications, the list provides a
                  verifiable, recognizable signature for list recipients. </t>
               <t> In some cases, the modifications made by the mailing list

                  signatures on incoming messages will still be verifiable
                  after being remailed by the list. It is still preferable
                  that the list sign its mail so that recipients can
                  distinguish between mail sent through the list and mail sent
                  directly to a list member. In the absence of a list
                  signature, a recipient may still be able to recognize and use the

               A mailing list often manipulates header fields or content of

            <t> A DKIM signature tells the signature verifier that the owner
               of a particular domain name accepts responsibility for the
               message. Combining this information with information that
               allows the history of the domain name owner to be assessed may
               allow processing the message, based on the probability that the

               <t>One identity is particularly amenable to easy and accurate

                  mail is, in fact, from within the organization. DKIM can be
                  used to remedy this exposure. If the organization signs all

                  reputation data from a third party. In either case the use
                  of reputation data is intrinsically limited to email senders
                  that have established a prior history of sending messages. </t>
               <t> In fact, an email receiving service may be in a position to
                  establish bilateral agreements with particular senders, such
                  as business partners or trusted bulk sending services.
                  Although it is not practical for each recipient to accredit
                  every sender, the definition of core networks of explicit trust
                  can be quite useful. </t>

                  <t>For scaling efficiency, it is appealing to have Trusted
                     Third Party assessment services, to allow an email sender
                     to obtain a single assessment that is then recognized by
                     every email recipient that recognizes the Trusted Third
                     Party.</t>

            <section title="DKIM Support in the Client">
               <!--  - Dave -->
               <t> The DKIM specification is expected to be used primarily
                  between Boundary MTAs, or other infrastructure components of
                  the originating and receiving ADMDs. However there is
                  nothing in DKIM that is specific to those venues. In
                  particular, it should be possible to support signing and
                  verifying in MUAs.</t>
               <t> However, it is common for components of an ADMD's email
                  infrastructure to do violence to a message, such as to render a
                  DKIM signature invalid. Hence, users of MUAs that support
                  DKIM signing and/or verifying need a basis for knowing that
                  their associated email infrastructure will not break a
                  signature. </t>
               <t> DKIM requires that all verifiers treat messages with
                  signatures that do not verify as if they are unsigned. If
                  verification in the client is to be acceptable to users, it
                  is also essential that successful verification of a
                  signature not result in a less than satisfactory user
                  experience compared to leaving the message unsigned. </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Per user signatures">
               <!--  - Dave -->
               <t> Although DKIM's use of domain names is optimized for a
                  scope of organization-level signing, it is possible to administer
                  sub-domains and/or selectors in a way that
                  supports per-user signing. <list style="hanging">
                     <t hangText="NOTE:  ">As stated earlier, it is important
                        to distinguish between the use of selectors for
                        differential administration of keys, versus the use of
                        sub-domains for differential reputations.</t>
                  </list> As a constraint on an authorized DKIM signing agent,
                  their associated key record can specify restrictions on the
                  email addresses permitted to be signed with that domain and
                  key. A typical intent of this feature is to allow a company
                  to delegate the signing authority for bulk marketing
                  communications without the risk of effectively delegating
                  the authority to sign messages purporting to come from the
                  domain-owning organization's CEO. </t>
               <t>
                  <list style="hanging">
                     <t hangText="NOTE:  "> Any scheme that involves
                        maintenance of a significant number of public keys is
                        likely to require infrastructure enhancements, to
                        support that management. For example, a system in
                        which the end user is required to generate a public
                        key pair and transmit it to the DNS administrator out
                        of band is not likely to meet acceptance criteria for
                        either usability or security. </t>
