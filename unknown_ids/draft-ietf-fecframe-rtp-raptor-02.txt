Abstract

   This document specifies an RTP Payload Format for Forward Error
   Correction repair data produced by the Raptor FEC Schemes.  Raptor

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Fromat for Raptor         October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The FEC Framework [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] defines a general
   framework for the use of Forward Error Correction in association with
   arbitrary packet flows, including flows over UDP and RTP.  Forward
   Error Corrections operates by generating redundant data packets
   ("repair data") which can be sent independently from the original
   flow.  At a receiver the original flow can be reconstructed provided
   a sufficient set of redundant data packets and possibly original data
   packets are received.

   The FEC Framework provides for independence between application
   protocols and FEC codes.  The use of a particular FEC code within the
   framework is defined by means of an FEC Scheme which may then be used
   with any application protocol compliant to the framework.

   Repair data flows may be sent directly over a transport protocol such
   as UDP, or they may be encapsulated within RTP.  In the latter case,
   an RTP Payload Format must be defined for each FEC Scheme.

   This document defines the RTP Payload Format for the Raptor FEC
   Schemes defined in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor].

3.  Media Format Background

   The Raptor code is an efficient XOR-based block-based fountain code,
   meaning that from any group of source packets (or 'source block') an
   arbitrary number of repair packets may be generated.  The Raptor code
   has the property that the original group of source packets can be
   recovered with very high probability from any set of packets (source
   and repair) only slightly greater in number than the original number
   of source packets.

   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor] defines three FEC Schemes for the use of
   the Raptor code with arbitary packet flows: the first scheme is fully
   applicable to arbitary packet flows.  The second scheme is a slightly
   optimised version of the first scheme which is applicable in
   applications with relatively small block sizes.  The third scheme is
   a variant of the second scheme which is applicable to a single source
   flow which already has some kind of identifiable sequence number.
   The presence of a sequence number in the source flow allows for
   backwards compatible operation (the source flows do not need to be
   modified in order to apply FEC).  In this case, in the language of
   the FEC Framework, there is no explicit FEC Source Payload Id.

4.  Payload Format

   The RTP Payload contains a FEC Repair Payload as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor].

4.1.  RTP Header Usage

   The rules SHALL be followed for the RTP header used with FEC repair
   packets:

   o  Marker bit: The marker bit shall be set 1 for the last protection
      RTP packet sent for each source block, and otherwise set to 0

   o  Timestamp: The timestamp SHALL be set to a time corresponding to
      the packet's transmission time.  The timestamp value has no use in
      the actual FEC protection process.  It may be used for packet
      arrival timing and jitter calculations.

4.2.  Payload Header

   There is no Payload Header in this Payload Format

4.3.  Payload Data

   The RTP Payload contains a FEC Repair Payload as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] and [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor].
