Abstract

   It is a common practice to install a (soft or hard) loop on a
   circuit interface for various purposes (e.g. circuit turn-up test).
   However, this practice results in disabling IPv6 on an interface
   even after the loop is removed, due to the way IPv6 duplicate
   address detection is performed.

   This document describes a mechanism to allow IPv6 to self-heal after
   such a loop is placed & removed.

1. Introduction

   One of the common fault-isolation practices in network operations is
   to install a (soft or hard) loop on a circuit interface for
   troubleshooting physical/transport layer (layer1) issues.

   However, this practice may jeopardize IPv6 [RFC4291] functionality
   of an interface (corresponding to the circuit being looped) after
   the loop is removed. This is because the loop results in the router
   to receive the messages such as the ones relating to IPv6 Duplicate
   Address Detection [RFC4862], and consequently disable IPv6 on that
   interface, due to DAD check failure per [RFC4862] section 5.4.5.

   When the (soft) loop is removed (note that removing soft loop,
   unlike hard loop, does not result in the interface status changes),
   the interface stays UP, and IPv6 functionality stays disabled. The
   only way to fix this is by the manual intervention (e.g. manually
   assign an IPv6 link-local address on that interface and then remove
   it, resulting in DAD to be triggered and enabling IPv6 on that
   interface).

     On the other hand, IPv4 continues to function fine after the loop
     is removed (partly because IPv4 does not have DAD like procedure)
     with or without the 'warning' about duplicate IPv4 address when
     the loop existed.

   This problem is built-into IPv6 DAD and needs to be fixed so as to
   simplify IPv6-provisioned interfaces turn-up and maintenance
   afterwards.

   This document describes a mechanism to allow IPv6 to self-heal after
   the physical/transport layer looping of the interface. The fix is
   intended to be a simple extension to the ND/DAD logic itself without
   requiring any new messages.

   This document is intended to update RFC4862.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Solution

   There are two methods for solving this issue.



3.1. Solution 1 - Static Configuration

   One may simply disable DAD on an interface and avoid the problem
   described in section 1 altogether. While this Solution may be the
   simplest and well suited for certain point-to-point interfaces, it
   has three drawbacks -

   1. it would likely require carefully figuring out such point-to-
      point interfaces,
   2. a one-time manual configuration on each of such interfaces, and
   3. more importantly, it would likely result in IPv6 brokenness if
      the other side of the router got misconfigured with the same IPv6
      address (since there wouldn't be any DAD to catch such errors).

   Nonetheless, an implementation may still provide this solution as
   the lowest hanging fruit.



3.2. Solution 2 - Dynamic Logic

   This solution option expands DAD with a logic (that will stay
   enabled by default) to make IPv6 self-healing without requiring any
   manual configuration.

   In this, If an IPv6 node receives an IPv6 NS message corresponding
   to DAD [RFC4862] and having the same source link-layer address and
   same IPv6 address (in Target Address field) as the ones (to be)
   assigned to the receiving interface, then the IPv6 node must do the
   following:

   1. Log the duplicate address & the interface (or generate a warning)
   2. Send another NS message (for DAD) with a Nonce option (section
     5.3.2 of [RFC3971]), and fire up the timer
   3. If the same NS message (as the one transmitted) is received, then
     keep IPv6 enabled on that interface
   4. If the timer expires, then go back to step 2

   5. If the same NS message (as the one transmitted) is not received
     (upon timer expiry), then enforce DAD criteria [RFC4862] for
     keeping IPv6 enabled (or disabled) on that interface

   The timer value is 60 seconds by default, but an implementation may
   allow a configurable option to override the default value. Please
   note that the Nonce option is included in the NS message just to
   detect the NS message being looped. If the remote router happens to
   receive such an NS message, then it MUST silently ignore the Nonce
   option.

   This solution simply paves the way for re-running DAD after
   detecting the loop has been removed, and ultimately enabling IPv6 on
   an interface. Suffice to say that this option is preferred and it
   requires no new message or option.

7. Appendix

7.1. Use Case #1
                                                                                A network operator turns up the circuit (i.e. interface) for the 1st
   time. And it installs the loop on that interface for initial checks
   and removes it afterwards. This results in IPv4 working fine, but
   IPv6 staying disabled (as described in section 1).

7.2. Use Case #2

   A network operator installs a loop on a working circuit (i.e.
   interface) for layer1 troubleshooting and removes it afterwards.
   This results in IPv4 working fine, but IPv6 staying disabled (as
   described in section 1).
