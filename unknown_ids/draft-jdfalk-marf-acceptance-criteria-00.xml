		<abstract>
			<t> All known Feedback Generators (the operators of complaint feedback loops) have
				some criteria for acceptance of requests to receive feedback.  This document is
				a review of such criteria, where publicly available.  It is intended to inform
				design decisions within the <xref target="MARF-WG">Mail Abuse Reporting Format 
				(MARF) Working Group</xref>, and likely will never advance beyond internet-draft 
				status. </t>
				
			<t> The information included herein was gathered from public web sites. </t>

			<t> First, AOL offers subscribers a drop-down list consisting of abuse@, postmaster@, 
				and "any other email address listed in the FBL email's domain WHOIS record."  A 
				prospective subscriber may choose one of these addresses to receive a confirmation 
				message.  The message includes a unique URI which, when opened, confirms that the 
				subscriber has permission to receive feedback related to that domain. </t>

			<t> Next, AOL attempts to prove ownership of the IP addresses (AOL's feedback loop is based 
				on last-hop IP address, not domain.)  For this, they require that one of five criteria 
				is met:
				
				<list style="numbers">
					<t> reverse DNS (PTR record) for each IP shares the domain name selected in the first step
					</t>
			
					<t> at least one authoritative nameserver for each IP shares the domain name </t>
			
					<t> IP WHOIS information for each IP contains the domain </t>
			
					<t> ASN WHOIS information contains the domain </t>
				</list>
			</t>

		<section title="BlueTie">
			<t> BlueTie is perhaps best known as the mailbox provider behind Excite. </t>
			
			<t> <eref target="http://feedback.bluetie.com/" /> </t>
			
			<t> Like all feedback loops hosted by Return Path, the subscriber must first select
				either postmaster@ or abuse@ their domain to receive a confirmation message.
				The message includes a unique URI which, when opened, confirms that the 
				subscriber has permission to receive feedback related to that domain. </t>
				
			<t> BlueTie has not published additional criteria. </t>

		<section title="Comcast">
			<t> <eref target="http://postmaster.comcast.net/feedback-loop.aspx" /> </t>
			
			<t> Like all feedback loops hosted by Return Path, the subscriber must first select
				either postmaster@ or abuse@ their domain to receive a confirmation message.
				The message includes a unique URI which, when opened, confirms that the 
				subscriber has permission to receive feedback related to that domain. </t>
			
			<t> Comcast also publishes the following criteria:
				
				<list style="symbols">
					<t> IPs with a <xref target='SS'>Sender Score</xref> of 60 or above will be 
						accepted. </t>
					
					<t> IPs with a Sender Score of 30 to 60 cannot appear on any DNSBLs. </t>
					
					<t> IP with a Sender Score below 30 will not be approved. </t>
				</list>
			</t>

		<section title="Cox">
			<t> <eref target="http://postmaster.cox.net/confluence/display/postmaster/Feedback+Loop" />
			</t>
			
			<t> Like all feedback loops hosted by Return Path, the subscriber must first select
				either postmaster@ or abuse@ their domain to receive a confirmation message.
				The message includes a unique URI which, when opened, confirms that the 
				subscriber has permission to receive feedback related to that domain. </t>
			
			<t> Cox also publishes the following criteria:
				
				<list style="symbols">
					<t> An IP or range with a <xref target='SS'>Sender Score</xref> of 60 or higher 
						will be approved. </t>
					<t> An IP or range with a Sender Score between 30 and 60 may be approved if 
						not listed on any RBLs. </t>
				   	<t> A score of less than 30, or no score due to not enough traffic from the 
						IP, will be denied. </t>
				</list>
			</t>   
		</section>
		
		<section title="Earthlink">
			<t> Multiple sources, including <xref target="WTTW" />, report that Earthlink
			 	provides feedback only to fellow ISPs.  Their specific criteria do not appear
				to be public. </t>

			<t> Microsoft's "Junk Mail Reporting" program covers Hotmail, MSN, and Windows Live
				Mail. </t>
				
			<t> <eref target="https://support.msn.com/eform.aspx?productKey=edfsjmrpp&page=support_home_options_form_byemail&ct=eformts&scrx=1" /> </t>
			
			<t> While Microsoft does not publicize the precise criteria used, some of the questions
				asked by their sign-up form provide some clues:
				
				<list style="symbols">
					<t> How would you describe your company or yourself? (multiple choice)</t>
					
					<t> The home page where people sign up for your service </t>
					
					<t> The opt-out link for each list or a link to your organization's Privacy Policy
					</t>
					
					<t> Sender IPs for verification </t>
					
					<t> Are the IP addresses registered under your company's name or domain name? </t>
					
					<t> If no, do you have exclusive sending rights from the IP via your hosting 
						company (not shared with any other senders)? </t>
					
					<t> Can you remove customers who complain from your lists, or take action against 
						spam accounts? </t>
				</list>

		<section title="Outblaze">
			<t> <eref target="http://spamblock.outblaze.com/" /> </t>
			
			<t> <xref target="WTTW">Word to the Wise</xref> reports that Outblaze's complaint
				feedback loop is only available to senders who confirm all subscription (opt-in)
				requests to their lists.  Other sources have reported that Outblaze's complaint
				feedback loop is tied to their whitelisting program.  The specifics do not appear
				to have been publicized. </t>

		<section title="OpenSRS">
			<t> OpenSRS is a mail hosting service operated by Tucows. </t>
			
			<t> <eref target="http://fbl.hostedemail.com/" /> </t>
			
			<t> Like all feedback loops hosted by Return Path, the subscriber must first select
				either postmaster@ or abuse@ their domain to receive a confirmation message.
				The message includes a unique URI which, when opened, confirms that the 
				subscriber has permission to receive feedback related to that domain. </t>

		<section title="Yahoo!">
			<t> <eref target="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/postmaster/feedback/" /> </t>
			
			<t> Yahoo!'s is currently the only known complaint feedback loop where complaints are
				routed based on the <xref target="DKIM" /> d= domain of the offending message,
				rather than last-hop IP address.  Thus, the primary initial criteria is that the
				prospective subscriber sign all their outbound mail with DKIM. </t>
				
			<t> (They do route by IP for ISPs, using unpublished criteria to determine whether an 
				ISP qualifies.) </t>
				
			<t> The signup process requires a free Yahoo! user ID, after which (like all feedback
				loop signup pages hosted by Return Path) the subscriber must select either
				postmaster@ or abues@ their domain to receive a confirmation message.  The message 
				includes a unique URI which, when opened, confirms that the subscriber has 
				permission to receive feedback related to that domain. </t>
			
			<t> Yahoo! has not published additional criteria. </t>
