Internet-Draft           6to4 DHCP Router Option                May 2011


1.  Introduction

   Using 6to4 [RFC 3056] currently requires manual configuration of the
   relay router or the use of a anycast relay router [RFC 3068].  The
   latter has a number of well known issues (add reference).

   This document attempts to address some of those issues by providing a
   method for clients to discover the address of a 6to4 relay router.
   It is expected that the 6to4 relay router will be managed and that it
   will be topologically close to the client thereby reducing some of
   the issues with using public anycast relay routers.

   Additionally not all IPv4 address allocated to clients are suitable
   for use with 6to4.  Whether they be [RFC 1918] address, or other
   addresses behind a NAT, or are behind a firewall which blocks 6to4
   encapsulted traffic.  This document provides a method for the DHCP
   server operator to signal that the address being returned is not
   suitable for use with 6to4.


2.  6to4 Relay Router Option

   The 6to4 DHCP relay option has code TBD and consists of a single IPv4
   address specifing the IPv4 address of the 6to4 relay router.  Setting
   the relay router address to 0.0.0.0 indicates that 6to4 will not work
   for returned lease address.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      TBD      |       4       |          relay router         ~
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
      ~            address            |
      +-------------------------------+


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a DHCP option code point.


4.  Security Considerations

   A rogue DHCP server advertising this option can cause 6to4 traffic to
   be redirected anywhere in the world.

   Setting the returned address to 0.0.0.0 can be used to deny 6to4
   service when it would otherwise work.
