Internet-Draft                LMA Discovery                     May 2009


Abstract

   This draft defines a Domain Name System (DNS)-based scheme to enable
   dynamic discovery of a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in Proxy Mobile
   IPv6.  DNS Service Resource Record option is used allowing a Mobile
   Access Gateway (MAG) to request the LMA's Fully Qualified Domain Name
   (FQDN) and possibly IP address via the DNS response.  IPv4 case is
   also covered.

Internet-Draft                LMA Discovery                     May 2009


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.giaretta-netlmm-mip-interactions] describes possible scenarios
   which require an interaction between PMIPv6 and MIPv6.  In a similar
   scenario depicted in Figure 1, some mobile nodes use Mobile IPv6 to
   manage their movements while others rely on a network-based mobility
   solution provided by the network.  There is a common mobility anchor
   that acts as Mobile IPv6 Home Agent and Proxy Mobile IPv6 LMA,
   depending on the type of the node.

             Figure 1: Hybrid deployment with MIPv6 and PMIPv6

   Before a MAG or a MN can engage in mobility management signaling with
   the mobility anchor (LMA or HA), it SHOULD either know the IP address
   of the mobility anchor via pre-configuration, or dynamically discover
   it.

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 can be offered as a service in an operator domain.
   Domain name system contains mechanisms for the clients (Mobile Access
   Gateways in lieue of Mobile Nodes) to query the names of the local
   mobility anchors that provide Proxy Mobile IPv6 service and get back
   the names.  Service resource records (SRV RR) defined in [RFC2782]
   enable the servers like local mobility anchors to publish information
   about their services in the DNS database in terms of SRV RRs.  Some
   local mobility anchors may be designated as primary servers and
   others as backup servers.

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC5213].


3.  LMA Discovery by DNS Service Name

   Figure 2 shows the message sequence for dynamic LMA discovery using
   DNS.  The following details apply.

                 Figure 2: Dynamic LMA Discovery Using DNS

   The mobile node executes the network access authentication procedure
   (e.g., IEEE802.1X or IKEv2 SA establishment followed by EAP
   authentication) and it interacts with the NAS/MAG.  The NAS/MAG
   interacts with the AAA server to authenticate the mobile node.  In
   the process of authorizing the mobile node, the AAA server verifies
   in the AAA profile that the mobile node is allowed to use the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 service.  The AAA server possibly assigns a LMA address
   and returns this information to the NAS through Diameter
   [I-D.korhonen-dime-pmip6] or RADIUS [I-D.xia-netlmm-radius], thus, it
   is not necessary to continue with steps 2 and 3.  If AAA server
   returns the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of LMA to the NAS then

Internet-Draft                LMA Discovery                     May 2009


   MAG queries the DNS infrastructure in order to resolve the FQDN to
   the LMA [I-D.korhonen-netlmm-lma-discovery].  Otherwise, the MAG
   continues the following DNS exchanges to do a DNS lookup by service
   name.

   The MAG as DNS client sends a DNS query to retrieve SRV RRs for Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 service using IPv6 protocol for a specific domain (Step 2
   in Figure 2).  Once MAG receives in the DNS Query Reply all SRV RRs
   containing information about multiple local mobility anchors it is up
   to the MAG to select one local mobility anchor (Step 3 in Figure 2).
   After selecting the local mobility anchor, MAG proceeds with
   registering the mobile node with this server as described in
   [RFC5213].

   The format of the SRV RR is:
      _Service._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target

   MAG MUST use the service name "pmip6" and the protocol name "ipv6".
   The protocol name "ipv4" MAY be used as discussed in Section 4.  SRV
   RR's DNS type code is 33.  Name is the domain that this RR refers to.

3.1.  Transmission of DNS Queries

   LMA discovery by DNS service name is based on the clients, e.g.  MAGs
   retrieving the servers', e.g. local mobility anchors service resource
   records (SRV RRs) from the DNS infrastructure.  If SRV RRs are not
   available in the domain this technique should not be used.

   In sending the DNS query, MAG MUST extract the domain name from the
   Mobile Node Identifier (MN-Identifier) [RFC5213] such as Network
   Access Identifier (NAI) [RFC4282].  If NAI is not available MAG MUST
   use its own domain name.  The resulting QNAME takes the form of
   "_pmip6_ipv6.operatorname.com".  In most cases an SRV RR with
   QNAME=_pmip6._ipv6.operatorname.com, QCLASS=IN and QTYPE=SRV would be
   sufficient.

3.2.  Receiving Answers to DNS Queries

   If more than one local mobility anchor are available in the SRV RR
   mobility access gateway is responsible for selecting one local
   mobility anchor.  The choice could be based on the preference and
   weight values in SRV RRs received.  [RFC2782] presents domain
   administrator advices the preference and weight values which could be
   followed.

   The answer to the DNS query contains one or more fully qualified
   domain names (FQDN) of one or more local mobility anchors.  In that
   case mobility access gateway MUST resolve the IP addresses in a



Sarikaya & Xia          Expires November 26, 2009               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                LMA Discovery                     May 2009


   separate DNS query.  However this is undesirable as it requires an
   additional DNS query round trip.  DNS servers are RECOMMENDED to
   return IP addresses in AAAA records also in the SRV reply.

   Caching local mobility anchor addresses in mobility access gateways
   may also save DNS round trips.  If the policy indicates that the
   mobile nodes in the same domain be served by the same local mobility
   anchor, mobility access gateway may immediately start registration
   procedures with that local mobility anchor after the mobile node's
   access authentication terminates successfully.

3.3.  Example Processing at MAG

   Mobility access gateway makes a DNS SRV RR query for the mobile node
   whose MN-ID is 123456789.  DNS reply contains the following FQDNs:


       lma-central.example.com
       lma-east.example.com
       lma-dfw.example.com
       lma-nyc.example.com
       lma-sfbay.example.com
       lma-west.example.com


   Assume that the preference and weight values of all SRV RRs are the
   same.  Mobility access gateway MAY choose one randomly based on
   MN-ID.

   One such random choice could be made by calculating MN-ID modulus the
   number of local mobility anchor FDQNs returned.  In the case of the
   above example, this yields:


        MN-ID mod number of SRV RRs = 123456789 mod 6
        = 3


   Therefore mobility access gateway assigns lma-dfw.example.com to this
   MN, makes another DNS query to get this local mobility anchor's
   address.


4.  IPv4 Support

   Local mobility anchors may have IPv4 addresses called IPv4 Local
   Mobility Anchor Address (IPv4-LMAA)
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].  Mobility access gateways need



Sarikaya & Xia          Expires November 26, 2009               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                LMA Discovery                     May 2009


   to discover IPv4-LMAA in two cases: the mobile node is an IPv4 node
   or the transport between mobility access gateway and local mobility
   anchor is IPv4.

   In [RFC4472] the use of separate service names or the same name for
   IPv4 and IPv6 users is discussed.  [RFC4472] recommends using the
   same name, e.g. pmip6.operatorname.com to indicate that Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 service is available to both IPv6 and IPv4 hosts.

   In this specification we also define "pmip6" service for "ipv4"
   protocol.  Mobile access gateway MUST use
   QNAME=_pmip6._ipv4.operatorname.com in SRV RR to receive IPv4 address
   of the local mobility anchors that serve IPv4 hosts or when the
   transport network is IPv4.

   DNS servers send replies to SRV RRs with pmip6 service and ipv4
   protocol names as described in Section 3.2.  If only FQDNs are
   received then mobility access gateway makes another query to retrieve
   both A and AAAA address records associated with the local mobility
   anchors.  If address records are also included, DNS servers are
   RECOMMENDED to return IP addresses in AAAA and A records also in the
   SRV reply.

   DNS servers may also send replies to SRV RRs with pmipv6 service for
   any protocol name (ipv6 or ipv4) with dual-stack local mobility
   anchor FQDNs.  DNS servers may also add AAAA and A address records of
   such local mobility anchors in the same reply.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces a new service name for LMA discovery in
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 networks.  [RFC2782] requires that security
   considerations regarding this new service name be included.

   A host in Proxy Mobile IPv6 network referenced as a server in SRV RRs
   can be subject to denial of service attacks.  In this specification,
   SRV RRs are used by mobile access gateways and mobile access gateways
   are considered trustable in the same PMIPv6 domain.  Denial of
   service attacks can be a real issue if the mobile nodes in PMIPv6
   domain use SRV RRs to obtain local mobility anchor addresses and then
   propagate this address to the attackers.  This issue is similar to
   the denial of service attacts on the home agents and considerations
   presented in [RFC5026] apply here as well.
