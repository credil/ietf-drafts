Abstract

   Summoning emergency help by the public is a core feature of telephone
   networks.  This document describes how various IETF protocols and
   mechanisms are combined to place emergency calls.  This includes how

   these calls are routed to the correct Public Safety Answering Point
   (PSAP) based on the physical location of the caller, while providing
   the call taker the necessary information to dispatch a first
   responder to that location and to call back the caller if necessary.
   It describes at a high level how the pieces (recognizing a call as an
   emergency call, marking it as such, determining the location of the
   caller, routing the call based on location) go together, and
   references the Internet standards that define the details of these
   mechanisms.

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


1.  Terminology

   As a framework document, we do not define any new protocols or
   articulate new behaviors.  Thus we do not use RFC2119 [RFC2119]
   notation.  The following terms are used:
   (Emergency) call taker:  see [I-D.ietf-ecrit-requirements]
   ESRP (emergency service routing proxy):  see
      [I-D.ietf-ecrit-requirements]
   Access Network:  The network that supplies IP packet service to an
      endpoint.  In a residential or small business environment, this
      might be a DSL or cable modem or WiMax service.  In a large
      enterprise environment, this would be the enterprise network.  In
      a mobile environment, this might be a mobile (cellular) data
      network or a WiFi network.
   Location Configuration:  The process by which an endpoint learns its
      physical location.
   Location Conveyance:  The process of sending location to another
      element.
   Location Determination:  The process of finding where an endpoint is
      physically.  For example, the endpoint may contain a GPS receiver
      used to measure its own location.
   Location Information Server:  An element that stores location
      information for retrieval by an authorized entity
   Location Validation:  see [I-D.ietf-ecrit-requirements]
   Mapping:  see [I-D.ietf-ecrit-requirements]
   NENA (National Emergency Number Association):  A North American
      organization of public safety focused individuals defining
      emergency calling specifications and procedures.
   PSAP (public safety answering point):  see
      [I-D.ietf-ecrit-requirements]
   SIP B2BUA:  see [RFC3261]
   SIP proxy:  see [RFC3261]
   SIP Server:  see [RFC3261]
   SIP UA (user agent):  see [RFC3261]
   Stationary device (user):  An immobile user agent that is connected
      to the network at a fixed, long-term-stable geographic location.
      Examples include a home PC or a payphone.
   Nomadic device (user):  User agent that is connected to the network
      temporarily, for relatively short durations, but does not move
      significantly during the lifetime of a network connection or
      during the emergency call.  Examples include a laptop using an
      IEEE 802.11 hotspot or a desk IP phone that is moved from one
      cubicle to another.
   Mobile device (user):  User agent that changes geographic location
      and possibly its network attachment point during an emergency
      call.

2.  Introduction

   Summoning police, the fire department or an ambulance in emergencies
   is one of the fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone.
   As telephone functionality moves from circuit-switched telephony to
   Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that this core
   functionality will continue to work at least as well as it has for
   the older technology.  New devices and services are being made
   available which could be used to make a request for help which are
   not traditional telephones, and users are increasingly expecting them
   to be used to place emergency calls.  However, many of the technical
   advantages of Internet multimedia require re-thinking of the
   traditional emergency calling architecture.  This challenge also
   offers an opportunity to improve the operation of emergency calling
   technology, while potentially lowering its cost and complexity.

   It is beyond the scope of this document to enumerate and discuss all
   the differences between traditional (PSTN) and IP based telephony,
   but calling on the Internet is characterized by:
   o  the interleaving of signaling and media data packets;
   o  the interleaving over the same infrastructure of a wider variety
      of services;
   o  the separation of the access provider from the application
      provider;
   o  the plethora of different media that can be accommodated;
   o  potential mobility of all end systems, including endpoints
      nominally thought of as fixed systems and not just those using
      radio access technology.  For example, a wired phone connected to
      a router using a mobile data network such as EV-DO as an uplink;

   This document focuses on how devices using the Internet can place
   emergency calls and how PSAPs can handle Internet multimedia
   emergency calls natively, rather than describing how circuit-switched
   PSAPs can handle VoIP calls.  In many cases, PSAPs making the
   transition from circuit-switched interfaces to packet-switched
   interfaces may be able to use some of the mechanisms described here,
   in combination with gateways that translate packet-switched calls
   into legacy interfaces, e.g., to continue to be able to use existing
   call taker equipment.

   We distinguish an individual request for help, usually accomplished
   by dialing a short digit sequence like 9-1-1 or 1-1-2, from a call
   placed by specially designated persons who have authority to claim
   priority on available Internet communications facilities.  This
   document only discusses a request for help by an ordinary user
   answered at an emergency call center (i.e. a PSAP).

   Existing emergency call systems are organized locally or nationally;



Rosen, et al.            Expires January 9, 2008                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


   there are currently no international standards.  However, the
   Internet crosses national boundaries, and thus international
   standards for equipment and software are required.  To further
   complicate matters, VoIP endpoints can be connected through tunneling
   mechanisms such as virtual private networks (VPNs).  This
   significantly complicates emergency calling, because the location of
   the caller and the first element that routes emergency calls can be
   on different continents, with different conventions and processes for
   handling of emergency calls.

   The IETF has historically refused to create national variants of its
   standards.  Thus, this document attempts to take into account best
   practices that have evolved for circuit switched PSAPs, but makes no
   assumptions on particular operating practices currently in use,
   numbering schemes or organizational structures.

   This document discusses the use of the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) [RFC3261] by PSAPs and calling parties.  While other inter-
   domain call signaling protocols may be used for emergency calling,
   SIP is ubiquitous and possesses, through its related specifications
   the proper support of this use case.  Only protocols such as H.323,
   XMPP/Jingle, ISUP and SIP are suitable for inter-domain
   communications, ruling out MGC protocols such as MGCP or H.248/
   Megaco.  The latter protocols can naturally be used by the enterprise
   or carrier placing the call, but any such call would reach the PSAP
   through a media gateway controller, similar to how interdomain VoIP
   calls would be placed.  Other signaling protocols may also use
   protocol translation to communicate with a SIP-enabled PSAP.

   Existing emergency services rely exclusively on voice and
   conventional text telephony ("TTY") media streams.  However, more
   choices of media offer additional ways to communicate and evaluate
   the situation as well as to assist callers and call takers in
   handling emergency calls.  For example, instant messaging and video
   could improve the ability to communicate and evaluate the situation
   and to provide appropriate instruction prior to arrival of emergency
   crews.  Thus, the architecture described here supports the creation
   of sessions of any media type, negotiated between the caller and PSAP
   using existing SIP protocol mechanisms [RFC3264].  To ensure that,
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] recommends certain minimal capabilities in
   that call taker user agents and PSAP-operated proxies should possess.

   Supporting emergency calling does not require any new SIP header
   fields, request methods, status codes, message bodies, or event
   packages.  User agents unaware of the recommendations in this draft
   may be able to place emergency calls, but functionality may be
   impared.  For example, if the UA does not implement the location
   mechanisms described, an emergency call may not be routed to the

   correct PSAP, and if the caller is unable to supply his exact
   location, response may be delayed.  Suggested behavior for both
   endpoints and servers is provided


3.  Overview of How Emergency Calls are Placed

   We distinguish (Section 4) an emergency call from any other call by a
   unique Service URN[I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn], which is placed in
   the initial call set-up signaling when a home or visited emergency
   dial string is detected.  We route emergency calls based on the
   location ( (Section 5)) of the caller.  To get this location we
   either include a form of measuring (e.g.  GPS) ( (Section 5.3.3))
   device location in the endpoint, or the endpoint is configured (
   (Section 5.5)) with its location from the access network's Location
   Information Server (LIS) The location is conveyed ( (Section 5.6)) in
   the SIP signaling with the call.  We route( (Section 6)) the call
   based on location using the LoST protocol ( [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost])
   which maps a location to a set of PSAP URIs.  Each URI resolves to a
   PSAP or an Emergency Services Routing Proxy which serves a group of
   PSAPs.  The call arrives at the PSAP with the location included in
   the INVITE request.

                Figure 1: Generic ECRIT Component Topology

   Figure 2 shows a generic emergency call establishment.  This includes
   the following:
   o  Alice - who will make the emergency call.
   o  Configuration Servers - Servers providing Alice's UA its IP
      address and other configuration information, perhaps including
      Location by-value or by-reference.  In this flow, we use DHCP as
      an example location configuration protocol.  Configuration servers
      also may include a SIP Registrar server, for Alice's UA to
      register Alice's UA to register with.  Most SIP UAs will register
      with a call server, so it will be a common scenario for UAs that
      make emergency calls to be registered with such a server in the
      originating calling network.  Registration would be required for
      the PSAP to be able to call back after an emergency call is
      completed.  All the configuration messages are labeled M1 through
      M3, but could easily require more messages than 4 to complete.

   o  ESRP - The Emergency Services Routing Proxy Server that is the
      incoming call proxy in the emergency services domain.  The ESRP
      makes further routing decisions based on PSAP state and location
      of the caller to choose the actual PSAP which handles the call.
      In some jurisdictions, that may involve another LoST query
   o  LoST Server - Processes the LoST request for Location + Service
      URN to PSAP-URI Mapping function, either for an initial request
      from a UA, or an in-call routing by the Proxy server in the
      originating network, or possibly by an ESRP.
   o  PSAP - Call center where emergency calls are destined for in times
      of emergencies.

   Generally, Alice's UA either has location configured manually, has an
   integral location measurement mechanism, or it runs a location
   configuration protocol to obtain location from the access (broadband)
   network.  For most devices, a location configuration protocol will be
   used, for example a DHCPREQUEST message or another location
   acquisition mechanism.  Alice's UA then will most likely register
   with a SIP domain.  This allows her to be contacted by other SIP
   entities.  Next, her UA will perform an initial LoST Location-to-PSAP
   SIP(S)-URI query to learn a URI, for use if the Lost Query fails
   during an emergency call or to use it to test the emergency call
   mechanism.  The LoST query may contain the dial string for emergency
   calls appropriate for the location provided.

   Some time has hopefully passed since Alice's UA booted.  In this
   example, she dials or initiates an emergency call.  This may have
   been through her keypad with her locally known emergency dial string.
   It is important that this dial string be recognized by her UA
   wherever Alice is because she may be in enough distress she forgets
   what the traveled-to emergency dial string is; as there are more than
   60 around the world.

   The UA recognizes the dial string, which means this is an emergency
   call.  The UA attempts to refresh its location, and with that
   location, the LoST mapping, to get the most accurate information to
   use for routing the call.  If the location request or the LoST
   request fails (or takes too long) the UA uses it's cached values.

   The UA creates an INVITE which includes the location.
   [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance] defines a SIP Location header that
   either contain the location-by-reference URI, or a [RFC2396] "cid:"
   indicating where in the message body the location-by-value is.

   The INVITE message routes to the ESRP, which is the first inbound
   proxy for the emergency services domain.  This message, is then
   routed by the ESRP towards the most current PSAP for Alice's
   location, which uses PSAP state, location and other state information

   to choose this PSAP.

   A proxy in the PSAP chooses an available call taker and extends the
   call to its UA.

   The 200 OK to the INVITE traverses the path in reverse, from call
   taker UA to PSAP proxy to ESRP to originating network proxy to
   Alice's UA.  The ACK completes the call set-up and the emergency call
   is established, allowing the PSAP call-taker to talk to Alice about
   her emergency.

4.  Identifying an Emergency Call

   Using the PSTN, emergency help can often be summoned by dialing a
   nationally designated, widely known number, regardless of where the
   telephone was purchased.  The appropriate number is determined by
   which infrastructure the telephone is connected to.  However, this
   number differs between localities, even though it is often the same
   for a country or region, such as many countries in the European
   Union.  In some countries, there is a single digit sequence that is
   used for all types of emergencies.  In others, there are several
   sequences that are specific to the responder, e.g., one for police,
   another for fire.  It is deemed impractical to change the dialed
   digits to summon help.  For end systems, it is desirable to have a
   universal identifier, independent of location, to allow the automated
   inclusion of location information and to allow the device and other
   entities in the call path to perform appropriate processing within
   the signaling protocol in an emergency call set-up.

   As part of the overall emergency calling architecture, we define
   common emergency call URIs which are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn].  Users are not expected to "dial" an
   emergency URN.  Rather, the current dial string should be translated
   to the appropriate service URN.  Such translation could ideally be
   performed in the endpoint, but could be performed in a signaling
   intermediary (proxy server).  For devices that are mobile or nomadic,
   an issue arises of whether the home or visited dialing strings should
   be used.  Many users would prefer that their home dialing sequences
   work no matter where they are.  Local laws and preferences of the
   emergency response professionals are such that the visited dialing
   sequences must always work.  Having the home dial string work is
   optional.  The best answer seems to be for both to work.

   The mechanism for obtaining the dialing sequences for a given
   location is provided by LoST [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost].  Where the
   endpoint does not support the translation of dial strings to
   telephone numbers, the dialing sequence would be represented as a
   dial string [I-D.rosen-iptel-dialstring] and the outgoing proxy would
   recognize the dial string and translate to the service URN.  To
   determine the local dial string, the proxy needs the location of the
   endpoint.  This may be difficult in situations where the user can
   roam or be nomadic.  Endpoint recognition of emergency dial strings
   is therefore preferred.


5.  Location and Its Role in an Emergency Call

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


5.1.  Introduction

   Caller location plays a central role in routing emergency calls.  For
   practical reasons, each PSAP generally handles only calls for a
   certain geographic area (overload arrangements between PSAPs to
   handle each others calls notwithstanding).  Other calls that reach it
   by accident must be manually re-routed (transferred) to the
   appropriate PSAP, increasing call handling delay and the chance for
   errors.  The area covered by each PSAP differs by jurisdiction, where
   some countries have only a small number of PSAPs, while others
   decentralize PSAP responsibilities to the level of counties or
   municipalities.

   In most cases, PSAPs cover at least a city or town, but there are
   some areas where PSAP coverage areas follow old telephone rate center
   boundaries and may straddle more than one city.  Irregular boundaries
   are common, often for historical reasons.  Routing must be done on
   PSAP service boundaries, not "closest" or "best fit" algorithms.

5.2.  Types of Location Information

   There are four primary types of location information: civic, postal,
   geospatial, and cellular cell tower and sector.

   Civic:  Civic location information describes the location of a person
      or object by a street address that corresponds to a building or
      other structure.  (This is sometimes also called "civil" location
      information.)  Civic location may include more finely grained
      location information such as floor, room and cubicle.  Civic
      information comes in two forms:
      Jurisdictional -  This refers to a civic location using actual
         political subdivisions, especially for the community name.
      Postal -  This refers to a civic location used to mail a letter
         to.  The name of the post office sometimes does not correspond
         to the actual community name and a postal address may contain
         post office boxes or street addresses that do not correspond to
         an actual building.  Postal addresses are generally unsuitable
         for emergency call routing, but may be the only address
         available.
   Geospatial:  Geospatial addresses contain longitude, latitude and
      altitude information based on an understood datum (starting point)
      and earth shape model.  While there have been many datum developed
      over time, most modern systems are using or moving towards the
      [WGS84] datum.







Rosen, et al.            Expires January 9, 2008               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


   Cell tower/sector:  Cell tower and sectors identify the cell tower
      and the antenna sector that the mobile device is currently using.
      Traditionally, the tower location is expressed as a point, and
      routing decisions are made on that point.  Cell/sector information
      could also be transmitted as an irregularly shaped polygon of
      geospatial coordinates reflecting the likely geospatial location
      of the mobile device.

   In IETF protocols, civic and geo forms are both supported.  The civic
   forms include both the postal and jurisdictional fields.  The cell
   tower/sector can be represented as a point.

5.3.  Location Determination

   Location information can be entered by the user or installer of a
   device ("manual configuration"), can be measured by the end system,
   can be delivered to the end system by some protocol or can be
   measured by a third party and inserted into the call signaling.  We
   discuss these in detail below.

   In some cases, an entity may have multiple sources of location
   information, possibly partially contradictory.  This is particularly
   likely if the location information is determined both by the end
   system and a third party.  Handling multiple locations is discussed
   in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile].  Conflicting location
   information is particularly harmful if it points to multiple distinct
   PSAPs.  Guidelines for dealing with multiple locations is also given
   in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost].

   All location objects MUST be delivered to the PSAP.  Location
   information should contain information about the source of data, such
   as GPS, manually entered or based on access network topology.  In
   addition, the source of the location information should be included
   (PIDF "provided-by").  The ability of the UA to understand how it
   learned its location, and include this information element in the
   location object that is sent to the PSAP, provides the call-taker
   with many pieces of information to make decisions upon, and guidance
   for what to ask the caller and what to tell the responders.

   The call should indicate which location information has been used for
   routing, so that the same location information is used for all call
   routing decisions.  Otherwise, two proxies might pick different
   location information from the call request, resulting in different
   routing decisions for different transactions.  The location
   conveyance mechanism [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance] contains a
   parameter which can be used for this purpose

   End systems and network elements can derive location information from



Rosen, et al.            Expires January 9, 2008               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


   a variety of sources.  It is not the goal of this document to
   exhaustively enumerate them, but we provide a few common examples in
   the sections below.

5.3.1.  User-Entered Location Information

   Location information can be maintained by the end user or the
   installer of an endpoint in the endpoint itself, or in a database.

   Location information added by end users is almost always inferior to
   measured or wire database information, as users may mistype civic
   location information, may not know the meaning of geospatial
   coordinates or may use address information that does not correspond
   to a recognized civic address.  A user-entered location can fail to
   be changed when the location of a device changes during or after
   movement.  For example, a user could move their residence to another
   dwelling, not update their device/equipment with this new location,
   and place an emergency call with old location information.

   All that said, there are always a small number of cases where the
   mechanisms used by the access network to determine location fail to
   accurately reflect the actual location of the endpoint.  For example,
   the user may deploy his own WAN behind an access network, effectively
   remoting an endpoint some distance from the access network's notion
   of its location.  There must be some mechanism provided to provision
   a location for an endpoint by the user or by the access network on
   behalf of a user.  The use of the mechanism introduces the
   possibility of users falsely declaring themselves to be somewhere
   they are not.  As an aside, normally, if an emergency caller insists
   he is at a location different from what any automatic location
   determination system reports he is, responders will always be sent to
   the user's self-declared location.  However this is a matter of local
   policy and is outside the scope of this document.

5.3.2.  Access Network "Wire Database" Location Information

   Location information can be maintained by the access network,
   relating some form of identifier for the end subscriber or device to
   a location database ("wire database").  In enterprise LANs, wiremap
   databases map Ethernet switch ports to building layouts at known
   locations.  In DSL installations, the local telephone carrier
   maintains a mapping of wire-pairs to subscriber addresses.

   Even for IEEE 802.11 wireless access points, wire databases may
   provide sufficient location resolution; the location of the access
   point may be sufficient location information for each of the clients
   served by that access point.  However, this may not be true for
   larger scale systems such as IEEE 802.16 and IEEE 802.22 which



Rosen, et al.            Expires January 9, 2008               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


   typically have larger cells than those of IEEE 802.11.  A Wire
   database may be the source of location information for both
   residential users of DSL and Cable Modem installations, as well as
   the only infrastructure at a WiFi hotspot, such as a coffee shop.
   Each of these cases will have a known civic address of the dwelling/
   business, likely providing sufficient location resolution.  However,
   the civic location of an IEEE 802.16 base station may be of little
   use to emergency personnel

   Wire databases to the home are likely to be the most promising
   solution for residential users where a service provider knows the
   customer's service address.  The service provider can then perform
   address verification, similar to the current system in some
   jurisdictions.

5.3.3.  End-System Measured Location Information

   Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors may be embedded directly in
   the end device.  GPS produces relatively high precision location
   fixes in open-sky conditions, but the technology still faces several
   challenges in terms of performance (time-to-fix and time-to-first-
   fix), as well as obtaining successful location fixes within shielded
   structures, or underneath the ground (tunnels, basements, etc.).  It
   also requires all devices to be equipped with the appropriate GPS
   capability.  GPS technology is improving (e.g.  Galileo), and is
   increasingly successful in more difficult conditions such as dense
   urban canyons and inside commercial structures.  It is currently
   accurate to tens of meters using some kind of "assist", which may be
   operated by the access network (A-GPS) or by a government (WAAS).
   Newer multi-frequency systems will improve accuracy without assist.

   GPS equipped devices vary depending on which element initiates
   requests, which element actually determines final location, assist
   mechanisms, etc.  Some common implementations include:
   1.  GPS S/A (standalone), device initiated
   2.  GPS S/A, network initiated
   3.  AGPS-device initiated, network determined
   4.  AGPS-device initiated, network augmented
   5.  AGPS-network initiated, network determined
   6.  AGPS-network initiated, network augmented

5.3.4.  Third-party Measured Location Information

   Wireless triangulation:  Elements in the network infrastructure
      triangulate end systems based on signal strength, angle of arrival
      or time of arrival.  Common mechanisms deployed include.

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


      1.  Time Difference Of Arrival - TDOA
      2.  Uplink Time Difference Of Arrival - U-TDOA
      3.  Angle of Arrival - AOA
      4.  RF-Fingerprinting
      5.  Advanced Forward Link Trilateration - AFLT
      6.  Enhanced Forward Link Trilateration - EFLT
      Sometimes triangulation and measured mechanisms are combined, for
      example A-GPS with AFLT
   Location beacons:  A short range wireless beacon, e.g., using
      Bluetooth or infrared, announces its location to mobile devices in
      the vicinity.

5.4.  Location and References to Location

   Location information may be expressed as the actual civic or geo
   value but can be transmitted as by-value (wholly contained within the
   signaling message) or by-reference (a URI pointing to the value
   residing on a remote node waiting to be dereferenced).  There are
   pros and cons to each form:
   location-by-value:
      pro-  Value available to each device along the path immediately
         for further processing.
      con-  Size, especially if constrained to a UDP transport.  Value
         fixed at the time the value is acquired from the access
         network.  Value can be changed by the endpoint, which may be
         considered untrustworthy for this critical usage.
   location-by-reference
      pro-  Small size.  Value can be fixed at time of dereference.
         Value cannot be changed by endpoint
      con-  URI resolution requires location source be available and
         accessible by dereferencer.  Dereferencing takes time.
         Dereferencing may fail.

5.5.  End System Location Configuration

   Unless a user agent has access to provisioned or locally measured
   location information, it must obtain it from the access network.
   There are several Location Configuration Protocols (LCPs) that can be
   used for this purpose.

   DHCP  can deliver civic [RFC4676] or geospatial [RFC3825]
      information.  User agents would need to support both formats.
      Note that a user agent can use DHCP, via the DHCP REQUEST or
      INFORM messages, even if it uses other means to acquire its IP
      address.






Rosen, et al.            Expires January 9, 2008               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


   Insert reference to L7 acquisition protocol document>  is another
      choice.
   Link-Layer Discovery Protocol  [LLDP]), with proposed extensions
      [LLDP-MED], may also be used to deliver location information.
   SUPL  OMA <insert reference> is yet another choice.

   Other LCPs may be devised by other standards bodies.  Each LCP has
   limitations in the kinds of networks that can reasonably support it.
   For this reason, it is not possible to choose a single mandatory to
   deploy LCP.  For endpoints with common network connections (such as
   an Ethernet jack or a WiFi connection), unless every network
   supported every protocol, or alternatively, every device supported
   every protocol, serious incompatibilities would ensue.
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] contains a (short) list of protocols such
   devices must support.

   Where an access network can control the specification of EVERY
   endpoint that could make an emergency call that is directly connected
   to the network, or indirectly connected (for example, a device on a
   LAN behind a network attachment unit), it may specify any protocol it
   wishes for each endpoint.  This is a very unusual case; nearly every
   access network can be used to support an Ethernet based LAN behind it

   For example, existing mobile networks are being used to support
   routers and LANs behind a wireless data network WAN connection, with
   Ethernet connected phones connected to that.  It is possible that the
   access network supports a protocol not on the phonebcp list, and
   every handset supported in that network could use that protocol for
   emergency calls.  However, unless another element which the access
   network provider controls the specification of can acquire location
   using that protocol and then that element can support one of the
   phonebcp's list of protocols, the Ethernet connected phone won't be
   able to acquire location.  In this case, if the access network
   provider supplies a router which includes a DHCP server, it can
   acquire location using the access network specific protocol, and then
   use the location information to supply it to its clients (e.g. the
   Ethernet connected phone) via DHCP.

   For most networks, it will not be practical to control the
   specification of every device, or arrange interworking with network
   specific LCPs.  For this reason, most devices will need to support
   ALL of the LCPs in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost], and access networks will
   have to support at least one of these LCPs.

   Location for non-mobile devices is normally expected to be acquired
   at network attachment time and retained by the device.  It should be
   refreshed when the cached value becomes invalid (for example, if DHCP
   is the acquisition protocol, refresh of location may occur when the



Rosen, et al.            Expires January 9, 2008               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


   IP address lease is renewed).  At the time of an emergency call, the
   location should be refreshed, with the retained location used if the
   location acquisition does not immediately return a value.  Mobile
   devices may determine location at network attachment time and
   periodically thereafter as a backup in case location determination at
   the time of call does not work.  Mobile device location may be
   refreshed when a TTL expires, the device moves beyond some boundaries
   (as provided by [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost]), etc.  Normally, mobile
   devices will acquire its location at call time for use in an
   emergency call routing, but see Section 5.7

5.6.  Conveyance of Location

   When an emergency call is placed, the endpoint (normally) puts
   location information in the signaling with the call.  We refer to
   that as "conveyance" to distinguish it from "configuration".
   Configuration gets location from access network to endpoint,
   conveyance sends location from endpoint to elements that route the
   call based on that location object and the PSAP.  Using SIP, the
   location information is conveyed following the procedures in
   [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance].  The form of the location
   information obtained by the acquisition protocol may not be the same
   as the conveyance protocol uses (PIDF-LO [RFC4119]).  Mapping by the
   endpoint may be required.  Calling networks which support devices
   which do not support location may have to add location to emergency
   calls.  Some calling networks have relationships with the access
   network that may allow it to accurately determine location of the
   endpoint, although NATs and other middleboxes usually make it
   impossible to determine a reference identifier the access network
   could use to determine the location.

   For emergency call purposes, conversion of location information from
   civic to geo or vice versa prior to conveyance is not desirable.  The
   location should be sent in the form it was determined.  The PSAP may
   convert, if it needs to, and if conversion resulted from an earlier
   conversion, unacceptable errors may be introduced.

5.7.  Location Updates

   Location information may not be available at call setup time for
   mobile devices.  For example, if a GPS-enabled cell phone is turned
   on and then immediately places an emergency call, it can take
   significant additional time before the cell phone acquires a GPS fix
   and its location.  Thus, while it is desirous to base emergency
   routing on precise caller location information, it is not possible in
   all circumstances to do so.  In some cases, the initial call setup
   will proceed based on, for example, cell and sector information and
   then add location information during the call, rather than delaying



Rosen, et al.            Expires January 9, 2008               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


   the initial call setup by an unacceptable amount of time.

   In addition, the location of a mobile caller, e.g., in a vehicle or
   aircraft, can change significantly during the emergency call.  The
   PSAP must be able to get updated location information while it is
   processing the call.

   Location updates where the location is conveyed by value may be
   conveyed either in a re-INVITE or UPDATE [RFC3311] request message
   (where UPDATE is preferred) or the PSAP may subscribe to the location
   information of the caller, using SIP presence mechanisms RFC 3856
   [RFC3856]).  Authorization for subscriptions is for future study.
   When location is conveyed by reference, additional dereference
   operations yield updated location.

5.8.  Location Validation

   In some jurisdictions, location must be validated prior to a device
   placing an actual emergency call, and is always a recommended
   practice.  Validation in this context means both that there is a
   mapping from the address to a PSAP and that the PSAP understands how
   to direct responders to the location.  This is not as easy as it
   sounds.  There are, for example, many cases of two names for the same
   street, or two streets with the same name in a city.  In some
   countries, the current system provides validation.  For example, in
   the United States, the Master Street Address Guide (MSAG) records all
   valid street addresses and is used to ensure that the service
   addresses in phone billing records correspond to valid emergency
   service street addresses.  Validation is normally a concern for civic
   addresses, although there could be a concern that a given geo is
   within at least one PSAP service boundary; that is, a "valid" geo is
   one for which there is a mapping.

   The LoST resolver[I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost] includes a validation
   function.  Validation should ideally be performed when a location is
   entered into a Location Information Server (which is normally a
   provisioning mechanism in the access carrier's operation and support
   system).  It should be confirmed periodically, because the mapping
   database undergoes slow change; new streets are added or removed,
   community names change, postal codes change, etc.  Endpoints may wish
   to validate locations they receive from the access network, and will
   need to validate manually entered locations.  Proxies which insert
   location may wish to validate locations they receive from a LIS.
   Test functions (Section 13) should also re-validate.

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


5.9.  Default Location

   Occasionally, a failure may occur where the access network cannot
   determine the actual location of the caller.  In these cases, it must
   supply a default location.  The default location should be as
   accurate as the network can determine.  For example, in a cable
   network, a default location for each Cable Modem Termination System
   (CMTS), with a representative location for all cable modems served by
   that CMTS could be provided if the network is unable to resolve the
   subscriber to any unit less than the CMTS.  Default locations must be
   marked as such (how?) so that the PSAP knows that the location is not
   accurate.

5.10.  Uninitialized Devices and Location

   Support of devices that are not registered, and don't have valid call
   back identifiers is complex.  In some jurisdictions, for some
   services, support of emergency calls from so called "uninitialized"
   devices, for example, a mobile phone which does not have an active
   service contract in the United States is required to support calls to
   9-1-1.  It is attractive for such devices to be able to be used in an
   emergency.  However, the requirement to do so has caused a huge
   number of prank calls to the emergency service.  In some countries,
   it is common to attempt to place an emergency call from an
   unitialized device in the local bazaars to prove to a would-be
   purchaser that the phone works.  An unitialized device that can place
   an emergency call must supply location the same as a fully enabled
   device.


6.  Routing the Call to the PSAP

   Emergency calls are routed based on one or more of the following
   criteria expressed in the call setup request (INVITE):

   Location:  Since each PSAP serves a limited geographic region and
      transferring existing calls delays the emergency response, calls
      need to be routed to the most appropriate PSAP.  In this
      architecture, emergency call setup requests contain location
      information, expressed in civic or geospatial coordinates, that
      allows such routing.  If there is no or imprecise (e.g., cell
      tower and sector) information at call setup time, an on-going
      emergency call may also be transferred to another PSAP based on
      location information that becomes available in mid-call.

   Type of emergency service:  In some jurisdictions, emergency calls
      for fire, police, ambulance or mountain rescue are directed to
      just those emergency-specific PSAPs.  We support this mechanism by
      optionally labeling calls with a service identifier
      [I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn].
   Media capabilities of caller:  In some cases, emergency call centers
      for specific caller media preferences, such as typed text or
      video, are separate from voice systems.  Also, even if media
      capability does not affect the selection of the PSAP, there may be
      call takers within the PSAP that are specifically trained, e.g.,
      in interactive text or sign language communications.  Again, we
      use the caller capabilities [RFC3840] mechanism to label and route
      such calls.

   Routing for calls by location and by service is the primary function
   LoST [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost] provides.  LoST accepts a query with
   location (by-value) in either civic or geo form, plus a service
   identifier, and returns an xml data structure containing a URI (or
   set of URIs) to route the call to.  Normal SIP [RFC3261] routing
   functions are used to resolve the URI to a next hop destination.

   The endpoint can complete the LoST mapping from its location at boot
   time, and periodically thereafter.  It should attempt to obtain a
   "fresh" location, and from that a current mapping when it places an
   emergency call, and if accessing either its location acquisition
   function or mapping function fails, it should use this cached value.
   The call would follow its normal outbound call processing.  Networks
   that support devices that do not implement LoST mapping themselves
   would have the outbound proxy do the mapping.  The proxy must have
   the location of the endpoint, which is often difficult for the
   calling network to accurately determine.  The endpoint may have its
   location, but would not normally include it on the call signaling.
   There is no mechanism provided in [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance]
   to allow a proxy to require the endpoint supply location, because
   that would open the endpoint to an attack by any proxy on the path to
   get it to reveal location.  The Proxy CAN redirect a call to the
   service URN which, if the device recognized the significance, would
   include location in the redirected call.  All networks should detect
   emergency calls and supply default location and/or routing if it is
   not already performed.

   With the URI obtained from mapping, whether by the endpoint or the
   proxy, the proxy routes the call.  Normal SIP[RFC3261] mechanisms are
   used to route calls to the URI obtained from the LoST query.

   Often, the SIP routing of an emergency call will first route to an
   incoming call proxy in the domain operated by the emergency service.
   That proxy is called an "Emergency Services Routing Proxy" (ESRP).

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


   The ESRP, which is a normal SIP proxy server, may use a variety of
   PSAP state information, the location of the caller, and other
   criteria to onward route the call to the PSAP.


7.  Signaling of Emergency Calls

   As discussed above, location is carried in all emergency calls in the
   call signaling.  Since emergency calls carry privacy-sensitive
   information, they are subject to the requirements for geospatial
   protocols [RFC3693].  In particular, signaling information should be
   carried in TLS, i.e., in 'sips' mode.  While requiring TLS is
   actually the way the standards are written, it is unacceptable to
   have an emergency call fail to complete because a TLS connection was
   not created, for any reason.  In many cases, persistent TLS
   connections can be maintained between elements to minimize the time
   needed to establish them.

   The use of SIP Identity [RFC4474] to protect the headers of the
   message could improve end-to-end integrity of the information.

   Details of how location is carried in call signaling can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance].


8.  Caller Preferences

   SIP Caller Preferences [RFC3841] may be used to signal how the PSAP
   should handle the call.  For example, a language preference expressed
   in an Accept-Language header may used as a hint to cause the PSAP to
   route the call to a call taker who speaks the requested language.


9.  Including a Valid Call-Back Identifier

   The call-taker must be able to reach the emergency caller if the
   original call is disconnected.  In traditional emergency calls,
   wireline and wireless emergency calls include a callback identifier
   for this purpose.  In SIP systems, the caller should include a
   Contact header field indicating its device URI, if available, or
   possibly a GRUU[I-D.ietf-sip-gruu] if calls need to be routed via a
   proxy.  This identifier would be used to initiate call-backs
   immediately by the call-taker if, for example, the call is
   prematurely dropped.

   In addition, a call-back identifier should be included either as the
   URI in the From header field [RFC3261] preferably verified by SIP
   Identity[RFC4474].  This identifier would be used to initiate a call-



Rosen, et al.            Expires January 9, 2008               [Page 23]

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


   back at a later time and may reach the caller, not necessarily on the
   same device (and at the same location) as the original emergency
   call.  Both the Contact and From specific requirements are detailed
   in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp]

   Emergency authorities generally discourage support of unitialized
   devices (see Section 5.10.  If an uninitialized device does place an
   emergency call, some kind of call back URI must be provided.

   Finally, there may be two other call identifiers included in an
   emergency call.  An identifier may be included which can be used to
   identify the caller, as opposed to the device or the subscriber of a
   specific calling service.  This identifier may be used to retrieve
   information about the caller that is independent of calling service.
   For example, Alice may have home, office and mobile telephony
   services, but she is the same Alice in all of them.  Information
   about Alice may be kept by an entity independent of any telephony
   service provider.  The caller identity is a URI and is placed in a
   SIP Call-Info header [RFC3261] using the token "?" following the
   recommendations in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp].

   The communications service provider may also include an identifier
   that may be used to retrieve information specific to the call held by
   the service provider.  This identifier, also a URI may be placed in
   the Call-Info header using the token "?" per
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp].


10.  Mid-Call Services and Behavior

   A PSAP may need to REFER[RFC3515] a call to a bridge for
   conferencing.  The caller should also be prepared to have the call
   transferred (usually attended, but possibly blind) as
   per[I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples].

   While in a call, a number of other call features, such as call
   waiting, must be disabled.  This is also discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp].


11.  Call Termination

   It is undesirable for the caller to terminate an emergency call.
   Strategies for devices to handle caller attempts to terminate may be
   found in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp].  PSAP call termination is
   accomplished with normal SIP call termination procedures.

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


12.  Media

   PSAPs should accept media streams on RTP [RFC3550].  Traditionally,
   voice has been the only media stream accepted by PSAPs.  In some
   countries, text, in the form of BAUDOT codes or similar tone encoded
   signaling within a voiceband is accepted ("TTY") for persons who have
   hearing disabilities.  With the Internet comes a wider array of
   potential media which a PSAP should accept.  Using SIP signaling
   includes the capability to negotiate media.  Normal SIP offer/answer
   [RFC3264] negotiations should be used to agree on the media streams
   to be used.  PSAPs should accept real-time text [RFC4103].  All PSAPs
   should accept G.711 A law (and mu Law in North America) encoded voice
   as described in [RFC3551].  Newer text forms are rapidly appearing,
   with Instant Messaging now very common, PSAPs should accept IM with
   at least [RFC3428] as well as [RFC3920].


13.  Testing

   Since the emergency calling architecture consists of a number of
   pieces operated by independent entities, it is important to be able
   to test whether an emergency call is likely to succeed without
   actually occupying the human resources at a PSAP.  Both signaling and
   media paths need to be tested since NATs and firewalls may allow the
   session setup request to reach the PSAP, while preventing the
   exchange of media.

   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] includes a description of an automated test
   procedure that validates routing, signaling and media path
   continuity.  This test would be used at boot time, and whenever the
   device location changes enough that a new PSAP mapping is returned
   from LoST.  A manual operation for the test should also be possible.


14.  Example Call Flows

   TBD


15.  Alternatives Considered

   This is a non-normative appendix.  During discussions of emergency
   calling, a number of suggestions are commonly made.  Below, we
   discuss some of the reasons why these alternatives do not satisfy the
   requirements of emergency calling.






Rosen, et al.            Expires January 9, 2008               [Page 25]

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


15.1.  tel URIs

   Instead of providing URIs to call routing proxies or end systems, it
   has been suggested that end systems be configured with a "tel" URI
   [RFC3966].  Such a "tel" URI would have to be routed to a
   geographically appropriate telephony gateway, as it is unlikely that
   every building, enterprise or residence will have its own gateway.
   VoIP devices can be used in networks that are completely unaware of
   VoIP services, with VoIP service providers that are physically far
   removed from the caller's network location.  Thus, the use of a tel
   URI simply moves the problem to the outbound proxy, which has to use
   the caller's location to determine the appropriate telephony gateway.

   In addition, emergency telephone numbers are far from universal, with
   some such numbers used for non-emergency purposes elsewhere.  Thus,
   an outbound proxy would have to ascertain the location of the caller
   to guess whether the "tel" URI identifies an emergency call or some
   other number.

   Thus, "tel" URIs are not likely to be appropriate or sufficient for
   identifying emergency calls and do not, by themselves, solve the call
   routing problem.


16.  Security Considerations

   Connecting ANY service to the Internet creates threads to the service
   which did not exist before.  The emergency call service is especially
   critical compared to other services lately connected to the Internet.
   It must work reliably even in case of a major disaster when thousands
   of citizens call for help simultaneously.  Not only does the service
   need to be protected but also the liberties of the citizens who might
   need to use the service must be considered.

   The emergency service is an obvious target for a deliberate attack,
   and specifically a denial of service attack.  Mechanisms must be
   provided to help the emergency networks survive such attacks while
   continuing to provide service to genuine callers.

   Failure of any security mechanism should normally not prevent an
   emergency call to be established.  Unlike most systems, suspicious
   calls (that is, those where normal security mechanisms are not
   attempted or they fail to produce expected valid credentials) are
   normally not dropped, but are processed with the call taker made
   aware that the information given (location, for example), may not be
   accurate.  As the discussion in Section 5 shows, providing accurate
   location in the presence of a very wide variety of circumstances is
   challenging.  Exceptions may result in some of the security



Rosen, et al.            Expires January 9, 2008               [Page 26]

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


   mechanisms not being able to be deployed, and yet the information may
   be valid.

   When the emergency service is under deliberate attack, the policies
   on call acceptance may be changed.  More stringent compliance to
   security recommendations may be enforced, or at least calls with full
   security mechanisms in place may be processed before calls without
   them.

   The decision whether other security mechanisms should be tried or the
   call be dropped depends on the policy of the citizen, the policy of
   the call router and the policy of the PSAP and out of the scope of
   this document.

16.1.  Caller Authentication

   Fraudulent calls to PSAPs is a significant concern.  Current systems
   rely on inherent security mechanisms in the PSTN to make sure the
   identity of the owner of the telephone is known.  As Internet
   technologies are increasingly used to place calls, it is becoming
   easier to hide the identity of a caller.  Use of the SIP Identity
   mechanism [RFC4474] is recommended.  If SIP Identity cannot be
   provided, carriers should make use of P-Asserted-Identity, [RFC3325]

   In keeping with established customs in circuit-switched emergency
   calling, authentication cannot be made a prerequisite for routing or
   accepting an emergency call.  However, a call taker may be more
   suspicious of a caller and request additional information if the call
   authenticity cannot be verified.

16.2.  Location Privacy

   Location is sensitive information, it must be protected against
   disclosure to unauthorized persons.  In most jurisdictions placing an
   emergency call implies disclosure of location to all the entities
   needing location to properly route and respond to the call.
   Nevertheless, even in an emergency, callers have an expectation that
   their location will not be divulged outside of that implied release.

   During acquisition of the location information, an eavesdropper or
   impersonator may obtain location.  When DHCP is used, authentication
   [RFC3118] should be used to protect the location option.  Use of TLS
   in other LCPs should be used.  Similarly, TLS should be used with SIP
   signaling when location is conveyed.  However, failure to establish a
   security association should never be used to drop an emergency call.
   Rather, the operation should be attempted without the security
   mechanism.

Internet-Draft          Emergency Call Framework               July 2007


16.3.  PSAP Impersonation

   See Section 16.4.

   With LoST-based call routing (Section 6), an attacker could modify
   the mapping entries for one or more locations, re-routing calls
   destined for them.  The security mechanisms for provisioning the data
   in the LoST database must be robust.

   LoST is a distributed database, with many replicas of authoritative
   data.  An attacker may impersonate a valid LoST server and supply
   fraudulent data.  An attacker may also perpetrate a denial of service
   attack on LoST servers.  These issues are addressed in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost].

   Finally, the URI LoST returns would normally contain a domain name.
   The domain can be hijacked by several known attacks.  TLS should be
   used to place calls, with the domain name verified.  Using DNSSEC
   [RFC4033] on the DNS entries is recommended.  As above, failure of
   the security mechanism must not impede the processing of an emergency
   call; the operation should proceed without security rather than
   abandoning the call.

16.4.  Preventing Call Misdirection

   We need to prevent an emergency call reaching a destination other
   than a PSAP.  For example, a rogue UA able to intercept SIP requests
   might be able to impersonate a PSAP.

   In the absence of a globally recognized certificate that ensures that
   the owner is a legitimate PSAP, we rely on a chain of trust enforced
   by the 'sips' URI schema.  The 'sips' URI schema forces each SIP hop
   to route the call only to destinations supporting TLS transport.
   Each ESRP verifies that the next-hop destination chosen as described
   in Section 6 corresponds to the server certificate offered by that
   destination.

16.5.  Call Signaling Integrity

   Preventing a malicious outsider from manipulating call information in
   SIP requests can be assured by using "sips" (that is, TLS, hop-by-hop
   from caller to emergency call taker.

16.6.  Media Integrity and Confidentiality

   Media integrity and confidentiality can be assured by the use of
   SRTP[RFC3711].
