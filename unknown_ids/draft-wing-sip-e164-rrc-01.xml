    <abstract>
      <t>SIP lacks a mechanism to determine which domain can claim ownership
      of a certain telephone number. Due to this, it is impossible to
      establish meaningful identity or to authenticate endpoints that use
      telephone number URIs and domain names in their From address. This document proposes a
      solution to this problem using a return routability test.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC3261">SIP</xref> allows using both email-style
      addresses (user@domain) and telephone-style addresses (1234@domain). The
      latter is most often used with <xref target="ITU.E164.1991">E.164</xref>
      numbers (designated with ";user=phone") especially between different administrative domains.</t>

      <t>
<!--
As described in <xref
      target="I-D.elwell-sip-e164-problem-statement"></xref>, 
-->
SIP's use of
      E.164 numbers poses several problems. This draft provides a solution to
      one of the problems: determining if a domain name rightfully 'owns' an
      E.164 phone number. In order to do this, a new SIP request is routed
      towards that E.164 and, if it is received by the same domain, that
      domain is deemed to 'own' that E.164 number. This is termed a 'return
      routability check' (RRC).</t>

      <t>The return routability check relies on SIP routing to ascertain which
      domain 'owns' a certain E.164 number.</t>

<!--
      <t>The return routability check works through <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-sipping-sbc-funcs">session border controllers
      (SBCs)</xref> between the calling party and the called party, even if
      those SBCs modify the domain of the "From:" address to be their domain
      -- so long as they route the SIP return routability check (the SUBSCRIBE
      request) all the way to the domain that owns the E.164 number, and the
      originating domain sent their original request using an SBC-surviving
      signature <xref target="I-D.fischer-sip-e2e-sec-media"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="Operation">
      <t>In order to check if a domain actually 'owns' the E.164 number it
      claims to own, a new SIP request is sent towards that E.164. Upon
      receipt of a SIP request conaining an E.164 number in the From address,
      the verifying agent in the receiving domain sends a new, out-of-dialog
      request (a SUBSCRIBE) towards that E.164 using the verifiering domain's
      normal routing rules. This SUBSCRIBE contains a body (with a nonce) that
      the verifying domains wants the owner of the E.164 to sign. That SIP
      SUBSCRIBE request is routed to the 'owner' of that E.164. Upon receipt
      of the SUBSCRIBE, the owner of that E.164 number generates a NOTIFY
      request. This is signed, using RFC4474, and sent to the verifying
      domain. The verifing domain verifies the signature on the NOTIFY. If it
      verified, and if the same public key was used in the original SIP
      request and in this NOTIFY, the verifying domain has now verified the
      remote domain 'owns' that E.164 number. If a different public key was
      used in the original SIP request and in this NOTIFY, the verifying
      domain has no verified the remote domain does not own that E.164
      number.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-verifier-operation" title="Verifier Operation">
        <t>Upon receipt of an INVITE where the From: address contains a SIP
        URI with an E.164, a Verifier (as defined in <xref
        target="RFC4474"></xref>) needs to verify if the signer is authorized
        to sign for that domain. To do this, the Verifier has an additional
        task: it sends an out of dialog SIP SUBSCRIBE request containing a
        random nonce to that E.164, using the Verifier's default SIP routing
        rules for routing an E.164 address. The domain that owns the E.164
        will sign the nonce and send a NOTIFY request back.</t>

        <t>The steps the Verifier uses to perform this operation are:<list
            style="numbers">
            <t>Strip the domain name of the From: of the incoming INVITE. This
            results in a TEL URI. For example, "sip:+14085551234@example.com;user=phone"
            is rewritten to "tel:+14085551212".</t>

            <t>Rewrite the TEL URI to a SIP URI, following the Verifier's
            default routing rules. For example, if outgoing calls are
sent to the service provider example.net, then "tel:+14085551212" is
            rewritten to "sip:+14085551212@example.net;user=phone".</t>


            <t>Generate a random nonce.</t>

            <t>Using the SIP URI constructed in step (2), construct a SIP
            SUBSCRIBE message with Request-URI and To headers that use that
            SIP URI, and an "Expires" header of 0. The SUBSCRIBE contains the
            random nonce in its body as Content-Type
            application/return-routability-nonce.</t>

            <t>Send the SUBSCRIBE message. This will cause the calling party
            to send a NOTIFY.</t>
          </list>Upon receipt of the NOTIFY message, the Verifier performs the
        following steps:<list style="numbers">
            <t>Validate the <xref target="RFC4474"></xref> signature of the
            NOTIFY.</t>

            <t>Extract the application/return-routability-nonce from the
            NOTIFY, and compare it to the nonce that was sent in the
            SUBSCRIBE.</t>

            <t>Compare the certificate used to sign the NOTIFY is the same
            certificate used to sign the original SIP request that it is
            attempting to validate with this procedure.<list style="letters">
                <t>If they match, the E.164 return routability test has
                succeeded.</t>

                <t>If they do not match, the E.164 return routability test has
                failed.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-authentication-operation"
               title="Authentication Service or Calling Endpoint Operation">
        <t>The steps described in this section can be performed by the
        authentication service or by the calling endpoint.</t>

        <t>The authentication service or the calling endpoint, upon receiving
        a SUBSCRIBE for the return-routability event package, performs the
        following steps:<list style="numbers">
            <t>The SUBSCRIBE should be immediately acknowledged with a 200 Ok
            message.</t>

            <t>A NOTIFY should be immediately created, containing the same
            application/return-routability-nonce copied from the SUBSCRIBE.
            This NOTIFY contains a To and Request-URI which match the From of
            the SUBSCRIBE.</t>

            <t>This NOTIFY is sent.</t>

            <t>The RFC4474 authentication service, operating at the domain,
            will create a signature over the NOTIFY. This is used by the
            remote domain's verification service (see <xref
            target="sec-verifier-operation"></xref>).</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Performance Considerations">
      <t>To reduce SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY traffic, a verifier SHOULD cache
      successful and failed return routability checks. Successful checks will
      only become unsuccessful if SIP E.164 routing is changed to a different
      terminating domain. This only occurs when a domain relinquishes an
      E.164, so it is RECOMMENDED that the result of ssuccessful tests be
      cached for 24 hours. However, unsuccessful tests could be a result of
      misconfiguration and it is useful to re-verify such failures in the
      event the misconfiguration is fixed. Thus, it is RECOMMENDED that the
      result of unsuccessful tests be cached for 1 hour.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Deployment Considerations">
      <t>Intermediate SIP elements (proxies, SBCs, B2BUAs) MUST all forward
      the application/return-routability-nonce Content-Type.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-security-considerations"
             title="Security Considerations">
      <t>An attacker could cause a domain to perform public key operations by
      sending a bunch of bogus SUBSCRIBE messages. This can be thwarted by
      only responding with NOTIFYs if there is an active INVITE dialog.
      However, that could disclose information about active calls, and also
      restricts the usefulness of this feature to INVITEs. More evaluation of
      countermeasures against such an attack is needed.</t>
