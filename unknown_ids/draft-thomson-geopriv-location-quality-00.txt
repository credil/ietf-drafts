Internet-Draft              Location Quality               December 2007


1.  Introduction

   Location determination methods produce results of varying quality.
   In general, the quality of location information increases as the
   effort expended in generating the information increases.  This
   document provides XML extension objects that can be added to any
   protocol that provides location information.  These elements provide
   the ability to communicate location quality constraints to the
   location server.

   This document provides semantics, examples and security
   considerations for the HELD protocol
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery].  Application of the
   parameters described in this document are out of scope.

   Means for expressing the quality of location information is outlined
   in [I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty] and [GeoShape].  An entity
   requesting location information of an LS is unable to specify the
   quality of the location that it ultimately receives.  This is
   inefficient because an LS either provides location information that
   is inadequate for the intended task; or the LS could waste resources
   generating location information that is of eccessively high quality.

   This document describes an optional HELD parameter that communicates
   location quality constraints to an LS.  These constraints specify a
   desired uncertainty at a certain confidence, plus the maximum
   acceptable age where location information is stored.  Guidelines for
   deterministically evaluating location information against these rules
   are provided.

   [I-D.busin-geopriv-location-qos-req] describes some of the benefits
   of providing an LS with location quality constraints.  Location
   quality constraints provide information that an LS can use in
   deciding how to generate location information.  For example, an LS
   that is able to provide a location estimate with a sufficiently small
   uncertainty might be able to provide a response before the time
   indicated in the "responseTime".

   This document also provides a means by which the LS is able to
   indicate if the location quality meets the constraints.  These
   parameters can be used by a Location Recipient to ensure that the
   location is of adequate quality without requiring specific checking
   (although the PIDF-LO should include sufficient information to
   perform this check).  Response parameters are optional, and are also
   used to indicate that the LS has understood the location quality
   constraints.

   This document provides solutions that address a subset of the

   requirements in [I-D.busin-geopriv-location-qos-req].

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   Terms and procedures relating to uncertainty and confidence are taken
   from [I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty].  Familiarity with terminology
   outlined in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps] and [RFC3693] is also
   assumed.

   The term Location Server (LS) is used as a generic label.  From the
   perspective of this document, the LS could be a Location Information
   Server (LIS).  Similarly, the term Location Recipient (LR) is used to
   refer to the requester of location information, which could be a
   Device or Target for HELD.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Location Quality Operation

   Location quality parameters are provided by a Device or any other
   client of an LS in a location request message.  Figure 1 shows an
   example message.

     <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
       <locationType exact="true">geodetic</locationType>
       <quality xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lq">
         <maxUncertainty confidence="95">
           <horizontal>150</horizontal>
           <vertical>1000</vertical>
         </maxUncertainty>
         <maxAge>PT30S</maxAge>
       </quality>
     </locationRequest>

                                 Figure 1

   A LS that supports the location quality element uses the information
   contained in the request to choose how it serves the query.  The
   response to this message contains a quality indicator element that
   includes a list of the quality constraints that were met.  Figure 2
   shows a location response that includes a quality indicator.

     <locationResponse xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
       <presence xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf"
                 entity="pres:user@example.com">
         <!-- Actual location information omitted -->
       </presence>
       <qualityInd xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lq">
         maxUncertainty/vertical maxAge
       </qualityInd>
     </locationResponse>

                                 Figure 2

   A LS doesn't indicate the quality of the location estimate in the
   quality indicator; quality information is included in the PIDF-LO.
   The quality indicator provides notice to its recipient that the
   requested quality was provided.

3.  Location Quality Parameters

   This section defines the format and semantics of the location quality
   parameters for requests and the indication that is included with
   responses.

3.1.  Location Quality Request

   The "quality" element is included in a HELD request to indicate the
   constraints set by the Location Recipient (LR) on the quality of
   returned location information.  This document defines three elements
   that are included.

3.1.1.  Maximum Uncertainty

   The "maxUncertainty" element describes an upper limit on uncertainty
   at a given confidence.  Uncertainty is divided in to horizontal and
   vertical components.  Horizontal uncertainty is the maximum distance
   from the centroid of the area to the point in the shape furthest from
   the centroid on the horizontal plane.  Vertical uncertainty is the
   difference in altitude from the centroid to the point in the shape
   with the greatest altitude.

      Note: A LS MAY provide location information using the Point shape
      and indicate that the requested uncertainty is met providing that
      the LS has access to uncertainty information.  However, this is
      NOT RECOMMENDED since the recipient has no way of verifying the
      uncertainty.

   The "horizontal" and "vertical" elements are numerical values that
   contain a decimal value in meters.  Maximum uncertainty values MUST
   be greater than zero.

   A location estimate that does not contain uncertainty (i.e. a Point
   shape), never meets location quality constraints.  Where uncertainty
   is unknown, it MUST be assumed to be infinite at any non-zero
   confidence.  In particular, this applies to vertical uncertainty
   where the location estimate is two-dimensional only; location
   estimates without a vertical component of uncertainty never meet
   vertical uncertainty constraints.

   The "confidence" attribute of this element includes the confidence
   level (expressed as a percentage) that the uncertainty is evaluated
   at.  Confidence is set to a default of 95%.

   To evaluate uncertainty, the location estimate is first scaled so
   that the confidence of the estimate matches (or exceeds) the
   requested confidence.  The LS MAY convert the shape of the

Internet-Draft              Location Quality               December 2007


   uncertainty to a circle or a sphere prior to scaling to simply the
   scaling process.  For consistency, and contrary to the rules in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty], it is RECOMMENDED that a normal
   PDF be used for all except where confidence is reduced for a
   rectangular PDF.

   Horizontal uncertainty is evalulated by removing the altitude and
   altitude uncertainty components from the location estimate.  While
   removing altitude components from a location estimate might normally
   increase confidence, confidence MUST NOT be increased at this step;
   the confidence value has already been considered.  The shape is then
   converted to a circle, if it is not already in that shape.  The
   radius of the resulting circle is compared to the maximum horizontal
   uncertainty.

   Vertical uncertainty is evaluated for shapes that contain altitude
   uncertainty.  The value used for evaluating vertical uncertainty
   depends on the shape type: the vertical axis value for the Ellipsoid
   shape; the radius of the Sphere shape; half the height of the Prism
   shape.

   The LS MAY use location quality parameters to alter the way that it
   generates location information and to provide location information
   that more closely matches what is requested.  If maximum value is
   provided for vertical uncertainty, is is RECOMMENDED that the LS
   provide a location estimate that includes altitude and altitude
   uncertainty.  It is RECOMMENDED that the LS provide location
   information at the requested confidence, if possible.

3.1.2.  Required Civic Elements

   The "requiredCivic" element represents the requirements of an LR for
   uncertainty in civic address information.  An LR can specify the
   address elements that need to be present in the civic address in
   order for the location information to meet their quality
   requirements.

   The "requiredCivic" element contains a whitespace-separated list of
   element names.  These can be interpreted as XPath
   [W3C.REC-xpath-19991116] expressions that are evaluated in the
   context of the "civicAddress" element
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-revised-civic-lo].  These XPath statements are
   restricted to use of qualified names only (using the response
   document namespace context) and the "/" separator.  All child nodes
   of elements (including attributes and textual content) are treated as
   belonging to an element.

   Figure 3 shows an example request where an LR requires country, state

   (or equivalent) and post code civic address elements in the location
   information provided by the LS.

     <quality xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lq">
       <requiredCivic
           xmlns:ca="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr">
         ca:country ca:A1 ca:PC
       </requiredCivic>
     </quality>

                                 Figure 3

3.1.3.  Maximum Age

   Where location information is stored or cached, an LR can specify how
   long since the information.  This is particularly important if
   location information is generated in advance.  The "age" of location
   information is the taken as the time interval between the location
   information timestamp (the "timestamp" element in the PIDF tuple) and
   the time that the request is received by the LS.

   Location information that has greater age than requested SHOULD
   either be determined anew, or checked so that the timestamp can be
   updated.  If this value is set to zero (i.e.  "PT0S"), stored
   location information cannot be used.

3.2.  Location Quality Indication

   The "qualityInd" element contains a list of the quality constraints
   that the resulting location information meets.

   The list of constraints is represented as a whitespace-separated list
   of element names.  These can be interpreted as XPath
   [W3C.REC-xpath-19991116] expressions that are evaluated in the
   context of the original location quality request.  These statements
   follow the same constraints as the list of elements in Section 3.1.2.

   Where elements are nested, such as the "maxUncertainty" element, the
   outer element can be included to indicate an entire constraint is
   met; or, each individual child element can be identified.  Two
   equivalent indications are shown in Figure 4.

       <qualityInd xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lq">
         maxUncertainty
       </qualityInd>

       <qualityInd xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lq">
         maxUncertainty/horizontal maxUncertainty/vertical
       </qualityInd>

                                 Figure 4

   A LS that is unable to determine if a constraint MUST either omit the
   quality indication, or indicate that the constraint was not met.

   Two special values are added to the quality indication element for
   convenience.  The value "##all" indicates that all quality
   constraints were met (including any extensions).  The value "##none"
   indicates that none of the constraints were met.
