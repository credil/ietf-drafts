Abstract

   This document presents the CERNET IVI translation design and
   deployment for the IPv4/IPv6 coexistence and transition.  The IV
   stands for 4 and VI stands for 6, so IVI stands for the IPv4/IPv6
   translation.

   The IVI is a prefix-specific and stateless address mapping mechanism
   for "an IPv6 network connected to the IPv4 Internet" scenario.  In
   the IVI design, subsets of the ISP's IPv4 addresses are embedded in
   ISP's IPv6 addresses and these IPv6 addresses can therefore
   communicate with the global IPv6 networks directly and can
   communicate with the global IPv4 networks via stateless translators,
   which can either be IPv6 initiated or IPv4 initiated.  The IVI
   mechanism supports the end-to-end address transparency and
   incremental deployment.  This document is a comprehensive report on
   the CERNET IVI design and its deployment in large scale public
   networks.

Internet-Draft        CERNET IVI Translation Design            June 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document presents the CERNET IVI translation design and
   deployment for the IPv4/IPv6 coexistence and transition.  The IV
   stands for 4 and VI stands for 6, so IVI stands for the IPv4/IPv6
   translation.

   The experiences for the IPv6 deployment in the past 10 years strongly
   indicate that for a successful transition, the communication between
   IPv4 and IPv6 address families should be supported [JJI07].  However,
   the current transition methods do not fully support this requirement
   [RFC4213].  For example, dual-stack hosts can communicate with both
   the IPv4 and IPv6 hosts, but the single-stack hosts can only
   communicate with the hosts in the same address family.  The IPv4
   address depletion problem makes the dual-stack approach inapplicable
   [COUNT].  The tunneled architectures can link the IPv6 islands cross
   IPv4 networks, but they cannot help the communication between two
   address families [RFC3056] [RFC5214] [RFC4380].  The translation
   architectures can relay the communications for the hosts located in
   IPv4 and IPv6 networks, but the current implementation of this kind
   of architecture is not scalable and it cannot maintain the end-to-end
   address transparency [RFC2766] [RFC3142] [RFC4966] [RFC2775].

   Since IPv4 and IPv6 are different protocols with different addressing
   structure, the translation mechanism is necessary for the
   communication between the two address families.  There are several
   ways to implement the translation.  One is the stateless IP/ICMP
   translation algorithm (SIIT) [RFC2765], which provides a mechanism
   for the translation between IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers (including
   ICMP headers) without requiring any per-connection state.  But, SIIT
   does not specify the address assignment and routing scheme [RFC2766].
   For example, the SIIT uses IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses [::FFFF:ipv4-
   addr/96] and IPv4 compatible IPv6 addresses [::ipv4-address/96] for
   the address mapping, but these addresses violate the aggregation
   nature of the IPv6 routing [RFC4291].  The other translation
   mechanism is NAT-PT, which has serious technical and operational
   difficulties and IETF has reclassified it from proposed standard to
   historic status [RFC4966].

   CERNET stands for China Education and Research Network and it has two
   backbones using different address families.  The CERNET is IPv4-only
   and CERNET2 is IPv6-only [CERNET] [CNGI-CERNET2].  In order to make
   CERNET2 communicate with the IPv4 Internet, we designed IVI mechanism
   and installed IVI translators between CERNET and CERNET2.  It is
   clear that IVI fits in the "an IPv6 network connected to the IPv4
   Internet" scenario in the IETF behave Working Group definition
   [BEHAVE].

   The requirements of the IVI mechanisms are:

   1.  It should be stateless for the scalability.

   2.  It should support both IPv6 initiated and IPv4 initiated
       communications for the IPv6 servers in "an IPv6 network".

   3.  It should follow the current IPv4 and IPv6 routing practice
       without increasing the global routing table size in both address
       families.

   4.  It should be able to be deployed incrementally.

   5.  It should be able to use IPv4 addresses effectively due to the
       IPv4 address depletion problem.

   The IVI mechanism presented in this document can satisfy the above
   requirements.

3.  The IVI Translation Algorithm

   The IVI is a prefix-specific and stateless address mapping scheme
   which can be carried out by individual ISPs.  In the IVI design,
   subsets of the ISP's IPv4 addresses are embedded in ISP's IPv6
   addresses and these IPv6 addresses can therefore communicate with the
   global IPv6 networks directly and can communicate with the global
   IPv4 networks via stateless translators, which can either be IPv6
   initiated or IPv4 initiated.

   IVI mapping and translation mechanism is implemented in an IVI
   translator which connects between "an IPv6 network" to the IPv4
   Internet via ISP's IPv4 network as shown in the following figure.


            ------                        -----           ------
          /  The   \       -----        /  An   \       /  The   \
         |  IPv4    |-----|Xlate|------|  IPv6   |-----|  IPv6    |
          \Internet/       -----        \Network/       \Internet/
            ------                        -----           ------


                Figure 1: An IPv6 network to IPv4 Internet

   In order to perform the translation function between the IPv4 and
   IPv6, the translator needs to represent the IPv4 addresses in IPv6
   and the IPv6 addresses in IPv4.

   To represent the IPv4 addresses in IPv6, a unique, prefix-specific
   and stateless mapping scheme is defined between IPv4 addresses and
   subsets of IPv6 addresses, so each provider-independent IPv6 address
   block (usually a /32) will have a small portion of IPv6 addresses
   (defined by PREFIX), which is the image of the totality of the global
   IPv4 addresses, as shown in the following figure.  The SUFFUX are all
   zeros.

   To represent the IPv6 addresses in IPv4, each provider can borrow a
   portion of its IPv4 addresses and maps them into IPv6 based on the
   above mapping rule.  These special IPv6 addresses will be physically
   used by IPv6 hosts.  The original IPv4 form of the borrowed addresses
   is the image of these special IPv6 addresses, as shown in the
   following figure.  The SUFFIX can either be all zeros or for the
   future extensions.

3.1.  Address Mapping

   The IVI address mapping is defined based on individual ISP's prefix
   as shown in the following figure.


     | 0                 |32 |40                   |72             127|

   where bit 0 to bit 31 are the prefix of ISP(i)'s /32 (e.g.
   IPS6=2001:DB8::/32), bit 32 to bit 39 are all one's as the identifier
   of IVI, bit 40 to bit 71 are embedded global IPv4 space (IVIG4)
   presented in hexadecimal format. (e.g. 2001:DB8:ff00::/40).  Note
   that based on the IVI mapping mechanism, an IPv4 /24 is mapped to an
   IPv6 /64 and an IPv4 /32 is mapped to an IPv6 /72.

3.2.  Routing and Forwarding

   Based on the IVI address mapping rule, the routing is
   straightforward, as shown in the following figure.


    /-----\                                                     /-----\
   (ISP's  )  ----192.168.1.2  ------------- 2001:DB8::2----   (ISP's  )
   (IPv4   )--|R1|-------------|IVI trans. |------------|R2|---(IPv6   )
   (network)  ----  192.168.1.1-------------2001:DB8::1 ----   (network)
    \-----/                                                     \-----/


                           Figure 5: IVI Routing

   where

   1.  Router R1 has IPv4 route of IVI4(i)/k (k is the prefix length of
       IVI4(i)) with next-hop equals to 192.168.1.1 and this route is
       distributed to the Internet with proper aggregation.

   2.  Router R2 has IPv6 route of IVIG6(i)/40 with next-hop equals to
       2001:DB8::1 and this route is distributed to the IPv6 Internet
       with proper aggregation.

   3.  The IVI translator has IPv6 route of IVI6(i)/(40+k) with next hop
       equals to 2001:DB8::2.  The IVI translator also has IPv4 default
       route 0.0.0.0/0 with next hop equals to 192.168.1.2 .

   Note that the routes described above can be learned/inserted by
   dynamic routing protocols in the IVI translator neighboring (IGP) or
   peering (BGP) with R1 and R2.

   Since both IVI4(i) and IVI6(i) are aggregated to IPS4(i) and IPS6(i)
   in ISP(i)'s border routers respectively, they will no affect the
   global IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables [RFC4632].

   Since IVI translator is stateless, it can support multi-homing when
   same prefix is used.

   Since IVI can be implemented independently in each ISP's network, it

   can be incrementally deployed.

3.3.  Network-layer Header Translation

   IPv4 [RFC0791] and IPv6 [RFC2460] are different protocols with
   different network layer header format, the translation of the IPv4
   and IPv6 headers MUST be performed according to SIIT [RFC2765] as
   shown in the following figures.  Note that the source and destination
   address translation is based on the IVI address mapping algorithm,
   not the SIIT's definition.

3.4.  Transport-layer Header Translation

   Since the TCP and UDP headers [RFC0793] [RFC0768] consist of check
   sums which include the IP header, the recalculation and updating of
   the transport-layer headers MUST be performed.  Note that this is
   different from SIIT, since special IPv6 addresses (IPv4 mapped IPv6
   addresses and IPv4 compatible IPv6 addresses) are used in SIIT and
   results in checksum neutral property [RFC2765].

3.5.  Fragmentation and MTU Handling

   When the packet is translated by the IVI translator, due to the
   different sizes of the IPv4 and IPv6 headers, the IVI6 packets will
   be at least 20 bytes larger than the IVI4 packets, which may exceed
   the MTU of the next link in the IPv6 network.  Therefore, the MTU
   handling and translation between IPv6 fragmentation headers and
   fragmentation field in the IPv4 headers are necessary, which is
   performed in the IVI translator according to SIIT [RFC2765].

3.6.  ICMP Handling

   For ICMP message translation between IPv4 and IPv6, IVI follows the
   ICMP/ICMPv6 message correspondence as defined in SIIT [RFC2765].
   Note that the ICMP message may be generated by an intermediate router
   whose IPv6 address does not belong to IVIG6(i).  Since ICMP
   translation is important to the path MTU discovery, the inverse
   mapping for unmapped addresses is defined in this document.  In the
   current prototype, a pseudo IPv4 address is generated.  This prevents
   translated ICMP messages from being discarded due to unknown or
   private IP source.  A small IPv4 address block should be reserved to
   identify the non-IVI mapped IPv6 addresses.

3.7.  Application Layer Gateway

   Due to the features of 1-to-1 address mapping and stateless, IVI can
   support most of the existing applications, such as HTTP, SSH, Telnet
   and Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol.  However, some applications
   are designed such that IP addresses are used to identify application-
   layer entities (e.g.  FTP).  In these cases, application layer
   gateway (ALG) is unavoidable, but it can be integrated into the IVI
   translator.


4.  The IVI DNS Configuration

   The DNS [RFC1035] service is important for the IVI mechanism.

4.1.  DNS Configuration for the IVI6(i) Addresses

   For providing authoritative DNS service for IVI4(i) and IVI6(i), each
   host name will both have an A record and an AAAA record pointing to
   IVI4(i) and IVI6(i), respectively.  Note that the same name always
   points to a unique host, which is an IVI6(i) host and it has IVI4(i)
   representation via the IVI translator.

4.2.  DNS Service for the IVIG6(i) Addresses

   For resolving the IPv6 form of the global IPv4 space (IVIG6(i)), each
   ISP must provide customized IVI DNS service for the IVI6(i) hosts.
   The IVI DNS server is in dual stack environment.  When the IVI6(i)
   host queries an AAAA record for an IPv4 only domain name, the IVI DNS
   will query the AAAA record first.  If the AAAA record does not exist,
   the IVI DNS will query the A record and map it to IVIG6(i) and return
   an AAAA record to the IVI6(i) host.


5.  The Advanced IVI translation functions

5.1.  IVI Multicast

   The IVI mechanism can support IPv4/IPv6 communication of the
   protocol-independent specific-source sparse-mode multicast (PIM SSM)
   [RFC3171] [RFC3569] [RFC4607].

   There will be 2^24 group addresses for IPv4 SSM.  The corresponding
   IPv6 SSM group addresses can be defined as shown in the following
   figure.


          -------------------------------------------------------
          IPv4 Group Address          IPv6 Group Address
          -------------------------------------------------------
          232.0.0.0/8                 ff3e:0:0:0:0:0:f000:0000/96
          232.255.255.255/8           ff3e:0:0:0:0:0:f0ff:ffff/96
          -------------------------------------------------------


               Figure 8: IVI Multicast Group Address Mapping

   The source address in IPv6 MUST be IVI6(i) in order to perform
   reverse path forwarding (RPF) as required by PIM-SM.

   The inter operation of PIM-SM for address families IPv4 and IPv6 can
   either be implemented via the application layer gateway or via the
   static join based on IGMPv3 and MLDv2 in IPv4 and IPv6, respectively.

5.2.  Double IVI

   The IVI mechanism can support the double IVI service, i.e. a stub
   IPv4 network can be connected to an IVI translator to reach the IVI6
   network and via another IVI translator to reach the IPv4 Internet
   [RFC4925]

   A more interesting scenario is to integrate the functions of the
   first IVI translator into the end system.  In this case, the
   application software is IPv4 based and there is no need to have ALG
   support in the IVI translator when it is communicating with IPv4
   hosts.

5.3.  Using RFC1918 Address Blocks

   The private IPv4 address blocks [RFC1918] can be used as the IVI4.
   In this case, an IPv4 NAPT can be used to convert the public IPv4
   addresses to private IPv4 addresses and an IVI translator then
   translate the IPv4 packets to IPv6 packets.  Note that the resulting
   IPv6 addresses are not private addresses since they are embedded into
   globally routable IPv6 prefixes and this recovers the end-to-end
   connectivity in the IPv6 Internet for the networks using private IPv4
   addresses.

5.4.  IPv4 Address Temporal Multiplexing

   Due to the IPv4 address depletion problem, the effective use of the
   IPv4 address is important for the IVI mechanism.  The multiplexing
   techniques are temporal multiplexing and transport port multiplexing.

   The IVI6(i) can be temporally multiplexed inside the ISP(i)'s /32.
   This is to say that the ISP can dynamically assign IVI6(i) to an end
   system when it requests the IPv4 communication service and release
   the IVI6(i) when the communication is finished.

5.5.  IPv4 Address Transport-layer Port Multiplexing

   To further increase the utilization ratio of the public IPv4
   addresses, the port multiplexing can be used [RFC2766] [RFC4966].
   This is to say that a single IPv4 address IVI4(i) can be used for
   multiple IVI6(i) addresses under the condition that these individual
   IVI6(i)s host can only use a subset of the 65,536 port numbers.  For
   example, if the port multiplexing ratio is 128, each IVI6(i) can only
   use 512` concurrent port numbers to communicate with IPv4 Internet.
   The mapping mechanism is to use the SUFFIX in the IVI address mapping
   mechanism to define the coding method to the perform unique mapping
   between IVI4(i) and IVI6(i).  The specification of the SUFFIX coding
   method and the corresponding operation scheme will be presented in

6.  IVI Host Operation

6.1.  IVI Address Assignment

   The IVI6 address has special format (for example IVI4=202.38.114.1/32
   and IVI6=2001:250:ffca:2672:0100::0/72), therefore, the stateless
   IPv6 address auto-configuration cannot be used.  However, the IVI6
   can be assigned to the IPv6 end system via manual configuration or
   stateful auto-configuration via DHCPv6.

6.2.  IPv6 Source Address Selection

   Since each IPv6 host may have multiple addresses, it is important for
   the host to use an IVI6(i) address to reach the global IPv4 networks.
   The short-term work around is to use IVI6(i) as the default IPv6
   address of the host.  The long-term solution requires that the
   application should be able to select the source addresses for
   different services.


7.  The IVI Implementation

7.1.  Linux Implementation

   The IVI translation algorithm presented in this document is
   implemented in the Linux OS and the source code can be downloaded
   from [LINUX].  The example of the configuration is shown in Appendix
   A.

   The IVI DNS Configuration for the IVIG46(i) Addresses presented in
   this document can be downloaded from [DNS].

7.2.  Testing Environment

   The IVI translator based on the Linux implementation has been
   deployed between [CERNET] (IPv4-only) and [CNGI-CERNET2] (IPv6-only)
   since March 2006.  The pure IPv6 web servers using IPv6 addresses
   (IVI) behind IVI translator can be accessed by the IPv4 hosts [IVI4],
   and also by the global IPv6 hosts [IVI6].

   Two traceroute results are presented in Appendix B to show the
   address mapping of the IVI mechanism.

   The IVI6 manual configuration and the DHCPv6 configuration of the
   IPv6 end system have also been tested with success.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document presents the prefix-specific and stateless address
   mapping mechanism (IVI) for the IPv4/IPv6 coexistence and transition.
   The IPv4 security and IPv6 security issues should be addressed by
   related documents of each address family and are not included in this
   document.

   However, the specific security issues for the IVI translator
   implementation should be studied and addressed during the development
   of the IVI mechanisms.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This memo adds no new IANA considerations.

   Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
   correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are
   required, or if those assignments or registries are created during
   the RFC publication process.  From the author's perspective, it may
   therefore be removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor's
   discretion.
