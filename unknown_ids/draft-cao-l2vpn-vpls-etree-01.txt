Abstract

   This document proposes an approach to support Metro Ethernet Forum
   (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) in Virtual Private LAN Service [RFC4761]
   [RFC4762]. The proposed solution is characterized by breaking
   pseudowire setup between Leaf endpoints to fulfill the specific E-
   Tree requirement: Leaf cannot communicate with Leaf. Backward
   compatibility is also considered in this document.

1. Introduction

   A specific Rooted-multipoint service, Ethernet Tree (E-Tree), has
   been defined by Metro Ethernet Forum [MEF6.1]. Unlike MEF Ethernet
   LAN (E-LAN) service where there is no communication restriction
   between its attachment circuits, each attachment circuit of an E-tree
   instance is designated as either a Root or a Leaf. A Root-AC can
   communicate with all other attachment circuit in an E-Tree instance,
   however a Leaf-AC can only communicate with Root-ACs but not Leafs.

   In VPLS application [RFC4761] [RFC4762], the attachment circuits can
   be thought of as LAN interfaces that attach to "virtual LAN switches",
   and each attachment circuit in a VPLS instance is equivalent to the
   others, therefore the VPLS instance requires that a single pseudowire
   is established between each pair of VSIs that are in same VPLS.
   [RFC6074] proposed Partial Mesh with a set of "import RTs" and
   "export RTs", but cannot fully meet the functional requirements in
   [Draft VPLS ETree Req]. In an E-Tree, the attachment circuits SHOULD
   be distinguished between Roots and Leafs and it MAY have several
   Roots and several Leafs. Figure 1 below shows scenario for Leaf-to-
   Leaf communication restriction between PE1 and PE2 which have both
   Root and Leaf in an E-Tree:

         Figure 1 Leaf-to-Leaf communication restriction in E-Tree

   -  Like A. 8 in [Draft ETree Frwk], a VSI on PE1 or PE2 in an E-Tree
      has two members, one is composed of all Root attachment circuits
      and called Root endpoint, and another is composed of all Leaf
      attachment circuits and called Leaf endpoint. The maximum Root
      endpoint or Leaf endpoint in a VSI on any PE is 1.

   -  3 Ethernet pseudowires are established between the VSI of PE1 and
      the VSI of PE2 in Figure 1, where Ethernet PW1 is established for
      communication between Root endpoint of PE1 and Root endpoint of
      PE2, Ethernet PW2 is established for communication between Root
      endpoint of PE1 and Leaf endpoint of PE2, and Ethernet PW3 is
      established for communication between Leaf endpoint of PE1 and
      Root endpoint of PE2. There is no pseudowire between Leaf
      endpoints.

   -  If PE2 transmits a frame from Root AC3, if it is unicast known, it
      will forward to the corresponding PW upon MAC address learning; If
      PE2 transmits an unicast unknown or broadcast from Root AC, it
      will transmit it via PW2 and PW3, in this case PE1 will receive
      two copies and forward them to Root AC and Leaf AC respectively.
      Section 6. in this document will improve this in data plane.

   -  If PE2 receives a frame from PW2, for example, it will forward it
      to its Root AC directly; if PE2 receives one frame from PW3, it
      will forward to its Leaf AC directly since the frame comes from
      Root AC of PE1. There is no communication between Leaf AC of PE1
      and Leaf AC of PE2 since there is no pseudowire between them.

   The functional requirements for MEF E-Tree support in VPLS can be
   found in [Draft VPLS ETree Req].

Internet-Draft                   Extension to signaling in VPLS for E-Tree   December 2011


   This document presents a minimal extension to the current VPLS
   standard [RFC4761] [RFC4762] on control plane to break the
   "communication channel" between Leaf attachment circuits.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

3. Terminology

   There are two solutions to restrict Leaf-to-Leaf communication:

        1. Restriction on data plane: Each frame carries additional
           information to indicate that it is originated from a Leaf AC
           or Root AC on the ingress PE, egress PE will know forward
           behavior of the frame: if it comes from Leaf, it will NOT be
           forwarded to its local Leaf ACs. There is no change on
           control plane and [Draft Ext VPLS for ETree] proposes this
           solution.

        2. Restriction on control plane: Here Leaf-to-Leaf communication
           restriction includes two cases,

         o  Restriction between local Leafs. If two leafs are bound to a
         PE in a VSI and that PE receives a frame from one local Leaf,
         it does not forward it to other local Leafs. This restriction
         is local forwarding behavior and out of the scope of this
         document.

         o  Restriction between local Leafs and remote Leafs, say AC2 of
         PE1 and AC4 of PE2 in Figure 1. If there is no pseudowire
         between AC2 of PE1 and AC4 of PE2, communication between AC2
         and AC4 is natively forbidden.

   The purposed solution in this document prefers to the second one and
   extends control plane for both [RFC4761] and [RFC4762].

   This document introduces two terms,

   -  Root-endpoint. Root endpoint is bound to a set of Root-ACs. In a
      VSI on any PE has no or only 1 Root-endpoint.

Internet-Draft                   Extension to signaling in VPLS for E-Tree   December 2011


   -  Leaf-endpoint. Leaf endpoint is bound to a set of Leaf-ACs. In a
      VSI on any PE has no or only 1 Leaf-endpoint.

   There is no endpoint which is bound to both Root-ACs and Leaf-ACs in
   this document. Each endpoint is designated endpoint identifier.  As a
   simple example, two endpoint identifiers are designated for PE1 in
   Figure 1, say r for Root AC AC1 and l for Leaf AC AC2, but r and l
   belong to the same E-Tree.

4. Reference Model

   Figure 2 below shows 3 PE types: Root-Leaf-AC-Mixed PE (PE1), Leaf-
   AC-only PE (PE2) and Root-AC-only PE (PE3). PE1, PE2 and PE3 are in
   an E-Tree instance. In Figure 2, Root ACs {AC1, AC5, AC6} can
   communicate with all other Ethernet ACs in the E-Tree, Leaf ACs {AC2,
   AC3, AC4} only can communicate with Root ACs {AC1, AC5, AC6}, and
   Leaf ACs can not communicate with each other.

   In most use cases, an E-Tree has only several Root ACs but many Leaf-
   ACs. The procedures for creating an E-Tree instance are given below:

   -  Root-Leaf-AC-Mixed PE. Some connected to VSI are Root ACs and some
      are Leaf ACs, say AC1 and AC2 of PE1 in Figure 2. Here two
      endpoint identifiers are designated to PE1, one is called Root-
      endpoint r1, and one is called Leaf-endpoint l1. Both r1 and l1
      belong to VSI in an E-Tree, and Root AC (AC1) is bound to r1 and
      Leaf AC is bound to l1;

   -  Leaf-AC-only PE. All ACs connected to VSI are Leaf ACs, say AC3
      and AC4 of PE2 in Figure 2. One endpoint identifier l2 is
      designated to PE2 and two Leaf-ACs (AC3 and AC4) are bound to l2.

   -  Root-AC-only PE. All ACs connected to VSI are Root ACs, say AC5
      and AC6 of PE3 in Figure 2. One endpoint identifier r3 which is
      designated to PE3 and two Root-ACs (AC5 and AC6) are bound to r3.

   Within an E-Tree,

   -  Fully comply with current VPLS application [RFC4761] [RFC4762]:
      Endpoint identifier is unique identifier in E-Tree domain. For
      BGP-VPLS the endpoint identifier is VE ID carried in NLRI, but for
      LDP-VPLS it can be taken as attachment identifier (AI).

   -  All attachment circuits of a Root endpoint can receive frames from
      and transmit frames to ACs of any other endpoints in an E-Tree
      upon MAC address learning.

   -  Any attachment circuit of a Root endpoint can receive frames from
      and transmit frames to other Root-ACs in its own domain upon MAC
      address learning;

   -  All attachment circuits of a Leaf endpoint can receive frames from
      and transmit frames to ACs of any Root endpoints in an E-Tree upon
      MAC address learning.

   -  Any attachment circuit of a Leaf endpoint cannot receive frames
      from and transmit frames to any attachment circuit of other Leaf
      endpoints in the E-Tree.

   -  Any attachment of a Leaf endpoint cannot receive frames from and
      transmit frames to any other attachment circuit in its domain;

   Therefore in Figure 2,

   -  All endpoint identifiers are designated by network administrator:

        1. r1 for PE1's Root endpoint which  AC1 (Root AC) is bound to;
           l1 for PE1's Leaf endpoint which AC2 (Leaf AC) is bound to;

        2. l2 for PE2's Leaf endpoint which is AC3 and AC4 (Leaf ACs)
           are bound to.

        3. r3 for PE3's Root endpoint which AC5 and AC6 (Root ACs) are
           bound to;

   -  PE1 establishes one pseudowire (PW12) between r1 and l2, but does
      not establish any pseudowire between l1 and l2;

   -  PE1 establishes two pseudowires with PE3 where PW13-1 between r1
      and r3, PW13-2 between l1 and r3;

   -  PE2 has one Leaf endpoint, so PE2 establish one pseudowire (PW12)
      between l2 and r1 with PE1, and one pseudowire (PW23) between l2
      and r3 with PE3;

   -  PE3 establishes two pseudowires with PE1 where PW13-1 between r3
      and r1, and PW13-2 between r3 and l1;

   -  On Root-Leaf-Mixed PE, say on PE1, Leaf AC and Root AC belong to
      different endpoints where AC1 belongs to r1 and AC2 belongs to l1.
      Any attachment circuit of Leaf endpoint can receive frame from or
      transmit frame to any attachment circuit of local Root endpoint,
      and vice versa.

   -  On Leaf-only PE, say PE2, communication between local Leafs of
      Leaf endpoint, l2, is forbidden.

   -  On Root-only PE, say PE3, communication between local Root-ACs of
      Root endpoint, r2, is allowed.

   This applies to all traffic, including Unicast Known, Unicast Unknown,
   Broadcast or Multicast.

5. Extension to VPLS for E-Tree

5.1. Assumptions

   In current VPLS application [RFC4761] [RFC4762], the PEs are assumed
   to be (logically) fully meshed with tunnels over which packets that
   belong to a service (such as VPLS) are encapsulated and forwarded,
   therefore one Single Bidirectional Pseudowire is created between
   every two PEs in one VPLS. In an E-Tree, one or more pseudowires are
   created between every two PEs since one PE MAY have 1 or 2 OR MORE
   endpoints with proposed solution in this document.

   Any E-Tree endpoint comprises only one AC type. If a PE in a VPLS has
   both Root ACs and Leaf ACs, it SHOULD be configured with at least two
   endpoints, one is only composed of Root ACs, and another is only
   composed of Leaf ACs. It is illegal for any endpoint to have both at
   same time.

5.2. PW setup Matrix

   Just as mentioned in Section 3, there is no PW between Leaf-endpoints.
   Table 1 describes PW setup matrix,

   For example, between PE1 and PE2 in Figure 1, we have to setup 3 PWs,

   -  PW 1: Communication between Root ACs, i.e., AC 1 and AC 3 in
      Figure 1.

   -  PW 2: Communication between Root AC and Leaf AC, i.e., AC 1 and AC
      4 in Figure 1.

   -  PW 3: Communication between Root AC and Leaf AC, i.e., AC 2 and AC
      3 in Figure 1.

5.3. Endpoint type

   Each endpoint in an E-Tree on PE MUST have an attribute, Root
   endpoint or Leaf endpoint. For backward compatibility, the default
   endpoint type MUST be Root for current VPLS standard [RFC4761]
   [RFC4762].

   -  Root endpoint. One of its attachment circuits can communicate with
      other attachment circuits in its domain or attachment circuits of
      other endpoints.

   -  Leaf endpoint. Its attachment circuits only can communicate with
      all attachment circuits of Root endpoints in a VPLS or E-Tree.

5.4. Endpoint identifier designation

     5.4.1. Endpoint identifier designation using LDP FEC 128

   Endpoint identifier is designated by network administrator and unique
   identifier in an E-Tree domain. Endpoint identifier is locally
   significant identifier and not exchanged among PEs via LDP signaling.

     5.4.2. Endpoint identifier designation using LDP FEC 129

   Endpoint identifier is designated by network administrator and unique
   identifier in an E-Tree domain. Endpoint identifier is locally
   significant identifier and not exchanged among PEs via LDP signaling.

     5.4.3. Endpoint identifier exchange using BGP

   Section 3.2.2 in [RFC4761] defines VPLS BGP NLRI with a new AFI and
   SAFI to exchange VPLS membership and demultiplexors.

                  Figure 3 BGP NLRI for VPLS Information

   Endpoint identifier is unique identifier in E-Tree domain, and has
   same signification as VE ID in Figure 3. A PE participating in an E-
   Tree must have at least one endpoint identifier, but for a VSI on a
   PE which has both Root-ACs and Leaf-ACs, at least two endpoint
   identifiers are designated, one is called Root endpoint and one is
   called Leaf endpoint. Each endpoint in an E-Tree SHOULD be assigned
   one type, Root or Leaf. If not assigned, the default type is Root.

   The whole VE ID set is divided into two parts, one is Root VE ID set
   R, one is Leaf VE id set L and whole VE ID set is V.

       L = {l1, l2, ......, ln},

       R = { r1, r2,......, rm},

       V = { VBO, VBO+1,......, VBO+VBS-1},

   Where,

      - L and R is subset of V;

      - Intersection of two sets L and R is empty set;

      - Union of two sets L and R is V;

   VE ID and VE Block Size (VBS) are typically assigned by the network
   administrator. All Root VE IDs are in R set, and all Leaf VE IDs are
   in L set.

   The endpoint which is identified by VE ID in L set only can establish
   PW with the endpoint identified by VE ID in R set, but the endpoint

   carry endpoint type information. This TLV MUST only be used when
   sending the PW id FEC.

   Initial Pseudowire Interface Parameter Sub-TLV type allocations are

   Notes that endpoint identifier is NOT the PW identifier.

5.5.1.2. Extension to the Generalized FEC 129

   Generalized PWid FEC Element uses Attachment Identifiers (AI) to
   indicate forwarders, and an Attachment Identifier would consist of an
   Attachment Group Identifier (AGI) plus an Attachment Individual
   Identifier (AII). An Attachment Individual Identifier may be thought
   of as endpoint identifier in this document.

     5.5.2. Signaling endpoint type using BGP

   The extended attribute defined in Section [RFC4761] 3.2.4, the
   "Layer2 Info Extended Community", is used to signal control
   information about the pseudowires to be setup for a VPLS, where
   Control Flags (control information regarding the pseudowires) is used
   to carry endpoint type information.

           Root type.

5.6. PW setup and teardown

     5.6.1. Signaling procedures using LDP FEC 128

   Using the PW id FEC, each of the two pseudowire endpoints
   independently initiates the setup of a unidirectional LSP.  An
   outgoing LSP and an incoming LSP are bound together into a single
   pseudowire if they have the same PW ID and PW type and meet PW setup
   Matrix in 5.2.

     5.6.2. Signaling procedures using the Generalized FEC 129

   Suppose PE-a and PE-b are parts of E-Tree foo. PE-a mush know the
   address of remote PE-b and vice versa. This information may be
   configured at PE1 and PE2, or may have been learned via autodiscovery
   mentioned in [RFC6074].

Internet-Draft                   Extension to signaling in VPLS for E-Tree   December 2011


   1. PE-a initiates the setup by sending a Label Mapping Message to PE-
      b. The Label Mapping message contains the FEC TLV, carrying the
      Generalized PWid FEC Element (type 0x81).  The Generalized PWid
      FEC element contains the AGI, SAII (local endpoint identifier),
      TAII information (remote endpoint identifier) and local endpoint
      type in interface parameters TLV.

   2. When PE2-b receives such a Label Mapping message, PE-b interprets
      the message as a request to set up a PW whose endpoint (at PE-b)
      is the Forwarder identified by the TAI, and the AGI could be a
      VPN-id, identifying a particular VPLS instance. If PE-b cannot map
      the TAI to one of its Forwarders, then PE2 sends a Label Release
      message to PE1, with a Status Code of "Unassigned/Unrecognized
      TAI"; If PE-b can not meet PW setup Matrix in 5.2. , then PE2
      sends a Label Release message to PE1, with a Status Code of
      "Mismatch endpoint type"; then processing of the Label Mapping
      message is complete.

   3. If PE-b decides to accept the Label Mapping message, then it has
      to make sure that a PW LSP is set up in the opposite (PE-a-->PE-b)
      direction. If it has already signaled for the corresponding PW LSP
      in that direction, nothing more needs to be done.  Otherwise, it
      must initiate such signaling by sending a Label Mapping message to
      PE-a. This is very similar to the Label Mapping message PE-b
      received, but the SAI and TAI are reversed.

   Thus, a bidirectional PW is established. Refer to [RFC4447] for PW
   teardown process.

     5.6.3. Signaling using BGP

   Suppose PE-a is part of E-Tree foo and has both Root endpoint and
   Leaf endpoint. For Leaf endpoint, it is assigned with VE ID l which
   is in Leaf VE ID set, VE block offset VBO, VE Block Size VBS, and
   label base lLB, For Root endpoint, it is assigned with VE ID r which
   is in Root VE ID set, VE Block Offset VBO, VE Block Size VBS, and
   label base rLB which is equal to lLB. If PE-b is also part of E-Tree
   foo with VE ID w (Root or Leaf, not care) and gets NLRI advertisement
   from PE-a, it will do the following according to [RFC4761] section
   3.2.3,

5.6.3.1. Originated from Root endpoint

   Supposed PW setup is originated from Root endpoint r. Checks if w is
   part of PE-a's 'remote VE set': if VBO <= w < VBO+ VBS, then w is
   part of PE-a's remote VE set. If not, PE-b ignores this message, and
   skips the rest of this procedure;

   1. Since remote endpoint is Root, PW establishment is allowed and
      sets up a PW to PE-a: the demultiplexor label to send traffic from
      PE-b to PE-a is computed as (rLB + w - VBO).

   2. Checks if r is part of any 'remote VE set' that PE-b announced,
      i.e., checks if r belongs to some remote VE set that PE-b
      announced, say with VE Block Offset VBO', VE Block Size VBS', and
      label base LB'.  If not, PE-b MUST make a new announcement as
      described.

   3. Sets up a PW from PE-a: the demultiplexor label over which PE-b
      should expect traffic from PE-a is computed as: (LB' + r - VBO').

   If PE-a withdraws an NLRI for r that PE-b was using, then PE-b MUST
   tear down its ends of the pseudowire between r of PE-a and w of PE-b.

5.6.3.2. Originated from Leaf endpoint

   1. Checks if w is Leaf endpoint with local "Layer2 Info Extended
      Community". If it is, PE-b ignores this message since remote
      endpoint l is Leaf, and skips the rest of this procedure.

   2. Checks if w is part of PE-a's 'remote VE set': if VBO <= w < VBO+
      VBS, then w is part of PE-a's remote Root VE set.  If not, PE-b
      ignores this message, and skips the rest of this procedure.

   3. Sets up a PW to PE-a: the demultiplexor label to send traffic from
      PE-b to PE-a is computed as (lLB + w - VBO).

   4. Checks if l is part of any 'remote VE set' that PE-b announced,
      i.e., PE-b checks if l belongs to some remote VE set that PE-b
      announced, say with VE Block Offset VBO', VE Block Size VBS', and
      label base LB'. If not, PE-b MUST make a new announcement as
      described.

   5. Sets up a PW from PE-a: the demultiplexor label over which PE-b
      should expect traffic from PE-a is computed as: (LB' + l - VBO').

   If PE-a withdraws an NLRI for l that PE-b was using, then PE-b MUST
   tear down its ends of the pseudowire between PE-a and PE-b.

5.7. Backward Compatibility

   Root endpoints and Leaf endpoints are used only in cases where PEs
   support E-Tree and have no impact on VPLS PEs already in operation.

   In a case where a common VPLS is composed of both PEs supporting the
   solution and PEs not supporting it, ACs attached to PEs which don't
   support E-tree are taken as attachment circuits of Root endpoints.
   The Leaf-to-Leaf communication restriction will be implemented within
   the scope of the compliant PEs.

6. Extension to Data Plane for E-Tree

   Refer to Figure 1, two VE IDs are assigned to PE1, say r1 and l1; two
   VE IDs are assigned to PE2, say r2 and l2. Following PW setup matrix
   in 5.2. there are 3 bidirectional PWs between PE1 and PE2,

   -  PW 1 between r attached to AC 1 and r2 attached to AC 2. On side
      of PE1, PW is originated from Root AC (AC1) and its destination is
      Root AC (AC3); On side of PE2, PW is originated from Root AC (AC3)
      and its destination is Root AC (AC1);

   -  PW 2 between r attached to AC 1 and l' attached AC 4. On side of
      PE1, PW is originated from Root AC (AC1) and its destination is
      Leaf AC (AC4); On side of PE2, PW is originated from Leaf AC
      (AC4)and its destination is Root AC (AC1);

   -  PW 3 between l attached to AC 2 and r' attached AC 3. On side of
      PE1, PW is originated from Leaf AC (AC2) and its destination is
      Root AC (AC3); On side of PE2, PW is originated from Root AC (AC3)
      and its destination is Leaf AC (AC2);

   In this way, if one broadcast received from AC 3, PE2 needs to
   replicate it into two copies and transmit them via PW 1 and PW 3. It
   will waste network bandwidth, and manufacturer can improve this in
   his/her own way. This is outside the scope of this document.

   In addition, inside of PE1 or PE2, there is local forwarding, say on
   PE1, if one broadcast received from AC 1, it transmits to AC 2 which
   belongs to another endpoint in same VSI. To establish one dummy PW or
   not depends on manufacturer's implementation and this is outside the
   scope of this document.

7. Compliance with Requirements

   The proposed solution in this document meets the requirements
   mentioned in [Draft VPLS ETree Req] Section 5.

   The solution prohibits communication between any two Leaf endpoints
   in a VPLS and communication between any two attachment circuits of
   any Leaf endpoint.

   The solution allows multiple Root-ACs or multiple Leaf-ACs in an E-
   Tree instance.

   The solution allows Root-Leaf-Mixed on any PE in an E-Tree.

   The solution is applicable to BGP-VPLS [RFC4761] and LDP-VPLS
   [RFC4762].

   The solution is applicable to Case 1: Single technology "VPLS-only".
