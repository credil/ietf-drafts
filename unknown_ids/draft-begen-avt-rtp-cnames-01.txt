  Guidelines for Choosing RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Names
                                (CNAMEs)
                     draft-begen-avt-rtp-cnames-01

Abstract

   The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Name (CNAME) is a
   persistent transport-level identifier for an RTP endpoint.  While the
   Synchronization Source (SSRC) identifier of an RTP endpoint may
   change if a collision is detected, or when the RTP application is
   restarted, the CNAME is meant to stay unchanged, so that RTP
   endpoints can be uniquely identified and associated with their RTP
   media streams.  For proper functionality, CNAMEs should be unique
   within the participants of an RTP session.  However, the
   recommendations for choice of the RTCP CNAME provided in RFC 3550 are
   insufficient to achieve this uniqueness.  This memo updates the
   guidelines in RFC 3550 to allow endpoints to choose unique CNAMEs.

Internet-Draft            Choice of RTCP CNAME                  May 2010


1.  Introduction

   In Section 6.5.1 of [RFC3550], there are a number of recommendations
   for choosing the RTCP CNAME for an RTP endpoint.  These recommend
   that the CNAME is of the form "user@host" for multiuser systems, or
   "host" if the username is not available.  The "host" part is
   specified to be the fully qualified domain name of the host from
   which the real-time data originates, or the numeric representation of
   the IP address of the interface from which the RTP data originates
   for hosts that do not have a domain name.

   As noted in [RFC3550], the use of private network address space
   [RFC1918] can result in hosts having network addresses that are not
   globally unique.  However, this problem is not solely with private
   network addresses, but may also occur with public IP addresses, where
   multiple hosts are assigned the same public IP address and connected
   to a Network Address Translation (NAT) device
   [I-D.miles-behave-l2nat].  When multiple hosts share the same IP
   address, using the IP address as the CNAME can lead to non-unique
   CNAMEs.

   [RFC3550] also notes that if hosts with private addresses and no
   direct IP connectivity to the public Internet have their RTP packets
   forwarded to the public Internet through an RTP-level translator,
   they may end up having non-unique CNAMEs.  [RFC3550] suggests that
   such applications provide a configuration option to allow the user to
   choose a unique CNAME, and puts the burden on the translator to
   translate CNAMEs from private addresses to public addresses if
   necessary to keep private addresses from being exposed.  Experience
   has shown that this does not work well in practice.

   For all these reasons, this memo proposes alternative algorithms for
   choosing CNAMEs.


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Choice of RTCP CNAME in Private Networks

   It is a difficult task for a host to determine whether it resides
   behind a NAT without the help of an external mechanism such as STUN
   [RFC5389].  Furthermore, even some public IP addresses can be shared
   by multiple hosts in the Internet.  Thus, using the numeric

   representation of the IP address as the RTCP CNAME is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.

   In order to meet the SHOULD requirement of Section 6.5.1 of
   [RFC3550], RTP endpoints SHOULD practice one of the following
   guidelines:

   o  Given that IPv6 addresses are naturally unique, a host MAY use its
      IPv6 address as the CNAME when using an IPv6 interface for RTP
      communication.  If the RTP endpoint is associated with a unique
      local IPv6 unicast address [RFC4193], that address MAY be used as
      the CNAME as well.  Using IPv6 addresses as CNAMEs was originally
      suggested in [RFC3550].

   o  A host that does not know its fully qualified domain name, and is
      configured with a private IP address on the interface it is using
      for RTP communication, MAY use the numeric representation of the
      layer-2 (MAC) address of the interface it is using for RTP
      communication as the "host" part of its CNAME.  For IEEE 802 MAC
      addresses, such as Ethernet, the standard colon-separated
      hexadecimal format is to be used, e.g., "00:23:32:af:9b:aa".

   o  A host MAY use its Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) [RFC4122]
      as the CNAME.

   This memo does not mandate a specific order in which these methods
   should be practiced.  A specific order would be only needed if an RTP
   endpoint was expected to be comprised of multiple programs that
   independently needed to choose the same CNAME.  Since this is not a
   common implementation technique, a specific order is not needed.


4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC3550] apply to this document as
   well.


5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations in this document.


6.  Acknowledgments

   Thanks to Dan Wing who pointed out the concerns about cases where two
   hosts could share the same public IP address.  Also, thanks to Marc
   Petit-Huguenin who suggested to use UUIDs as CNAMEs.
