     Requirements for the use of the Reason header filed in Session
                  Initiation Protocol (SIP) responses
            draft-jesske-dispatch-req-reason-in-responses-00

Abstract

   Although the use of the Reason header field in responses is
   considered in RFC3326, doing so is not specified for any existing
   response code.  Nonetheless, the Reason header field has been widely
   used in responses to carry Q.850 reason codes for failure responses
   to INVITEs that have been gatewayed to PSTN systems.  This document
   specifies and formally permits the use of the Reason header field in
   SIP responses to carry Q.850 reason codes for this and other
   purposes.

Internet-Draft                Reason Header                   March 2010


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses terms from [RFC3261].


2.  Overview

   With introducing the Session Initiation Protocol [RFC3261]into the IP
   Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) which is defined by the 3rd Generation
   Partnership Project the it was required to interoperate with the
   PSTN/ISDN.  The European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI)
   has defined a Next Generation Network (NGN) where a substantial part
   of it is based on the IMS.

   ETSI has developed a number of requirements to support the usage of
   SIP in Next Generation Networks that interoperate, at the service
   level, with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), the
   Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), the 3GPP IP Multimedia
   Subsystem (IMS), and SIP networks and terminals that implement the
   service logic.

   Also ITU-T has specified an interworking between SIP and PSTN/ISDN
   networks [ITU.Q1912.5.2004] and [TS29.229]where reason within
   responses are already supported.

   In order to provide full support in SIP of existing services,
   extensions to SIP are needed.

   This document proposes the use of the Reason header field in
   responses.  This is needed for creating services that must be
   interoperable with the PSTN/ISDN network and the interoperability of
   traversing communications through SIP not using SIP-I.

   The main used case for reason header within responses are
   interworking situations with PSTN/ISDN networks where the ISUP cause
   In many cases the mapping of specific cause values will result in a
   generic SIP Response like it is shown below.

   [RFC3398] and other Interworking specifications like [RFC3326] are
   describing the mapping of ISUP Cause Values to SIP and vice versa.
   Looking on the specific mapping shows that information will be lost
   when the call traverses ISUP without using SIP-T.

   Example:

Internet-Draft                Reason Header                   March 2010


   [RFC3398] describes the mapping of following ISUP Causes to 503 and
   408 like follows.


      ISUP Cause value                        SIP response
      ----------------                        ------------
      34 no circuit available                 503 Service unavailable
      38 network out of order                 503 Service unavailable
      41 temporary failure                    503 Service unavailable
      42 switching equipment congestion       503 Service unavailable
      47 resource unavailable                 503 Service unavailable
      58 bearer capability not presently      503 Service unavailable
         Available
      88 incompatible destination             503 Service unavailable

      18 no user responding                   408 Request Timeout

   The mapping back is shown as follows:

      Response received                        Cause value in the REL
      -----------------                        ----------------------
      503 Service unavailable                  41 Temporary failure

      408 Request timeout                      102 Recovery on timer
                                                   expiry


   The Example with 503 shows that a couple of different ISUP Cause
   values are interworked to only one SIP response.  With 408 the
   meaning of the release cause is changed when interworked back to
   ISUP.  Also Services built on Cause 18 (e.G. a 2nd call attempt on an
   other number, this service is like a sequential forking) will not
   work.


3.  Requirements

   REQ-1:

   It should be possible to support PSTN-SIP-PSTN scenarios where the
   reason of a call release can be transferred though the SIP domain
   without any loss of information and no change of reason.

   REQ-2:

   It should be possible to provide correct announcements to a SIP user
   based on the reason for call clearing within the PSTN network or the
   PSTN user.  The PSTN does normally not provide announcements to

Internet-Draft                Reason Header                   March 2010


   originating user when clearing the call.

   REQ-3:

   A UA may have the ability to display ISUP specific release causes or
   show a equivalent text.  A inclusion of [Q.850] causes is out of
   scope.

   REQ-4:

   A application server providing specific PSTN like services may have
   the possibility to include ISUP specific release causes

3.1.  Used Cases for the requirements

   REQ-1 shows the scenario between two ISUP Gateways where SIP-I is not
   a solution to be used.  A IMS network defined by 3GPP where SIP-I is
   not part of the framework is such an example.  A used case is shown
   in Figure 2.

   REQ-2 identifies the scenario the gateway passes on the cause and
   some announcement server translates the cause into the appropriate
   announcement.

   REQ-3 excludes that a SIP UA includes [Q.850] cause values because
   that is not needed due to the different context of a SIP UA and of
   course the existing SIP response codes.  Also the possibility of
   displaying Q.850 causes should be used very restrictive and is not
   recommended.  A used case could be a used case could be a Integrated
   Access Device where a POTS Phone is connected to.  It is recommended
   to ignore the cause value if received be a UA.

   REQ-4: allows an Application Server that is providing specific
   Services simulating PSTN services to include Q.850 Causes.  This is
   needed specific for IMS operators which are substituting their PSTN
   to IMS.  These operators may run Services in the SIP domain that are
   provided to PSTN end users.


4.  Overall Applicability

   The SIP procedures specified in this document are foreseen for
   networks providing simulation services and/or interworking to the
   PSTN/ISDN.

   The document is describing the use of the Reason header in SIP
   responses.  These procedures are only valuable if the reason
   contained in the element "protocol" is "Q.850".  A inclusion of a SIP

Internet-Draft                Reason Header                   March 2010


   reason (protocol="SIP") is not helpful due to the fact that the
   response already provides the SIP reason.  The Release Causes are
   described within [Q.850].  (Note: The ETSI specifications can be
   downloaded under http://pda.etsi.org/pda/queryform.asp free of
   charge.)

   The appearance of the Reason header is applicable to final responses
   3xx, 4xx, 5xx and 6xx and 18x and 199 provisional responses
   [I-D.ietf-sipcore-199], the procedures for that are described within
   [draft-jesske-dispatch-reason-in-responses-02] .


5.  Example

   Figure 1 shows the example of SIP interworking with the PSTN/ISDN.
   Cause #87 is sent when the connecting user is not member of a Closed
   User Group.

                          Figure 1: ISUP-SIP Call

   Figure 2 shows the example where the SIP network is used as transit
   between PSTN/ISDN networks.  This avoids that the Mapping back to the
   Q.850 cause within ISUP change the meaning of the reason for release
   of the call.

                          Figure 2: Transit case

   Figure 3 shows the example where the SIP network puts an announcement
   towards the UAB.  The AS sends an announcement with a specific text
   back.  After some Time the Response will be sent back to the UA A and
   closes all open transactions.  With this possibility the SIP user can
   informed with more specific information than only the Response code.

   the SIP network.


6.  Security Considerations

   The presence of the Reason header in a response does not affect the
   treatment of the response.

   Including such a header by an untrusted entity could adulterate the
   reactions of the originating entities.  E.G. sending back a cause
   value "87" can cause an announcement within the PSTN/ISDN saying that
   the call was rejected due to the Closed User Group service.

   Therefore it is RECOMMENDED to include the Reason header information
   in Responses only by trusted entities as it is described within
   [RFC3325].


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not have any implications for IANA.
