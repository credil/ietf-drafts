    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes how to use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over Transport Layer Security (TLS) as a dereferencing protocol to resolve a reference to a Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO). The document assumes that a Location Recipient possesses a secure HELD URI that can be used in conjunction with the HELD protocol to request the location of the Target. </t>

      <t>A held: URI scheme is defined for use with resources that can be accessed using the mechanisms defined in this document. [Note: this is a provisional inclusion only]</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Provision of <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements">location information by reference</xref> involves the creation of a resource that is identified by a URI.  This "location URI" can identify a temporary resource, created in response to a <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery">HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)</xref> request.  A location URI does not necessarily include any useful information, instead the URI is "dereferenced" by a Location Recipient to acquire location information.  This document specifies how a recipient of a location URI uses that URI to retrieve location information.
      </t>

      <t>The HELD protocol, as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>, defines a use of HTTP that enables location configuration - the process where a Device acquires location information about itself.  A part of location configuration is the provision of a location URI.  However, HELD does not describe how such a URI is used; this document provides that definition.
      </t>

      <t>This document defines how HELD is used by a Location Recipient to dereference a location URI and acquire location information.  The result of this process is location object in the form of a <xref target="RFC4119">Presence Information Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO) document</xref>.  A constrained set of HELD features are defined such that it is suitable for use as a <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements">location dereference protocol</xref>.  Use as a location dereference protocol requires use of the <xref target="RFC2818">Transport Layer Security (TLS) binding for HTTP</xref>.
      </t>

      <t>Use of HELD as a dereferencing protocol has the advantage that the Location Recipient can indicate the type of location information it would like to receive. This functionality is already available with the HELD base specification, described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>. Furthermore, the HELD response from the LIS towards the Location Recipient not only provides the PIDF-LO but also encapsulates supplementary information, such as error messages, back to the Location Recipient.
      </t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery">LIS discovery</xref> uses <spanx style="verb">https:</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">http:</spanx> URIs to identify the target of a HELD location configuration request.  In contrast, location URIs can be used in a much wider scope; the context where a location URI is found might not convey information about how it could be used to a recipient.  This document mints a new URI scheme, the <spanx style="verb">held:</spanx> URI, to clearly distinguish resources that can be accessed using HELD from other URIs.
      </t>

      <t>An example scenario envisioned by this document is shown in <xref target="fig1"/>.  This diagram shows how a location dereference protocol fits with location configuration and conveyance.  <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements"/> contains more information on this scenario and others like it.

      <t>This section discusses two extreme types of authorization models for dereferencing with HELD URIs, namely "Authorization by Possession" and "Authorization by Access Control".  In the subsequent subsections we discuss the properties of these two models.  These two models can, however, be used in combination in a real deployment. <xref target="communication-model"/>, from <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements"/>, shows the model applicable to location configuration, conveyance and dereference.

      <t>It is important to note that this document does not mandate a specific authorization model, nor does it constrain the usage with regard to these models in any way.  Additionally, it is possible to combine certain parts of both models.
      </t>


      <t>For either authorization model, the overall process is similar.  The following steps are followed, with minor alterations:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>The Target acquires a location URI from the LIS.  This might use HELD as a location configuration protocol (LCP).</t>

        <t> The Target then conveys the location URI to a third party, the Location Recipient (for example using SIP as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance"/>). This step is shown in (2) of <xref target="communication-model"/>. </t>

        <t>The Location Recipient then needs to dereference the location URI in order to obtain the Location Object (3).  Depending on the URI scheme of the location URI dereferencing might, as is the case for a <spanx style="verb">held:</spanx> URI, be performed as described in this document.</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>In this final step, the Location Server (LS) or LIS makes an authorization decision.  How this decision is reached depends on the authorization model.
      </t>

      <section anchor="pawn" title="Authorization by Possession">
        <t>In this model, possession - or knowledge - of the location URI is used to control access to location information.  A location URI is constructed such that it is hard to guess (see C9 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements"/>) and the set of entities that it is disclosed to is limited.  The only authentication required by the LS is evidence of possession of the URI.  The LS is able to immediately authorize any request that indicates this URI.
        </t>

        <t>Authorization by possession uses a very simple policy that does not typically require direct interaction with a Rule Maker; it is assumed that the Rule Maker is able to exert control over the distribution of the location URI.  Therefore, the LIS can operate with limited policy input from a Rule Maker.
        </t>

        <t>Limited disclosure is an important aspect of this authorization model.  The location URI is a secret; therefore, ensuring that adversaries are not able to acquire this information is paramount.  Encryption, such as might be offered by <xref target="RFC5246">TLS</xref> or <xref target="RFC3851">S/MIME</xref>, protects the information from eavesdroppers.
        </t>

        <t>Use of authorization by possession location URIs in a hop-by-hop protocol such as <xref target="RFC3261">SIP</xref> adds the possibility of on-path adversaries.  Depending on the usage of the location URI for certain location based applications (e.g., emergency services, location based routing) specific treatment is important, as discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance"/>.
        </t>

        <t>Using possession as a basis for authorization means that, once granted, authorization cannot be easily revoked.  Cancellation of a location URI ensures that legitimate users are also affected; application of additional policy is theoretically possible, but could be technically infeasible.  Therefore, other measures are provided to prevent an adversary from gaining access to location information indefinitely.
        </t>

        <t>A very simple policy is established at the time that the location URI is created.  This policy specifies that the location URI expires after a certain time, which limits any inadvertent exposure of location information to adversaries.  The expiration time of the location URI might be negotiated at the time of its creation, as is the case with <xref target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context"/>.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Authorization via Access Control">
        <t>Use of explicit access control provides a Rule Maker greater control over the behaviour of an LS.  In contrast to authorization by possession, possession of a this form of location URI does not imply authorization.  Since an explicit policy is used to authorize access to location information, the location URI can be distributed to many potential Location Recipients.
        </t>

        <t>Either before creation or dissemination of the location URI, the Rule Maker establishes an authorization policy with the LS.  In reference to <xref target="communication-model"/>, authorization policies might be established at creation (Step 1), and need to be established before before the location URI is published (Step 2) to ensure that the policy grants access to the desired Location Recipients.  Depending on the mechanism used, it might also be possible to change authorization policies at any time.
        </t>

        <t>A possible format for these authorization policies is available with GEOPRIV Common Policy <xref target="RFC4745"/> and Geolocation Policy <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy"/>.  Additional constraints might be established by other means.
        </t>

        <t>The LS enforces the authorization policy when a Location Recipient dereferences the URI.  Explicit authorization policies allow a Rule Maker to specify the identity of Location Recipients, constrain the accuracy and form of location information, and to control other aspects of the authorization process.
        </t>

    <section anchor="details" title="HELD Dereference Protocol">

      <t>This section describes how HELD can be used to dereference a location URI.
      </t>

      <t>[[This version of the document describes a held: URI and its usage.  It is the consensus of the authors of this document that the cost of a new URI scheme is not justified by the benefits provided.  The intent of the inclusion of the scheme in this version of the document is to provide a concrete basis for discussion of the issue.  The following is a summary of arguments already presented:
      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="For a new scheme:">The benefit provided by the held: URI scheme is the explicit indication that the URI is a reference to location information and that HELD can be used.  If the Location Recipient has specific preferences for location information, then dereferencing without this explicit indication requires some trial and error.  Without the explicit indication, a generic UA like a web browser might need to make a second request once the destination is identified as a HELD LS.
        </t>
        <t hangText="Against:">The Location Recipient is still likely to need to use contextual information to identify the subject of the location information (c.f. rules on using unlinked pseudonyms in the PIDF-LO).  Since some contextual information is required no matter what circumstances, requiring that context also identify the type of URI is not a significant leap.  This approach is taken for many web services: RESTful services, SOAP, and so forth.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        The costs involved in minting a new URI scheme are non-trivial.  In particular, new URI schemes cannot be used by existing software without some modification.  Generic UAs like web browsers can use the HELD MIME type (application/held+xml) to identify that the URI is a location URI.  Once identified thus, if more specific information is required, a using application is able to make a second request.
        </t>
      </list>]]

        <t><xref target="iana-uri"/> contains the registration template for a <spanx style="verb">held:</spanx> URI scheme.  This URI indicates a resource that is able to provide the location of an entity, accessible using the HELD protocol, as described in this section.
        </t>

        <t>A Location Recipient that wishes to dereference a <spanx style="verb">held:</spanx> URI performs a HELD request to the equivalent <spanx style="verb">https:</spanx> URI.  The <spanx style="verb">https:</spanx> URI is found by replacing the <spanx style="verb">held:</spanx> scheme in the URI with <spanx style="verb">https:</spanx>.  A limited subset of HELD is used for this request, as defined in <xref target="held-profile"/>.
        </t>

        <t>For example, for <spanx style="verb">held://ls.example.com/12345</spanx>, the Location Recipient makes a HELD request to <spanx style="verb">https://ls.example.com/12345</spanx>.
        </t>

        <t>The Location Recipient establishes a TLS connections to the LS, as described in <xref target="RFC2818"/>.  The TLS ciphersuite TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL MUST NOT be used.  The LS MUST be authenticated to ensure that the correct server is contacted.  Given that a location URI does not indicate the authorization model used, the Location Recipient MUST be prepared to provide authentication information unless it has information to the contrary.  This document does not specify how the LS authenticates the Location Recipient; a Location Recipient MUST support provision of a client certificate during TLS session creation and <xref target="RFC2617">HTTP digest authentication</xref>, unless these authentication methods are known to be inapplicable.
        </t>

        <t>A Location Recipient MAY use an <spanx style="verb">https:</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">http:</spanx> URI as a location URI and make a HELD request.  The Location Recipient relies on external information to determine that a <spanx style="verb">https:</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">http:</spanx> URI is a location URI since these URIs contain no inherent indication of their purpose.
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Note:">An <spanx style="verb">http:</spanx> URI SHOULD NOT be used for location URIs.  Lack of encryption and ineffectual authentication mechanisms mean that the Rule Maker has no control over who receives location information and the Location Recipient has no assurance that the information is correct.

      <section anchor="held-profile" title="HELD Usage Profile">
        <t>Use of HELD as a location dereference protocol is largely the same as its use as a location configuration protocol.  Aside from the restrictions noted in this document, HELD semantics do not differ from those established in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>.
        </t>

        <t>The HELD <spanx style="verb">locationRequest</spanx> is the only request permitted by this specification.  Similarly, request parameters other than the following MUST NOT be supported by the LS: <spanx style="verb">responseTime</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">locationType</spanx> (including the associated <spanx style="verb">exact</spanx> attribute).  Other specifications MUST explicitly describe how other requests or parameters apply to dereference requests.  The LS MUST ignore any parameters that it does not understand unless it knows the parameters to be invalid, such as those defined in <xref target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-identity-extensions"/>.  If parameters are known to be invalid, the LS MAY generate a HELD error response.
        </t>

        <t>The LS MUST NOT generate any location URIs or provide a <spanx style="verb">locationUriSet</spanx> in response to a dereference request.  If the location request contains a <spanx style="verb">locationType</spanx> element that includes <spanx style="verb">locationURI</spanx>, this parameter is either ignored or rejected as appropriate, based on the associated <spanx style="verb">exact</spanx> attribute.
        </t>

        <t>This document requires additional HTTP features from Location Recipients that are not required of Devices in HELD.  <xref target="RFC2617">HTTP digest authentication</xref> MUST be supported by Location Recipients, unless there is no means to provide such authentication information.

    <section anchor="examples" title="Examples">

      <t>The example in <xref target="ex-request"/> shows the simplest form of dereferencing request using HELD to the URI <spanx style="verb">held://ls.example.com:49152/uri/w3g61nf5n66p0</spanx>.  The only way that this differs from the example in Section 10.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/> is in the request URI and the source of the URI.

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Privacy of location information is the most important security consideration for this document.  Two measures in particular are used to protect privacy: TLS and authorization policies.  TLS provides a means of ensuring confidentiality of location information through encryption and mutual authentication.  An authorization policy allows a Rule Maker to explicitly control how location information is provided to Location Recipients.  The process by which a Rule Maker establishes an authorization policy is not covered by this document; several methods are possible, for instance: <xref target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context"/>, <xref target="RFC4825"/>.
      </t>

      <t>Use of TLS for the dereferencing of location URIs is strongly RECOMMENDED, as discussed in <xref target="using"/>.  Location Recipients MUST authenticate the host identity using the domain name included in the location URI, using the procedure described in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC2818"/>.  Local policy determines what a Location Recipient does is authentication fails, or is not attempted.
      </t>

      <t>The <xref target="pawn">authorization by possession model</xref> further relies on TLS when transmitting the location URI to protect the secrecy of the URI.  Possession of such a URI implies the same privacy considerations as possession of the PIDF-LO document that the URI references.  This is necessary, since the policy attached to such a location URI permits any who have the URI to view it.  This aspect of security is covered in more detail in the specification of location conveyance protocols, such as <xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance"/>.
      </t>

      <t>The Location Recipient MUST be prepared to provide authentication credentials when making a dereference request.
      </t>

      <t>To comply with identity protection requirements in <xref target="RFC3693"/>, the LS MUST NOT include any information that could be used to identify a Target, unless policy is provided that allows this.  To this end, an unlinked pseudonym MUST be provided in the <spanx style="verb">entity</spanx> attribute of the PIDF-LO document.
      </t>

      <t>Further security considerations and requirements relating to the use of location URIs are described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements"/>.

    <section title="GEOPRIV Using Protocol Compliance">
      <t>This section describes how use of HELD as a location dereference protocol complies with the GEOPRIV requirements described in <xref target="RFC3693"/>.

      <list style="format Req. %d." counter="Requirements">
        <t>(Location Object generalities):
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        This section relates to the <xref target="RFC4119">PIDF-LO</xref> document, which is used by HELD.  These requirements are addressed by <xref target="RFC4119"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile"/>.

        </t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>Section 7.2 of <xref target="RFC3693"/> details the requirements of
      a &quot;Using Protocol&quot;. These requirements are repeated here for reference, followed by a statement of compliance:

      <list style="format Req. %d." counter="Requirements">
        <t>"The using protocol has to obey the privacy and security instructions coded in the Location Object and in the corresponding Rules regarding the transmission and storage of the LO."
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        Compliant: This document carries the PIDF-LO as is via HTTPS from the LIS to the Location Recipient.  The sending and receiving parties must obey the instructions carried inside the object.
        </t>

        <t>"The using protocol will typically facilitate that the keys associated with the credentials are transported to the respective parties, that is, key establishment is the responsibility of the using protocol."
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        Compliant: This document specifies that authentication of the LS uses the established public key infrastructure used by <xref target="RFC2818">HTTP over TLS</xref>.  Location Recipient is accomplished using certificates exchanged using TLS, or through <xref target="RFC2617">HTTP digest authentication</xref>.  Authentication of Location Recipients as specified in this document requires pre-arrangement; further key establishment methods are left to later work.
        </t>

        <t>"(Single Message Transfer) In particular, for tracking of small target devices, the design should allow a single message/packet transmission of location as a complete transaction."
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        Not Compliant: The XML encoding specified in <xref target="RFC4119"/> is not suited to single packet transfers.  It is not the goal of this document to define a new Location Object format.
        </t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>Section 7.3 of <xref target="RFC3693"/> details the requirements of a &quot;Rule based Location Data Transfer&quot;.  These requirements are repeated where they are applicable to this document:
      <list style="format Req. %d." counter="Requirements">
        <t>"(LS Rules) The decision of a Location Server to provide a Location Recipient access to Location Information MUST be based on Rule Maker-defined Privacy Rules."
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        Compliance or Not Applicable: This document describes two alternative methods by which a Rule Maker is able to control access to location information.  Rule Maker policy is enforced by the LS when a location URI is dereferenced.  However, this document does not describe how a location URI is created, or how a Rule Maker associates policy with a location URI.  These are outside the scope of this document.
        </t>

        <t>(LG Rules) Not Applicable: This relationship between LS and the source of its information (be that Location Generator (LG) or LIS) is out of scope for this document.
        </t>

        <t>"(Viewer Rules) A Viewer does not need to be aware of the full Rules defined by the Rule Maker (because a Viewer SHOULD NOT retransmit Location Information), and thus a Viewer SHOULD receive only the subset of Privacy Rules necessary for the Viewer to handle the LO in compliance with the full Privacy Rules (such as, instruction on the time period for which the LO can be retained)."
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        Compliant: The Rule Maker might define (via mechanisms outside the scope of this document) which policy rules are disclosed to other entities.  For instance, if <xref target="RFC4745"/> is used to convey authorization policies from Rule Maker to LS, this is possible using the parameters specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy"/>.
        </t>

          <t>(Full Rule language) Not Applicable: Note however that Geopriv has defined a rule language capable of expressing a wide range of privacy rules (see <xref target="RFC4745"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy"/>.
          </t>

          <t>(Limited Rule language) Not Applicable: This requirement applies to (and is addressed by) <xref target="RFC4119">PIDF-LO</xref>. </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>Section 7.4 of <xref target="RFC3693"/> details the requirements of &quot;Location Object Privacy and Security&quot;.  These requirements are repeated where they are applicable to this document:
        <list style="format Req. %d." counter="Requirements">
          <t>(Identity Protection) Potentially Compliant: Identity protection of the Target is provided as long as both of the following conditions are true:
            <list style="format (%c)" counter="subbullets">
              <t>the location URI is not associated with the identity of the Target in any context, and
              </t>
              <t>if the PIDF-LO does not contain information about the identity about the Target.
              </t>
              For instance, this requirement is complied with if the protocol that conveys the location URI does not link the identity of the Target to the location URI and the LS doesn't include meaningful identification information in the PIDF-LO document.  <xref target="security"/> recommends that an unlinked pseudonym is used by the LS.
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>(Credential Requirements) Compliant: The primary security mechanism specified in this document is Transport Layer Security.  TLS offers the ability to use different types of credentials, including symmetric, asymmetric credentials or a combination of them.</t>

          <t>(Security Features) Compliant: Geopriv defines a few security requirements for the protection of Location Objects such as mutual end-point authentication, data object integrity, data object confidentiality and replay protection.  The ability to use Transport Layer security fulfills these requirements. </t>

          <t>(Minimal Crypto) Compliant: The mandatory to implement ciphersuite is provided in the TLS layer security specification.</t>

    <section title="Compliance to Location Reference Requirements">
      <t>This section describes how HELD complies to the location reference requirements stipulated

            Compliant: HELD only provides location references in URI form.
            </t>

            <t>"location URI expiration:  When a location URI has a limited validity interval, its lifetime MUST be indicated."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Compliant: HELD indicates the expiry time of location URIs using the <spanx style="verb">expires</spanx> attribute.  <xref target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context">HELD contexts</xref> also expire, and an explicit indication is included in the context response; a Device is able to specify limits on the life time of a HELD context.
            </t>

            <t>"location URI cancellation: The location configuration protocol MUST support the ability to request a cancellation of a specific location URI."

            Compliant conditional on on the source of the location URI: <xref target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context">HELD contexts</xref> can be explicitly removed.  HELD does not provide a method for cancelling location URIs.
            </t>

            <t>"Location Information Masking: The location URI form MUST, through randomization and uniqueness, ensure that any location specific information embedded within the location URI itself is kept obscure during location configuration."

            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Compliant: The HELD specification explicitly references this requirement in providing guidance on the format of the location URI.
            </t>

            <t>"User Identity Protection: The location URI MUST NOT contain any user identifying information that identifies the user, device or address of record, (e.g., which includes phone extensions, badge numbers, first or last names, etc.), within the URI form."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Compliant: The HELD specification provides specific guidance on the anonymity of the Target with regards to the generation of location URIs.  <xref target="security"/> expands on this guidance.
            </t>

            <t>"Reuse indicator: There SHOULD be a way to allow a client to control whether a location URI can be resolved once only, or multiple times."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Compliant: The default semantics of location URIs in HELD place no limits on the number of times that a location URI can be dereferenced.
            </t>

            <t>"Validity Interval Indication: A location configuration protocol MUST provide an indication of the location URI validity interval (i.e., expiry time) when present."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Duplicate Requirement: As above.
            </t>

            <t>"Location only: The location URI MUST NOT point to any information about the Target other than it's location."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Compliance depends on implementation: A PIDF-LO document can contain information other than location, but no protocol semantics exist that allow for or encourage inclusion of other information.
            </t>

            <t>"Location URI Not guessable: Where location URIs are used publicly, any location URI MUST be constructed using properties of uniqueness and cryptographically random sequences so that it is not guessable."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Compliant: HELD specifies that location URIs conform to this requirement.
            </t>

            <t>"Location URI Optional: In the case of user-provided authorization policies, where anonymous or non-guessable location URIs are not warranted, the location configuration protocol MAY support optional location URI forms."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Not Compliant: HELD does not support Device-specified location URI forms.
            </t>

            <t>"Location URI Authorization Model: The location configuration protocol SHOULD indicate whether the requested location URI conforms to the access control authorization model or the possession authorization model."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Compliant: HELD explicitly indicates that the possession model applies to all URIs.
            </t>

            <t>"Location URI Lifetime: A location URI SHOULD have an associated expiration lifetime (i.e., validity interval), and MUST have an validity interval if used with the possession authorization model."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Duplicate Requirement: As above.
            </t>

          <list style="format D%d." counter="lbyr-ldp">
            <t>"Location URI support: The location dereference protocol MUST support a location reference in URI form."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Compliant: HELD only provides location references in URI form.
            </t>

            <t>"Validity Interval Indication: A location dereference protocol MUST provide an indication of the location URI validity interval (i.e., expiry time) when present."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Invalid Requirement: not applicable to location dereference protocols.
            </t>

            <t>"Authentication: The location dereference protocol MUST include mechanisms to authenticate both the client and the server."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Compliant: TLS provides means for mutual authentication.  This document only specifies the required mechanism for server authentication.
            </t>

            <t>"Dereferenced Location Form: The value returned by the dereference protocol MUST contain a well-formed PIDF-LO document."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Compliant: HELD requires that location objects are in the form of a PIDF-LO that complies with <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile"/>.
            </t>

            <t>"Location URI Repeated Use: The location dereference protocol MUST support the ability for the same location URI to be resolved more than once, based on dereference server configuration."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Compliant: A Location Recipient may access and use a location URI as many times as desired until URI expiration results in the URI being invalidated.  Authorization policies might include rules that modify this behavior.
            </t>

            <t>"Validity Interval Indication: A dereference protocol MUST provide an indication of the location URI validity interval (i.e., expiry time) when present."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Not Compliant: This document does not provide this indication - this information is arguably useful to a Location Recipient, but it also reveals something about the policy associated with the location URI.  Without also providing a mechanism to suppress this capability and hide the expiry time, this might reveal more information than a Rule Maker is willing to share.
            </t>

            <t>"Location URI anonymized: Any location URI whose dereference will not be subject to authentication and access control MUST be anonymized."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Not applicable to location dereference protocols - applies to the creation of the URI.
            </t>

            <t>"Location Information Masking: The location URI form MUST, through randomization and uniqueness, ensure that any location specific information embedded within the location URI itself is kept obscure during location URI dereferencing."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Not applicable to location dereference protocols - applies to the creation of the URI.
            </t>

            <t>"Location Privacy: The location dereference protocol MUST support the application of privacy rules to the dissemination of a requested location object."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Compliant: Authorization policy must be applied by the LS for all attempts at dereferencing.  Note that in the case of authorization by possession, this authorization policy grants access to location information based on proof of knowledge of the location URI.
            </t>

            <t>"Location Confidentiality: The dereference protocol MUST support encryption of messages sent between the location dereference client and the location dereference server, and MAY alternatively provide messaging unencrypted."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Compliant: This document strongly recommends the use of TLS for confidentiality.  Unsecured HTTP is permitted, and some of the associated risks are described in <xref target="held-profile"/>.
            </t>

            <t>"Location URI Authorization Model: The location dereference protocol SHOULD indicate whether the requested location URI conforms to the access control authorization model or the possession authorization model."
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Not Compliant: The basis of an authorization decision is potentially private information; this document does not provide this indication.  Note that the recipient of a location URI is expected to respect the confidentiality of a location URI as if it were secret, even if it is not.
