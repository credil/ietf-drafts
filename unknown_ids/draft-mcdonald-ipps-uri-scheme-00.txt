Internet Draft    IPPS URI Scheme & Transport Binding    12 October 2010



1.  Introduction

   This memo conforms to all of the requirements and recommendations in 
   Guidelines and Registration Procedures for New URI Schemes [RFC4395].
   
   This memo defines the IPPS URI scheme and the corresponding IPP over 
   HTTPS transport binding.  This memo updates the Internet Printing
   Protocol/1.1 Model and Semantics [RFC2911], by extending section
   4.1.6 'uriScheme' and section 4.4.1 'printer-uri-supported'.  This
   memo updates the Internet Printing Protocol/1.1 Encoding and
   Transport [RFC2910], by extending section 4 'Encoding of the
   Transport Layer', section 5 'IPP URL Scheme', and section 8.2 'Using
   IPP with TLS'.  
   
   This memo is a product of the Internet Printing Protocol Working
   Group of the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working Group (PWG).  
   
   An IPPS URI is used to specify the network location of a secure print
   service that supports the IPP/1.1 Encoding and Transport (RFC 2910),
   or of a network resource (for example, a print job) managed by such a
   secure print service.  
   
   Overview information about the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is
   available in section 1 'Introduction' of IPP/1.1 Model and Semantics 
   [RFC2911] and section 1 'Introduction' of IPP Implementor's Guide
   [RFC3196].  
   
   The IPPS URI scheme defined in this document is based on the ABNF
   [RFC5234] for the HTTPS URI scheme [RFC2818], which in turn is
   updated by the URI Generic Syntax [RFC3986].  An IPPS URI is
   transformed into an HTTPS URI according to the rules specified in
   section 4.5 of this specification.  
   
   This document defines IPPS URI scheme applicability, associated port 
   (631), associated MIME type ("application/ipp"), character encoding,
   and syntax.  
   
   This document contains the following sections:  
   - Section 2 defines the conformance terminology used throughout the
     document.  
     
   - Section 3 defines the IPP over HTTPS transport binding, after first
     summarizing the IPP object model terminology and the original IPP
     over HTTP transport binding.  
     
   - Section 4 defines the IPPS URI scheme.  
     
   - Section 5 defines the conformance requirements for IPP Clients and 
     IPP Printers that claim conformance to this document.

Internet Draft    IPPS URI Scheme & Transport Binding    12 October 2010

     
   - Sections 6, 7, and 8 define IANA, internationalization, and
     security considerations.  
     
   - Sections 9, 10, and 11 contain references, acknowledgements, and
     author addresses.  
     
   - Section 12 (Appendix A) defines is a complete IANA registration
     template for the IPPS URI Scheme.  
   
   [RFC Editor:  Section 13, which should be removed before publication
   as an RFC, contains a complete change history of this IPPS URI
   document.]

3.  IPP Transport Bindings

   
   
   3.1.  IPP Model Terminology (Normative)
   
   See:  Section 12.2 'Model Terminology' in IPP/1.1 Model and Semantics
   [RFC2911].  
   
   See:  Section 2 'IPP Objects', section 2.1 'Printer Object', and
   section 2.2 'Job Object' in IPP/1.1 Encoding and Transport [RFC2911]
   for a full description of the IPP object model and terminology.  
   
   In this document, "IPP Client" means the software (on some hardware
   platform) that submits, monitors, and/or manages secure print jobs
   via the IPP/1.1 Encoding and Transport [RFC2910] to a secure print
   spooler, secure print gateway, or secure physical printing device.  
   
   In this document, "IPP Printer object" means the software (on some
   hardware platform) that receives secure print jobs and/or secure
   printer/job operations via the IPP/1.1 Encoding and Transport
   [RFC2910] from an "IPP Client".  
   
   In this document, "IPP Printer" is a synonym for "IPP Printer
   object".  
   
   In this document, "IPP Job object" means the set of attributes and
   documents for one secure print job instantiated on an "IPP Printer".
   
   In this document, "IPP Job" is a synonym for "IPP Job object".  
   
   In this document, "IPPS URI" means a URI using the IPPS URI scheme
   defined in section 4 of this specification.  
   
   In this document, "IPPS URI" is a synonym for the "ipps-uri" ABNF
   [RFC5234] production defined in section 4.5 of this specification.  
   
   
   
   3.2.  IPP Over HTTP Transport Binding (Informative)
   
   When using an IPP URI [RFC3510], an IPP Client establishes an IPP
   application layer connection according to the following sequence:  
   
   1) The IPP Client selects an IPP URI value from
      "printer-uri-supported" Printer attribute [RFC2911], a directory
      entry, discovery info, a web page, etc.;

Internet Draft    IPPS URI Scheme & Transport Binding    12 October 2010

   2) The IPP Client converts the IPP URI to an HTTP URI (with inserted 
      port 631); 
      
   3) The IPP Client establishes a TCP transport layer connection to the
      target endpoint; 
      
   4) The IPP Client establishes an HTTP session layer connection to the
      target endpoint; 
      
   5) Optionally, the IPP Client upgrades to TLS within HTTP/1.1
      [RFC2817] to establish a TLS Protocol [RFC5246] secure transport
      sublayer within the original TCP/HTTP connection, based on the
      value of the "uri-security-supported" Printer attribute [RFC2911]
      parallel to the selected value of "printer-uri-supported"; and 
      
   6) The IPP Client sends IPP application layer requests to and
      receives responses from the IPP Printer over the HTTP session
      layer connection.  
   
   See:  Section 8 'Security Considerations' in [RFC2817].  
   
   
   
   3.3.  IPP over HTTPS Transport Binding (Normative)
   
   This document defines the following IPP over HTTPS alternate
   transport binding for the abstract protocol defined in IPP/1.1 Model
   and Semantics [RFC2911].  
   
   When using an IPPS URI, an IPP Client MUST establish an IPP
   application layer connection according to the following sequence:  
   
   1) The IPP Client selects an IPPS URI value from
      "printer-uri-supported" Printer attribute [RFC2911], a directory
      entry, discovery info, a web page, etc.; 
      
   2) The IPP Client converts the IPPS URI to an HTTPS URI (with
      inserted port 631); 
      
   3) The IPP Client establishes a TLS Protocol [RFC5246] over TCP
      secure transport layer connection to the target endpoint; 
      
   4) The IPP Client establishes an HTTP session layer connection to the
      target endpoint; and 
      
   5) The IPP Client sends IPP application layer requests to and
      receives responses from the IPP Printer over the HTTP session
      layer connection.  
   
   See:  Section 'Security Considerations' in [RFC2818].

4.  IPPS URI Scheme

   
   
   4.1.  IPPS URI Scheme Applicability
   
   The IPPS URI scheme MUST only be used to specify absolute URIs
   (relative IPPS URIs are not allowed) for IPP secure print services
   and their associated network resources.  The IPPS URI scheme MUST
   only be used to specify the use of the abstract protocol defined in
   IPP/1.1 Model and Semantics [RFC2911] over an HTTPS [RFC2818]
   transport, as defined in this specification.  Any other transport
   binding for the abstract protocol defined in IPP/1.1 Model and
   Semantics [RFC2911] would require a different URI scheme.  
   
   The IPPS URI scheme allows an IPP Client to choose an appropriate IPP
   secure print service (for example, from a directory).  The IPP Client
   can establish an HTTPS connection to the specified IPP secure print
   service.  The IPP Client can send IPP protocol requests (for example,
   'Print-Job' requests) and receive IPP protocol responses over that
   HTTPS connection.  
   
   See:  Section 3.3 'IPP over HTTPS Transport Binding'.  
   
   See:  Section 4.4.1 'printer-uri-supported' in IPP/1.1 Model and
   Semantics [RFC2911].  
   
   See:  Section 5 'IPP URL Scheme' in IPP/1.1 Encoding and Transport
   [RFC2910].  
   
   
   
   4.2.  IPPS URI Scheme Associated Port
   
   All IPPS URIs which do NOT explicitly specify a port MUST be resolved
   to IANA-assigned well-known port 631, as registered in
   [IANA-PORTREG].  
   
   See:  IANA Port Numbers Registry [IANA-PORTREG].  
   
   See:  IPP/1.1 Encoding and Transport [RFC2910].  
   
   
   
   4.3.  IPPS URI Scheme Associated MIME Type
   
   All IPPS URIs MUST be used to specify secure print services which
   support the "application/ipp" MIME media type as registered in
   [IANA-MIMEREG] for IPP protocol requests and responses.

   See:  IANA MIME Media Types Registry [IANA-MIMEREG].  
   
   See:  IPP/1.1 Encoding and Transport [RFC2910].  
   
   
   
   4.4.  IPPS URI Scheme Character Encoding
   
   IPPS URIs MUST use [RFC3986] encoding, as do their equivalent HTTPS
   URIs.  Characters other than those in the "reserved" and "unsafe"
   sets [RFC3986] are equivalent to their ""%" HEX HEX" encoding.  
   
   
   
   4.5.  IPPS URI Scheme Syntax
   
   The abstract protocol defined in IPP/1.1 Model and Semantics
   [RFC2911] places a limit of 1023 octets (NOT characters) on the
   length of a URI.  
   
   See:  Section 4.1.5 'uri' in [RFC2911].  
   
      Note:  IPP Printers ought to be cautious about depending on URI
      lengths above 255 bytes, because some older IPP Client
      implementations might not properly support these lengths.  
   
   IPPS URIs MUST be represented in absolute form.  Absolute URIs MUST
   always begin with a scheme name followed by a colon.  For definitive 
   information on URI syntax and semantics, see "Uniform Resource
   Identifiers (URI) Generic Syntax and Semantics" [RFC3986].  This
   specification adopts the definitions of "host", "port",
   "path-absolute", and "query" from [RFC3986].  
   
   The IPPS URI scheme syntax in ABNF [RFC5234] is defined as follows:  
   
   ipps-uri = "ipps:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ path-absolute [ "?" query
   
   If the port is empty or not given, then port 631 is assumed.  The
   semantics are that the identified resource (see section 5.1.2 of
   [RFC2616]) is located at the IPP secure print service listening for
   HTTPS connections on that port of that host, and the Request-URI for
   the identified resource is 'path-absolute'.  
   
   If the 'path-absolute' is not present in the URI, it MUST be given as
   "/" when used as a Request-URI for a resource (see section 5.1.2 of
   [RFC2616]).  
   
   An IPPS URI is transformed into an HTTPS URI by replacing "ipps:"
   with "https:" and inserting port 631 (if the 'port' is not present in
   the original IPPS URI).

Internet Draft    IPPS URI Scheme & Transport Binding    12 October 2010

   
   See:  Section 3.3 'IPP over HTTPS Transport Binding'.  
   
   
   
   4.6.  IPPS URI Examples
   
   Note:  Literal IPv4 or IPv6 addresses SHOULD NOT be used in IPPS
   URIs.  
   
   
   
   4.6.1.  IPPS Printer URI Examples
   
   The following are examples of well-formed IPPS URIs for IPP Printers 
   (for example, to be used as protocol elements in 'printer-uri'
   operation attributes of 'Print-Job' request messages):  
   
       ipps://abc.com
       ipps://abc.com/printer
       ipps://abc.com/printer/tiger
       ipps://abc.com/printer/fox
       ipps://abc.com/printer/tiger/bob
       ipps://abc.com/printer/tiger/ira
   
   Each of the above URIs are well-formed URIs for IPP Printers and each
   would reference a logically different IPP Printer, even though some
   of those IPP Printers might share the same host system.  The 'bob' or
   'ira' last path components might represent two different physical
   printer devices, while 'tiger' might represent some grouping of IPP
   Printers (for example, a load-balancing spooler).  Or the 'bob' and
   'ira' last path components might represent separate human recipients
   on the same physical printer device (for example, a physical printer
   supporting two job queues).  In either case, both 'bob' and 'ira'
   would behave as different and independent IPP Printers.  
   
   The following are examples of well-formed IPPS URIs for IPP Printers 
   with (optional) ports and paths:  
   
       ipps://abc.com
       ipps://abc.com/smith/printer
       ipps://abc.com:631/smith/printer
   
   The first and second IPPS URIs above MUST be resolved to port 631
   (IANA assigned well-known port for IPP).  The second and third IPPS
   URIs above are equivalent (see section 4.7 below).

   4.6.2.  IPPS Job URI Examples
   
   The following are examples of well-formed IPPS URIs for IPP Jobs (for
   example, to be used as protocol elements in 'job-uri' attributes of
   'Print-Job' response messages):  
   
       ipps://abc.com/printer/123
       ipps://abc.com/printer/tiger/job123
   
   IPPS Job URIs are valid and meaningful only until Job completion and 
   possibly an implementation defined optional period of persistence
   after Job completion (see IPP Model [RFC2911]).  
   
   Ambiguously, section 4.3.1 'job-uri' of IPP Model [RFC2911] states
   that:  
   
      "the precise format of a Job URI is implementation dependent." 
   
   Thus, the relationship between the value of the "printer-uri"
   operation attribute used in a 'Print-Job' request and the value of
   the "job-uri" attribute returned in the corresponding 'Print-Job'
   response is implementation dependent.  Also, section 4.3.3
   'job-printer-uri' of IPP Model [RFC2911] states that the
   'job-printer-uri' attribute of a Job object:  
   
      "permits a client to identify the Printer object that created this
      Job object when only the Job object's URI is available to the
      client." 
   
   However, the above statement is erroneous, because the transform from
   an IPP Job URI to the corresponding IPP Printer URI is unspecified in
   either IPP/1.1 Model and Semantics [RFC2911] or IPP/1.1 Encoding and 
   Transport [RFC2910].  
   
   IPP Printers that conform to this specification SHOULD only generate 
   IPPS Job URIs (for example, in the "job-uri" attribute in a
   'Print-Job' response) by appending exactly one path component to the
   corresponding IPPS Printer URI (for interoperability).  
   
   
   
   4.7.  IPPS URI Comparisons
   
   When comparing two IPPS URIs to decide if they match or not, an IPP
   Client MUST use the same rules as those defined for HTTP URI
   comparisons in [RFC2616] as updated by HTTPS URI [RFC2818], with the
   sole following exception:

5.  Conformance Requirements

   
   
   5.1.  IPP Client Conformance Requirements
   
   IPP Clients that conform to this specification:  
   
   a) MUST support the IPP over HTTPS transport binding defined in
      section 3.3 and the IPPS URI scheme defined in section 4; 
      
      b) MUST support the IPP over HTTP transport binding that includes
      HTTP Upgrade [RFC2817] defined in section 8.2 'Using IPP with TLS'
      of IPP/1.1 Encoding and Transport [RFC2910] (for interoperability
      with existing IPP implementations); 
      
   c) MUST only send IPP protocol connections to IANA assigned
      well-known port 631 or to the explicit port specified in a given

   d) MUST only send IPPS URIs used as protocol elements in outgoing IPP
      protocol request messages that conform to the ABNF specified in
      section 4.5 'IPPS URI Scheme Syntax' of this document (for
      example, in the "printer-uri" operation attribute in a 'Print-Job'
      request);

   d) MUST NOT listen for incoming IPP protocol connections on any other
      port than IANA-assigned well-known port 631, unless explicitly
      configured by system administrators or site policies; 
      
   e) SHOULD only accept IPPS URIs used as protocol elements in incoming
      IPP protocol request messages that conform to the ABNF specified
      in section 4.5 'IPPS URI Scheme Syntax' of this document (for
      example, in the "printer-uri" operation attribute in a 'Print-Job'
      request);

   g) SHOULD only generate IPPS Job URIs by appending exactly one path
      component to the corresponding IPPS Printer URI (for example, in
      the "job-uri" attribute in a 'Print-Job' response); 
      
   h) SHOULD NOT generate IPPS URIs that use literal IPv6 or IPv4
      addresses.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification updates section 4.1.6 'uriScheme' of IPP/1.1 Model
   and Semantics [RFC2911] by defining and registering with IANA a new
   IPPS URI scheme.  There are no other IANA considerations associated
   with this specification.  
   
   See:  Section 12 'Appendix A - Registration of IPPS URI Scheme'.  



7.  Internationalization Considerations

   IPPS URIs MUST use [RFC3986] encoding, as do their equivalent HTTPS
   URIs [RFC2818].  Characters other than those in the "reserved" set
   [RFC3986] are equivalent to their ""%" HEX HEX" encoding.  
   
   See:  Section 7 'Internationalization Considerations' in [RFC2910].

8.  Security Considerations

   This IPPS URI Scheme specification does not introduce any additional 
   security considerations, beyond those described in [RFC2910],
   [RFC2911], and [RFC2818], except the following:  
   
   a) An IPPS URI might be faked to point to a rogue IPP secure print
      service, thus collecting confidential document contents from IPP
      Clients.  
      
      Server authentication mechanisms and security mechanisms specified
      in the IPP/1.1 Encoding and Transport [RFC2910] and the TLS/1.2
      Protocol [RFC5246] required by this specification and [RFC2818]
      are sufficient to address this threat.  
      
   b) An IPPS URI might be used to access an IPP secure print service by
      an unauthorized IPP Client.  
      
      Client authentication mechanisms and security mechanisms specified
      in the IPP/1.1 Encoding and Transport [RFC2910] and the TLS/1.2
      Protocol [RFC5246] required by this specification and [RFC2818]
      are sufficient to address this threat.  
      
   c) An IPPS URI might be used to access an IPP secure print service at
      a print protocol application layer gateway (for example, an IPP to
      LPD gateway [RFC2569]) causing silent compromise of IPP security
      mechanisms.  
      
      There is no practical defense against this threat by an IPP
      Client.  System administrators should avoid such compromising
      configurations.  
      
   d) An IPPS URI does not define parameters to specify the required IPP
      Client authentication mechanism (for example, 'certificate' as
      defined in section 4.4.2 'uri-authentication-supported' of IPP
      Model [RFC2911]).  
      
      Service discovery or directory protocols should be used to
      discover the required IPP Client authentication mechanisms
      associated with given IPPS URIs.

12.  Appendix A - Registration of IPPS URI Scheme

   Note:  The following section defines the IANA Registration for the
   IPPS URI scheme.  
   
   URI scheme name:  ipps 
      
   Status:  permanent 
      
   URI scheme syntax:  
      
      See:  Section 4.5 'IPPS URI Scheme Syntax' of RFC xxxx.  
      
      [RFC Editor:  Replace 'xxxx' with assigned RFC number before
      publication] 
      
   URI scheme semantics:  
      
      The IPPS URI scheme is used to designate IPP Printer objects
      (spoolers, application gateways, print devices, etc.) on Internet
      hosts accessible using the IPP protocol.  
      
      The associated MIME type is "application/ipp" defined in IPP/1.1
      Model and Semantics [RFC2911] and registered with IANA.  
      
   Encoding Considerations:  
      
      See:  Section 7 'Internationalization Considerations' of RFC xxxx.
      
      [RFC Editor:  Replace 'xxxx' with assigned RFC number before
      publication] 
      
   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:  
      
      The IPPS URI scheme is intended to be used by applications that
      need to access IPP Printers.  Such applications may include (but
      are not limited to) IPP-capable web browsers, IPP Clients that

      wish to print a file, and servers (e.g., print spoolers) that wish
      to forward a print Job for processing.  
      
      An IPPS URI is used to specify the network location of a secure
      print service that supports the IPP/1.1 Encoding and Transport
      [RFC2910], or of a network resource (for example, a print job)
      managed by such a secure print service.  
      
      See:  Section 4.1 'IPPS URI Scheme Applicability' of RFC xxxx.  
      
      [RFC Editor:  Replace 'xxxx' with assigned RFC number before
      publication] 
      
   Interoperability Considerations:  
      
      A widely deployed IPP print service CUPS (on most UNIX, Linux, and
      MacOS client systems) has supported IPPS URIs for several years.
      Current work in progress in the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working Group on
      IPP mobile printing extensions envisions requiring the use of IPPS
      URIs exclusively for data integrity and optional data
      confidentiality.  
      
   Security Considerations:  
      
      See:  Section 8 'Security Considerations' of RFC xxxx.
