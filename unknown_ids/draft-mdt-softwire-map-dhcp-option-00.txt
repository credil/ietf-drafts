             DHCPv6 Options for Mapping of Address and Port
               draft-mdt-softwire-map-dhcp-option-00.txt

Abstract

   Generic mechanism for mapping between an IPv4 prefix, address or
   parts of thereof, and transport layer between ports and an IPv6
   prefix or address is specified in [map-design].  This is a companion
   document that specifies provisioning mechanism of MAP rules.  It
   defines DHCPv6 options which are meant to be used between Customer
   Edge (CE) devices and DHCPv6 server to obtain necessary parameters to
   configure MAP rules.  Since specification of MAP architecture is
   still expected to evolve, DHCPv6 options may have to evolve too to
   fit the revised MAP specification.

Internet-Draft             MAP DHCPv6 Options               October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) defined in [map-design] is a
   mechanism for providing IPv4 connectivity service to end users over a
   service provider's IPv6 network.  It defines MAP Border Relay (BR)
   router that is located that the edge of a MAP domain.  MAP Customer
   Edge (CE) is also defined as a device typically deployed at
   customers' location.  In a residential broadband deployment, this
   type of device is sometimes referred to as a Residential Gateway (RG)
   or Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).  A MAP CE may also be referred
   to simply as a "CE" within the context of MAP.

   A typical MAP CE adopting MAP rules will serve a residential site
   with one WAN side interface, one or more LAN side interfaces.  To
   operate properly, it requires one or more MAP rules and additional
   informations.  In larger networks it is infeasible to configure such
   parameters manually.  Therefore provisioning mechanism is required.
   Such mechanism is defined in this document.  It leverages existing
   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] protocol to deliver necessary parameters to CE.

   This document defines several DHCPv6 options that allow delivery of
   required information to configure CE.  Configuration of the BR is
   outside of scope of this document.  Definitions of used parameters
   are provided in [map-design].

   Since specification of MAP architecture is still expected to evolve,
   DHCPv6 options may have to evolve too to fit the revised MAP
   specification.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Provisioning mechanism

   A typical MAP CE usually acts as a DHCPv6 client and requests options
   that are being provided by a DHCPv6 server located somewhere in ISP
   network.  It would adopt three kinds of parameters independently:

   o  MAP mapping rules are defined in [map-design], including Rule IPv6
      prefix/length, Rule IPv4 prefix and BR IPv6 prefix.  One MAP CE
      can receive one or more MAP mapping rules from the DHCPv6 server,
      the first of which should be the default MAP mapping rule for the
      initiated CE of its own, followed by other mapping rules within

      the MAP domain if necessary.
   o  Transport mode indicates encapsulation or translation mode for MAP
      approach.  It should be conducted on interface-by-interface basis
   o  Discussion: Qiong also proposed to add deployment mode here.
      Jacni Qin recommends against it.  Deployment mode is to notify
      whether CE is in Hub and spoke mode or mesh.  In Hub and spoke
      mode, only the first default MAP mapping rule is needed in the
      following MAP procedure.  While in mesh mode, all MAP mapping
      rules are included to achieve CE-CE traffic optimization.


4.  DHCPv6 Options Format

   DHCPv6 protocol is used for CE provisioning.  Several new options are
   defined for conveying MAP-specific parameters.  Their format and
   usage is defined in the following sections.

   Discussion: As the exact parameters required to configure MAP rules
   and MAP in general are expected to change, this section is expected
   to be updated or even rewritten completely.

   Discussion: Proposed layout assumes that several simple options are
   used.  Such approach simplifies implementation as it is much easier
   for implementors to reuse existing code handling such options.  This
   design choice comes at a cost, however.  Clients must perform checks
   if provided set of options is complete.  Alternatively, it would be
   possible to define one complex option that contains all mandatory
   parameters.

   Discussion: It should be noted that initial concept of 4rd
   provisioning was presented in DHC working group meeting.  It used one
   complex option to convey all required parameters.  Strong suggestion
   from DHC WG was to use several simpler options.  Options (possibly
   nested) are preferred over conditional option formatting.  See DHCP
   option guidelines document [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines]).

4.1.  MAP Options Cardinality

   MAP rule is defined in [map-design], Section 4.

   Discussion: If you want additional parameter added to the
   OPTION_MAP_RULE option, please update [map-design] first.

   In each REPLY message, server that supports MAP configuration MUST
   include exactly one OPTION_MAP_FLAGS option.

   MAP_FLAGS option MUST include one or more OPTION_MAP_RULE options.

Internet-Draft             MAP DHCPv6 Options               October 2011


   For proper operation, additional parameters obtained via other
   options are necessary.  In particular, L parameter is equal to a
   length of a prefix delegated to CE, conveyed in OPTION_IA_PD and
   IAPREFIX, as defined in [RFC3633].

4.2.  MAP Flags Option

   .  This option specifies MAP flags.  Currently the only defined flag
   is T - transport mode. 0 designates translation and 1 designates
   encapsulation.

   Each MAP_FLAGS option MUST contain one or more MAP Rule Options.


                        TODO: Add format here later


                        Figure 1: MAP Flags Option

   option-code: OPTION_MAP_FLAGS (TBD)

4.3.  MAP Rule Option

   This option represents a single MAP Rule.  Depending on deployment
   mode, each CE may require one or more MAP Rules to operate properly.

   Server includes one or more MAP Rule Options in MAP Flags option.

   Discussion: Do we need to distinguish or reference rules? (i.e.  Is
   some kind of ID field required?)

   Server MAY send more than one MAP Rule Option, if it is configured to
   do so.  Clients MUST NOT send MAP Rule Option.

   DHCPv6 server provisioning a single MAP Rule to a CE (DHCPv6 client)
   will convey the following MAP options in its messages:

                                  <MAP_RULE1/>
                                  <MAP_RULE2/>
                                  ...
                                  <MAP_RULEN/>
                              </MAP_FLAGS>

5.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   RFC 3315 Section 17.2.2 [RFC3315] describes how a DHCPv6 client and
   server negotiate configuration values using the ORO.  As a
   convenience to the reader, we mention here that a server will not
   reply with a MAP Rule Option if the client has not explicitly
   enumerated it on its Option Request Option.

   Server conformant to this specification MUST allow configuration of
   one or more MAP Rule Options.

   Server MUST transmist all configured instances of the Mapping Rule
   Options with all sub-options, if client requested it using
   OPTION_MAP_RULE in its Option Request Option (ORO).  Server MUST
   transmit MAP Flags Option if client requested OPTION_MAP_FLAGS in its
   ORO.

   Rules assignment is a stateless process from the server's
   perspective.  Server does not need to maintain a state of rules
   provisioned to clients, track lifetimes, expire outdated rules etc.
   Server SHOULDs assign the same set of rules to all CEs in one MAP
   Domain, unless there are several classes of CEs defined, e.g. regular
   and premium users.  In such case, each class of CEs is expected to
   get the same set of rules.  Server is not expected to track MAP rules
   on a per CE basis.  Exact assignment of specific rules to a specific
   CEs is outside of scope of this document.


6.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   Although other use cases are allowed, in typical use case CE will act
   as DHCPv6 client and will request MAP configuration to be assigned by
   the DHCPv6 server located in the ISP network.  A client that supports
   MAP CE functionality and conforms to this specfication MUST include
   OPTION_MAP_RULE and OPTION_MAP_FLAGS in its ORO.

   For proper operation, MAP CE client MUST also request IPv6 address
   (OPTION_IA_NA, defined in [RFC3315]) and prefix delegation
   (OPTION_IA_PD, defined in [RFC3633]).  MAP CE client SHOULD NOT
   initiate DHCPv4 configuration as all parameters are delivered over
   DHCPv6.

   Client SHOULD request OPTION_MAP_RULE and OPTION_MAP_FLAGS options in
   SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW, REBIND and INFORMATION-REQUEST messages.

   If client receives more than one OPTION_MAP_RULE option, it MUST use
   all received instances.  It MUST NOT use only the first one, while
   discarding remaining ones.

Internet-Draft             MAP DHCPv6 Options               October 2011


   Note that system implementing MAP CE functionality may have multiple
   network interfaces, and these interfaces may be configured
   differently; some may be connected to networks that call for MAP, and
   some may be connected to networks that are using normal dual stack or
   other means.  The MAP CE system should approach this specification on
   an interface-by-interface basis.  For example, if the CE system is
   attached to multiple networks that provide the MAP Mapping Rule
   Option, then the CE system MUST configure a MAP connection (i.e. a
   translation or encapsulation) for each interface separately as each
   MAP provides IPv4 connectivity for each distinct interface.  Means to
   bind a MAP configuration to a given interface in a multiple
   interfaces device are out of scope of this document.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not require any IANA actions.


8.  Security Considerations

   Implementation of this document does not present any new security
   issues, but as with all DHCPv6-derived configuration state, it is
   completely possible that the configuration is being delivered by a
   third party (Man In The Middle).  As such, there is no basis to trust
   that the access over the MAP can be trusted, and it should not
   therefore bypass any security mechanisms such as IP firewalls.

   Readers concerned with security of MAP provisioning over DHCPv6 are
   encouraged to familiarize with [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6].

   Section XX of [map-design] discusses security issues of the MAP
   mechanism.

   Section 23 of [RFC3315] discusses DHCPv6-related security issues.

   Section 6 of [I-D.murakami-softwire-4rd] discusses 4rd related
   security issues that are partially applicable to MAP mechanism.


9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate DHCPv6 option codes referencing this
   document, delineating OPTION_MAP_RULE, OPTION_MAP_BR_PREFIX6,
   OPTION_MAP_PREFIX6, OPTION_MAP_PREFIX4 and OPTION_MAP_FLAGS option
   names.
