                Localized Routing for Proxy Mobile IPv6
                    draft-krishnan-netext-pmip-lr-01

Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network based mobility management
   protocol that enables IP mobility for a host without requiring its
   participation in any mobility-related signaling.  PMIPv6 requires all
   communications to go through the local mobility anchor.  As this can
   be suboptimal, localized routing allows mobile nodes attached to the
   same or different mobile access gateways to exchange traffic by using
   localized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the gateways.  This
   document proposes an initiation mechanism for localized routing.

Internet-Draft          PMIPv6 Localized Routing              March 2010


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] describes the protocol operations to
   maintain reachability and session persistence for a Mobile Node (MN)
   without the explicit participation from the MN in signaling
   operations at the Internet Protocol (IP) layer.  In order to
   facilitate such network-based mobility, the PMIPv6 protocol defines a
   Mobile Access Gateway (MAG), which acts as a proxy for the Mobile
   IPv6 [RFC3775] signaling, and the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) which
   acts similar to a Home Agent.  The LMA and the MAG estalish a
   bidirectional tunnel for forwarding all data traffic belonging to the
   Mobile Nodes.  In the case where both endpoints are located in the
   same PMIPv6 domain, this can be suboptimal and results in higher
   delay and congestion in the network.  Moreover, it increases
   transport costs and traffic load at the LMA.

   To overcome these issues, localized routing can be used to allow
   nodes attached to the same or different MAGs to directly exchange
   traffic by using localized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the
   gateways.  [LR-PS] defines the problem statement for PMIPv6 localized
   routing.  This document describes a solution for PMIPv6 localized
   routing.  The protocol specified here assumes that each MN is
   attached to a MAG and that each MN's MAG has established a binding
   for the attached MN at its selected LMA according to [RFC5213].


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Scenario A11: Two MNs attached to the same MAG and LMA

   In this scenario, the two Mobile Nodes involved in communication are
   attached to a single MAG and both are anchored at the same LMA.

   The LMA initiates a localized routing session by detecting a flow
   between two MNs attached to the same MAG.  The exact flow
   identification mechanism is not specified in this document, and is
   left open for implementations and specific deployments.  An example
   trigger could be that an application-layer signaling entity (such as
   a SIP Proxy) notifies the LMA about two VoIP flow end-points, and the
   latter determines that the two end-points are attached to the same
   MAG.  Such a trigger mechanism offers localized routing at the
   granularity of an individual application session, providing
   flexibility in usage.  This and other possible examples serve to
   illustrate the trigger mechanism for initiating localized routing.

   After detecting a possibility for localized routing, the LMA
   constructs a Localized Routing Initiation (LRI) message that is used
   to signal the intent to initiate localized routing and to convey
   parameters for the same.  This is a Mobility Header message and it
   contains the MN-Identifier and the Home Network Prefix (as Mobility
   Header options) for each of the MNs involved.  The LMA sends the LRI
   message to the MAG where the two MNs are attached.

   The MAG starts by verifying that the two MNs are indeed attached to
   it.  It then verifies if the EnableMAGLocalRouting flag is set to 1.
   If it is not, the MAG is not configured to allow localized routing
   and it will reject the LRI and send an LRA with status code
   "Localized Routing Not Allowed".  It then creates Localized Routing
   Entries(LREs) for each direction of the communication between the two
   MNs.  The exact form of the forwarding entries is left for the
   implementations to decide; however, they should contain the HNP
   corresponding to the destination IP address and a next-hop identifier
   (e.g. the layer 2 address of the next- hop).  These LREs MUST
   override the BUL entries for the specific HNPs identified in the LRI
   message.  Hence all traffic matching the HNPs is forwarded locally.

   If a MAG is unable to make deliver packets using the LREs, it is



Krishnan, et al.        Expires September 9, 2010               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          PMIPv6 Localized Routing              March 2010


   possible that the MN is no longer attached to the MAG.  Hence, the
   MAG SHOULD fall back to using the BUL entry, and the LMA MUST forward
   the received packets using its BCE.

   The local forwarding is not permanent.  For instance, the LMA may
   send a LRI message with a request to cancel an existing local
   forwarding service.  The local forwarding also has a default
   lifetime, upon the expiry of which, the forwarding reverts to
   bidirectional tunneling.  When local forwarding service ceases, the
   corresponding LFE entries MUST be removed.

   The MAG completes the processing of the LRI message and responds with
   a Local Routing Acknowledgment (LRA) message.  This Mobility Header
   message also includes the MN-ID and the HNP for each of the
   communicating MNs as well as an appropriate Status code indicating
   the outcome of LRI processing.  Status code 0 indicates localized
   routing was successfully offered by the MAG.  Any other value for
   Status code indicates the reason for the failure to offer localized
   routing service.  When Status code is 0, the LMA sets a flag in the
   BCE corresponding to the HNPs to record that localized routing is in
   progress for that HNP.

   The MAG may refresh the lifetime of an existing local forwarding
   service.  For this, it sends an unsolicited LRA (U-LRA) message that
   contains the new lifetime value.  The MAG MUST wait for the following
   LRI message from the LMA before it can conclude that the refresh
   request is granted.

3.1.  Handover Considerations

   If one of the MNs, say MN1, detaches from the MAG and attaches to
   another MAG(say nMAG) the localized routing state needs to be re-
   established.  When the LMA receives the PBU from nMAG for MN1, it
   will see that localized routing is active for for MN1.  It will hence
   initiate LR at nMAG and update the LR state of MAG.  After the
   handover completes, the localized routing will resemble Scenario A21.


4.  Scenario A21: Two MNs attached to different MAGs but same LMA

   The LMA may choose to support local forwarding to mobile nodes
   attached to two different MAGs within a single PMIPv6 domain.

                   +---+       +---+

   As earlier, the LMA initiates LRI as a response to some trigger
   mechanism.  In this case, however, it sends two separate LRI messages
   to the two MAGs.  In addition to the MN-ID and the HNP options, each
   LRI message contains the IP Address of the counterpart MAG.  When the
   MAG IP Address option is present, each MAG MUST create a local
   forwarding entry such that the packets for the MN attached to the
   remote MAG are sent over a tunnel associated with that remote MAG.
   The tunnel between the MAGs is assumed to be established by means
   outside the scope of this document.

   As before, each MAG responds to the LRI with an LRA message.  Barring
   the error cases, all subsequent packets are routed between the MAGs
   locally, without traversing the LMA.

   The protocol does not require any synchronization between the MAGs
   before local forwarding begins.  Each MAG begins its local forwarding
   independent of the other.

4.1.  Handover Considerations

   If one of the MNs, say MN1, detaches from its current MAG (in this
   case MAG1) and attaches to another MAG (say nMAG1) the localized
   routing state needs to be re-established.  When the LMA receives the
   PBU from nMAG1 for MN1, it will see that localized routing is active
   for for MN1.  It will hence initiate LR at nMAG1 and update the LR
   state of MAG2 to use nMAG1 instead of MAG1.

5.  Scenario A12: Two MNs attached to the same MAG with different LMAs

   In this scenario, both the MNs are attached to the same MAG, but are
   anchored at two different LMAs.


                        Internet
                  :                  :

                  |                  |
                  |                  |
                  +------------------+
                           |
                           |
                           |
                        +-----+
                        | MAG |
                        +-----+
                         :   :
                      +---+ +---+
                      |MN1| |MN2|
                      +---+ +---+

   Hence, neither LMA has a means to determine that the two Mobile Nodes
   are attached to the same MAG.  Only the MAG can possibly determine
   that the two Mobile Nodes involved in communication are attached to
   it.  Hence the local routing has to be initiated by the MAG.

   The MAG sends an LRI message containing the MN-ID, HNP and the
   counterpart LMA address to each LMA.  Each LMA makes decision to
   support local forwarding independently, based on, among others,
   policy configuration for the counterpart LMA.  Each LMA MUST respond
   to the LRI message with an LRA message.  Only after it receives both
   the LRA messages each with Status value set to zero (success) from
   the two different LMAs, the MAG MUST conclude that it can provide
   local forwarding support for the two Mobile Nodes.

5.1.  Handover Considerations

   If one of the MNs, say MN1, detaches from its current MAG (in this
   case MAG1) and attaches to another MAG (say nMAG1) the localized
   routing state needs to be re-established.  After the handover
   completes, the localized routing will resemble Scenario A22.


6.  Scenario A22: Two MNs attached to the different MAGs with different
    LMAs

   This scenario has been left out of this version of the draft due to
   lack of time and will be covered in later versions of this draft.

7.  IPv4 support in Localized Routing

   PMIPv6 MNs can use an IPv4 HoA as described in
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].  In order to support the setup
   and maintenance of localized routes for these IPv4 HoAs in PMIPv6,
   MAGs must add the IPv4 HoAs into their LREs.  The MAGs MUST also
   support encapsulation of IPv4 packets as described in
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].  The localized routing protocol
   messages MUST include a IPv4 HoA option in their signaling messages
   in order to support IPv4 addresses for localized routing.

   If the transport network between the PMIPv6 entitites involved in
   localized routing is IPv4-only, the LRI and LRA messages MUST be
   encapsulated similar to the PBU/PBA messages as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-netlmm-pmip6-ipv4-support].  The encapsulation mode used
   SHOULD be identical to the one used to transport PBU and PBA
   messages.


8.  Message Formats

8.1.  Localized Routing Initiation (LRI)

   The LMA sends an LRI message to a MAG to request local forwarding for
   a pair of MNs.  The MAG may also send this message to request the two
   LMAs for offering local forwarding as described in Section 5 .

      Sequence Number: A monotonically increasing integer.  Set by a
      sending node in a request message, and used to match a reply to
      the request.

      'R' flag: Set to 0, indicates it is an LRI message.

      'S' flag: When set to 1, indicates a request to stop local
      routing.

      Reserved: This field is unused.  MUST be set zero.

      Lifetime: The requested time in seconds for which the sender
      wishes to have local forwarding.

      Mobility Options: MUST contain the MN-ID, followed by one or more
      HNPs for each of the MNs.  For instance, for Mobile Nodes MN-1 and
      MN-2 with identifiers MN-ID1, MN-ID2 and Home Network Prefixes
      HNP-MN-1 and HNP-MN-2, the following tuple in the following order
      MUST be present: [MN-ID1, HNP-MN-1], [MN-ID2, HNP-MN-2].  The
      MN-ID and HNP options are the same as in [RFC5213].  MAY contain
      the remote MAG IPv6 address option, which is identical to the HNP
      option except for Prefix Length equal to 128 bits.  MAY contain
      the LMA IPv6 address option, which is identical to the HNP
      option except for Prefix Length equal to 128 bits.


   The LRI message SHOULD be re-transmitted if a corresponding LRA
   message is not received within LRA_WAIT_TIME time units, up to a
   maximum of LRI_RETRIES, each separated by LRA_WAIT_TIME time units.

8.2.  Localized Routing Acknowledgment (LRA)

   A MAG sends an LRA message to the LMA as a response to the LRI
   message.  An LMA may also send this message to a MAG as a response to

      Sequence Number: is copied from the sequence number field of the
      LRI message being responded to.

      'R' flag: Set to 1, indicates it is an LRA message.

      'U' flag: When set to 1, the LRA message is sent unsolicited.
      The Lifetime field indicates a new requested value.  The MAG MUST
      wait for the regular LRI message to confirm that the request is
      acceptable to the LMA.

      Reserved: This field is unused.  MUST be set zero.

      Status:


         0: Success

         128: Localized Routing Not Allowed
         129: MN not attached

      Lifetime: The time in seconds for which the local forwarding is
      supported.  Typically copied from the corresponding field in the
      LRI message.

      Mobility Options: When Status code is 0, MUST contain the [MN-ID,
      HNP] tuples in the same order as in the LRI message.  When Status
      code is 1, MUST contain only those [MN-ID, HNP] tuples for which
      local forwarding is supported.  The MN-ID and HNP options are the
      same as in [RFC5213].

9.  Security Considerations

   The protocol specified in this document uses the same security
   association between the LMA and the MAG to protect the LRI and LRA
   messages.  No new security risks are identified.  Support for
   integrity protection using IPsec is required, but support for
   confidentiality is not necessary.


10.  IANA Considerations

   The Localized Routing Initiation, described in Section 8.1 and the
   Local Routing Acknowledgment, described in Section 8.2 require a
   single Mobility Header Type from the Mobility Header Types registry
   at http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobility-parameters

   The MAG IPv6 Address and the LMA IPv6 Address require a Mobility
   Option Type each from the Mobility Options registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobility-parameters
