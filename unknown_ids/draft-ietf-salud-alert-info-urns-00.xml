    <abstract>
      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to
      provide a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the UA when
      the user is alerted. This is done using the Alert-Info header. However,
      the reference addresses only network resources with specific rendering
      properties. There is currently no support for predefined standard
      identifiers for describing the semantics of the alerting situation or
      the characteristics of the alerting signal, without being tied to a
      particular rendering. To overcome this limitation and support new
      applications, a new family of URNs for use in SIP Alert-Info header
      fields is defined in this specification.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="Motivation">
        <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref
        target="RFC3261"></xref> allows for user agent servers (UAS) and
        proxies to provide the specific ringback or ring tone to the user
        agent (UA). In  <xref
      target="RFC3261"></xref> this is done by including a URI reference in
        the Alert-Info header field, that points to the tone. The URI
        reference is most commonly the HTTP URI to the audio file. On the
        receipt of the Alert-Info header the user agent may fetch the
        referenced ringback or ring tone and play it to the user.</t>

        <t>This mechanism does not ensure interoperability when there is no
        common understanding of the referenced content (different countries or
        vendors, hearing impaired) or when the user wants his own tones
        configured in the end device. If caller and callee are from 
        different countries, the understanding of the tones may vary
        significantly. Hearing impaired users may not sense the specific tone
        if it is provided as an audio file. The tone per se is also not useful
        for automata.</t>

        <t>There are currently interoperability issues around the use of the
        Alert-Info header field when not using an external ring file. For
        example, consider the PBX special ring tone for an external (to the
        PBX) caller. Different vendors use different approaches such as:
        Alert-Info: &lt;file://ring.pcm&gt;;alert=normal where ring.pcm is a
        dummy file or: Alert-Info: &lt;file://normal.ring.pcm&gt; or:
        Alert-Info: &lt;sip:normal-ringtone@example.com&gt;. As a result,
        Alert-Info currently only works when the same vendor provides proxy
        and UA, as only then is the same "fake" proprietary URI convention
        used.</t>

        <t>Another limitation of the current solution is that the referenced
        tones are tied to particular rendering. It is not possible to provide
        semantic indications or names for rendering characteristics that
        signals the intent and allows the recipient to decide how to render
        the received information in an appropriate way.</t>

        <t>To solve the described issues, this specification defines the new
        URN namespace 'alert' for the Alert-Info header that allows for
        programmatic user interface adaptation and for conversion of equivalent
        alerting tones in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) when
        the client is a gateway. The work to standardize an Alert-Info URN
        will increase SIP interoperability for this header field by replacing
        proprietary conventions used today.</t>

        <t>Using the 'alert' namespace provides syntax for several different
        application spaces, e. g.:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Names for service indications, such as call waiting or
            automatic callback, not tied to any particular rendering.</t>

            <t>Names for common ring tones generated by PBX phones for cases
            such as an internal enterprise caller, external caller, ringback
            after a transfer failure or expiration of a hold timer, etc.</t>

            <t>Names for country-specific ringback tones.</t>

            <t>Names for things with specific renderings that aren't purely
            audio. They might be static icons, video sequences, text, etc.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Some advantages of a URN rather than a URI reference to a
        downloadable resource:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Do not need to download it or deal with security issues
            associated with dereferencing.</t>

            <t>No formatting or compatibility issues.</t>

            <t>No security risk of rendering something unexpected and
            undesirable.</t>

            <t>The tone can be stored locally in whatever format and at
            whatever quality level is appropriate, because it is specified "by
            name" rather than "by value".</t>

            <t>It is easier to make policy decisions about whether to use it
            or not.</t>

            <t>It facilitates translation for the hearing impaired.</t>
          </list>The downside is that if the recipient does not understand the
        URN then it will only be able to render a default ringback or
        ring tone. To provide the general awareness about the Alert-Info URNs
        this document provides IANA template for registering the URNs and
        defines several typical identifiers.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Alert-Info Header Usage Change">
        <t>This specification changes the usage of the SIP Alert-Info header
        defined in the  <xref
      target="RFC3261"></xref>. The Alert-Info header can be used in INVITE
        requests and in provisional 1xx responses excepting the 100 response. Backward compatibility 
       issues are not expected,  devices that do not understand an Alert-Info URN ignore it.
        
</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles
        played by participants in, and objects of, the SIP Alerting for User
        Devices. A "specifier" sends an "indication" or "identifier" (a URN in
        an Alert-Info header) to a "renderer" which then "renders" a "signal"
        or "rendering" based on the indication to a human user. A "category"
        is a characteristic whose "values" can be used to classify
        indications.</t>

       <t>This specification uses the terms "ring tone" and "ringback 
      tone".  A "ring tone"  or "calling signal" (terminology used in <xref
        target="ITU-T E.182"></xref>) is a signal generated by the 
      callee's end device, advising the callee about an incoming call. 
      A "ringback tone" or 
      "ringing tone" (terminology used in <xref
        target="ITU-T E.182"></xref>) is a signal advising the caller that 
       a connection has 
      been made and that a ring tone is being rendered to the callee.   
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements">
      <t>This section discusses the requirements for an identifier to
      transport the semantics of the signaling situation or the
      characteristics of the rendering.</t>

      <t>REQ-1: The mechanism will allow user agents (UAs) and proxies to
      provide in the Alert-Info SIP-header an indication which describes the
      semantics of the signaling situation or the characteristics of the
      rendering and allows the recipient to decide how to render the received
      information to the user.</t>

      <t>REQ-2: The mechanism will allow the identifier to be specified "by
      name" rather than "by value", to enable local policy decisions whether
      to use it or not.</t>

      <t>REQ-3: Indications must be able to represent a wide variety of
      signals, which have many largely-orthogonal characteristics.</t>

      <t>REQ-4: Indications include subsets which have distinctly different
      semantics, that is, they form disjoint "value spaces". For example, some
      indications should describe the semantics of the signaling situation
      whereas others should describe the audio characteristics of the signal.
      This implies that there is no single set of categories that can be used
      as independent coordinates of the value-space of indications.</t>

      <t>REQ-5: The set of indications must be able to support extensibility
      by a wide variety of organizations that are not coordinated with each
      other. Extensions must be able to: <t>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="- add further values to any existing category " />

            <t hangText="- add further categories that are orthogonal to existing categories " />

            <t hangText="- semantically subdivide the meaning provided by any existing indication" />

            <t hangText="- add further value spaces of indications whose semantics are not related to existing indications, and thus, whose categories differ from and do not interact with existing categories." />
          </list>
        </t> REQ-6: The mechanism will be flexible, so new identifiers can be
      defined in the future, when SIP-applications evolve. E. g. Alert-Info
      URNs could identify specific media by name, such as "Beethoven's Fifth",
      and the end device could render some small part of it as a ring
      tone.</t>

      <t>REQ-7: An indication is transmitted from a specifier to a renderer,
      which must base its rendering decision only on the indication. In
      particular, there is no multi-message negotiation process or carrying of
      context from one indication to the next.</t>

      <t>REQ-8: The mechanism will allow transmission in the Alert-Info header
      of SIP INVITE requests and provisional 1xx responses excepting the 100 responses.</t>

      <t>REQ-9: The renderer may be customized in ways that limit the set of
      signals that it can render, or it may be provided with a set of signals
      that have uncommon semantics. (The canonical example is a UA for the
      hearing-impaired.) (By REQ-7, the renderer has no way of transmitting
      this fact to the specifier.)</t>

      <t>REQ-10: If the specifier and the renderer have designs that are
      properly coordinated, the indications must be able to reliably carry all
      extensions that are supported in the coordinated designs. In any other
      situation, it is not required from the renderer to perform the best
      possible rendering.</t>

      <t>REQ-11: In any situation, the renderer must be able to perform close
      to the best possible rendering that it could do even the specifier had
      specific knowledge of the renderer's capabilities.</t>

      <t>REQ-12: The mechanism will allow interoperability for services as
      call waiting, forward, transfer-recall, auto-callback,
      hold-recall.</t>

      <t>REQ-13: The mechanism will allow rendering common PBX ring tone
      types.</t>

      <t>REQ-14: The mechanism will allow rendering specific country ringback
      tones.</t>

      <t>REQ-15: The mechanism will allow rendering tones for emergency
      alerts. (Use cases  and values definition are not subject of this specification.)</t>

      <t>REQ-16: The mechanism will allow rendering using other means than
      tones, e.g. text or images.</t>

      <t>REQ-17: The mechanism will allow TDM gateways to map
      ring/ringback tones from legacy protocols to SIP at the edge of a
      network, e.g. national ring tones as defined in TIA/EIA-41-D and 3GPP2 A.S0014.  
      (Use cases  and values definition are not subject of this specification.)
     </t>

      <t>REQ-18: The mechanism must ensure that an UA receiving Alert-Info
      URNs or portions of an Alert-Info URN it does not understand, it can
      ignore them.</t>

      <t>REQ-19: The mechanism will allow storage of the actual encoding
      locally rather than fetching it.</t>

    <section anchor="Use Cases" title="Use Cases">
      <t>This section describes some use cases for which the Alert-Info URN
      mechanism is needed today. </t>

      <section anchor="PBX_Tones" title="PBX Ring Tones">
        <t>This section defines some commonly encountered ring tones on PBX
        or business phones. They are as follows:</t>

        <section title="normal">
          <t>This tone indicates that the default or normal ring tone
          should be rendered. This is essentially a no-operation Alert-Info
          URN and should be treated by the UA as if no Alert-Info URN is
          present. This is most useful when Alert-Info header field parameters
          are being used. For example, in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances"></xref>, an Alert-Info
          header field needs to be present containing the "appearance"
          parameter, but no special ring tone needs to be specified.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="external">
          <t>This tone is used to indicate that the caller is external to the
          enterprise or PBX system. This could be a call from the PSTN or from
          a SIP trunk.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="internal">
          <t>This tone is used to indicate that the caller is internal to the
          enterprise or PBX system. The call could have been originated from
          another user on this PBX or on another PBX within the
          enterprise.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="priority">
          <t>A PBX tone needs to indicate that a priority level alert should
          be applied for the type of alerting specified (e.g. internal
          alerting).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="short ">
          <t>In this case the alerting type specified (e.g. internal alerting)
          should be rendered shorter than normal. In contact centers, this is
          sometimes referred to as "abbreviated ringing" or a "zip tone".</t>
        </section>

        <section title="delayed">
          <t>In this case the alerting type specified should be rendered after
          a short delay. In some bridged line/shared line appearance
          implementations, this is used so that the bridged line does not ring
          at exactly the same time as the main line, but is delayed a few
          seconds.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Service Tones" title="Service Tones">
        <t>These tones are used to indicate specific PBX and public network
        telephony services.</t>

        <section title="call-waiting">
          <t>The Call Waiting
           Service <xref target="TS24.615"></xref> permits
          a callee to be notified of an incoming call while the callee is
          engaged in an active or held call. Subsequently, the callee can
          either accept, reject, or ignore the incoming call. There is an
          interest on the caller side to be informed about the call waiting
          situation on the callee side. Having this information the caller can
          decide whether to continue waiting for callee to pickup or better to
          call some time later when it is estimated that the callee could have
          finished the ongoing conversation. To provide this information, the
          callee's UAS ( or proxy) aware of the call waiting condition can add
          the call-waiting indication to the Alert-Info header in the 180
          Ringing response. As call-waiting information may be subject to the
          callee's privacy concerns, the exposure of this information SHALL be
          done only if explicitly required by the user.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="forward">
          <t>This feature is used in a 180 Ringing response when a call
          forwarding feature has been initiated on an INVITE. Many PBX system
          implement a forwarding "beep" followed by normal ringing to indicate
          this. Note that a 181 response can be used in place of this URN.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="transfer-recall">
          <t>This feature is used when a blind transfer <xref
          target="RFC5589"></xref> has been performed by a server on behalf of
          the transferor and fails. Instead of failing the call, the server
          calls back the transferor, giving them another chance to transfer or
          otherwise deal with the call. This service tone is used to
          distinguish this INVITE from any other normal incoming call.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="auto-callback">
          <t>This feature is used when a user has utilized a server to
          implement an automatic callback service. When the user is available,
          the server calls back the user and utilizes this service tone to
          distinguish this from any other normal incoming call.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="hold-recall">
          <t>This feature is used when a server implements a call hold timer
          on behalf of an endpoint. After a certain period of time of being on
          hold, the user who placed the call on hold is alerted to either
          retrieve the call or otherwise dispose of the call. This service
          tone is used to distinguish this case from any other normal incoming
          call.</t>

               title="Country-specific ringback tone indications for the public telephone network">
        <t>In the PSTN, different tones are used in different countries. End

          <t>The Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the "alert" URNs is
          called alert-identifier and has a hierarchical structure. The
          left-most label is called "alert-category" and is separated from
          the right-side of the alert-identifier, the alert-indication, by a
          colon. The general form is
          urn:alert:{alert-category}:{alert-indication}.</t>

          <t>In this specification, following alert-categories identifiers are
          described: "service" , "priority" , "source" , "duration", "delay"
          and "locale". The alert-category set can be extended in the
          future.</t>

          <t>The categories are orthogonal. Any Alert-Info URN defined in this
          specification is syntactically valid for ring and ringback tones
          and can be used in INVITE requests or in provisional 1xx responses
          excepting the 100 response.</t>

          <t>The alert-indications are hierarchical identifiers, consisting of
          one label or a sequence of labels separated by periods. 
          The set of allowable characters is the same as that for domain names
          <xref target="RFC1123" />. Labels are case-insensitive, but MUST be
          specified in all lower-case.</t>

          <t>The ABNF <xref target="RFC5234" /> for the Alert -Info URNs is

          <t hangText="Community considerations:">The alert URN is believed to
          be relevant to a large cross-section of Internet users, including
          both technical and non-technical users, on a variety of devices and
          with a variety of perception capabilities. The 'alert' URN will
          allow Internet users to receive more information and enable them to
          better make decisions about accepting an offered call, or get better
          feedback on the progress of a call they have made. User interfaces
          for the perception impaired users can better render the ringback
          indication based on the Alert-Info URN. The assignment of
          identifiers is described in <xref target="IANA" />. The Alert-Info
          URN does not prescribe a particular resolution mechanism, but it is
          assumed that a number of different entities could operate and offer
          such mechanisms.</t>

          <t hangText="Namespace considerations:">There do not appear to be
          other URN namespaces that serve the same need of uniquely
          identifying 'alert' communication and information services.</t>

          URN identifies a logical service or tone, specified in the
          alert-indication registration (see <xref target="IANA" />).
          Resolution of the registered URN will return a particular instance
          of the alert identifier. Alert identifier URNs MUST be unique for
          each unique indication; this is guaranteed through the registration
          of each alert indication within this namespace, described in <xref
          target="IANA" />.</t>

          <t hangText="Identifier persistence considerations:">The Alert-Info
          URN for the same indication is expected to be persistent, as long as
          it is registered with IANA.</t>

          <t hangText="Process of identifier assignment:">The process of
          identifier assignment is described in <xref target="IANA" />.</t>

          <t hangText="Process for identifier resolution:">'Alert-Info URNs

      <t>The "private.&lt;private-name&gt;" syntax is for extensions
        specific to independent organizations. The "&lt;private-name&gt;" is
        used in the form of a "reverse FQDN" such as is used for Java package
        names. This gives a way of assigning unique names without the need for
        a new registry. The namespace for each alert category is independent.
        Those assigning new names must ensure they are in a position to assign
        names uniquely for the FQDN they choose. For example, a private
        company might want to define:
        urn:alert:source:private.com.example.customer</t>
        <t>Adding new categories and adding alert-indication values other than
        via the "private" mechanism is standards action.</t>

   </section>

    <section anchor="Combinations" title="Combinations of URNs">
       <t>This chapter only describes combination rules for the case when all
       the Alert-Info headers only contain Alert-Info URNs. Combinations of URNs
       and URIs in the Alert-Info headers of the same SIP-message are not
       defined in this specification.</t>

     <t>In many cases, more than one URNs will be needed to fully define a
      particular tone. This is done by including multiple Alert-Info URNs, in
      one or more Alert-Info headers in a request or a response.  For
      example, an internal, priority call could be indicated by Alert-Info:
      &lt;urn:alert:source:internal&gt;, &lt;urn:alert:priority:high&gt;. A
      priority call waiting tone could be indicated by Alert-Info:
      &lt;urn:alert:service:call-waiting&gt;,
      &lt;urn:alert:priority:high&gt;.</t>

      <t>The categories are orthogonal.  Any Alert-Info URN defined in this
      specification is syntactically valid for ring and for ringback and can
     be used in an INVITE or in provisional 1xx responses excepting the 100
     response.  There MUST be at most one instance of each alert-category
     in the Alert-Info header(s) of a request or response. In principle any
    combination of Alert-Info URNs with different "alert-category" is
    valid and can be used for either ring or ringback, though some
     combinations may not make sense.</t>

    <t>The receiving UA should make the decision about what to render to the
     user and what device it is rendered on depending on the value of the
     Alert-Info header(s) content and of the kind of the received message
    (INVITE or provisional response).  Typically, the same UA will do the
    rendering of one or more particular Alert-Info header(s) content
     received in an INVITE differently from the rendering of the same
     Alert-Info header(s) content received in a provisional response. </t>

     <t>The exact way in which the various categories are combined for
     rendering is left as an implementation issue.  The implementation is
     free to ignore any or all parts of the received Alert-Info URNs.</t>

    <section anchor="User Agent Behaviour" title="User Agent Behaviour">
      <t>Upon receiving a SIP INVITE request or a SIP provisional response
      with an Alert-Info header that contains a single or multiple Alert-Info
      URNs, the User Agent (UA) attempts to match the received Alert-Info URNs
      with the known indications or indication combinations. The User Agent
      (UA) ignores the Alert-Info URNs for which no match is found and
      proceeds with the normal operation. If one or multiple URNs match(es) a
      known indication or a known indication combination, the User Agent (UA)
      renders the indication or the indication combination to the user
      accordingly. The User Agent (UA) is responsible for the non disturbing
      rendering if multiple indications and network resources are to be
      rendered simultaneously.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Proxy Behaviour" title="Proxy Behaviour">
      <t></t>

      <t>A SIP proxy MAY add a URN or multiple URNs to the Alert-Info header
      in a SIP request or a provisional 1xx response excepting 100 response when it needs
      to provide additional information about the call or about the provided
      service. A SIP Proxy SHOULD NOT add a mixture of Alert-Info URNs and URIs
      to the Alert-Info header that may cause disturbing rendering
      interference at the recipient's User Agent (UA).</t>

      <t>Following example shows both the network audio resource referenced by
      the HTTP URI and the URN indication for the call-waiting service

      <t>As an identifier, the alert URN does not appear to raise any
      particular security issues. The indications described by the 'alert' URN
      are meant to be well-known, so privacy considerations do not apply to
      the URN.</t>

      <t>Provision of the specific indications from callee to caller may raise
      privacy issues. Such provision SHALL always be explicitly authorised by
