Abstract

   In most RTP-based multicast applications, the RTP source sends inter-
   related data.  Due to this interdependency, randomly joining RTP
   receivers usually cannot start consuming the multicast data right
   after they join the session.  Thus, they often experience a random
   acquisition delay.  One approach to reduce this delay is to use an
   auxiliary unicast RTP session with a retransmission server to receive
   a burst stream that facilitates rapid acquisition of the multicast
   stream.  An RTP receiver may use this approach (or any other
   approach) to achieve rapid acquisition.  Yet, due to various factors,
   performance of the rapid acquisition methods usually varies.
   Furthermore, in some cases the RTP receiver may (or may have to) do a
   simple multicast join.  For quality reporting, monitoring and
   diagnostics purposes, it is important to collect detailed information
   from the RTP receivers about their acquisition experiences.  This
   document addresses this issue by defining a new report block type,
   called Multicast Acquisition (MA) Report Block, within the framework
   of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XR).  This document
   also defines the necessary signaling of the new MA report block type
   in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).

Internet-Draft      MA Report Block Type for RTCP XR            May 2009


1.  Introduction

   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is the out-of-band control protocol for
   the applications that are using the Real-time Transport Protocol
   (RTP) for media transport [RFC3550].  In addition to providing
   minimal control functionality to RTP entities, RTCP also enables a
   basic level monitoring of RTP sessions via sender and receiver
   reports.  More statistically detailed monitoring as well as
   application-specific monitoring is usually achieved through the RTCP
   Extended Reports (XR) [RFC3611].

   In most RTP-based multicast applications such as the ones carrying
   video content, the RTP source sends inter-related data.
   Consequently, the RTP application may not be able to decode and
   present the data in an RTP packet before decoding one or more earlier
   RTP packets and/or before acquiring some Reference Information about
   the content itself.  Thus, RTP receivers that are randomly joining a
   multicast session often experience a random acquisition delay.  In
   order to reduce this delay, [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp]
   proposes an approach where an auxiliary unicast RTP session is
   established between a retransmission server and the joining RTP
   receiver.  Over this unicast RTP session, the retransmission server
   provides the Reference Information, which is all the information the
   RTP receiver needs to rapidly acquire the multicast stream.  However,
   depending on the variability in the Source Filtering Group Management
   Protocol (SFGMP) processing times, availability of network resources
   for rapid acquisition and nature of the RTP data, not all RTP
   receivers can acquire the multicast stream in the same amount of
   time.  The performance of rapid acquisition may vary not only for
   different RTP receivers but also over time.

   To increase the visibility of the multicast service provider into its
   network, to diagnose slow multicast acquisition issues and to collect
   the acquisition experiences of the RTP receivers, this document
   defines a new report block type, which is called Multicast
   Acquisition (MA) Report Block, within the framework of RTCP XR.  RTP
   receivers that are using the method described in
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] MAY use this report every
   time they join a new multicast RTP session.  RTP receivers that use a
   different method for rapid acquisition or those do not use any method
   but rather do a simple multicast join MAY also use this report.  This
   way, the multicast service provider can quantitatively compare the
   improvements achieved by different methods.

3.  Definitions

   This document uses the following acronyms and definitions from
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp]:

   Primary Multicast Session:  A multicast session which RTP receivers
   can join at a random point in time.

   Primary Multicast Stream:  The RTP stream to be acquired by the RTP
   receiver.

   Source Filtering Group Management Protocol (SFGMP):  Following the
   definition in [RFC4604], SFGMP refers to the Internet Group
   Management Protocol (IGMP) version 3 [RFC3376] and the Multicast
   Listener Discovery Protocol (MLD) version 2 [RFC3810] in the IPv4 and
   IPv6 networks, respectively.

   Retransmission Packet:  An RTP packet that is formatted as defined in
   [RFC4588].

   Reference Information:  The set of certain media content and metadata
   information that is sufficient for an RTP receiver to start usefully
   consuming a media stream.  The meaning, format and size of this
   information are specific to the application.

   (Unicast) Burst (Stream):  A unicast stream of RTP retransmission
   packets that enable an RTP receiver to rapidly acquire the Reference
   Information.  The burst stream is typically transmitted at an
   accelerated rate.

   Retransmission Server (RS):  The RTP/RTCP endpoint that can generate
   the retransmission packets and the burst stream.

4.  Multicast Acquisition (MA) Report Block

   This section defines the format of the MA report block.  The base
   report is payload-independent.  An extension mechanism is provided
   where further optional payload-independent and payload-specific
   information can be included in the report as desired.

   The optional extensions that are defined in this document are
   primarily developed for the method presented in
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp].  Other methods that provide
   rapid acquisition of multicast streams MAY define their own
   extensions to be used in the MA report block.

   The packet format for the RTCP XR is defined in Section 2 of
   [RFC3611].  Each XR packet has a fixed-length field for version,
   padding, reserved bits, payload type (PT), length, SSRC of packet
   sender as well as a variable-length field for report blocks.  In the
   XR packets, the PT field is set to XR (207).

4.1.  Base Report

   The base report format is shown in Figure 1.

   o  BT (8 bits):  Mandatory field that denotes the type for this block
      format.  The MA report block is identified by the constant TBD.

   o  Status (8 bits):  Mandatory field that denotes the status code.

      Editor's note:  Status codes will be defined and registered with
      IANA in a later version.  It is desirable to have status codes
      corresponding to the response codes that are proposed in Section
      7.2 of [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp].

   o  Block Length (16 bits):  The length of this report block,
      including the header, in 32-bit words minus one.

   o  SSRC of the Primary Multicast Stream (32 bits):  Mandatory field
      that denotes the SSRC of the primary multicast stream.

4.2.  Extensions

   To improve the reporting scope, it may be desirable to define new
   fields in the MA report block.  Such fields MUST be encoded as TLV
   elements as described below and sketched in Figure 2:

   o  Type:  A single-octet identifier that defines the type of the
      parameter represented in this TLV element.

   o  Length:  A two-octet field that indicates the length of the TLV
      element excluding the Type and Length fields in octets.  Note that
      this length does not include any padding that is required for
      alignment.

   o  Value:  Variable-size set of octets that contains the specific
      value for the parameter.

   If a TLV element does not fall on a 32-bit boundary, the last word
   MUST be padded to the boundary using further bits set to zero.

   In the MA report block, any vendor-neutral or private extension MUST
   be placed after the base report.  The support for extensions is
   OPTIONAL.

4.2.1.  Vendor-Neutral Extensions

   If the goal in defining new TLV elements is to extend the report
   block in a vendor-neutral manner, they MUST be registered with IANA
   through the guidelines provided in Section 7.3.

   The current document defines several vendor-neutral extensions.
   First, we present the TLV elements that can be used by any RTP-based
   multicast application.

   o  Extended RTP Seqnum of First Multicast Packet:  Optional TLV
      element that specifies the extended RTP sequence number of the
      first multicast packet received for the primary multicast stream.
      If no such packet has been received, this element SHALL NOT exist.

      Type:  TBD

      Length:  TBD

   o  SFGMP Join Time:  Optional TLV element that denotes the greater of
      zero or the time difference (in ms) between the instant SFGMP Join
      message has been sent and the instant the first RTP packet was
      received from the primary multicast session.  If no RTP packet has
      been received from the primary multicast session, this element
      SHALL NOT exist.

      Type:  TBD

      Length:  TBD

   o  Application Request-to-Multicast Delta Time:  Optional TLV element
      that denotes the time difference (in ms) between the instant the
      application became aware it would join a new multicast session and
      the instant the first RTP multicast packet was received for the
      primary multicast stream.  If no such packet has been received,
      this element SHALL NOT exist.

      Type:  TBD

      Length:  TBD

   o  Application Request-to-Presentation Delta Time:  Optional TLV
      element that denotes the time difference (in ms) between the
      instant the application became aware it would join a new multicast
      session and the instant the media is first presented.  If the RTP
      receiver cannot succesfully present the media, this element SHALL
      NOT exist.

      Type:  TBD

      Length:  TBD

   We next present the TLV elements that can be used when the RTP
   receiver supports and uses the method described in
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp].  However, if the RTP
   receiver does not send a rapid acquisition request, the following TLV
   elements MUST NOT exist in the MA report block.  Some elements may or
   may not exist depending on whether the RTP receiver receives any

   packet from the unicast and/or the primary multicast session or not.
   These are explained below.

   o  Application Request-to-RTCP Request Delta Time:  Optional TLV
      element that denotes the time difference (in ms) between the
      instant the application became aware it would request a rapid
      acquisition and the instant the rapid acquisition request was
      actually sent by the application.

      Type:  TBD

      Length:  TBD

   o  Request-to-Burst Delta Time:  Optional TLV element that denotes
      the time difference (in ms) between the instant the rapid
      acquisition request has been sent and the instant the first burst
      packet was received from the unicast session.  If no RTP packet
      has been received from the unicast session, this element SHALL NOT
      exist.

      Type:  TBD

      Length:  TBD

   o  Request-to-Multicast Delta Time:  Optional TLV element that
      denotes the time difference (in ms) between the instant the rapid
      acquisition request has been sent and the instant the first RTP
      multicast packet was received for the primary multicast stream.
      If no such packet has been received, this element SHALL NOT exist.

      Type:  TBD

      Length:  TBD

   o  Request-to-Burst-Completion Delta Time:  Optional TLV element that
      denotes the time difference (in ms) between the instant the rapid
      acquisition request has been sent and the instant the last burst
      packet was received from the unicast session.  If no RTP packet
      has been received from the unicast session, this element SHALL NOT
      exist.

      Type:  TBD

      Length:  TBD

   o  Number of Duplicate Packets:  Optional TLV element that denotes
      the number of duplicate packets due to receiving the same packet
      from both unicast and primary multicast sessions.  If no RTP

      multicast packet has been received for the primary multicast
      stream, this element SHALL NOT exist.  If no RTP packet has been
      received from the unicast session, the value of this element SHALL
      be set to zero.

      Type:  TBD

      Length:  TBD

   o  Size of Burst-to-Multicast Gap:  Optional TLV element that denotes
      the greater of zero or the difference between the sequence number
      of the first multicast packet (received for the primary multicast
      stream) and the sequence number of the last burst packet minus 1
      (considering the wrapping of the sequence numbers).  If no RTP
      packet has been received from the unicast session or no RTP
      multicast packet has been received for the primary multicast
      stream, this element SHALL NOT exist.

      Type:  TBD

      Length:  TBD

4.2.2.  Private Extensions

   It is desirable to allow vendors to use private extensions in TLV
   format.  For interoperability, such extensions MUST NOT collide with
   each other.

   A certain range of TLV Types is reserved for private extensions
   (Refer to Section 7.3).  IANA management for these extensions is
   unnecessary and they are the responsibility of individual vendors.

   The structure that MUST be used for the private extensions is
   depicted in Figure 3.  Here, the enterprise numbers are used from
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers.  This will ensure
   the uniqueness of the private extensions and avoid any collision.

5.  Session Description Protocol Signaling

   A new parameter is defined for the MA report block to be used with
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].  It has the following
   syntax within the 'rtcp-xr' attribute:

       rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=rtcp-xr:" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

            xr-format = "multicast-acq"

            CRLF      = %d13.10

                                 Figure 4

   Refer to Section 5.1 of [RFC3611] for a detailed description and the
   full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC3611] apply in this document as
   well.  If desired, similar to other RTCP XR reports, the MA reports
   MAY be protected by using SRTP and SRTCP [RFC3711].

   Using the MA reports to provide feedback into the acquisition of the
   multicast streams can introduce possible additional security
   implications.  If a forged or otherwise modified MA report is
   received for an earlier acquisition attempt, invalid data may be used
   as input in later rapid acquisition attempts.  For example,
   incorrectly small SFGMP join times may cause the unicast burst to be
   too short, leading to gaps in sequence numbers in the approach
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp].  Additionally,
   forged reports may give the appearance that rapid acquisition is
   performing correctly, when it is in fact failing, or vice versa.

   Further security considerations are TBD.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  RTCP XR Block Type

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

   This document (provisionally) assigns the block type value TBD in the
   RTCP XR Block Type Registry to "Multicast Acquisition Report Block."

7.2.  RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document registers the SDP [RFC4566] parameter 'multicast-acq'
   for the 'rtcp-xr' attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry.

   The contact information for the registrations is:

7.3.  Multicast Acquisition Report Block TLV Space Registry

   This document creates a new IANA TLV space registry for the MA report
   block extensions.  The registry is called the Multicast Acquisition
   Report Block TLV Space Registry.  This registry is to be managed by
   the IANA according to the Specification Required policy of [RFC5226].

   The length of the Type field in the TLV elements is a single octet,
   allowing 256 values.  The registry is initialized with the following
   entries:


   Type Description                                        Reference
   ---- -------------------------------------------------- -------------
   TBD  Extended RTP Seqnum of First Multicast Packet      This document
   ...  ...

   The registry entries are TBC.


   The TYPE values 0 and 255 are reserved for future use.  The TYPE
   values between (and including) 128 and 254 are reserved for private
   extensions.

   Any registration for an unassigned TYPE value MUST contain the
   following information:

   o  Contact information of the one doing the registration, including
      at least name, address, and email.

   o  A detailed description of what the new TLV element represents and
      how it shall be interpreted.
