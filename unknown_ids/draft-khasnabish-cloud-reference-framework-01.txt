           draft-khasnabish-cloud-reference-framework-01.txt

Abstract

   This document presents a cloud reference framework.  In general, a
   cloud based system utilizes virtualized resources and applications.
   The reference framework is based on the survey of the SDOs and WGs
   that are focusing on cloud-based systems and services (draft-
   Khasnabish-cloud-sdo-survey-01).  Both intra-cloud and inter-cloud
   reference frameworks are presented and the requirements of each layer
   are discussed.

Internet-Draft          Cloud Reference Framework              July 2011


1.  Introduction

   We develop a general cloud reference framework.  This reference
   framework describes basic functions in different layers to support
   the requirements of virtualized applications and services.  This
   reference framework can be used to standardize a) features of
   functional elements and b) the interfaces between the functions.

   Basically, the cloud reference framework includes

   o  Five horizontal layers

      *  Data/Content Layer(DCL)

      *  Application/Service Layer(ASL)

      *  Resource Control Layer(RCL)

      *  Resource Abstract and Virtualization Layer(RAVL)

      *  Physical Resource Layer(PRL)

   o  One stacked vertical layer to support

      *  Configuration management, registry, logging and auditing,
         security management, and service level agreement (SLA)
         management

3.1.  HORIZONTAL LAYERS

3.1.1.  Application/Service Layer

   Application/Service Layer defines the requirements of the basic
   functional entities based on the virtual resources needed to perform
   any tasks.  The tasks are classified according to the 3 services

   models IaaS, PaaS & SaaS.  Some cloud services are illustrated as an
   example of applications like:

   o  Server, desktop, database and VLAN for IaaS,

   o  Development environment and test environment for PaaS,

   o  Business, consumer, network and communication applications for
      SaaS.

   The requirements the basic functional entities provided include the
   following characteristics and parameters of the virtual resources:

   o  Type of resources: CPU, memory, hard disk space, bandwidth,
      latency, jitter, and so on

   o  Amount of resources

   o  Nature of the resources: dedicated vs. shared, transport media
      exclusions, and so on

   o  Timing of the resources: scheduled vs. on-demand

   o  Duration of the Resources

3.1.2.  Resources Control Layer

   Resources Control Layer manages the virtual resources, ensuring that
   the resources are efficient, secure and reliable.  With the interface
   of virtual resources, the layer integrates the resources as a whole
   supplied to upper layer.  The layer has the following
   responsibilities:

   o  Resource security management.  Resources must be accessed and
      owned by the right user, there are several function modules to
      fulfill this responsibility, include resource admission control,
      resource authentication and authorization control;

   o  Resource schedule control.  The layer manages resources in form of
      resource pool.  In a resource pool, the layer balances the virtual
      resources on a set of physical equipments to achieve higher
      hardware utilization.  Virtual resources can be migrated between
      physical equipments if necessary, and also can be allocated
      according to user's priority grade.

   o  Inter-cloud resource control.  Resources in a cloud can be shared
      with another cloud in some circumstances, so a cloud must control
      resources in other cloud, and supply cloud service to end users.

      End users have no need to know where the resources are from.

   o  Resource availability control.  The layer supports fault-tolerance
      on resources.  It can allocate another copy of resources as a
      backup, and switch over when some faults raised.

3.1.3.  Resources Abstraction and Virtualization Layer

   Physical resources at the lowest level are the most complex to share
   among multiple users.  There are several hardware details that don't
   need to visible to users, so we need a level of abstraction.  In
   fact, these physical resources are abstracted first.  The function of
   resources abstraction and virtualization layer is to convert physical
   resources to virtual resources.  Virtual resources are contained in
   resource pool.  Resources can be allocated to users from the resource
   pool, and released to resource pool when it's not needed.

   Virtual resources are isolated from physical equipments, and have the
   features:

   o  Have all features as physical resources, resource users can't
      distinguish the difference between them;

   o  Can be allocated and released on demand;

   o  Support heterogeneous physical equipments, and supply a
      consistency view of resources to users;

   o  Support resource mobility, virtual resource can move from a
      physical equipment to another seamlessly;

   There are several types of resources, such as computing resource,
   storage resource, database, bandwidth and network.  According to the
   type of resource, there are different methods to realize
   virtualization.  The variety function modules for virtualization are
   contained in Resources abstraction and virtualization layer.  The
   layer has the following responsibilities:

   o  Through the interface of physical equipment to manage physical
      resource, mapping the virtual resources to physical resource;

   o  Supply the interface to upper layer to manage and access virtual
      resources;

   o  Hide the details of physical equipments, mask the difference
      between physical equipments.

   o  Automatically deploying the cloud system based on the
      configuration data and policy

   o  Real-time monitoring and alerting of cloud status, resource usage
      and performance of cloud

   o  Reporting and charting of historical events and performance
      metrics

   o  Flexible IT management and operational status displays

   o  Authenticating/Authorizing the published cloud service registry

   o  Auditing the cloud environment to check whether its running
      smoothly

   o  Controlling the SLA implemented in the cloud system

   o  Maintenance concerned with performing repairs, upgrades and new
      nodes join into the Cloud

   o  Providing Security mechanism for the Cloud

   Basically CML includes four Functions:

   o  Cloud Configuration Management

   o  Cloud Service Registry and Audit Management

   o  Cloud SLA Management

   o  Cloud Service Security Management

3.2.1.1.  Cloud Configuration Management

   Cloud Configuration Management (CCM) is responsible for establishing
   and maintaining the consistent performance of the Clouds system or
   product and its functional and physical attributes throughout its
   life-cycle.  It mainly focuses on configuring the cloud system and
   retrieving the configuration information automatically.  Requirements
   on Configuration Management are as follows:

   o  Provide efficient and reliable means to provision large amounts of
      configuration data.  Current versions of provision configuration
      data are CLI, SNMP and NETCONF.

   o  Provide secure means to provision configuration data.  The system
      must provide support for access control, authentication,

      integrity-checking, replay- protection and/or privacy security
      services.

   o  Provide means to send feedback information to the management
      system.  Feedback information include configuration data
      confirmation, network status and monitoring information, specific
      events, etc.

   o  Provide expiration time and effective time capabilities to
      configuration data.  It is required that some configuration data
      items be set to expire, and other items be set to never expire.

   o  Provide facilities to help in tracing back configuration changes

   o  Be flexible and extensible to accommodate future needs.
      Configuration management data models are not fixed for all time
      and are subject to evolution like any other management data model.

   o  Leverage knowledge of the existing SNMP management infrastructure,
      such as the knowledge of and experience with MIBs and SMI.

   o  Basically, the CM includes CM database, CM policy, system change
      management and version management.

   o  Related protocol: CLI, SNMP, NETCONF

3.2.1.2.  Cloud Service Registry/Repository

   Service Registry/Repository provides management and governance
   capabilities that enable the published cloud service to be
   authenticated in the cloud system and accessed by service client.  It
   facilitates storing, accessing and managing service information,
   called service metadata, so that the cloud service can be easily
   published, selected, invoked, enriched, governed and reused.

   Requirements on Service Registry/Repository are as follows:

   o  Authentication & Authorization.  Once a service is published by
      the service provider to the Cloud system, it should be
      authenticated to check the authority of the provider and the
      support capability of the Cloud.  If the check is passed, the
      service is authorized and put into the repository, and the
      services and related metadata are classified into groups.

   o  Publication & Discovery.  The authorized service is published in
      the Cloud system, and you can keep an accurate record of the
      deployed services in your repository platform.  The user can find
      the service from the repository platform using the service

      discovery engine.  Cloud Service Registry/Repository is capable of
      a powerful query mechanism allows you to search and find the
      services that best fit the requirements of a given process.

   o  Service Access Control.  The service repository enables dynamic
      and efficient access to services information by enabling selection
      of services based on service metadata.

   o  Optimize service usage.  Service manage capability enables
      management of service metadata, as well as service interactions,
      dependencies and redundancies.  You can classify services based on
      business objectives, manage policies for service usage and monitor
      how services are changed and versioned.  This capability helps you
      optimize the use of services in cloud system by exchanging service
      metadata with runtime monitoring tools and operational data
      stores.

   o  Impact analysis.  By maintaining relationships, Cloud Service
      Registry/Repository has extensive support for analyzing the impact
      of service introduction, deletion or alteration.

   o  Service life cycle.  By creating user-definable entities and
      customizing the service life cycle, you can configure Cloud
      Service Registry/Repository precisely according to your business
      needs.  You can easily implement best practices for service life-
      cycle management with the ability to promote services and life-
      cycle validations.

   o  Policy support.  You can publish policies that apply to services
      stored in Cloud Service Registry/Repository.  These policies help
      you institute best practices in your Cloud deployment.

   o  Governance profile.  To help you get started easily and quickly,
      Cloud Service Registry/Repository provides a welldefined service
      model that includes templates, associated life cycles, governance
      policies, a classification system, roles and perspectives.

3.2.1.3.  Cloud Audit Management

   Cloud Audit Management (CAM) is to provide an agent through which
   cloud providers and authorized consumers automate the Audit,
   Assertion, Assessment, and Assurance of the cloud infrastructure
   (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and application (SaaS) environments to
   reduce the risk.  A common interface and namespace can be used by the
   CAM to facilitate these audit functions.

   Requirements on CAM are as follows:




Khasnabish, et al.       Expires January 2, 2012               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          Cloud Reference Framework              July 2011


   o  A well-defined objective and scope tied to quality compliance and
      risk management processes

   o  Establish clear policies, procedures, and metrics.  Audit
      management should incorporate defined policies, procedures, and
      metrics as performance benchmarks.  These elements should be
      reviewed periodically for continuous improvement.

   o  Integrate essential quality management processes.  An effective
      audit management system should automate the entire audit process
      and include integration of the following processes:

      *  Corrective and preventive actions

      *  Change control

      *  Non-conformance tracking and management

      *  Regulatory document/content management

      *  Custom reporting, analysis and analytics

      *  Training

      *  Compliance intelligence dashboard

3.2.1.4.  Cloud SLA Management (CSM)

   SLA is a part of a service contract where the level of service is
   formally defined between Cloud service providers and Cloud customers.
   Within the terms of their contracts, the SLA will have a technical
   definition, typical terms as MTTF (Mean Time To Failures), MTTR (Mean
   Time To Repair), ABA (Abandonment Rate), ASA (Average Speed to
   Answer), TSF (Time Service Factor), FCR (First Call Resolution), TAT
   (Turn Around Time), Uptime Agreements, various data rates, etc.

   SM is to control the usage and receipt of resources from and by third
   parties.  The strategy of CSM includes the negotiation of the
   contract and the monitoring of its realization in real-time.  Thus,
   CSM encompasses the SLA contract definition (basic schema within QoS
   parameters), the SLA negotiation, the SLA monitoring, and the SLA
   enforcement.

   SM also need define rate reductions and discounts that are applied
   when a service provider fails to meet the desired service parameters
   or does not fulfill an agreement.

   Requirements on CSM are as follows:



Khasnabish, et al.       Expires January 2, 2012               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          Cloud Reference Framework              July 2011


   o  SLA template specification. when service provider publishes a new
      service, an SLA template which describes the contract type that
      goes with the resource usage will be specified.  Such a template
      may be hard to define we propose to develop a skeleton of a
      template with the corresponding write-up procedure.

   o  Negotiation.  Service client and service providers have to agree
      on the terms of the SLA binding them and also with the
      consequences to violations.

   o  Resource Optimization.  When the SLA processes the service access
      request from the service client, it also has to keep in mind the
      optimization of the usage of resources, and the QoS guaranteed in
      the SLA.

   o  Monitoring.  Once the cloud system has started providing access to
      its resources, it should monitor the operating resources.  The
      monitored information is then used to prove the QoS agreed within
      the SLA being satisfied.

   o  Re-negotiation.  Some party of the contract may wish to change the
      resource usage policy while the system is running, in order to
      comply with a change in external conditions.  In order to keep the
      behaviour of the process continuous, the agreed SLA need adjust to
      assure the process vitality after migration and resource shortage.

   o  Evaluation.  Besides the running information is interested by the
      managers and users, other data like contract violations or global
      statistics are also needed in order to verify the SLA.  Evaluation
      is the process of analyzing the previously monitored information.
      An evaluation daemon may be proposed, based on the monitoring
      tools developed.

   o  Accounting.  The use of a resource generates an accounting sheet
      which describes the resources used and aligns them with the
      billing rules agreed in the SLA.  This is a base to draft the real
      financial exchange, which can be in disfavour of the provider in
      case of failure to comply with the compromised QoS.  This subject
      is very sensible, and the development of tools for such themes
      should not be taken lightly.

3.2.1.5.  Cloud Service Security Management

   Cloud Service Security (CSS) provides a set of mechanisms (e.g.  IP
   address filtering, message integrity & confidentiality, private key
   encryption, dynamic session key encryption, user authentication and



Khasnabish, et al.       Expires January 2, 2012               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft          Cloud Reference Framework              July 2011


   Service certification) to protect Cloud Services and their operating
   environment from damage.

   Requirements on CSS are as follows

   o  Licensing.  It is likely that your service is made up of many
      different components, most of which have some type of licensing
      agreement associated with them.  You will need to review each of
      those agreements to determine if, or how, those licenses will be
      affected by deployment in a cloud.  If your service uses a
      component that is licensed by CPU and you deploy it in a cloud
      environment designed to launch new instances and request more
      resources as load increases, for example, you could easily exceed
      your CPU license limit.  You will need to understand how your
      licenses affect your ability to scale.

   o  Processing requirements and memory locks.  If dynamic scalability
      is your main reason for looking to the cloud, then your
      application should be designed to take advantage of a parallel
      architecture.  If the application is designed with multi-threaded
      code that allows processing to be split into small chunks, it's
      well-suited for use within the cloud.  An application that is
      designed around single monolithic thread processing, on the other
      hand, will find it difficult to take advantage of the cloud's
      distributed nature.

   o  Communication protocol.  The cloud is based on the Internet
      Protocol (IP), so for an service to be considered, it must use IP
      as its communication mechanism.  While there are many protocols
      that can be run over IP, the IP layer can provide security
      mechanism to protect the security of the transmitted data.

   o  Data security.  The service needs to provide security at the data
      storage, processing and transmission stages.  Data at rest must be
      protected by the service, that is the service must provide a
      mechanism to protect the data stored in the cloud.  Data in
      transit needs to be protected either at the service or the
      transmission level.  Most services choose the transmission level
      for protection and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer
      Security (TLS) protocols are often used.  Server to server
      communications need to ensure the security from one cloud instance
      to another cloud instance.

4.  Inter-Cloud Framework

   A Cloud Service Provider (CSP) can offer services using one or more
   date centers (DCs).  These DCs can provide virtualized compute,
   storage, and networking resources on on-demand basis to the Cloud
   Service Consumers (CSC).  Therefore, the DC infrastructure does not
   necessarily need to be a static entity as in a traditional DC.  The
   infrastructure resources can span multiple CSPs and the entity that
   is offered to the consumer can be referred to as the Infrastructure
   as a Service (IaaS).

   With the IaaS, a CSC can acquire and release resources on on-demand
   basis.

   We therefore define an Inter-Cloud as a interconnction of clouds
   where two or more cloud service providers (any combination of
   Service-Provider-owned, private, public, etc.) can collaborate.  The
   objective of the collaboration is to dynamically distribute the
   workloads based on mutually agreed upon service level agreement
   (SLA).

4.1.  Inter-Cloud Requirements

   Inter-cloud requirements may be articulated as follows:

   o  Provide a mechanism for resource search and discovery, to
      determine which serving cloud might have certain resources
      available (including a match making mechanism).

   o  Provide a mechanism to authenticate participating entities.

   o  Provide a mechanism for requesting, controlling, and releasing
      resources between two clouds.

   o  Provide a secure transport channel between the interconnecting
      entities.

   o  Provide end-to-end isolation to support multitenancy.

   o  Provide a mechanism for monitoring, assuring, and troubleshooting
      across the interconnection.

   o  Provide a mechanism for defining the monitoring metrics such as
      Delay-Jitter-Loss.  This may be useful for monitoring a flow such
      as TCP/UDP between IP prefix and a destination address across the
      interconnection.

   Execution Node is a physical or virtual machines on which target
   telecomm functions (software) are running.  For example, in IMS, CSCF
   and HSS are candidates of functions.

   Information Server (optional) is used for discovery and assignment of
   Execution Node for a session (e.g., P-CSCF at a UE's registration).
