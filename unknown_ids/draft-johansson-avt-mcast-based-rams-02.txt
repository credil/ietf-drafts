      Extended Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions (ERAMS)
                draft-johansson-avt-mcast-based-rams-02

Abstract

   This document proposes Extended RAMS (ERAMS), which is a complement
   to the unicast based Rapid Acquisition for Multicast based Streaming
   (RAMS) discussed in [ID-RAMS].  The outline of this added
   functionality to RAMS is to gather up Rapid Acquisition requests for
   many users and transmit them in dedicated multicast streams.  With
   this technique the peak load on the retransmission server and on the
   outgoing link from the retransmission server can be reduced.  For a
   problem description of the channel change problem in multicast based
   IPTV the reader is encouraged to read [ID-RAMS].

1.  Definitions

   This document uses the following acronyms and definitions frequently:

      RR: Retransmission Receiver

      RS: Retransmission Server

      TLV: Type Length Value (field)

      STB: Set Top Box

   More acronyms are defined in [ID-RAMS].


2.  Introduction

   Draft [ID-RAMS] proposes a method for fast channel change in
   multicast RTP session that employs setting up separate unicast burst
   transmissions to set top boxes that changes channel.

   The methods should considerably reduce the channel switch latency as
   experienced by the end user.

   There are a number of potential issues with the aforementioned
   methods.

   o  Peaky load pattern: Viewers of popular IPTV channels may display a
      synchronized behavior in their channel change pattern , for
      instance when a commercial break sets in or a popular TV show
      ends.

   o  High load on the retransmission server: The retransmission server
      will sometimes be exposed to high load, also the load on the
      outgoing link from the retransmission server can be very high.
      This means that the retransmission server and the outgoing link
      typically needs to be over provisioned, something that may be
      costly for the implementer of the IPTV infrastructure.

   This draft explains how multiple rapid acquisition requests can be
   gathered up and served via a dedicated multicast channel and can be
   used as an improvement to the method described in [ID-RAMS].  The
   additional delay compared to a solely unicast based version depends
   on the gather up time which can be set quite low during low load
   conditions and set to higher values during high load conditions
   (giving graceful degradation).  The benefit is that the peak load on
   the retransmission server is reduced considerably.  Another method
   that is described is to setup multicast control channels that

Internet-Draft                Extended RAMS                   March 2010


   contains information about rapid acquisition multicast feeds that are
   active.

   Section 5 in [ID-RAMS] states "Rapid acquisition is an optimization
   of a system that must continue to work correctly whether or not the
   optimization is effective, or even fails due to lost control
   messages, congestion, or other problems".  The method described in
   this draft promises to ensure that resource usage is optimized and
   thus helps to avoid e.g congestion.

   Furthermore section 6.4 [ID-RAMS] says "However, a higher rate for
   the burst also increases the chances for congestion-caused packet
   loss.  Thus, as discussed in Section 5, there must be an upper bound
   on the extra bandwidth used by the burst".  The method described in
   this draft minimizes the load on the RS as well as the outgoing link
   from it.


3.  Description

   The proposed solution can serve as a complement to the solutions
   outlined in [ID-RAMS].  During low load conditions the retransmission
   server (RS) will serve each RAMS-R request from an RR in an STB (set-
   top box) with an individual unicast RTP burst as described in
   [ID-RAMS].  As the load increases the RS will gather up RAMS-R for
   the same channels over a defined time window (Td) and set up a
   multicast stream that contains the same contents as the unicast
   stream would have done.  The time window that is used to gather up
   RAMS-R requests for the same channel is made dependent on the load on
   the RS.  During fairly low load conditions the time window is made
   small (e.g Td=50ms), as load gets higher the time window increases,
   thus the degradation in channel switching performance will become
   graceful.

   RR-1 transmits a RAMS-R to RS, requesting rapid acquisition data for
   channel A, as RR-1 is the first to request this data, a timer is
   started in order to wait for a given time span (Td) for other RAMS-R
   for the same channel from other RR's.  RS sends a RAMS-I to RR-1 with
   instructions to listen in on a specified multicast address (X) and
   thus RS-1 makes an SFGMP Join to said multicast address.

   The response code in RAMS-I when ERAMS is used is a 3xx response code
   [Number TBD].

   Later RR-2 sends a RAMS-R to RS, requesting rapid acquisition data
   for channel A. RS sends a RAMS-I to RR-2 with instructions to listen
   in on X (as defined above) and RS-2 also makes an SFGMP Join to the
   said multicast address

   When the timer (Td) is expired, RS will stream the requested data on
   multicast channel X. The data speed in the multicast channel is
   preferably higher than normal playout speed (e.g 120%).

   When sufficient data has been received via the multicast channel X,
   both RR-1 and RR-2 makes an SFGMP Join to multicast channel A.

   As Td is made dependent on the load on the RS this method allows for
   graceful degradation.  A special case occurs when the timer expires
   and only one RR has sent a request, this case is similar to the
   unicast streaming case already specified in [ID-RAMS].

   At severe load conditions the RAMS-R requests will be either ignored
   or responded with a negative acknowledgement (error code 501), in
   which case the RR's will not receive any rapid acquisition data.

   There are a few different ways to determine when a switch from the
   rapid acquisition channel to the normal multicast channel should be
   made:

   1.  A multicast control channel tells the RR that it is time to
       switch or can give the RR sufficient information necessary to
       make the switch

   2.  The RS informs the RR about the synchronization point in a RAMS-I
       message.

   3.  A marker in the rapid acquisition media stream tells the RR to
       make a switch

   4.  Count of frames, the RR can itself decide to switch after
       receiving e.g 3 I-frames.  In this case the RR must know the size
       of the RS buffer to avoid a gap in the stream.  This information
       can be provided for in the RAMS-I message.

   In certain cases it is preferable (for instance limited downlink
   bandwidth) that the rapid acquisition stream to a particular RR is
   terminated (e.g by means of SFGMP Leave) before the normal multicast
   channel is joined.  Depending on how the decision to switch is made
   there is a slight possibility that data will be missing, to alleviate

   this risk the normal multicast streams can be delayed a fraction of a
   second to allow for a certain switching time and a smooth transition
   from the rapid acquisition data to the normal multicast channel.
   Extended RAMS here has the benefit that the join and leave messages
   can be sent simultaneously or almost simultaneously and to the same
   endpoint.  This reduces the risk of having parallel streams over the
   last mile interface with lower risk of congestion as a result.

   The new TLV field is included in a RAMS-R when the RR supports
   Extended RAMS and prefers to use the mechanism.  The field contains a
   few flags that can be combined. [ Ed. note it is not certain that
   these flags are really needed, it may be sufficient to signal this in
   the session setup instead].

   setup information instead].

   The RAMS-I message MUST use the response code 3xx [number TBD]

   An RR SHOULD use this TLV field in the RAMS-T if this TLV was
   included in a RAMS-I.  The values of the TLV field should be the same
   as in the RAMS-I.  This may help the RS to determine when to
   terminate the ERAMS flow completely.

3.3.  Considerations

3.3.1.  Different max Bitrates

   It is possible that the RR that sends RAMS-R for a given channel also
   indicate different Max Receive Bitrate in their requests.  A
   retransmission server that serves the RAMS-R has to adapt its
   transmission rate to the RAMS-R request with the lowest indicated Max
   Receive Bitrate.  An option is to collect the RAMS-R in two or more
   groups, each group can then provide with different transmission
   bitrates.

3.3.2.  Reaction to Packet Loss

   Packet losses may occur in the ERAMS transmission.  In normal cases
   an RR that detects packet losses can request retransmission from the
   retransmission server.  However, as ERAMS is to be used in conditions
   where the load on the RS is high it is NOT RECOMMENDED to request
   retransmission as the chance that this retransmission request can be
   served is anyway minimal.  If the packet loss is severe the RR MAY
   also to send a RAMS-T prematurely.  This may be helpful in resolving
   congestion situations.

3.3.3.  RTP/RTCP Port Multiplexing

   A system that supports ERAMS SHOULD implement and use RTP/RTCP port
   multiplexing, this simplifies setup of ERAMS considerably as the
   number of multicast flows that are setup is half of that compared to
   the case when RTP/RTCP port multiplexing is not used.

3.4.  Alternative Solutions

   Besides the methodology described above, another possibility is also
   that an RR joins a multicast control channel which contains
   information about which multicast channel contains rapid acquisition
   data for a given channel.  Because of the limited amount of data that
   is carried in this multicast control channel reliable transmission
   techniques can possibly be used.
