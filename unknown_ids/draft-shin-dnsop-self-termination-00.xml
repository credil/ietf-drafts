      <t>
	  Anycast has in recent years become popular for DNS servers and widely 
       applied to several root nams servers and to other commercial name 
       servers.  For Anycast-based DNS service reliability, this documents 
       describes the use of self-termination mechanism in Anycast-based DNS 
       service operation when the service becomes unavailable due to events 
       such as hardware failures
	  </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	     DNS service is one of the most important factors in Internet 
       infrastructures.  Anycast-based[1] DNS service [2] has been discussed 
       within related areas for providing stable service to the users for 
       many years. 
	    </t>

      <t>
       Anycast-based DNS service has generally various advantages such as 
       effective dealing with DDoS attack, overcoming the limit of 
       authoritative name server's physical numbers and improving service 
       stability and performance through a distribution of DNS traffic. More 
       good points are described in other related documents.  
      </t>

      <t>
      For that reason, the number of DNS nodes (e.g., Root DNS, TLD DNS and 
      sub-level authoritative DNS) which ancyast-based DNS architecture 
      applied has been increased greatly.  
      </t>

      <t>
       In spite of these merits, one of the problems is that Anycast DNS 
       service system would keep advertising of its normal condition even 
       when it becomes unavailable.  Particularly, Anycast DNS service with 
       no self-monitoring system may not be able to respond to queries 
       regionally for some time. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
       In order to solve this problem, this documents describes self-
       termination mechanism of interfaces on hosts making queries go out to 
       other mirror sites automatically.  
      </t>
    </section>

     <section title="Self-termination Mechanism">
     <t>
       As the DNS Server has a trouble in responding to queries, it can be 
       self-monitored by using a simple script like the following.  This 
       script monitors the behavior of the DNS for 5 times and continuously 
       alerts the DNS Administrator.
     </t>
     
     <t>
       The Self-termination process by using OSPF Link State 
       Advertisements(LSAs), The DNS server itself could be Self-terminated 
       by simply setting down network interfaces(e.g lo0).
     </t>
     
     <t>
       Then queries from the Anycast DNS would be bypassed to the shortest 
       alternate Anycast DNS and the DNS Service would be reliable.
