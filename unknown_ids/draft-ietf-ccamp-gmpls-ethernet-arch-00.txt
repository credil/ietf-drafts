Abstract

   There has been significant recent work in increasing the capabilities
   of Ethernet switches. As a consequence, the role of Ethernet is
   rapidly expanding into "transport networks" that previously were the
   domain of other technologies such as SONET/SDH TDM and ATM. This
   document defines an architecture and framework for a GMPLS based
   control plane for Ethernet in this "transport network" capacity.
   GMPLS has already been specified for similar technologies. Some
   additional extensions to the GMPLS control plane are needed and this
   document provides a framework for these extensions.

Document History

   This is the initial draft of this document.


1. Introduction

   There has been significant recent work in increasing the capabilities
   of Ethernet switches. As a consequence, the role of Ethernet is
   rapidly expanding into "transport networks" that previously were the
   domain of other technologies such as SONET/SDH TDM and ATM.  The
   evolution and development of Ethernet capabilities in these areas is
   a very active and ongoing process.

   Multiple organizations have been active in extending Ethernet
   technology.  This activity has taken place in the IEEE 802.1 Working
   Group, the ITU and the MEF.  These groups have been focusing on
   Ethernet forwarding, Ethernet management plane extensions and the
   Ethernet Spanning Tree Control Plane, but not an explicitly routed,
   constraint based control plane.

   In the forwarding plane context, extensions have been, or are being,
   defined to support different Ethernet forwarding models, protection
   modes and service interfaces.  Examples of such extensions include
   [802.1ah], [802.1Qay], [G.8011] and [MEF.6]. The provider extensions
   allow for greater flexibility in the forwarding plane. In the
   802.1Qay case the extensions allow for a departure from forwarding
   based on Ethernet spanning tree.  The greater flexibility in
   forwarding is achieved through the addition of a "provider" address
   space.

   This document is a framework for GMPLS Ethernet Label switching
   (GELS). It will be followed by technology specific documents. GELS
   will require more than one switching type, and the GMPLS procedures
   that will need to be changed is dependent on switching, and thus will
   be covered in the technology specific documents.

   In the new provider bridge model developed in the IEEE802.1ad-project
   and amended to the IEEE802.1Q standard [802.1Q], an extra VLAN
   identifier (VID) is added. This VLAN is referred to as the Service
   VID, (S-VID and is carried in a Service TAG (S-TAG). In provider
   backbone bridges (PBB) [802.1ah] a backbone VID (B-VID) and B-MAC

   header with a Service Instance (I-TAG) encapsulates a customer
   Ethernet frame or a service Ethernet frame. An example of Ethernet
   protection extensions can be found in [G.8031]. In the IEEE802.1Q
   standard the terms Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB) and Provider
   Backbone Bridged Network (PBBN) is used in the context of these
   extensions.

   Ethernet operations, administration, and maintenance (OAM) is another
   important area that is being extended to enable provider Ethernet
   services.  Related extensions can be found in [802.1ag] and [Y.1731].

   The Ethernet forwarding and management plane extensions explicitly
   allow for the disabling of standard Ethernet spanning tree but do not
   define an explicitly routed, constraint based control plane.  The
   IEEE802.1, in [802.1Qay], works on an new amendment that explicitly
   allows for traffic engineering of Ethernet forwarding paths.

   The IETF chartered the GMPLS work to specify a common control plane
   for physical path and core tunneling technologies for the Internet
   and telecommunication service providers. The GMPLS architecture is
   specified in RFC3945 [RFC3945]. The protocols specified for GMPLS
   have been used to control "Transport Networks", e.g. Optical and TDM
   networks.

   This document provides a framework for use of GMPLS to control
   "transport" Ethernet. The GMPLS architecture already handles a number
   of transport technologies but Ethernet adds a few new constraints
   that must be documented. Some additional extensions to the GMPLS
   control plane are needed and this document provides a framework for
   these extensions.  All extensions to support Eth-LSPs are also
   expected to build on the GMPLS Architecture and related
   specifications.

   This document introduces and explains the concept of an Ethernet
   Label Switched Path (Eth-LSP). The data plane aspects of Eth-LSPs are
   outside the scope of this document and IETF activities.

   The intent of this document is to reuse and align with as much of the
   GMPLS protocols as possible.  For example reusing the IP control
   plane addressing allows the existing signaling, routing, LMP and path
   computation to be used as specified. Additions are made only to
   accommodate features of Ethernet that are not already supported by
   GMPLS.  The GMPLS protocols support a set of tools for hierarchical
   LSPs as well as contiguous LSPs. GMPLS specific protocol mechanisms
   support a variety of networks from peer to peer to UNIs and NNIs.

2. Background

   This section provides background to the types of switching and
   services that are supported within the defined framework.  The former
   is particularly important as it identifies the switching functions
   that GMPLS will need to represent and control. The intent is for this
   document to allow for all standard forms of Ethernet switching and
   services.

   The material presented in this section is based on the on-going work
   taking place in the IEEE 802.1 Working Group, the ITU and the MEF.
   This section references and, to some degree, summarizes that work.
   This section is not a replacement for, or an authoritative
   description of that work.


2.1. Ethernet Switching

   In Ethernet switching terminology, the bridge relay is responsible
   for forwarding and replicating the frames.  Bridge relays forward
   frames based on the header fields: Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)
   Identifiers (VID) and Destination Media Access Control (DMAC)
   address. PBB [802.1ah] has also introduced a Service Instance tag (I-
   TAG).  Across all the Ethernet extensions (already referenced in the
   Introduction), multiple forwarding functions, or service interfaces,
   have been defined using the combination of VIDs, DMACs, and I-TAGs.
   PBB [802.1ah] provides a breakdown of the different types of Ethernet
   switching services. Figure 1 reproduces this breakdown.

                Figure 1: Ethernet Switching Service Types

   The types are defined in Clause 25 of [802.1ah], and are consistent
   with the definitions of Ethernet services supported in [G.8011] and
   [MEF.6].  To summarize the definitions:

   o Port based
     This is a frame based service that supports specific frame types,
     no Service VLAN tagging, with MAC address based switching.

   o S-tagged
     There are multiple Service VLAN tag (S-tag) aware services,
     including:

     + one-to-one
       In this service, each VLAN identifier (VID) is mapped into a
       different service.

     + Bundled
       Bundled S-tagged service supports the mapping of multiple VIDs
       into a single service and include:

       * many-to-one
         In this frame based service, multiple VIDs are mapped into the
         same service.

       * all-to-one
         In this frame based service, all VIDs are mapped into the same
         service.

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-ethernet-arch-00.txt    Feb 6, 2008


         - transparent
           This is a special case, all frames are mapped from a single
           incoming port to a single destination Ethernet port.

   o I-tagged
     The edge of a PBBN consists of a combined backbone relay (B-
     component relay) and service instance relay (I-component relay).
     An I-Tag contains a service identifier (24 bit I-SID) and priority
     markings as well as some other flags.  An I-Tagged service is
     typically between the edges of the PBBN and terminated at each edge
     on an I-component that faces a customer port so the service is
     often not visible except at the edges.  However since the I-
     component relay involves a distinct relay it is possible to have a
     visible I-Tagged Service by separating the I component relay from
     the B-component relay.  Two examples where it makes sense to do
     this are: an I-Tagged service between two PBBNs and as an
     attachment to a customer's Provider Instance Port.


   In general, the different types determine which of the Ethernet
   header fields are used in the forwarding/switching function, e.g. VID
   only or VID and DMACs.  The types may also require the use of
   additional Ethernet headers or fields. Services defined for UNIs tend
   to use the headers on a hop-by-hop basis.

   In most cases for bridging, the header fields cannot be changed hop-
   by-hop, but some translations of VID field values are permitted
   typically at the edges. Again, while not specifically described in
   802.1ah, the Ethernet services being defined in the context of
   [MEF.6] and [G.8011] also fall into the types defined in Figure 1.

   Across all service types, the Ethernet data plane is bi-directional
   congruent. This means that the forward and reverse paths share the
   exact same set of nodes, ports and bi-directional links.  This
   property is fundamental. The 802.1 group has defined maintained this
   bi-directional congruent property in the definition of Connectivity
   Fault Management (CFM) which is part of the overall Operations
   Administration and Management (OAM) capability.


2.2. Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)

   Robustness is enhanced with the addition of data plane OAM to provide
   both fault and performance management.

   For the Eth LSP unicast mode of behavior, the hardware performs
   unicast packet forwarding of known MAC addresses exactly as Ethernet
   currently operates. The OAM currently defined, [802.1ag] and [Y.1731]



Fedyk, et. al.                Informational                     [Page 7]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-ethernet-arch-00.txt    Feb 6, 2008


   can also be reused without modification of the protocols.

   OAM relies on domain wide path identifiers, for data plane
   forwarding, utilizing the 60 bit unique connection ID (VID/DMAC).
   Determining a broken path or misdirected packet in this case relies
   on the connection ID not being altered on the Eth-LSP. These
   identifiers are independent of the control plane so it works equally
   well for provisioned or GMPLS controlled paths.

   Ethernet OAM currently consists of:
   Defined in both [802.1ag & Y.1731]:
   - CCM/RDI: Connectivity Check, Remote Defect Indication
   - LBM/LBR: Loopback Message, Loopback Reply
   - LTM/LTR: Link trace Message, Link trace Reply
   - VSM/VSR: Vendor-specific extensions Message/Reply

   Additionally defined in [Y.1731]:
   - AIS:        Alarm Indication Signal
   - LCK:        Locked Signal
   - TST:        Test
   - LMM/LMR:    Loss Measurement Message/Reply
   - DM/DMM/DMR: Delay Measurement
   - EXM/EXR:    Experimental
   - APS, MCC:   Automatic Protection Switching, Maintenance
                 Communication Channel
   - Placeholders for ITU other standards

   With some Eth-LSP label formats bidirectional transactions (e.g.
   LBM/LBR) and reverse direction transactions MAY have a different VID
   for each direction. Currently Y.1731 & 802.1ag makes no
   representations with respect to this but work us underway to address
   this in PBB-TE [802.1Qay].


2.3. Terminology

2.3.1. Concepts

   The following are basic Ethernet and GMPLS terms:

     o Asymmetric Bandwidth

       This term refers to the property of a Bi-directional LSP may have
       differing bandwidth allocation in each direction.







Fedyk, et. al.                Informational                     [Page 8]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-ethernet-arch-00.txt    Feb 6, 2008


     o Bi-directional Congruent LSP

       This term refers to the property that an LSP shared the same
       nodes, ports and links. Ethernet data planes are normally bi-
       directional congruent.

     o Shared forwarding

       Shared forwarding is a property of a data path where a single
       forwarding entry (VID + DMAC) may be used for frames from
       multiple sources (SMAC). Shared forwarding does not change any
       data plane behavior it saves forwarding information base (FIB)
       entries only. From all other aspects it behaves as if there were
       multiple FIB entries.

     o In-band GMPLS Signaling

       In-band GMPLS Signaling is IP based signaling on the native
       Ethernet links encapsulated by a single hop Ethernet header.
       Logical links that use a dedicated VID on the same physical links
       would be considered In-band signaling.

     o Out-of-band GMPLS Signaling is IP based signaling between
       Ethernet switches that uses some other links other than the
       Ethernet data plane links. Out of band signaling typically shares
       a different fate from the data links.

     o Contiguous Eth-LSP is an Eth-LSP that maps one to one with and
       LSP at a domain boundary. Stitched LSP are contiguous LSPs.

     o Hierarchical Eth-LSPs are Eth-LSPs that are encapsulated and
       tunneled either individually or bundled with other LSPs through a
       domain.

2.4. Ethernet and MPLS similarities and differences

   Ethernet is similar to MPLS in that there is a default payload type.
   In MPLS the default payload is either another MPLS label or an IP
   packet. The IP packet may carry any type of service IP carries.
   Ethernet assumes an Ethernet frame as the default payload. The actual
   service can be anything that Ethernet carries.

   In MPLS pseudo wires where other types of payloads are used natively
   the payload may be identified implicitly or explicitly by using a
   control word removing the need for the IP header.

   Similarly, in Ethernet the option to carry other payloads by using
   either implicit or explicit means is being discussed.

   Ethernet bridging is different from MPLS in that while the switching
   decision is taken on whatever is defined as the Ethernet label, that
   label is usually not swapped at each hop.


3. Framework

   As defined in the (GMPLS) Architecture [RFC3945], the GMPLS control
   plane can be applied to a technology by controlling the data plane
   and switching characteristics of that technology. The architecture
   includes a clear separation between a control plane and a data plane.
   Control plane and data plane separation allows the GMPLS control
   plane to remain architecturally and functionally unchanged while
   controlling different technologies.  The architecture also requires



Fedyk, et. al.                Informational                    [Page 10]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-ethernet-arch-00.txt    Feb 6, 2008


   IP connectivity for the control plane to exchange information, but
   does not otherwise require an IP data plane.

   All aspects of GMPLS, i.e., addressing, signaling, routing and link
   management, may be applied to Ethernet switching.  GMPLS can provide
   control for traffic engineered and protected Ethernet service paths.
   This document defines the term "Eth-LSP" to refer to Ethernet service
   paths that are controlled via GMPLS. As is the case with all GMPLS
   controlled services, Eth-LSPs can leverage common traffic engineering
   attributes such as:

   - bandwidth profile;
   - priority level;
   - preemption characteristics;
   - protection/resiliency capability;
   - routing policy, such as an explicit route;
   - bi-directional service;
   - end-to-end and segment protection;
   - hierarchy

   The bandwidth profile may be used, to set committed information rate
   and peak information rate, and policies based on either under-
   subscription or over-subscription.  Services covered by this
   framework MUST have a TSpec that follows the Ethernet Traffic
   parameters defined in [ETH-TSPEC].

   In applying GMPLS to Ethernet, GMPLS will be extended to work with
   the Ethernet data plane and switching functions.  The definition of
   GMPLS support for Ethernet is multi-faceted due to the different
   forwarding/switching functions inherent in the different service
   types discussed in Section 2.1. In general, the header fields used in
   the forwarding/switching function, e.g. VID and DMAC, can be
   characterized as a data plane label.  In some circumstances these
   fields will be constant along the path of the Eth-LSP, and in others
   they may vary hop-by-hop or at certain interfaces only along the
   path. In the case where the "labels" must be forwarded unchanged,
   there are a few constraints on the label allocation that are similar
   to some other technologies such as lambda labels.

   The general characteristics of the IEEE 802.1Q [802.1Q] data plane
   are left unchanged. The VID is used as a "filter" pointing to a
   particular forwarding table, and if the DMAC is found in that
   forwarding table the forwarding decision is taken based on the DMAC.
   When forwarding using an Ethernet spanning tree, if the DMAC is not
   found the frame is broadcast over all outgoing interfaces for which
   that VID is defined. This valid MAC checking and broadcast supports
   Ethernet learning. The amendment to IEEE802.1Q that is specified
   under IEEE802.1Qay allows for turning off learning and hence this

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-ethernet-arch-00.txt    Feb 6, 2008


   broadcast mechanism. A special case is when a VID is defined for only
   two ports on one bridge, in that case all frames with that VID
   received over one of these ports are forward over the over port.

   This document does not define any specific format for an Eth-LSP
   label. Rather, it is expected that service specific documents will
   define any signaling and routing extensions needed to support that
   specific Ethernet service.  Depending on the requirements of a
   service, it may be necessary to define multiple GMPLS protocol
   extensions and procedures. It is expected that all such extensions
   will be consistent with this document.

   It is expected that key a requirement will be to describe label
   formats and encodings. It may also be necessary to provide a
   mechanism to identify the required Ethernet service type in signaling
   and a way to advertise the capabilities of Ethernet switches in the
   routing protocols. These mechanisms must make it possible to
   distinguish between requests for different paradigms including new,
   future, and existing paradigms.

   The Switching Type is defined in [RFC3945] and [RFC3471] as
   indicating the type of switching that should be performed on a
   particular link for an LSP. The L2SC switching type may already be
   used by implementations performing layer 2 switching including
   Ethernet. To support the continued use of that switching type and
   those implementations, a new switching type may be required for each
   new Ethernet switching paradigm that is supported.

   The Switching Type and Interface Switching Capability Descriptor
   share a common set of values and are defined in [RFC3945], [RFC3471],
   and [RFC4202] as indicators of the type of switching that should
   ([RFC3471]) and can ([RFC4202]) be performed on a particular link for
   an LSP. The L2SC switching type is available for use by
   implementations performing layer 2 switching including ATM and
   Ethernet. To support the continued use of that switching type by
   existing implementations as well as to distinguish between each new
   Ethernet switching paradigm, a new switching type is expected to be
   needed for each new Ethernet switching paradigm that is supported.

   For discussion purposes, we decompose the problem of applying GMPLS
   into the functions of Routing, Signaling, Link Management and Path
   Selection. It is possible to use some functions of GMPLS alone or in
   partial combinations. In most cases using all functions of GMPLS
   leads to less operational overhead than partial combinations.

4. GMPLS Routing and Addressing Model

   The GMPLS Routing and Addressing Model is not modified by this
   document.  GMPLS control for Eth-LSPs uses the Routing and Addressing
   Model described in [RFC3945].  Most notably this includes the use of
   IP addresses to identify interfaces and LSP end-points.  It also
   includes support for both numbered and unnumbered interfaces.

   In the case where another address family or type of identifier is
   required to support an Ethernet service, extensions may be defined to
   provide mapping to an IP address.  Extensions to support non-IP based
   LSP identification in signaling, i.e., replacement of the IP address
   in the RSVP SESSION or SENDER_TSPEC objects, are not permitted under
   this framework.


4.1. GMPLS Routing

   GMPLS routing [RFC4202] is IP routing with the opaque TLV extensions
   for the purpose of distributing GMPLS related TE (router and link)
   information. As is always the case with GMPLS, TE information is
   populated with TE resources coordinated with LMP or from
   configuration if LMP is not available. The bandwidth resources of the
   links are tracked as Eth-LSPs are set up. Interfaces supporting the
   switching of Eth-LSPs are identified using the appropriate Interface
   Switching Capabilities. As mentioned in Section 2, it will be
   necessary to define one or more new Interface Switching Capabilities
   to support Eth-LSPs.  The L2SC Interface Switching Capabilities MUST
   NOT be used to represent interfaces capable of supporting Eth-LSPs.
   Interface Switching Capability specific TE information may be defined
   as needed to support the requirements of a specific Ethernet
   Switching Service Type.

   GMPLS Routing is an optional piece but it is highly valuable in
   maintaining topology and distributing the TE database for path
   management and dynamic path computation.


4.2. Control Plane Network

   In order for a GMPLS control plane to operate, an IP network of
   sufficient capacity to handle the information exchange between the
   GMPLS routing and signaling protocols is necessary.

   One way to implement this is with an IGP that views each switch as a
   terminated IP adjacency. In other words, IP traffic and a simple
   routing table are available for the control plane but there is no
   requirement for a high performance IP data plane.



Fedyk, et. al.                Informational                    [Page 13]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-ethernet-arch-00.txt    Feb 6, 2008


   This IP connectivity can be provided as a separate independent
   network (out of band) or integrated with the Ethernet switches (in-
   band).


5. P2P Signaling

   GMPLS signaling, see [RFC3471], is well suited to the control of Eth-
   LSPs and Ethernet switches. Signaling enables the ability to
   dynamically establish a path from one ingress or egress node. The
   signaled path may be completely static and not change for the
   duration of its lifetime. However, signaling also has the capability
   to dynamically adjust the path in a coordinated fashion after the
   path has been established. The range of signaling options from static
   to dynamic are under operator control. Standardized signaling also
   improves multi-vendor interoperability over simple management.

   GMPLS signaling supports the establishment and control of
   bidirectional and unidirectional data paths. Ethernet is bi-
   directional by nature and the CFM has been built to leverage this.
   Prior to CFM the emulation of a physical wire and the learning
   requirements also mandated bi-direction connections. Given this, Eth-
   LSPs MUST always use paths that share the same routes and fates. Eth-
   LSPs may be either P2P or P2MP (see [RFC4875]).  GMPLS signaling also
   allows for full and partial LSP protection; see [RFC4872] and
   [RFC4873].

   Note that standard GMPLS does not support different bandwidth in each
   direction of a bidirectional LSP. See [GMPLS-ASYM] if asymmetric
   bandwidth bidirectional LSPs are required.


6. Link Management

   Link discovery has been specified for Ethernet in [IEEE802.1AB].
   However the 802.1AB capability is an optional feature and is not
   necessarily operating before the Link is operational it primarily
   supports the management plane. The benefits of running link discovery
   in large systems are significant. Link discovery may reduce
   configuration and reduce the possibility of undetected errors in
   configuration as well as exposing misconnections.

   In the GMPLS context, LMP [RFC4204] has been defined to support link
   management and discovery features.  LMP also supports the creation of
   unnumbered interfaces can be automated. If LMP is not used there is
   an additional provisioning requirement to add GMPLS link identifiers.
   For large-scale implementations LMP would be beneficial. LMP also has
   Fault Management capabilities that overlap with [IEEE802.1ag] and



Fedyk, et. al.                Informational                    [Page 14]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-ethernet-arch-00.txt    Feb 6, 2008


   [Y.1731].  It is recommended that LMP not be used for Fault
   management and instead the native Ethernet methods be used.

   LMP and 802.1AB are relatively independent. The LMP capability should
   be sufficient to remove the need for 802.1AB but 802.1 AB can be run
   in parallel or independently if desired.  Figure 2 provides possible
   ways of using LMP, 802.1AB and 802.1ag in combination.

   Figure 2 illustrates the functional relationship of link management
   and OAM schemes.   It is intended that LMP would use functions of
   link property correlation but that Ethernet mechanisms for OAM such
   as CFM, link trace etc would be used for fault management and fault
   trace.

7. Path Computation and Selection

   GMPLS does not specify a specific method for selecting paths or
   supporting path computation. GMPLS allows for a wide ranges of
   possibilities supported from very simple path computation to very
   elaborate path coordination where a large number of coordinated paths
   are required.  The path computation could take the form of paths
   being computed either on a management station with local computation
   for rerouting or more sophisticated path computation servers.

   Eth-LSPs may be supported using any path selection or computation
   mechanism. As is the case with any GMPLS path selection function, and
   common to all path selection mechanisms, the path selection process
   should take into consideration Switching Capabilities and Encoding
   advertised for a particular interface. Eth-LSPs may also make use of
   the emerging path computation and selection work; see [PATH-COMP]


8. Multiple Domains

   This document will support the signaling of Ethernet parameters
   across multiple domains supporting both contiguous Eth-LSP and
   Hierarchical Ethernet LSPs. The intention is to support the GMPLS
   tools of hierarchy supporting Peer to Peer models, UNIs and NNIs.

   More detail will be added to the section in a later revision.


9. Security Considerations

   The architecture for GMPLS controlled Ethernet assumes that the
   network consists of trusted devices, but does not require that the
   ports over which a UNI is defined is trusted, nor does equipment
   connected to these ports need to be trusted. Access to the trusted
   domain SHALL only occur through the protocols defined in the UNI or
   NNI or through protected management interfaces. Where GMPLS is
   applied to the control of VLAN only, the commonly known techniques
   for mitigation of Ethernet DOS attacks may be required on UNI ports.
