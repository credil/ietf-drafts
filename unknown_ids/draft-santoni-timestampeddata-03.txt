     Abstract 

        This document describes a syntax which can be used to bind a generic 
        document (or any set of data, not necessarily protected by means of 
        cryptographic techniques) to one or more time-stamp tokens obtained 
        for that document, where "time-stamp token" has the meaning defined 
        in RFC 3161. Additional types of temporal evidence are also 
        supported.

     1. Introduction 

        Digital time stamping has become the standard technique for proving 
        the existence of a document before a certain point in time. Several 
        digital signature legislations around the world embrace the concept 
        and provide for time-stamping services as an approved means for 
        attesting the signing time and/or for extending the validity of 
        signed documents beyond the expiry date of the signer's certificate.

        However, while digital time stamping enhances digital signature, its 
        value does not depend on this latter. It can obviously be useful to 
        time-stamp a document even if this is not signed. And it can also be 
        useful, or even mandatory in some cases, to time-stamp a document in 
        its entirety, regardless of how many signatures it contains. 

        When a time-stamp is related to a digital signature, there already 
        exist a way to keep the two pieces together: RFC 3161 describes how 
        one or more TimeStampTokens can be included in a SignerInfo structure 
        as unsigned attributes. On the other hand, when time-stamps are not 
        related to a digital signature, there is no standard way to keep 
        together the time-stamped document and the related time-stamps.  

        In such cases two approaches are typically being adopted:

     Internet-Draft             timestampeddata                   March 2008 
         

        o  time-stamps are kept as separate files (keeping track of what 
           time-stamps belong to what documents is up to the user); 

        o  an ad hoc solution is adopted for specific applications, like e.g. 
           a ZIP archive or a proprietary "envelope" of some kind. 

        Both solutions impede interoperability, the objective of this memo. 

        This document proposes a simple syntax for bundling one document 
        (actually, any kind of file) to the corresponding temporal evidence, 
        this latter being typically represented by one or more RFC 3161 
        TimeStampTokens. Additional types of temporal evidence, like e.g. an 
        RFC 4998 EvidenceRecord, are also supported via an "open" syntax. 
        However, for the sake of interoperability, the emphasis is given to 
        TimeStampTokens. 

        The proposed syntax is broadly based on the Cryptographic Message 
        Syntax (CMS) defined in RFC 3852 [CMS]. 

     2. Syntax for TimeStampedData 

        The proposed data structure is called TimeStampedData and it is based 
        on the ContentInto envelope defined in [CMS]: 

         
        ContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE { 
           contentType ContentType, 
           content [0] EXPLICIT ANY DEFINED BY contentType } 

         
        ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER 

         
        While CMS defines six content types (data, signed-data, enveloped-
        data, digested-data, encrypted-data, and authenticated-data), this 
        memo defines an additional content type, timestamped-data, identified 
        by the following specific contentType OID: 

         
        id-timestamped-data OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) 
        us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs7(7) 9 } 

         
        This particular OID signals that the content field of the ContentInfo 
        has the following syntax:

     Internet-Draft             timestampeddata                   March 2008 
         

         
        TimeStampedData ::= SEQUENCE { 
           version        INTEGER { v1(1) }, 
           fileName       UTF8String, 
           mimeType       PrintableString, 
           content        OCTET STRING, 
           evidence       Evidence 
        } 

        Evidence ::= CHOICE { 
           timeStamps        [0] SET (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF TimeStampToken, 
           evidenceRecord    [1] EvidenceRecord 
           -- additional evidence types to be registered with the IETF 
        } 

         
        The version field contains the version number of the TimeStampedData 
        syntax. The initial version number is 1. 

        The fileName field contains the original filename of the document 
        which was time-stamped and whose content was inserted into the 
        TimeStampedData structure. 

        The mimeType field contains a MIME media type and subtype for the 
        bundled file (e.g. "text/rtf"), according to RFC 2045 [MIME]. It is 
        an advisory information which may help decide how to open or deal 
        with the file after having "detached" it from the TimeStampedData 
        structure, regardless of the filename extension (which could be 
        missing or unknown). 

        The content field carries the entire content, in its original format, 
        of the file which was time-stamped. The file need not be a document 
        in the strict sense; it can be any kind of file (e.g. an executable, 
        a database, etc). 

        The evidence field carries the evidence that the content data existed 
        before a certain point in time. The TimeStampedData syntax allows for 
        different types of evidence (like e.g. an EvidenceRecord according to 
        RFC 4998). However, this document mandates support for one type only: 
        a non-empy set of RFC 3161 TimeStampToken's [TSP]. 

        Additional types of evidence may be used after having registered them 
        (and having had a distinguishing tag assigned to them) with the IETF. 
        A suitable registration procedure should be defined for that purpose.

     3. Compliance requirements 

        Compliant applications MUST support the RFC 3161-based type of 
        evidence (i.e. the timeStamps CHOICE). 

        Compliant applications MUST always populate the mimeType field of 
        TimeStampedData structure with a valid MIME type/subtype string 
        according to RFC 2045 [MIME]. A valid example is "application/pdf". 
        An invalid example is "whatever". An empty string is not allowed. 

     4. Recommended processing 

        When generating the TimeStampedData structure, applications are 
        supposed to behave like follows: 

        o  populate the version field with the integer value v1(1); 

        o  populate the fileName field with the real name of the file; 

        o  populate the mimeType field with an appropriate MIME type/subtype 
           string, preferably, or at least with "application/octet-stream"; 

        o  populate the content field with the entire contents of the file in 
           its original format and encoding; 

        o  add the necessary evidence (e.g. one or more TimeStampTokens); 

        o  insert the TimeStampedData into a ContentInfo structure, with the 
           id-timestamped-data OID in the contentType field; 

        o  BER-encode the ContentInfo structure and save it with the same 
           name of the time-stamped file, but with the file extension 
           recommended in section 5. 

        When parsing an existing TimeStampedData structure, applications are 
        supposed to behave like follows: 

        o  check that the contentType field of the ContentInfo structure has 
           the expected value (id-timestamped-data) in its contentType field; 
           then, extract the inner TimeStampedData structure and continue 
           processing; 

        o  check the version field (it should be v1); 

        o  check the fileName field and keep it for later use; 

        o  check the mimeType field and keep it for later use;

        o  read the content field and prepare to save it in a separate file 
           and/or show it to the user (or otherwise deal with it); 

        o  check that the evidence field not be empty; extract the inner data 
           and prepare to show them to the user and/or save them to separate 
           files; 

        o  validate the evidence data (e.g. in case of timeStamps: check that 
           each TimeStampToken does indeed contain the hash of the document 
           and it was signed by a trusted TSA); 

        o  depending on the application, show the evidence data to the user; 

        o  depending on the application, show the time-stamped document to 
           the user, possibly by activating a suitable external "viewer" 
           based on the fileName extension and the mimeType field; 

        o  depending on the application, save the content field into a 
           separate file with the name specified by the fileName field (see 
           Security Considerations) or let the user specify the desired 
           filename. 

     5. Recommended file extensions 

        A file containing a TimeStampedData structure SHOULD bear the .tsd 
        extension. Example: "patent123.tsd" 

     6. Security Considerations 

        Any consumer of TimeStampedData should validate the entire filename 
        (carried in the filename field of the TimeStampedData structure) 
        according the rules of its local filesystem and its intended usage 
        before using some or all of the name to store the data. 

     7. IANA Considerations 

        This document defines one object identifier under the pkcs7 arc: 

        id-timestamped-data OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) 
        us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs7(7) 9 }
