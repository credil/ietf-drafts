                   Camellia Encryption for Kerberos 5
                     draft-krb-wg-kanno-camellia-00

Abstract

   This document is a specification for the addition of Camellia cipher
   to the Kerberos 5 cryptosystem suite.  The Camellia cipher was
   developed by NTT and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation in 2000, which
   is comparable to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

1.  Introduction

   This document defines encryption key and checksum types for Kerberos
   5 using the Camellia algorithm developed by NTT and Mitsubishi
   Electric Corporation in 2000.  These new types support 128-bit block
   encryption and key sizes of 128 or 256 bits.  It is same that
   interface speficiations as the AES.

   The Camellia algorithm and its properties are described in [RFC3713].

   Using the "simplified profile" of [RFC3961], we can define a pair of
   encryption and checksum schemes.  Camellia is used with ciphertext
   stealing (CTS) to avoid message expansion, and SHA-1 is the
   associated checksum function.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" that
   appear in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Protocol Key Representation

   The profile in [RFC3961] treats keys and random octet strings as
   conceptually different.  But since the AES key space is dense, we can
   use any bit string of appropriate length as a key.  We use the byte
   representation for the key described in [RFC3713], where the first
   bit of the bit string is the high bit of the first byte of the byte
   string (octet string) representation.


4.  Key Generation from Pass Phrases or Random Data

   Given the above format for keys, we can generate keys from the

   appropriate amounts of random data (128 or 256 bits) by simply
   copying the input string.

   To generate an encryption key from a pass phrase and salt string, the
   Camellia uses the PBKDF2 function from PKCS #5 v2.0 [RFC2898].  This
   function of Camellia can define as same specification of AES
   [RFC3962]

   The pseudorandom function used by PBKDF2 will be a SHA-1 HMAC of the
   passphrase and salt.  The case of AES described in Appendix B of
   [RFC3962].  For pseudorandom function, Camellia can use like an AES.


5.  CipherText Stealing mode

   The specification of CipherText Stealing (CTS) mode for Camellia
   complies with AES-CTS in [RFC3962].

   A test vector of Camellia-CTS is given in Section 10.


6.  Kerberos Algorithm Profile Parameters

   This is a summary of the parameters to be used with the simplified
   algorithm profile described in [RFC3961]:

   These checksum types will be used with the corresponding encryption
   types defined above.


8.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys for
   Camellia.  And no security problem has been found on Camellia (see
   [NESSIE], [CRYPTREC], and [LNCS]).

   For security considerations of CTS mode, this document refers to
   Section 8 of [RFC3962].


9.  IANA Considerations

   Kerberos encryption and checksum type values used in section 7 were
   previously reserved in [RFC3961] for the mechanisms defined in this
   document.  The registries have been updated to list this document as
   the reference.
