    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an architectural framework for the
      application of Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) in transport
      networks, by enabling the construction of packet switched equivalents to
      traditional circuit switched carrier networks. It describes a common set
      of protocol functions - the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) - that
      supports the operational models and capabilities typical of such
      networks for point-to-point paths, including signaled or explicitly
      provisioned bi-directional connection-oriented paths, protection and
      restoration mechanisms, comprehensive Operations, Administration and
      Maintenance (OAM) functions, and network operation in the absence of a
      dynamic control plane or IP forwarding support. Some of these functions
      exist in existing MPLS specifications, while others require extensions
      to existing specifications to meet the requirements of the MPLS-TP.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="Motivation and Background">
        <!--Updated in line with the requirements draft intro-->

        <t>This document describes a framework for a Multiprotocol Label
        Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). It presents the architectural
        framework for MPLS-TP, defining those elements of MPLS applicable to
        supporting the requirements in <xref target="RFC5654"></xref> and what
        new protocol elements are required.</t>

        <t>Historically the optical transport infrastructure (Synchronous
        Optical Networking (SONET)/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH),
        Optical Transport Network (OTN)) has provided carriers with a high
        benchmark for reliability and operational simplicity. To achieve this
        transport technologies have been designed with specific
        characteristics :</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Strictly connection-oriented connectivity, which may be
            long-lived and may be provisioned manually or by network
            management.</t>

            <t>A high level of protection and availability.</t>

            <t>Quality of service.</t>

            <t>Extended OAM capabilities.</t>
          </list>Carriers wish to evolve such transport networks to support
        packet based services, and to take advantage of the flexibility and
        cost benefits of packet switching technology. While MPLS is a maturing
        packet technology that is already playing an important role in
        transport networks and services, not all of MPLS's capabilities and
        mechanisms are needed and/or consistent with transport network
        operations. There are also transport technology characteristics that
        are not currently reflected in MPLS.</t>

        <t>The types of packet transport services delivered by transport
        networks are very similar to Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks defined
        by the IETF.</t>

        <t>There are thus two objectives for MPLS-TP:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>To enable MPLS to be deployed in a transport network and
            operated in a similar manner to existing transport
            technologies.</t>

            <t>To enable MPLS to support packet transport services with a
            similar degree of predictability to that found in existing
            transport networks.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In order to achieve these objectives, there is a need to create a
        common set of new functions that are applicable to both MPLS networks
        in general, and those belonging to the MPLS-TP profile.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP therefore defines a profile of MPLS targeted at transport
        applications and networks. This profile specifies the specific MPLS
        characteristics and extensions required to meet transport
        requirements.</t>

      <section title="Scope">
        <t>This document describes an architectural framework for the
        application of MPLS to transport networks. It specifies the common set
        of protocol functions that meet the requirements in <xref

        Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). The architecture for point-to-point
        MPLS-TP paths is described. The architecture for point-to-multipoint
        paths is outside the scope of this document.</t>

          MPLS-TP Provider Edge (MPLS-TP PE) or an MPLS-TP Provider (MPLS-TP P
          Router) router for a given LSP, as defined below. The terms MPLS-TP

          <section title="MPLS-TP Provider Edge Router (PE)">
            <t>An MPLS-TP Provider Edge Router is an MPLS-TP LSR that adapts
            client traffic and encapsulates it to be carried over an MPLS-TP
            LSP. Encapsulation may be as simple as pushing a label, or it may
            require the use of a pseudowire. An MPLS-TP PE exists at the
            interface between a pair of layer networks. For an MS-PW, an
            MPLS-TP PE may be either an S-PE or a T-PE.</t>

            <t>An MPLS-TP Provider router is an MPLS-TP LSR that does not
            provide MPLS-TP PE functionality. An MPLS-TP P router switches
            LSPs which carry client traffic, but do not adapt the client

          side of the MPLS-TP network are peers and view the MPLS-TP network
          as a single point to point or point to multi-point link. These

      <section title="Packet Transport Services">
        <t>One objective of MPLS-TP is to enable MPLS networks to provide
        packet transport services with a similar degree of predictability to
        that found in existing transport networks. Such packet transport
        services inherit a number of characteristics, defined in <xref
        target="RFC5654"></xref>:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>In an environment where an MPLS-TP layer network is supporting
            a client layer network, and the MPLS-TP layer network is supported
            by a server layer network then operation of the MPLS-TP layer
            network MUST be possible without any dependencies on the server or
            client layer network.</t>

            <t>The service provided by the MPLS-TP network to the client is
            guaranteed not to fall below the agreed level regardless of other
            client activity.</t>

            <t>The control and management planes of any client network layer
            that uses the service is isolated from the control and management
            planes of the MPLS-TP layer network.</t>

            <t>Where a client network makes use of an MPLS-TP server that
            provides a packet transport service, the level of co-ordination
            required between the client and server layer networks is minimal
            (preferably no co-ordination will be required).</t>

            <t>The complete set of packets generated by a client MPLS(-TP)
            layer network using the packet transport service, which may
            contain packets that are not MPLS packets (e.g. IP or CNLS packets
            used by the control/management plane of the client MPLS(-TP) layer
            network), are transported by the MPLS-TP server layer network.</t>

            <t>The packet transport service enables the MPLS-TP layer network
            addressing and other information (e.g. topology) to be hidden from
            any client layer networks using that service, and vice-versa.</t>
          </list>Therefore, a packet transport service doe not support a
        connectionless packet switched forwarding mode. However, this does not
        preclude it carrying client traffic associated with a connectionless
        service.</t>

      <section title="Scope of MPLS Transport Profile">
        <t><xref target="mpls-tp-scope"></xref> illustrates the scope of
        MPLS-TP. MPLS-TP solutions are primarily intended for packet transport
        applications. MPLS-TP is a strict sub-set of MPLS, and comprises those
        functions that meet the requirements of <xref
        target="RFC5654"></xref>. This includes MPLS functions that were
        defined prior to <xref target="RFC5654"></xref> but that meet the
        requirements of <xref target="RFC5654"></xref>, together with
        additional functions defined to meet those requirements. Some MPLS
        functions defined before <xref target="RFC5654"></xref> e.g. Equal
        Cost Multi-Path, LDP signaling used in such a way that it creates
        multi-point to point LSPs, and IP forwarding in the data plane are
        explicitly excluded from MPLS-TP by that requirements
        specification.</t>

        <t>Note that this does not preclude the future definition of MPLS
        functions that do not meet the requirements of <xref
        target="RFC5654"></xref> and thus fall outside the scope of MPLS-TP as
        defined by this document.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">

          </list></t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP architecture for LSPs and PWs includes the the
        following two sets of functions:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>MPLS-TP adaptation </t>

            <t>MPLS-TP forwarding </t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The adaptation functions interface the client service to MPLS-TP.
        This includes the case where the client service is an MPLS-TP LSP.</t>

        <t>The forwarding functions comprise the mechanisms required for
        forwarding the encapsulated client over an MPLS-TP server layer
        network E.g. PW label and LSP label.</t>

        <section anchor="FWD" title="MPLS-TP Adaptation " toc="default">
          <t>The MPLS-TP adaptation interfaces the client service to MPLS-TP.
          For pseudowires, these adaptation functions are the payload
          encapsulation shown in Figure 7 of <xref target="RFC3985"></xref>
          and Figure 7 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch"></xref>. For
          network layer client services, the adaptation function uses the MPLS
          encapsulation format as defined in RFC 3032<xref
          target="RFC3032"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The purpose of this encapsulation is to abstract the client
          service data plane from the MPLS-TP data plane, thus contributing to
          the independent operation of the MPLS-TP network.</t>

          <t>MPLS-TP is itself a client of an underlying server layer. MPLS-TP
          is thus also bounded by a set of adaptation functions to this server
          layer network, which may itself be MPLS-TP. These adaptation
          functions provide encapsulation of the MPLS-TP frames and for the
          transparent transport of those frames over the server layer network.
          The MPLS-TP client inherits its QoS from the MPLS-TP network, which
          in turn inherits its QoS from the server layer. The server layer
          must therefore provide the necessary Quality of Service (QoS) to
          ensure that the MPLS-TP client QoS commitments are satisfied.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="MPLS-TP Forwarding Functions">
          <t>The forwarding functions comprise the mechanisms required for
          forwarding the encapsulated client over an MPLS-TP server layer
          network E.g. PW label and LSP label.</t>

          <t>MPLS-TP LSPs use the MPLS label switching operations and TTL
          processing procedures defined in <xref target="RFC3031"></xref> and
          <xref target="RFC3032"></xref>. These operations are highly
          optimized for performance and are not modified by the MPLS-TP
          profile.</t>

          <t>In addition, MPLS-TP PWs use the PW and MS-PW forwarding
          operations defined in<xref target="RFC3985"></xref> and <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch"></xref>. The PW label is processed
          by a PW forwarder and is always at the bottom of the label stack for
          a given MPLS-TP layer network.</t>

          <t>Per-platform label space is used for PWs. Either per-platform,
          per-interface or other context-specific label space may be used for
          LSPs.</t>

          <t>MPLS-TP forwarding is based on the label that identifies the
          transport path (LSP or PW). The label value specifies the processing
          operation to be performed by the next hop at that level of
          encapsulation. A swap of this label is an atomic operation in which
          the contents of the packet after the swapped label are opaque to the
          forwarder. The only event that interrupts a swap operation is TTL
          expiry. This is a fundamental architectural construct of MPLS to be
          taken into account when design protocol extensions that requires
          packets (e.g. OAM packets) to be sent to an intermediate LSR.</t>

          <t>Further processing to determine the context of a packet occurs
          when a swap operation is interrupted in this manner, or a pop
          operation exposes a specific reserved label at the top of the stack.
          Otherwise the packet is forwarded according to the procedures in
          <xref target="RFC3032"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Point to point MPLS-TP LSPs can be either unidirectional or
          bidirectional.</t>

          <t>It MUST be possible to configure an MPLS-TP LSP such that the
          forward and backward directions of a bidirectional MPLS-TP LSP are
          co-routed i.e. they follow the same path. The pairing relationship
          between the forward and the backward directions must be known at
          each LSR or LER on a bidirectional LSP.</t>

          <t>In normal conditions, all the packets sent over a PW or an LSP
          follow the same path through the network and those that belong to a
          common ordered aggregate are delivered in order. For example
          per-packet equal cost multi-path (ECMP) load balancing is not
          applicable to MPLS-TP LSPs.</t>

          <t>Penultimate hop popping (PHP) is disabled on MPLS-TP LSPs by
          default.</t>

          <t>Both E-LSP and L-LSP are supported in MPLS-TP, as defined in
          <xref target="RFC3270"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The Traffic Class field (formerly the MPLS EXP field) follows the
          definition and processing rules of <xref target="RFC5462"></xref>
          and <xref target="RFC3270"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Only the pipe and short-pipe models are supported in MPLS-TP.</t>

          attachment circuit between the CE node on the left and its
          corresponding provider edge (PE) node that provides the service
          interface, a bidirectional LSP across the MPLS-TP service network to
          the corresponding PE node on the right, and an attachment circuit
          between that PE node and the corresponding CE node for this
          service.</t>

          <t>At the ingress service interface the PE transforms the ingress
          packet to the format that will be carried over the transport
          network, and similarly the corresponding service interface at the
          egress PE transforms the packet to the format needed by the attached
          CE. The attachment circuits may be heterogeneous (e.g., any
          combination of SDH, PPP, Frame Relay etc) and network layer protocol
          payloads arrive at the service interface encapsulated in the
          Layer1/Layer2 encoding defined for that access link type. It should
          be noted that the set of network layer protocols includes MPLS and
          hence MPLS encoded packets with an MPLS label stack (the client MPLS
          stack), may appear at the service interface.</t>

          <t>Within the MPLS-TP transport network, the network layer protocols
          are carried over the MPLS-TP LSP using a separate MPLS label stack
          (the server stack). The server stack is entirely under the control
          of the nodes within the MPLS-TP transport network and it is not
          visible outside that network. In accordance with <xref
          target="RFC3032"></xref>, the bottom label, with the 'bottom of
          stack' bit set to '1', defines the network layer protocol being
          transported. <xref target="MPLS-TP-NL-Stack"></xref> shows how an a
          client network protocol stack (which may be an MPLS label stack and
          payload) is carried over as a network layer transport service over
          an MPLS-TP transport network.</t>

          <t>A label per network layer protocol payload type that is to be
          transported is REQUIRED. Such labels are referred to as "Service
          Labels", one of which is shown in <xref
          target="MPLS-TP-NL-Stack"></xref>. The mapping between protocol
          payload type and Service Label is either configured or signaled.</t>

          <t>Service labels are typically carried over an MPLS-TP edge-to-edge
          LSP, which is also shown in <xref target="MPLS-TP-NL-Stack"></xref>.
          The use of an edge-to-edge LSP is RECOMMENDED when more than one
          protocol payload type is to be transported. For example, if only
          MPLS is carried then a single Service Label would be used to
          provided both payload type indication and the MPLS-TP edge-to-edge
          LSP. Alternatively, if both IP and MPLS is to be carried then two
          Service Labels would be mapped on to a common MPLS-TP edge-to-edge
          LSP.</t>

          <t>As noted above, any layer 2 and layer 1 protocols used to carry
          the network layer protocol over the attachment circuit is terminated
          at the service interface and is not transported across the MPLS-TP
          network. This enables the use of different layer 2 / layer 1
          technologies at two service interfaces.</t>

          <t>At each service interface, Layer 2 addressing must be used to
          ensure the proper delivery of a network layer packet to the adjacent
          node. This is typically only an issue for LAN media technologies
          (e.g., Ethernet) which have Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. In
          cases where a MAC address is needed, the sending node MUST set the
          destination MAC address to an address that ensures delivery to the
          adjacent node. That is the CE sets the destination MAC address to an
          address that ensures delivery to the PE, and the PE sets the
          destination MAC address to an address that ensures delivery to the
          CE. The specific address used is technology type specific and is not
          covered in this document. In some technologies the MAC address will
          need to be configured (Examples for the Ethernet case include a
          configured unicast MAC address for the adjacent node, or even using
          the broadcast MAC address when the CE-PE service interface is
          dedicated. The configured address is then used as the MAC
          destination address for all packets sent over the service
          interface.)</t>

          <t>Note that when the two CEs operating over the network layer
          transport service are running a routing protocol such as ISIS or
          OSPF some care should be taken to configure the routing protocols to
          use point- to-point adjacencies. The specifics of such configuration
          is outside the scope of this document.</t>

          <t>[Editors Note we need to confer with ISIS and OSPF WG to verify
          that the cautionary note above is necessary and sufficient.]</t>

          <t>The CE to CE service types and corresponding labels may be
          configured or signaled. When they are signaled the CE to PE control
          channel may be either out-of-band or in-band. An out-of-band control
          channel uses standard GMPLS out-of-band signaling techniques. There
          are a number of methods that can be used to carry this
          signalling:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>It can be carried via an out-of-band control channel. (As is
              commonly done in today's GMPLS controlled transport
              networks.)</t>

              <t>It could be carried over the attachment circuit with MPLS
              using a reserved label.</t>

              <t>It could be carried over the attachment circuit with MPLS
              using a normal label that is agreed between CE and PE.</t>

              <t>It could be carried over the attachment circuit in an
              ACH.</t>

              <t>It could be carried over the attachment circuit in IP.</t>
            </list>In the MPLS and ACH cases above, this label value is used
          to carry LSP signaling without any further encapsulation. This
          signaling channel is always point-to-point and MUST use local CE and
          PE addressing.</t>

          <t>The method(s) to be used will be described in a future version of
          the document.</t>

      <section anchor="addr" title="Identifiers">
        <t>Identifiers to be used in within MPLS-TP where compatibility with
        existing MPLS control plane conventions are necessary are described in
        [draft-swallow-mpls-tp-identifiers-00]. The MPLS-TP requirements <xref
        target="RFC5654"></xref> require that the elements and objects in an
        MPLS-TP environment are able to be configured and managed without a
        control plane. In such an environment many conventions for defining
        identifiers are possible. However it is also anticipated that
        operational environments where MPLS-TP objects, LSPs and PWs will be
        signaled via existing protocols such as the Label Distribution
        Protocol <xref target="RFC4447"></xref> and the Resource Reservation
        Protocol as it is applied to Generalized Multi-protocol Label
        Switching ( <xref target="RFC3471"></xref> and <xref
        target="RFC3473"></xref>) (GMPLS).
        [draft-swallow-mpls-tp-identifiers-00] defines a set of identifiers
        for MPLS-TP which are both compatible with those protocols and
        applicable to MPLS-TP management and OAM functions.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP distinguishes between addressing used to identify nodes in
        the network, and identifiers used for demultiplexing and
        forwarding.</t>

        <t>Whilst IP addressing is used by default, MPLS-TP must be able to
        operate in environments where IP is not used in the forwarding plane.
        Therefore, the default mechanism for OAM demultiplexing in MPLS-TP
        LSPs and PWs is the generic associated channel. Forwarding based on IP
        addresses for user or OAM packets is not REQUIRED for MPLS-TP.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC4379"></xref>and BFD for MPLS LSPs <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-bfd-mpls"></xref> have defined alert mechanisms that
        enable an MPLS LSR to identify and process MPLS OAM packets when the
        OAM packets are encapsulated in an IP header. These alert mechanisms
        are based on TTL expiration and/or use an IP destination address in
        the range 127/8. These mechanisms are the default mechanisms for MPLS
        networks in general for identifying MPLS OAM packets when the OAM
        packets are encapsulated in an IP header. MPLS-TP is unable to rely on
        the availability of IP and thus uses the GACH/GAL to demultiplex OAM
        packets.</t>

      <section anchor="OAM"
               title="Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)">
        <t></t>

        <t>MPLS-TP supports a comprehensive set of OAM capabilities for packet
        transport applications, with equivalent capabilities to those provided
        in SONET/SDH.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP defines mechanisms to differentiate specific packets (e.g.
        OAM, APS, MCC or SCC) from those carrying user data packets on the
        same LSP. These mechanisms are described in <xref
        target="RFC5586"></xref>.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP requires <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements"></xref> that a set of OAM
        capabilities is available to perform fault management (e.g. fault
        detection and localization) and performance monitoring (e.g. packet
        delay and loss measurement) of the LSP, PW or section. The framework
        for OAM in MPLS-TP is specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework"></xref>.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP OAM packets share the same fate as their corresponding data
        packets, and are identified through the Generic Associated Channel
        mechanism <xref target="RFC5586"></xref>. This uses a combination of
        an Associated Channel Header (ACH) and a Generic Alert Label (GAL) to
        create a control channel associated to an LSP, Section or PW.</t>

        <section title="OAM Architecture">
          <t></t>

          <t>OAM and monitoring in MPLS-TP is based on the concept of
          maintenance entities, as described in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework"></xref>. A Maintenance
          Entity can be viewed as the association of two (or more) Maintenance
          End Points (MEPs) (see example in <xref target="tp-oam-ex"></xref>
          ). The MEPs that form an ME should be configured and managed to
          limit the OAM responsibilities of an OAM flow within a network or
          sub- network, or a transport path or segment, in the specific layer
          network that is being monitored and managed.</t>

          <t>Each OAM flow is associated with a single ME. Each MEP within an
          ME resides at the boundaries of that ME. An ME may also include a
          set of zero or more Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIPs), which
          reside within the Maintenance Entity. Maintenance end points (MEPs)
          are capable of sourcing and sinking OAM flows, while maintenance
          intermediate points (MIPs) can only sink or respond to OAM
          flows.</t>

              has historical significance dating back to the early days of the
              telephone network, but is equally applicable to the hierarchal
              architectures commonly employed in todays packet networks.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Individual MIPs along the path of an LSP or PW are addressed by
          setting the appropriate TTL in the label for the OAM packet, as per
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw"></xref>. Note that this
          works when the location of MIPs along the LSP or PW path is known by
          the MEP. There may be cases where this is not the case in general
          MPLS networks e.g. following restoration using a facility bypass
          LSP. In these cases, tools to trace the path of the LSP may be used
          to determine the appropriate setting for the TTL to reach a specific
          MIP.</t>

          <t>Within an LSR or PE, MEPs and MIPs can only be placed where MPLS
          layer processing is performed on a packet. The architecture mandates
          that this must occur at least once. </t>

          <t>There is only one MIP on an LSP or PW in each node. That MIP is
          for all applicable OAM functions on its associated LSP or PW. This
          document does not specify the default position of the MIP within the
          node. Therefore, this document does not specify where the exception
          mechanism resides (i.e. at the ingress interface, the egress
          interface, or some other location within the node). An optional
          protocol may be developed that sets the position of a MIP along the
          path of an LSP or PW within the node (and thus determines the
          exception processing location). </t>

          <t>MEPs may only act as a sink of OAM packets when the label
          associated with the LSP or PW for that ME is popped. MIPs can only
          be placed where an exception to the normal forwarding operation
          occurs. A MEP may act as a source of OAM packets whereever a label
          is pushed or swapped. For example, on a MS-PW, a MEP may source OAM
          within an S-PE or a T-PE, but a MIP may only be associated with a
          S-PE and a sink MEP can only be associated with a T-PE.</t>

        <section title="OAM Functions">
          <t>The MPLS-TP OAM architecture support a wide range of OAM
          functions, including the following <list style="symbols">
              <t>Continuity Check</t>

              <t>Connectivity Verification</t>

          <t>These are applicable to any layer defined within MPLS-TP, i.e.
          MPLS Section, LSP and PW.</t>

          <t>The MPLS-TP OAM toolset needs to be able to operate without
          relying on a dynamic control plane or IP functionality in the
          datapath. In the case of MPLS-TP deployment with IP functionality,
          all existing IP-MPLS OAM functions, e.g. LSP-Ping, BFD and VCCV, may
          be used. This does not preclude the use of other OAM tools in an IP
          addressable network.</t>

          <t>One use of OAM mechanisms is to detect link failures, node
          failures and performance outside the required specification which
          then may be used to trigger recovery actions, according to the
          requirements of the service.</t>

      <section anchor="GENERICACH" title="Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh)">
        <t>For correct operation of the OAM it is important that the OAM
        packets fate share with the data packets. In addition in MPSL-TP it is
        necessary to discriminate between user data payloads and other types
        of payload. For example the packet may contain a Signaling
        Communication Channel (SCC), or a channel used for Automatic
        Protection Switching (APS) data. Such packets are carried on a control
        channel associated to the LSP, Section or PW. This is achieved by
        carrying such packets on a generic control channel associated to the
        LSP, PW or section.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP makes use of such a generic associated channel (G-ACh) to
        support Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security
        (FCAPS) functions by carrying packets related to OAM, APS, SCC, MCC or
        other packet types in band over LSPs or PWs. The G-ACH is defined in
        <xref target="RFC5586"></xref> and it is similar to the Pseudowire
        Associated Channel <xref target="RFC4385"></xref>, which is used to
        carry OAM packets across pseudowires. The G-ACH is indicated by a
        generic associated channel header (ACH), similar to the Pseudowire
        VCCV control word, and this is present for all Sections, LSPs and PWs
        making use of FCAPS functions supported by the G-ACH.</t>

        <t>For pseudowires, the G-ACh use the first nibble of the pseudowire
        control word to provide the initial discrimination between data
        packets a packets belonging to the associated channel, as described
        in<xref target="RFC4385"></xref>. When the first nibble of a packet,
        immediately following the label at the bottom of stack, has a value of
        one, then this packet belongs to a G-ACh. The first 32 bits following
        the bottom of stack label then have a defined format called an
        associated channel header (ACH), which further defines the content of
        the packet. The ACH is therefore both a demultiplexer for G-ACh
        traffic on the PW, and a discriminator for the type of G-ACh
        traffic.</t>

        <t>When the OAM, or a similar message is carried over an LSP, rather
        than over a pseudowire, it is necessary to provide an indication in
        the packet that the payload is something other than a user data
        packet. This is achieved by including a reserved label with a value of
        13 in the label stack. This reserved label is referred to as the
        'Generic Alert Label (GAL)', and is defined in <xref
        target="RFC5586"></xref>. When a GAL is found anywhere within the
        label stack it indicates that the payload begins with an ACH. The GAL
        is thus a demultiplexer for G-ACh traffic on the LSP, and the ACH is a
        discriminator for the type of traffic carried on the G-ACh. Note
        however that MPLS-TP forwarding follows the normal MPLS model, and
        that a GAL is invisible to an LSR unless it is the top label in the
        label stack. The only other circumstance under which the label stack
        may be inspected for a GAL is when the TTL has expired. Any MPLS-TP
        component that intentionally performs this inspection must assume that
        it is asynchronous with respect to the forwarding of other packets.
        All operations on the label stack are in accordance with <xref
        target="RFC3031"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3032"></xref>.</t>

        <t>In MPLS-TP, the 'Generic Alert Label (GAL)' always appears at the
        bottom of the label stack (i.e. S bit set to 1), however this does not
        preclude its use elsewhere in the label stack in other
        applications.</t>

        <t>The G-ACH MUST only be used for channels that are an adjunct to the
        data service. Examples of these are OAM, APS, MCC and SCC, but the use
        is not restricted to those names services. The G-ACH MUST NOT be used
        to carry additional data for use in the forwarding path, i.e. it MUST
        NOT be used as an alternative to a PW control word, or to define a PW
        type.</t>

        <t>Since the G-ACh traffic is indistinguishable from the user data
        traffic at the server layer, bandwidth and QoS commitments apply to
        the gross traffic on the LSP, PW or section. Protocols using the G-ACh
        must therefore take into consideration the impact they have on the
        user data that they are sharing resources with. In addition, protocols
        using the G-ACh MUST conform to the security and congestion
        considerations described in <xref target="RFC5586"></xref>. .</t>

        depicting how the control channel is associated with the pseudowire
        protocol stack. This is based on the reference model for VCCV shown in

        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane is based on a combination of the
        LDP-based control plane for pseudowires <xref target="RFC4447"></xref>
        and the RSVP-TE based control plane for MPLS-TP LSPs <xref
        target="RFC3471"></xref>. Some of the RSVP-TE functions that are
        required for LSP signaling for MPLS-TP are based on GMPLS.</t>

        <t>The distributed MPLS-TP control plane provides the following
        functions:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">

            <t>Routing</t>

            <t>Traffic engineering and constraint-based path computation</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In a multi-domain environment, the MPLS-TP control plane supports
        different types of interfaces at domain boundaries or within the
        domains. These include the User-Network Interface (UNI), Internal
        Network Node Interface (I-NNI), and External Network Node Interface
        (E-NNI). Note that different policies may be defined that control the
        information exchanged across these interface types.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane is capable of activating MPLS-TP OAM
        functions as described in the OAM section of this document <xref
        target="OAM"></xref> e.g. for fault detection and localization in the
        event of a failure in order to efficiently restore failed transport
        paths.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane supports all MPLS-TP data plane
        connectivity patterns that are needed for establishing transport paths
        including protected paths as described in the survivability section
        <xref target="SURVIVE"></xref> of this document. Examples of the
        MPLS-TP data plane connectivity patterns are LSPs utilizing the fast
        reroute backup methods as defined in <xref target="RFC4090"></xref>
        and ingress-to-egress 1+1 or 1:1 protected LSPs.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane provides functions to ensure its own
        survivability and to enable it to recover gracefully from failures and
        degradations. These include graceful restart and hot redundant
        configurations. Depending on how the control plane is transported,
        varying degrees of decoupling between the control plane and data plane
        may be achieved.</t>

          unidirectional, bi-directional and multicast types of LSPs. The
          route of a transport path is typically calculated in the ingress
          node of a domain and the RSVP explicit route object (ERO) is
          utilized for the setup of the transport path exactly following the
          given route. GMPLS based MPLS-TP LSPs must be able to inter-operate

      <section anchor="static" title="Static Operation of LSPs and PWs ">
        <t>A PW or LSP may be statically configured without the support of a
        dynamic control plane. This may be either by direct configuration of
        the PEs/LSRs, or via a network management system. The collateral
        damage that loops can cause during the time taken to detect the
        failure may be severe. When static configuration mechanisms are used,
        care must be taken to ensure that loops to not form.</t>

      <section anchor="SURVIVE" title="Survivability">
        <t>Survivability requirements for MPLS-TP are specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk"></xref>.</t>

        <t>A wide variety of resiliency schemes have been developed to meet
        the various network and service survivability objectives. For example,
        as part of the MPLS/PW paradigms, MPLS provides methods for local
        repair using back-up LSP tunnels (<xref target="RFC4090"></xref>),
        while pseudowire redundancy <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy"></xref> supports scenarios where the
        protection for the PW can not be fully provided by the PSN layer (i.e.
        where the backup PW terminates on a different target PE node than the
        working PW). Additionally, GMPLS provides a well known set of control
        plane driven protection and restoration mechanisms <xref
        target="RFC4872"></xref>. MPLS-TP provides additional protection
        mechanisms that are optimised for both linear topologies and ring
        topologies, and that operate in the absence of a dynamic control
        plane. These are specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Different protection schemes apply to different deployment
        topologies and operational considerations. Such protection schemes may
        provide different levels of resiliency. For example, two concurrent
        traffic paths (1+1), one active and one standby path with guaranteed
        bandwidth on both paths (1:1) or one active path and a standby path
        that is shared by one or more other active paths (shared protection).
        The applicability of any given scheme to meet specific requirements is
        outside the current scope of this document.</t>

        <t>The characteristics of MPLS-TP resiliency mechanisms are listed
        below.<list style="symbols">
            <t>Optimised for linear, ring or meshed topologies.</t>

            <t>Use OAM mechanisms to detect and localize network faults or
            service degenerations.</t>

            <t>Include protection mechanisms to coordinate and trigger
            protection switching actions in the absence of a dynamic control
            plane. This is known as an Automatic Protection Switching (APS)
            mechanism.</t>

            <t>MPLS-TP recovery schemes are applicable to all levels in the
            MPLS-TP domain (i.e. MPLS section, LSP and PW), providing segment
            and end-to- end recovery.</t>

            <t>MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms support the coordination of
            protection switching at multiple levels to prevent race conditions
            occurring between a client and its server layer.</t>

            <t>MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms can be data plane, control plane or
            management plane based.</t>

            <t>MPLS-TP supports revertive and non-revertive behavior.</t>

      <section anchor="NETMGT" title="Network Management">
        <t>The network management architecture and requirements for MPLS-TP
        are specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-req"></xref>. It
        derives from the generic specifications described in ITU-T
        G.7710/Y.1701 <xref target="G.7710"></xref> for transport
        technologies. It also incorporates the OAM requirements for MPLS
        Networks <xref target="RFC4377"></xref> and MPLS-TP Networks <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements"></xref> and expands on
        those requirements to cover the modifications necessary for fault,
        configuration, performance, and security in a transport network.</t>

        <t>The Equipment Management Function (EMF) of a MPLS-TP Network
        Element (NE) (i.e. LSR, LER, PE, S-PE or T-PE) provides the means
        through which a management system manages the NE. The Management
        Communication Channel (MCC), realized by the G-ACh, provides a logical
        operations channel between NEs for transferring Management
        information. For the management interface from a management system to
        a MPLS-TP NE, there is no restriction on which management protocol
        should be used. It is used to provision and manage an end-to-end
        connection across a network where some segments are create/managed,
        for examples by Netconf or SNMP and other segments by XML or CORBA
        interfaces. Maintenance operations are run on a connection (LSP or PW)
        in a manner that is independent of the provisioning mechanism. An
        MPLS-TP NE is not required to offer more than one standard management
        interface. In MPLS-TP, the EMF must be capable of statically
        provisioning LSPs for an LSR or LER, and PWs for a PE, as per <xref
        target="static"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Fault Management (FM) functions within the EMF of an MPLS-TP NE
        enable the supervision, detection, validation, isolation, correction,
        and alarm handling of abnormal conditions in the MPLS-TP network and
        its environment. FM must provide for the supervision of transmission
        (such as continuity, connectivity, etc.), software processing,
        hardware, and environment. Alarm handling includes alarm severity
        assignment, alarm suppression/aggregation/correlation, alarm reporting
        control, and alarm reporting.</t>

        <t>Configuration Management (CM) provides functions to control,
        identify, collect data from, and provide data to MPLS-TP NEs. In
        addition to general configuration for hardware, software protection
        switching, alarm reporting control, and date/time setting, the EMF of
        the MPLS-TP NE also supports the configuration of maintenance entity
        identifiers (such as MEP ID and MIP ID). The EMF also supports the
        configuration of OAM parameters as a part of connectivity management
        to meet specific operational requirements. These may specify whether
        the operational mode is one-time on-demand or is periodic at a
        specified frequency.</t>

        <t>The Performance Management (PM) functions within the EMF of an
        MPLS- TP NE support the evaluation and reporting of the behaviour of
        the NEs and the network. One particular requirement for PM is to
        provide coherent and consistent interpretation of the network
        behaviour in a hybrid network that uses multiple transport
        technologies. Packet loss measurement and delay measurements may be
        collected and used to detect performance degradation. This is reported
        via fault management to enable corrective actions to be taken (e.g.
        Protection switching), and via performance monitoring for Service
        Level Agreement (SLA) verification and billing. Collection mechanisms
        for performance data should be should be capable of operating
        on-demand or proactively.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The introduction of MPLS-TP into transport networks means that the
      security considerations applicable to both MPLS and PWE3 apply to those
      transport networks. Furthermore, when general MPLS networks that utilise
      functionality outside of the strict MPLS-TP profile are used to support
      packet transport services, the security considerations of that
      additional functionality also apply.</t>

      <t>For pseudowires, the security considerations of <xref
      target="RFC3985"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch"></xref> apply.</t>

      <t>Packets that arrive on an interface with a given label value should
      not be forwarded unless that label value was previously assigned to an
      LSP or PW to a peer LSR or PE that it reachable via that interface.</t>

      <t>Each MPLS-TP solution must specify the additional security
      considerations that apply.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA considerations resulting from specific elements of MPLS-TP
      functionality will be detailed in the documents specifying that
      functionality.</t>
