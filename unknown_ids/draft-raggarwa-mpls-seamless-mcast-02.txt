Abstract

   This document describes procedures for building inter-area point-to-
   multipoint (P2MP) segmented service LSPs by partitioning such LSPs
   into intra-area segments and using BGP as the inter-area routing and
   label distribution protocol. Within each IGP area the intra-area
   segments are either carried over intra-area P2MP LSPs, using P2MP LSP
   hierarchy, or instantiated using ingress replication. The intra-area
   P2MP LSPs may be signaled using P2MP RSVP-TE or P2MP mLDP. If ingress
   replication is used in an IGP area then MP2P LDP LSPs or P2P RSVP-TE
   LSPs may be used. The applications/services that use such an inter-
   area service LSP may be BGP MVPN, VPLS multicast or Internet
   multicast over MPLS.

2. Introduction

   This document describes procedures for building inter-area point-to-
   multipoint (P2MP) segmented service LSPs by partitioning such LSPs
   into intra-area segments and using BGP as the inter-area routing and
   label distribution protocol. Within each IGP area the intra-area
   segments are either carried over intra-area P2MP LSPs, using P2MP LSP
   hierarchy, or instantiated using ingress replication. The intra-area
   P2MP LSPs may be signaled using P2MP RSVP-TE or P2MP mLDP. If ingress
   replication is used in an IGP area then MP2P LDP LSPs or P2P RSVP-TE
   LSPs may be used. The applications/services that use such an inter-
   area service LSP may be BGP MVPN, VPLS multicast or Internet
   multicast over MPLS.

   The primary use case of such segmented P2MP service LSPs is when the
   PEs are in different areas but in the same AS and thousands or more
   of PEs require P2MP connectivity. This may be the case when MPLS is
   pushed further to the metro edge and the metros are in different
   areas. Seamless MPLS is the industry term to address this case
   [SEAMLESS-MPLS]. Thus one of the applicabilities of this document is
   that it describes the multicast procedures for seamless MPLS.

   It is to be noted that [BGP-MVPN], [VPLS-MCAST] already specify
   procedures for building segmented inter-AS P2MP service LSPs. This
   document complements those procedures as it extends the segmented
   P2MP LSP model such that it is applicable to inter-area P2MP service
   LSPs as well. Infact an inter-AS deployment could use inter-AS
   segmented P2MP LSPs as specified in [BGP-MVPN, VPLS-MCAST] where each
   intra-AS segment is constructed using inter-area segmented P2MP LSPs
   as specified in this document.


3. General Assumptions and Terminology

   Assume BGP is used as an inter-area routing and label distribution
   protocol for unicast /32 routes for the PEs. Assume ABRs act as Route
   Reflectors for these routes. Futhermore, assume ABRs set BGP Next Hop
   to self for these routes.

   Within an AS a P2MP service LSP is partitioned into 3 segments:
   ingress area segment, backbone area segment, and egress area segment.
   Within each area a segment is carried over an intra-area P2MP LSP.
   There could be either 1:1 or n:1 mapping between segments and a given
   intra-area P2MP LSP. The latter is realized using P2MP LSP hierarchy
   with upstream-assigned labels [RFC5331]. For simplicity we assume
   that P2MP LSP hierarchy is used even with 1:1 mapping, in which case
   the upstream-assigned label could be an implicit NULL.




Rekhter                                                         [Page 4]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-mpls-seamless-mcast-02.txt  December 2010


   The ingress area segment of a P2MP service LSP is rooted at PE (or at
   ASBR in the case where the P2MP service LSP spans multiple ASes).
   The leaves of this segment are other PEs and ABRs in the same area as
   the root PE.  The backbone area segment is rooted at an ABR that is
   connected to the ingress area (ingress ABR), and has as it leaves
   ABRs that are connected to the egress area(s).  The egress area
   segment is rooted at an ABR in the egress area (egress ABR), and has
   as its leaves PEs and ASBR in that egress area. Note that for a given
   P2MP service LSP there may be more than one backbone segment, each
   rooted at its own ingress ABR, and more than one egress area segment,
   each rooted at its own egress ABR.



4. Discovering the P2MP FEC of the Inter-Area P2MP Service LSP

   The P2MP FEC identifies the inter-area P2MP service LSP. The egress
   PEs need to learn this P2MP FEC in order to initiate the creation of
   the egress area segment of the P2MP inter-area service LSP.

   The P2MP FEC of the inter-area P2MP LSP is learned by the egress PEs
   either by configuration, or based on the application-specific
   procedures (e.g., MVPN-specific procedures, VPLS-specific
   procedures).


4.1. BGP MVPN

   Egress PEs discover the P2MP FEC of the service LSPs used by BGP MVPN
   using the I-PMSI or S-PMSI A-D routes that are originated by the
   ingress PEs or ASBRs following the procedures of [BGP-MVPN].  The
   NLRI of such routes encodes the P2MP FEC. The procedures in this
   document assume all ABRs act as Route Reflectors for MVPN auto-
   discovery (A-D) routes. The "Leaf Information Required" flag MUST be
   set in the P-Tunnel attribute carried in such routes.  Before any
   Leaf auto discovery route is avertised by a PE or ABR in the same
   area, as described in the following sections, an I-/S-PMSI
   autodiscovery route is advertised either with an explicit Tunnel Type
   and Tunnel Identifier in the PMSI Tunnel Attribute, if the Tunnel
   Identifier has already been assigned, or with a special Tunnel Type
   of "No tunnel information present" otherwise.

   To avoid requiring ABRs to participate in the propagation of C-
   multicast routes, this document requires ABRs NOT to modify BGP Next
   Hop when re-advertising I-PMSI/S-PMSI A-D routes. The egress PEs may
   advertise the C-multicast routes to RRs that are different than the
   ABRs. However ABRs still can be configured to be the Route Reflectors
   for C-multicast routes, in which case they will participate in the



Rekhter                                                         [Page 5]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-mpls-seamless-mcast-02.txt  December 2010


   propagation of C-multicast routes.


4.2. BGP VPLS or LDP VPLS with BGP A-D

   Egress PEs discover the P2MP FEC of the service LSPs used by VPLS,
   using using the VPLS A-D routes that are originated by the ingress
   PEs [BGP-VPLS, VPLS-AD] or S-PMSI A-D routes that are originated by
   the ingress PE [VPLS-P2MP]. The NLRI of such routes encodes the P2MP
   FEC. The "Leaf Information Required" flag MUST be set in the P-Tunnel
   attribute carried in such routes.  Before any Leaf auto discovery
   route is avertised by a PE or ABR in its own area, as described in
   the following sections, an VPLS/S-PMSI autodiscovery route is
   advertised either with an explicit Tunnel Type and Tunnel Identifier
   in the PMSI Tunnel Attribute, if the Tunnel Identifier has already
   been assigned, or with a special Tunnel Type of "No tunnel
   information present" otherwise.

   The procedures in this document assume all ABRs act as Route
   Reflectors for VPLS auto-discovery (A-D) routes. These ABRs/RRs do
   NOT modify BGP Next Hop when re-advertising these A-D routes.


4.3. Internet Multicast

   This section describes how the egress PEs discover the P2MP FEC when
   the application is internet multicast.

   An egress PE learns the (S/*, G) of a multicast stream as a result of
   receiving IGMP or PIM messages on one of its IP multicast interfaces.
   This (S/*, G) forms the P2MP FEC of the inter-area P2MP service LSP.
   This document assumes that for each (S/*,G) we have a distinct inter-
   area P2MP service LSP.


5. Procedures for constructing segmented inter-area P2MP LSP

   This section applies to the scenario where the egress PE and the
   ingress PE/ASBR are in different IGP areas.

Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-mpls-seamless-mcast-02.txt  December 2010


5.1. Egress PEs

   Once an egress PE discovers the P2MP FEC of an inter-area segmented
   P2MP service LSP, it MUST propagate this P2MP FEC in BGP in order to
   construct the segmented inter-area P2MP service LSP.


5.1.1. Determining the Ingress PE/ASBR

   The egress PE discovers the P2MP FEC of an inter-area P2MP Segmented
   Service LSP as described in section 3. When an egress PE discovers
   this P2MP FEC it MUST first determine the ingress PE/ASBR of such a
   FEC as follows.

   If the application is MVPN or VPLS the ingress PE/ASBR's address is
   the BGP next-hop of the MVPN or VPLS A-D route from which the P2MP
   FEC is derived.

   If the application is internet multicast then the unicast routes to
   multicast sources/RPs SHOULD carry the VRF Route Import Extended
   Community [BGP MVPN] where the IP address in the Global Administrator
   field is set to the IP address of PE advertising the unicast route.
   The Local Administrator field of this community MUST be set to 0. If
   it is not desirable to advertise the VRF Route Import Extended
   Community in unicast routes, then unicast routes to multicast sources
   MUST be advertised using the multicast SAFI i.e. SAFI 2 and the VRF
   Route Import Extended Community MUST be carried in such routes. The
   ingress PE address as determined by the egress PE is the IP address
   determined from the VRF Route Import Extended community, that is
   present in the best route to reach S/RP.


5.1.2. Originating a Leaf Auto-Discovery Route

   If the P2MP FEC was derived from a MVPN or VPLS A-D route then the
   egress PE MUST originate a Leaf auto-discovery (A-D) route if the
   MVPN or VPLS A-D route carries a P-Tunnel Attribute with the "Leaf
   Information Required" flag set.

   If the P2MP FEC was derived from an Internet Multicast S/*, G and the
   ingress PE's address is not the same as the egress PE, then the
   egress PE MUST originate a Leaf auto-discovery (A-D) route.


5.1.2.1. Leaf A-D Route for MVPN and VPLS

   If the P2MP FEC was derived from MVPN or VPLS A-D routes then the
   Route Key field of the Leaf A-D route contains the NLRI of the A-D



Rekhter                                                         [Page 7]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-mpls-seamless-mcast-02.txt  December 2010


   route from which the P2MP FEC was derived. This follows procedures
   described in [BGP-MVPN, VPLS-P2MP].


5.1.2.2. Leaf A-D Route for Internet Multicast

   If the application is internet multicast than the the MCAST-VPN NLRI
   of the Leaf A-D route is constructed as follows:

   The Route Key field of MCAST-VPN NLRI has the following format:

                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |      RD   (8 octets)              |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   | Multicast Source Length (1 octet) |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |  Multicast Source (Variable)      |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |  Multicast Group Length (1 octet) |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |  Multicast Group   (Variable)     |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |     Ingress PE IP Address         |
                   +-----------------------------------+

   RD is set to 0 for (S,G) state and all 1s for (*,G) state, Multicast
   Source is set to S for (S,G) state or RP for (*,G) state, Multicast
   Group is set to G, Multicast Source Length and Multicast Group Length
   is set to either 4 or 16 (depending on whether S/RP and G are IPv4 or
   IPv6 addresses), and Ingress PE IP Address is set to the address
   carried in the BGP Next Hop of the route to S/RP.

   The Originating Router's IP address field of MCAST-VPN NLRI is set to
   the address of the local PE (PE that originates the route).

   Thus the whole MCAST-VPN NLRI of the route has the following format:

                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |      RD   (8 octets)              |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   | Multicast Source Length (1 octet) |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |  Multicast Source (Variable)      |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |  Multicast Group Length (1 octet) |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |  Multicast Group   (Variable)     |
                   +-----------------------------------+



Rekhter                                                         [Page 8]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-mpls-seamless-mcast-02.txt  December 2010


                   |         Ingress PE IP Addr        |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |  Originating Router's IP address  |
                   +-----------------------------------+

   When the PE deletes (S,G)/(*,G) state that was created as a result of
   receiving PIM messages on one of its IP multicast interfaces, if the
   PE previousely originated a Leaf auto-discovery route for that state,
   then the PE SHOULD withdraw that route.

   The support of PIM-SM in ASM mode requires further details and they
   will be provided in the next revision.


5.1.2.3. Constructing Rest of the Leaf A-D Route

   The Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute of the route SHOULD
   be set to the same IP address as the one carried in the Originating
   Router's IP Address field of the route.

   To constrain distribution of this route, the originating PE
   constructs an IP-based Route Target community by placing the IP
   address of the egress ABR in the Global Administrator field of the
   community, with the Local Administrator field of this community set
   to 0. The originating PE then adds this Route Target Extended
   Community to this Leaf auto-discovery route. The egress ABR's address
   is the BGP next-hop of the BGP route to reach the ingress PE/ASBR.

   The PE then advertises this route to the (egress) ABR/RR.


5.2. Egress ABR

   When an egress ABR receives a Leaf auto-discovery route, or a
   withdraw of a previousely received Leaf auto-discovery route, and the
   Route Target extended community carried by the route contains the IP
   address of this ABR, then the following procedures will be executed.

   The egress ABR originates a Leaf A-D route, whose MCAST-VPN NLRI is
   constructed as follows.

   The Route Key field of MCAST-VPN NLRI is the same as the Route Key
   field of MCAST-VPN NLRI of the received Leaf A-D route. The
   Originating Router's IP address field of MCAST-VPN NLRI is set to the
   address of the local ABR (the ABR that originates the route).

   The Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute of the route SHOULD
   be set to the same IP address as the one carried in the Originating



Rekhter                                                         [Page 9]

   Router's IP Address field of the route.

   To constrain distribution of this route, the originating PE
   constructs an IP-based Route Target community by placing the IP
   address of the ingress ABR in the Global Administrator field of the
   community, with the Local Administrator field of this community set
   to 0, and sets the Extended Communities attribute of this Leaf auto-
   discovery route to that community. The ingress ABR is the BGP Next
   Hop of the route to the ingress PE/ASBR. If the RD of the received
   Leaf A-D route is 0, then the Ingress PE address is determined from
   the the received Leaf A-D route. If the RD of the received Leaf A-D
   route is not 0, the ABR finds an MVPN I-PMSI/S-PMSI A-D route or VPLS
   A-D or S-PMSI A-D route whose NLRI has the same value as the Route
   Key field of the the Leaf A-D route. The BGP next-hop of this NLRI is
   the address of the ingress PE.

   To carry information identifying the upstream PE/ABR that has to
   process this Leaf Auto-Discovery route, the originating PE constructs
   an IP-based Route Target community by placing the IP address of the
   ingress ABR in the Global Administrator field of the community, with
   the Local Administrator field of this community set to 0, and sets
   the Extended Communities attribute of this Leaf auto-discovery route
   to that community. The ingress ABR is the BGP Next Hop of the route
   to the ingress PE/ASBR. If the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is
   0, then the Ingress PE address is determined from the the received
   Leaf A-D route. If the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is not 0,
   the ABR finds an MVPN I-PMSI/S-PMSI A-D route or VPLS A-D or S-PMSI
   A-D route whose NLRI has the same value as the Route Key field of the
   the Leaf A-D route. The BGP next-hop of this NLRI is the address of
   the ingress PE.  The ABR then advertises this Leaf A-D route to the
   ABRs in the backbone area.

   Mechanisms specific in RFC4684 for constrained BGP route distribution
   can be used along with this specification to ensure that only the
   needed PE/ABR will have to process a said Leaf auto-discovery route.


5.2.1. P2MP RSVP-TE LSP as the Intra-Area P2MP LSP in the Egress Area

   If P2MP RSVP-TE LSP is used as the the intra-area LSP in the egress
   area, then the egress ABR can either (a) graft the leaf (whose IP
   address is specified in the received Leaf auto-discovery route)  into
   an existing P2MP LSP rooted at the egress ABR, and use that LSP for
   carrying traffic for the inter-area segmented P2MP service LSP, or
   (b) originate a new P2MP LSP to be used for carrying (S,G).

   Note that an existing intra-area P2MP LSP may be used solely for that
   particular inter-area P2MP service LSP, or for other inter-area P2MP



Rekhter                                                        [Page 10]

   service LSPs as well. The choice between the two options is purely
   local to the egress ABR. The first option provides one-to-one mapping
   between inter-area P2MP service LSPs and intra-area P2MP LSPs; the
   second option provides many-to-one mapping, thus allowing to
   aggregate forwarding state.

   When the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is not set to zero then
   the ABR MUST re-advertise in the egress area the MVPN/VPLS A-D route,
   that matches the Leaf A-D route to signal the binding of the intra-
   area P2MP RSVP-TE LSP to the inter-area P2MP service LSP. This must
   be done ONLY if a) such a binding hasn't already been advertised or
   b) The binding has changed. The PMSI Tunnel attribute of the re-
   advertised route specifies an intra-area P2MP RSVP-TE LSP rooted at
   the ABR and MUST also carry an upstream assigned MPLS label. The
   upstream-assigned MPLS label MUST be set to implicit NULL if the
   mapping between the inter-area P2MP service LSP and the intra-area
   P2MP LSP is one-to-one. If the mapping is many-to-one the intra-area
   segment of the inter-area P2MP service LSP (referred to as the
   "inner" P2MP LSP) is constructed by nesting the inter-area P2MP
   service LSP in an intra-area P2MP LSP (referred to as the "outer"
   intra-area P2MP LSP), by using P2MP LSP hierarchy based on upstream-
   assigned MPLS labels [RFC 5332].

   If the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is zero, then the egress ABR
   need not advertise any auto-discovery routes. As this is the case of
   inter-area P2MP service LSP being associated with the Internet
   multicast service.  In this case the the egress PEs do not require
   the binding of the intra-area P2MP LSP to the inter-area P2MP service
   LSP. If an egress PE receives multicast packets over an intra-area
   P2MP LSP, with no MPLS label in the stack to identify the inter-area
   P2MP service LSP, the egress PE must forward the packets using its
   internet multicast forwarding table.

   If the mapping between the inter-area P2MP service LSP for Internet
   multicast service and the intra-area P2MP LSP is many-to-one then an
   egress PE must be able to determine whether a given multicast packet
   for a particular (S, G) is received from the "expected" upstream
   PE/ABR. The expected PE/ABR is the PE/ABR to which the Leaf A-D route
   is sent by the egress PE.  Packets received from another PE/ABR for
   that (S, G) MUST be dropped.  To allow the egress PE to determine the
   sender, the intra-area P2MP LSP must be signaled with no PHP, when
   the mapping between the inter-area P2MP service LSP for Internet
   multicast service and the intra-area P2MP LSP is many-to-one.

   This document assumes that a single S-PMSI service LSP carries only a
   single (C-S,C-G). Thus if segments of multiple MVPN or VPLS S-PMSI
   service LSPs are carried over a given intra-area P2MP LSP, each of
   these segments would require a distinct upstream-assigned label, even



Rekhter                                                        [Page 11]


Internet Draft  draft-raggarwa-mpls-seamless-mcast-02.txt  December 2010


   if all these service LSPs are for (C-S, C-G)s from the same
   MVPN/VPLS. Therefore, an ABR maintains an LFIB state for each of the
   (C-S, C-G)s carried over S-PMSIs traversting this ABR (that applies
   to both the ingress and the egress ABRs).

   Note also that the SESSION object that the egress ABR would use for
   the intra-area P2MP LSP need not encode the P2MP FEC from the
   received Leaf auto-discovery route.


5.2.2. P2MP mLDP LSP as the intra-area LSP in the egress area

   If P2MP mLDP LSP is used as the intra-area LSP in the egress area,
   and the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is set to 0 then the egress
   ABR constructs an S-PMSI A-D. The PMSI Tunnel attribute of the route
   contains the identity of the intra-area P2MP LSP. Note that the PMSI
   Tunnel attribute does not carry an upstream assigned label. The RD,
   Multicast Source Length, Multicast Source, Multicast Group Length (1
   octet), and Multicast Group fields of the NLRI of this route are the
   same as of the Leaf A-D route. The egress ABR advertises this route
   into the egress area. The forwarding considerations including the
   determination of whether packets are received from an expected sender
   are the same as the ones above with P2MP RSVP-TE.

   If P2MP mLDP LSP is used as the intra-area LSP in the egress area,
   and the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is not set to 0, ABR MUST
   re-advertise the MVPN/VPLS A-D route, that matches the Leaf A-D route
   to signal the binding of the intra-area P2MP RSVP-TE LSP to the
   inter-area P2MP service LSP. This must be done ONLY if a) such a
   binding hasn't already been advertised or b) The binding has changed.
   The PMSI Tunnel attribute of the re-advertised route specifies an
   intra-area P2MP RSVP-TE LSP rooted at the ABR and MUST also carry an
   upstream assigned MPLS label. The upstream-assigned MPLS label MUST
   be set to implicit NULL if the mapping between the inter-area P2MP
   service LSP and the intra-area P2MP LSP is one-to-one.

   The egress PEs MUST join the intra-area P2MP LDP LSP that is encoded
   in the PMSI Tunnel Attribute of the A-D routes that carry the binding
   of the inter-area P2MP service LSP to the intra-area P2MP LDP LSP.

5.3. Ingress ABR

   When an ingress ABR receives a Leaf auto-discovery route, or a
   withdraw of a previousely received Leaf auto-discovery route from an
   (egress) ABR, and the Route Target extended community carried by the
   route contains the IP address of this ABR, then the following
   procedures will be executed.

   The ingress ABR originates a Leaf A-D route towards the ingress
   PE/ASBR, whose MCAST-VPN-NLRI is constructed using procedures in
   section 4.2 with the difference that the IP based RT contains the
   ingress PE/ASBR address and not the ingress ABR address.


5.3.1. P2MP RSVP-TE LSP as the intra-area LSP in the backbone area

   If the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is not zero, and P2MP RSVP-
   TE LSP is used as the the intra-area LSP in the backbone area, then
   the procedures for binding the backbone area segment of the inter-
   area P2MP LSP to the intra-area P2MP LSP in the backbone area, are
   the same as in section 4.2.1.

   When the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is zero, as is the case
   where the inter-area service P2MP LSP is associated with the Internet
   multicast service, then in addition to the procedures in section
   4.2.1 the ingress ABR MUST originate a S-PMSI A-D route. The PMSI
   Tunnel attribute of the route contains the identity of the intra-area
   P2MP LSP and a distinct upstream assigned MPLS label. The RD,
   Multicast Source Length, Multicast Source, Multicast Group Length (1
   octet), and Multicast Group fields of the NLRI of this route are the
   same as of the Leaf A-D route. The ingress ABR advertises this route
   into the backbone area.


5.3.2. P2MP mLDP LSP as the intra-area LSP in the backbone area

   If the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is not zero, and P2MP mLDP
   LSP is used as the the intra-area LSP in the backbone area, then the
   procedures for binding the backbone area segment of the inter-area
   P2MP LSP to the intra-area P2MP LSP in the backbone area, are the
   same as in section 4.2.2.

   When the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is zero then in addition
   to the procedures in section 4.2.2 the S-PMSI A-D route's PMSI Tunnel
   Attribute MUST carry an upstream assigned MPLS label.

5.4. Ingress PE/ASBR

   When an ingress PE/ASBR receives a Leaf auto-discovery route, or a
   withdraw of a previously received Leaf auto-discovery route, and the
   Route Target extended community carried by the route contains the IP
   address of this PE, then the following procedures will be executed.

   If the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is 0, as is the case when
   the inter-area service P2MP LSP is associated with the Internet
   multicast service, the information carried in the MCAST-VPN NLRI of
   the route MUST be decoded.  The PIM implementation should set its
   upstream (S/RP,G) state machine in Joined state for the (S/RP, G)
   received via a Leaf auto-discovery route.  Likewise, the PIM
   implementation should set its upstream (S/RP, G) state machine in
   Pruned state for the (S/RP, G) received via a Leaf auto-discovery
   route.

   If the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is not 0, the ingress
   PE/ASBR finds an MVPN I-PMSI/S-PMSI A-D route or VPLS A-D or S-PMSI
   A-D route whose NLRI has the same value as the Route Key field of the
   the Leaf A-D route.


5.4.1. P2MP RSVP-TE LSP as the intra-area LSP in the ingress area

   If the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is not zero, and P2MP RSVP-
   TE LSP is used as the the intra-area LSP in the ingress area, then
   the procedures for binding the ingress segment of the inter-area P2MP
   LSP to the intra-area P2MP LSP in the ingress area, are the same as
   in section 4.2.1.

   When the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is zero than in addition
   to the procedures in section 4.2.1 the ingress PE MUST originate a S-
   PMSI A-D route.  The PMSI Tunnel attribute of the route contains the
   identity of the intra-area P2MP LSP and an upstream assigned MPLS
   label. The RD, Multicast Source Length, Multicast Source, Multicast
   Group Length (1 octet), and Multicast Group fields of the NLRI of
   this route are the same as of the Leaf A-D route. The ingress PE
   advertises this route into the ingress area.


5.4.2. P2MP mLDP LSP as the intra-area LSP in the ingress area

   If the RD of the received Leaf A-D route is not zero, and P2MP RSVP-
   TE LSP is used as the the intra-area LSP in the ingress area, then
   the procedures for binding the ingress segment of the inter-area P2MP
   LSP to the intra-area P2MP LSP in the ingress area, are the same as
   in section 4.2.2.



Rekhter                                                        [Page 14]

   Attribute MUST carry an upstream assigned MPLS label.
