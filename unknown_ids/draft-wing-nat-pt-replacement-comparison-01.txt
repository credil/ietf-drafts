Abstract

   As we approach IPv4 address depletion, the IETF must provide for IPv4
   and IPv6 coexistence:  a way for ISPs and enterprises to reduce
   public IPv4 address consumption and a way for hosts to migrate to
   IPv6 connectivity -- while providing reasonable access for those IPv6
   hosts to access the IPv4 Internet.

   This draft compares eight proposals for IPv6 and IPv4 coexistence.

Internet-Draft        NAT-PT Replacement Comparison       September 2008


1.  Terminology

   The following terms are used throughout this document.

   Address Family Translation (AFT):  The function of translating from
        one IP address family (IPv4 or IPv6) to another (IPv6 or IPv4).

   Carrier Grade NAT (CGN):  A NAT device used by many subscribers
        (homes or end sites), where 'many' would be on the order of
        dozens to hundreds of thousands of subscribers.  This might NAT
        between any combination of IPv4 and IPv6.  Typically, the end
        user does not have the ability to adjust the behavior of the CGN
        (i.e., no ability to create static port mapping).

   CPE router:  Customer Premise Equipment router.  A device that
        performs routing functions, located at the customer's premise.
        This device does not perform NAT functions.  (Some referenced
        specifications use the term 'Home GateWay' (HGW) to mean the
        same thing.  We use CPE router because the subscriber might not
        be a business and not a 'home'.)

   DNS rewriting:  The generalized function of synthesizing a DNS AAAA
        response from a DNS A response.  The term "DNS rewriting"
        instead of "DNS-ALG" because in NAT-PT [RFC2766] DNS-ALG meant a
        DNS rewriting function with an interface to the NAT function.

   NAT: Network Address Translation.  This translates IP addresses, one-
        for-one, between two networks, without changing transport
        protocol ports.  The two networks might be IPv4 (NAT44), IPv6
        and IPv4 (NAT64), or IPv4 and IPv6 (NAT46).  This document
        follows (the unfortunate) common usage that "NAT" can also mean
        "NAPT" (Network Address and Port Translator).

   Softwire  A tunnel for carrying IPv4 and IPv6 traffic over IPv6 and
        IPv4 networks [RFC4925].


2.  Introduction

   As the Internet approaches IPv4 address depletion, it will be
   necessary for Internet Service Providers to continue to
   simultaneously provide their users with access to the IPv4 Internet,
   reduce the number of IPv4 public addresses consumed by each
   subscriber, and provide a way for subscribers to migrate to IPv6.

   The proposals have several high-level attributes in common:

Internet-Draft        NAT-PT Replacement Comparison       September 2008


      Provide access to the IPv4 Internet:  There are two approaches to
      provide access to the v4 Internet.  One approach is to have a
      dual-stack host with some modifications from the classic design
      [RFC4213].  The other approach is to have an IPv6-only host and
      operate an address family translation (AFT) device between the
      IPv6-only host and the IPv4 Internet.

      Reduce consumption of global IPv4 addresses:  Network address and
      port translator (NAPT) technology, and NAPT itself, allows more
      than one host to simultaneously use a single IPv4 address.  NAPT
      technology is used in all proposals to conserve IPv4 public
      address space.

      IPv6 migration:  it is important that a migration path for users
      and content providers to move to IPv6 is enabled and encouraged.
      This is necessary because operating a NAT device in order to
      reduce per-subscriber IPv4 address consumption is not a viable
      long-term solution:  we will still exhaust the IPv4 public address
      space, and operating NATs is expensive and reduces the reliability
      of the Internet.

      Port limitations:  All proposals use a NAPT to provide access to
      the IPv4 Internet, which reduces the number of ports each
      subscriber can use.  This has negative impacts on some
      applications (e.g., Apple iTunes, Google Maps).  This problem is
      resolved by the content provider and the subscriber both using
      IPv6.

   This draft is discussed on the [v4v6interm-interest] mailing list.
   Individual proposals are discussed on the mailing list indicated in
   this document.


3.  Overview of Proposals

   This document classifies the proposals into two categories.  The
   first category provides IPv4 and IPv6 access to the subscriber, and
   the second category provides only IPv6 access to the subscriber.  In
   both categories, IPv4 addresses are conserved by using a NAT device.
   This NAT device is placed in the carrier's network ("Carrier Grade
   NAT") or (in the case of APB-Revised) in the CPE router.  In all
   proposals (except NAT444) a host can obtain native IPv6 connectivity
   with native IPv6 hosts without regard to the co-existence proposal.

   The descriptions below provide a very brief overview of each
   proposal, in alphabetical order.

3.1.  IPv4 hosts in Customer Premise

   For Internet access, the following proposals allow for IPv4 hosts in
   the customer premise.

3.1.1.  Address Plus Port (A+P)

   Address Plus Port [A+P] uses a NAT in (or close to) the customer
   premise for access to the IPv4 Internet.  The Service Provider
   conveys both an IPv4 address (as done today) and a range of TCP/UDP
   ports to the NAT.  Outgoing IPv4 traffic is NATted to that range of
   TCP/UDP ports, and the Service Provider routes packets to the
   appropriate customer using both the destination IPv4 address (as done
   today) and destination TCP/UDP port.

   One of A+P's architectures is depicted in Figure 1, where the ISP's
   network supports both IPv4 and IPv6.  In this architecture, the NAT's
   job is straight forward:  it NATs to a limited port range and sends
   the packet upstream to the ISP.  Because multiple customers share a
   single IPv4 address, the aggregation router needs to route return
   packets to the appropriate customer's NAT using destination IPv4 and
   destination port.  This architecture is denoted as "A+P-v4".

        |<private IPv4>NAT<-----------------------------public v4----->

           Figure 1: Address Plus Port, v4-capable ISP (A+P-v4)

   Another of A+P's architectures is depicted in Figure 2, where the
   ISP's network runs only IPv6.  In this architecture, the NAT
   encapsulates the IPv4 packet into an IPv6 packet, where the IPv6
   packet has a source address that corresponds to that NAT, and a
   destination address that corresponds to a well-known prefix which
   routes to a IPv6 tunnel concentrator.  When the packet arrives at the
   IPv6 tunnel concentrator the IPv6 source address is used to construct
   the IPv4 source address and TCP/UDP port, and the IPv6 destination
   address is used to construct the IPv4 destination address; the IPv6
   destination TCP/UDP port is taken from the IPv6 packet's destination
   TCP/UDP header.  This architecture is denoted as "A+P-v6".

             Figure 2: Address Plus Port, v6-only ISP (A+P-v6)

3.1.2.  APB-Revised (APBR)

   APB-Revised (APBR) (no document yet available) shares each IPv4
   address amongst several subscribers through a tunnel aggregation
   device.  APBP was introduced in [I-D.despres-v6ops-apbp] and APB-
   Revised further evolves the concept so that mappings, between IPv6
   addresses and IPv4-address/port-ranges are static.  The static
   mapping avoids the need for the service provider equipment to NAT.

   APBR can be implemented with subscriber site tunnel endpoints either
   in a router (CPE router or other router) or in the APBR host.  In
   both implementations, each subscriber site is assigned a subset of
   public IPv4 address range available to the CGN, typically limited to
   a single address and a restricted port range.  Figure 3 shows the
   APBR architecture in the case where the tunnel is established between
   the CPE router (upgraded to support APBR) and the APB-R-capable
   softwire tunnel concentrator.  Any IPv4 traffic from hosts behind the
   CPE router is NAT'd (using classic NAT44) and forwarded through the
   tunnel to the tunnel endpoint.  The customer premise NATs using the
   external port range it is 'borrowing' from the APBR endpoint.  This
   is abbreviated APBR-CPE in this document.

   This proposal is discussed in [Softwires].

   APBR allows for two implementations for IPv4 access.  Figure 3 shows
   APBR using a CGN (abbreviated APBR-CGN in this document).

              Figure 3: APBPR-CPE, tunnel between CPE and CGN

   In the figure above, the IPv6 tunnel is an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel.

   Figure 4 shows another APBR architecture where the tunnel is
   established directly between the host (upgraded to support APBR) and
   the APBR tunnel endpoint.  Any IPv4 traffic from the APBR host is
   routed through the tunnel to the APB-R-capable softwire tunnel
   concentrator.  Tunnelling is sufficient; no NAT device is needed
   between the host and the public IPv4 network.  This is abbreviated
   APBR-host in this document.  In Figure 4, the customer premise NAT
   does not NAT traffic to/from the APB-R host; however, it does NAT
   traffic to/from the IPv4-only host.

   established between the CPE router and the APBR endpoint, and a
   second tunnel between the subscriber host and the CPE router.  In
   this architecture, the CPE router is upgraded to establish a tunnel
   to the APB-R-capable softwire tunnel concentrator (external side) and
   to accept a tunnel from the host (internal side); the APBR host IP
   stack is upgraded to establish a tunnel to the CPE router.  Any
   traffic from the APBR host is routed by the host's APBR stack and

   forwarded through the tunnel to the CPE router.  Tunnelling is
   sufficient; no NAT device is needed between the host and the core
   IPv4 network.  This is abbreviated APBR-HC (Host and CPE router) in
   this document.

3.1.3.  Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite)

   Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) provides a global IPv4 address that is
   shared amongst several subscribers through a CGN.  Each subscriber
   network is connected to the CGN through a tunnel, using IPv6 as the
   tunnel transport.  All IPv4 traffic is sent inside of that tunnel.
   The tunnel endpoint implements Dual-Stack [RFC4213].  DS-lite is
   currently described in two Internet Drafts,
   [I-D.durand-dual-stack-lite] and [I-D.droms-softwires-snat], and is
   discussed in [Softwires].

   DS-Lite can be implemented with the tunnel endpoints either in a
   router (CPE router or aggregation router) or in a host.  In both
   cases, a single subscriber IPv4 address or IPv4 prefix may overlap,
   or even be identical for all subscribers.  Addresses from overlapping
   address spaces are disambiguated by the tunnels between the
   subscriber networks and the CGN.

   Figure 6 shows the DS-Lite architecture in the case where the tunnel
   is terminated in a router, which could be the CPE router or an
   aggregation router.  In the diagram, the router terminating the
   tunnel is a CPE router, but another router could be used as well
   (e.g., service provider's aggregation router).  In this architecture,
   the router is upgraded to establish a tunnel to the CGN, and does not
   perform any NAT processing on subscriber traffic.  The router
   provides DHCP service (addresses and other configuration information)
   to the subscriber hosts.  This is abbreviated "DS-Lite router" in

3.1.4.  NAT444

   NAT444 (no written proposal) would NAT twice:  first using a NAT

   another NAT device in the ISP's network (a CGN).  This proposal is
   discussed in [Behave].

   This proposal does not provide native IPv6 access to the subscriber,
   but doesn't preclude it if the host or its CPE router wanted to use a
   tunneling solution (e.g., Teredo [RFC4380])

3.2.  IPv6 hosts in Customer Premise

   For access to the IPv4 Internet, the following proposals require IPv6
   hosts in the customer premise, and do not support IPv4 hosts.  These
   proposals provide access to the IPv4 Internet without requiring dual-
   stack on client equipment.

3.2.1.  IVI

   IVI ([I-D.xli-behave-ivi], [I-D.baker-behave-ivi]) uses an address
   and service architecture designed to facilitate transition from an
   IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 Internet.  This service contains three
   parts:  A DNS Application Layer Gateway, a stateful Network Address
   Translator that enables IPv6 clients to initiate connections to IPv4
   servers and peers, and a stateless Network Address Translator that
   enables IPv4 and IPv6 systems to interoperate freely.

   For an IPv6 host needing access to IPv4 hosts, IVI is similar to both
   SIIT [RFC2765] and NAT-PT [RFC2766] but with a different address
   format.  Rather than using the DNS-ALG described in [RFC2766], the
   DNS rewriting function (A to AAAA) is fixed and points to a specific
   IVI gateway, which removes the relationship between the NAT function
   and DNS function.  The DNS server may be in the IVI gateway or in a
   separate system related to it.

   IVI also allows IPv4 hosts to access a IPv6 host, using a stateless
   NAT.  This is accomplished by providing the IPv6 host an IVI address,
   which is simply an IPv6 address from a pool of IPv6 addresses.  This
   pool of IPv6 addresses has a fixed IPv4-to-IPv6 mapping algorithm
   applied to translate between the two address families and the
   translation is implemented by an IVI gateway.  The IPv6 address would
   be advertised in DNS with an A record, pointing to the IVI gateway.
   This allows IPv6-only hosts to have a presence on the IPv4 Internet.
   In this scheme, subsets of the IPv4 addresses are embedded in prefix-
   specific IPv6 addresses and these IPv6 addresses can therefore
   communicate with the global IPv6 networks directly and can

   communicate with the global IPv4 networks via stateless (or almost
   stateless) gateways.  DNS rewriting is not used, or necessary, for
   this fixed mapping of IPv4 addresses to IPv6 address.

   This proposal is discussed in [Behave].

3.2.2.  NAT6

   NAT6 [I-D.jennings-behave-nat6] encourages IPv6 host itself to
   provide necessary DNS rewriting functions (appending a configured
   IPv6 prefix to an IPv4 address to create an IPv6 address) and have
   the NAT function (from IPv6 to IPv4) performed in the network.  By
   having the host provide the DNS rewriting function, a DNS rewriting
   function in the network is avoided.  This proposal is discussed in
   [Behave].

3.2.3.  NAT64

   For an IPv6 host needing access to IPv4 hosts, NAT64
   [I-D.bagnulo-behave-nat64] uses the logic of SIIT [RFC2765] and
   NAT-PT [RFC2766] but with a different address format.  This removes
   the relationship between the NAT function and DNS function.  Rather
   than using the DNS-ALG described in [RFC2766], the DNS service simply
   advertises DNS A and AAAA records specifying the IPv6 address of the

   Note:  the following network architecture is not described in NAT64
   [I-D.bagnulo-behave-nat64], but is included here for completeness.

   It is also possible to utilize NAT64 to access private IPv4 address
   (Figure 12).  This is useful if there are a lot of IPv4 servers and
   it is too difficult or expensive to put each of them on a global IPv4
   address, and it is not possible to upgrade them to IPv6.

   Note that in this scenario, DNS rewriting is not necessary as all of

3.2.4.  NAT-PT

   This section is provided for reference only, because NAT-PT has been

   NAT-PT [RFC2766] provides a combined DNS-ALG and NAT function, which
   share state.  This is typically implemented in a single device.

   with a 1:1 mapping.

              Table 3: IPv4 Hosts Accessing the IPv4 Internet

   The proposals IVI, NAT6, NAT64, NAT-PT, and sNAT-PT are not shown in
   table Table 3 because those proposals provide no support for IPv4-
   only hosts to access the IPv4 Internet.

4.3.  IPv4 Internet Accessing IPv6 hosts

   IVI, NAT-PT, and sNAT-PT all provide mechanisms for IPv4 hosts on the
   Internet to access IPv6-only servers.  Such mappings consume IPv4
   address space.

   IVI:  IVI allows 1:1 mapping from an IPv4 client to an IPv6 server.
   IVI also allows 1:n mappings, by utilizing the TCP/UDP port number of
   the incoming IPv4 packet in the algorithm to determine the
   destination IPv6 host; this conserves IPv4 address space consumption
   for those hosts that need a few TCP/UDP ports available from the IPv4
   Internet.

   NAT-PT:  NAT-PT allows 1:n mapping from an IPv4 client to an IPv6
   server, which is accomplished by dynamically mapping an IPv4 address
   to an IPv6 address after a DNS "A" record query.

   sNAT-PT:  NAT-PT allows 1:1 mapping from an IPv4 client to an IPv6
   server.


5.  Port Forwarding

   Some applications require accepting incoming UDP or TCP traffic.
   When the remote host is on IPv4, the incoming traffic will be
   directed towards an IPv4 address.  The applications are separated
   into two broad categories:  those requiring static incoming ports and
   those requiring dynamic incoming ports.

   Due to IPv4 NATs and IPv4 firewalls, some applications use [UPnP-IGD]
   (e.g., XBox) or ICE [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] (e.g., SIP, Yahoo!/Google/
   Microsoft chat networks), other applications have all but completely
   abandoned incoming connections (e.g., most FTP transfers use passive

Internet-Draft        NAT-PT Replacement Comparison       September 2008


   mode).  But some applications rely on ALGs, UPnP IGD, or manual port
   configuration.  Further discussion in the IETF community is necessary
   to decide how to proceed on this issue.

      Note:  Placing application awareness (i.e., ALG) in the CGN will
      cause bug fixes and new features to be delayed by development,
      testing, and deployment.  To prevent such delays, application
      awareness should be placed elsewhere (e.g., in the CPE router or
      in the end host).

      Note:  Extending NAT-PMP [I-D.cheshire-nat-pmp] to support IPv6
      could provide provide static port forwarding and dynamic port
      forwarding for IPv4 and IPv6 hosts needing access from IPv4 hosts.

5.1.  Static Incoming Ports

   Static incoming ports are used by applications for multiple sessions.

      Note:  Some applications (e.g., BitTorrent) can use UPnP IGD to
      control IPv4 NATs and open a static incoming port.  However,
      technical limitations of UPnP IGD appear to prevent UPnP IGD from
      being directly implemented in a CGN.  The most significant
      technical limitation is that UPnP IGD expects the control point
      (the host) to be able to specify the public port; with hundreds of
      subscribers utilizing the same public IP address, this is
      untenable.  Other UPnP IGD technical limitations may be
      surmountable (e.g., UPnP IGD's ability to create and destroy
      mappings for other IP addresses).

   Examples of applications that require static incoming ports include:

   o  HTTP

   o  SMTP (must be on TCP/25)

   o  ssh

   o  BitTorrent

   o  games (of particular note is that XBox uses UPnP IGD)

   The solutions proposed for static ports are:

      A+P:  The subscriber's customer premise NAT can forward ports
      within the allocated port range.  This port could be advertised by
      the subscriber using DNS SRV resource records or other means.

      APBR-host and APBR-HC:  assign a port in the available port range;
      advertise it with the IPv4 address using a DNS SRV resource
      record.

      Dual-Stack Lite:  none

      NAT444:  none

      IVI:  assign IPv6 IVI address to IPv6 hosts that require incoming
      IPv4 connections

      NAT6:  none

      NAT64:  none

      sNAT-PT:  assign IPv4 address to IPv6 hosts that require incoming
      IPv4 sessions.

5.2.  Dynamic Incoming Ports

   Dynamic incoming ports are, generally, used by applications for a
   single session.  Examples of applications that require dynamic
   incoming ports include:

   o  applications that use real-time transport protocol (RTP)

      *  SIP, RTSP, H.323, MGCP, H.248/Megaco

   o  non-passive FTP client

   o  games (of particular note is that XBox uses UPnP IGD)

   The solutions proposed for dynamic ports are:

      A+P:  An ALG can be incorporated into the subscriber's A+P-aware
      NAT, as done today with subscriber's NAT44 devices.

      APBR-host and APBR-HC:  assign a port in the available port range.

      Dual-Stack Lite:  none

      NAT444:  none (although it is reasonable to expect that ALGs, as
      they exist in today's IPv4 NATs, might be utilized)

      IVI:  assign IPv6 IVI address to IPv6 hosts that require incoming
      IPv4 connections

      NAT6:  none

      NAT64:  applications could be modified to support STUN (for TCP
      and UDP) to learn their public IPv4 address and TCP/UDP port.

      sNAT-PT:  assign IPv4 address to IPv6 hosts that require incoming
      IPv4 connections.


6.  Transport Protocol Support

   [[Placeholder:  discuss how DCCP and SCTP (and other transport
   protocols) are supported by each proposal.  Although existing IPv4
   NATs do not support DCCP or SCTP, it is reasonable to expect that new
   NATs could support those transport protocols if we want those
   protocols to work between address families.

   This section analyzes how each proposal maps to the requirements in
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-nat64-pb-statement-req].

8.  Comparison of Proposals with NAT-PT Problems

   The following sections analyze how proposals fare against the
   problems caused by NAT-PT [RFC2766] as documented in [RFC4966]:

8.1.  Issues Unrelated to an DNS-ALG

8.1.1.  Issues with Protocols Embedding IP Addresses

   NAT6 requires applications to handle NAT6 traversal themselves.

   The other proposals are silent on this issue, but in general using an
   application layer gateway (ALG), in some device in the network,
   appears to be the only solution to this problem.  See also Section 5.

8.1.2.  NAPT-PT Redirection Issues

   All proposals are silent on this issue.

8.1.3.  NAT-PT Binding State Decay

   NAT6 and NAT64 discuss binding lifetimes.

   The other proposals are silent on this issue.

8.1.4.  Loss of Information through Incompatible Semantics

   All proposals are silent on this issue.

8.1.5.  NAT-PT and Fragmentation

   [[NAT64, NAT6, DS-Lite, and IVI all mention fragmentation.  Need to
   analyze how they differ.]]

8.1.6.  NAT-PT Interaction with SCTP and Multihoming

   IVI supports multi-homing if there is a 1:1 mapping between IPv4 and
   IPv6 addresses.  However, 1:1 mapping is not sustainable as we
   approach IPv4 exhaustion.

   APBR (both APBR-host and APBR-HC) support SCTP.

   The other proposals are silent on this issue.  All proposals seem to
   be considering only TCP, UDP, and ICMP.

8.1.7.  NAT-PT as a Proxy Correspondent Node for MIPv6

   All proposals are silent on this issue.

8.1.8.  NAT-PT and Multicast

   IVI can support Source-Specific Multicast [RFC4607] (see Section 7 of
   [I-D.xli-behave-ivi]).

   Dual-Stack Lite does not support multicast.

   NAT6 does not specify how it can work with multicast.

   The other proposals are silent on this issue.

      Note:  it may be possible for IGMP messages to be propagated and

Internet-Draft        NAT-PT Replacement Comparison       September 2008


8.2.  Issues Exacerbated by the Use of DNS-ALG

8.2.1.  Network Topology Constraints Implied by NAT-PT

   The separation of NAT and DNS-rewriting reduces the impact of this
   issue.  IVI, NAT64, and sNAT-PT separate the NAT and DNS-rewrite
   functions, and avoid this constraint.

8.2.2.  Scalability and Single Point of Failure Concerns

   The separation of NAT and DNS-rewriting reduces the impact of this
   issue.  IVI, NAT64, and sNAT-PT all separate the NAT and DNS-rewrite
   functions.

8.2.3.  Issues with Lack of Address Persistence

   TBD.

8.2.4.  DoS Attacks on Memory and Address/Port Pool

   A CGN would only allow a certain subscriber to open a certain number
   of ports, thereby preventing a single subscriber from DoSing other
   subscribers ([I-D.nishitani-cgn], "a CGN SHOULD limit the number of
   the CGN external ports").

8.3.  Issues Directly Related to Use of DNS-ALG

8.3.1.  Address Selection Issues when Communicating with Dual-Stack End-
        Hosts

   Unlike NAT-PT, all proposals that involve DNS-rewriting (IVI, NAT64,
   sNAT-PT) do not return synthetic AAAA records if a real AAAA record
   exists.  This prevents the problem.  A DNS timeout (of the AAAA
   query) will prevent the optimum DNS response from being returned
   (that is, the real AAAA record rather than the synthesized AAAA
   record pointing to the CGN device), but it is still possible to
   connect even when such a timeout occurs.  In practice, such DNS
   timeouts are not a common occurance.

   In [I-D.bagnulo-behave-nat64], EDNS0 [RFC2671] is proposed as the
   mechanism for a host to determine if the AAAA record is synthetic
   (that is, generated by the DNS rewriting function) or if the AAAA
   record is genuine (that is, was not synthesized).

8.3.2.  Non-Global Validity of Translated RR Records

   TBD.

Internet-Draft        NAT-PT Replacement Comparison       September 2008


8.3.3.  Inappropriate Translation of Responses to A Queries

   sNAT-PT avoids this problem with its stateful DNS proxy.

8.3.4.  DNS-ALG and Multi-Addressed Nodes

   The additional NAT binding state is not created if the DNS rewriting
   and NAT functions are separate.  Thus, this problem is avoided by
   [I-D.xli-behave-ivi], [I-D.bagnulo-behave-nat64], and
   [I-D.miyata-v6ops-snatpt].

8.3.5.  Limitations on Deployment of DNS Security Capabilities

   DNSSEC is incompatible with synthesized DNS responses (DNS
   rewriting).

   NAT64 recommends that DNSSEC-capable IPv6-only hosts use the EDNS SAS
   option to ignore synthetic DNS responses.  This would allow the IPv6
   host to ignore synthetic DNS responses and allows DNSSEC to work for
   non- synthesized AAAA responses.  This means, however, that DNSSEC
   only works for native IPv6 AAAA responses, and DNSSEC cannot be used
   for IPv4 A responses.

   No other proposal discusses how it would work with DNSSEC.

   Note:  A proposal that does DNS rewriting only in a validating
   resolver (after validation), or construct records in the
   authoritative server, will work fine with DNSsec.

8.4.  Impact on IPv6 Application Development

   TBD.


9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Address Sharing

   When resources are shared it is important they are shared fairly.  On
   today's Internet, the shared resource is bandwidth -- both the
   service provider's core bandwidth (sharing between subscribers) and
   subscriber access bandwidth (sharing between a subscriber's own
   hosts).  Subscribers are given an IP address(es) for their exclusive
   use.  With all of the NAT44 and NAT64 mechanisms proposed, an IPv4
   address is shared amongst several subscribers.

   This address sharing raises some security considerations, including
   DoS potential (a subscriber might accidentally or purposefully use

Internet-Draft        NAT-PT Replacement Comparison       September 2008


   all available ports, denying ports to other subscribers
   [I-D.nishitani-cgn] and spoofing (a subscriber might send a packet
   with the correct IP address, but the port belongs to a different
   subscriber [A+P].

   For lack of a better identifier, many applications and systems use an
   IPv4 address as an end-host identifier and take action based on that
   identity.  In the past, IP addresses sometimes provided additional
   privileges (e.g., the ability to login without a password using
   Berkeley "r services").  This persists today with some systems (e.g.,
   Sender Policy Framework (SPF)).  Conversely, undesired behavior of a
   certain IP address can cause servers to refuse to provide service.
   For example, excessive connection attempts or excessive downloading
   can cause an HTTP server to delay (or refuse) providing service to
   that IP address.  As another example, IP address blacklisting (e.g.,
   DNSBL) might cause e-mail from that IP address to be considered more
   likely to be spam.  Even with consumer NAT44, these systems work
   reasonably well because excessive connection attempts or spam
   originating from any host belonging to a subscriber is punished,
   without harming other subscribers of that ISP.  (Of course, some such
   systems apply their rate limiting to entire subnets in order to
   purposefully punish other subscribers of that ISP.)  However, when an
   ISP deploys a NAT44 that aggregates many subscribers behind the same
   public IPv4 address, all of those subscribers will be appear as one
   identity to the rest of the Internet.  This will cause problems with
   existing systems that equate an IPv4 address with an identity, and
   take action based on such identities.
