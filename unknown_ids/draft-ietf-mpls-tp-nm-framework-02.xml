	<t>The management of the MPLS-TP network could be based on a multi-tiered distributed management systems, for example as described in <xref target="ITU-T M.3010">ITU-T M.3010</xref> and <xref target="ITU-T M.3060/Y.2401">ITU-T M.3060/Y.2401</xref>. Each tier provides a predefined level of network management capabilities. The lowest tier of this organization model includes the MPLS-TP Network Element that provides the transport service and the Operations System (OS) at the Element Management Level. The Management Application Function (MAF) within the NEs and OSs provides the management support. The MAF at each entity can include agents only, managers only, or both agents and managers. The MAF that include managers are capable of managing an agent included in other MAF.
	</t>

	<t>The management communication to peer NEs and/or Operations Systems (OSs) is provided via the Message Communication Function (MCF) within each entity (e.g. NE and OS). The user can access the management of the MPLS-TP transport network via a Local Craft Terminal (LCT) attached to the NE or via a Work Station (WS) attached to the OS.

		<t>The management of the MPLS-TP network is separable from the management of the other technology-specific networks, and operates independently of any particular client or server layer management plane.
		</t>

		<t>An MPLS-TP Management Network (MT.MN) could be partitioned into MPLS-TP Management SubNetworks ("MT.MSN" or "MPLS-TP MSN", or just "MSN" where usage is unambiguous) for consideration of scalability (e.g. geographic or load balancing) or administrative (e.g. administrative or ownership).
		</t>

		<t>The MPLS-TP MSN could be connected to other parts of the MN through one or more LCTs and/or OSs. The Message Communication Function (MCF) of an MPLS-TP NE initiates/terminates, routes, or otherwise processes management messages over CChs or via an external interface.
		</t>

		<t>Multiple addressable MPLS-TP NEs could be present at a single physical location (i.e. site or office). The inter-site communications link between the MPLS-TP NEs will normally be provided by the CChs. Within a particular site, the NEs could communicate via an intra-site CCh or via a LAN.
		</t>

	</section>

	<section anchor="Element Management Architecture" title="Element Management Architecture">
		<t>The Equipment Management Function (EMF) of a MPLS-TP NE provides the means through which a management system manages the NE.
		</t>

		<t>The EMF interacts with the NE's transport functions by exchanging Management Information (MI) across the Management Point (MP) Reference Points. The EMF may contain a number of functions that provide a data reduction mechanism on the information received across the MP Reference Points.
		</t>

		<t>The EMF includes functions such as Date &amp; Time, FCAPS (Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security) management, and Control Plane functions.  The EMF provides event message processing, data storage and logging. The management Agent, a component of the EMF, converts internal management information (MI signals) into Management Application messages and vice versa. The Agent responds to Management Application messages from the Message Communication Function (MCF) by performing the appropriate operations on (for example) the Managed Objects in a Management Information Base (MIB), as necessary. The MCF contains communications functions related to the outside world of the NE (i.e. Date &amp; Time source, Management Plane, Control Plane, Local Craft Terminal and Local Alarms).
		</t>

		<t>The Date &amp; Time functions keep track of the NE's date/time which is used by the FCAPS management functions to e.g. time stamp event reports.
		</t>

		<t>Below are diagrams that illustrate the components of the Element Management Function (EMF) of a Network Element (NE).  <xref target="high-level_decomposition_of_nef"> The high-level decomposition of the Network Element Function (NEF) picture </xref> provides the breakdown of the NEF, then <xref target="equipment_management_function"> the EMF picture </xref> provides the details of Equipment Management Function, and finally <xref target="message_communication_function"> the Message Communication Function (MCF) picture </xref> details the MCF.

		<t> The <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-req"> MPLS-TP NM requirements</xref> document places no restriction on which management interface is to be used for managing an MPLS-TP network.  It is possible to provision and manage an end-to-end connection across a network where some segments are created/managed/deleted, for example by netconf or snmp and other segments by CORBA interfaces.  Use of any network management interface for one management related purpose does not preclude use of another network management interface for other management related purposes, or the same purpose at another time.

		<xref target="communication_channel_terminology"> the communication channel terminology picture </xref> each technology has its own terminology that is used for the channels that support management and control plane information transfer.  For MPLS-TP, the management plane uses the Management Communication Channel (MCC) and the control plane uses the Signaling Communication Channel (SCC).

<section anchor="Fault Management" title="Fault Management">
	<t>A fault is the inability of a function to perform a required action.  This does not include an inability due to preventive maintenance, lack of external resources, or planned actions.  Fault management provides the mechanisms to detect, verify, isolate, notify, and recover from the fault.
	</t>

	<section anchor="Supervision" title="Supervision">
		<t><xref target="ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701">ITU-T G.7710</xref> lists five basic categories of supervision that provide the functionality necessary to detect, verify, and notify a fault.  The categories are:  Transmission Supervision, Quality of Service Supervision, Processing Supervision, Hardware Supervision, and Environment Supervision.  Each of the categories provides a set of recommendations to ensure the fault management process is fulfilled.
		</t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="Validation" title="Validation">
		<t><xref target="ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701">ITU-T G.7710</xref> describes a fault cause as a limited interruption of the required function.  It is not reasonable for every fault cause to be reported to maintenance personnel.  The validation process is used to turn fault causes (events) into failures (alarms).
		</t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="Alarm Handling" title="Alarm Handling">
		<t>Within an element management system, it is important to consider mechanisms to support severity assignment, alarm reporting control, and logging.
		</t>

	</section>
</section>

<section anchor="Configuration Management" title="Configuration Management">
	<t>Configuration management provides the mechanisms to provision the MPLS-TP services, setup security for the MPLS-TP services and MPLS-TP network elements, and provides the destination for fault notifications and performance parameters.  Inventory reporting is also considered part of configuration management.
	</t>

	<t>Associated with configuration management are hardware and software provisioning and inventory reporting.
	</t>

	<section anchor="LSP ownership handover" title="LSP ownership handover">
		<t>MPLS-TP networks can be managed not only by Network Management Systems (i.e. Management Plane (MP)), but also by Control Plane (CP) protocols.  The utilization of the control plane is not a mandatory requirement (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-requirements">MPLS-TP Requirements</xref>) but it is often used by network operators in order to make network configuration and Label Switched Path (LSP) recovery both faster and simpler.
		</t>

		<t>In networks where both CP and MP are provided, an LSP could be created by either (CP or MP).  The entity creating an LSP owns the data plane resources comprising that LSP.  Only the owner of an LSP is typically able to modify/delete it.  This results in a need for interaction between the MP and CP to allow either to manage all the resources of a network.
		</t>

		<t>Network operators might prefer to have full control of the network resources during the set-up phase and then allow the network to be automatically maintained by the Control Plane. This can be achieved by creating LSPs via the Management Plane and subsequently transferring LSP ownership to the Control Plane. This is referred to as "ownership handover" <xref target="RFC5493">RFC 5493</xref>.  MP to CP ownership handover is then considered a requirement where a Control Plane is in use that supports it.  The converse (CP to MP ownership handover) is a feature that is recommended - but not required - for (G)MPLS networks because it has only minor applications (for example moving LSPs from one path to another as a maintenance operation).
		</t>

		<t>The LSP handover procedure has already been standardized for GMPLS networks, where the signaling protocol used is RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC3209">RFC 3209</xref>. The utilization of RSVP-TE enhancements are defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-pc-spc-rsvpte-ext"></xref>.
		</t>

		<t>MP and CP interworking includes also the exchange of information that is either requested by the MP, or a notification by the CP as a consequence of a request from the MP or an automatic action (for example a failure occurs or an operation is performed). The CP is asked to notify the MP in a reliable manner about the status of the operations it performs and to provide a mechanism to monitor the status of Control Plane objects (e.g. TE Link status, available resources), and to log Control Plane LSP related operations. Logging is one of the most critical aspects because the MP always needs to have an accurate history and status of each LSP and all Data Plane resources involved in it.

<section anchor="Performance Management" title="Performance Management">
	<t>Performance statistics could overwhelm a Management Network, so it is important to provide flexible instrumentation that provides control over the amount of performance data to be collected.  
	</t>

	<t>A distinction is made between performance data that is collected on-demand and data that is collected proactively.  
	</t>
	
	<t>On-demand measurement provides the operator with the ability to do performance measurement for maintenance purpose such as diagnosis or to provide detailed verification of proactive measurement. It is used typically on specific LSP service instances for a limited time, thus limiting its impact on network performance under normal operations. Therefore on demand measurement does not result in scaling issues. 
	</t>
	
	<t>Proactive measurement is used continuously over time after being configured with periodicity and storage information. Data collected from proactive measurement are usually used for verifying the performance of the service.  Proactive performance monitoring has the potential to overwhelm both the process of collecting performance data at a Network Element (for some arbitrary number of service instances traversing the NE), and the process of reporting this information to the OS. As a consequence of these considerations, operators would typically limit the services to which proactive performance measurement would be applied to a very selective subset of the services being provided and would limit the reporting of this information to statistical summaries (as opposed to raw or detailed performance statistics).

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
	<t>Provisions to any of the network mechanisms designed to satisfy the requirements described herein need to prevent their unauthorized use and provide a means for an operator to prevent denial of service attacks if those network mechanisms are used in such an attack.
	</t>
	<t>Solutions need to provide mechanisms to prevent private information from being accessed by unauthorized eavesdropping, or being directly obtained by an unauthenticated network element, system or user.
	</t>
	<t>Performance of diagnostic functions and path characterization involves extracting a significant amount of information about network construction that the network operator considers private.
	</t>
	<t>Section 4.3 of the <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-mpls-and-gmpls-security-framework"> Security Framework for MPLS and GMPLS Networks</xref> document provides a description of the attacks on OAM, and also discusses the background necessary to understand security practices in Internet Service Provider environments.  The security practices described are applicable to MPLS-TP environments.
