Abstract

   This document describes the need for a new pair of IANA Diameter
   Command Codes and a new vendor-specific Application ID to be used in
   a vendor-specific new application, namely for the ITU-T Rec. Q.3303.3
   - Rw interface used to send a request/responses for controlling the
   policy enforcement in a network element, as one of the
   recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union -
   Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T).

1.  Introduction

   This document summarizes the use of Diameter codes in a newly defined
   realization of a specification for controlling the policy
   enforcement.  A new pair of Command Codes and a new vendor-specific
   Application ID are requested to be assigned by IANA.  The document
   summarizes the uses of newly defined Diameter codes (Command Codes,
   AVP, vendor-specific application id).  When combined with the
   Diameter Base protocol, this application's specification [Q.3303.3]
   satisfies the requirements of [Y.2111] of the International
   Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector
   (ITU-T) to send a request and receiving a response for controlling
   the policy enforcement.

   The Diameter realization of this application assumes the use of
   Diameter Base protocol, as per RFC 3588, and extends it only for a
   specific application using a vendor-id (ITU-T), a vendor-specific
   application ID (TBD), a new Command Code (TBD), and new AVPs defined
   in the vendor-specific namespace.

2.  Terminology

   The base Diameter specification [RFC3588] Section 1.4 defines most of
   the terminology used in this document.  Additionally, the terms and
   acronyms defined in Section 4 of [Q.3303.3] are used in this
   document.

3.  Diameter Policy Enforcement Interface ITU-T Rw

   The detailed descriptions of the Diameter Policy Enforcement
   interface ITU-T Rw can be found in Section 5 of the [Q.3303.3].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
   Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC2434].

   This document defines values in the namespaces that have been created
   and defined in the [RFC3588].  The IANA Considerations section of
   that document details the assignment criteria.  Values assigned in
   this document, or by future IANA action, must be coordinated within
   this shared namespace.

4.1.  Application Identifier

   IANA is requested to allocate a vendor-specific application ID for
   the application [Q.3303.3] using the next value from the 16777216-
   4294967294 range.

   Registry:
   ID values            Name           Reference
   ----------------------------------------------
   to be assigned       ITU-T Rw       Section 3

4.2.  Command Codes

   IANA is requested to allocate command code values for the following
   commands defined in Section 7.4 of [Q.3303.3] from the Command Code
   namespace defined in [RFC3588].


   Registry:
   Code Value        Name                          Reference
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   to be assigned    Policy-Install-Request (PIR)  Section 7.4.1
   to be assigned    Policy-Install-Answer  (PIA)  Section 7.4.2

4.3.  AVP Codes

   The values 1010~1018 are assigned by ITU-T to the following AVPs
   within the ITU-T vendor-ID 11502 namespace: PI-Request-Type AVP, PI-
   Request-Number AVP, Traffic-Descriptor-UL AVP, Traffic-Descriptor-DL
   AVP, Maximum-Burst-Size AVP, Committed-Data-Rate AVP, Committed-
   Burst-Size AVP, Excess-Burst-Size, Removal-Cause AVP.

   See Table 1/Q.3303.3 in Section 7.3.1 of [Q.3303.3] for the detailed
   information of AVP codes, value type and flag rules.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the Diameter Policy Enforcement Application.
   It builds on top of the Diameter Base protocol and the same security
   considerations described in [RFC3588] are applicable to this
   document.  No further extensions are required beyond the security
   mechanisms offered by [RFC3588].
