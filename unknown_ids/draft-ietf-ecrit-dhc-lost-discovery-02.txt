Abstract

   civic location information to service contact Uniform Resource

   placement closer to the end host, e.g., in the access network, is
   desireable.  Such a LoST server placement provides benefits in
   disaster situations with intermittent network connectivity regarding
   the resiliency of emergency service communication.

   This document describes how a LoST client can discover a LoST server
   using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

Internet-Draft          DHCP-based LoST Discovery              July 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST)
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost] describes an XML-based protocol for mapping
   service identifiers and geospatial or civic location information to
   service contact Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).

   In order to interact with a LoST server, the LoST client finally
   needs to know its IP address.  Several mechanisms can be used to
   learn this address, including manual configuration.  In environments
   where the access network itself either deploys a LoST server or knows
   a third party that operates a LoST server DHCP can provide the end
   host with a domain name.  This domain name is then used as input to
   the DNS-based resolution mechanism described in LoST
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost] that reuses the URI-enabled NAPTR specification
   (see [RFC4848]).

   This document specifies a DHCPv4 and a DHCPv6 option that allows LoST
   clients to discover local LoST servers.

   Section 2 provides terminology.  Section 4 describes the DHCPv4
   option while Section 5 describes the DHCPv6 option, with the same
   functionality.  IANA and Security Considerations complete the
   document in Section 7 and Section 8.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   Within this document, we use terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-requirements] and [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost].


3.  Domain Name Encoding

   This section describes the encoding of the domain name used in the
   DHCPv4 option shown in Section 4 and also used in the DHCPv6 option
   shown in Section 5.

   The domain name is encoded according to Section 3.1 of RFC 1035
   [RFC1035] whereby each label is represented as a one octet length
   field followed by that number of octets.  The domain name ends with
   the null label of the root, a domain name is terminated by a length
   byte of zero.  The high order two bits of every length octet MUST be

Internet-Draft          DHCP-based LoST Discovery              July 2007


   zero, and the remaining six bits of the length field limit the label
   to 63 octets or less.  To simplify implementations, the total length
   of a domain name (i.e., label octets and label length octets) is
   restricted to 255 octets or less.

   For DHCPv4 only:  If the length of the domain name exceeds the
   maximum permissible within a single option (i.e., 254 octets), then
   the domain name MUST be represented in the DHCP message as specified
   in [RFC3396].


4.  LoST Server DHCPv4 Option

   The LoST server DHCPv4 option carries a DNS (RFC 1035 [RFC1035])
   fully-qualified domain name to be used by the LoST client to locate a
   LoST server.

   The DHCP option for this encoding has the following format:

         Code    Len   LoST Server Domain Name
         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----
         | TBD |  n  |  s1 |  s2 |  s3 |  s4 | s5  |  ...
         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----

                     Figure 1: LoST FQDN DHCPv4 Option


      Code: OPTION_V4_LOST (TBD1)

      Len: Length of the 'LoST Server Domain Name' field
      in octets; variable.

      LoST server Domain Name: The domain name of the LoST
      server for the client to use.

   The encoding of the domain name is described in Section 3.

   Only a single domain name MUST be present in the DHCPv4 option.


5.  LoST Server DHCPv6 Option

   This document defines a DHCPv6 options to carry a domain name.

   The DHCPv6 option has the format shown in Figure 3.

         Figure 3: DHCPv6 Option for LoST Server Domain Name List


      option-code: OPTION_V6_LOST (TBD2)

      option-length: Length of the 'LoST Server Domain Name' field
      in octets; variable.

      LoST server Domain Name: The domain name of the LoST
      server for the client to use.

   A DHCPv6 client MAY request a LoST server domain name in an Options
   Request Option (ORO), as described in [RFC3315].

   A DHCPv4 client MAY request a LoST server domain name in an Parameter
   Request List option, as described in [RFC2131].

   The encoding of the domain name is described in Section 3.

   Only a single domain name MUST be present in the DHCPv6 option.


6.  Example

   This section shows an example of a DHCPv4 option where the DHCP
   server wants to offer the "example.com" domain name to the client as
   input to the U-NAPTR LoST discovery procedure.  This domain name
   would be encoded as follows:


         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
         |TBD|13 | 7 |'e'|'x'|'a'|'m'|'p'|'l'|'e'| 3 |'c'|'o'|'m'| 0 |
         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  IANA Consideration for DHCPv4 Option

   The following DHCPv4 option code for the Location-to-Service
   Translation Protocol (LoST) server option must be assigned by IANA:


       Option  Name            Value       Described in
       -----------------------------------------------
       OPTION_V4_LOST           TBD         Section 4

7.2.  IANA Consideration for DHCPv6 Option

   IANA is requested to assign the following DHCPv6 option codes for the
   Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) options:


       Option  Name            Value       Described in
       ------------------------------------------------
       OPTION_V6_LOST           TBD         Section 5


8.  Security Considerations

   If an adversary manages to modify the response from a DHCP server or
   insert its own response, a LoST client could be led to contact a
   rogue LoST server under the control of the adversary or be given an
   invalid address.  These threats are documented in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-security-threats].  The security considerations in
   [RFC2131], [RFC2132] and [RFC3315] are applicable to this document.
