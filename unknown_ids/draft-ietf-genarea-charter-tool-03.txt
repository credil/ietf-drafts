             Requirements for a Working Group Charter Tool
                   draft-ietf-genarea-charter-tool-03

Abstract

   The IETF intends to provide a new tool to Area Directors for the
   creation, re-chartering, and closing of Working Groups.  The tool
   will also allow the IETF community to view the status of the
   chartering process.  This document describes the requirements for the
   proposed new tool, and it is intended as input to a later activity
   for the design and development of such a tool.

Internet-Draft            WG Charter Tool Reqs              January 2011


1.  Introduction

   [RFC2418] describes the guidelines and procedures for formation and
   operation of IETF Working Groups (WGs).  Since its publication in
   1998, the IETF has started many dozen new WGs, has shut down many
   dozen, and every WG that has had some (often dozens) of changes to
   its charter.

   Currently, virtually all of the tasks associated with creating,
   rechartering, and closing a WG are performed manually.  An Area
   Director (AD) requests one of these actions by manually sending a
   message to the Secretariat's ticket system.  A member of the
   Secretariat staff manually updates the internal Secretariat database
   and the IETF Datatracker, manually places the WG on the IESG
   teleconference agenda (when appropriate), and manually sends out all
   of the required messages and announcements.

   The IAOC would like to create a better tool for those tasks, and this
   document lists the requirements for such a tool.  When complete, this
   document may be used to issue an RFP for the design and development
   of the tool.  This document was prepared at the request of the IAOC.

1.1.  WG Charter Process Overview

   As described in [RFC2418], a key responsibility of the IESG is the
   creation, re-chartering, and closing of WGs.  Creation and
   rechartering of WGs is a multi-step process that involves internal
   review of a draft charter by the IESG and IAB, an external review of
   the draft charter by the IETF community, and (likely) approval of a
   final charter by the IESG.  The internal review by the IESG and IAB,
   and the external review by the IETF community, often result in
   revisions to the draft charter.

   Closing of a WG does not require review or approval by the IESG.
   Rather, a WG may be closed at the request of an AD, (normally the
   Area Advisor for the WG).

1.2.  Discussion of These Requirements

   This document is being discussed on the charter-tool@ietf.org mailing
   list.  See <https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/charter-tool> for
   more information.

   NOTE: This -03 draft will be followed soon by a -04 draft with many
   changes to the state machine, based on the current procedures used by
   the IESG and IETF Secretariat.

2.  Tool Requirements

   The tool described here holds records for new WGs that are being
   considered as well as for all WGs whose charter are under review.

2.1.  Requirement: Creating a new WG record

   Any AD can create a new WG record with a proposed charter using a
   simple web form.  Creating a record should succeed as long as there
   is no other WG with the same name.  The AD who creates the record
   becomes the initial shepherding AD.

   The shepherding AD of an existing WG can create a new record in the
   tool when a WG's charter is expected to change or when that AD agrees
   to sponsor a BoF.

2.2.  Requirement: Modifying an existing WG record

   Any AD can modify an existing WG record.  These modifications include
   (at a minimum) changes to the charter text, to the name of of the
   shepherding AD, to the suggested WG chairs, to the applicable Area,
   to the name of the WG, to the WG's abbreviation, and to the location
   of the mailing list.  The AD must be also able to include a pointer
   to an older location for the mailing list.

2.3.  Requirement: Moving a charter through all steps in the review
      process

   Any AD can directly change the state of a WG record to any of the
   following states:

   o  Internal IESG review -- This causes a message to be sent to all
      IESG members.

   o  Scheduled for IESG teleconference -- This causes an item to be
      added to the teleconference agenda.

   o  In IETF review -- This causes a message to be sent to the
      Secretariat, who can then send a message to ietf-announce@ietf.org
      and start a timer for remind the sponsoring AD when the review
      completes.

   In addition, any AD should be able to easily send a message to the
   Secretariat to tell the new-work@ietf.org mailing list about the
   proposed WG.

Internet-Draft            WG Charter Tool Reqs              January 2011


2.4.  Requirement: Adding comments

   Every AD can add a comment to the record of a WG that is under
   review.  Each comment can be flagged as private, meaning that it is
   only to be viewed by the IESG and IETF Secretariat.  Also, each
   comment can be flagged as either "discuss" (meaning blocking forward
   movement until it is resolved) and "regular" (meaning that it is non-
   blocking but informative).

2.5.  Requirement: Requesting the closing of a WG

   A shepherding AD can request the Secretariat to close an existing WG.
   The shepherding AD of an existing WG can create a new record in the
   tool when the WG is expected to shut down.  The request action will
   prompt the AD to provide instructions regarding the disposition of
   any active Internet-Drafts (withdraw them or convert them to
   individual submissions), and the status of the WG mailing list (will
   it remain open or should it be closed).

2.6.  Requirement: Wording of announcements

   The shepherding AD can view and edit all of the standard "WG Review"
   and "WG Action" announcements before they are sent out during the WG
   creation, rechartering, and closing processes.

2.7.  Requirement: Access by the IETF Secretariat and IETF Chair

   The IETF Secretariat, and the IETF Chair, can perform all actions
   that can be performed by any AD in this tool.

2.8.  Requirement: Seeing differences between versions of pre-approval
      wordings

   It needs to be easy to compare differences between different versions
   of proposed charter language and milestones, up to and including the
   approved version.  When a WG is being rechartered, it needs to be
   easy to compare differences between different versions of proposed
   charter language and milestones, including with the existing charter.

   It also must be easy to compare the milestones in a proposed charter
   to the current milestones of a WG.

2.9.  Requirement: Showing some information only to ADs and the
      Secretariat

   Some information, such as private comments, will be viewable only by
   ADs and the IESG Secretariat.  Some information might be private for
   some charters but public for others; for example, some ADs have made

Internet-Draft            WG Charter Tool Reqs              January 2011


   their choices for potential WG chairs public in some BoF charters.

2.10.  Requirement: Viewing and searching the charter database

   All members of the IETF community can view the public portions of the
   charter database.  They can also search for a WG record in the tool
   based on one or more of the following criteria:

   o  WG name (full or partial)

   o  WG acronym

   o  WG charter state

   o  Shepherding AD

   o  Area

   o  Text in any of the fields

   Further, all users can view all snapshots of earlier versions of a
   WG's charter.  Snapshots include the Area, AD, WG name, WG acronym,
   chairs, charter text, and milestones

2.11.  Requirement: Initializing the tool

   Records for all WGs that are being created, or are in the process of
   charter updates, will be added before the tool is first publicly
   deployed.

   The database should also be initialized with historical data, namely
   as much information as is currently known about closed WGs.


3.  IANA Considerations

   None.


4.  Security Considerations

   Creating a new tool for tracking the charter of WGs does not affect
   the security of the Internet in any significant fashion.


5.  Acknowledgements

   This document draws heavily on, including wholesale copying from,

   earlier work done on this topic by other writers.  They will be
   acknowledged by name in a future version of this document if their
   identities are ascertained.

   Various members of the IESG contributed many suggestions to this
   document.  In particular David Harrington, Robert Sparks, and Russ
   Housley contributed a great deal of wording and many ideas.


6.  Normative References

              Procedures", BCP 25, RFC 2418, September 1998.


Appendix A.  Some Known Open Issues

   Given the very early stage of this document, there are actually many
   more open issues than are listed here.  This list is mostly meant to
   remind the author of topics that need to be updated in future
   versions of the document, and to spur readers to think of even more
   open issues.

   o  There needs to be a section on access control for ADs and
      Secretariat staff.

   o  It is not yet clear whether the tool will have its own database or
      use the current Datatracker database.

   o  There needs to be a requirement about Atom feeds for the charters.

   o  What lists other than ietf-announce need to be told of external
      review?


Appendix B.  Differences between -02 and -03

   In 1, removed the "very early draft" note.

   In 2.1, simplified the charter creation step.

   In 2.1, added "or when that AD agrees to sponsor a BoF" to indicate
   that an AD can start tracking even at the pre-BoF stage.

   In 2.2, changed the requirement for modifying the record from
   shepherding AD to any AD.

   In 2.2, added ability to change a WG's name and abbreviation, and

   also information about the mailing list.

   In 2.2, changed the requirement for moving the steps from shepherding
   AD to any AD.

   In 2.3, change the automatic sending of mail to be to the
   Secretariat.

   In 2.3, added the requirement that the shepherd needs to be able to
   ask the Secretariat to alert the new-work mailing list.

   In 2.4, added the "discuss" and "regular" flagging for comments.

   In 2.8, added the second paragraph about being able to compare
   milestones.

   In 2.10, added that searching includes text in any field and
   clarified what is in a snapshot.

   In 2.11, added that closed WGs should be in the database as well.
