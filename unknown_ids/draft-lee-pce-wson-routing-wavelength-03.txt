Abstract 

   This memo provides application-specific requirements and protocol 
   enhancements for the Path Computation Element communication Protocol 
   (PCEP) for the support of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks 
   (WSON).  Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a routing and 
   wavelength assignment (RWA) process.  From a path computation 
   perspective, wavelength assignment is the process of determining 
   which wavelength can be used on each hop of a path and forms an 
   additional routing constraint to optical light path computation. 
   Different computational architectures for the RWA process are given 
   and the PCEP extensions needed to support these architectures are 
   defined.

1. Introduction 

   [RFC4655] defines the PCE based Architecture and explains how a Path 
   Computation Element (PCE) may compute Label Switched Paths (LSP) in 
   Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and 
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks at the request of Path Computation 
   Clients (PCCs).  A PCC is shown to be any network component that 
   makes such a request and may be for instance an Optical Switching 
   Element within a Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) network.  The 
   PCE, itself, can be located anywhere within the network, and may be 
   within an optical switching element, a Network Management System 
   (NMS) or Operational Support System (OSS), or may be an independent 
   network server. 

   The PCE communications Protocol (PCEP) is the communication protocol 
   used between PCC and PCE, and may also be used between cooperating 
   PCEs.  [RFC4657] sets out the common protocol requirements for PCEP.  
   Additional application-specific requirements for PCEP are deferred to 
   separate documents. 

   This document provides a set of application-specific PCEP 
   requirements and protocol enhancements for support of path 
   computation in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON).  WSON 
   refers to WDM based optical networks in which switching is performed 
   selectively based on the wavelength of an optical signal.   

   The path in WSON is referred to as a lightpath.  A lightpath may span 
   multiple fiber links and the path should be assigned a wavelength for 
   each link.  A transparent optical network is made up of optical 
   devices that can switch but not convert from one wavelength to

   another. In a transparent optical network, a lightpath operates on 
   the same wavelength across all fiber links that it traverses. In such 
   case, the lightpath is said to satisfy the wavelength-continuity 
   constraint. Two lightpaths that share a common fiber link can not be 
   assigned the same wavelength.  To do otherwise would result in both 
   signals interfering with each other. Note that advanced additional 
   multiplexing techniques such as polarization based multiplexing are 
   not addressed in this document since the physical layer aspects are 
   not currently standardized. Therefore, assigning the proper 
   wavelength on a lightpath is an essential requirement in the optical 
   path computation process.   

   On the other hand, when a switching node has the ability to perform 
   wavelength conversion the wavelength-continuity constraint can be 
   relaxed, and a lightpath may use different wavelengths on different 
   links along its route from origin to destination. It is, however, to 
   be noted that wavelength converters may be limited due to their 
   relatively high cost, while the number of WDM channels that can be 
   supported in a fiber is also limited. As a WSON can be composed of 
   network nodes that cannot perform wavelength conversion, nodes with 
   limited wavelength conversion, and nodes with full wavelength 
   conversion abilities, wavelength assignment is an additional routing 
   constraint to be considered in all lightpath computation.  

   Optical impairment constraints are not addressed in this document as 
   the current scope of the WSON framework [WSON-FRAME] does not include 
   them.  

   The remainder of this document uses terminology from [RFC4655].  

    

2. Background: RWA Computation Architectures 

   The WSON framework [WSON-FRAME] document defines the following RWA 
   computation architectures.  

   o  Combined RWA --- Both routing and wavelength assignment are 
      performed at a single computational entity.  This choice assumes 
      that computational entity has sufficient WSON network link/nodal 
      and topology information to be able to compute RWA. 

   o  Separate Routing and WA --- Separate entities perform routing and 
      wavelength assignment.  The path(s) obtained from the routing 
      computational entity must be furnished to the entity performing 
      wavelength assignment.

Internet-Draft         PCEP Extension for WSON             October 2008 
    

   o  Routing with Distributed WA --- Routing is performed at a 
      computational entity while wavelength assignment is performed in a 
      distributed fashion across the nodes along the path. 

 
   For the Combined RWA architecture, there are two possible computing 
   entities: (i) the NE is the computational entity -- in this case, 
   there is no separate PCE as the NE assumes PCE function; (ii) a 
   separate PCE is the computational entity.  This document is only 
   concerned with case (ii). In this case, the PCE should perform both 
   routing (R) and wavelength assignment (WA) upon request of the PCC. 

   For the Separate Routing and Wavelength architecture, there can be 
   two variations: 

 
   o  A separate PCE will perform only wavelength assignment (WA) while 
      the NE performs the route calculation based on its local 
      knowledge. In this case, the NE should furnish the route list to 
      the PCE so that the PCE would be able to assign wavelength to the 
      route. 

   o  One PCE performs the routing (R) function while another PCE 
      performs the Wavelength Assignment (WA) function in a tandem 
      fashion.  The fact that two PCEs are involved (one for Routing and 
      one for Wavelength Assignment (WA)) could be invisible to the 
      original PCC. 

   For the Routing with Distributed WA architecture, the PCE is only 
   responsible for routing (i.e., path computation), not for exact 
   wavelength assignment. The exact assignment of wavelengths would be 
   performed at the NEs along the path in a distributed fashion. 

3. PCECP Requirements 

   This section provides the PCECP requirements to support WSON routing 
   and wavelength assignment (RWA) applications.  The requirements 
   specified in this section are detailed requirements based on high-
   level specification in [WSON-FRAME]. 

    

   3.1. RWA Computation Options 

   The following RWA computation options should be conveyed in the PC 
   Request:  

 
 
Lee & Bernstein         Expires April 27, 2009                 [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft         PCEP Extension for WSON             October 2008 
    

    

   o  The request is for both Routing and Wavelength Assignment (R+WA). 
      This case may arise when the NE is not capable of either route 
      calculation or wavelength assignment at the node level, or when a 
      more optimal RWA is desired.  

   o  The request is for Routing (R) only.  This case may arise when the 
      NE is not capable of route calculation at the node level while 
      wavelength assignment is done at the node level in a distributed 
      fashion. 

   o  The request is for Wavelength Assignment (WA) only.  This case may 
      arise when the NE is capable of route calculation at the node 
      level (e.g., via an IGP-TE) but with no wavelength information      
      is available at the node level, or when two PCEs work in tandem 
      with one performing the routing (R) function and another 
      wavelength assignment (WA).  In either case, the calculated route 
      list at one computing entity should be supplied in the request 
      message to the other computing entity where WA is applied. 

 
   The corresponding PC Reply message should include the following 
   information: 

   o  An indicator that conveys the original request was for (i) Both 
      Routing and Wavelength Assignment (R+WA); (ii) Wavelength 
      Assignment (WA) only; (iii) Routing (R) only.  

   o  The route list for all cases above and the recommended wavelengths 
      to be used for the route for cases (i) and (ii).  

   o  In the case of failure to find a proper route or wavelengths 
      assigned to the route, proper reasons for the failure should be 
      conveyed: (i) route not found; (ii) wavelength not found (i.e., 
      wavelength blocking); (iii) both route and wavelength not found. 

 

   3.2. Same Wavelength Assignment for Primary and backup paths 

   The PC Request should indicate if the same wavelength assignment for 
   the primary and backup paths is required or not.  

   o  Same wavelength required 

   o  Different wavelength required

Internet-Draft         PCEP Extension for WSON             October 2008 
    

    

   3.3. Same Wavelength Assignment for Bidirectional LSP 

   When Bidirectional LSP is requested in the PC Request Message, a 
   further indication should be made if the same wavelength should be 
   assigned in both directions in each hop. Note that assigning 
   different wavelengths for the two directions is assumed as default.  

   o  Same wavelengths required 

   o  Different wavelengths permitted  

    

   3.4. Wavelength Assignment in PC Reply 

   If the original request is either for both Routing and Wavelength 
   Assignment (R+WA) or for Wavelength Assignment (WA) only, the exact 
   wavelength assignment result should be conveyed to the PCC using the 
   ERO object and ERO Label subobject within the ERO. Note that this 
   requirement is fulfilled by the Label Set mechanism in [RFC3471]. 

 

   3.5. RWA objective functions 

   Analogous to [PCE-OF], the RWA computation should support a number of 
   objective functions in the PC Request Message. The following RWA 
   objective functions should be supported at a minimum: 

       o  For a sequential request (i.e., one request): 

            . TBD 

       o  For a concurrent request (i.e., multi-commodity flows):  

            . Minimize the total number of link-wavelength used 

            . Minimize the maximum link-wavelength used (load balance)  

            . Minimize the path length of all flows 

   The PCRep should indicate which objective function has actually been 
   applied.

   3.6. Timeliness Characteristics of Lightpath 

   The request MAY indicate the specific timeliness of the computation 
   request for a lightpath. This will likely be related to the use to 
   which the lightpath will be put: 

   o  Time Critical: this type of request is useful for those lightpath 
      establishment requests used for restoration of service or other 
      high priority real time services. 

   o  Soft Time Bounds: this type of request is a more typical new 
      connection request.  While expected to be responsive, there should 
      be more time to take into account network optimization. 

   o  Scheduled: this type of request is useful when the requested 
      lightpath connections are not time critical (i.e., the request is 
      significantly ahead of their intended "in-service" time.  It is to 
      be noted that we will not explicitly deal with scheduled case in 
      this document but the optimization can be handled via [PCE-GCO]. 

   The reply should indicate the original timeliness characteristics of 
   the lightpath request with path computation results.  

    

   3.7. Duration of Lightpath 

   The request MAY indicate specific lightpath duration information 
   associated with the request. This may be useful to the PCE since it 
   is not worthwhile to optimize lightpaths with relatively short 
   duration as compared to pseudo-static paths.   

 
 
 
4. Protocol Extensions for Support of WSON RWA 

   This section describes PCEP extension necessary to meet the 
   requirements set out in the previous section. 

   4.1. RWA Computation Options 

   The PCC has to include the RWA computation option in the PCReq 
   message in order to convey a particular computation option.  To 
   support such indication a new flag, the RWA Computation (RC) flag, is 
   defined in the RP (Request Parameter) Object.   
 
 
Lee & Bernstein         Expires April 27, 2009                 [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft         PCEP Extension for WSON             October 2008 
    

 
   The RC flag is defined in the Flags field of the RP (Request 
   Parameter) object as follows. Bit number assignment to be confirmed 
   by IANA (see Section 8).

   10-11   RC-bits Routing Wavelength Computation       This document 
 
 
   RC bits (Routing wavelength Computation bits - 2 bits): 

   o  11: Request is for both R (Routing) and Wavelength Assignment 
      (WA). 

   o  01: Request is for Wavelength Assignment (WA) only. 

   o  10: Request is for Routing (R) only.  

   When the RC bits are set to 11 in a PCReq message, the requesting PCC 
   requires the PCE to provide in the PCRep message the assigned 
   wavelength associated with the computed path.  This request is for 
   both Routing (R) and Wavelength Assignment (WA). 

   When the RC bits are set to 01 in a PCReq message, the requesting PCC 
   requires the PCE only to provide wavelength assignment (WA).  In such 
   case, the PCC must provide the already computed route (as indicated 
   by the ERO and the Bandwidth Object following the RP object) to which 
   the PCE would assign the wavelengths.  Note that this option is to 
   fulfill one of the RWA computational architectures, namely, the 
   Separate Routing and WA option. 

   When the RC bits are set to 11 or 01, then additional parameters 
   associated with the requested lightpath SHOULD be provided in 
   optional Lightpath Specific Parameter TLV (as specified in Section 
   3.4) within the RP object. See Section 4.2 for the encoding of 
   Lightpath Specific Parameter TLV. 

   The RP object in the PCRep message SHOULD properly indicate the 
   original request for the RWA Computation (RC) bit that has actually 
   been applied by the PCE. The actual route list and wavelength 
   assignment is to be found in the ERO within ERO Label subobjects. ERO 
   Label subobjects can be used to indicate the wavelength to be used on 
   particular links. Note that GMPLS signaling [RFC3473] supports an 
   explicit route object (ERO) and with ERO Label subobjects.

   When the RC bit is set to 11 or 01 and the B bit is set to 1 (which 
   indicates a bi-directional LSP request) in the RP object in a PCReq 
   message, then the following Lightpath Specific Parameter TLV SHOULD

   4.4. Error Indicator 

   To indicate errors associated with the RWA request, a new Error-Type 
   (15) and subsequent error-values are defined as follows for inclusion 
   in the PCEP-ERROR object. 

   If a PCE receives a RWA computation request and the PCE is not 
   capable of RWA, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with a PCEP ERROR 
   object (Error-Type=15) and an Error-Value (Error-Value=1).  The 
   corresponding RWA computation request MUST be cancelled. 

   To indicate an error associated with policy violation, a new error 
   value "RWA not allowed" is added to the existing error code for 
   policy violation (Error-Type=6) as defined in [PCEP]. 

   If a PCE receives a RWA computation request which is not compliant 
   with administrative privileges (i.e., the PCE policy does not support 
   RWA), the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR Object 
   (Error-Type=6) and an Error-Value (Error-Value=3).  The corresponding 
   RWA computation MUST be cancelled. 

   4.5. NO-PATH Indicator  

   To communicate the reason(s) for not being able to find RWA 
   computation, the NO-PATH object MAY be used in the PCRep message. The 
   NO-PATH object is defined in [PCEP].  

   As defined in [PCEP], the NO-PATH object carries the NO-PATH_VECTOR 
   TLV which has a flags field. One new bit flag is defined in this 
   document to indicate RWA-specific computation failures as follows:    

   0x10: when set, the PCE indicates that no wavelength was found 
   associated with RWA computation in the PCRep message. 

    

5. Manageability Considerations 

   Manageability of WSON Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) with 
   PCE must address the following considerations: 

   5.1. Control of Function and Policy 

   In addition to the parameters already listed in Section 8.1 of 
   [PCEP], a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring the following 
   PCEP session parameters on a PCC:

   o  The ability to send a WSON RWA request. 

   In addition to the parameters already listed in Section 8.1 of 
   [PCEP], a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring the following 
   PCEP session parameters on a PCE: 

   o  The support for WSON RWA. 

   o  The maximum number of synchronized path requests associated with 
      WSON RWA per request message. 

   o  A set of WSON RWA specific policies (authorized sender, request 
      rate limiter, etc). 

 
   These parameters may be configured as default parameters for any PCEP 
   session the PCEP speaker participates in, or may apply to a specific 
   session with a given PCEP peer or a specific group of sessions with a 
   specific group of PCEP peers. 

 
   5.2. Information and Data Models, e.g. MIB module 

   Extensions to the PCEP MIB module defined in [PCEP-MIB] should be 
   defined, so as to cover the WSON RWA information introduced in this 
   document. A future revision of this document will list the 
   information that should be added to the MIB module. 

   5.3. Liveness Detection and Monitoring 

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness 
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already 
   listed in section 8.3 of [PCEP]. 

 
   5.4. Verifying Correct Operation 

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new verification 
   requirements in addition to those already listed in section 8.4 of 
   [PCEP] 

 
   5.5. Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components 

   The PCE Discovery mechanisms ([ISIS PCED] and [OSPF PCED]) may be 
   used to advertise WSON RWA path computation capabilities to PCCs.

   5.6. Impact on Network Operation 

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new network 
   operation requirements in addition to those already listed in section 
   8.6 of [PCEP]. 

    

6. Security Considerations 

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models 
   within PCEP [PCEP]. However the additional information distributed in 
   order to address the RWA problem represents a disclosure of network 
   capabilities that an operator may wish to keep private. Consideration 
   should be given to securing this information.   

    

7. IANA Considerations 

   A future revision of this document will present requests to IANA for 
   codepoint allocation.
