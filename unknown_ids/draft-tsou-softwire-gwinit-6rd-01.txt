                   draft-tsou-softwire-gwinit-6rd-01

Abstract

   This document proposes an alternative 6rd deployment model to that of
   RFC 5969.  The basic 6rd model allows IPv6 hosts to gain access to
   IPv6 networks across an IPv4 access network using 6-in-4 tunnels. 6rd
   requires support by a device (the 6rd-CE) on the customer site, which
   must also be assigned an IPv4 address.  The alternative model
   described in this document initiates the 6-in-4 tunnels from an
   operator-owned gateway collocated with the operator's IPv4 network
   edge, rather than from customer equipment.  The advantages of this
   approach are that it requires no modification to customer equipment
   and avoids assignment of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment.  The
   latter point means less pressure on IPv4 addresses in a high-growth
   environment, as well as smaller IPv4 routing tables.

Internet-Draft           "Gateway-Initiated" 6rd            October 2010


1.  Introduction

   6rd [RFC5969] provides a transition tool for connecting IPv6 devices
   across an IPv4 network to an IPv6 network, at which point the packets
   can be routed natively.  The network topology is shown in Figure 1.

      |              |     |                 |      |         |

   +-----+        +-----+  |            +--------+  |         |
      | Customer LAN |     |                 |      |         |
      +--------------+     +-----------------+      +---------+

                     Figure 1: 6rd Deployment Topology

   In Figure 1, the CE is the customer edge router.  It is provisioned
   with a delegated IPv6 prefix, but also with an IPv4 address so that
   it is reachable through the IPv4 network.  As a consequence, the
   routers in the IPv4 network have to carry a route for every customer
   site.  In a large network, this can lead to very large routing
   tables.  Further, the need to provision an IPv4 address for every 6rd
   user will aggravate the pressure due to IPv4 address shortage for
   operators faced with a high rate of growth in the number of broadband
   subscribers to their network.


2.  Problem Statement

   Consider an operator facing a high subscriber growth rate.  As a
   result of this growth rate, the operator faces pressure on its stock
   of available public IPv4 addresses.  For this reason, the operator is
   motivated to offer IPv6 access as quickly as possible.

   The backbone network will be the first part of the operator's network
   to support IPv6.  The metro network is not so easily upgraded to
   support IPv6 since many devices need to be modified and there may be
   some impact to existing services.  Thus any means of providing IPv6
   access has to minimize the changes required to devices in the metro
   network.

   In contrast to the situation described for basic 6rd [RFC5569], the
   operator is assumed to be unable to manage IP devices on the customer
   premises.  As a result, the operator cannot assume that any of these
   devices are capable of supporting 6rd.

   If the customer equipment is in bridged mode and IPv6 is deployed to

   sites via a Service Provider's (SP's) IPv4 network, the IPv6-only
   host needs a IPv6 address to visit the IPv6 service.  In this
   scenario, 6to4 or 6RD can be used.  However, each IPv6-only host may
   need one corresponding IPv4 address when using 6to4 or 6RD, which
   brings great address pressure to the operators.

   If the customer equipment is in routing mode, the operator has an
   opportunity to avoid assigning IPv4 addresses to sites running IPv6
   only.  Some other means is available for routing IPv6 traffic through
   the IPv4 network to that site.


3.  Proposed Solution

   For basic 6rd, the 6rd-CE described in [RFC5969] initiates the 6-in-4
   tunnel to the Border Router to carry its IPv6 traffic.  To avoid the
   requirement for customer premises equipment to fulfill this role, it
   is necessary to move the tunneling function to a network device.
   This document identifies a functional element termed the Gateway to
   perform this task.  The functions of the Gateway are:

   o  to encapsulate outgoing IPv6 packets in an IPv4 tunnel to a Border
      Router, whence it is decapsulated and forwarded to an IPv6 network
      as for 6rd.

   o  to decapsulate incoming IPv6 packets and forward them to the
      correct user site.

   In the proposed solution, there is only one tunnel initiated from
   each Gateway to the Border Router which greatly reduces the number of
   tunnels the Border Router has to handle.  The deployment scenario
   consistent with the problem statement in Section 2 collocates the
   Gateway with the IP edge of the access network.  This is shown in
   Figure 2, and is the typical placement of the Broadband Network
   Gateway (BNG) in a fixed broadband network.  By assumption, the metro
   network beyond the BNG is IPv4.  Transport between the customer site
   and the Gateway is over layer 2.

   The elements of the proposed solution are these:

   o  The IPv6 prefix assigned to the customer site contains the IPv4
      address of the network-facing side of the Gateway.

   o  The Border Router is able to route incoming IPv6 packets to the
      correct Gateway by extracting the Gateway's address from the IPv6
      destination address before encapsulating the packet.

   o  The Gateway can route incoming IPv6 packets to the correct link
      based on the IPv6 destination address of the decapsulated packet.

   Incidental to this, the Gateway serves as an IPv4 aggregation point
   for all of the pure IPv6 customer sites it serves.

3.1.  Prefix Delegation

   Referring back to Figure 2, prefix assignment to the customer
   equipment occurs in the normal fashion through the Gateway/IP edge,
   using either PPPoEv6 or DHCPv6 or SLAAC.  In the spirit of 6rd, the
   prefixes contain the 32-bit IPv4 address assigned to the gateway.  An
   example format (derived from the IPv6 unicast address structure
   [RFC3587]) is shown in Figure 3.

   +----------------------------------------------------------+
   |001 | Global IPv6    | Subnet | Indic | IPv4 addr |  Host |
   |    | routing prefix |        |       |           |   ID  |
   +----+----------------+--------+-------+-----------+-------+
   | 3  |    45 bits     |16 bits | N bits|  32 bits  | 32 - N|
   +----------------------------------------------------------+

             Figure 3: Suggested Customer Site Address Format

   The first 64 bits in Figure 3 are as defined in [RFC3587].  The N-bit
   Indicator field which comes next is defined for operator use.  The
   operator will assign a specific indicator value to designate the
   customer site address format which includes the IPv4 address of the
   Gateway/IP edge.  Other indicator values could be used to designate
   alternative address formats.  The indicator field is followed by the
   32-bit IP address of the Gateway/IP edge (e.g., the BNG) and then by
   a host identifier that uses the remaining 32 - N bits.

   If the length of the prefix delegated to the customer site is a
   concern, one could use the format shown in [RFC5969].  However, this
   requires a much-shortened global IPv6 routing prefix, and hence a
   much higher degree of IPv6 route aggregation.  That may or may not be
   practical for a given operator.

   With the present proposal, there is no concern about DHCPv6 lease
   times.  The Gateway/IP edge will be assigned a permanent IPv4
   address, using the operator's normal network provisioning processes.

3.2.  Troubleshooting and Traceability

   The first paragraph of Section 5 of [RFC5969] on traceability applies
   equally well to the present proposal.  The second paragraph, on
   support of anycast addressing, applies with the substitution of the
   Gateway for the 6rd CE, and use of the Gateway's assigned IPv4
   address to derive the virtual interface address.

3.3.  Address Selection

   No change from [RFC5969].

3.4.  Gateway-Initiated 6rd Configuration

   The Gateway/IP edge rather than the 6rd CE is configured with the
   IPv4MaskLen, 6rdPrefix, 6rdPrefixLen, and 6rdBRIPv4Address.

   The IPv4MaskLen is redefined to be the number of high-order bits that
   are identical across all IPv4 addresses assigned to network nodes in
   the IPv4 network.

   No special configuration of customer equipment, in particular,
   customer edge routers, is required.  Hence the 6rd DHCPv4 option is
   inapplicable.

   Border Relay configuration is unchanged, except if using an
   alternative address format to that defined in [RFC5969].

   The discussion of Neighbour Unreachability Detection in [RFC5969] is
   inapplicable.

   The considerations on IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation in Section 9 of
   [RFC5969] apply with the substitution of the Gateway/IP edge for the
   CE.

3.5.  Transition Considerations

   No change from [RFC5969].  This technique can co-exist with dual-
   stack operation at the customer site, assuming that the Gateway is
   configured as the default outgoing gateway for IPv6 traffic.

3.6.  IPv6 Address Space Usage

   If the 6rd address format is used, there is no change from Section 11
   of [RFC5969].  If the address format follows the example given in
   Figure 3, the address space usage for 6rd is the same as that used
   for ordinary IPv6 address assignments.

3.7.  Security Considerations

   No change from [RFC5969].

3.8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo makes no request of IANA.
