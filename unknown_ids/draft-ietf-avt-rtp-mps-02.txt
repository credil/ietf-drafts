1.  Introduction

   MPEG Surround (Spatial Audio Coding, SAC) [23003-1] is an
   International Standard that was finalized by MPEG in January 2007.
   It is capable of re-creating N channels based on M<N transmitted
   channels and additional control data.  In the preferred modes of
   operating the spatial audio coding system, the M channels can either
   be a single mono channel or a stereo channel pair.  The control data
   represents a significantly lower data rate than the data rate
   required for transmitting all N channels, making the coding very
   efficient while at the same time ensuring compatibility with M
   channel devices.

   The MPEG Surround standard incorporates a number of tools enabling
   features that allow for broad application of the standard.  A key
   feature is the ability to scale the spatial image quality gradually
   from very low spatial overhead towards transparency.  Another key
   feature is that the decoder input can be made compatible to existing
   matrixed surround technologies.

   As an example, for 5.1 multi-channel audio, the MPEG Surround encoder
   creates a stereo (or mono) downmix signal and spatial information
   describing the full 5.1 material in a highly efficient parameterised
   format.  The spatial information is transmitted alongside the
   downmix.

   By using MPEG Surround, existing services can easily be upgraded to
   provide surround sound in a backward compatible fashion.  While a
   stereo decoder in an existing legacy consumer device ignores the MPEG
   Surround data and plays back the stereo signal without any quality
   degradation, an MPEG Surround enabled decoder will deliver high
   quality multi-channel audio.

   The MPEG Surround decoder can operate in modes that render the multi-
   channel signal to multi-channel output, stereo output or operate in a
   two-channel headphone mode to produce a virtual surround output
   signal.

3.  Definitions and Abbreviations

3.1.  Definitions

   This memo makes use of the definitions specified in [14496-1],
   [14496-3], [23003-1] and [RFC3640].  Frequently used terms are summed
   up for convenience:

      Access Unit: An MPEG Access Unit is the smallest data entity to
      which timing information is attributed.  In the case of audio, an
      Access Unit is the smallest individually accessible portion of
      coded audio data within an elementary stream.

      AudioSpecificConfig(): Extends the class DecoderSpecificInfo(), as
      defined in [14496-1] when the objectType indication refers to a
      stream complying with [14496-3].  AudioSpecificConfig() is used as
      the configuration structure for MPEG-4 Audio as specified in
      [14496-3].  It contains the field audioObjectType that
      distinguishes between the different audio codecs defined in
      [14496-3], general audio information (e.g. the sampling frequency
      and number of channels) and further codec-dependent information
      structures.

      SpatialSpecificConfig(): Configuration structure for MPEG Surround
      audio coding as specified in [23003-1].  An AudioSpecificConfig()
      with an audioObjectType of value 30 contains a
      SpatialSpecificConfig() structure.

3.2.  Abbreviations

     AOT:  Audio Object Type
     ASC:  AudioSpecificConfig() structure
     AU:   Access Unit
     PLI:  Profile and Level Indication
     SSC:  SpatialSpecificConfig() structure


4.  Transport of MPEG Surround

   From a top-level perspective MPEG Surround data can be subdivided
   into configuration data contained in the SpatialSpecificConfig()
   (SSC) and the SpatialFrame() that contains the MPEG Surround payload.
   The configuration data can be signaled in-band or out-of-band.  In
   the case of in-band signaling the SSC is conveyed in an
   SacDataFrame() jointly with a SpatialFrame().  In the case of out-of-
   band signaling the SSC is transmitted to the decoder separately, e.g.
   by SDP means.




de Bont, et al.           Expires July 26, 2009                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Transport of MPEG Surround           January 2009


   SpatialFrame()s may be transmitted either embedded into the downmix
   stream (Section 4.1) or as an individual elementary stream besides
   the downmix audio stream (Section 4.2).

   The buffer definition for AAC decoders limits the size of an AU as
   specified in [14496-3].  For high-bitrate applications that exceed
   this limit all MPEG Surround data MUST be put in a separate stream as
   defined in Section 4.2.

4.1.  Embedded spatial audio data in AAC payloads

   [14496-3] defines the extension_payload() as a mechanism for
   transport of extension data inside AAC payloads.  Typical extension
   data include SBR data and MPEG Surround data, i.e. a SacDataFrame()
   in extension_payload()s of type EXT_SAC_DATA. extension_payload()s
   reside inside the downmix AAC elementary stream.  The resulting
   single elementary stream is transported as specified in [RFC3640].
   As AAC decoders are required to skip unknown extension data, MPEG
   Surround data can be embedded in backwards compatible fashion and be
   transported with the mechanism already described in [RFC3640].

   The SacDataFrame() includes a SpatialFrame() and an optional header
   that contains an SSC.  Any SSC in a SacDataFrame() MUST be identical
   to the SSC conveyed via SDP for that stream.

   No new mode is introduced for SpatialFrame()s being embedded into AAC
   payloads.  Either the mode AAC-lbr or the mode AAC-hbr SHOULD be
   used.  The additional Media Type parameters as defined in Section 5.1
   SHOULD be present when SpatialFrame()s are embedded into AAC
   payloads.

   For example:

   m=audio 5000 RTP/AVP 96
   a=rtpmap:96 mpeg4-generic/48000/2
   a=fmtp:96 streamType=5; profile-level-id=44; mode=AAC-hbr; config=131
     056E598; sizeLength=13; indexLength=3; indexDeltaLength=3; constant
     Duration=2048; MPS-profile-level-id=55; MPS-config=F1B4CF920442029B
     501185B6DA00;

   In this example the stream specifies the HE-AAC Profile at Level 2
   [Profile and Level Indication (PLI) 44] and the config string
   contains the hexadecimal representation of the HE-AAC ASC
   [audioObjectType=2 (AAC LC); extensionAudioObjectType=5 (SBR);
   samplingFrequencyIndex=0x6 (24kHz);
   extensionSamplingFrequencyIndex=0x3 (48kHz); channelConfiguration=2
   (2.0 channels)] of the downmix AAC elementary stream using explicit
   backward compatible signaling.

Internet-Draft         Transport of MPEG Surround           January 2009


   Furthermore, the stream specifies the MPEG Surround Baseline Profile
   at Level 3 (PLI55) and the MPS-config string contains the hexadecimal
   representation of the MPEG Surround ASC [audioObjectType=30 (MPEG
   Surround); samplingFrequencyIndex=0x3 (48kHz); channelConfiguration=6
   (5.1 channels); sacPayloadEmbedding=1; SSC=(48 kHz; 32 slots; 525
   tree; ResCoding=1; ResBands=[0,13,13,13])].

   Note that the a=fmtp lines of the example above have been wrapped to
   fit the page; they comprise each a single line in the SDP file.

4.2.  MPEG Surround Elementary Stream

   MPEG Surround SpatialFrame()s can be present in an individual
   elementary stream.  This stream complements the stream containing the
   downmix audio data, which may be coded by an arbitrary coding scheme.
   MPEG Surround elementary streams are packetized as specified in
   [RFC3640].  The mode signaled and used for an MPEG Surround
   elementary stream MUST be either MPS-hbr or MPS-lbr.  The MPS-hbr
   mode SHALL be used when the frame size may exceed 63 bytes, e.g. when
   high-bitrate residual coding is in use.

   The dependency relationships between the MPEG Surround elementary
   stream and the downmix stream are signaled as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-decoding-dependency].

   The media clocks of the MPEG Surround elementary stream and the
   downmix stream SHALL operate in the same clock domain, i.e. the
   clocks are derived from a common clock and MUST NOT drift.  RTCP
   sender reports MUST indicate that the stream timestamps are not
   drifting, i.e. that a single sender report for each stream is
   sufficient to establish unambiguous timing.  The sampling rate of the
   MPEG Surround signal and the decoded downmix signal MUST be
   identical.

   If HE-AAC is used as the coding scheme for the downmix, the RTP
   clock-rate of the downmix MAY be the sampling rate of the AAC core,
   i.e. the clock-rate of the MPEG Surround elementary stream is an
   integer multiple of the clock-rate of the downmix stream.

   Note that separate RTP streams have different random RTP timestamp
   offsets and therefore RTCP MUST be used to synchronize the coded
   downmix audio data and the MPEG surround elementary stream.

   For example:

   a=group:DDP L1 L2

   m=audio 5000 RTP/AVP 96
   a=rtpmap:96 mpeg4-generic/48000/2
   a=fmtp:96 streamType=5; profile-level-id=44; mode=AAC-hbr; config=2B1
     18800; sizeLength=13; indexLength=3; indexDeltaLength=3; constantDu
     ration=2048
   a=mid:L1

   m=audio 5002 RTP/AVP 97

     aLength=3; constantDuration=2048
   a=mid:L2
   a=depend:97 lay L1:96

   In this example the first stream specifies the High Efficiency AAC
   Profile at Level 2 (PLI44) and the config string contains the
   hexadecimal representation of the HE-AAC ASC [audioObjectType=2 (AAC
   LC); extensionAudioObjectType=5 (SBR); samplingFrequencyIndex=0x6
   (24kHz); extensionSamplingFrequencyIndex=0x3 (48kHz);
   channelConfiguration=2 (2.0 channels)].

   The second stream specifies Baseline MPEG Surround Profile at Level 3
   (PLI55) and the config string contains the hexadecimal represenation
   of the ASC [AOT=30(MPEG Surround); 48 kHz; 5.1-ch;
   sacPayloadEmbedding=0; SSC=(48 kHz; 32 slots; 525 tree; ResCoding=1;
   ResBands=[7,7,7,7])]

   Note that the a=fmtp lines of the example above have been wrapped to
   fit the page; they comprise each a single line in the SDP file.

4.2.1.  Low Bit-rate MPEG Surround

   This mode is signaled by mode=MPS-lbr.  This mode supports the
   transport of one or more complete Access Units, each consisting of a
   single MPEG Surround SpatialFrame().  The AUs can be variably sized
   and interleaved.  The maximum size of a SpatialFrame() is 63 bytes.
   Fragmentation MUST NOT be used in this mode.  Receivers MUST support
   de-interleaving.

   The payload configuration is the same as in the AAC-lbr mode.  It
   consists of the AU Header Section, followed by concatenated AUs.
   Note that Access Units are byte-aligned.  The Auxiliary Section MUST
   be empty in the MPS-lbr mode.  The one-octet AU-header MUST provide:

Internet-Draft         Transport of MPEG Surround           January 2009


   1.  the size of each AAC frame encoded as 6 bits

   2.  2 bits index information for computing the sequence (and hence
       timing) of each SpatialFrame().

   The concatenated AU-header Section MUST be preceded by the 16-bit AU-
   header-length field.

   In addition to the required Media format parameters, the following
   parameters MUST be present with fixed values: sizeLength (fixed value
   6), indexLength (fixed value 2) and indexDeltaLength (fixed value 2).
   The parameter maxDisplacement MUST be present when interleaving.
   SpatialFrame()s always have a fixed duration per AU; the fixed
   duration MUST be signaled by the Media format parameter
   constantDuration.

   The value of the "config" parameter is the hexadecimal representation
   of the ASC, as defined in [14496-3] with an AOT of 30 and the
   sacPayloadEmbedding flag set to 0.

   The "profile-level-id" parameter SHALL contain a valid PLI for MPEG
   Surround as specified in [14496-3].

4.2.2.  High Bit-rate MPEG Surround

   This mode is signaled by mode=MPS-hbr.  This mode supports the
   transportation of either one fragment of an Access Unit or one
   complete AU or several complete AUs.  Each AU consists of a single
   MPEG Surround SpatialFrame().  The AUs can be variably sized and
   interleaved.  The maximum size of a SpatialFrame() is 8191 bytes.
   Receivers MUST support de-interleaving.

   The payload configuration is the same as in the AAC-hbr mode.  It
   consists of the AU Header Section, followed by either one
   SpatialFrame(), a fragment of a SpatialFrame() or several
   concatenated SpatialFrame()s.  Note that Access Units are byte-
   aligned.  The Auxiliary Section MUST be empty in the MPS-hbr mode.
   The two-octet AU-header MUST provide:

   1.  the size of each AAC frame encoded as 13 bits

   2.  3 bits index information for computing the sequence (and hence
       timing) of each SpatialFrame(), i.e. the AU-Index or AU-Index-
       delta field.

   Each AU-Index field MUST be coded with the value 0.  The concatenated
   AU-header Section MUST be preceded by the 16-bit AU-header-length
   field.

Internet-Draft         Transport of MPEG Surround           January 2009


   In addition to the required Media format parameters, the following
   parameters MUST be present with fixed values: sizeLength (fixed value
   13), indexLength (fixed value 3) and indexDeltaLength (fixed value
   3).  The parameter maxDisplacement MUST be present when interleaving.
   SpatialFrame()s always have a fixed duration per AU; the fixed
   duration MUST be signaled by the Media format parameter
   constantDuration.

   The value of the "config" parameter is the hexadecimal representation
   of the ASC, as defined in [14496-3] with an AOT of 30 and the
   sacPayloadEmbedding flag set to 0.

   The "profile-level-id" parameter SHALL contain a valid PLI for MPEG
   Surround as specified in [14496-3].


5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo defines additional optional format parameters to the Media
   subtype audio/mpeg4-generic.  These parameters SHALL only be used in
   combination with the AAC-lbr or AAC-hbr modes (cf. [RFC3640] section
   3.3).

5.1.  Media Type registration

   This memo defines the following additional optional parameters which
   SHALL be used if MPEG Surround data is present inside the payload of
   an AAC elementary stream.

      MPS-profile-level-id: A decimal representation of the MPEG
      Surround Profile Level indication as defined in [14496-3].  This
      parameter MUST be used in the capability exchange or session
      set-up procedure to indicate the MPEG Surround Profile and Level
      that the decoder must be capable of in order to decode the stream.

      MPS-config: A hexadecimal representation of an octet string that
      expresses the AudioSpecificConfig (ASC) as defined in [14496-3]
      for MPEG Surround.  The ASC is mapped onto the hexadecimal octet
      string in an MSB-first basis.  The AOT in this ASC SHALL have the
      value 30.  The SSC inside the ASC MUST have the
      sacPayloadEmbedding flag set to 1.

5.2.  Registration of Mode Definitions with IANA

   This section requests the registration of the "MPS-hbr" value and the
   "MPS-lbr" value for the "mode" parameter of the "mpeg4-generic" media
   type.  The "mpeg4-generic" media type is defined in [RFC3640], and
   [RFC3640] defines a repository for the "mode" parameter.  We are



de Bont, et al.           Expires July 26, 2009                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         Transport of MPEG Surround           January 2009


   registering the modes MPS-hbr and MPS-lbr to support MPEG Surround
   elementary streams.

   Media type name:

      audio

   Subtype name:

      mpeg4-generic

   Required parameters:

      The "mode" parameter is required by [RFC3640].  [RFC3640] requests
      a repository for "mode", so that new values for mode may be added.
      We request that the values "MPS-hbr" and "MPS-lbr" be added to the
      "mode" repository.

   Optional parameters:

      In the modes AAC-hbr and AAC-lbr, we request the registration of
      the additional optional parameters MPS-profile-level-id and MPS-
      config.  See Section 4.1 for usage details of these parameters in
      the modes AAC-hbr and AAC-lbr.

      In the modes MPS-hbr and MPS-lbr, the use of optional parameters
      is according [RFC3640].

5.3.  Usage of SDP

   It is assumed that the Media format parameters are conveyed via an
   SDP message as specified in [RFC3640], section 4.4.


6.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this memo are subject
   to the security considerations of the RTP specification [RFC3550] and
   [RFC3640] which is extended with this memo.  This implies that
   confideniality of the media streams is achieved by encryption.
   Because the data compression used with this payload format is applied
   end-to-end, encryption may be performed on the compressed data so
   there is no conflict between the two operations.
