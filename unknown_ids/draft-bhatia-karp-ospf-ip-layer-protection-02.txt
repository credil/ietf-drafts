     Security Extension for OSPFv2 when using Manual Key Management
             draft-bhatia-karp-ospf-ip-layer-protection-02

Abstract

   The current OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as defined
   in the OSPF standards is vulnerable to both inter and intra replay
   attacks when its uses manual keying.  Additionally, the existing
   cryptographic authentication schemes do not cover the IP header.
   This omission can be exploited to carry out various types of attacks.

   This draft proposes an authentication scheme based on a challenge-
   response mechanism that will protect OSPFv2 from both inter and intra
   replay attacks when its using manual keys for securing its protocol
   packets.  Later we also describe some changes in the cryptographic
   hash computation so that we eliminate most attacks that result
   because of OSPFv2 not protecting the IP header.

1.  Introduction

   The OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as described in
   [[RFC2328]] uses per-packet sequence numbers to provide protection
   against replay attacks.  The sequence numbers increase monotonically
   so that the attempts to replay the stale packets can be thwarted.
   The sequence number values are maintained as a part of adjacency
   states.  Therefore, if an adjacency is broken down, the associated
   sequence numbers get re-initiated and the neighbors start all over
   again.  Additionally, the cryptographic authentication mechanism does
   not specify how to deal with the rollover of a sequence number when
   it reaches its maximum limit.  These omissions can be taken advantage
   of by attackers to implement various replay attacks ([RFC6039]).  In
   order to address these issues, we propose a challenge/ response
   mechanism that introduces two additional random numbers to help
   routers generate distinguishable new states when the sequence numbers
   need to be re-initiated.  Compared with the cryptographic
   authentication mechanism proposed in [RFC5709], the solution proposed
   does not impose any more security presumption.

   The cryptographic authentication as described in [RFC2328] and later
   updated in [RFC5709] does not include the IP header.  This also can
   be exploited to launch several attacks as the source address in the
   IP header is no longer protected.  The OSPF specification, in certain
   cases, requires the implementations to look at the source address
   carried in the IP header to determine the neighbor the packet was
   recieved from.  Changing the source address of a packet can thus,
   confuse the reciever which can be exploited to produce a number of
   denial of service attacks [RFC6039].  If the packet is interpreted as
   coming from a different neighbor, the sequence number received from
   the neighbor may be updated.  This may disrupt communication with the
   legitimate neighbor.  Hello packets may be reflected to cause a
   neighbor to appear to have one-way communication.  Old Database
   descriptions may be reflected in cases where the per-packet sequence
   numbers are sufficiently divergent in order to disrupt an adjacency
   [I-D.hartman-ospf-analysis].  This is referred to as the IP layer
   issue in [I-D.ietf-karp-threats-reqs].

   [RFC2328] states that implementations MUST offer keyed MD5
   authentication.  It is likely that this will be deprecated in favor
   of the stronger algorithms described in [RFC5709] in future
   deployments [I-D.ietf-opsec-igp-crypto-requirements].

   This draft proposes a simple change in the cryptographic
   authentication mechanism, as currently described in [RFC5709], to
   prevent such IP layer attacks.

2.  A Challenge and Response Solution

   In OSPFv2, a non-decreasing sequence member is associated with each
   OSPF packet sent from a router in order to prevent replay attacks.
   However, as illustrated in [I-D.hartman-ospf-analysis] and [RFC6039],
   in the circumstances where automatic key management mechanisms are
   unavailable, any re-initiation of sequence numbers can potentially be
   taken advantage of to perform replay attacks.  In this section, we
   introduce an extension of the OSPFv2 protocol, which uses challenge/
   response to benefit the verification of the freshness of OSPF packets
   when the sequence numbers of routers are re-initiated.  This solution
   eliminates the reliance on automatic key management mechanisms.
   However, it is assumed that a traffic key is shared between two
   communicating routers so that an attacker can play antique packets
   but lacks the capability to modify packets without being detected.

   In this protocol, two random numbers (Session ID and Nonce) are
   introduced.  The session ID is used to identify the session a packet
   is within and thus makes inter-session replay attacks difficult.  The
   nonce is used to challenge the liveness of communicating routers so
   that states need not be maintained with routers that are not
   currently neighbors.  In combination with the sequence number, the
   session ID can effectively resist intra-session replay attacks.  When
   the sequence space is exhausted, a router simply chooses a new
   session ID.

   Figure 1 illustrates how two routers A and B, challenge each other's
   liveness when they are initially connected to a link.  First, A
   selects a new session ID (X1) and a new nonce (N1), and sends them
   out within a hello packet (see step 1).  Particularly, X1and N1 are
   encapsulated in the OSPF header of the packet.  Note that if A is on
   a multicast LAN, the packet is sent using multicast.  Similarly, B
   sends a hello packet with its new session ID (X2) and Nonce (N2)
   (step 2).  Upon receiving the hello packet from B, A sends a hello
   packet with X1 and N1.  In the neighbor field of the packet, the
   router ID of B, X2, and N2 is encapsulated (Step 3).  Upon receiving
   the packet sent in step 3, B can ensure the freshness of the packet
   if the attached session ID and nonce values of both routers are
   correct.

   In the same way, after receiving the hello packet from A, B sends a
   hello packet with X2 and N2 in the OSPF header, and in the neighbor
   field of the packet, the router ID of A, X1, and N1 is listed to
   identify that A has been discovered.  After receiving the packet, A
   can make sure the packet is fresh if the session IDs and the nonce of
   both routers contained in the packet are correct.  After A and B
   discover each other, they start exchanging their database information
   (steps 5 and 6).  During the exchange, every packet from Router A is

   associated with X1 and N1, while every packet from Router B is
   associated with X2 and N2.  Each of these packets also contains a
   sequence number as part of the cryptographic authentication option.
   The sequence number MUST increase for every packet sent.

   After A and B have generated a neighbor relationship, assume another
   router, C, is connected to the link.  C finds the existence of A and
   intends to become a neighbor of A. The packets exchanged during this
   process are illustrated in Figure 2.  Firstly, C selects a new
   session ID (X3) and a new nonce value (N3), and sends them out within
   a blank hello packet (see the second step of Figure 2).  After
   receiving this packet, A sends out a hello packet with the
   information of C (router ID, X3, and N3) in the neighbor field.

   Because A is challenging the liveness of a new neighbor, A selects a
   new nonce N1' and encapsulates it in the OSPF header of the hello
   packet to challenge whether the packet sent in step 2 is really from
   C. After receiving the packet from A, C can make sure the packet is
   valid since it consists of its current session ID and nonce (e.g., X3
   and N3).  Thus, C replies to A with a hello packet including the
   information of A (e.g., X1 and N1') in the neighbor field.  After
   receiving this packet and checking the correctness of X1 and N1', A
   can ensure that the packet is fresh and C is currently online.

   It worthwhile to note that during the challenge and response the
   hello packets sent immediately amnogst routers.

   Figure 3 illustrates the scenario in which router A is rebooted.
   After the reboot, A lost its state and selects a new session ID (X4)
   and a new nonce value (N4).  However, B still maintains the earlier
   session ID and nonce values of A (X1 and N1).  In step 1, A sends a
   blank hello packet out with its new session ID and nonce value.
   After receiving the hello packet, B realizes that the session ID and
   the nonce value of A in the OSPF header are different from the ones
   maintained in its database.  In order to distinguish a reboot from a
   replay of an old packet, B selects a new nonce value, N2', and

   transports it as well as its session ID (X2) in a hello packet to
   check whether the packet is from A. In the neighbor field of this
   packet, B continues listing A with the earlier session ID and nonce
   values (i.e., X1 and N1).  Therefore, if an attacker attempts to send
   an antique packet to masquerade as A, A would update its database
   with the new nonce of B and send a hello packet with its existing
   Session ID and nonce values (X1 and N1).  In step 3, B receives a new
   hello packet consisting of B's new nonce value from A. Since this
   packet lists B with the new nonce value in the neighbors field of the
   hello and since the nonce is new, this packet cannot be a replay.
   Now, B can safely assume that A has indeed restarted and can start
   using the new session ID and the nonce values sent by A in the
   neighbor field of its hellos.

2.1.  Receiver Behavior

   This section describes how OSPF receivers will handle the reception
   of packets with the nonce and session ID.

   If a packet other than a hello is received with the new cryptographic
   authentication option, it must correspond to an existing neighbor
   relationship in at least the 2-way state.  If the neighbor is not in
   2-way state or greater, the packet is discarded.  If the session ID
   does not match the session ID recorded with the neighbor, the packet
   is discarded.  If the sequence number in the cryptographic



Bhatia, et al.            Expires July 23, 2011                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         OSPF Manual Key Management           January 2011


   authentication option is not strictly greater than the sequence
   number associated with the neighbor, then the packet is discarded.
   If the cryptographic verification of the checksum fails, the packet
   is discarded.  Otherwise, the packet is accepted by the cryptographic
   authentication and the sequence number associated with the neighbor
   is updated to be the sequence number in the packet.

   If a hello is received for a neighbor that is not found or that has
   not reached 2-way state, the following steps are performed.  If a
   neighbor structure exists for the neighbor and the session ID match
   that stored in the neighbor structure, then the packet is processed
   as follows.  The sequence number is checked and MUST be strictly
   greater than the sequence number in the neighbor structure.  The
   cryptographic authentication is verified.  If this router is listed
   in the set of neighbors in the hello packet, the nonce and session ID
   MUST match this router's current nonce and session ID.  If any of
   these checks fail, the packet is discarded.  Otherwise the packet is
   accepted past cryptographic processing.

   By this point, the router has received a hello packet.  Either no
   neighbor structure exists or the session ID has changed.  Before
   permitting communication with this router, its liveness needs to be
   challenged.  If a new neighbor has been added since the last nonce
   trigger, then a nonce trigger (see Section 2.2is performed and the
   packet is discarded.  If this router is listed in the list of
   neighbors, it MUST be listed with its current session ID and nonce
   otherwise the packet is discarded.  If verification of the
   cryptographic checksum fails, the packet is discarded.  Otherwise,
   the session ID, nonce and sequence number associated with the
   neighbor are updated from the packet and the packet is accepted by
   cryptographic authentication processing.  If a neighbor structure is
   added, then nonce trigger state is updated to indicate that a
   neighbor has been added.

2.2.  Nonce Triggers

   The router keeps track of whether a nonce trigger has happened since
   the last time a neighbor is added.

   In order to test liveness, a router updates its current nonce to a
   new value.  As a side effect, all routers on the link will update the
   nonce of the router associated with this router.  More importantly,
   though, the router we are testing liveness with will update the nonce
   in its hello entry for this router.  That will allow this router to
   confirm that the session ID is correct and corresponds to current

3.  Packet Format

   In the challenge/ response mechanism, every OSPFv2 packet MUST carry
   the current Session ID and the associated Nonce value.  This section
   describes how this information is carried in the OSPFv2 packets.

   The OSPF packet header includes an authentication type field, and 64-
   bits of data for use by the appropriate authentication scheme
   (determined by the type field).  Authentication types 0, 1 and 2 are
   defined in [RFC2328].  This document defines Authentication type 3.

   When using this authentication scheme the 64 bit Authentication field
   in the OSPF packet header remains unchanged and is the same as
   defined in Section D.3 of [RFC2328].  NOTE to the WG: We can also
   increase the size of the Key ID.  Currently it has been kept as, but
   nothing prevents us from changing this.

   The Session ID and the Nonce information is placed before the message
   digest that is appended to the OSPF packet.  In this case too, the
   final Authentication data is not actually considered part of the OSPF
   protocol packet.

4.  Key Selection in Processing OSPF Packets

   This section introduces how the proposed security solution looks up
   long lived keys from key tables [I-D.ietf-karp-crypto-key-table].
   Generally, a proper key selected to process an OSPFv2 packet should
   satisfy the requirements listed as follows:

      the key is in its valid period; and

      the key can be used for the desired security algorithm.

   In the remainder of this section, other requirements that a selected
   key should particularly satisfy are depicted in different scenarios.

4.1.  Key Selection in Sending Unicast OSPF Packets

   Assume that a router R1 tries to send a unicast OSPF packet from its
   interface I1 to the interface R2 of a remote router R2 using security
   protocol P via interface I at time T. Firstly consider the
   circumstances where R1 and R2 are not connected with a virtual link.
   R1 then needs to select a long long-lived symmetric key from its key
   table.  Because the key should be shared by the by both R1 and R2 to
   protect the communication between I1 and I2, the key should satisfy
   the following requirements:

      the Peer field includes the router ID of R2;

      the PeerKeyID field is not "unknown";

      the Interfaces field includes I1; and

      the Direction field is either "out" or "both".

   When R1 and R2 are at the ends of a virtual link, the condition is a
   little more complex.  Because the virtual link can be regarded as an
   unnumbered point-to-point network, the IP address of the interface
   actually used to send the packet (i.e., I1) is discovered during the
   routing table build process.  Therefore, when the system operator
   deploys the keys to protect the virtual link, I1 has not been
   specified yet.  Therefore, the key should be identified by the router
   IDs rather than by the interface originating the packet, and the
   third requirement introduced above should be changed to "the
   Interface field includes the router ID".

4.2.  Key Selection in Sending Multicast OSPF Packets

   If a router R1 sends an OSPF packet from its interface I1 to a
   multicast address (e.g., AllSPFRouters, AllDRouters), it needs to

Internet-Draft         OSPF Manual Key Management           January 2011


   select a key according to the following requirements:

      the Peer field includes the multicast address;

      the PeerKeyID field is "group";

      the Interfaces field includes I1; and

      the Direction field is either "out" or "both".

4.3.  Key Selection on Receiving OSPF Packets

   When Cryptographic Authentication is employed, the ID of the adopted
   key is encapsulated within the authentication field of an OSPF packet
   header.  Using this ID, it is relatively easy for a receiver to
   locate the key.  The requirement is relatively simple:

      the Peer field includes the router ID of the sender; and

      the PeerKeyID field includes the key ID obtained from the
      authentication field

5.  Existing Cryptographic Authentication Mechanism

   The overall cryptographic authentication process defined in [RFC5709]
   remains unchanged.  To reduce the potential for confusion, this
   section minimises the repetition of text from RFC 5709 and is
   incorporated here by reference [RFC5709].

   RFC 5709, Section 3.3, describes how the cryptographic authentication
   must be computed.  It requires OSPFv2 packet's Authentication Trailer
   (which is the appendage described in RFC 2328, Section D.4.3, Page
   233, items (6)(a) and (6)(d)) to be filled with the value Apad where
   Apad is a hexadecimal constant value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L/4) times,
   where L is the length of the hash being used and is measured in
   octets rather than bits.

Internet-Draft         OSPF Manual Key Management           January 2011


6.  Mechanism to secure the IP header

   This document updates the definition of Apad which is currently a
   constant defined in [RFC5709] to the source address thats carried in
   the IP header of the OSPFv2 protocol packet.  Routers at the sending
   side must initialize Apad to a value of the source address that would
   be used when sending out the OSPFv2 packet, repeated L/4 times, where
   L is the length of the hash, measured in octets.  The basic idea is
   to incorporate the source address from the IP header in the
   cryptographic authentication computation so that any change there can
   be detected.

   At the recieving end implementations MUST initialize Apad as the
   source address that exists in the IP Header of the incoming OSPFv2
   protocol packet, repeated L/4 times, instead of the constant that's
   currently defined in [RFC5709].  Besides changing the value of Apad
   this document does not introduce any other changes to the
   authentication mechanism described in [RFC5709].

   This would prevent all attacks where a rogue OSPF router changes the
   source address of the protocol packet and reflects it on some other
   interface as the authentication check would fail and all such packets
   would get rejected.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document attempts to fix the manual key management procedure
   that currently exists within OSPFv2, as part of the Phase 1 of the
   KARP Working Group.  This therefore, only considers manual key
   management mechanism to be used for OSPFv2.  Any solution that takes
   advantage of the automatic key management mechanism is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   This document also provides a solution to prevent certain denial of
   service attacks that can be launched by changing the source address
   in the IP header of the OSPFv2 protocol packet.

   currently uses 3 to foster pre-standard deployments.
