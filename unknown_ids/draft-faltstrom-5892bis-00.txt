             The Unicode code points and IDNA - Unicode 6.0
                     draft-faltstrom-5892bis-00.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies updates Section 2.7 of RFC 5892 so that the
   calculation of the rules are backward compatible when Unicode 6.0 is
   released.

Internet-Draft               IDNA Codepoints                October 2010


1.  Introduction

   RFC 5892 [RFC5892] specifies an algorithm that based on The Unicode
   Standard [Unicode6] defines a derived property value.  Unicode 6.0
   have one codepoint that has changed GeneralCategory which implies the
   codepoint would move from PVALID to DISALLOWED.

   This document updates section 2.7 Backward Compatible and adds the
   codepoint U+19DA NEW TAI LUE THAM DIGIT ONE to it.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  New section 2.7

   Between Unicode 5.2 and 6.0, three codepoints have changed in a non-
   compatible way.  U+0CF1 and U+0CF2 move from DISALLOWED to PVALID,
   and can be treated as codepoints that move from UNASSIGNED to PVALID.
   U+19DA moves from PVALID to DISALLOWED due to a change of
   GeneralCategory from Nd to No.  This new section 2.7 has added U+19DA
   for backward compatibility reasons.

2.1.  BackwardCompatible (G)

   G: cp is in {19DA}

   This category includes the code points that property values in
   versions of Unicode after 5.2 have changed in such a way that the
   derived property value would no longer be PVALID or DISALLOWED.  If
   changes are made to future versions of Unicode so that code points
   might change property value from PVALID or DISALLOWED, then this
   table can be updated and keep special exception values so that the
   property values for code points stay stable.

   PVALID -- Would otherwise have been DISALLOWED

   19DA; PVALID     # NEW TAI LUE THAM DIGIT ONE


3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  IDNA derived property value registry

   IANA is to update the algorithm used for derived property value
   registry to reflect this change in the algorithm.

4.  Security Considerations

   If algorithm presented in RFC 5892 [RFC5892] is applied to Unicode
   6.0 without adding the change described in this document, the
   codepoint U+19DA will have the wrong derived property value.  That in
   turn will make the codepoint DISALLOWED instead of PVALID.
