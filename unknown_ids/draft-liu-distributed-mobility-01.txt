           Distributed mobility management Problem Statement
                   draft-liu-distributed-mobility-01

Abstract

   Current mobility solutions normally introduce an anchor point in the
   network, eg HA in MIPv6, LMA in PMIPv6, GGSN in 3GPP.  The anchor
   point is used to maintain the mapping between the stable IP address
   (eg Home address in MIPv6) and the current routable IP address (eg
   CoA in MIPv6).  In the hierarchical architecture, since the anchor
   point normally locates in the top of the hierarchical architecture,
   there will no scalability issue.  But in the more flat architecture,
   the anchor point will be much lower compared with hierarchical
   architecture; this will introduce some issues if traditionally
   mobility protocol is used.

1.  Introduction

   As the mobile network is evolving towards the more flat architecture,
   traditional mobility protocol is not suitable for this architecture.
   For example, in the LIPA/SIPTO architecture which is discussed in
   3GPP, the gateway function is located near the base station.  In this
   architecture, if the anchor point locates in the gateway, the
   frequently handover between base station may cause more signaling
   overhead compared with hierarchical architecture.

   The triangle routing issue will become more severe in flat
   architecture, since there will be many UE under one gateway roaming
   to other gateways.  In this condition, the visiting gateway will need
   to establish the mobility tunnel back the original access gateway of
   the UE.

   Due to the triangle routing issue, the traffic could not break out
   locally.

   1) Signaling overhead

   As figure 1 illustrated, in the flat network architecture, the
   mobility anchor point may locates near the base station if
   traditional mobility protocol is used.  The UE's handover between
   base stations may cause frequently handover between anchor points.

   2) Triangle routing

   The triangle routing problem will become more severe in the flat
   architecture if traditional mobility protocol is used.  The mobility
   tunnel needs to be connection back to the anchor point where the UE
   is first access to the network and get the IP address allocation.

   For example, if a user opens his mobile phone to see a video
   streaming program at office and then take a subway to get home.  When
   the user gets back to home, the mobility tunnel still need to connect
   back to the anchor point where locates near his office.  This will
   lead all the traffic goes back to the gateway near his office to
   access the Internet instead of locally break out from the base
   station which near his home.

   Local break out

   As the speed of wireless Internet access is increasing rapidly, if
   all the Internet traffic need to go through the core network, it will
   give much pressure to the mobile operator's core network and may
   decline the user experience due to the latency cause by the long
   route to the destination.  It is preferred that the Internet access
   traffic could break out locally, it means that the Internet traffic
   beak out from a gateway which locates near the base station.  To
   ensure the local break, the gateway should have the IP address
   allocation function.  It is also preferred that the network should
   provide mobility in the local break out scenario, so the gateway
   should be the anchor point of mobility.  It is preferred that when UE
   roams to other base station the traffic could break out locally and
   also maintain the session continuity.  That will be a challenge if
   use traditional mobility protocols.

4.  Considerations of distributed mobility solutions

   Based on the above analysis, there may be a need for developing new
   mobility solutions for the flat architecture, the solution may be
   called distributed mobility solutions since the mobility anchor
   function is distributed compared with the centralized mobility anchor
   point of traditional mobility protocol.

   The distributed mobility solutions should make less change to the
   existing network entity.  It is preferred that there is no change
   requirement to the UE and transparent to the application layer.  The
   details of distributed mobility solution requirements will be further
   identified.
