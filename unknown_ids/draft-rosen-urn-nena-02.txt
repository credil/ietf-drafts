1.  Introduction

   NENA is the "Voice of 9-1-1" in North America.  NENA's mission is to
   foster the technological advancement, availability and implementation
   of a universal emergency telephone number system (9-1-1).  In
   carrying out its mission, NENA promotes research, planning, training
   and education.  The protection of human life, the preservation of
   property, and the maintenance of general community security are among
   NENA's objectives.  NENA serves as a link in the delivery of
   emergency services. 9-1-1 has, throughout its evolution, become
   recognized as an asset of the North American public.

   NENA is currently in the process of setting standards, processes and
   procedures for the use of an IP-based Emergency Services IP Network
   (ESInet) for all public safety entities in North America.  This
   activity is supported by a membership composed of private and public
   sector entities that have an interest in 9-1-1 and public safety.
   This effort, dubbed "Next Generation 9-1-1" (NG9-1-1) is based in
   large part on IETF standards for interactive media session
   establishment and emergency calling.

   Some of the solutions being developed by NENA need XML namespaces
   that are managed so that they are unique and persistent.  To assure
   that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a specific
   Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC2141] Namespace ID (NID) for use by
   NENA was deemed appropriate.  Therefore, a full and complete
   registration will follow the namespace specification process as
   defined in [RFC3406].

2.  URN Specification for "nena" NID

  Namespace ID: nena

  Registration Information:
    registration version number: 1
    registration date: YYYY-MM-DD  [RFC Editor, please replace with the
            date of approval of this document for publication as an RFC]

  Declared registrant of the namespace:
    Registering organization
      Name:       National Emergency Number Association (NENA)
      Address:    4350 North Fairfax Drive, Suite 750
                  Arlington, VA 22203-1695

  Designated contact:
    Role:    NENA Registry Services Administrator
    Email:   nrs-admin@nena.org

  Declaration of syntactic structure:
  The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the "nena"
  NID will have the following structure:
      {NENAclass}:{ClassSpecificString}

   The "NENAclass" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN syntax
   requirements [RFC2141] and defines a specific class of resource type.
   Each class will have a specific labeling scheme that is covered by
   "ClassSpecificString", which also conforms to the naming requirements
   of [RFC2141].

   NENA maintains a naming authority, the National Emergency Number
   Association (NENA) Registration System (NRS) that will manage the
   assignment of "NENAclass" and the specific registration values
   assigned for each class.  Other NENA Standards documents will define
   the "ClassSpecificStrings" for a given "NENAclass".

   Relevant ancillary documentation:
   The National Emergency Number Association Registration System (NRS)
   provides information on the registered resources and the
   registrations for each.  More information about NRS and the
   registration activities and procedures to be followed are defined in
   "NENA Registry System Standard", NENA 70-001 [NENA70-001], which is
   available at: http://www.nena.org/standard/nena-registry-system.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:
   The NRS will manage resources using the "nena" NID and will be the
   authority for managing the resources and subsequent strings
   associated.  The NRS shall ensure the uniqueness of all nena URNs by

   checking such names against the list of existing namespace names, as
   documented in NENA 70-001 [NENA70-001].

   Identifier persistence considerations:
   NRS will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of the
   "nena" NID.  NRS will establish a registry for NENAclass as defined
   in NENA08-003 [NENA08-003].  Each NENAclass will have a separate
   description in the registry and may have its own sub-registry.  In
   particular new NENAclass registry entries will require a full NENA
   technical standard document.

   TNRS will maintain a website at a stable address which provides XML
   and text renderings of the urn:nena registry.

   Process of identifier assignment:
   The NRS processes and procedures for identifier assignment is
   documented in NENA 07-001 [NENA70-001].  The registry that will
   control the urn:nena namespace is defined in NENA 08-003
   [NENA08-003].  In particular, assignments to the NENAclass registry
   will require a NENA Technical Standard document.  Subregistries for
   particular NENAclasses may be established by such technical
   standards.  Subregistries may be defined to have more liberal
   management policies as defined in NENA 70-001 [NENA70-001], but must
   be NRS managed and will not be permitted to be delegated to any other
   organization or registry.  Thus NRS will manage the entire urn:nena
   tree.

   Process for identifier resolution:
   The namespace is not currently listed with a Resolution Discovery
   System (RDS), but nothing about the namespace prohibits the future
   definition of appropriate resolution methods or listing with an RDS.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:
   No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
   [RFC2141] apply.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:
   No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:
   None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
   implemented in support of NENA activities.

   Scope:
   Global

3.  Examples

   The following examples are representative URNs that could be assigned
   by NRS.  They may not be the actual strings that would be assigned.

   NENAresource "psaproute"
   Syntax: "urn:nena:emergencyresponders:<responder name>"
   ResourceSpecificString: simple string with name of responder,
                           defined in a sub-registry
   Use: Defines the URN to be used for queries to an NG9-1-1 Emergency
   Call Routing Function that provides URIs for responding agencies.

   Examples:
   urn:nena:emergencyresponders:ambulance
   urn:nena:emergencyresponders:fire
   urn:nena:emergencyresponders:police
   urn:nena:emergencyresponders:poison
   urn:nena:emergencyresponders:coastguard
   urn:nena:emergencyresponders:marine


4.  Namespace Considerations

   The National Emergency Number Association has developed standards for
   emergency calling in North America for several decades.  NENA is
   developing a variety of applications and services using Internet
   protocols built upon on IETF standards.  Some of these services
   require that supporting information (e.g., data descriptions,
   attributes, etc.) be fully specified.  For proper operation,
   descriptions of the needed supporting information must exist and be
   available in a unique, reliable, and persistent manner.  These
   dependencies provide the basis of need for namespaces, in one form or
   another and will enable NENA to define URNs that are to assign
   cleaner, more general, more permanent, more reliable, and more
   controllable namespace names related to NENA standards, while keeping
   urns defined by NENA properly separate from the IETF defined URNs.

   As the National Emergency Number Association work is ongoing and
   covers many technical areas, the possibility of binding to various
   other namespace repositories has been deemed impractical.  Each
   object or description, as defined in NENA, could possibly be related
   to multiple different other namespaces, so further conflicts of
   association could occur.  Thus the intent is to utilize the National
   Emergency Number Association Registration System, operated by NENA,
   as the naming authority for NENA-defined objects and descriptions.

5.  Community Considerations

   The North American public safety organizations will benefit from
   publication of this namespace by having permanent and reliable URNs
   to be used with protocols defined by NENA.  The objects and
   descriptions required for services defined by NENA are generally
   available for use by other organizations.  The National Emergency
   Number Association will provide access and support for name requests
   by these organizations within the constraints of the defined NRS
   processes and the specific urn:nena registry and subregistries.  This
   support can be enabled in a timely and responsive fashion as new
   objects and descriptions are produced.  These will be enabled in a
   fashion similar to current IANA processes as documented in NENA70-001
   [NENA70-001].

   NRS establishes registries when called for in a NENA Technical
   Standard.  Such standards must provide NRS with clear and concise
   instructions on creating and maintaining such registries.  Defined
   management policies include "NENA Technical Standard Required", "NENA
   Document Required", "Expert Review" and "First Come First Served",
   which correspond to similar IANA management policies.  NENA is
   establishing a website which provides controlled entry of new
   registries and entries in registries, and automatically produces html
   and xml descriptions of registry contents that are used by vendors
   and other consumers of the content.


6.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds a new entry in the urn-namespaces registry.  The
   namespace should be "nena".  The defining document is this RFC.  The
   entry can be found at: http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces
   and any associated mirrors.
