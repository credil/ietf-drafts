INTERNET DRAFT     IEEE 802.11 parameters DHCP Option       May 11, 2010


1  Introduction

   The IEEE 802.11 networks are very popular for providing Internet
   access. The IP address of wireless network access points are
   typically configured using DHCP protocol, but require manual
   configuration of radio parameters. There exists also a few
   autoconfiguration schemas for wireless mesh networks relaying on DHCP
   protocol to configure the 802.11 interfaces. The additional options
   proposed in this document allow to use DHCP to provide the radio
   parameters in addition to the IP address, allowing to enable the
   autoconfiguration procedure. This option may be also used for easy
   manual configuration of basic parameters of wireless access points in
   one central point and distributing it by DHCP protocol.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  IEEE 802.11 radio configuration DCHP option  

   This section defines the DHCP option that configures the SSID and the
   channel number of IEEE 802.11 network. The options have the same
   structure for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6. The option to set the number
   and the SSID has the format shown on the following figure:

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

INTERNET DRAFT     IEEE 802.11 parameters DHCP Option       May 11, 2010

   option-code: OPTION_80211_CHANN_SSID (TBD)

   option-length: Length of the option in octet, must be multiple of
   sixteen (16).

   A DHCP client while requesting the parameters for a IEEE 802.11
   interface that supports this option MAY request the 80211 Channel and
   SSID option.

   The DHCP server returns the option to the client if the server policy
   is configured to do so. The SSID and channel may be preconfigured or
   selected by any algorithm implemented on the server side. If the
   option is received the interface SHOULD be configured to SSID and
   channel transmitted, as long as they are valid for the device.

3  IANA Considerations

   The following DHCP option code for channel and SSID assignment must
   be assigned by IANA:

   Option Name                Value       Described in------------------
   --------------------------------- OPTION_80211_CHANN_SSID    TBD     
      Section 2

4. Security consideration The security considerations in [RFC2131],
   [RFC2132] and [RFC3315] apply.  If an adversary manages to modify the
   response from a DHCP server or insert its own response, the interface
   may be configured to a SSID and channel provided by the intruder. In
   security sensitive environment this should be taken into
   consideration by network administrator.
