			ERP/AAK is
			intended to allow the establishment of cryptographic keying
			materials on one or more Candidate Attachment Points prior to the arrival of
			the MH at the Candidate Access Network (CAN). 
			The document also specifies a method by which the SAP may send
			the identities of neighboring attachment points to the peer in the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start
			message.

			ERP/AAK re-uses the packet format defined by ERP, but specifies a new flag to
			differentiate EAP early-authentication from EAP re-authentication. 
			The peer
			initiates ERP/AAK itself, or does so in response to an
			EAP-Initiate/Re-Auth-Start message from the SAP. 
			In
			this document, it is required that the SAP should support ERP/AAK.  If either the peer or
			the SAP does not support ERP/AAK, it should fall back to full EAP
			authentication.
			<vspace blankLines="1"/>      
			The peer sends an early-authentication request message 
			(EAP-Initiate/Re-auth with the ‘E’ flag set) containing the keyName-NAI, the
			NAS-Identifier, rIK and sequence number. The realm in the keyName-NAI
			field is used to locate the peer’s ERP/AAK server. The NAS-Identifier is used
			to identify the CAP(s). The rIK is used to protect the message. The
			sequence number is used for replay protection. To avoid the same
			pre-established Master Session Key (pMSK) being derived for multiple CAPs, the
			sequence number MUST be unique for each CAP.
			<vspace blankLines="1"/>      
			The SAP encapsulates the early-authentication message into a AAA
			message and sends it to the peer’s ERP/AAK server in the realm indicated in
			the keyName-NAI field.
			<vspace blankLines="1"/>      
			Upon receiving the message, the ERP/AAK server first checks its
			integrity and freshness, then authenticates and authorizes the CAP(s)
			presented in the NAS-Identifier TLV(s). After the CAP(s) is authenticated
			and authorized successfully, the ERP/AAK server derives the pRK and the
			subsequent pMSK for each CAP. 
			<vspace blankLines="1"/>      
			The ERP/AAK server transports the pMSK to the authenticated and authorized
			CAP(s) via AAA as described in <xref target="AAA"/>.
			After the keying materials are delivered, the ERP/AAK server should determine each CA
			whether accepts the pMSK and whether the peer could be attached to. 
			<vspace blankLines="1"/>      
			At last, the ERP/AAK server sends the early-authentication finish message
			(EAP-Finish/Re-auth with E-flag) containing the determinate CAP(s) to
			the peer via the SAP.
		</t>
    </section>

    <section title="ERP/AAK Key Hierarchy">
		<t>
			As an optimization of ERP, ERP/AAK uses key
			hierarchy similar to that of ERP. 
			The EMSK is used to derive the ERP/AAK
			pre-established Root Key (pRK). 
			Similarly, the ERP/AAK pre-established
			Integrity Key (pIK) and the pre-established Master Session Key (pMSK) are derived from
			the pRK. 
			The pMSK is established for the CAP(s) when the peer early
			authenticates to the network. 
			The pIK is established for the peer to
			re-authenticate the network after handover. 
			The hierarchy relationship
			is illustrated in <xref target="KH1"/>, below.

pRK     rRK     ...
</artwork></figure>

			The EMSK and DSRK both can be used to derive the pRK. 
			In general, the
			pRK is derived from the EMSK in case of the peer moving in the home AAA
			realm and derived from the DRSK in case of the peer moving in the
			visited AAA realm. 
			The DSRK is delivered from the EAP server to the ERP/AAK
			server as specified in  <xref target="I-D.ietf-dime-local-keytran"></xref>. 
			If the peer has previously
			authenticated by means of ERP or ERP/AAK, the DSRK SHOULD be
			directly re-used.

			The pRK is used to derive the pIK and pMSK for the CAP(s). Different

			<list>
				<t>
					NAS-Identifier: It is carried in a sub-TLV payload.  It is used to indicate the identifier of candidate
					authenticator. There exactly one instance of the NAS-Identifier TLV MUST be present in
					the ERP/AAK-Key TLV.
				</t>

				<t>
					pMSK-lifetime: It is carried in a sub-TLV payload. The Type is
					TBD. The value field is a 32-bit field and contains the lifetime
					of the pMSK in seconds. If the 'L' flag is set, the pMSK Lifetime
					attribute SHOULD be present.
				</t>

				<t>
					pRK-lifetime: It is carried in a sub-TLV payload. The Type is
					TBD. The value field is a 32-bit field and contains the lifetime
					of the pRK in seconds. If the 'L' flag is set, the pRK Lifetime
					attribute SHOULD be present.
				</t>

				<t>
					List of Cryptosuites: This is a sub-TLV payload. The Type is
					TBD. The value field contains a list of cryptosuites, each 
					1 octet in length. 
					The allowed cryptosuite values are as specified in <xref target="EIRaPE"/>,
					above.
					The server SHOULD include this attribute if the cryptosuite used in
					the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message was not acceptable and the
					message is being rejected. The server MAY include this attribute
					in other cases. The server MAY use this attribute to signal to the
					peer about its cryptographic algorithm capabilities.

        <t>Cryptosuite </t>

        <t>
			This field indicates the integrity algorithm and PRF used for ERP/AAK.
			Key lengths and output lengths are either indicated or are obvious
			from the cryptosuite name.
		</t>

        <t>Authentication Tag</t>

        <t>
			This field contains the integrity checksum over the ERP/AAK packet,
			excluding the authentication tag field itself. The length of the field
			is indicated by the Cryptosuite.

			The TV and TLV attributes are the same specified as section 5.3.4

			which may be present in the EAP-Initiate or EAP-Finish messages are
			defined as below:

				<t>ERP/AAK-Key - This is a TLV payload. The type is TBD.</t>

	<section title="Lower Layer Considerations">
		<t>
			Similar to ERP, some lower layer specifications may need to be revised
			to support ERP/AAK; refer to section 6 of <xref target="RFC5296"></xref>
			for additional guidance.
		</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="AAA" title="AAA Transport Considerations">
		<t>
			AAA transport of ERP/AAK messages is the same as AAA transport of the ERP
			message <xref target="RFC5296"></xref>. In addition, the
			document requires AAA transport of the ERP/AAK keying materials delivered
			by the ERP/AAK server to the CAP. 
			Hence, a new Diameter ERP/AAK application message
			should be specified to transport the keying
			materials.
