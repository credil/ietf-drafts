Internet-Draft   RADIUS Prefix Authorization Application    October 2008


Abstract

   This document specifies a RADIUS application for prefix
   authorization.  Using RADIUS protocol, a client requests prefixes
   from a server; the client gives back the prefixes to the server; the
   client is responsible for renewing the prefixes when the lifetime
   expires.  The RADIUS server can also renumber prefixes.  RADIUS
   clients can be home agents in MIPv6 and NEMO scenario, local mobile
   anchors in Proxy MIPv6 scenario, or common access routers.

Internet-Draft   RADIUS Prefix Authorization Application    October 2008


1.  Introduction

   Prefix assignment for an IPv6 node (host or router) is essential to
   IPv6 address formulation.  Even though IPv6 address space is large
   enough, it still makes sense for operators to manage addresses in a
   central way, e.g. using central DHCPv6 servers or AAA servers.
   Authorizing the use of a prefix that a central server has by a prefix
   user needs communication between different network entities.

   [RFC4968] provides different IPv6 link models that are suitable for
   802.16e [802.16e] based networks and provides analysis of various
   considerations for each link model and the applicability of each link
   model under different deployment scenarios.  As to IPv6 addressing,
   there are two models, shared link model and point-to-point link
   model.  In the former model, an IPv6 prefix is shared by multiple
   MNs.  While in the latter model, a prefix is only assigned to one MN.
   Different MNs can't share a prefix, and an MN can have multiple
   prefixes.  [RFC5121] specifies the addressing and operation of IPv6
   over the IPv6 specific part of the packet convergence sub-layer of
   IEEE Std 802.16e [802.16e], and point-to-point link model is
   recommended.  Also, 3GPP and 3GPP2 have earlier adopted the point-to-
   point link model [RFC3314].

   When an MN attaches an Access Router(AR), the AR requests one or more
   prefixes for the MN.  When the MN detaches the AR, the prefixes
   should be released.  When an operator wants to renumber its network,
   prefixes with different lifetimes are advertised to the MN.  Using
   the mechanism defined in this document, AR can offload prefix
   management to a dedicated server.  The prefix management method
   defined in this document is applicable to this scenario.

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol enables mobility support to a host without
   requiring its participation in any mobility related signaling
   [RFC5213].  Point-to-point access link is supported.  It assumes that
   the mobile node and the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) are the only two
   nodes on the access link.  Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement are used by Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) to allocate
   the prefixes for the mobile node to MAG.  How LMA gets these prefixes
   from external servers is out the scope of PMIPv6 protocol.  The
   prefix management method defined here is also applicable to this
   scenario.

   [RFC3633] defines Prefix Delegation options to provide a mechanism
   for automated delegation of IPv6 prefixes using the Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP).  [I-D.ietf-nemo-dhcpv6-pd] describes
   how DHCPv6 PD can be used by mobile routers and home agents in
   network mobility.

Internet-Draft   RADIUS Prefix Authorization Application    October 2008


   In DHCPv6 PD, the delegating router can receive the prefixes from AAA
   server and Delegated-IPv6-Prefix RADIUS attribute was defined for
   this purpose [RFC4818].  In this case AAA server passively delegates
   the prefixes to the delegating router and it does not have any
   control over these prefixes in cases such as renumbering.  This
   document proposes a new RADIUS application for prefix authorization
   using RADIUS [RFC2865] and [I-D.ietf-radext-design].  This new
   application enables full prefix authorization functionality to the
   AAA servers.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Authorized User IDs and Prefixes:  A collection of prefixes assigned
      to AAA client.  Each has an associated User Identity.  This
      concept is captured in Authorized-UserID-Prefix attribute defined
      in Section 5.4.  An AAA client may have more than one Authorized-
      UserID-Prefix assigned to it; for example, one for each of access
      user's interface.  Also each interface may be assigned more than
      one prefixes.
   User identifier:  An identifier chosen by the client.  Each user has
      an user identifier, which is chosen to be unique among all user
      identifiers for users belonging to that client.  This concept is
      captured in Authorized-UserID attribute defined in Section 5.3.
   Aggregate Prefix:  In Point-to-Point Link Model, AR should broadcast
      the prefixes (MNs route information) dynamically upstream, and
      this causes high routing protocol traffic (OSPF, etc.).  To solve
      the problem, route aggregation should be used.  For example, each
      AR can be assigned a /48 prefix, while an MN's /64 prefix is
      derived from the /48 prefix extension.  The main, higher-level
      prefix is called the Aggregate Prefix.  An AR only broadcasts the
      aggregate prefix upstream.  Aggregate prefix is a pool of
      dedicated prefixes.
   Dedicated Prefix:  A unique prefix used by MN in Point-to-Point Link
      Model.  A dedicated prefix belongs to an aggregate prefix.
      Dedicated prefix information never be broadcasted by routing
      protocol.  In this memo, AAA client requests dedicated prefix
      along with the corresponding aggregate prefix from AAA server.
      Using the corresponding aggregate prefix information, AAA client
      broadcasts upstream MN's route information.

Internet-Draft   RADIUS Prefix Authorization Application    October 2008


   Prefix Authorization Client (PA Client):  RADIUS Client which is
      responsible for exchange with a RADIUS Server to fulfill prefix
      request, release, renew and reconfiguration functions.  In this
      document, it can be a HA for allocating prefix for mobile router,
      or a local mobility anchor (LMA) in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)
      scenario for managing dedicated prefix of MN, or an access router
      in point-to-point link model.
   Prefix Authorization Server (PA Server):  RADIUS Server which is
      responsible for exchange with a RADIUS Client to fulfill prefix
      request, release, renew and reconfiguration functions.  In this
      document, it can be collocated with a RADIUS authentication
      server, or it can be a separated server managing prefixes.
   Prefix Authorization User (PA User):  The end user of prefixes.  In
      this document, it can be MN which configures it's prefixes from
      LMA in PMIPv6 scenario, or a mobile router, or MN which requests
      it's prefix in a visited network.

   Figure 1 shows the architecture of the solution described in this
   document.

                      Figure 1: Architecture Overview

   The use of EAP and the existence of the RADIUS EAP application
   [RFC3579] has made the RADIUS community to separate the act of
   authentication from authorization, and in this case, prefix
   management is a type of authorization.  This way, the peer (MN) and
   AAA client first run an EAP method with the AAA server using RADIUS
   EAP application, followed by a service authorization process for
   prefixes.  To explicitly authorize the prefixes, in this document, we
   define a new RADIUS application.  The application uses RADIUS

   messages defined in [RFC2865] and in [RFC5176].

3.1.  Prefix Request

   A PA Client sends an Access-Request message containing identity of
   the user to a PA server for prefix request.  The client is identified
   using Authorized-UserID in Authorized-UserID-Prefix attribute defined
   in this document.  Access-Request message MUST contain Authorized-
   UserID-Prefix attribute.  The client MAY request an aggregate prefix,
   and then MAY subnet the prefix to the users.  It is also possible
   that the client only requests a dedicated prefix.  The PA server
   allocates one or more prefixes for the client using Access-Accept.
   Lifetime of prefixes is included in Valid Lifetime field of
   Authorized-UserID-Prefix in this message.  The lifetime value
   included is the value proposed by PA Client.

   Access-Request MUST contain Prefix-Authorization type attribute.  The
   value MUST be set to Request.

   PA Server replies with Access-Accept to PA Client.  PA server MUST
   include Authorized-UserID-Prefix attribute in Access-Accept.  The
   server authorizes prefixes included in Authorized-UserID-Prefix to PA
   Client.  The prefixes can be used during Valid Lifetime period.

   Access-Accept MUST contain Prefix-Authorization type attribute.  The
   value MUST be set to Request.

   PA Server replies with Access-Accept if the prefix request can be
   satisfied.  In case of a prefix request that can not be fullfilled by
   PA Server, PA Server sends Access-Reject.  Reception of an Access-
   Reject indicates an unsuccessful prefix request made by PA Client.
   Reply-Message attribute indicates the failure message.  Prefix-
   Authorization type attribute MUST be set to Request.

3.2.  Prefix Release

   When a PA User detaches a PA Client, the prefixes allocated to the
   user should be released.  Access-Request is sent by a PA Client to a
   PA Server.  The server replies with Access-Accept to confirm the
   reception and process of the prefix release.

   PA User and the prefixes to be released are identified in Access-
   Request and Access-Accept using Authorized-UserID-Prefix attribute.
   Multiple occurrences of this attribute can be included to release
   multiple prefixes authorized to the same user or to release prefixes
   authorized to more than one user.

   Access-Request MUST contain Prefix-Authorization type attribute.  The

   value MUST be set to Release.  Access-Accept MUST contain Prefix-
   Authorization type attribute.  The value MUST be set to Release.

   PA Server replies with Access-Accept if the prefix release request
   can be satisfied.  In case of a prefix release request that can not
   be fullfilled by PA Server, PA Server sends Access-Reject.  Reception
   of an Access-Reject indicates an unsuccessful prefix release request
   made by PA Client.  Reply-Message attribute indicates the failure
   message.  Prefix-Authorization type attribute MUST be set to Release.

3.3.  Prefix Renew

   When the lifetime of prefixes will expire, a PA client renews the
   prefix using Access-Request message.  A PA server sends Access-Accept
   with the new lifetime of the prefixes.

   PA User and the prefixes to be renewed are identified in Access-
   Request and Access-Accept using Authorized-UserID-Prefix attribute.
   Multiple occurrences of this attribute can be included to renew
   multiple prefixes authorized to the same user or to renew prefixes
   authorized to more than one user.

   Access-Request MUST contain Prefix-Authorization type attribute.  The
   value MUST be set to Renew.  Access-Accept MUST contain Prefix-
   Authorization type attribute.  The value MUST be set to Renew.

   PA Server replies with Access-Accept if the prefix renew request can
   be satisfied.  In case of a prefix renew request that can not be
   fullfilled by PA Server, PA Server sends Access-Reject.  Reception of
   an Access-Reject indicates an unsuccessful prefix renew request made
   by PA Client.  Reply-Message attribute indicates the failure message.
   Prefix-Authorization type attribute MUST be set to Renew.

3.4.  Prefix Renumbering

   Renumbering is an important feature of IPv6.  A PA Server sends
   Change-of-Authorization-Request message to initiate prefix
   renumbering process.  Once the message is received, a PA client
   replies with Change-of-Authorization-ACK and then starts the prefix
   renumber interactions to acquire new prefixes and reduce the lifetime
   of the old prefixes.  The server sends Access-Accept with new
   prefixes, at the same time the old prefixes are also included in the
   message while the lifetime is reduced.  The procedure is illustrated
   in Figure 2.

   Access-Request MUST contain Prefix-Authorization type attribute.  The
   value MUST be set to Renumber.  Access-Accept MUST contain Prefix-
   Authorization type attribute.  The value MUST be set to Renumber.

   PA Server replies with Access-Accept if the prefix renumber request
   can be satisfied.  In case of a prefix renumber request that can not
   be fullfilled by PA Server, PA Server sends Access-Reject.  Reception
   of an Access-Reject indicates an unsuccessful prefix renumber request
   made by PA Client.  Reply-Message attribute indicates the failure
   message.  Prefix-Authorization type attribute MUST be set to
   Renumber.


4.  Use of Existing RADIUS Attributes

   This section defines existing attributes that are used in the
   messages of prefix authorization application.

4.1.  Service-Type

   PA Client uses Session-Type to indicate that the session is for
   prefix authorization by setting the Session-Type attribute to
   "Authorize Only".

Internet-Draft   RADIUS Prefix Authorization Application    October 2008


4.2.  NAS-Port-Type

   NAS-Port-Type is used by AAA server (PA-Server) to distinguish the
   source of the Access-Request.

   When the Access-Request originates from an MIP6 HA or PMIP6 LMA, NAS-
   Port-Type MUST be included and its value set to HA6 as in
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius].

   When the Access-Request originates from an access router such as
   ASN-GW of WiMAX or Serving Gateway of 3GPP, NAS-Port-Type MUST be
   included and its value set to AR6 (IANA-TBD1).

4.3.  Message Authenticator

   Message-Authenticator attribute defined in [RFC3579] MUST be used to
   protect all messages used in Prefix Authorization application.  In
   the messages used for renumbering, Message-Authenticator attribute is
   calculated as described in [RFC5176].


5.  New Attributes

   This section defines new attributes.

5.1.  Authorized-Prefix Attribute

   The Authorized-Prefix (Ext-Type TBD) contains prefix information.
   This attribute is defined as an extended attribute
   [I-D.ietf-radext-extended-attributes] with a Tag value of zero.

   Each prefix belongs to an aggregate prefix whose length is given in
   Agg Prefix Len. A dedicated prefix is an extension of an aggregate
   prefix.  For example, if PA Client applies a /48 aggregate prefix,
   both aggregate prefix length and prefix length are /48.  If PA Server
   allocates a /64 dedicated prefix belonging to a /48 aggregate prefix
   to PA Client, aggregate prefix length in the attribute SHOULD be /48
   while prefix length SHOULD be /64.  PA Client broadcasts aggregate
   prefix information upstream for traffic routing.

6.  Table of Attributes

   The following tables provides a guide to which attributes may be
   found in RADIUS messages and in what number.  The following defines
   the meaning of the notation used in the following tables:


      0     An instance of this attribute MUST NOT be present.
      1     Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present
      0-1   Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present.
      0+    Zero or more instance of this attriubte MAY be present


   The table below describes the RADIUS messages used for bootstrapping
   and are exchanged between the NAS and the RADIUS Server.


 Request  Accept  Reject  CoA Request  Type    Attribute
  1        1      1       1            PREFIX   Prefix-Authorization
                                       AUTHORIZATION-TYPE
  0+       0+     0+      0+           Group    Authorized-UserID-Prefix



7.  Diameter Considerations

   All the attributes defined in this specification are extended
   attributes.  Diameter compatibility of extended attributes is
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-radext-extended-attributes].


8.  IANA considerations

8.1.  Registration of New AVPs

   This specification defines the following new RADIUS attributes which
   are all extended attributes [I-D.ietf-radext-extended-attributes].

   Prefix-Authorization is set to PREFIX-AUTHORIZATION-TYPE

   Authorized-UserID is set to AUTHORIZED-USERID-TYPE

   Authorized-UserID-Prefix is set to AUTHORIZED-USERID-PREFIX-TYPE

8.2.  New Registry: Prefix Authorization Type

   This specification needs new values for AUTHORIZED-PREFIX-TYPE.  The
   value field is 4 octets.  The current values are listed in

Internet-Draft   RADIUS Prefix Authorization Application    October 2008


   Section 5.2.

8.3.  Addition of Existing Values

   This specification requires a new value of AR6 to be assigned to NAS-
   Port-Type(61).


9.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the extension of RADIUS for Prefix
   Authorization.  The security considerations of the RADIUS protocol
   itself have been discussed in [RFC2865] and in [RFC5176].  Use of the
   attributes defined in this document MUST take into consideration the
   security issues and requirements of the RADIUS Base protocol.
