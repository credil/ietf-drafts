  DNS Security (DNSSEC) DNSKEY IANA Registry Algorithm Status Addition
               draft-ietf-dnsext-dnssec-registry-fixes-04

Abstract

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) has an IANA registry to allocate
   cryptographic algorithm suites for use in generating digital
   signatures over DNS data.  Newly introduced cryptographic algorithms
   to DNSSEC mean implementors need to know which algorithms need to be
   implemented, which are optional, and which are obsolete.  This
   document adds a column to the IANA registry table for Domain Name
   System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers which lists their current
   status for use.

Internet-Draft             IANA Registry Fixes                  May 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], and [RFC4035] uses digital signatures over DNS data to
   provide source authentication and integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses
   an IANA registry to allocate codes for digital signature algorithms
   (consisting of a cryptographic algorithm and one-way hash function).
   Certain digital signature algorithms are considered MANDATORY to
   implement for interoperability while others listed in this registry
   are listed as OPTIONAL or OBSOLETE.

   The original list of algorithm status is found in [RFC4034].  Other
   DNSSEC documents have added new algorithms or changed the status of
   algorithms in the registry.  However, implementors must read through
   all the documents in order to discover which algorithms are mandatory
   to implement and which are optional or no longer used.

   This document requests a column to be added to the IANA registry for
   Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers.  This column
   will list the current status of each digital signature algorithm in
   the registry.

   The key words "MANDATORY", "DISCRETIONARY", "OBSOLETE",
   "DISCOURAGED", "ENCOURAGED" and "RESERVED" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in
   [I-D.ogud-iana-protocol-maintenance-words]

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  DNS Security Algorithm Number Subregistry Fixes

   The DNS Security Algorithm Number subregistry (part of the Domain
   Name System (DNS) Security Number registry) will be modified to
   include a new column.  This column will contain the current
   implementation requirements of the given algorithm.  This document
   does not make any changes to any other column in the registry table.

   There are additional fixes to entries that are described in sub-
   section 2.1.  The overall new registry table is in sub-section 2.2.
   The values for the status were obtained from [RFC4034] with updates
   for algorithms specified after the original DNSSEC specification.
   The status of algorithms marked OPTIONAL in [RFC4034] are changed to
   DISCRETIONARY as defined in
   [I-D.ogud-iana-protocol-maintenance-words].  The status of algorithms

   marked NOT RECOMMENDED in [RFC4034] are changed to OBSOLETE as
   defined in [I-D.ogud-iana-protocol-maintenance-words].

2.1.  Individual Fixes

   This document changes three entries in the Domain Name System
   Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Registry.  They are:

   The description for assignment number 4 is changed to "Reserved until
   2020".

   The description for assignment number 9 is changed to "Reserved until
   2020".

   The description for assignment number 11 is changed to "Reserved
   until 2020".

   Registry entries 13-251 remains Unassigned.

   The status of RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 and DSA-NSEC3-SHA1 are both set to
   DISCRETIONARY.  The status of RSA/SHA-256 and RSA/SHA-512 are set to
   ENCOURAGED as it is believed that these algorithms will replace older
   algorithms (e.g.  RSA/SHA-1) that have a perceived weakness in their
   hash algorithm (SHA-1).

2.2.  Updated Registry Snapshot

   As of the current time, the DNS Security Algorithm Number subregistry
   would look like the following:

   The requirement status for all new algorithms will be DISCRETIONARY
   unless a Standards Track document indicates otherwise (possibly
   including the Standards Track document defining the algorithm).  Only
   a Standards Track document may make an algorithm ENCOURAGED or
   MANDATORY or remove the MANDATORY or ENCOURAGED designation (to
   DISCOURAGED or OBSOLETE for example).

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document consists entirely of DNS IANA Considerations and
   includes the following changes detailed in Section 2.1:

   The description of assignment 4 is changed from "Reserved for ECC" to
   "Reserved until 2020".

   The description of assignment 9 is changed from "Unassigned" to
   "Reserved until 2020".

   The description for assignment number 11 is changed from "Unassigned"
   to "Reserved until 2020".

   Registiry entries 13-251 remains Unassigned.

   The references for current algorithms in the table in Section 2.2
   have been updated to remove obsolete RFC's and replaced with the
   current reference.

   The references to FIPS 180 and FIPS 186 have been updated (to FIPS
   180-3 and FIPS 186-3 respectively) to reflect the latest versions.
   These revisions are maintenance updates and the relevant content of
   the FIPS documents have not changed.

   The new table is in Section 2.2.  The Domain Name System (DNS)
   Security Algorithm Number registry is available at http://
   www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/
   dns-sec-alg-numbers.xhtml.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document seeks to add a status column to an existing IANA
   registry.  It is not meant to be a discussion on algorithm
   superiority.  No new security considerations are raised in this
   document.
