       IPv4 and IPv6 Infrastructure Addresses in MCAST-VPN Routes


                draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-infra-addrs-01.txt

Abstract

   To provide Multicast VPN service, a provider edge router originates
   Multicast-VPN ("MCAST-VPN") BGP routes.  These routes encode
   addresses from the customer's address space as well as addresses from
   the provider's address space.  The customer's address space may be
   either IPv4 or IPv6.  Independently, the provider's address space may
   be either IPv4 or IPv6.  The MCAST-VPN BGP routes always contain an
   "address family" field that specifies whether the customer addresses
   are IPv4 addresses or whether they are IPv6 addresses.  However,
   there is no field that explicitly specifies whether the provider
   addresses are IPv4 addresses or whether they are IPv6 addresses.  To
   ensure interoperability, this document specifies that MCAST-VPN
   routes always encode provider IPv4 addresses as four-octet addresses,
   and that the distinction between an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address
   is signaled solely by the length of the address field.

3. Introduction

   [MVPN-BGP] defines a new set of BGP route types that are used by SPs
   to provide Multicast Virtual Private Network service to their
   customers.  These routes have a newly defined BGP NLRI, the "MCAST-
   VPN" NLRI.  MCAST-VPN NLRI is carried in the NLRI field of the
   MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes defined in [BGP-MP].  The
   SAFI field of the MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute is used to
   identify the NLRI as being an MCAST-VPN NLRI.

   When the SAFI field of an MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute has

Internet Draft  draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-infra-addrs-01.txt   November 2010


   the "MCAST-VPN" value, the AFI field has two defined values: 1 and 2.
   AFI 1 indicates that any customer multicast addresses occurring in
   the MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute are IPv4 addresses; AFI 2
   indicates that any such addresses are IPv6 addresses.

   However, some of the MCAST-VPN routes also contain addresses of PE
   routers in the SP network.  An SP with an IPv4 network may provide
   MVPN service for customers that use IPv6, and an SP with an IPv6
   network may provide MVPN service for customers that use IPv4.
   Therefore the address family of the PE addresses MUST NOT be inferred
   from the AFI field of the associated MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI
   attribute.

   The purpose of this document is to make it clear that whenever a PE
   address occurs in an MCAST-VPN route (whether in the NLRI or in an
   attribute), the IP address family of that address is determined by
   the length of the address (a length of 4 octets for IPv4 addresses, a
   length of 16 octets for IPv6 addresses), NOT by the AFI field of the
   route.

   In particular, if a SP with an IPv4 core network is providing
   MVPN/IPv6 service to a customer, the PE addresses in the MCAST-VPN
   routes will be four-octet IPv4 routes, even though the AFI of those
   routes will have the value 2.

   Some previous specifications (e.g., [RFC4659] and [RFC4798]) have
   taken a different approach, requiring that in any routes containing
   IPv6 or VPN-IPv6 customer addresses, the IPv4 PE addresses be
   represented as IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses [RFC4291].  This document
   does not use that approach.  Rather, this specification uses the
   approach adopted in [RFC4684] and [RFC5549].  The MCAST-VPN routes
   contain enough information to enable the IP address family of the PE
   addresses to be inferred from the address lengths.


4. PE Addresses in MCAST-VPN Routes

   PE addresses occur in MCAST-VPN routes in the following places:

      1. "Network Address of Next Hop" field in the MP_REACH_NLRI
         attribute, as defined in section 3 of [BGP-MP].  This field is
         preceded by a "length of next hop address" field.  Hence it is
         always clear whether the address is an IPv4 address (length is
         4) or an IPv6 address (length is 16).  If the length of next
         hop address is neither 4 nor 16, the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute
         MUST be considered to be "incorrect", and MUST be handled as
         specified in section 7 of [BGP-MP].

Internet Draft  draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-infra-addrs-01.txt   November 2010


      2. "Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route". All MCAST-VPN routes begin with a
         one-octet route type field, followed by a one-octet "NLRI
         length" field.  In the Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route, the length is
         followed by an 8-octet RD, which is then followed by the
         "Originating Router's IP Address" field.  The length of this
         field (4 octets for IPv4 or 16 octets for IPv6 can thus be
         inferred from the NLRI length field (which will be either 12 or
         24, respectively).  If the inferred length of the "Originating
         Router's IP Address" field is neither 4 nor 16, the
         MP_REACH_NLRI attribute MUST be considered to be "incorrect",
         and MUST be handled as specified in section 7 of [BGP-MP].

      3. "S-PMSI A-D Route".  In this route, the "NLRI length" field is
         followed by an 8-octet RD, a variable length "multicast source"
         field, a variable length "multicast group" field, and an
         "Originating Router's IP Address" field.  The two variable
         length fields have their own length fields.  From these two
         length fields and the NLRI length field, one can compute the
         length of the "Originating Router's IP Address" field, which
         again is either 4 for IPv4 or 16 for IPv6.  If the computed
         length of the "Originating Router's IP Address" field is
         neither 4 nor 16, the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute MUST be
         considered to be "incorrect", and MUST be handled as specified
         in section 7 of [BGP-MP].

      4. "Leaf A-D Route".  In this route, the "NLRI length" field is
         following by a variable length "route key", which is followed
         by the "Originating Router's IP Address" field.  The Route Key
         has its own length field.  From the NLRI length and the route
         key length, one can compute the length of the "Originating
         Router's IP Address" field.  If the computed length of the
         "Originating Router's IP Address" field is neither 4 nor 16,
         the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute MUST be considered to be
         "incorrect", and MUST be handled as specified in section 7 of
         [BGP-MP].

      5. "VRF Route Import Extended Community".  The "VRF Route Import
         Extended Community", as specified in [MVPN-BGP], can only carry
         an IPv4 address.  To carry an IPv6 address, the "IPv6 Address
         Specific Route Target" as specified in [RFC5701] MUST be used.

5. PMSI Tunnel Attributes in I-PMSI A-D Routes

   When a PMSI Tunnel Attribute occurs in an I-PMSI A-D route originated
   by a particular PE or ASBR, it identifies a tunnel that the PE/ASBR
   uses by default for carrying the multicast traffic of a particular
   customer MVPN.  The proper encoding and interpretation of the PMSI
   Tunnel attribute is affected by both the AFI and "Network Address of
   Next Hop" fields.


5.1. Relationship to AFI Value

   When the PMSI Tunnel Attribute occurs in a BGP Update message with a
   MP_REACH_NLRI attribute whose AFI is 1, the meaning is that the
   identified tunnel is used by default to carry IPv4 MVPN traffic for a
   particular customer MVPN. When the PMSI Tunnel Attribute occurs in a
   BGP Update message with a MP_REACH_NLRI attribute whose AFI is 2, the
   meaning is that the identified tunnel is used by default to carry
   IPv6 MVPN traffic for a particular customer MVPN.  To assign both
   IPv4 and IPv6 MVPN traffic to an I-PMSI tunnel, two I-PMSI A-D routes
   MUST be used, one whose MP_REACH_NLRI has an AFI of 1, and one whose
   MP_REACH_NLRI has an AFI of 2.  To use the same tunnel for both IPv4
   and IPv6 traffic, the same value of the PMSI Tunnel attribute can be
   used in each route.


5.2. Relationship to Next Hop Address Family

   If the "Network Address of Next Hop" field in the MP_REACH_NLRI
   attribute contains an IPv4 address, then any IP addresses appearing
   in the "Tunnel Identifier" field of the PMSI Tunnel Attribute MUST be
   IPv4 addresses.

   If the "Network Address of Next Hop" field in the MP_REACH_NLRI
   attribute contains an IPv6 address, then any IP addresses appearing
   in the "Tunnel Identifier" field of the PMSI Tunnel Attribute MUST be
   IPv6 addresses.

   If these conditions are not met, the PMSI Tunnel Attribute MUST be
   handled as a "malformed" PMSI Tunnel Attribute, as specified in
   section 5 [MVPN-BGP].
