Internet-Draft         Session Recording Protocol               May 2011


1.  Introduction

   Communication Session (CS) recording requires establishment of the
   recording session between communication system and recording system.
   In order to allow access to such recordings, the metadata about the
   CS shall be sent from the SRC to the SRS.

   The SIP-based Media Recording Requirements [I-D.ietf-siprec-req] list
   a set of requirements that need to be met by session recording
   protocols.  The Session Recording Protocol, which is specified in
   this document, meets these requirements.

   The Session Recording Protocol uses SIP as the protocol for session
   establishment with special attention to reducing size of the required
   SIP messages.  In addition, it is designed for future extendability
   and protocol version management to ensure backward compatability.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Section 2
   defines the terminology used throughout this document, Section 3
   discusses the scope of the Session Recording Protocol, Section 4
   provides a non-normative overview of recording operations, Section 5
   provides normative description of SIP extensions for the Recording
   Session, Section 6 provides normative description of SIP extensions
   for recording-aware user agents.


2.  Definitions

   The core defintions are taken from the requirements document
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-req].

      Session Recording Server (SRS): A Session Recording Server (SRS)
      is a SIP User Agent (UA) that is a specialized media server or
      collector that acts as the sink of the recorded media.  An SRS is
      a logical function that typically archives media for extended
      durations of time and provides interfaces for search and retrieval
      of the archived media.  An SRS is typically implemented as a
      multi-port device that is capable of receiving media from several
      sources simultaneously.  An SRS is typically also the sink of the
      recorded session metadata.

   Session Recording Client (SRC)  A Session Recording Client (SRC) is a
      SIP User Agent (UA) that acts as the source of the recorded media,
      sending it to the SRS.  An SRC is a logical function.  Its
      capabilities may be implemented across one or more physical
      devices.  In practice, an SRC could be a personal device (such as
      a SIP phone), a SIP Media Gateway (MG), a Session Border
      Controller (SBC) or a SIP Media Server (MS) integrated with an

      Application Server (AS).  This specification defines the term SRC
      such that all such SIP entities can be generically addressed under
      one definition.  The SRC itself or another entity working on its
      behalf (such as a SIP Application Server) may act as the source of
      the recording metadata.

   Communication Session (CS)  A session created between two or more SIP
      User Agents (UAs) that is the target for recording.

   Recording Session (RS)  The SIP session created between an SRC and
      SRS for the purpose of recording a Communication Session.

   Metadata  Information that describes recorded media and the CS to
      which they relate.

   Session Recording Protocol  The set of SIP extensions that supports
      recording of Communication Sessions.

   Pause during a Communication Session:  The action of temporarily
      discontinuing the transmission and collection of RS media.

   Resume during a Communication Session:  The action of recommencing
      the transmission and collection of RS media.

   Figure 1 shows the relationship between the defintions.

3.  Scope

   The scope of the Session Recording Protocol includes the
   establishment of the recording sessions and the reporting of the
   metadata.  The following items, which is not an exhaustive list, do
   not represent the protcol itself and are considered out of the scope
   of the Session Recording Protocol:

   o  Recording policies that determine whether the CS should be
      recorded

   o  Retention policies that determine how long a recording is stored

   o  Searching and accessing the recorded media and metadata

   o  Delivering recording session metadata through non-SIP mechanism


4.  Overview of operations

   This section is informative and provides a description of recording
   operations.

   As mentioned in the architecture document
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-architecture], there are a couple of types of call
   flows based on the location of the Session Recording Client.  The
   following sample call flows provide a quick overview of the
   operations between the SRC and the SRS.

4.1.  Delivering recorded media

   When the SRC is deployed as a B2BUA, the SRC can route call requests
   from UA(A) to UA(B).  As a SIP B2BUA, the SRC has access to the media
   path between the user agents.  When the SRC is aware that it should
   be recording the conversation, the SRC may bridge the media between
   UA(A) and UA(B).  The SRC then establishes the Recording Session with
   the SRS and sends replicated media towards the SRS.

   An endpoint can also be acting as the SRC, and the endpoint itself
   will be establishing the Recording Session to the SRS.  Since the
   endpoint has access to the media in the Communication Session, the
   endpoint can send replicated media towards the SRS.

   The following is a sample call flow that shows the SRC establishing a

Internet-Draft         Session Recording Protocol               May 2011


   recording session towards the SRS.  The call flow is essentially
   identical when the SRC is a B2BUA or as the endpoint itself.  Note
   that the SRC can choose when to establish the Recording Session
   independent of the Communication Session, even though the following
   call flow suggests that the Recording Session is esbalished after the
   Communication Session is estbablished.

4.2.  Conference focus as an SRC

   A conference focus may also act as an SRC since it has access to all
   the media from each conference participant.  In this example, a user
   agent may REFER the conference focus to the SRS, and the SRC may
   choose to mix media streams from all participants as a single media
   stream towards the SRS.  In order to tell the conference focus to
   start a recording session to the SRS, the user agent can include the
   srs feature tag in the Refer-To header as per [RFC4508].

4.3.  Delivering recording metadata

   Certain metadata, such as the attributes of the recorded media
   stream, are already included in the SDP of the recording session.
   This information is reused as part of the metadata.  The SRC may
   provide an initial metadata snapshot about recorded media streams in
   the initial INVITE content in the recording session.  Subsequent
   metadata updates can be represented as a stream of events in UPDATE
   or reINVITE requests sent by the SRC.  These metadata updates are
   normally incremental updates to the initial metadata snapshot to
   optimize on the size of updates, however, the SRC may also decide to
   send a new metadata snapshot anytime.

   The SRS also has the ability to sent a request to the SRC to request
   to receive a new metadata snapshot update when the SRS fails to
   understand the current stream of incremental updates for whatever
   reason (ie.  SRS gets a syntax/semantic error in metadata update, the
   SRS crashes and restarts), and the SRS may attach a reason along with
   the snapshot request.  This request allows both SRC and SRS to
   restart the states with a new metadata snapshot so that further
   metadata incremental updates will be based on the latest metadata

   snapshot.  Similar to the metadata content, the metadata snapshot
   request is transported as content in UPDATE or INVITE sent by the SRS
   in the recording session.

   In some cases session metadata can be conveyed through non-SIP
   mechanism such as HTTP or JTAPI.  These non-SIP mechanisms are
   considered out of the scope of the Session Recording Protocol,
   however, it is envisoned that a link with a URI can be provided in
   the recording session INVITE message so that the SRS can access the
   session metadata via the URI provided that the SRS supports the type
   of URI.


5.  SIP Extensions for Recording Session

   The following sections describe SIP extensions for the Recording
   Session.

   The From header must contain the identity of the SRC.  Participants
   information is not recorded in the From or To header; they are
   included in the metadata information.

   Note that a recording session does not have to live within the scope
   of a single communication session.  As outline in REQ-005 of
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-req], the recording session can be established in
   the absence of a communication session.  In this case, the SRC must
   offer an SDP with zero m= lines.

   Note that a recording session does not have to live within the scope

   the absence of a communication session.  In this case, the SRC must
   offer an SDP with zero m= lines.

   Recorded media from multiple communication sessions may be handled in
   a single recording session.  The SRC provides a reference of each
   recorded media stream to the metadata described in the next section.

5.1.  Callee Capabilities Extensions for SIP Recording

   This section discusses how the callee capabilities defined in
   [RFC3840] can be extended for SIP call recording.

   SIP Callee Capabilities defines feature tags which are used to
   represent characteristics and capabilities of a UA.  From RFC 3840:

      "Capability and characteristic information about a UA is carried
      as parameters of the Contact header field.  These parameters can
      be used within REGISTER requests and responses, OPTIONS responses,
      and requests and responses that create dialogs (such as INVITE)."

   Note that feature tags are also used in dialog modifying requests and
   responses such as re-INVITE and responses to a re-INVITE, and UPDATE.
   The 'isfocus' feature tag, defined in [RFC4579] is similar
   semantically to this case: it indicates that the UA is acting as a
   SIP conference focus, and is performing a specific action (mixing) on
   the resulting media stream.  This information is available from
   OPTIONS queries, dialog package notifications, and the SIP
   registration event package.

   We propose the definition of two new feature tags: 'src' and 'srs'.

5.1.1.  src Feature Tag

   The 'src' feature tag is used in Contact URIs by the Session
   Recording Client (SRC) related to recording sessions.  A Session



Portman, et al.         Expires November 4, 2011                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         Session Recording Protocol               May 2011


   Recording Server uses the presence of this feature tag in dialog
   creating and modifying requests and responses to confirm that the
   dialog being created is for the purpose of a Recording Session.  In
   addition, a registrar could discover that a UA is an SRC based on the
   presence of this feature tag in a registration.  Other SIP Recording
   extensions and behaviors can be triggered by the presence of this
   feature tag.

   Note that we could use a single feature tag, such as 'recording' used
   by either an SRC or SRS to identify that the session is a recording
   session.  However, due to the differences in functionality and
   behavior between an SRC and SRS, using only one feature tag for both
   is not ideal.  For instance, if a routing mistake resulted in a
   request from a SRC being routed back to another SRC, if only one
   feature tag were defined, they would not know right away about the
   error and could become confused.  With separate feature tags, they
   would realize the error immediately and terminate the session.  Also,
   call logs would clearly show the routing error.

5.1.2.  srs Feature Tag

   The 'srs' feature tag is used in Contact URIs by the Session
   Recording Server (SRS) related to recording sessions.  A Session
   Recording Client uses the presence of this feature tag in dialog
   creating and modifying requests and responses to confirm that the
   dialog being created is for the purpose of a Recording Session
   (REQ-30).  In addition, a registrar could discover that a UA is an
   SRS based on the presence of this feature tag in a registration.
   Other SIP Recording extensions and behaviors can be triggered by the
   presence of this feature tag.

   To ensure a recording session is redirected to an SRS, an SRC can
   utilize the SIP Caller Preferences extensions, defined in [RFC3841].
   The presence of a Accept-Contact: *;sip.srs allows a UA to request
   that the INVITE be routed to an SRS.  Note that to be completely
   sure, the SRC would need to include a Require: prefs header field
   field in the request.

5.2.  SDP handling

   Following the SDP offer/answer model in [RFC3264], this section
   describes the conventions used in the recording session for SDP
   handling.

   SRC can include one or more media streams to the SRS.  The SRS must
   respond with the same number of media descriptors in the SDP body of
   the 200 OK.




Portman, et al.         Expires November 4, 2011               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         Session Recording Protocol               May 2011


   The SRC should use a=sendonly attribute as the SRC does not expect to
   receive media from the SRS.  As SRS only receives RTP streams from
   SRC, the 200 OK response will normally contain SDP with a=recvonly
   attribute.

   Since the SRC may send recorded media of different participants (or
   even mixed streams) to the SRS, the SDP must provide a label on each
   media stream in order to identify the recorded stream with the rest
   of the metadata.  The a=label attribute [RFC4574] will be used to
   identify each recorded media stream, and the label name will be used
   as the reference for the metadata.  Note that a participant may have
   multiple streams (audio and video) and each stream is labeled
   separately.

   reINVITE and set the port to zero in the m= line.

   The format of the full metadata will be described as part of the
   mechanism in [I-D.ram-siprec-metadata-format].

   As mentioned in the previous section, the SDP of the recording
   session is the metadata for all recorded media streams.  The label
   attribute contains a reference to the rest of the metadata
   information.

   For all basic metadata information such as communication session,
   participants, call identifiers and direction, they can be included in
   the initial INVITE request sent by the SRC.  Metadata can be included
   as content in the INVITE or UPDATE request.  A new "disposition-type"
   of Content-Disposition is defined for this purpose and the value is
   "recording-session".

         Figure 8: Sample INVITE request for the recording session


   Further updates to recording metadata can be deliverd as a sequence
   events reported in SIP UPDATE or reINVITE requests and the SRS must
   receive the sequence of events in order.  Since there can only be a
   single INVITE or UPDATE transaction happening at a time within a SIP
   dialog, using sequence number CSeq in the dialog can be a reliable
   way for the SRS to identify the receipt of the next metadata update.

   At any time during Recording Session, the SRC may send a new metadata
   snapshot in SIP UPDATE or reINVITE request.  All subsequent metadata
   updates will be based on the new metadata snapshot.

5.4.1.  Requesting for metadata snapshot

   The SRS may send a request for metadata snapshot any time after the
   Recording Session has been established.  Similar to delivering
   metadata, the SRS sends the metadata snapshot request as content in
   UPDATE or INVITE requests or responses.  The same disposition type
   "recording-session" is used to note that the content represents
   content sent by the SRS.  The format of the metadata snapshot request
   is described in [I-D.ietf-siprec-metadata].

   The SRS should include the reason why a metadata snapshot request is
   being made to the SRC.  Typically, the SRS sends such as request in
   the case where the SRS is failing to process further metadata
   incremental updates.  Failure scenarios can include failure to parse
   metadata information (syntax error), failure to match metadata
   information with the current metadata snapshot (semantic error), or
   failure at the SRS.

   When the SRC receives the request for a metadata snapshot, the SRC
   may provide the metadata snapshot in the response or as a separate
   INVITE/UPDATE transaction.  All subsequent metadata updates sent by
   the SRC MUST be based on the new metadata snapshot.

5.4.2.  Recording Pause and Resume

   To temporarily discontinue streaming and collection of recorded media
   from the SRC to the SRS, the SRC must send a reINVITE and set
   a=inactive for each recorded media stream to be paused.

   To resume streaming and collection of recorded media, the SRC must
   send a reINVITE and set a=sendonly for each recorded media stream to
   resume.

   Note that when a media stream in the CS is muted/unmuted, this

Internet-Draft         Session Recording Protocol               May 2011


   information may be conveyed in the metadata by the SRC.  The SRC
   should not modify the recorded media stream with a=inactive for mute
   since this operation is reserved for pausing the RS media.


6.  SIP Extensions for Recording-aware User Agents

   The following sections describe SIP extensions for recording-aware
   UA.

6.1.  Providing recording indication

   While there are existing mechanisms for providing an indication that
   a CS is being recorded, these mechanisms are usually delivered on the
   CS media streams such as playing an in-band tone or an announcement
   to the participants.  A new SDP attribute is introduced to allow a
   recording-aware UA to render recording indication at the user
   interface.

   The 'record' SDP attribute appears at the media level, and may appear
   in either SDP offer or answer.  The recording indication applies to
   the specified media stream only, for example, the audio portion of
   the call may be recorded in a audio/video call.  The following is the
   ABNF of the 'record' attribute:

      record-attr = "a=record:" indication

      indication = "on" / "off" / "paused"

   on Recording is in progress.

   off  No recording is in progress.

   paused  Recording is in progress by media is paused.

6.2.  Recording awareness

   A recording-aware UA may indicate that it can accept reporting of
   recording indication in media level SDP provided in the previous
   section.  A new option tag "record-aware" is introduced to indicate
   such awareness.

   When a user agent inserts a Supported header field with the option
   tag record-aware, the UAS may provide recording indications through
   the media level SDP.  The UAS may also at the same time provide
   recording indications through traditional means such as playing a
   tone inband.

Internet-Draft         Session Recording Protocol               May 2011


   When a user agent inserts a Require header field with the option tag
   record-aware, the UAS MUST only provide recording indications through
   the media level SDP.

6.3.  Recording preference

   A recording-aware UA involved in a CS may request the CS to be
   recorded or not recorded.  This indication of recording preference
   may be sent at session establishment time or during the session.

   A new SDP attribute "recordpref" is introduced.  The SDP attribute
   appears at the media level and can only appear in an SDP offer.  The
   recording indication applies to the specified media stream only.  The
   following is the ABNF of the recordpref attribute:

      recordpref-attr = "a=recordpref:" pref

      pref = "on" / "off" / "pause"

   on Request for recording if it has not already been started.  If the
      recording is currently paused, request to resume recording.

   off  Request for no recording.  If recording has already been
      started, then this preference indicates a request to stop
      recording.

   pause  Request to pause recording if recording is currently in
      progress.


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  New Content-Disposition Parameter Registrations

   This document registers a new "disposition-type" value in Content-
   Disposition header: recording-session.

   recording-session the body describes the metadata information about
   the recording session

7.2.  Media Type Registration

7.2.1.  Registration of MIME Type application/rs-metadata

   This document registers the application/rs-metadata MIME media type
   in order to describe the recording session metadata.  This media type
   is defined by the following information:

Internet-Draft         Session Recording Protocol               May 2011


   Media type name: application

   Media subtype name: rs-metadata

   Required parameters: none

   Options parameters: none

7.2.2.  Registration of MIME Type application/rs-metadata-request

   This document registers the application/rs-metadata-request MIME
   media type in order to describe a recording session metadata snapshot
   request.  This media type is defined by the following information:

   Media type name: application

   Media subtype name: rs-metadata-request

   Required parameters: none

   Options parameters: none

7.3.  Registration of record-aware Option Tag

   This document registers the "record-aware" option tag.

   Name: record-aware

   Description: This option tag is to indicate the ability for the user
   agent to receive recording indicators in media level SDP.  When
   present in a Supported header, it indicates that the UA can receive
   recording indicators in media level SDP.  When present in a Require
   header, it indicates that the UAS MUST send all recording indicators
   through media level SDP only and not through inband media.

7.4.  SDP Attributes

   This document registers the following new SDP attributes.

7.4.1.  'record' SDP Attribute

   Attribute name: record

   Long form attribute name: Recording Indication

   Type of attribute: media level

   Subject to charset: no

Internet-Draft         Session Recording Protocol               May 2011


   This attribute provides the recording indication for the session or
   media stream.

   Allowed attribute values: on, off, paused

7.4.2.  'recordpref' SDP Attribute

   Attribute name: recordpref

   Long form attribute name: Recording Preference

   Type of attribute: media level

   Subject to charset: no

   This attribute provides the recording indication for the session or
   media stream.

   Allowed attribute values: on, off, pause


8.  Security Considerations

   The recording session is fundamentally a standard SIP dialog
   [RFC3261], therefore, the recording session can reuse any of the
   existing SIP security mechanism available for securing the recorded
   media as well as metadata.

8.1.  Authentication and Authorization

   The recording session reuses the SIP mechanism to challenge requests
   that is based on HTTP authentication.  The mechanism relies on 401
   and 407 SIP responses as well as other SIP header fields for carrying
   challenges and credentials.

   The SRS may have its own set of recording policies to authorize
   recording requests from the SRC.  The use of recording policies is
   outside the scope of the Session Recording Protocol.
