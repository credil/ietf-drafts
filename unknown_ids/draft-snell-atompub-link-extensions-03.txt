1.  Introduction

   This specification adds additional attribute to the Atom Syndication
   Format [RFC4287] link and content elements that may be used to
   express additional metadata about linked resources.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119]

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

    "atom": "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"


3.  The 'md5' attribute

   The 'md5' Attribute specifies a MD5 digest [RFC1864] of the resource
   identified by the atom:link/@href or atom:content/@src attributes.
   The value is represented as a sequence of 32 hexadecimal digits.  The
   'md5' attribute MAY appear as a child of the atom:link and atom:
   content elements.

     md5 = attribute md5 { md5-digest }
     md5-digest   = <hex of 128 bit MD5 digest as per RFC 1864>

   An example MD5 digest of an enclosed MP3 file:

     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
       href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
       md5="9e107d9d372bb6826bd81d3542a419d6" />

   The MD5 digest is computed based on the content of the entity-body as
   specified by Section 14.15 of [RFC2616].


4.  The 'etag' attribute

   The 'etag' Attribute specifies an Entity Tag [RFC2616] for the
   resource identified by the atom:link or atom:content element.  The
   'etag' attribute MAY appear as a child of the atom:link and atom:
   content elements.

Internet-Draft            Atom Link Extensions                  May 2010


     etag = attribute le:etag { entity-tag }

     entity-tag = [ weak ] opaque-tag
     weak       = "W/"
     opaque-tag = quoted-string

   An example Entity Tag for an enclosed MP3 file:

     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
        href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
        etag="W/xyzzy" />


5.  The 'modified' attribute

   The 'modified' Attribute specifies the date and time when the
   resource identified by the atom:link or atom:content element was last
   modified.  The value MUST conform to the "date-time" production
   defined by [RFC3339].  An uppercase "T" character MUST be used to
   separate date and time, and an uppercase "Z" character MUST be
   present in the absence of a numeric time zone offset.  The 'modified'
   attribute MAY appear as a child of the atom:link and atom:content
   elements.

     modified = attribute modified { xsd:dateTime }

   An example last-modified attribute for an enclosed MP3 file:

     <atom:link rel="enclosure"
       href="http://example.org/media/myfile.mp3"
       modified="2010-12-12T12:12:12Z" />


6.  Security Considerations

   TBD


7.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are required by this document.
