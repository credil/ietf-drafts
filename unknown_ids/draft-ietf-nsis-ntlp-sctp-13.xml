		<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
			<t> This document describes the usage of the General Internet
				Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp"/> and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) 
<xref target="RFC4347"/> over
				the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) <xref target="RFC4960"/>.</t>
			
			<t> GIST, in its initial specification for connection mode
				operation, runs on top of a byte-stream oriented transport
				protocol providing a reliable, in-sequence delivery, i.e., using
				the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <xref target="RFC0793"/>
				for signaling message transport. However, some Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) <xref target="RFC4080"/> context
				information has a definite lifetime, therefore, the GIST transport
				protocol could benefit from flexible retransmission, so stale NSLP
				messages that are held up by congestion can be dropped. Together
				with the head-of-line blocking and multihoming issues with TCP,
				these considerations argue that implementations of GIST should
				support SCTP
				as an optional transport protocol for GIST. Like TCP, SCTP supports reliability, congestion
				control and fragmentation. Unlike TCP, SCTP provides a number of
				functions that are desirable for signaling transport, such as
				multiple streams and multiple IP addresses for path failure
				recovery. Furthermore,   SCTP offers an advantage of message-oriented transport instead of
     using the byte stream oriented TCP where one has to provide its own
     framing mechanisms. In addition, its Partial Reliability extension (PR-SCTP) <xref target="RFC3758"/>
				supports partial retransmission based on a programmable
				retransmission timer. Furthermore, DTLS provides a viable solution for securing SCTP <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-dtls-for-sctp"/>, which allows SCTP to use almost all its transport features and its extensions.
			</t>
			
			<t> This document defines the use of SCTP as the underlying transport protocol for GIST and the use of DTLS as a security mechanism for protecting GIST Messaging Associations
				and discusses the implications on GIST state maintenance and API between GIST and NSLPs. 
      Furthermore, this document describes how GIST is transported over
 SCTP and used by NSLPs in order to exploit the
      additional capabilities offered by SCTP to deliver GIST C-mode
 messages more effectively. More

when appropriate. In addition, SCTP implementions to transport GIST MUST support

		<section title="GIST Over SCTP">
					<t>This section defines a new MA-Protocol-ID type, "Forwards-SCTP", 
                       for using SCTP as GIST transport protocol. The use of DTLS in GIST is defined in Section 7.
                    </t>
			<section title="Message Association Setup">
				<section title="Overview">
					<t>The basic GIST protocol specification defines two possible 
						protocols to be used in Messaging Associations, namely Forwards-TCP and
						TLS. This information is a main part of the Stack Configuration Data (SCD) <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp"/>. 
                       This section adds "Forwards-SCTP" as another possible protocol option. 
						In Forwards-SCTP, analog to Forwards-TCP, connections between peers are opened 
						in the forwards direction, from the querying node, towards the responder. 
					</t>

				</section>
				
				<section title="Protocol-Definition: Forwards-SCTP">
					<t>The MA-Protocol-ID "Forwards-SCTP" denotes a basic use of SCTP between peers.
				 	   Support for this protocol is OPTIONAL. If this protocol is offered,
					   MA-protocol-options data MUST also be carried in the SCD object. The
					   MA-protocol-options field formats are:
						<list style="symbols">
							<t>in a Query: no information apart from the field header.</t>
							<t>in a Response: 2 byte port number at which the connection will be
						       accepted, followed by 2 pad bytes.</t>
						</list>
					</t>
					<t>The connection is opened in the forwards direction, from the querying
					   node towards the responder. The querying node MAY use any source
					   address and source port. The destination for establishing the message
                                           association MUST be derived
					   from information in the Response: the address from the interface-
					   address from the Network-Layer-Information object and the port from
					   the SCD object as described above.
	   				</t>
	   				
	   				<t>Associations using Forwards-SCTP can carry messages with the transfer
					   attribute Reliable=True. If an error occurs on the SCTP connection
					   such as a reset, as can be reported by an SCTP socket API notification<xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket"/>, GIST MUST report this to NSLPs as discussed in
					   Section 4.1.2 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp"/>. For the multi-homing scenario, when a destination address of a GIST over SCTP peer encounters a change, the SCTP API will notify GIST about the availability of different SCTP endpoint addresses and possible change of the primary path. 					</t>
	   		
				</section>
			</section>
			
			<section title="Effect on GIST State Maintenance">
				<t>As SCTP provides additional functionality
					over TCP, this section discusses the implications of using GIST over SCTP
					on GIST State Maintenance.
				</t>
				
				<t>While SCTP defines uni-directional streams, for the purpose of this document,
				   the concept of a bi-directional stream is used. Implementations MUST establish
				   downstream and upstream (uni-directional) SCTP streams always together and use the same stream
				   identifier in both directions. Thus, the two uni-directional streams (in opposite directions) 
				   form a bi-directional stream.
				</t>
					
				<t> Due to the multi-streaming support of SCTP, it is possible to use different 
					SCTP streams for different resources (e.g., different NSLP sessions), rather than maintaining
					all messages along the same transport connection/association
					in a correlated fashion as TCP (which imposes strict (re)ordering and
					reliability per transport level). However, there are limitations to the
					use of multi-streaming.
					When an SCTP implementation is used for GIST transport, all GIST messages for a particular session MUST be sent over 
					the same SCTP stream to assure the NSLP assumption of in-order delivery.
					Multiple sessions MAY share the same SCTP stream based on local policy.
				</t>
				
				<t>The GIST concept of Messaging Association re-use is not affected by this document 
					or the use of SCTP. All rules defined in the GIST specification remain valid in the
					context of GIST over SCTP.
				</t>
				
			</section>
			
			<section anchor="pr-sctp" title="PR-SCTP Support"> 
				
				<t>A variant of SCTP, PR-SCTP <xref target="RFC3758"/> provides a 
					"timed reliability" service, which would be particularly useful for delivering 
                                        GIST Connection mode messages. 
                                       It allows the user to specify, on a per
					message basis, the rules governing how persistent the transport
					service should be in attempting to send the message to the
					receiver. Because of the chunk bundling function of SCTP, reliable and
					partially reliable messages can be multiplexed over a single PR-SCTP
					association.  Therefore, an SCTP implementation for GIST transport SHOULD
					attempt to establish a PR-SCTP association using "timed reliability" service instead of a standard SCTP
					association, if available, to support more flexible transport features
					for potential needs of different NSLPs.  
				</t>
<t>When using a normally reliable session (as opposed to a partially reliable session), if a node has sent the first transmission before the lifetime
   expires, then the message MUST be sent as a normal reliable message.
  During episodes of congestion this is particularly unfortunate, as
   retransmission wastes bandwidth that could have been used for other
   (non-lifetime expired) messages. The "timed reliability" service in PR-SCTP eliminates this issue and is hence RECOMMENDED to be used for GIST over PR-SCTP.
</t>

			<section title="API between GIST and NSLP">
				<t>GIST specification defines an abstract API between GIST and NSLPs. While this document does			not change the API itself, the semantics of some parameters have slightly different
					interpretation in the context of SCTP. This section only lists those primitives and
					parameters, that need special consideration when used in the context of SCTP.
					The relevant primitives from <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp"/> are as follows: 
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>The Timeout parameter in API "SendMessage": 
According to <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp"/>, this parameter represents the "length of time GIST should attempt to send this message
      before indicating an error." When used with PR-SCTP, this parameter
				is used as the timeout for the "timed reliability" service of PR-SCTP. 
					</t>
				<t> "NetworkNotification": According to <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp"/>, this primitive "is passed from GIST to a signalling application. It indicates that a network event of possible interest to the signalling
   application occurred." Here, if SCTP detects a failure of the primary path,  
GIST SHOULD also indicate this event to the NSLP by calling this primitive with Network-Notification-Type "Routing Status Change". This notification should be done even if SCTP was able to retain an open connection to the peer due to its multi-homing capabilities. </t>

		<section title="Application of GIST over SCTP">
			<section title="Multi-homing support of SCTP">
				<t>In general, the multi-homing support of SCTP can be used to improve fault-tolerance in case of a
				   path- or link-failure. Thus, GIST over SCTP would be able to deliver NSLP messages between peers
				   even if the primary path is not working anymore. However, for the Message Routing Methods (MRMs) defined
				   in the basic GIST specification such a feature is only of limited use. The default MRM is 
				   path-coupled, which means, that if the primary path is failing for the SCTP association, it
				   most likely is also for the IP traffic that is signaled for. Thus, GIST would need to perform
				   a refresh to the NSIS nodes to the alternative path anyway to cope with the route change. When the two endpoints of a multi-homed SCTP association (but none of the intermediate nodes between them) 
                   support NSIS, GIST over SCTP provides a robust means for GIST to deliver NSLP messages even when the primary path fails but at least one alternative path between these (NSIS-enabled) endpoints of the multihomed path is available.
Additionally, the use of the multi-homing 
				   support of SCTP provides GIST and the NSLP with another source to detect route changes. 
				   Furthermore, for the time between detection of the route change and recovering from it, the
				   alternative path offered by SCTP can be used by the NSLP to make the transition more smoothly.
				   Finally, future MRMs might have different properties and therefore benefit from multi-homing
				   more broadly.
				</t>
			</section>
                <section title="Streaming support in SCTP">
		<t>Streaming support in SCTP is advantageous for GIST. It allows better parallel processing, in particular by avoiding head of line blocking issue in TCP. Since a same GIST MA may be reused by multiple sessions, using TCP as transport for GIST signaling messages belonging to different sessions may be blocked if another message is dropped. In the case of SCTP, this can be avoided as different sessions having different requirements can belong to different streams, thus a
message loss or reordering in a stream will only affect the delivery of messages within that particular stream, and not
any other streams. </t>
</section>
<!-- This could also be used for local policy, how stream distribution should be done.

			- Partial reliability can be used, whenever a message has a limited lifetime. We should analyze how this
			  interferes with NSLP protocol specification (if they do not state a limited lifetime, should an application
			  decide this on its own?). The question is important, as messages might be important for state machine transitions or
			  refreshing of some state, etc. The question which message really has a limited lifetime might be non trivial for
			  the implementor.
			- Multi-homing support for GIST message associations is only of limited use. The basic MRM defined for GIST is the
			  path-coupled one. Whenever the primary SCTP path fails, and thus multi-homing in terms of failure-recovery is
			  relevant, the IP path faces a failure too. Thus GIST might not be path-coupled anymore, and a GIST refresh
			  needs to be performed. This might change the next peer. Thus, multi-homing is of limited use, however, it might
			  make the transition between old and new path more smooth. 
			  Thats why an SCTP path failure should be reported to the NSLP (see API section). SCTP can therefore be used as 
			  an additional source to detect path changes. 
			- Multi-homing support in general could be used for e.g. load balancing. However, this is currently not supported by
			  the SCTP specification. Correct?
			  
			Any further benefits of SCTP we claim to be present?
			Do we want to present any specially highlighted scenario? I think this discussion should be sufficient.

<t>NAT traversal for GIST over SCTP will follow Section 7.2 of  <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp"/> and the GIST extensibility capabilities defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ext"/>.

		<section title="Use of DTLS with GIST">
<t>This section specifies a new MA-Protocol-ID "DTLS" for the use of DTLS in GIST, which denotes a basic use of datagram transport layer channel
   security, initially in conjunction with GIST over SCTP.  It provides server (i.e., GIST transport receiver) authentication and integrity (as long as the NULL
cipher suite is not selected during cipher suite negotiation), as well as optionally 
replay protection for control packets. The use of DTLS for securing GIST over SCTP allows GIST to take 
the advantage of features provided by SCTP and its extensions. The usage of DTLS for GIST over SCTP 
is similar to TLS for GIST as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp"/>, where a stack-proposal containing 
both MA-Protocol-IDs for SCTP and DTLS during the GIST handshake phase. </t>

<t>  The usage of DTLS <xref target="RFC4347"/> for securing GIST over datagram transport protocols MUST be implemented and SHOULD be 
used. </t>

<t>   GIST message associations using DTLS may carry messages with transfer attributes requesting
   confidentiality or integrity protection. The specific DTLS version
   will be negotiated within the DTLS layer itself, but implementations
   MUST NOT negotiate to protocol versions prior to DTLS v1.0 and MUST
   use the highest protocol version supported by both peers. GIST nodes 
   supporting DTLS MUST be able to negotiate the DTLS
   NULL and block ciphers and SHOULD be able to negotiate the
   new cipher suites.  They MAY negotiate any
   mutually acceptable ciphersuite that provides authentication,
   integrity, and confidentiality. The same rules for negotiating TLS cipher suites 
   as specified in  Section  5.7.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp"/> apply. </t>
   <t>DTLS renegotiation <xref target="RFC5746"/> may cause problems for applications such
   that connection security parameters can change without the application
   knowing it. Hence, it is RECOMMENDED that renegotiation be
   disabled for GIST over DTLS.</t>

<t>   No MA-protocol-options field is required for DTLS. The configuration information for the transport protocol
   over which DTLS is running (e.g.  SCTP port number) is provided by the
   MA-protocol-options for that protocol.
