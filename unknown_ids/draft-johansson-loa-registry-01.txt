Internet-Draft            SAML 2.0 LoA Registry               April 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document establishes an IANA registry for Level of Assurance
   Context Profiles for SAML 2.0.  Such objects are XML schema
   definitions that fulfil the requirements of sstc-saml-loa-
   authncontext-profile-draft-01
   [OASIS.sstc.saml-loa-authncontext-profile-draft-01].  Quoting from
   this specification we find the following definition of the concept of
   level of assurance:

   _Many existing (and potential) SAML federation deployments have
   adopted a "levels of assurance" (or LOA) model for categorizing the
   wide variety of authentication methods into a small number of levels,
   typically based on some notion of the strength of the authentication.
   Federation members (service providers or "relying parties") then
   decide which level of assurance is required to access specific
   protected resources, based on some assessment of "value" or "risk"._

   Several so called trust frameworks and identity federations now
   exist, some of which define one or more LoAs.  The purpose of this
   specification is to create an IANA registry where such LoA
   definitions can be discovered.

   Although the registry will contain URIs that reference SAML
   Authentication Context Profiles other protocols MAY use such URIs to
   represent levels of assurance definitions without relying on their
   SAML XML definitions.  Use of the registry by protocols other than
   SAML is encouraged.


2.  Name of Registry

   The name of the registry shall be "SAML 2.0 LoA Context Class", in
   plural "SAML LoA Context Classes".  The term LoA is an abbreviation
   of Level of Assurance.


3.  Registration Template

   The following information MUST be provided with each registration:

   URI:  A URI referencing a SAML 2.0 LoA Context Class.  This is the
      registry key.

   Context Class:  A valid XML schema definition for the SAML 2.0 LoA
      Context Class fulfilling the requirements of sstc-saml-loa-
      authncontext-profile-draft-01
      [OASIS.sstc.saml-loa-authncontext-profile-draft-01].

Internet-Draft            SAML 2.0 LoA Registry               April 2011


   Informational URL:  A URL containing auxilliary information.  This
      URL MUST minimally reference contact information for the
      administrative authority of the level of assurance definition.

   Note that it is not uncommon for a single XML Schema to contain
   definitions of multiple URIs.  In that case the registration MUST be
   repeated for each URI.  Since the registry key (the URI) is unique by
   design there is no need for namespace management for this registry.


4.  Registration Policy

   The registry is to be operated under the "Designated Expert Review"
   policy from RFC5226 [RFC5226] employing a pool of experts.  IANA is
   kindly asked to do rough randomized load-balancing among the experts.
   The initial pool of expert and the review criteria are outlined
   below.

4.1.  Reviewer Expectations

   The of the IANA LoA Registry is that it contain bona fide SAML 2.0
   LoA Context Class definitions while not presenting a very high bar
   for entry.  Expert reviewers SHOULD NOT place undue value in any
   percieved or actual quality of the associated trust framework or
   federation and SHOULD only exclude such registrations that in the
   view of the experts do not represent bona fide attempts at defining
   an LoA.

   The designated experts are also expected to verify that the
   registration is consistent and that the provided XML fulfills the
   requirements of sstc-saml-loa-authncontext-profile-draft-01
   [OASIS.sstc.saml-loa-authncontext-profile-draft-01].

4.2.  Designated Experts Pool

   TBD


5.  Registry Semantics

   The intended use for this registry is to serve as a basis for
   discovery of LoA definitions that might for instance be used by SAML
   management tools.  Consumers of the registry MUST NOT treat it as a
   complete list of all existing LoA definitions and MUST provide a way
   for the user to provide additional LoA Context Class definitions by
   other means.  It is not expected that all LoA definitions will be
   contained in this registry.

   The presense of an entry in the registy MUST NOT be taken to imply
   any semantics beyond the review done by the expert reviewers as part
   of the registration process.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document sets up a registry with IANA making the whole document
   a set of considerations for IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   An implementor of MUST NOT treat the registry as a trust framework or
   federation and MUST NOT make any assumptions about the properties of
   any of the listed level of assurance URIs or their associated trust
   frameworks or federations based on their presense in the IANA
   registry.


8.  Acknowledgements

   Bob 'RL' Morgan, Scott Cantor, Lucy Lynch and John Bradley were
   involved in the initial discussions around this idea and contributed
   to the semantics of the registry.


9.  Changes

   Note to the RFC editor: This section should be removed before
   publication.

9.1.  since -00

   o  Clarified the security considerations wrt the status of the IANA
      registry.

   o  Text in the introduction that explains that the registry can be
      used by other protocols than SAML and that this is encouraged.
