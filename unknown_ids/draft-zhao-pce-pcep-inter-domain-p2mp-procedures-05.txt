  PCE-based Computation Procedure To Compute Shortest Constrained P2MP
         Inter-domain Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths
          draft-zhao-pce-pcep-inter-domain-p2mp-procedures-05

Abstract

   The ability to compute paths for constrained point-to-multipoint
   (P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths(TE LSPs) across
   multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement for the
   deployment of P2MP services in MPLS and GMPLS networks.  The Path
   Computation Element (PCE) has been recognized as an appropriate
   technology for the determination of inter-domain paths of P2MP TE
   LSPs.

   This document describes the procedures and extensions to the PCE
   communication Protocol (PCEP) to handle requests and responses for
   the computation of inter-domain paths for P2MP TE LSPs.

Internet-Draft            PCEP P2MP Procedures                 July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Multicast services are increasingly in demand for high-capacity
   applications such as multicast Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), IP-
   television (IPTV) which may be on-demand or streamed, and content-
   rich media distribution (for example, software distribution,
   financial streaming, or data-sharing).  The ability to compute
   constrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) for
   point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs in Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains.
   A domain can be defined as a collection of network elements within a
   common sphere of address management or path computational
   responsibility such as an IGP area or an Autonomous Systems.

   The applicability of the Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] for
   the computation of such paths is discussed in [RFC5671], and the
   requirements placed on the PCE communications Protocol (PCEP) for
   this are given in [PCE-P2MP-REQ].

   This document describes how multiple PCE techniques can be combined
   to address the requirements.  These mechanisms include the use of the
   per-domain path computation technique specified in [RFC5152],
   extensions to the backward recursive path computation (BRPC)
   technique specified in [RFC5441] for P2MP LSP path computation in an
   inter-domain environment, and a new procedure for core-tree based
   path computation defined in this document.  These three mechanisms
   are suitable for different environments (topologies, administrative
   domains, policies, service requirements, etc.) and can also be
   effectively combined.

3.  Problem Statement

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph, and applying computational constraints.  A Path
   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
   computed.

   [RFC4875] describes how to set up P2MP TE LSPs for use in MPLS and
   GMPLS networks.  The PCE is identified as a suitable application for
   the computation of paths for P2MP TE LSPs [RFC5671].

   [RFC5441] specifies a procedure relying on the use of multiple PCEs
   to compute (P2P) inter-domain constrained shortest paths across a
   predetermined sequence of domains, using a backward recursive path
   computation technique.  The technique can be combined with the use of
   path keys [RFC5520] to preserve confidentiality across domains, which
   is sometimes required when domains are managed by different Service
   Providers.

   The PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] is extended for
   point-to-multipoint(P2MP) path computation requests and in [PCE-P2MP-
   EXT].  However, that specification does not provide all the necessary
   mechanisms to request the computation of inter-domain P2MP TE LSPs.

   As discussed in [RFC4461], a P2MP tree is a graphical representation
   of all TE links that are committed for a particular P2MP LSP.  In
   other words, a P2MP tree is a representation of the corresponding
   P2MP tunnel on the TE network topology.  A sub-tree is a part of the
   P2MP tree describing how the root or an intermediate P2MP LSPs
   minimizes packet duplication when P2P TE sub-LSPs traverse common
   links.  As described in [RFC5671] the computation of a P2MP tree
   requires three major pieces of information.  The first is the path
   from the ingress LSR of a P2MP LSP to each of the egress LSRs, the
   second is the traffic engineering related parameters, and the third
   is the branch capability information.

   Generally, an inter-domain P2MP tree (i.e., a P2MP tree with source
   and at least one destination residing in different domains) is
   particularly difficult to compute even for a distributed PCE
   architecture.  For instance, while the BRPC recursive path
   computation may be well-suited for P2P paths, P2MP path computation
   involves multiple branching path segments from the source to the
   multiple destinations.  As such, inter-domain P2MP path computation
   may result in a plurality of per-domain path options that may be
   difficult to coordinate efficiently and effectively between domains.
   That is, when one or more domains have multiple ingress and/or egress
   border nodes, there is currently no known technique for one domain to
   determine which border routers another domain will utilize for the
   inter-domain P2MP tree, and no way to limit the computation of the
   P2MP tree to those utilized border nodes.

   A trivial solution to the computation of inter-domain P2MP tree would
   be to compute shortest inter-domain P2P paths from source to each
   destination and then combine them to generate an inter-domain,
   shortest-path-to-destination P2MP tree.  This solution, however,
   cannot be used to trade cost to destination for overall tree cost
   (i.e., it cannot produce a Steiner tree) and in the context of inter-
   domain P2MP LSPs it cannot be used to reduce the number of domain
   border nodes that are transited.

   Computing P2P LSPs individually is not an acceptable solution for
   computing a P2MP tree.  Even per domain path computation [RFC5152]
   can be used to compute P2P multi-domain paths, but it does not
   guarantee to find the optimal path which crosses multiple domains.
   Furthermore, constructing a P2MP tree from individual source to leaf
   P2P LSPs does not guarantee to produce a least-cost tree.  This
   approach may also be considered to have scaling issues during LSP
   setup.  That is, the LSP to each leaf is signaled separately, and
   each border node must perform path computation for each leaf.

   Apart from path computation difficulties faced due to the inter-
   domain topology visibility issues, the computation of the minimum

   P2MP Steiner tree, i.e. one which guarantees the least cost resulting
   tree, is an NP-complete problem.  Moreover, adding and/or removing a
   single destination to/from the tree may result in an entirely
   different tree.  In this case, the frequent Steiner I tree
   computation process may prove computationally intensive, and the
   resulting frequent tunnel reconfiguration may even cause network
   destabilization.  There are several heuristic algorithms presented in
   the literature that approximate the result within polynomial time
   that are applicable within the context of a single-domain.

   This document presents a solution, and procedures and extensions to
   PCEP to support P2MP inter-domain path computation.


4.  Assumptions

   It is assumed that due to deployment and commercial limitations
   (e.g., inter-AS peering agreements) the sequence of domains for a
   path (the path domain tree) will be known in advance.

   The examples and scenarios used in this document are also based on
   the following assumptions:

   o  The PCE that serves each domain in the path domain tree is known,
      and the set of PCEs and their relationships is propagated to each
      PCE during the first exchange of path computation requests;

   o  Each PCE knows about any leaf LSRs in the domain it serves;

   o  The boundary nodes to use on the LSP are pre-determined and form
      path of the path domain tree.  In this version of the document we
      do not consider multi-homed domains.

   Additional assumptions are documented in [RFC5441] and will not be
   repeated here.


5.  Requirements

   This section summarizes the requirements specific to computing inter-
   domain P2MP paths.  In these requirements we note that the actual
   computation times by any PCE implementation are outside the scope of
   this document, but we observe that reducing the complexity of the
   required computations has a beneficial effect on the computation time
   regardless of implementation.  Additionally, reducing the number of
   message exchanges and the amount of information exchanged will reduce
   the overall computation time for the entire P2MP tree.  We refer to
   the "Complexity of the computation" as the impact on these aspects of

   path computation time as various parameters of the topology and the
   P2MP LSP are changed.

   Its also important that the solution preserves confidentiality across
   domains, which is required when domains are managed by different
   Service Providers.

   Other than the requirements specified in [RFC5376], a number of
   requirements specific to P2MP are detailed below:

   1.  The computed P2MP LSP should be optimal when only considering the
       paths among the BNs.

   2.  Grafting and pruning of multicast destinations in a domain should
       have no impact on other domains and on the paths among BNs.

   3.  The complexity of the computation for each sub-tree within each
       domain should be dependent only on the topology of the domain and
       it should be independent of the domain sequence.

   4.  The number of PCEP request and reply messages should be
       independent of the number of multicast destinations in each
       domain.

   5.  Specifying the domain entry and exit nodes.

   6.  Specifying which nodes should be used as branch nodes.

   7.  Reoptimization of existing sub-trees.

   8.  Computation of P2MP paths that need to be diverse from existing
       P2MP paths.


6.  Object Functions

   During the computation of a single or a set of P2MP TE LSPs a request
   to meet specific optimization criteria, called an Objective Function
   (OF), may be requested.

   The computation of one or more P2MP TE-LSPs maybe subject to an OF in
   order to select the "best" candidate paths.  A variety of objective
   functions have been identified as being important during the
   computation of inter-domain P2MP LSPs.  These are:

   1.  The sub-tree within each domain should be optimized, which can be
       either the Minimum cost tree [PCE-P2MP-REQ] or Shortest path tree
       [PCE-P2MP-REQ].

Internet-Draft            PCEP P2MP Procedures                 July 2010


   2.  The P2MP LSP paths should be optimal while only considering the
       entry and exit nodes of each domain as the transit, branch and
       leaf nodes of the P2MP LSP path.  (That is, the Core Tree should
       be optimized.)

   3.  It should be possible to limit the number of entry points to a
       domain.

   4.  It should be possible to force the branches for all leaves within
       a domain to be in that domain.


7.  P2MP Path Computation Procedures

   The following sections describe the core tree based procedures to
   satisfy the requirements specified in the previous section.

   A core tree based solution provides an optimal inter-domain P2MP TE
   LSP and meets the requirements and OFs outlined in previous sections.

   A core tree is a path tree with nodes from each domain corresponding
   to the PCE topology which satisfies the following conditions:

   o  The root of the core tree is the ingress LSR in the root domain;

   o  The leaf of the core tree is the entry node in the leaf domain;

   o  The transit and branch nodes of the core tree are from the entry
      and exit nodes from the transit and branch domains.

   Procedure Phase 1: Build the P2MP LSP Core Tree.

   In this phase, the core tree, where the root is the ingress LSR, the
   transit node and branch node are the BNs of the transit domains and
   the leaf nodes are the leaf BNs of the leaf domains, is computed.

   Procedure Phase 2: Grafting destinations to the P2MP LSP Core Tree.

   Once the core tree is built, the grafting of all the leaf nodes from
   each domain to the core tree can be achieved by a number of
   algorithms.  One algorithm for doing this phase is that the root PCE
   will send the request with C bit set for the path computation to the
   destination(s) directly to the PCE where the destination(s) belong(s)
   along with the core tree computed from the phase 1.

7.1.  Core Tree Computation Procedures

   Computing the complete P2MP LSP path tree is done in two phases:

   The algorithms to compute the optimal large core tree are outside
   scope of this document.  In the case that the number of domains and
   the number of BNs are not big, the following extended BRPC based
   procedure can be used to compute the core tree.

   BRPC Based Core Tree Path Computation Procedure:

   1.  Using the BRPC procedures to compute the VSPT(i) for each leaf
       BN(i), i=1 to n, where n is the total number of entry nodes for
       all the leaf domains.  In each VSPT(i), there are a number of
       P(i) paths.

   2.  When the root PCE has computed all the VSPT(i), i=1 to n, take
       one path from each VSPT and form a set of paths, we call it a
       PathSet(j), j=1 to M, where M=P(1)xP(2)...xP(n);

   3.  For each PathSet(j), there are n S2L (Source to Leaf BN) paths
       and form these n paths into a Core Tree(j);

   4.  There will be M number of Core Trees computed from step3.  Apply
       the OF to each of these M Core Trees and find the optimal Core
       Tree.

7.2.  Sub Tree Computation Procedures

   The algorithms to compute the optimal large sub tree are outside
   scope of this document.  In the case that the number of destinations
   and the number of BNs within a domain are not big, the incremental
   procedure based on p2p path computation usign the OSPF can be used.

7.3.  PCEP Protocol Extensions

7.3.1.  The Extension of RP Object

   The extended format of the RP object body to include the C bit is as
   follows:

   The C bit is added in the flag bits field of the RP object to signal
   the receiver of the message that the request/reply is for inter-
   domain P2MP Core Tree or not.

   The following flag is added in this draft:

   C bit ( P2MP Core Tree bit - 1 bit):

      0: This indicates that this is normal PCReq/PCRrep for P2MP.

      1: This indicates that this is PCReq or PCRep message for inter-
      domain Core Tree P2MP.  When the C bit is set, then the request
      message should have the Core Tree passed along with the
      destinations which and then graphed to the tree.

7.3.2.  The PCE Sequence Object

   The PCE Sequence Object is added to the existing PCE protocol.  A
   list of this objects will represent the PCE topology tree.  A list of
   Sequence Objects can be exchanged between PCEs during the PCE
   capability exchange or on the first path computation request message
   between PCEs.  In this case, the request message format needs to be
   changed to include the list of PCE Sequence Objects for the PCE
   inter-domain P2MP calculation request.

   Each PCE Sequence can be obtained from the domain sequence for a
   specific path.  All the PCE sequences for all the paths of P2MP
   inter-domain form the PCE Topology Tree of the P2MP LSP.

   The format of the new PCE Sequence Object for IPv4 (Object-Type 3) is
   as follows:

8.  Manageability Considerations

   [PCE-P2MP-REQ] describes various manageability requirements in
   support of P2MP path computation when applying PCEP.  This section
   describes how manageability requirements mentioned in [PCE-P2MP-REQ]
   are supported in the context of PCEP extensions specified in this
   document.

   Note that [RFC5440] describes various manageability considerations in
   PCEP, and most of manageability requirements mentioned in [PCE-P2MP
   P2MP] are already covered there.


9.  Control of Function and Policy

   In addition to configuration parameters listed in [RFC5440], the
   following parameters MAY be required.

   o  P2MP path computations enabled or disabled.

   o  Advertisement of P2MP path computation capability enabled or
      disabled (discovery protocol, capability exchange).


10.  Information and Data Models

   As described in [PCE-P2MP-REQ], MIB objects MUST be supported for
   PCEP extensions specified in this document.


11.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   There are no additional considerations beyond those expressed in
   [RFC5440], since [PCE-P2MP-REQ] does not address any additional
   requirements.


12.  Verifying Correct Operation

   There are no additional considerations beyond those expressed in
   [RFC5440], since [PCE-P2MP-REQ] does not address any additional
   requirements.


13.  Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components

   As described in [PCE-P2MP-REQ], the PCE MUST obtain information about
   the P2MP signaling and branching capabilities of each LSR in the

   network.

   Protocol extensions specified in this document does not provide such
   capability.  Other mechanisms MUST be present.


14.  Impact on Network Operation

   It is expected that use of PCEP extensions specified in this document
   will not have significant impact on network operations.


15.  Security Considerations

   As described in [PCE-P2MP-REQ], P2MP path computation requests are
   more CPU-intensive and also use more link bandwidth.  Therefore, it
   may be more vulnerable to denial of service attacks.  Therefore, it
   is more important that implementations conform to security
   requirements of [RFC5440], and the implementer utilize those security
   features.


16.  IANA Considerations

   A new flag of the RP object (specified in [RFC5440]) is defined in
   this document.

   TBD.
