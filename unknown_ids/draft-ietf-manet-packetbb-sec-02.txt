                    draft-ietf-manet-packetbb-sec-02

Abstract

   This document describes general and flexible TLVs (type-length-value
   structure) for representing cryptographic signatures as well as
   timestamps, using the generalized MANET packet/message format
   [RFC5444].  It defines two Packet TLVs, two Message TLVs, and two
   Address Block TLVs, for affixing cryptographic signatures and
   timestamps to a packet, message and address, respectively.

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV     November 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies:

   o  two TLVs for carrying cryptographic signatures and timestamps in
      packets, messages and address blocks as defined by [RFC5444],

   o  how cryptographic signatures are calculated, taking (for Message
      TLVs) into account the mutable message header fields (<msg-hop-
      limit> and <msg-hop-count>) where these fields are present in
      messages.

   This document requests from IANA:

   o  allocations for these Packet, Message, and Address Block TLVs from
      the 0-223 Packet TLV range, the 0-127 Message TLV range and the
      0-127 Address Block TLV range from [RFC5444],

   o  creation of two IANA registries for recording code points for hash
      function and signature calculation, respectively.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology and notation defined in [RFC5444].


3.  Applicability Statement

   MANET routing protocols using the format defined in [RFC5444] are
   accorded the ability to carry additional information in control
   messages and packets, through inclusion of TLVs.  Information so
   included MAY be used by a routing protocol, or by an extension of a
   routing protocol, according to its specification.

   This document specifies how to include a cryptographic signature for
   a packet, message or address by way of such TLVs.  This document also
   specifies how to treat "mutable" fields (<msg-hop-count> and <msg-
   hop-limit>), if present, in the message header when calculating
   signatures, such that the resulting signature can be correctly
   verified by any recipient, and how to include this signature.

4.  Security Architecture

   Basic MANET routing protocol specifications are often "oblivious to
   security", however have a clause allowing a control message to be
   rejected as "badly formed" prior to it being processed or forwarded.
   Protocols such as [NHDP] and [OLSRv2] recognize external reasons
   (such as failure to verify a signature) for rejecting a message as
   "badly formed", and therefore "invalid for processing".  This
   architecture is a result of the observation that with respect to
   security in MANETs, "one size rarely fits all" and that MANET routing
   protocol deployment domains have varying security requirements
   ranging from "unbreakable" to "virtually none".  The virtue of this
   approach is that MANET routing protocol specifications (and
   implementations) can remain "generic", with extensions providing
   proper deployment-domain specific security mechanisms.

   The MANET routing protocol "security architecture", in which this
   specification situates itself, can therefore be summarized as
   follows:

   o  Security-oblivious MANET routing protocol specifications, with a
      clause allowing an extension to reject a message (prior to
      processing/forwarding) as "badly formed".

   o  MANET routing protocol security extensions, rejecting messages as
      "badly formed", as appropriate for a given deployment-domain
      specific security requirement.

   o  Code-points and an exchange format for information, necessary for
      specification of such MANET routing protocol security extensions.

   This document addresses the last of these issues, by specifying a
   common exchange format for cryptographic signatures, making
   reservations from within the Packet TLV, Message TLV and Address
   Block TLV registries of [RFC5444], to be used (and shared) among
   MANET routing protocol security extensions, establishing two IANA
   registries for code-points for hash functions and cryptographic
   functions adhering to [RFC5444].

   With respect to [RFC5444], this document:

   o  is intended to be used in the non-normative, but intended, mode of
      use of [RFC5444] as described in its Appendix B.

   o  is a specific example of the Security Considerations section of
      [RFC5444] (the authentication part).

5.  Protocol Overview and Functioning

   This specification does not describe a protocol, nor does it mandate
   specific router or protocol behavior.  It represents a purely
   syntactical representation of security related information for use
   with [RFC5444] addresses, messages and packets, as well as
   establishes IANA registrations and registries.


6.  Imported TLV Fields

   In this specification, the following TLV fields from [RFC5444] are
   used:

   <msg-hop-limit>  - hop limit of a message, as specified in Section
      5.2 of [RFC5444].

   <msg-hop-count>  - hop count of a message, as specified in Section
      5.2 of [RFC5444].

   <length>  - length of a TLV in octets, as specified in Section 5.4.1
      of [RFC5444].


7.  General Signature TLV Structure

   The following data structure allows representation of a cryptographic
   signature, including specification of the appropriate hash function
   and cryptographic function used for calculating the signature.  This
   <signature> data structure is specified, using the regular expression
   syntax of [RFC5444], as:

             <signature> := <hash-function>
                            <cryptographic-function>
                            <key-index>
                            <signature-value>

   where:

   <hash-function>  is an 8-bit unsigned integer field specifying the
      hash function.

   <cryptographic-function>  is an 8-bit unsigned integer field
      specifying the cryptographic function.

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV     November 2010


   <key-index>  is an 8-bit unsigned integer field specifying the key
      index of the key which was used to sign the message, which allows
      unique identification of different keys with the same originator.
      It is the responsibility of each key originator to make sure that
      actively used keys that it issues have distinct key indices and
      that all key indices have a value unequal to 0x00.  Value 0x00 is
      reserved for a pre-installed, shared key.

   <signature-value>  is an unsigned integer field, whose length is
      <length> - 3, and which contains the cryptographic signature.

   The basic version of this TLV assumes that calculating the signature
   can be decomposed into:

      signature-value = cryptographic-function(hash-function(content))

   The hash function and the cryptographic function correspond to the
   entries in two IANA registries, set up by this specification in
   Section 12.

7.1.  Rationale

   The rationale for separating the hash function and the cryptographic
   function into two octets instead of having all combinations in a
   single octet - possibly as TLV type extension - is twofold: First, if
   further hash functions or cryptographic functions are added in the
   future, the number space might not remain continuous.  More
   importantly, the number space of possible combinations would be
   rapidly exhausted.  As new or improved cryptographic mechanism are
   continuously being developed and introduced, this format should be
   able to accommodate such for the foreseeable future.

   The rationale for not including a field that lists parameters of the
   cryptographic signature in the TLV is, that before being able to
   validate a cryptographic signature, routers have to exchange or
   acquire keys (e.g. public keys).  Any additional parameters can be
   provided together with the keys in that bootstrap process.  It is
   therefore not necessary, and would even entail an extra overhead, to
   transmit the parameters within every message.  One inherently
   included parameter is the length of the signature, which is <length>
   - 3 and which depends on the choice of the cryptographic function.


8.  General Timestamp TLV Structure

   The following data structure allows the representation of a
   timestamp.  This <timestamp> data structure is specified as:




Herberg & Clausen         Expires May 15, 2011                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV     November 2010


          <timestamp> := <time-value>

   where:

   <time-value>  is an unsigned integer field, whose length is <length>,
      and which contains the timestamp.  The value of this variable is
      to be interpreted by the routing protocol as specified by the type
      extension of the Timestamp TLV, see Section 12.

   A timestamp is essentially "freshness information".  As such, its
   setting and interpretation is to be determined by the routing
   protocol (or the extension to a routing protocol) that uses it, and
   may e.g. correspond to a UNIX-timestamp, GPS timestamp or a simple
   sequence number.


9.  Packet TLVs

   Two Packet TLVs are defined, for including the cryptographic
   signature of a packet, and for including the timestamp indicating the
   time at which the cryptographic signature was calculated.

9.1.  Packet SIGNATURE TLV

   A Packet SIGNATURE TLV is an example of a Signature TLV as described
   in Section 7.  When calculating the <signature-value> for a Packet,
   the signature is calculated over the three fields <hash-function>,
   <cryptographic-function> and <key-index> (in that order),
   concatenated with the entire Packet, including the packet header, all
   Packet TLVs (other than Packet SIGNATURE TLVs) and all included
   Messages and their message headers.

   The following considerations apply:

   o  As packets defined in [RFC5444] are never forwarded by routers, it
      is unnecessary to consider mutable fields (e.g. <msg-hop-count>
      and <msg-hop-limit>), if present, when calculating the signature.

   o  any Packet SIGNATURE TLVs already present in the Packet TLV block
      MUST be removed before calculating the signature, and the Packet
      TLV block size MUST be recalculated accordingly.  The TLVs can be
      restored after having calculated the signature value.

   The rationale for removing any Packet SIGNATURE TLV already present
   prior to calculating the signature, is that several signatures may be
   added to the same packet, e.g., using different signature functions.

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV     November 2010


9.2.  Packet TIMESTAMP TLV

   A Packet TIMESTAMP TLV is an example of a Timestamp TLV as described
   in Section 8.  If a packet contains a TIMESTAMP TLV and a SIGNATURE
   TLV, the TIMESTAMP TLV SHOULD be added to the packet before any
   SIGNATURE TLV, in order that it be included in the calculation of the
   signature.


10.  Message TLVs

   Two Message TLVs are defined, for including the cryptographic
   signature of a message, and for including the timestamp indicating
   the time at which the cryptographic signature was calculated.

10.1.  Message SIGNATURE TLV

   A Message SIGNATURE TLV is an example of a Signature TLV as described
   in Section 7.  When determining the <signature-value> for a message,
   the signature is calculated over the three fields <hash-function>,
   <cryptographic-function>, and <key-index> (in that order),
   concatenated with the entire message with the following
   considerations:

   o  the fields <msg-hop-limit> and <msg-hop-count>, if present, MUST
      both be assumed to have the value 0 (zero) when calculating the
      signature.

   o  any Message SIGNATURE TLVs already present in the Message TLV
      block MUST be removed before calculating the signature, and the
      message size as well as the Message TLV block size MUST be
      recalculated accordingly.  The TLVs can be restored after having
      calculated the signature value.

   The rationale for removing any Message SIGNATURE TLV already present
   prior to calculating the signature, is that several signatures may be
   added to the same message, e.g., using different signature functions.

10.2.  Message TIMESTAMP TLV

   A Message TIMESTAMP TLV is an example of a Timestamp TLV as described
   in Section 8.  If a message contains a TIMESTAMP TLV and a SIGNATURE
   TLV, the TIMESTAMP TLV SHOULD be added to the message before the
   SIGNATURE TLV, in order that it be included in the calculation of the
   signature.

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV     November 2010


11.  Address Block TLVs

   Two Address Block TLVs are defined, for associating a cryptographic
   signature to an address, and for including the timestamp indicating
   the time at which the cryptographic signature was calculated.

11.1.  Address Block SIGNATURE TLV

   An Address Block SIGNATURE TLV is an example of a Signature TLV as
   described in Section 7.  The signature is calculated over the three
   fields <hash-function>, <cryptographic-function>, and <key-index> (in
   that order), concatenated with the address, concatenated with any
   other values, for example, any other TLV value that is associated
   with that address.  A routing protocol or routing protocol extension
   using Address Block SIGNATURE TLVs MUST specify how to include any
   such concatenated attribute of the address in the verification
   process of the signature.

11.2.  Address Block TIMESTAMP TLV

   An Address Block TIMESTAMP TLV is an example of a Timestamp TLV as
   described in Section 8.  If both a TIMESTAMP TLV and a SIGNATURE TLV
   are associated with an address, the timestamp value should be
   considered when calculating the value of the signature.


12.  IANA Considerations

   This section specifies requests to IANA.

12.1.  TLV Registrations

   This specification defines:

   o  two Packet TLV types which must be allocated from the 0-223 range
      of the "Assigned Packet TLV Types" repository of [RFC5444] as
      specified in Table 1,

   o  two Message TLV types which must be allocated from the 0-127 range
      of the "Assigned Message TLV Types" repository of [RFC5444] as
      specified in Table 2,

   o  and two Address Block TLV types which must be allocated from the
      0-127 range of the "Assigned Address Block TLV Types" repository
      of [RFC5444] as specified in Table 3.

   This specification requests:

Internet-Draft     MANET Cryptographical Signature TLV     November 2010


   o  set up of type extension registries for these TLV types.

   IANA is requested to assign the same numerical value to the Packet
   TLV, Message TLV and Address Block TLV types with the same name.

12.1.1.  Expert Review: Evaluation Guidelines

   For the registries for TLV type extensions where an Expert Review is
   required, the designated expert SHOULD take the same general
   recommendations into consideration as are specified by [RFC5444].

   For the Timestamp TLV, the same type extensions for all Packet,
   Message and Address TLVs should be numbered identically.

12.1.2.  Packet TLV Type Registrations

   The Packet TLVs as specified in Table 1 must be allocated from the
   "Packet TLV Types" namespace of [RFC5444].

12.2.  New IANA Registries

   This document introduces three namespaces that have been registered:
   Packet TLV Types, Message TLV Types, and Address Block TLV Types.
   This section specifies IANA registries for these namespaces and
   provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
   regarding registrations in these namespaces.

   The following terms are used with the meanings defined in [BCP26]:
   "Namespace", "Assigned Value", "Registration", "Unassigned",

   "Reserved", "Hierarchical Allocation", and "Designated Expert".

   The following policies are used with the meanings defined in [BCP26]:
   "Private Use", "Expert Review", and "Standards Action".

12.2.1.  Expert Review: Evaluation Guidelines

   For the registries for the following tables where an Expert Review is
   required, the designated expert SHOULD take the same general
   recommendations into consideration as are specified by [RFC5444].

12.2.2.  Hash Function

   IANA is requested to create a new registry for the hash functions
   that can be used when creating a signature.  The initial assignments
   and allocation policies are specified in Table 4.

   +-------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+
   |     Hash    | Algorithm |               Description               |

13.  Security Considerations

   This document does not specify a protocol itself.  However, it
   provides a syntactical component for cryptographic signatures of
   messages and packets as defined in [RFC5444].  It can be used to
   address security issues of a protocol or extension that uses the
   component specified in this document.  As such, it has the same
   security considerations as [RFC5444].

   In addition, a protocol that includes this component MUST specify the
   usage as well as the security that is attained by the cryptographic
   signatures of a message or a packet.

   As an example, a routing protocol that uses this component to reject
   "badly formed" messages if a control message does not contain a valid
   signature, should indicate the security assumption that if the
   signature is valid, the message is considered valid.  It also should
   indicate the security issues that are counteracted by this measure
   (e.g. link or identity spoofing) as well as the issues that are not
   counteracted (e.g. compromised keys).


14.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Jerome Milan (Ecole Polytechnique)
   for his advice as cryptographer.  In addition, many thanks to Bo
   Berry (Cisco), Alan Cullen (BAE), Justin Dean (NRL), Christopher
   Dearlove (BAE), Paul Lambert (Marvell), and Henning Rogge (FGAN) for
