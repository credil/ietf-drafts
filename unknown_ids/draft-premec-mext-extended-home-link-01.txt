1. Introduction  

   In some deployments of the Mobile IPv6 Support for Dual Stack Hosts 
   and Routers (DSMIP6) [Sol2008] there may be a need for the IPv6-only 
   home link while at the same time allowing the MN attached to its 
   IPv6-only home link to communicate with IPv4 peers. The operator's

   decision to offer only IPv6 service on the home link can be a result 
   of the shortage of the public IPv4 addresses or because the operator 
   wants to save the additional costs of operating a dual stack network. 

   DSMIP6 [Sol2008] does not allow the MN to maintain a binding with the 
   HA for its IPv4 home address while being attached to the IPv6-only 
   home link. This document specifies protocol semantics to allow the 
   DSMIP6 protocol to support the usage of the IPv4 home address from 
   the IPv6-only home link. A MN attached to an IPv6-only home link is 
   allowed to register its IPv6 home address as a care-of address for 
   its IPv4 home address. In such configuration there is no tunneling 
   overhead for the IPv6 traffic and the MN is able to tunnel IPv4 
   datagrams using the IPv4 home address over the IPv6 home address. 

   Section 3 of this specification discusses the envisioned deployment 
   scenarios in more detail. 

   Section 4 describes how a DSMIP6-enabled MN that is attached to a 
   foreign network returns to the IPv6-only home link while maintaining 
   the IPv4 connectivity.  

   Section 5 provides detailed requirements for MN and HA/LMA.

   provides only IPv6 connectivity. In one scenario the HA is co-located

   with the default router, and the MN's home link is configured to 
   support only the IPv6. However, the HA has connectivity to both IPv4 
   and IPv6 internet on its northbound interface. Since the HA is a full 
   fledged DSMIP6 HA, it can provide IPv4 home address and IPv4 
   connectivity service to the MN. In this case the IPv4 home link 
   appears as a virtual home link to the MN and the MN tunnels the IPv4 
   datagrams via its on-link IPv6 address to the HA. As the MN is IPv6-
   wise at home, there is no tunnel overhead for the IPv6 traffic. This 
   configuration is shown in the figure 1:

   access networks are able to carry only IPv6 datagrams.

           Figure 2 PMIPv6 domain with IPv6-only access networks 

   In the figure 2 the home network consists of the access network AN1 
   and the HA/LMA. Home network is fully capable dual stack network. The 
   HA/LMA located in the core network is connected to the IPv4/IPv6 
   internet. The complete transport path from the MN through the access 
   network AN1 to the HA/LMA supports native IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity. 

   In addition to the native access network AN1, there could be several 
   other access networks that connect to the MN's core network. Some of 
   those additional access networks may support only IPv6 on the 
   interface facing the MN. In addition, those access networks may be 
   interconnected to the MN's core network by means of PMIPv6 protocol 
   [RFC5213]. In this case, PMIPv6 is used to emulate the MN's home link 
   while the MN is attached through the non-native access network. In 
   the figure 2 the access network AN2 provides only IPv6 connectivity. 
   When the MN attaches through AN2, its only on-link address is its 
   IPv6 home address emulated by PMIPv6 and any IPv4 traffic must be 
   tunneled by the MN to the HA/LMA via a DSMIP6 tunnel.

4. Solution Overview 

   This document enhances the DSMIP6 protocol [Sol2008] to allow a MN 
   that is attached to its home link to register its IPv6 on-link home 
   address as a care-of address for its IPv4 home address. As a result 
   there is no tunnel overhead for the traffic using the MN's IPv6 on-
   link home address and the MN is able to obtain connectivity for its 
   IPv4 home address by tunneling the packets via its IPv6 home address. 

   This specification does not introduce any new protocol elements to 
   the DSMIP6 protocol, instead it defines an additional semantics for 
   some specific combinations of the home address and care-of address 
   options.  

4.1. Registration process on the home link 

   Assume a MN has been configured with the following three addresses: 

       v6HoA  MN's IPv6 home address 
       v4HoA  MN's IPv4 home address 
       v6HA   HA's IPv6 address 

   and currently is located in an IPv6 foreign network using 

       v6CoA  MN's IPv6 care-of address 

   The MN has, using DSMIP6, already made a registration with the HA for 
   both of its home addresses. 

   When the MN returns home to an IPv6-only home network, the MN sends 
   the following packet in order to register its on-link IPv6 address as 
   the care-of address for the IPv4 home address. The usage of the 
   alternate care-of address option while on the home link is optional 
   and hence it may be omitted: 

       IPv6 Header (src = v6HoA, dst = v6HA) 
       ESP Header 
       Mobility Header 
           type = 5 (Binding Update) 
           lifetime non-zero 
           Alternate Care-of Address option (v6HoA) 
           IPv4 Home Address option (v4HoA) 

   The HA sends the following response: 

       IPv6 Header (src = v6HA, dst = v6HoA) 
       ESP Header

Internet-Draft    Extended DSMIP6 home link support          March 2009 
    

       Mobility Header  
           type = 6 (Binding Acknowledgement) 
           lifetime non-zero 
           IPv4 Address Acknowledgement option (v4HoA) 

   Although the packet exchange specified above appears obvious, the 
   packet exchange modifies the normal semantics of bindings in two 
   ways. 

   First, according to RFC 3775 section 9.5, the home agent when 
   processing the binding update will determine the specified care-of 
   address to be the address found in the Alternate Care-of Address 
   option, i.e. v6HoA, or detect that the Alternate Care-of Address 
   option was omitted. Further it will determine the home address to be 
   the source address of the IPv6 header, i.e. v6HoA. With this input, 
   the home agent will conclude the binding update is a deregistration, 
   even if lifetime is non-zero. When a DSMIP6 home agent detects a 
   deregistration of the IPv6 home address, it releases the entries for 
   both the IPv6 and IPv4 home addresses. Therefore, this draft changes 
   the normal semantics of deletion of an entry in the binding cache as 
   it requires that only the IPv6 entry is removed.  

   Another point relates to the deregistration of the IPv4 home address 
   from the IPv6-only home link. Suppose the mobile node has installed 
   the entry 

                   v4HoA -> v6HoA 

   in the binding cache.  Assume the mobile node no longer wants IPv4 
   connectivity, and wants to clear the cache entry.  The mobile node 
   will clear the entry by sending, see DSMIP section 5.4.2.1, a binding 
   update message with a lifetime of zero. This message is sent using 
   v6HoA as source address.  However, the binding cache has no v6HoA 
   entry.  This means the entry in the binding cache cannot be found and 
   cleared. 

   One way to resolve this is to mandate that the mobile node includes 
   the IPv4 home address as part of the de-registration Binding Update 
   message which is then used by the home agent to locate the 
   corresponding binding cache entry. 

   Another way to resolve this is to ensure the home agent maintains a 
   dummy entry for the v6HoA, such that the binding cache reads: 

                   v6HoA -> v6HoA 
                   v4HoA -> v6HoA

Internet-Draft    Extended DSMIP6 home link support          March 2009 
    

   Inserting such a dummy entry in order to bypass tunneling seems a 
   substantial change of semantics. This is essentially the same as the 
   concept of the home binding described in section 5.6.5 of [Wak2009]. 

   The packet exchanges above used for returning to an IPv6-only home 
   link are also used when the MN boots on the IPv6-only home link, or 
   when making a re-registration to extend the lifetime. They are also 
   to be used when it is attached to the native dual stack home network, 
   and discovers that the native IPv4 connectivity no longer works. When 
   later the MN discovers that IPv4 service is again available, the MN 
   sends a BU with lifetime set to zero. 

4.2. Registration process on the PMIPv6 emulated home link 

   Detailed description of interworking scenarios between PMIP and 
   Mobile IPv6, related issues and solution approaches is provided in 
   [Gia2008]. This section analyses a specific scenario where the BCE 
   for IPv6 home address is under the control of a MAG while the BCE for 
   the IPv4 home address is updated by the MN. Note that such scenario 
   where the IPv4 home address is under the control of a MN while IPv6 
   home address is controlled by the MAG is not considered in [Gia2008]. 

   We start with the same set of assumptions regarding the MN's current 
   location and the registration state with the HA as in section 4.1. 
   The difference is that the MN's home link is emulated by the PMIPv6 
   protocol and the LMA is collocated with the MN's HA. We assume that 
   the link between the MAG and the LMA supports IPv6 (it could be IPv4 
   as well, the link type between the MAG and the LMA does not affect 
   the discussion presented here). In addition, the MAG is configured 
   with: 

       v6PCoA   proxy care-of address of the MAG 

   Since the LMA is collocated with the HA, we shall use the v6HA as the 
   addresses of the LMA. 

   Upon the MN's attachment to the PMIPv6 emulated IPv6-only home link, 
   the MAG sends the following packet to the LMA: 

       IPv6 header (src=v6PCoA, dst=v6HA) 
         Mobility header 
            type = 5 (Binding Update, P flag set) 
            lifetime non-zero 
            Home Network Prefix option (::) 
            MN Identifier option (MN-NAI) 
            Handoff Indicator option = 1 (attach. over a new interface)

Internet-Draft    Extended DSMIP6 home link support          March 2009 
    

            Access Technology Type option 
    

   When the LMA receives the Proxy BU message it checks if there is an 
   active binding for the MN's IPv6 home address that was created by the 
   MN itself. If there is no such binding, the LMA processes the PBU 
   message as per [RFC5213]. If the binding that was created by the MN 
   is found, the HA/LMA creates a new BCE in response to the PBU and 
   marks it as a shadow BCE. The IPv6 home address in the shadow BCE is 
   the same as the IPv6 home address in the active BCE that was created 
   by the MN. The LMA responds to the MAG in the same way as if it had 
   created a regular (non-shadow) BCE. As long as there is an active BCE 
   that was created by the MN, the shadow BCE remains inactive and is 
   not used to deliver the packets to the MN. 

   This results in the following binding cache entries: 

   V4HoA -> v6CoA   updated by the MN 
   v6HoA -> v6CoA   updated by the MN 
   v6HoA -> v6PCoA  shadow, crated by the MAG 

   The LMA responds to the MAG with: 

       IPv6 header (src=v6HA, dst=v6PCoA) 
         Mobility header 
           type = 6 (Binding Acknowledgement, P flag set)  
           lifetime non-zero  
           MN Identifier option (MN-NAI) 
           Handoff Indicator option = 1 (attach. over a new interface) 
           Access Technology Type option 
           Home Network Prefix option (HNP) 

   Having acquired the MN's home network prefix, the MAG advertises it 
   to the MN. When the MN detects that it is IPv6-wise at its home link, 
   it deregisters the binding for its IPv6 home address while at the 
   same time registering the IPv6 home address as the care-of address 
   for its IPv4 home address as described in section 4.1. Upon 
   deregistration of the IPv6 home address by the MN the LMA activates 
   the shadow BCE. The resulting binding cache entries look like this: 

   V4HoA -> v6HoA   updated by the MN 
   v6HoA -> v6PCoA  updated by the MAG 

   The MN's IPv6 traffic is tunneled between the MAG and the LMA in the 
   PMIPv6 tunnel. The MN's IPv4 traffic is double tunneled: first by the 
   MN to its v6HoA and then via the PMIPv6 tunnel to the v6HA.

Internet-Draft    Extended DSMIP6 home link support          March 2009 
    

   Note that different lifetimes may be associated with the binding 
   cache entries holding the v6HoA and the v4HoA. 

5. Protocol Operation 

   This specification does not make any changes to the Mobile IP message 
   format, but it does introduce new semantics for the BU message. If 
   the lifetime in the BU message is non-zero, the IPv6 home address in 
   BU message is the same as the IPv6 care-of address and the IPv4 home 
   address option is also included, then the HA updates the BCE for the 
   IPv4 home address to include the IPv6 home address as the care-of 
   address. At the same time the BCE for the IPv6 home address is 
   deprecated. 

5.1. MN Considerations 

   When a DSMIP6-enabled MN is connected to an IPv6-only home link, it 
   MAY register its IPv6 home address as the care-of address for its 
   IPv4 home address by including the IPv4 Home address option in the BU 
   message and setting the care-of address in the BU message to its IPv6 
   home address. In this case the MN SHALL tunnel any IPv4 traffic 
   sourced from the IPv4 home address via its IPv6 home address to the 
   HA. 

   If the MN registered its IPv6 home address as a care-of address for 
   its IPv4 home address, the MN SHALL maintain a BU list entry for the 
   IPv4 home address containing the IPv6 home address as the care-of 
   address. 

5.2. HA/LMA Considerations 

   If the MN's current care-of address as received in the BU message 
   equals the MN's IPv6 home address, the HA SHALL deprecate the BCE for 
   the IPv6 home address. If the IPv4 home address was included in the 
   same BU message and the lifetime filed is non-zero, the HA SHALL 
   update the BCE for the IPv4 home address as per [Sol2008]. 

   When the MN registers its IPv6 home address as a care-of address for 
   the IPv4 home address, the HA/LMA SHALL intercept the traffic 
   destined to the MN's IPv4 home address and tunnel it to the MN's IPv6 
   home address. In case when there is a Proxy BCE for the MN's IPv6 
   home addresses, the IPv4 traffic will be double tunneled: first to 
   the MN's IPv6 home address and then to the proxy care-of address of 
   the MAG. 

   When the HA receives the BU that was sent from the IPv6-only home 
   link and where the lifetime is set to zero, the HA releases both the

   IPv6 and IPv4 BCEs. If no IPv6 BCE was found, but the BU message 
   contains the IPv4 home address, the HA SHALL use the IPv4 home 
   address from the BU message to locate the corresponding IPv4 BCE and 
   release it. 

   When the LMA receives the Proxy BU message for the MN and if there is 
   an active binding that was created by the MN for the same home 
   address as requested in the PBU, the HA/LMA creates a new BCE based 
   on the PBU message and marks it as a shadow BCE. The home address in 
   the shadow BCE is copied over from the existing BCE. The LMA responds 
   to the MAG in the same way as if it had created a regular (non-
   shadow) BCE. As long as there is an active BCE that was created by 
   the MN, the shadow BCE remains inactive. 

   The LMA SHALL activate the shadow BCE when it deprecates the 
   corresponding BCE that is updated by the MN. 

   As a general consideration, the HA/LMA SHALL NOT delete the BCE 
   immediately upon processing of a deregistration message, instead, the 
   HA/LMA SHALL mark the BCE as deprecated and start the 
   MinDelayBeforeBCEDelete timer as described in [RFC5213]. This allows 
   the HA/LMA to assign the same home address (from the deprecated BCE) 
   in cases where the deregistration message is received before the 
   registration. The HA/LMA SHALL delete the deprecated BCE after the 
   timer expiry. This consideration applies to both deregistration 
   messages sent by the MAG as well as to deregistration messages sent 
   by the MN. 

5.3. MAG Considerations 

   If MAG does not support IPv4 service on the interface facing the MN, 
   the MAG SHALL NOT include the IPv4 home address option in the Proxy 
   BU message. 

6. Security Considerations 

   This document recommends that the same level of security is applied 
   to the packets sent natively to/from the MN's on-link home address 
   and to the packets on the virtual home link that are tunneled to the 
   MN's on-link home address.  

7. IANA Considerations 

   None.
