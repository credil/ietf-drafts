Internet Draft          Naming IPv6 address parts      September 8, 2010


Abstract

   Discussing and explaining IPv6 addresses become difficult when
   different people use different terms for the same thing. This
   document tries to find a common naming scheme for the parts of an
   IPv6 address.

1. Introduction

   Verbal and written communication requires a common set of terms, eas-
   ily understood by every potential party. While deploying IPv6, when
   refering to segments of IPv6 addresses, confusion regularly arises
   due to the usage of different and sometimes conflicting nomenclature
   for the same pieces of information.

   [IPV6Addr] is the normative reference to IPv6 addressing and avoids
   to coin a special term for the subject of this document itself:
      The preferred form is x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x, where the 'x's are one to
      four hexadecimal digits of the eight 16-bit pieces of the address.

2. Rationale

   While we readily agree that the naming of IPv6 address parts is not
   the most pressing concern the Internet is facing today, a common
   nomenclature is important for efficient communication.

   In IPv6 deployments the delimiting colons are regularly used to
   facilitate the separation of labels discerning not only administra-
   tive boundaries but also network segments and distinct infrastructure
   components. Consequently the values between the colons are frequently
   refered to especially in communication regarding coordinative mat-
   ters.

   Time spent explaining what one is referring to is wasted and con-
   flicting names can lead to misunderstanding while the usage of a com-
   mon term helps facilitating quick understanding.

   To solve this problem, the specification of a precise and recogniz-
   able term is advised.

   Since parts of the internet community only accept authoritative
   advice substantiated by a published document, also known as the
   'citation needed' approach, it is helpful to have a definite source.

3. Naming Considerations

   Any term that can be confused with other technical terms due to pho-
   netic similarities can lead to misconfiguration causing reachability
   and security risks to the involved parties. Even with English being
   the preferred language in the IT world today, a good name should
   describe the technical matter precisely while being easy to remember,
   spell and pronounce in as many languages as possible.


4. Naming Proposals

   chazwazza [greg]
    - Simpsons reference
    - pro: Unique word in the scope of networking
   chunk
    - pro: Programmer slang for part of a datastream
    - con: Not unique to IPv6
   column
    - The colons make an IPv6 visual similar to a table
   doctet
    - octect is a standard term for a sequence of 8 bits,
     so 16 bits are double octet
   hexadectet
    - pro: Directly related to the "octet" known from IPv4
    - con: Hard to pronounce.
   hextet / hexatet / sixlet
    - con: Derived from six thus misleading as not six bits
          but sixteen bits are named
   hit
    - Short for "hex-bit"
   orone
    - Initially a typo in [greg]
    - pro: Unique word
   provider number, customer number, network number
    - pro: Describing the semantics of different parts of an IPv6 address
    - con: May not be the same in all deployments; can change over time

           e.g. due to AS renumbering or a change of provider
    - con: Might not be applicable in all cases, e.g. multicast addresses
    - con: Reflects only the scope chosen by the network operator,
           thus can differ from network to network
    - con: More generally: It is not within the scope of this document
           to find terms describing semantics, but rather syntactic elements
   qibble
    - Short form of quadnibble
    - pro: Easy to pronounce
   qnibble
    - Short form of quadnibble
    - con: Hard to pronounce
   quadnibble
    - A nibble is a 4bit entity; 16 bits are a quad nibble
   quibble
    - pro: Easier to spell than qibble
    - pro: Unique word in the scope of networking
   segment
    - pro: An obvious choice
    - con: Not unique to IPv6
   tuple
    - A tuple is a sequence of heterogenous elements considered
     as a new enitiy by itself
    - con: The bits are homogenous
    - con: Tuples are typically introduced to assign a different semantics
   word
    - A synonym for 16 bits on legacy x86
    - Usually refers to a fixed group of bits processed at once
    - con: Has a different meaning outside of the the tech world

5. IANA Considerations

   No assignments by the IANA are required. However it is considered
   desirable that the IANA adopts the term in future documents.

8. Acknowledgements

   Thanks go to Greg Ferro who initiated the discussion by proposing the
   term "chazwazza".[greg]

   Thanks all the people who read to this point and are willing to
   provide valuable input instead of simply shaking their heads and
   moving on.

   The inital version of this document was created following the spirit
   of [Q.6].
