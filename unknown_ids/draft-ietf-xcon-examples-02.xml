      <xref target="RFC4597"/>.  The XCON scenarios describe a broad range of use cases

      <t> Due to the broad range of functionality provided by the XCON Framework and the flexibility of 
      the CCMP messaging, these call flows should not be considered inclusive of all the functionality 
      that can provided 
      by the XCON Framework and protocol implementations.  These flows represent a sample  to
      provide an overview of the feature rich capabilities of the XCON framework and CCMP messaging for  
      protocol developers, software developers and researchers.

      This document provides a sampling of detailed call flows that can be implemented based on
      a system realization of  <xref target="RFC5239"/> and implementation of <xref target="I-D.ietf-xcon-ccmp"/>.
      This is intended to be a simple guide on the use of the conference control protocol between

      This document focuses on the
      interaction between the Conference (and Media) Control Client and the Conferencing system, specifically
      the Conference Server. The scenarios are based on those described in the XCON framework, many
      of which are based on the advanced conferencing capabilities described in the XCON scenarios.
      Additional scenarios
      have been added to provide examples of other real life scenarios that are anticipated to be supported
      by the framework.  With the exception of an initial example with media control messaging, the examples
      do not include the details for the media control <xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-mixer-control-package"/>, 
      call signaling
      or binary floor control <xref target="RFC4582"/> protocols. 
      This document
      references the scenarios in the Media Control call flows <xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-call-flows"/>, 
      SIP Call Control Conferencing <xref target="RFC4579"/>
      and binary floor control protocol documents.

	<!-- Conference Creation -->
	<section title="Conference Creation" anchor="sec-create">
    <t>
      This section provides the details associated with the various ways in which a conference can be created
      using CCMP and the XCON framework constructs.  As previously mentioned the details of the
      media control, call signaling and floor control protocols, where
      applicable, are annotated in the flows without showing all the details.
      However, for clarification purposes, the first example <xref target="sec-basic"/> provides the details of the
      media control messaging along with an
      example of the standard annotation used throughout the remainder of this document.
      In subsequent flows, only this
      annotation (identified by lower case letters) is included and the reader is encouraged to
      refer to the call flows in the relevant documents for details for the other protocols.
      The annotations for the
      call signaling are on the left side of the conferencing server vertical bar and those for the media control
      messaging are on the right side.
    </t>

    <section title="Basic Conference Creation" anchor="sec-basic">
      <t>
        The simplest manner in which a conference can be created is accomplished by the client sending
        a "confRequest" message with the "create" operation as the only parameter to the conference server,
		together with the "confUserID" associated with the requesting client itself.
        This results in the creation of a default conference, with an
        XCON-URI in the form of the "confObjID" parameter, the XCON-UserID in the form of the
        "confUserID" parameter (the same already present in the request) and
        the data for the conference object in the "confInfo" parameter all returned in the
        "confResponse" message. According to the implementation of the framework, this
        example may also add the user that invoked the conference upon creation to the
        conference object (e.g., "method" attribute in the "target" element of
        "allowed-users-list" may be set to "dial out" for this
        client based on the particular conferencing systems default). This is exactly
		the case depicted in the figure, which is presented to enrich the scenario.
        Note that, depending upon the conferencing system, this default conference could
        be specific to the client requesting the conference and thus may be different
        for the initiator than other participants (e.g., IVR interactions
        in this case which are not shown).
      </t>

      <t>
        The specific data for the conference object is returned in the
        "confResponse" message in the "confInfo"
        parameter.  This allows the client (with the appropriate authorization) 
        to manipulate this
        data and add additional participants to the conference, 
        as well as change the data during the conference.
        In addition, the client may distribute the conferencing
        information to other participants allowing them to join,
        the details of which are provided in additional
        flows.
        Please notice that, according to CCMP specification, 
        the restitution of the new conference data in the "confInfo"
        parameter is not mandatory: if the "confInfo" parameter of the successful
         confResponse/create is void, a following confRequest/retrieve of the 
         returned "confObjID" can be triggered to provide the requesting client 
         with the detailed conference description.
      </t>

      <t>
        Clients that are not XCON-aware
        may join the conference using a specific signaling interface such as SIP <xref target="RFC3261"/>,
        using the signaling
        interface to the conference focus as described in <xref target="RFC4579" />.  However, these
        details are not shown in the message flows. The message flows in this document
        identity the point in the message flows
        at which this signaling occurs via the lower case letter items (i.e., (a)...(x)) along with the
        appropriate text for the processing done by the conferencing server.

             anchor="sec-create-info">
      <t>
        A conference can also be created by the client sending a "confRequest" message
        with the "create" operation, along with the desired data in the form of the "confInfo" parameter
        for the conference to be created. The request also
		includes the "confUserID" of the requesting entity.
        If the conferencing system can support that specific type
        of conference (capabilities, etc.), then the request results in the creation of a
        conference. In this success case, an
        XCON-URI in the form of the "confObjID" parameter and the XCON-UserID in the form of the 
        "confUserID" parameter (again, the same as the requesting entity)
        are returned in the "confResponse" message.  In this example, 
        we choose not to return the created conference object in the successful 
        "confResponse" in the "confInfo" parameter.
      </t>

      <t>
        This example also activates the conference upon creation (i.e., "method" attribute is set
        to "dial out" for this client based on the particular conferencing systems default). Just as
		before, this is not to be considered mandatory, since it depends on the implementation
		choices of the framework.
        Note that, depending upon the conferencing system, this default conference could
        be specific to the client requesting the conference and thus may be different
        for the initiator than other participants (e.g., IVR interactions
        in this case which are not shown).

    <section title="Basic Conference Creation - Cloning an existing Conference" anchor="sec-create-obj">
      <t>
        A client can also create another conference by cloning an existing conference, such as an active conference
        or conference reservation.  In this example, the client sends a "confRequest" message
        with the "create" operation, along with the "confUserID" and a specific "confObjID", from which a new conference is to be
        created by cloning an existing conference.
      </t>

      <t>
        An example of how a client can create a conference based on a blueprint
        is provided in <xref target="sec-blueprint"/>.  The manner by which a client in this example might learn
        about a conference reservation or active conferences is similar to the first step in the blueprint example, with
        the exception of specifying querying for different types of conference objects supported by the specific 
        conferencing system.
        For example, in this example, the client clones a conference reservation (i.e., an inactive conference). 
      </t>


      <t>
        If the conferencing system can support a new instance of the specific type
        of conference(capabilities, etc.), then the request results in the creation of a
        conference, with an
        XCON-URI in the form of a new value in the "confObjID" parameter to reflect the newly cloned conference object
        returned in the "confResponse" message.

          "Alice" sends a confRequest message to clone a conference based on an
          existing conference reservation. "Alice" indicates this conference should be 
          cloned from the specified parent conference represented by the "confObjID" in the request.
        </t>

        <t>
          Upon receipt of the confRequest message containing a 
          "create" operation and "confObjID", the
          conferencing system ensures that the "confObjID" received is valid. 
          The
          conferencing system determines the appropriate read/write access of
          any users to be added to a conference based on this "confObjID" (using
          membership, roles, etc.). The conferencing system uses the received
          "confObjID" to clone a conference reservation. The conferencing system
          also reserves or allocates a new "confObjID" (called "confObjID*" in 
		  <xref target="fig-create-clone"/>) to be used for the cloned conference object.
		  This new identifier is of course different from the one associated with the
		  conference to be cloned, since it represents a different conference object. Any
          subsequent protocol requests from any of the members of the
          conference must address this new identifier. The conferencing system maintains the mapping between this

        "Alice" first sends a "blueprintsRequest" message to the conferencing system identified by
        the conference server discovery process.  Upon receipt of the 
        "blueprintsRequest", the conferencing system would first authenticate "Alice"
        and then
        ensure that "Alice" has the appropriate authority based on system
        policies to receive any blueprints supported by that system. 
      </t>

      <t>
        Any
        blueprint that "Alice" is authorized to use are returned in a
        "blueprintsResponse" message in the "blueprintsInfo" attribute.
      </t>

      <t> 
        Upon receipt of the "blueprintsResponse" containing
        the blueprints, "Alice" determines which blueprint to use for the
        conference to be created. "Alice" sends a "blueprintRequest" message to 
        get the specific blueprint as identified by the "confObjID". 
      </t>
      <t>The conferencing system returns the "confInfo" associated with the specific blueprint as
      identified by the 'confObjID' in the "blueprintResponse" message. 
      </t>

      <t>"Alice" then sends a "confRequest" with a 
        "create" operation to the
        conferencing system to create a conference reservation, 
        including the appropriate "blueprintName" and associated
        "confObjID". </t>

      <t>
        Upon receipt of the "confRequest" message with a "create" operation, the conferencing system uses the
        received
        blueprint to clone a conference, allocating a new "confObjID" (again called "confObjID* in the example).
		 The conferencing server then
        sends a "confResponse" message including the new "confObjID*" associated with the newly created
        conference instance.
        Upon receipt of the "confResponse" message, "Alice" can now add other users to the conference .

	<!-- Overview -->
  <section title="General Conference scenarios and examples" anchor="sec-examples">
    <t>
      The following scenarios are based on those documented in the XCON framework.
      The examples assume that a conference has already been
      correctly established, with media, if applicable, per one of the examples in
      <xref target="sec-create"/>.
    </t>
    <section title="Conference Announcements and Recordings" anchor="sec-anncrec">
      <t>
        In this example, as
        shown in <xref target="fig:annc"></xref> "Alice" is joining "Bob"'s conference that requires that she
        first enter a pass code. After successfully entering the passcode, an announcement prompts "Alice
        to speak her name so it can be recorded. When "Alice" is added to the active conference, the
        recording is played back to all the existing participants. A very similar example is presented in
		Figure 33 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-call-flows"/>.

        <t>
          Upon receipt of the userRequest from
          "Alice" to be added to "Bob's" conference (i.e., an "update" operation on "Bob's"
          conference object), the conferencing system
          determines that a password is required for this specific conference.
          Thus an announcement asking "Alice" to enter the password is provided
          to "Alice". This may be achieved by means of typical IVR fucntionality.
		  Once "Alice" enters the password, it is validated against
          the policies associated with "Bob's" active conference. The
          conferencing system then connects to a server which prompts and
          records "Alice's" name. The conferencing system must also determine
          whether "Alice" is already a user of this conferencing system or
          whether she is a new user.
          In this case, "Alice" is a new user for this conferencing system, so a conference
          user identifier is created for "Alice". Based upon the addressing
          information provided by "Alice", the call signaling to add "Alice" to
          the conference is instigated through the Focus.
        </t>

        <t> The conference server sends "Alice" a userResponse message which includes 
          the "confUserID" assigned by the
          conferencing system for "Alice". This would allow "Alice" to later perform
          operations on the conference (if she were to have the appropriate policies),
          including registering for event notifications associated with the conference.
          Once the call signaling indicates that "Alice" has been
          successfully added to the specific conference, per updates to the
          state, and depending upon the policies, other participants (e.g.,
          "Bob") are notified of the addition of "Alice" to the conference via
        the conference notification service and an announcement is provided to
        all the participants indicating that "Alice" has joined the
        conference.

    <section anchor="sec:dtmf" title="Monitoring for DTMF">
      <t>
        The conferencing system also needs the capability to monitor for
        DTMF from each individual participant. This would typically be used to
        enter the identifier and/or access code for joining a specific
        conference.
      </t>

      <t>
        An example of DTMF monitoring, within the context of the framework
        elements, is shown in <xref target="fig:annc"></xref>. A typical
		way for the conferencing system to be aware of all the DTMF interactions
		within the context of conferences it is responsible for, is making
		use of the MEDIACTRL architecture for what regards media manipulation.
		Examples in that sense (specifically for what concerns DTMF interception
		in conference instances) are presented in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mediactrl-call-flows"/>.

    <section title="Adding a Party" anchor="sec-addparty">

      <t>
        In this example, "Alice" wants to
        add "Bob" to an established conference. In the following example we assume
		"Bob" is a new user to the system, which means "Alice" also needs to provide
		details about him. In fact, the case of "Bob" already present as a user
		in the conferencing system is much easier to address, and will be
		discussed later on.

          "Alice" sends a userRequest message with an operation of "create" to
          add "Bob" to the specific conference as identified by the
          confObjID. The "create" operation also makes sure that "Bob" is created
          as a user in the whole conferencing system. This is done by adding
          a "userInfo" element describing "Bob" as a user. This is needed in
          order to let the conferencing system be aware of "Bob"'s characteristics.
          In case Bob was already a registered user, "Alice" would just have referenced him through his
          XCON UserID, without providing the additional "userInfo". In fact, that information
          (including, for instance, "Bob"'s SIP URI to be used subsequently for dial-out)
          would be obtained by referencing the extant registration.
          The conference server ensures that "Alice" has
          the appropriate authority based on the policies associated with that
          specific conference object to perform the operation.
          As mentioned before, a new Conference User Identifier is created for Bob,
          and the "userInfo" is used to update the conference object accordingly.
        </t>
        <t>
          In the presented example, the call signaling to add
          "Bob" to the conference is instigated through the Focus as well. Please
          notice that this is implementation specific. In fact, a conferencing
          system may accomplish different actions after the user creation, just
          as it may do nothing at all. Among the possible actions,
          for instance "Bob" may be added as a "target" element to the
          "allowed-users-list" element, whose joining "method" may be either
          "dial-in" or "dial-out". Besides, out-of-band notification mechanisms
          may be involved as well, e.g. to notify "Bob" via mail of the new
          conference, including details as the date, password, expected
          participants and so on.
        </t>

      </list>

      <list style="hanging">
      <t>
        To conclude the overview on this scenario, once "Bob" has been successfully
        added to the specified conference, per updates to the state, and
        depending upon the policies, other participants (including "Bob" himself) may
        be notified of the addition of "Bob" to the conference via the
        Conference Notification Service.

    <section title="Muting a Party">

      <t>
        This section provides an example of the muting of a party in an
        active conference.  The unmuting would involve the identical CCMP message
        flow. Although, in the case that floor control is involved, whether or
        not a particular conference client can unmute itself must be
        considered by the conferencing system.
      </t>

	<t>
	<list style="hanging">
	<t>
		Please notice that interaction between CCMP and floor control should
		be carefully considered. In fact, handling CCMP- and BFCP-based media
		control has to be considered as multiple layers: i.e., a
		participant may have the BFCP floor granted, but be muted by means of CCMP.
		If so, he would still be muted in the conference, and would only be unmuted if
		both the protocols allowed for this.
	</t>
	</list>

      <t>
        <xref target="fig:mute"></xref> provides an example of one client
        "Alice" impacting the media state of another client "Bob". This
        example assumes an established conference. In this example, the
        client, "Alice" whose Role is "moderator" of the conference, wants to
        mute "Bob" on a medium-size multi-party conference, as his device is
        not muted (and he's obviously not listening to the call) and
        background noise in his office environment is disruptive to the
        conference. BFCP floor control is assumed not to be involved.

        profile accordingly by means of the related protocol interaction
        with the MS. An example describing a possible way of dealing with

        of this update via the Conference Notification
        Service.

      <t>
        <xref target="fig:sidebar"></xref> provides an example of one
        client "Alice" involved in active conference with "Bob" and "Carol".
        "Alice" wants to create a sidebar to have a side discussion with
        "Bob" while still viewing the video associated with the main
        conference. Alternatively, the audio from the main conference could
        be maintained at a reduced volume. "Alice" initiates the sidebar by
        sending a request to the conferencing system to create a conference
        reservation based upon the active conference object. "Alice" and
        "Bob" would remain on the roster of the main conference, such that
        other participants could be aware of their participation in the main
        conference, while an internal-sidebar conference is occurring.
		Besides, "Bob" decides that he is not interested in still
		receiving the conference audio in background (not even at a lower
		volume as "Alice" configured) and so modifies the sidebar in
		order to make that stream inactive for him.

        <t>
          Upon receipt of CCMP sidebarByValRequest message to
          "reserve" a new sidebar conference based upon the confObjID
          received in the request, the conferencing system uses the confObjID
          to clone a conference reservation for the sidebar.
          The sidebar reservation is NOT independent
          of the active conference (i.e., parent).
          The conferencing system
          also reserves or allocates a new confObjID to be used for any
          subsequent protocol requests from any of the members of the
          conference.
        </t>


        <t> The relationship information is provided in the sidebarByValResponse 
		    message, specifically in the "sidebar-parent" element. A dump of
		    the complete representation of the main/parent conference is
		    provided below as well to show how the cloning process for the creation
		    of the sidebar could take place.
      </t>

      <t>
        Upon receipt of the sidebarByValResponse 
        message to
        reserve the conference, "Alice" can now create an active conference
        using that reservation, or create additional reservations based upon
        the existing reservations. In this example, "Alice" wants only "Bob"
        to be involved in the sidebar, thus she manipulates the membership
        so that only the two of them appear in the "allowed-users-list" section.
        "Alice" also wants both audio and the video from the original conference
        to be available in the sidebar. For what concerns the media
        belonging to the sidebar itself, "Alice" wants the audio to be
        restricted to the participants in the sidebar (that is, her and "Bob").
        Additionally, "Alice" manipulates the media values to recieve
        the audio from the main conference at a reduced volume, so that
        the communication between her and "Bob" isn't affected. "Alice"
        sends a sidebarByValRequest message with an operation of "update" along
        with the sidebarByValInfo
        in the reservation, to create an active
        conference.
      </t>

      <t>
        Upon receipt of the sidebarByValRequest to update
        the reservation to create an active conference for the sidebar,
        as identified by the sidebar conference object ID, the conference server
        ensures that "Alice" has the appropriate authority based on the
        policies associated with that specific conference object to perform
        the operation. The conference server must also validate the
        updated information in the reservation, ensuring that a member like
        "Bob" is already a user of this conference server. Once the data for the
        confObjID is updated, the conference server sends a sidebarByValResponse to 
        "Alice".  
        Depending upon the policies, the initiator of the request (i.e.,
        "Alice") and the participants in the sidebar (i.e., "Bob") may be
        notified of his addition to the sidebar via the conference
        notification service.
      </t>
       
	  <t>
		    At this point, "Bob" sends a userRequest message to the conference server
        with an operation of "update" to
		    completely disable the background audio from the parent conference,
		    since it prevents him from understanding what "Alice" says in the
		    sidebar. 
	  </t>
    <t>
          Notice that "Bob's" request only changes the media perspective for
          "Bob". "Alice" keeps on receiving both the audio from "Bob" and
          the background from the parent conference. This request may be
          relayed by the conference server to the Media Server handling
          the mixing, if present. Upon completion of the change, the conference server
          sends a "userResponse" message to "Bob".  
          Depending upon the policies, the initiator of the request (i.e.,
          "Bob") and the participants in the sidebar (i.e., "Alice") may be
          notified of this change via the conference
          notification service.
     </t>
        
      </list>

		This is the representation of the conference the sidebar is going to
		be created in. As such, it will be used by the conferencing system
		in order to create the new conference object associated with the sidebar.
		In fact, the sidebar creation happens through a cloning of the parent conference.
		Once the sidebar is created, an "update" makes sure that the sidebar
		is customized as needed. The following protocol dump makes the process
		clearer.

    <!-- Internal sidebar -->

    <section anchor="sec:extSideb" title="External Sidebar">
      <t>
        <xref target="fig:extsidebar"></xref> provides an example of
		a different approach towards sidebar. In this scenario, one
        client, "Alice", is involved in an active conference with "Bob", "Carol",
        "David" and "Ethel". "Alice" gets an important text message via a
        whisper from "Bob" that a critical customer needs to talk to
        "Alice", "Bob" and "Ethel". "Alice" creates a sidebar to have a side
        discussion with the customer "Fred" including the participants in
        the current conference with the exception of "Carol" and "David",
        who remain in the active conference. The difference from the previous
		scenario is that "Fred" is not part of the parent conference: this means
		that different policies might be involved, considering that "Fred"
		may access information coming from the parent conference, in case the
		sidebar was configured accordingly. For this reason, in this scenario
		we assume that "Alice" disables all the media from the original (parent)
		conference within the sidebar. This means that, while in the previous
		example "Alice" and "Bob" still heard the audio from the main conference
		in background, this time no background is made available. "Alice" initiates the sidebar
        by sending a request to the conferencing system to create a
        conference reservation based upon the active conference object.
        "Alice", "Bob" and "Ethel" would remain on the roster of the main
        conference in a hold state. Whether or not the hold state of these
        participants is visible to other participants depends upon the
        individual and local policy.

      <t>
        Upon receipt of the "sidebarByRefRequest" message to
        create a new sidebar conference, based upon the active conference
        specified by "confObjID" in the request, the conferencing system uses the received
        active conference to clone a conference reservation for the sidebar.
        The sidebar reservation is NOT independent
        of the active conference (i.e., parent). The conferencing system
        as before reserves or allocates a conference ID (confObjID*) to be used for any
        subsequent protocol requests from any of the members of the
        conference. The conferencing system maintains the mapping between
        this conference ID and the conference object ID associated with the
        sidebar reservation through the conference instance. Just as before,
		this mapping is mantained in "sidebar-parent".
      </t>

      <t>
        Upon receipt of the "sidebarByRefResponse" message, which acknowledges the
		successful creation of the sidebar object, "Alice" decides that only "Bob"
        and "Ethel", along with the new participant "Fred" are to be involved in
        the sidebar. Thus she manipulates the membership accordingly. "Alice" also sets the
        media in the "conference-info" such that the participants in the sidebar don't receive any
        media from the main conference. All these settings are provided to the conferencing
		system by means of a new "sidebarByRefRequest" message, with an "update"
		operation.
      </t>

      <t>
        "Alice" sends the aforementioned "sidebarByRefRequest" to update the information in the reservation and to
        create an active conference.
        Upon receipt of the "sidebarByRefRequest" with an operation of "update",
        the conferencing system
        ensures that "Alice" has the appropriate authority based on the
        policies associated with that specific conference object to perform
        the operation. The conferencing system also validates the
        updated information in the reservation. Since "Fred" is a new user for this
        conferencing system, a conference user identifier is created for
        "Fred". Specifically, "Fred" is added to the conference by only providing
		his SIP URI. Based upon the addressing information provided for "Fred" by
        "Alice", the call signaling to add "Fred" to the conference may be
        instigated through the Focus (e.g. if "Fred" had a "dial-out" method set
		as the target for him) at the actual activation of the sidebar.
      </t>

      <t>
        The conference server sends a "sidebarByRefResponse" message and, depending upon the policies, 
        the initiator of the request (i.e.,
        "Alice") and the participants in the sidebar (i.e., "Bob" and
        "Ethel") may be notified of his addition to the sidebar via the
        conference notification service.

    <!-- External sidebar -->


    <!-- Sidebars -->

    <section title="Floor control using sidebars">
      <t>
        Floor control with sidebars can be used to realize conferencing
        scenario such as an analyst briefing. In this scenario, the conference
        call has a panel of speakers who are allowed to talk in the main
        conference. The other participants are the analysts, who are not
        allowed to speak unless they have the floor. To request access to the
        floor, they have to join a new sidebar with the moderator and ask
        their question. The moderator can also whisper to each analyst what
        their status/position in the floor control queue, similar to the
        example in <xref target="fig:whisper"></xref>.  It should be noted that other
        mechanisms which don't make use of sidebars could be used for floor control
        such as those detailed in BFCP.
      </t>

      <t>
        <xref target="fig:flrctl"></xref> provides an example of the
        configuration involved for this type of conference. As in the previous
        sidebar examples, there is the main conference along with a sidebar.
        "Alice" and "Bob" are the main participants in the conference, with
        "A1", "A2" and "A3" representing the analysts. The sidebar remains
        active throughout the conference, with the moderator, "Carol", serving
        as the chair. As discussed previously, the sidebar conference is NOT
        independent of the active conference (i.e., parent). The analysts are
        provided the conference object ID associated with the active sidebar
        when they join the main conference. The conferencing system also
        allocates a conference ID to be used for any subsequent manipulations
        of the sidebar conference. The conferencing system maintains the
        mapping between this conference ID and the conference object ID
        associated with the active sidebar conference through the conference
        instance. The analysts are permanently muted while in the main
        conference. The analysts are moved to the sidebar when they wish to
        speak. Only one analyst is given the floor at a given time. All
        participants in the main conference receive audio from the sidebar
        conference, as well as audio provided by the panelists in the main
        conference.

        Upon receipt of the request, the

    <section title="Whispering or Private Messages">
      <t>
        The case of private messages can be handled as a sidebar with just
        two participants, similarly to the example in section <xref
        target="sec:intsideb"></xref>. Unlike the previous example, anyway, rather than using audio within the
        sidebar, "Alice" could just add an additional text based media stream to
        the sidebar in order to convey her whisper. From the protocol point of view, with reference to the
        messages described in <xref target="fig-internal-sidebar-msg"></xref>, only
        the third CCMP message (a sidebarByValRequest/update) changes, as depicted
        in <xref target="fig-private-messages-msg"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The other context, referred to as whisper, in this
        document refers to situations involving one time media targetted to
        specific user(s). An example of a whisper would be an announcement
        injected only to the conference chair or to a new participant joining
        a conference. Please notice that such an announcement would not be
        conveyed by means of CCMP, while rather by means of a notification
        protocol related to it, e.g. a SIP event package, XMPP, or even a
        multimedia announcement. CCMP would only be involved with respect
        to the creation of an ad-hoc sidebar, as it will be clearer in the
        following lines.
      </t>

      <t>
        <xref target="fig:whisper"></xref> provides an example of one user
        "Alice" who's chairing a fixed length conference with "Bob" and
        "Carol". The configuration is such that only the chair is providing a
        warning when there is only 10 minutes left in the conference. At that
        time, "Alice" is moved into a sidebar created by the conferencing
        system and only "Alice" receives the announcement.

        When the conferencing system determines that there is only 10
        minutes left in the conference which "Alice" is chairing, the conferencing system directly
        creates an active sidebar conference, based on the active conference
        associated with "Alice". This sidebar
        conference is NOT independent of the active conference (i.e., parent).
        The conferencing system also allocates a conference ID to be used for
        any subsequent manipulations of the sidebar conference.
      </t>

      <t>
        Immediately upon creation of the active sidebar conference, the
        announcement media is provided to "Alice". Depending upon the
        policies, Alice may be notified of her addition to the sidebar via the
        conference notification service. "Alice" continues to receive the
        media from the main conference.
      </t>

      <t>
        Upon completion of the announcement, "Alice" is removed from the
        siebar and the sidebar conference is deleted.

        "Alice" is notified of her removal from the sidebar via

        An example of observing and coaching is shown in figure <xref

        involved in a conference with customer "Carol". Since "Bob" is a new
        agent and "Alice" sees that he has been on the call with "Carol" for
        longer than normal, she decides to observe the call and coach "Bob" as

        Upon receipt of the sidbarByRefRequest/create from
        "Alice" to "create" a new sidebar conference from the confObjID
        received in the request, the conferencing system uses the
        received active conference to clone a conference reservation for the
        sidebar. The conferencing system also allocates a
        conference ID to be used for any subsequent protocol requests from any
        of the members of the conference. The conferencing system maintains
        the mapping between this conference ID and the confObjID
        associated with the sidebar reservation through the conference
        instance.  The conference server sends a sidebarByRefResponse message with the
        new confObjID and relevant confInfo. 
      </t>

        <t>
          Upon receipt of the confResponse message,
          "Alice" manipulates the data received in the confInfo in the response.
          "Alice" wants only "Bob" to be involved
          in the sidebar, thus she updates the "allowed-users-list" to include
          only "Bob". "Alice" also
          wants the audio to be received by herself and "Bob" from the original
          conference, but wants any outgoing audio from herself to be restricted
          to the participants in the sidebar, whereas "Bob's" outgoing audio
          should go to the main conference, so that both "Alice" and the
          customer "Carol" hear the same audio from "Bob".
        "Alice" sends a
        sidebarByRefRequest message with an "update" operation including the updated conference
        information.
      </t>

        <t>
          Upon receipt of the sidbarByRefRequest message with an "update" operation,
          the conferencing system
          ensures that "Alice" has the appropriate authority based on the
          policies associated with that specific conference object to perform
          the operation.
        </t>


        <t>
        After validating the data, the conference server sends a sidebarByRefResponse message.  
        Based upon the addressing information provided for
        "Bob" by "Alice", the call signaling to add "Bob" to the sidebar with
        the appropriate media characteristics is instigated through the
        Focus.
        "Bob" is notified of his addition to the sidebar via the conference
        notification service, thus he is aware that "Alice" the supervisor is
        available for coaching him through this call.

      The following scenarios detail the basic operations associated with removing participants from conferences
      and entirely deleting conferences.  The examples assume that a conference has already been
      correctly established, with media, if applicable, per one of the examples in
      <xref target="sec-create"/>.
    </t>

    <section title="Removing a Party" anchor="sec-removeparty">

      <t>
        <xref target="fig:remove"></xref> provides an example of one client
        "Alice" removing another participant "Bob" from a conference. This example
        assumes an established conference with "Alice", "Bob", "Claire" and "Duck". 
        In this example, "Alice" wants to
        remove "Bob" from the conference so that the group can continue in the same conference without
        "Bob"'s participation.

          "Alice" sends a userRequest message, with a "delete" operation.
          The conference server ensures that "Alice" has
          the appropriate authority based on the policies associated with that

            Based upon the addressing and media
            information in the conference object for "Bob" in the "user" element, the conference
            instigates the process
            to remove "Bob" (e.g., the call signaling to remove
            "Bob" from the conference is instigated through the Focus).
            The conference server updates the data in the conference object,
            thus removing "Bob" from the "users" list. 
            After updating the data, the conference server sends a userResponse message 
            to "Alice".  Depending upon the policies, other participants (e.g. "Claire") may
            be notified of the removal of "Bob" from the conference via the
            Conference Notification Service.

  <section title="Additional Conference Scenarios and Examples" anchor="sec-examples2">
    <t>
      The following are additional scenarios making use of the XCON framework and
      associated protocols.  In some cases, these examples make use of some of the building
      block scenarios detailed in the previous example sections, in which case the appropriate
      scenario is referenced rather than duplicating details.  In addition, in cases where the scenarios
      make use of other protocols, as in the previous section, the appropriate reference in the form of a title
      to the specific flow in the appropriate protocol document is included.
    </t>

    <section title="Chat" anchor="sec-chat">
      <t>
        The chat functionality described in this section of the document 
        allows clients that use the XCON framework and protocols
        for other media types (e.g. voice/video) to utilize the same conference
        control mechanisms and conferencing system to establish, update and
        delete a conference instance associated with an Instant Messaging (IM) 
        chat session,
        independent of the IM chat protocol.  In some cases(e.g., Message Session
        Relay Protocol (MSRP) chat),
        this would provide additional capabilities, such as sidebars.
        This approach also allows the
        conferencing system to provide a natural interworking point for various
        IM protocols, the details of the interworking are outside the scope of
        this document.
      </t>

      <t>
        An IM client wishing to join a conference uses standardized
        centralized conferencing mechanisms for creating and joining a
        conference, as identified in the previous sections. 
        The request to send an IM to an IM media session is specific to the
        IM protocol (e.g., MSRP SEND), just as there is specific media control
        messaging for other types of sessions. An IM client connecting to
        a conferencing system has a 1:1 relationship with the IM media signaling
        entity in the conferencing system.   This relationship is referred to as an 
        IM session.  Further details of the correlation of the IM session identifiers
        with the XCON session identifiers is provided in <xref target="I-D.boulton-xcon-session-chat"/>.
        The IM media signaling entity is responsible for distribution of all 
        the messages to the other participants.
      </t>

      <t>
        As with the other example conferences created, each IM session is logically
        associated with a
        specific conference.
        The conference itself has a specific identifier in the
        form of the XCON-URI, which is passed in the "confObjID" element in the
        CCMP messages.
        This provides the relevant
        association between IM session and a centralized conference.
      </t>

      <t>
        An IM client wishing to delete a chat room uses standardized
        mechanisms for deleting a conference instance, such as those detailed in
        <xref target="sec-deleteConf"></xref>.

        This section provides details of the realization of the Multi-party
        IM (chat) within the context of the centralized conferencing framework.
        A brief discussion and diagrams are provided for creating, joining, and
        deleting a chat based conference. The discovery of chat rooms available
        on a specific conferencing system is inherent in the blueprint
        capability provided by the conferencing system. The objective of this
        section is to further illustrate the model, mechanisms and protocols
        presented in the previous sections and also serves to validate that the
        model, mechanisms and protocols are sufficient to support IM chat.
      </t>

      <t>
        It should be noted that not all entities impacted by the
        request are shown in the diagram (e.g., Focus), but rather the emphasis
        is on the new entities introduced by this centralized conferencing
        framework. 
      </t>

      <section anchor="sec:create" title="Creating a Chat Room">
        <t>
          There are different ways to create a conference. A participant can
          create a conference using call signaling means only, such as SIP, as
          detailed in <xref target="RFC4579"></xref>. For a conferencing client
          to have more flexibility in defining the charaterisitics and
          capabilities of a chat based conference, a conferencing client would
          implement a conference control protocol client. By using a conference
          control protocol, the client can determine the capabilities of a
          conferencing system and its various resources.
        </t>

        <t>
          <xref target="fig:create"></xref> provides an example of one client
          "Alice" determining the conference blueprints available to support
          various types of chat rooms for a particular conferencing system and
          creating a chat based conference using the desired blueprint.

        <t>
          Upon receipt of the Conference Control Protocol request for
          blueprints associated with chat rooms, the conferencing system would
          first authenticate "Alice" (and allocate a conference user identifier,
          if necessary) and then ensure that "Alice" has the appropriate
          authority based on system policies to receive any chat room based
          blueprints supported by that system. Any blueprints that "Alice" is
          authorized to use are returned in a response, along with the
          conference user ID.
        </t>

        <t>
          Upon receipt of the Conference Control Protocol response containing
          the blueprints, "Alice" determines which blueprint to use for the
          conference to be created. "Alice" creates a conference object based on
          the blueprint (i.e., clones) and modifies applicable fields, such as
          membership list, topic details, and start time. "Alice" then sends a
          request to the conferencing system to create a conference reservation
          based upon the updated blueprint.
        </t>

        <t>
          Upon receipt of the Conference Control Protocol request to "create"
          a conference based upon the blueprint in the request, the conferencing
          system ensures that the blueprint received is a valid blueprint (i.e.
          the values of the various field are within range). The conferencing
          system determines the appropriate read/write access of any users to be
          added to a conference based on this blueprint (using membership,
          roles, etc.). The conferencing system uses the received blueprint to
          clone a conference reservation. The conferencing system also reserves
          or allocates a conference ID to be used for any subsequent protocol
          requests from any of the members of the conference. The conferencing
          system maintains the mapping between this conference ID and the
          conference object ID associated with the reservation through the
          conference instance.
        </t>

        <t>
          Upon receipt of the conference control protocol response to reserve
          the conference, "Alice" now creates an active chat room using that
          reservation. "Alice" provides the conference information, including
          the necessary conference ID, to desired participants to allow them to
          join the chat room. "Alice" may also add other users to the chat room.
          When the first participant, including "Alice", requests to be added to
          the conference, an active conference and focus are created. The focus
          is associated with the conference ID received in the request.

          A participant can join and leave the conference using call
          signaling means only, such as SIP. However, in order to perform richer
          conference control a user client can implement a conference control
          protocol client. By using a conference control protocol, the client
          can affect its own state and the state of other participants,
          depending upon policies, which may indirectly affect the state of any
          of the conference participants.

        <t>
          In the example in section <xref target="sec:create"></xref>,
          "Alice" has reserved a chat room . "Alice" has also already joined the

          additional participants to the chat room or provide the conference
          information, including the necessary conference ID, to desired
          participants and allow them to request to join themselves. Any
          participants that have the authority to manipulate the conference

          Upon receipt of the Conference Control Protocol request to "add" a

          conference object ID, the conferencing system must determine whether
          "Bob" is already a user of this conferencing system or whether he is a
          new user. If "Bob" is a new user for this conferencing system, a
          Conference User Identifier is created for Bob. The conferencing system
          must also ensure that "Bob" has the appropriate authority based on the

          described in the Sidebar section and related subsections within the
          Conferencing Scenarios Realization section of the centralized
          conferencing framework document <xref
        target="RFC5239"></xref>. The creation, manipulation
          and deletion of sidebars for chat rooms follows the same
          principles.
        </t>

        <t>
          A conference object representing a sidebar is created by cloning
          the parent associated with the existing conference and updating any
          information specific to the sidebar. A sidebar conference object is
          implicitly linked to the parent conference object (i.e. it is not an
          independent object) and is associated with the parent conference
          object identifier. A conferencing system manages and enforces the
          parent and appropriate localized restrictions on the sidebar
          conference object (e.g., no members from outside the parent conference
          instance can join, sidebar conference can not exist if parent
          conference is terminated, etc.).
        </t>

        <t>
          <xref target="fig:sidebar-chat"></xref> provides an example of one
          client "Alice" involved in active chat room with "Bob" and "Carol".
          "Alice" wants to create a sidebar to have a side discussion with "Bob"
          while still receiving the session based messaging associated with the
          main chat room. Whether the text is interleaved with the main chat or
          whether a separate window is created for the sidebar is implementation
          specific. "Alice" initiates the sidebar by sending a request to the
          conferencing system to create a conference chat reservation based upon
          the active chat conference object. "Alice" and "Bob" would remain on
          the roster of the main conference, such that other participants could
          be aware of their participation in the main conference, while the text
          sidebar conference is occurring.

        </t>

        <t>
          Upon receipt of the Conference Control Protocol request to
          "reserve" a new sidebar chat conference, based upon the active chat
          conference received in the request, the conferencing system uses the
          received active chat conference to clone a conference chat reservation
          for the sidebar. As discussed previously, the sidebar reservation is
          NOT independent of the active conference (i.e., parent). The
          conferencing system also reserves or allocates a conference ID to be
          used for any subsequent protocol requests from any of the members of
          the conference. The conferencing system maintains the mapping between
          this conference ID and the conference object ID associated with the
          sidebar reservation through the conference instance.
        </t>

        <t>
          Upon receipt of the conference control protocol response to reserve
          the conference, "Alice" can now create an active chat conference using
          that reservation or create additional reservations based upon the
          existing reservations. In this example, "Alice" wants only "Bob" to be
          involved in the sidebar, thus she manipulates the membership. "Alice"
          also only wants the text from the original conference, but wants the
          text within the sidebar to be restricted to the participants in the
          sidebar. "Alice" sends a conference control protocol request to update
          the information in the reservation and to create an active
          conference.
        </t>

        <t>
          Upon receipt of the conference control protocol request to update
          the reservation and to create an active chat conference for the
          sidebar, as identified by the conference object ID, the conferencing
          system ensures that "Alice" has the appropriate authority based on the
          policies associated with that specific conference object to perform
          the operation. The conferencing system must also validate the updated
          information in the reservation, ensuring that a member like "Bob" is
          already a user of this conferencing system.
        </t>

        <t>
          Depending upon the policies, the initiator of the request (i.e.,
          "Alice") and the participants in the sidebar (i.e., "Bob") may be
          notified of his addition to the sidebar via the conference
          notification service.

      <!-- Sidebar -->

      <section anchor="sec:TextPrivate" title="Private Message">
        <t>
          The case of private messages can be handled as a sidebar with just
          two participants, identical to the example in section <xref
        target="sec:TextSidebar"></xref>. The other context, referred to as
          whisper, in this document refers to situations involving one time
          media targetted to specific user(s). An example of a whisper would be
          a text message injected only to the conference chair or to a new
          participant joining a conference.
        </t>

        <t>
          <xref target="fig:chat-whisper"></xref> provides an example of one user
          "Alice" who's chairing a fixed length conference with "Bob" and
          "Carol". The configuration is such that only the chair is providing a
          warning when there is only 10 minutes left in the conference. At that
          time, "Alice" is moved into a sidebar created by the conferencing
          system and only "Alice" receives that text message announcing the 10
          minute warning.
        </t>

        <t>

            </artwork>
          </figure>
        </t>

        <t>
          When the conferencing system determines that there is only 10
          minutes left in the conference which "Alice" is chairing, rather than
          creating a reservation as was done for the sidebar in <xref
        target="sec:TextSidebar"></xref>, the conferencing system directly
          creates an active chat sidebar conference, based on the active chat
          conference associated with "Alice". As discussed previously, the
          sidebar conference is NOT independent of the active conference (i.e.,
          parent). The conferencing system also allocates a conference ID to be
          used for any subsequent manipulations of the sidebar chat conference.
          The conferencing system maintains the mapping between this conference
          ID and the conference object ID associated with the active sidebar
          conference through the conference instance.
        </t>

        <t>
          Immediately upon creation of the active chat sidebar conference,
          the text announcement is provided to "Alice". Depending upon the
          policies, Alice may be notified of her addition to the sidebar via the
          conference notification service. "Alice" continues to receive the text
          messages from the main conference.
        </t>

        <t>
          Upon delivery of the text announcement, "Alice" is removed from the
          sidebar and the sidebar conference is deleted. Depending upon the
          policies, "Alice" may be notified of her removal from the sidebar via
          the conference notification service.

		</t>
		<t>
			<list style="symbols">
				<t>updated the call flows in order to take into account the new versioning
				mechanism of the CCMP;</t>
				<vspace blankLines='1'/>
				<t>clarified, per agreement in Stockholm, that cloning from a blueprint does not
				need a cloning-parent to be made available in the response;</t>
				<vspace blankLines='1'/>
				<t>clarified that BFCP and CCMP-based media control are neither in conflict nor
				one the wrapper of the other; they act at different levels, and when both are involved,
				it is required that both grant a resource before it can be used by an interested participant;</t>
				<vspace blankLines='1'/>
				<t>changed all the domains involved in the flows to make them compliant
				with <xref target="RFC2606"/>;</t>
				<vspace blankLines='1'/>
				<t>clarified that a successful creation of a new conference object may or may not
				contain the whole confInfo object in the response; in case it doesn't, a retrieve
				of the updated object can be achieved by issuing a confRequest/retrieve;</t>
				<vspace blankLines='1'/>
				<t>clarified that the scenario in <xref target="sec-anncrec"/> only involves CCMP in adding the
				user to a conference; this includes requiring the use of a password only in adding the user
				to the conference object; the actual request for PIN/Password when joining thw conference is
				handled by means of out-of-band mechanisms
				(in this case at the media level, with the help of the MEDIACTRL framework);</t>
				<vspace blankLines='1'/>
				<t>added and corrected Sidebars-related scenarios;</t>
				<vspace blankLines='1'/>
				<t>added flows for some previously missing scenarios: Private Message/Whisper, Coaching Scenario, Removing a Party, Deleting a Conference;</t>
