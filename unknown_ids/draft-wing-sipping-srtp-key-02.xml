    <abstract>
      <t>Many Secure RTP (SRTP) key exchange mechanisms do not disclose the
      SRTP session keys to intermediate SIP proxies. However, these key
      exchange mechanisms cannot be used in environments where transcoding,
      monitoring, or call recording are needed. This document specifies a
      secure mechanism for a cooperating endpoint to disclose its SRTP master
      keys to an authorized party.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document addresses 2 difficulties with End-to-end encryption of
      RTP (<xref target="RFC3711">SRTP</xref>): transcoding and media
      recording. When peering with other networks, different codecs are
      sometimes necessary (transcoding a surround-sound codec for transmission
      over a highly-compressed bandwidth-constrained network, for example). In
      some environments (e.g., stock brokerages and banks) regulations and
      business needs require recording calls with coworkers or with customers.
      In many environments, quality problems such as echo can only be
      diagnosed by listening to the call (analyzing SRTP headers is not
      sufficient).</t>

      <t>With an RTP stream, transcoding is accomplished by modifying SDP to
      offer a different codec through a transcoding device <xref
      target="RFC4117"></xref>, and call recording or monitoring can be
      accomplished with an Ethernet sniffer listening for SIP and its
      associated RTP, with a media relay, or with a Session Border Controller.
      However, when media is encrypted end-to-end <xref
      target="I-D.wing-rtpsec-keying-eval"></xref>, these existing techniques
      fail because they are unable to decrypt the media packets.</t>

      <t>When a media session is encrypted with SRTP, there are three
      techniques to decrypt the media for monitoring or call recording:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>the endpoint establishes a separate media stream to the recording
          device, with a separate SRTP key, and sends the (mixed) media to the
          recording device. This techniques is often referenced as active
          recording here. The disadvantages of this technique include doubling
          bandwidth requirements in the network and additionally the
          processing power on the client side, Moreover, the loss of media
          recording facility doesn't cause loss of call (as is required in
          some environments). A significant advantage of this technique,
          however, is that it's secure: a malicious media recording device
          cannot inject media to the connected party on behalf of the
          endpoint. Depending on the application requirements it may be
          necessary to establish a reliable connection to the recording device
          to cope with possible packet loss on the unreliable link, typically
          used for media transport.</t>

          <t>the endpoint relays media through a device which forks a separate
          media stream to the recording device. This technique is often
          employed by Session Border Controllers, and could also be employed
          by TURN servers.</t>

          <t>Network monitoring devices are used to listen to the SRTP traffic
          and correlate SRTP with SIP (with cooperation of call signaling
          devices, if the call signaling is encrypted).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document describes cases (2) and (3) where a cooperating
      endpoint publishes its SRTP master keys to an authorized party using the
      <xref target="RFC3903">SIP Event State Publication Extension</xref>. The
      mechanism can be described as passive recording, as the client is not
      directly involved into the media recording. It merely provides the key
      information to a recording device. The mechanism described in this paper
      allows secure disclosure of SRTP session keys to authorized parties so
      that an endpoints media stream can be transcoded or decrypted, as needed
      by that environment. Technique (1) stated above is not considered
      further in this document, as it does not require the disclosure of the
      key used for the communication between the two endpoints.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The following terminology is taken directly from <xref
      target="RFC3903">SIP Event State Publication Extension</xref>:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Event Publication Agent (EPA):">The User Agent Client
          (UAC) that issues PUBLISH requests to publish event state.</t>

          <t hangText="Event State Compositor (ESC):">The User Agent Server
          (UAS) that processes PUBLISH requests, and is responsible for
          compositing event state into a complete, composite event state of a
          resource.</t>

          <t hangText="Publication:">The act of an EPA sending a PUBLISH
          request to an ESC to publish event state.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Operation">
      <t>For transcoding, RTP packets must be sent from and received by a
      device which performs the transcoding. When the media is encrypted, this
      device must be capable of decrypting the media, performing the
      transcoding function, and re-encrypting the media.</t>

      <t><list>
          <t>ISSUE-1: should we consider providing some or all of the SIP
          headers, as well? Some recording functions will need to know the
          identity of the remote party. This information could be gleaned from
          the SIP proxies, though, and starts to fall outside the intended
          scope of this document.</t>

          <t>ISSUE-2: The authors have been considering use of <xref
          target="RFC3830">MIKEY</xref>, but MIKEY may not be used off the
          shelf. Certain changes to the state machine may have to be made
          (RFC3830 describes the TGK transport rather than SRTP master key
          transport).</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="Learning Name and Certificate of ESC">
        <t>The endpoint will be configured with the AOR of its ESC (e.g.,
        "transcoder@example.com"). If S/MIME is used to send the SRTP master
        key to the ESC, the endpoint is additionally configured with the
        certificate of its ESC.</t>

        <t>The name and public key of the ESC is configured into the
        endpoint.It is vital that the public key of the ESC is not changed by
        an unauthorized user. Changes to change that public key will cause
        SRTP key disclosure to be encrypted with that key. It is RECOMMENDED
        that endpoints restrict changing the public key of the disclosure
        device using protections similar to changes to the endpoint's SIP
        username and SIP password.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Authorization of ESC">
        <t>Depending on the application, authorization of the key disclosure
        and distribution to the ESC may be necessary besides the pure
        transport security of the key distribution itself. This may be the
        case when the config framework <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework"></xref> is not applied and
        thus the information about the ESC is not known to the client.</t>

        <t>This can be done by providing a SAML extension, according to <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-sip-saml"></xref> in the header of the SUBSCRIBE
        message. The SAML assertion shall at least contain the information
        about the ESC, call related information to associate the call with the
        assertion (editors note: we may also define wildcards here to allow
        for recordings of all phone calls for a day, independent of the call)
        and a reference to the certificate for the ESC. The latter information
        is needed to transport the SRTP Session Key to the ESC in a protected
        manner, as described in the section below.</t>

        <t>The signature of the SAML assertion should be produced using the
        private key of the domain certificate. This certificate MUST have a
        SubjAltName which matches the domain of user agent's SIP proxy (that
        is, if the SIP proxy is sip.example.com, the SubjAltName of the domain
        certificate signing this SAML assertion MUST also be example.com).
        Here, the main focus is placed on communication of clients with the
        ESC, which belongs to the client's home domain.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sending SRTP Session Keys to ESC">
        <t>SDP is used to describe the media session to the ESC. However, the
        existing <xref target="RFC4568">Security Descriptions</xref> only
        describes the master key and parameters of the SRTP packets being sent
        -- it does not describe the master key (and parameters) of the SRTP
        being received, or the SSRC being transmitted. For transcoding and
        media recording, both the sending key and receiving key are needed and
        in some cases the SSRC is needed.</t>

        <t>Thus, we hereby extend the existing crypto attribute to indicate
        the SSRC. We also create a new SDP attribute, "rcrypto", which is
        identical to the existing "crypto" attribute, except that it describes
        the receiving keys and their SSRCs. For example:</t>

        </figure>

        <t>The full SDP, including the keying information, is then sent to the
        ESC. The keying information MUST be encrypted and integrity protected.
        Existing mechanisms such as <xref target="RFC3261">S/MIME</xref> and
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-sips">SIPS</xref> or SIP over TLS (on all
        hops per administrative means) MAY be used to achieve this goal, or
        other mechanisms may be defined.</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="[[">ISSUE-3: if a endpoint is receiving multiple
            incoming streams from multiple endpoints, it will have negotiated
            different keys with each of them, and all of that traffic is
            coming to the same transport address on the endpoint. Thus, we
            need a way to describe the different keys we're using to/from
            different transport addresses. One solution is to indicate the
            remote transport address. Indicating the remote SSRC is
            insufficient for this task, as several SRTP keying mechanisms do
            not include SSRC in their signaling (DTLS-SRTP, ZRTP, Security
            Descriptions). <vspace blankLines="1" />For example, if there were

            outside the scope of this document, but an example can be found in

            SUBSCRIBE message, send from the ESC to the client. The assertion
            needs to provide at least the call relation, or a time intervall

      <section title="Incorrect ESC">
        <t>Insertion of the incorrect public key of the SRTP ESC will result
        in disclosure of the SRTP session key to an unauthorized party. Thus,
        the UA's configuration MUST be protected to prevent such
        misconfiguration. To avoid changes to the configuration in the end
        device, the configuration access MUST be suitably protected.</t>

      <section anchor="disclosing_srtp_session_key"
               title="Risks of Sharing SRTP Session Key">
        <t>A party authorized to obtain the SRTP session key can listen to the
        media stream and could inject data into the media stream as if it were
        either party. The alternatives are worse: disclose the device's
        private key to the transcoder or media recording device, or abandon
        using secure SRTP key exchange in environments that require media
        transcoding or media recording. As we wish to promote the use of
        secure SRTP key exchange mechanisms, disclosure of the SRTP session
        key appears the least of these evils.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Disclosure Flag">
        <t>Secure SRTP key exchange techniques which implement this
        specification SHOULD provide a "disclosure flag", similar to that
        first proposed in Appendix B of <xref
        target="I-D.zimmermann-avt-zrtp"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Integrity and encryption of keying information">
        <t>The mechanism describe in this specification relies on protecting
        and encrypting the keying infomation. There are well known mechanism
        to achieve that goal.</t>

        <t>Using SIPS to convey the SRTP key exposes the SRTP master key to
        all SIP proxies between the Event Publication Agent (ESC, the SIP User
        Agent) and the Event State Compositor (ESC). S/MIME allows disclosing
        the SRTP master key to only the ESC.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>New SSRC extension of the "crypto" attribute, and the new "rcrypto"
      attribute will be registered here.</t>

        relies on the SIP network providing TLS encryption of the SRTP master
        keys to the ESC.</preamble>
