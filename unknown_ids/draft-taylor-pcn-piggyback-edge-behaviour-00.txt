   describes a behaviour for PCN egress nodes known as the
   "piggybacking" edge behaviour, because it "piggybacks" PCN
   information in resource signalling messages.  This version of the
   memo describes two alternatives, where piggybacking is derived from
   the CL edge behaviour and where it is derived from the SM edge
   behaviour.  The SM and CL edge behaviours are specified in companion
   documents.

Internet-Draft         Piggybacking Edge Behaviour          October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The main objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to support
   the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv
   domain, in a simple, scalable, and robust fashion.  Two mechanisms
   are used: admission control and flow termination.  Admission control
   is used to decide whether to admit or block a new flow request, while
   flow termination is used in abnormal circumstances to decide whether
   to terminate some of the existing flows.  To support these two
   features the overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered on every link in
   the domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain
   configured rates are exceeded.  These configured rates are below the
   rate of the link thus providing notification to boundary nodes about
   overloads before any congestion occurs (hence "pre-congestion"
   notification).  The level of marking allows boundary nodes to make
   decisions about whether to admit or terminate.  For more details see
   [RFC5559].

   The CL and SM edge node behaviours, described in
   [I-D.CL-edge-behaviour] and [I-D.SM-edge-behaviour], specify
   assumptions on the marking behaviour within the PCN domain, the
   measurements to be taken at ingress and egress nodes respectively,
   and the processing of those measurements to allow the making of flow
   admisssion and flow termination decisions.  In both edge behaviours,
   the decision point for individual flows is either the ingress node or
   a centralized policy server.  This document specifies an edge
   behaviour where the admission decision for individual flows is taken
   at the egress node.  This is accomplished by using resource
   signalling (e.g., RSVP) to carry the per-flow decision back to the
   ingress node for enforcement.  Flow termination requires input from
   both the ingress node and egress node, hence the resource signalling
   is also used to carry part of the necessary information from the
   egress node to the ingress node.  This usage of resource signalling
   for the additional purpose of carrying PCN measurement data is the
   reason for calling this the "piggybacking" edge behaviour.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Measurement Behaviour

   The ingress and egress nodes to a PCN domain have particular roles to
   play in supporting the PCN mechanisms.  These are described in
   general terms in [RFC5559].  This edge behaviour specification

Internet-Draft         Piggybacking Edge Behaviour          October 2009


   assumes that both ingress and egress nodes meter PCN traffic
   continuously.  Based on this metering, the ingress node periodically
   calculates and records the rate of PCN traffic it admits to each
   ingress-egress aggregate, in octets per second.  Similarly, the
   egress node periodically calculates and records the rate of PCN
   traffic it receives from each ingress-egress aggregate, in octets per
   second.  In both of the scenarios considered below, it records the
   rate of traffic received in PCN-unmarked packets and in PCN-excess-
   marked packets.  In the CL-like behaviour scenario, it also records
   the rate of traffic received in PCN-threshold-marked packets.


3.  Assumed Domain Behaviour

   The key assumption made in the piggybacking edge behaviour is that
   resource availabilty for flow admission is determined through the use
   of resource signalling (e.g., RSVP) to reserve resources along the
   flow path.  It is assumed that for flows within a given ingress-
   egress aggregate, all such signalling passes through the ingress and
   egress nodes defining the aggregate, in both directions.

   Beyond this, this specification considers two alternative scenarios.
   In the CL-like scenario, three-state PCN marking is used, so that
   packets arriving at the egress node may be PCN-unmarked, PCN-
   threshold-marked, or PCN-excess-marked.  Marking behaviour is as
   specified in [I-D.CL-edge-behaviour].  In the SM-like scenario, two-
   state PCN marking is used, so that packets arriving at the egress
   node may be PCN-unmarked or PCN-excess-marked only.  Marking
   behaviour is as specified in [I-D.CL-edge-behaviour].


4.  Egress Node Behaviour

   As each new set of measurements becomes available, the egress node
   calculates the ratio of PCN-unmarked octets to total PCN traffic
   received subtracts this ratio from 1, and updates an exponentially-
   smoothed average of the result.  That is:

      New ratio = 1 - (Unmarked traffic rate / Total traffic rate)

      New smoothed average = w * new ratio + (1-w) * old smoothed
      average

   where w is a suitable smoothing weight.  See simulation results
   documented in TBD for reasonable values of w.

   The egress node compares the new smoothed average to a pre-configured
   threshold to determine its current admission state.  If the smoothed

   average exceeds the threshold, the egress node enters "block" state
   until the next set of measurements becomes available.  If the
   smoothed average does not exceed the configured threshold, the egress
   node is in "admit" state until the next set of measurements becomes
   available.

   Each time the egress node processes a resource signalling message
   where the egress node will propagate the message toward the ingress
   node, the egress node consults its current admission state.  If the
   admission state is "admit", the egress node propagates the resource
   signalling without any further action beyond that required by the
   signalling system itself.  If the admission state is "block", the
   egress node adds an indication in the message it propagates that
   resources are unavailable for the flow being signalled.  It also adds
   two numbers to the message: the latest measured rate of total PCN
   traffic received, and the rate of PCN-excess-marked traffic received,
   both in octets per second.


5.  Ingress Node Behaviour

   Ingress node behaviour with respect to admission is the same for both
   the CL-like and the SM-like scenario.  The ingress node admits the
   new flow if the returning resource signalling message indicates
   resources available, and blocks it if the returning resource
   signalling message indicates that insufficient resources are
   unavailable.

   Behaviour with respect to flow termination differs slightly between
   the two scenarios.  Flow termination is considered in either case
   only if the received resource signalling message indicates not only
   that insufficient resources are available to admit the flow, but also
   reports a non-zero level of excess-marked traffic.  If these
   conditions are satisfied:

   o  in the CL-like scenario, the ingress node computes an estimate of
      the edge-to-edge supportable rate of PCN traffic equal to the
      difference between the total traffic rate reported in the resource
      signalling message and the PCN-excess-marked traffic rate.

   o  in the SM-like scenario the ingress node calculates the difference
      between the total traffic rate reported in the resource signalling
      message and the PCN-excess-marked traffic rate, but then computes
      an estimate of the edge-to-edge supportable rate of PCN traffic
      equal to this difference multiplied by a pre-configured factor U,
      which is the same for all ingress-egress aggregates.

   The ingress node terminates flows amounting to a total traffic rate

   equal to the difference between the most-recently measured rate of
   admitted PCN traffic at the ingress node and the estimate of the
   edge-to-edge supportable rate calculated as just described.  In the
   CL-like case, termination is always required if the preconditions for
   this calculation have been met.  In the SM-like case, termination may
   not be required.
