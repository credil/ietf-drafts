   recent documents have proposed ways to modify GMPLS signaling 
   protocols to support these new OTN features.  

   It is important that a single solution is developed for use in GMPLS 
   signaling and routing protocols. This solution must support ODUk 
   multiplexing capabilities, address all of the new features, be 
   acceptable to all equipment vendors, and be extensible considering 
   continued OTN evolution.  

   This document describes the extensions to the Generalized Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling to control the evolving 
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN) addressing ODUk multiplexing and new 
   features including ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex.

1. Introduction 

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] extends 
   MPLS to include Layer-2 Switching (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex 
   (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, and ODU), Wavelength (OCh, Lambdas) Switching, 
   and Spatial Switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port 
   or fiber). [RFC3471] presents a functional description of the 
   extensions to Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) signaling 
   required to support Generalized MPLS.  RSVP-TE-specific formats and 
   mechanisms and technology specific details are defined in [RFC3473]. 

   With the evolution and deployment of G.709 technology, it is 
   necessary that appropriate enhanced control technology support be 
   provided for G.709. [RFC4328] describes the control technology 
   details that are specific to foundation G.709 Optical Transport 
   Networks (OTN), as specified in the ITU-T Recommendation G.709[G709-
   V1], for ODUk deployments without multiplexing. 

   In addition to increasing need to support ODUk multiplexing, the 
   evolution of OTN has introduced additional containers and new 
   flexibility. For example, ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 containers and ODUflex 
   are developed in [G709-V3]. 

   In addition, the following issues require consideration: 

      -  Support for hitless adjustment of ODUflex, which is to be 
         specified in ITU-T G.hao. 

      -  Support for Tributary Port Number. The Tributary Port Number 
         has to be negotiated on each link for flexible assignment of 
         tributary ports to tributary slots in case of LO-ODU over HO-
         ODU (e.g., ODU2 into ODU3).  

   Therefore, it is clear that [RFC4328] has to be updated or superceded 
   in order to support ODUk multiplexing, as well as other ODU 
   enhancements introduced by evolution of OTN standards.  

   This document updates [RFC4328] extending the G.709 ODUk traffic 
   parameters and also presents a new OTN label format which is very 
   flexible and scalable.

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",   
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this   
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

    

3. GMPLS Extensions for the Evolving G.709 - Overview 

   New features for the evolving OTN, for example, new ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 
   and ODUflex containers are specified in [G709-V3]. The corresponding 
   new signal types are summarized below: 

      -  Optical Channel Transport Unit (OTUk): 
         . OTU4 

      -  Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUk): 
         . ODU0 
         . ODU2e 
         . ODU4 
         . ODUflex 

   A new Tributary Slot (TS) granularity (i.e., 1.25 Gbps) is also 
   described in [G709-V3]. Thus, there are now two TS granularities for 
   the foundation OTN ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 containers. The TS granularity 
   at 2.5 Gbps is used on legacy interfaces while the new 1.25 Gbps will 
   be used for the new interfaces. 

   In addition to the support of ODUk mapping into OTUk (k = 1, 2, 3, 4), 
   the evolving OTN [G.709-V3] encompasses the multiplexing of ODUj (j = 
   0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, flex) into an ODUk (k > j), as described in Section 
   3.1.2 of [OTN-frwk]. 

   [RFC4328] describes GMPLS signaling extensions to support the control 
   for G.709 Optical Transport Networks (OTN) [G709-V1]. However, 
   [RFC4328] needs to be updated because it does not provide the means 
   to signal all the new signal types and related mapping and 
   multiplexing functionalities. Moreover, it supports only the 
   deprecated auto-MSI mode which assumes that the Tributary Port Number 
   is automatically assigned in the transmit direction and not checked 
   in the receive direction. 

   This document extends the G.709 traffic parameters described in 
   [RFC4328] and presents a new OTN label format which is very flexible 
   and scalable. Additionally, procedures about Tributary Port Number 
   assignment through control plane are also provided in this document.

4. Extensions for Traffic Parameters for the Evolving G.709 

   The traffic parameters for G.709 are defined as follows: 

      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |  Signal Type  |   Tolerance   |              NMC              | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |              NVC              |        Multiplier (MT)        | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |                            Bit_Rate                           | 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   The Signal Type should be extended to cover the new Signal Type 
   introduced by the evolving OTN. The new Signal Type is extended as 
   follows: 

      Value    Type 
      -----    ---- 
      0        Not significant 
      1        ODU1 (i.e., 2.5 Gbps) 
      2        ODU2 (i.e., 10 Gbps) 
      3        ODU3 (i.e., 40 Gbps) 
      4        ODU4 (i.e., 100 Gbps) 
      5        Reserved (for future use) 
      6        OCh at 2.5 Gbps 
      7        OCh at 10 Gbps 
      8        OCh at 40 Gbps 
      9        OCh at 100 Gbps 
      10~19    Reserved (for future use) 
      20       ODU0 (i.e., 1.25 Gbps) 
      21~30    Reserved (for future use) 
      31       ODU2e (i.e., 10Gbps for FC1200 and GE LAN) 
      32       ODUflex (i.e., 1.25*N Gbps) 
      33~255   Reserved (for future use) 

    

   In case of ODUflex(CBR), the Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields are used 
   together to represent the actual bandwidth of ODUflex, where: 

 
 
Zhang                    Expires April 2011                    [Page 5] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-06.txt               October 2010 


   -  The Bit_Rate field indicates the nominal bit rate of ODUflex(CBR) 
      encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number 
      (referring to [RFC4506] and [IEEE]). 

   -  The Tolerance field indicates the bit rate tolerance (part per 
      million, ppm) of the ODUflex(CBR) encoded as an unsigned integer.  

   For example, for an ODUflex(CBR) service with Bit_Rate = 2.5Gbps and 
   Tolerance = 50ppm, the actual bandwidth of the ODUflex is: 

               2.5Gbps * (1 - 50ppm) ~ 2.5Gbps * (1 + 50ppm) 

   In case of other ODUk signal types, the Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields 
   are not necessary and MUST be filled with 0. 

4.1. Usage of ODUflex Traffic Parameter 

   In case of ODUflex(CBR), the information of Bit_Rate and Tolerance in 
   the ODUflex traffic parameter is used to determine the total number 
   of tributary slots N in the HO ODUk link to be reserved. Here:  

         N = Ceiling of 

   ODUflex(CBR) nominal bit rate * (1 + ODUflex(CBR) bit rate tolerance) 
   --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
       ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 - HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

    
   Therefore, a node receiving a Path message containing ODUflex(CBR) 
   traffic parameter can allocate precise number of tributary slots and 
   set up the cross-connection for the ODUflex service. 

   The table below shows the actual bandwidth of the tributary slot of 
   ODUk (in Gbps), referring to [G709-V3]. 

      ODUk       Minimum          Nominal          Maximum 
      ------------------------------------------------------- 
      ODU2    1.249 384 632    1.249 409 620    1.249 434 608 
      ODU3    1.254 678 635    1.254 703 729    1.254 728 823 
      ODU4    1.301 683 217    1.301 709 251    1.301 735 285 

      Note that: 

      Minimum bandwidth of ODUTk.ts =  
         ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 - HO OPUk bit rate tolerance)

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-06.txt               October 2010 


      Maximum bandwidth of ODTUk.ts = 
         ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 + HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

      Where: HO OPUk bit rate tolerance = 20ppm 

   For different ODUk, the bandwidths of the tributary slot are 
   different, and so the total number of tributary slots to be reserved 
   for the ODUflex(CBR) may not be the same on different HO ODUk links. 
   This is why the traffic parameter should bring the actual bandwidth 
   information other than the NMC field. 

   [Editors note] In case of ODUflex(GFP), the calculation of the total 
   number of tributary slots to be reserved along the path is now under 
   discussion in ITU-T. Therefore, the traffic parameters for 
   ODUflex(GFP) is for further study. 
    

4.2. Example of ODUflex Traffic Parameter 

   This section gives an example to illustrate the usage of ODUflex(CBR) 
   traffic parameter. 

   Assume there is an ODUflex(CBR) service requesting a bandwidth of 
   (2.5Gbps, +/-20ppm) from node A to node C. In other words, the 
   ODUflex traffic parameter indicates that Signal Type is 32 (ODUflex), 
   Bit_Rate is 2.5Gbps and Tolerance is 20ppm.

   -  On the HO ODU4 link between node A and B: 

      The maximum bandwidth of the ODUflex equals 2.5Gbps * (1 + 20ppm), 
      and the minimum bandwidth of the tributary slot of ODU4 equals

      1.301 683 217Gbps, so the total number of tributary slots N1 to 
      be reserved on this link is: 

      N1 = ceiling (2.5Gbps * (1 + 20ppm) / 1.301 683 217) = 2 

   -  On the HO ODU2 link between node B and C: 

      The maximum bandwidth of the ODUflex equals 2.5Gbps * (1 + 20ppm), 
      and the minimum bandwidth of the tributary slot of ODU2 equals 
      1.249 384 632Gbps, so the total number of tributary slots N2 to 
      be reserved on this link is: 

      N2 = ceiling (2.5Gbps * (1 + 20ppm) / 1.249 384 632) = 3 

5. Generalized Label 

   [RFC3471] has defined the Generalized Label which extends the 
   traditional label by allowing the representation of not only labels 
   which travel in-band with associated data packets, but also labels 
   which identify time-slots, wavelengths, or space division multiplexed 
   positions. The format of the corresponding RSVP-TE Generalized Label   
   object is defined in the Section 2.3 of [RFC3473]. 

   However, for different technologies, we usually need use specific 
   label rather than the Generalized Label. For example, the label 
   format described in [RFC4606] could be used for SDH/SONET, the label 
   format in [RFC4328] for G.709. 

   In this document, a new ODUk label format is defined, the information 
   model of which is described in Section 4.10 of [OTN-info]. 

5.1. New definition of ODUk Label  

   In order to be compatible with new types of ODU signal and new types 
   of tributary slot, the following new ODUk label format is defined: 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   | ODUj  |OD(T)Uk| T | Reserved  |           Bit Map             | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                           .........                           | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   ODUj and OD(T)Uk (4 bits respectively): indicate that LO ODUj is 
   multiplexed into HO ODUk(k>j), or LO ODUj is mapped into OTUk (j=k).

   In case of an ODUk mapped into OTUk, it's no need to indicate which 
   tributary slots will be used, so the size of Bit Map is 0. 

   Padded bits are added behind the Bit Map to make the whole label a 
   multiple of four bytes if necessary. Padded bit MUST be set to 0 and 
   MUST be ignored. 

    

5.2. Examples  

   The following examples are given in order to illustrate the label 
   format described in the previous sections of this document. 

   (1) ODUk into OTUk mapping:  

   In such conditions, the downstream node along an LSP returns a label 
   indicating that the ODU1 (ODU2 or ODU3 or ODU4) is directly mapped 
   into the corresponding OTU1 (OTU2 or OTU3 or ODU4). The following 
   example label indicates an ODU1 mapped into OTU1. 

    0                   1                   2                   3

   into several tributary slots of OPUk and then mapped into OTUk. Some 
   instances are shown as follow:

   This above label indicates an ODU2 multiplexed into the 2nd, 3rd, 5th 
   and 7th tributary slot of ODU3, wherein the type of the tributary 
   slot is 2.5Gbps. 

5.3. Label Distribution Procedure 

   This document does not change the existing label distribution 
   procedures [RFC4328] for GMPLS except that the new ODUk label should 
   be processed as follows. 

   When a node receives a generalized label request for setting up an 
   ODUj LSP from its upstream neighbor node, the node should generate an 
   ODU label according to the signal type of the requested LSP and the 
   free resources (i.e., free tributary slots of ODUk) that will be 
   reserved for the LSP, and send the label to its upstream neighbor 
   node. Note that these labels can also be specified by the source node 
   of the connection.  

   In case of ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, the node should firstly 
   determine the size of the Bit Map field according to the signal type 
   and the tributary slot type of ODUk, and then set the bits to 1 in 
   the Bit Map field corresponding to the reserved tributary slots. 

   In case of ODUk to OTUk mapping, the node only needs to fill the ODUj 
   and the ODUk fields with corresponding values in the label. Other 
   bits are reserved and MUST be set to 0. 



 
 
Zhang                    Expires April 2011                   [Page 11] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-06.txt               October 2010 


   When receiving an ODU label from its downstream neighbor node, the 
   node should learn which ODU signal type is multiplexed or mapped into 
   which ODU signal type by analyzing the ODUj and the ODUk fields.  

   In case of ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, the node should firstly 
   determine the size of the Bit Map field according to the signal type 
   and the tributary slot type of ODUk, and then obtain which tributary 
   slots in ODUk are reserved by its downstream neighbor node according 
   to the position of the bits that are set to 1 in the Bit Map field, 
   so that the node can multiplex the ODUj into the reserved tributary 
   slots of ODUk after the LSP is established.  

   In case of ODUk to OTUk mapping, the size of Bit Map field is 0 and 
   no additional procedure is needed. 

5.4. Control Plane Backward Compatibility Considerations 

   Since the [RFC4328] has been deployed in the network for the nodes 
   that support [G709-V1] (herein we call them "legacy nodes"), backward 
   compatibility SHOULD be taken into consideration when the new nodes 
   (i.e., nodes that support [G709-V3]) and the legacy nodes are 
   interworking. 

   For backward compatibility consideration, the new node SHOULD have 
   the ability to generate and parse legacy labels. 

   o  For the legacy node, it always generates and sends legacy label to 
      its upstream node, no matter the upstream node is new or legacy, 
      as described in [RFC4328]. 

   o  For the new node, it will generate and send legacy label if its 
      upstream node is a legacy one, and generate and send new label if 
      its upstream node is a new one. 

   One backwards compatibility example is shown below: 

           Path          Path           Path           Path 
   +-----+ ----> +-----+ ----> +------+ ----> +------+ ----> +-----+ 
   |     |       |     |       |      |       |      |       |     | 
   |  A  +-------+  B  +-------+   C  +-------+   D  +-------+  E  | 
   | new |       | new |       |legacy|       |legacy|       | new | 
   +-----+ <---- +-----+ <---- +------+ <---- +------+ <---- +-----+ 
            Resv          Resv           Resv           Resv 
        (new label)  (legacy label) (legacy label)  (legacy label) 



 
 
Zhang                    Expires April 2011                   [Page 12] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-06.txt               October 2010 


   As described above, for backward compatibility considerations, it is 
   necessary for a new node to know whether the neighbor node is new or 
   legacy. 

   One optional method is manual configuration. But it is recommended to 
   use LMP to discover the capability of the neighbor node automatically, 
   as described in [OTN-LMP].  

   When performing the HO ODU link capability negotiation: 

   o  If the neighbor node only support the 2.5Gbps TS and only support 
      ODU1/ODU2/ODU3, the neighbor node should be treated as a legacy 
      node. 

   o  If the neighbor node can support the 1.25Gbps TS, or can support 
      other LO ODU types defined in [G709-V3]), the neighbor node should 
      be treated as new node. 

   o  If the neighbor node returns a LinkSummaryNack message including 
      an ERROR_CODE indicating nonsupport of HO ODU link capability 
      negotiation, the neighbor node should be treated as a legacy node. 

    

6. Tributary Port Number Assignment 

   When an LO ODUj is multiplexed into HO ODUk occupying one or more TSs, 
   a Tributary Port Number (TPN) is configured at the two end of the HO 
   ODUk link and is put into the related MSI byte(s) in the OPUk 
   overhead at the (traffic) ingress end of the link, so that the other 
   end of the link can learn which TS(s) is/are used by the LO ODUj in 
   the data plane. 

   For HO ODU2 or ODU3 link, the TPN value (6 bits) MUST be different 
   from each other for one type of LO ODU. For HO ODU4 link, the TPN 
   value (7 bits) MUST be different from each other for all types of LO 
   ODUj. 

   Referring to Section 4.2 of [OTN-info], the RSVP-TE signaling is 
   necessary to be extended to support the TPN assignment function. 

6.1. TPN Object 

   A new TPN object is introduced in the PATH and RESV message to 
   support TPN assignment. The TPN object is optional and has the 
   following format:

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-06.txt               October 2010 


   TPN Class-Num = xx (TBD), C_Type = 1 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |D|       Reserved              |             TPN               | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   D (Downstream Assignment) (1 bit): indicates which node to assign the 
   TPN. When set, the TPN is assigned by the downstream node; when 
   cleared, the TPN is assigned by the upstream node.  

   TPN (16 bits): indicates the Tributary Port Number for the assigned 
   Tributary Slot(s).  

      -  In case of LO ODUj multiplexed into HO ODU1/ODU2/ODU3, only the 
         lower 6 bits of TPN field is significant and the other bits of 
         TPN MUST be set to 0. 

      -  In case of LO ODUj multiplexed into HO ODU4, only the lower 7 
         bits of TPN field is significant and the other bits of TPN MUST 
         be set to 0.  

      -  In case of ODUj mapped into OTUk (j=k), the TPN is not needed 
         and this object SHOULD not appear in the RSVP-TE message. 

    

6.2. Procedure of TPN Assignment 

   Since the TPN is not needed in case of ODU mapping, the following 
   sub-sessions are only applicable for the ODU multiplexing cases.  

6.2.1. Downstream Node Assignment by Control Plane 

   In this case, the upstream node sends a PATH message, which contains 
   a TPN Object with the D bit set to 1, to its downstream neighbor node 
   to request creation of LO ODUj. The TPN field in this object is set 
   to 0 and MUST be ignored. 

   On receiving the PATH massage, the downstream neighbor node performs 
   a normal tributary slot selection and reservation in the selected HO 
   ODUk link. After that, the downstream node assigns a valid TPN, which 
   does not collided with other TPN value used by existing LO ODU 
   connections in the selected HO ODU link and configures the expected 
   multiplex structure identifier (ExMSI) using this TPN. Then, the 

 
 
Zhang                    Expires April 2011                   [Page 14] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-06.txt               October 2010 


   assigned TPN is filled into the TPN Object and sent to the upstream 
   neighbor node via the RESV message. 

   The upstream node, when receiving the RESV message, gets the TPN 
   assigned by its downstream neighbor node and fills the TPN into the 
   related MSI byte(s) in the OPUk overhead in the data plane, so that 
   the downstream neighbor node can check whether the TPN received from 
   the data plane is consistent with the ExMSI and determine whether 
   there is any mismatch defect. 

6.2.2. Upstream Node Assignment by Control Plane 

   In this case, the upstream node performs a normal tributary slot 
   selection and reservation in the selected HO ODUk link for LO ODUj, 
   and then assigns a valid TPN, which does not collided with other TPN 
   value used by existing LO ODU connections in the selected HO ODU link, 
   for the reserved tributary slot(s).  

   Then, the upstream node sends a PATH message, which contains the 
   assigned TPN value in the TPN Object (D = 0) and contains the 
   selected tributary slots information (e.g., via the existing 
   LABEL_SET Object), to its downstream neighbor node to request 
   creation of LO ODUj. 

   The downstream neighbor node, based on the received tributary slots 
   information and the TPN value, configures the ExMSI in the data plane, 
   so that the data plane MSI procedure can be performed, as described 
   in the previous sub-session. 

6.3. Collision Management 

   [Editors note] This chapter should indicate the procedure in case of 
   collision between Tributary Port Numbers and/or Tributary Slots e.g. 
   two different LSP setups may choose a disjoint set of Tributary Slots 
   but they may request the same Tributary Port Number value (same MSI 
   in G.709 OPUk field). 

   In this case the first signaling should be successful and the second 
   one must fail. 
    

7. Security Considerations 

   This document introduces no new security considerations to the 
   existing GMPLS signaling protocols. Referring to [RFC3473], further 
   details of the specific security measures are provided. Additionally,

   [GMPLS-SEC] provides an overview of security vulnerabilities and 
   protection mechanisms for the GMPLS control plane. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   -  TPN Object: 

       A new value is needed to be defined by IANA for this document: 

       o TPN Object (Session 6): Class-Num = xx (TBD), C-Type = 1 

   -  G.709 SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects: 

       The traffic parameters, which are carried in the G.709 
       SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects, do not require any new object 
       class and type based on [RFC4328]: 

       o G.709 SENDER_TSPEC Object: Class = 12, C-Type = 5 [RFC4328] 

       o G.709 FLOWSPEC Object: Class = 9, C-Type = 5 [RFC4328] 

   -  Generalized Label Object: 

       The new defined ODU label (session 5) is a kind of generalized 
       label. Therefore, the Class-Num and C-Type of the ODU label is 
       the same as that of generalized label described in [RFC3473], 
       i.e., Class-Num = 16, C-Type = 2.
