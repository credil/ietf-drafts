Internet-Draft       SIP Forum UA Config Service Tag       November 2009


1.  Introduction

   The SIP Forum [1] User Agent Configuration Recommendation [SFUACFG]
   defines a procedure for SIP [RFC3261] User Agents to

   1.  determine the SIP domain from which to request configuration,

   2.  locate one or more server(s) that provide the configuration
       service for that domain,

   3.  construct a URL for and request configuration from that service,

   4.  request that the service send notices of any changes to that
       configuration.

   Two of the steps in this process are accomplished in whole or in part
   using DDDS Applications.

   The first step, determining the SIP domain from which to request
   configuration, allows for multiple mechanisms; one of the mechanisms
   uses as input a string of decimal numbers to identify the SIP domain.
   This string is called a "SIPForum Provider Alias Number" (SPAN).  The
   SPAN is resolved to a DNS domain name using a DDDS application,
   described in section Section 2.

   The second step, locating the configuration service for a given
   domain, resolves a configuration service domain name to an https base
   URL by using the U-NAPTR (URI-Enabled NAPTR) application defined in
   [RFC4848], which builds upon the S-NAPTR (Simple NAPTR) application
   defined in [RFC3958].  This domain to URL resolution DDDS application
   is described in section Section 3.

   This document registers the application service tags for these
   applications.


2.  SFUA:PAN Application Service Tag Registration

   This document registers the following S-NAPTR application service
   tag:

                  +-------------------------+-----------+
                  | Application Service Tag | SFUA:PAN  |
                  | Defining Publication    | [SFUACFG] |
                  +-------------------------+-----------+

3.  SFUA:CFG Application Service Tag Registration

   This document registers the following U-NAPTR application service
   tag:

                  +-------------------------+-----------+
                  | Application Service Tag | SFUA:CFG  |
                  | Defining Publication    | [SFUACFG] |
                  +-------------------------+-----------+


4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the various parts of the SIP Forum
   User Agent Configuration Recommendation are discussed in its defining
   specification: [SFUACFG].  There are no known security implications
   of registering these specific application service tag values.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests registration of the Application Service Tag
   values "SFUA:PAN" and "SFUA:CFG" in the registry defined by
   [RFC3958].
