      <t>The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks
	  defines a generic Distance Vector protocol for Low Power and 
	  Lossy Networks, many of which exhibit strongly asymmetrical

	  optimizes RPL operations whereby upwards and downwards direction-optimized
	  RPL instances are associated.

    <section title="Introduction">
		<t>The IETF ROLL Working Group has defined
		application-specific routing requirements for a Low Power and Lossy
		Network (LLN) routing protocol, specified in 
		<xref      target="RFC5548"></xref>,  
		<xref      target="RFC5673"></xref>, 
		<xref      target="RFC5826"></xref>, and 
		<xref      target="RFC5867"></xref>,
		many of which explicitly or implicitly refer to links with
		asymmetrical properties.
		</t>
		<t>Upon those requirements, the <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"> 
		Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Network</xref> 
		was designed as a platform that can be extended by further specifications or
		guidances, by adding new metrics, Objective Functions, or additional options.</t>
	  
		<t>RPL forms Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs) within instances
		of the protocol. Each instance is associated with an Objective Function that is 
		designed to solve the problem that is addressed by that instance.</t>
	
		<t>In one hand, RPL requires bidirectional links for the control, but on the other,
		there is no requirement that the properties of a link are the same in both directions.
		In fact, such a symmetry is rarely present in LLNs, whether links are based on radios 
		or power-line.</t>
	
		<t>Some initial implementations require that the quality of both directions of a link
		is evaluated as very good so that the link can be used for control and data in both
		directions. This eliminates asymmetrical links that are very good in one direction, 
		but only good enough for scarce activity in the other direction.</t>
	
		<t>In practice, a DAG that is built to optimize upwards traffic is generally not 
		congruent with a DAG that is built to optimize downwards traffic. This is why
		this specification is designed to enable asymmetrical routing DAGs that are bound 
		together to get the maximum benefits of all bidirectional links.</t>
 
    </section>

    <section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>The terminology used in this document is consistent with and
      incorporates that described in `Terminology in Low power And Lossy
      Networks' <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-terminology"></xref>
	  and <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/>.</t>
	  <t>The term upwards qualifies a link, a DODAG or an instance that is optimal for 
	  sending traffic in the general direction of the root, 
	  though may be usable but suboptimal for traffic coming form the
	  direction of the root. The term downwards
	  qualifies the same words for the opposite direction.</t>
	  
	  <t>The term parenting applied to instances refers to the directional association 
	  of two instances. The graph formed by parented instances must be a DAG. Traffic
	  may be transferred from an instance onto a parent instance under specified 
	  circumstances.
	  </t>
	  
    </section>
	
    <section title="The asymmetrical link problem">
		  
    </section>
	
	
    <section title="Solution Overview">
		  
		<t>With the core RPL specification, <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/>
		each instance is a separate routing topology, and packets must 
		be forwarded within the same topology / same instance.  One direct
		consequence of that design choice is that a topology must be very
		good for both upwards and downwards traffic; otherwise, traffic between
		two nodes in the instance may suffer.
		</t>
		   
		<t>   A simple approach to address bidirectional but asymmetrical links
		with RPL is to construct two DAGs, one for upwards traffic and one
		for downwards traffic, each DAG a separate instance, and then bind
		the two together.  In order to benefit from both instances for a same
		packet, this solution extends RPL to allow traffic to be transferred
		from one instance to the next.</t>
		   
		<t>It can be noted at this point that with <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/>,
		traffic that goes down does not generally go back up again, whereas P2P 
		traffic within a DODAG might go up to a common parent and then down
		to the destination. In terms of instance relationship, this means
		that when an upwards and a downwards instance are bound together,
		traffic from the former may be transferred to the latter, but not
		the other way around.  In other words, there is an order, a
		parent-child relationship, between the two instances.
		</t>
		
		<t>Additionally, if there is no next-hop for a packet going down within 
		the instance, then with <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/> the packet 
		must be dropped. In order to limit that risk, it is
		tempting though inefficient to lower the constraints that are applied
		to build the topology. It can be more efficient to actually keep the
		constraints as they should be, but, instead, enable a less constrained,
		more spanning, fall-back topology into which traffic can be transferred.
		</t>
		
		<t>For that reason, this solution allows for more complex instance
		relationships than plain child-parent associations.  In order to
		avoids loops which could be created when transferring packets from
		one instance to the next, this solution requires that the instances
		be themselves organized as a superior Directed Acyclic Graph, and
		enforce that inter-DAG transfers occur only within that superior
		super-DAG of DAG instances.
		</t>

             title="Modified DODAG Information Object (DIO)">
        <t>The DODAG Information Object  <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"/> 
		carries information that allows a node to discover a RPL Instance, 
		learn its configuration parameters, select a DODAG parent set, and 
		maintain the DODAG. This specification defines a new flag bit to 
		indicate that the DAG is directional.</t>

    <section anchor="back" title="Backward compatibility">
		<t>An OF is generally designed to compute a Rank of a directional
		link in a fashion that is diffent from a bidirectional link, and 
		in particular will not use the same metrics and thusobtain different
		ranks for a same situation. For that 
		reason, it is important that the OF is aware that an instance is
		supposed to define a directional DODAG, and it is RECOMMENDED that 
		only devices that support directional DODAGs are allowed in a directional
		instance. </t>
		<t>It might happen that for some purposes like higher availability,
		an implementation that does not support directional links is administratively 
		allowed to join a directional DODAG. In that case, the extension of the DODAG that starts
		at that device will not be directional, but the instance will still be functional. </t>
		<t>In that case, it might also happen that a device that supports directional DODAGs
		per this specification sees candidate neighbors that expose the Directional flag
		and some others that do not. An OF that supports directional links
		SHOULD favor directional links over non directional links, in a fashion
		that is to be specified with the OF. In the case of <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-of0">
		OF0 </xref>, the 'D' flag should be accounted for before the computation of item 8
		in the "Selection Of The Preferred Parent" section 4.2.1., that is before Ranks and
		be calculated and compared.
