Internet-Draft            BFCP Control Package             February 2008


1.  Introduction

   The SIP Control Framework [11] provides a generic approach for
   establishment and reporting capabilities of remotely initiated
   commands.  The Framework utilizes many functions provided by the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [4] for the rendezvous and
   establishment of a reliable channel for control interactions.  The
   Control Framework also introduces the concept of a Control Package.
   A Control Package is an explicit usage of the Control Framework for a
   particular interaction set.  This specification defines a package for
   floor control in conferences based on the use of the Binary Floor
   Control Protocol (BFCP) [8].


2.  Conventions

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [2] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.


3.  Terminology

   TBD.


4.  Overview

   The SIP Control Framework [11] provides a generic approach for
   establishment and reporting capabilities of remotely initiated
   commands.  The Framework utilizes many functions provided by the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [4] for the rendezvous and
   establishment of a reliable channel for control interactions.  The
   Control Framework also introduces the concept of a Control Package.
   A Control Package is an explicit usage of the Control Framework for a
   particular interaction set.  This specification defines a package for
   floor control in conferences based on the use of the Binary Floor
   Control Protocol (BFCP) [8].

   Floor control is needed whenever access to a resource, or set of
   resources, needs to be moderated.  A typical example is the right to
   talk in a conference.  In such a scenario, a participant willing to
   talk would first have to place a request concerning the floor
   associated with such audio resource.  The participant would then be
   added to the conference mix only when his request has been granted,
   by the server itself or by a designated chair.  RFC4582 [8] defines a

Internet-Draft            BFCP Control Package             February 2008


   Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) to specifically deal with such a
   need.  It defines all the relevant entities (floors, queues,
   requests) and related actors (floor control servers, participants and
   chairs).  So, the scope of this package is adding BFCP-based floor
   control functionality to complementary packages that might need it,
   as the Conference Control Package [13].

   In particular, this package aims at dealing with the case where the
   Floor Control Server (FCS), as defined in [8], is co-located with the
   Media Server (MS).  In fact, if the FCS were co-located with the
   Application Server (AS), floor control would be part of the AS
   application logic, and consequently out of scope for the MS.
   Considering users are added by the AS to the MS by means of a 3PCC
   [6] mechanism, a way to include BFCP negotiation is needed.  In fact,
   users willing to act as floor participants will need to be made aware
   of all the relevant identifiers (i.e. the transport address of the
   floor control server, the BFCP conference ID associated with the mix,
   the BFCP user ID the user has been assigned, all the floor
   identifiers and their mapping with existing resources, and so on) to
   opportunely interact with a floor control server.  To achieve this,
   RFC4583 [8] provides with a way to negotiate BFCP connections within
   the context of a SDP offer/answer [5].


5.  Control Package Definition

   This section fulfills the mandatory requirement for information that
   MUST be specified during the definition of a Control Framework
   Package, as detailed in Section 9 of [11].

5.1.  Control Package Name

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify and register a unique name and version.

   The name and version of this Control Package is "msc-conf-bfcp/1.0"
   (Media Server Control - Conferencing - BFCP - version 1.0 ).

5.2.  Framework Message Usage

   BFCP functionality includes several different capabilities.  There
   must be means to appropriately create, modify and destroy each of the
   available resources.  This includes means to create a BFCP conference
   with specified settings, adding and removing floors to the
   conference, setting or unsetting designated chairs for such floors
   and so on.

   This package defines XML elements in Section 6 and provides an XML



Miniero, et al.          Expires August 15, 2008                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            BFCP Control Package             February 2008


   Schema in Section 8.  Additionally, some examples are provided in
   Section 7.

   The XML elements in this package are split into requests, responses
   and event notifications.  Requests are carried in CONTROL message
   bodies; <moderateconference> and <addfloor> elements are examples of
   package requests.  Responses are carried either in REPORT message or
   Control Framework 200 response bodies; the <response> element is
   defined as a package response.  Event notifications are also carried
   in REPORT message bodies; the <event> element is defined for package
   event notifications.  Event subscription is accomplished by means of
   the <subscribe> element.

   Note that package responses are different from framework response
   codes.  Framework error response codes (see Section 8 of [11]) are
   used when the request or event notification is invalid; for example,
   a request is invalid XML (400), or not understood (500).  Package
   responses are carried in 200 response or REPORT message bodies.  This
   package's response codes are defined in Section 6.2.1.

   The schema uses the "connection-id" and "conf-id" attributes which
   are imported from the schema defined in the core Control Framework
   [11].

5.3.  Common XML Support

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify if the attributes for media dialog or conference references
   are required.

   This package requires that the XML Schema in Section 16.1 of [11]
   MUST be supported for media dialogs and conferences.

5.4.  CONTROL Message Body

   A valid CONTROL body message MUST conform to the schema defined in
   Section 8 and described in Section 6.  XML messages appearing in
   CONTROL messages MUST contain one of the elements described in
   Section 6.1.

5.5.  REPORT Message Body

   A valid REPORT body MUST conform to the schema defined in Section 8
   and described in Section 6.  XML messages appearing in REPORT
   messages MUST contain a <response> (Section 6.2.1), or a
   (notification) <event> element (Section 6.3.2).

6.  Element Definitions

   This section defines the XML messages for this control package.

   [Editors Note: since XML Schema may not be able to express all
   constraints expressed in these definitions, in cases where there is a
   difference in constraints, the definitions in the section take
   priority.]

6.1.  Requests

   The following request elements are defined:

   <moderateconference>:  create and configure a new BFCP conference,
      associated with an existing framework conference instance to
      moderate - see Section 6.1.1 for details;

   <unmoderateconference>:  destroy a BFCP conference, thus stopping the
      moderation of the associated framework conference instance - see
      Section 6.1.2 for details;

   <addfloor>:  add and configure a new floor to an existing BFCP
      conference - see Section 6.1.3 for details;

   <modifyfloor>:  modify the configuration of a currently handled floor
      in an existing BFCP conference - see Section 6.1.4 for details;

   <removefloor>:  remove a currently handled floor from an existing
      BFCP conference - see Section 6.1.5 for details;

   <addparticipant>:  add a floor participant to a BFCP conference - see
      Section 6.1.6 for details;

   <removeparticipant>:  remove a floor participant from a BFCP
      conference - see Section 6.1.7 for details.

6.1.1.  <moderateconference>

   <moderateconference> is used in a request by the AS to moderate an
   existing conference instance, by associating to it a new, properly
   configured, BFCP conference.

   The <moderateconference> element has the following attributes:








Miniero, et al.          Expires August 15, 2008                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            BFCP Control Package             February 2008


   conf-id:  string indicating the name of the conference to moderate.
      The conference MUST be known by the receiving entity or else a 404
      'Conference does not exist' package level error will be generated.
      This attribute is mandatory.

   bfcp-conf-id:  string (an unsigned integer) indicating a unique name
      for the BFCP conference.  If this attribute is not specified, the
      MS creates a unique name for the BFCP conference.  The value is
      used in subsequent references to the conference (e.g. as bfcp-
      conf-id in a <response>).  When present in a <moderateconference>
      request, the new value of this attribute MUST be unique or else a
      403 'Conference already exists' package level error will be
      reported.  The attribute is optional.

   Additionally, to configure the new BFCP conference, the
   <moderateconference> element has the following child elements
   defined:

   <floor>:  an element to configure a floor in the new BFCP conference
      (see Section 6.4.1 for more details).  This element only refers to
      floors already available at creation time.  New floors can still
      be added subsequently by means of an <addfloor> request (see
      Section 6.1.3).  This element is optional.

   <subscribe>:  an element to request subscription to conference
      events. (see Section 6.3.1 for more details).  This element is
      optional.

   Multiple <floor> elements may be defined, in case several floors are
   needed.

   When a MS has finished processing a <moderateconference> request, it
   MUST reply with an appropriate <response> element (Section 6.2.1).

6.1.2.  <unmoderateconference>

   <unmoderateconference> is used in a request by the AS to destroy a
   BFCP conference, thus stopping the moderatation of the associated
   existing framework conference instance.  A successful processing of
   this request does NOT result in a destruction of the associated media
   conference: it only results in the media conference not being
   moderated by means of BFCP anymore.  The actual destruction of the
   media conference itself is accomplished through the means provided in
   [13].

   The <unmoderateconference> element has the following attributes:





Miniero, et al.          Expires August 15, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            BFCP Control Package             February 2008


   bfcp-conf-id:  string indicating the name of the BFCP conference to
      destroy.  The conference MUST be known by the receiving entity or
      else a 404 'Conference does not exist' package level error will be
      generated.  This attribute is mandatory.

   The <unmoderateconference> element does not specify any child
   elements.

   When a MS has finished processing an <unmoderateconference> request,
   it MUST reply with an appropriate <response> element (Section 6.2.1).

6.1.3.  <addfloor>

   <addfloor> is used in a request by the AS to add one or more floors
   to an existing BFCP conference instance.

   The <addfloor> element has the following attributes:

   bfcp-conf-id:  string indicating the name of the BFCP conference to
      add the floor(s) to.  The conference MUST be known by the
      receiving entity or else a 404 'Conference does not exist' package
      level error will be generated.  This attribute is mandatory.

   Additionally, to configure the new floor(s), the <addfloor> element
   has the following child elements defined:

   <floor>:  an element to configure a new floor in the specified BFCP
      conference (see Section 6.4.1 for more details).  This element is
      mandatory.
   Multiple <floor> elements may be defined, in case several floors are
   to be added at the same time.

   When a MS has finished processing a <addfloor> request, it MUST reply
   with an appropriate <response> element (Section 6.2.1).

6.1.4.  <modifyfloor>

   <removefloor> is used in a request by the AS to remove an existing
   floor from the BFCP conference instance it is in.  A successful
   processing of this request does NOT result in a destruction of the
   associated resource (or set of resources): it only results in the
   associated resource not being moderated by means of BFCP anymore.
   The actual destruction of the resource (in case it is directly
   handled and manipulated by the MS itself) is accomplished through the
   means provided in [13].

   The <removefloor> element has the following attributes:

Internet-Draft            BFCP Control Package             February 2008


   bfcp-conf-id:  string indicating the name of the BFCP conference to
      remove the floor from.  The conference MUST be known by the
      receiving entity or else a 404 'Conference does not exist' package
      level error will be generated.  This attribute is mandatory.

   bfcp-floor-id:  string indicating the name of the BFCP floor to
      remove.  The floor MUST be known by the receiving entity or else a
      404 'Floor does not exist' package level error will be generated.
      This attribute is mandatory.

   The <removefloor> element does not specify any child elements.

   When a MS has finished processing a <removefloorfloor> request, it
   MUST reply with an appropriate <response> element (Section 6.2.1).

6.1.5.  <removefloor>

   <modifyfloor> is used in a request by the AS to modify the
   configuration of a floor in an existing BFCP conference instance.

   The <modifyfloor> element has the following attributes:

   bfcp-conf-id:  string indicating the name of the BFCP conference to
      modify the floor's in.  The conference MUST be known by the
      receiving entity or else a 404 'Conference does not exist' package
      level error will be generated.  This attribute is mandatory.

   bfcp-floor-id:  string indicating the name of the BFCP floor to
      modify the floor.  The floor MUST be known by the receiving entity
      or else a 404 'Floor does not exist' package level error will be
      generated.  This attribute is mandatory.

   Additionally, to modify the configuration of the floor, the
   <modifyfloor> element has the following child elements defined:

   <floor>:  an element to configure the specified floor in the
      specified BFCP conference (see Section 6.4.1 for more details).
      This element is mandatory.

   It is an error if the provided <floor> element conflicts with the
   BFCP floor identifier attribute.

   When a MS has finished processing a <modifyfloor> request, it MUST
   reply with an appropriate <response> element (Section 6.2.1).

6.1.7.  <removeparticipant>

   TBD. (is this really needed? there's RFC4583 for that...)

6.2.  Responses

   All responses to the previously described requests are specified in a
   <response> element.  This element may be contained in the body either
   of a REPORT framework message or in a 200 framework message.

6.2.1.  <response>

   Reponses to requests are indicated by a <response> element.

   The <response> element has the following attributes:

   status:  numeric code indicating the response status.  This attribute
      is mandatory.

   reason:  string specifying a human readable description of the reason
      for the response status.  This attribute is optional.

   bfcp-conf-id:  string identifying the BFCP conference the request
      referred to.  This attribute is optional.

   bfcp-floor-id:  string identifying the BFCP floor the request
      referred to.  This attribute is optional.

   The following status codes are defined:

6.3.  Notifications

   In case the a controlling client is interested in receiving events
   regarding a BFCP conference, a notification mechanism is provided in
   the package.  The client requests subscription to such events by
   adding a <subscribe> child element to the <moderateconference>
   request, whereas the MS triggers the related events in subsequent
   REPORT messages.  Event notifications are then delivered using the
   <event> element.

6.3.1.  <subscribe>

   BFCP event notifications are defined when a controlling client
   subscribes to notifications for BFCP-related events using the
   <subscribe> element in a <moderateconference> request.

   The <subscribe> element has no attributes, but has the following
   child elements defined:

   <notify>:  contains the following attributes:
      name  a string indicating the name of the event to be notified.
         The attribute is mandatory.

   Multiple <notify> elements may be specified.

   The MS would then use the <event> element to send notifications to
   the controlling client.

6.3.2.  <event>

   Delivery of events the AS subscribed for is accomplished by means of
   an <event> element.

   The <event> element has the following attributes:

   name:  string indicating the name of the BFCP event.  This attribute
      is mandatory.

6.4.  Floors Manipulation

   Floors are defined as tokens associated with a resource, or set of
   resources, in order to moderate the access to their functionality by
   users.  This introduces the need for a mechanism in the package to
   properly take care of this kind of association, especially when
   dealing about resources directly manipulated by the Media Server
   (e.g. andio and video).

   Let's consider the following figure, which presents the view of an
   audio conference with three participants, and the related media
   labels associated with each participant's media stream:



                                    MS
                             +---------------+

                             |       x       |
                             |       |       |
                             +-------+-------+

                                     |

                  Figure 1: Audio Conference with labels

   Even if each participant sees a different label for the stream he has
   with the mixer, the floor associated with the only available resource
   in the conference (audio) is the same.  This means that the package
   needs to have a way to address each resource in the conference
   according to how it is defined in [13], e.g. "associate media 'audio'
   with floor 11".  Once a participant's media stream is attached to the
   resource, the related label is consequently associated with the floor
   as specified in [9].  Figure 2 depicts such the case where all the
   participants have been attached to the mix.

             Figure 2: Audio Conference with labels and floors

   The same approach can be considered when dealing with different
   floors associated with one or more different resources, e.g.
   conferences with an audio and a video stream, conferences with two
   different audio streams, and so on.  Each floor needs to be
   unambiguously associated with a subset of the available resources
   (e.g. floor 11 is audio1 and floor 22 is video, or floor 11 is audio1
   while floor 22 is audio2, or floor 11 is audio1 AND audio2 AND
   video2, and so on).

   To achieve this, each floor, together with its configuration, is
   defined in the package by the <floor> element.

6.4.1.  <floor>

   The <floor> element is used in the package to configure a floor in a
   BFCP conference.  It addresses all the relevant settings for a floor,
   including the resource (or, again, set of resources) it must be
   associated with, the maximum number of users that can be granted the
   floor at the same time, the maximum number of requests the same
   participant can place for this floor at the same time, and the
   default policy the FCS considers for incoming requests about the
   floor.

   The <floor> element has the following attributes:

   bfcp-floor-id:  string indicating the name of the BFCP floor.  This
      attribute is optional.

Internet-Draft            BFCP Control Package             February 2008


   <media>:  an element indicating the type of media associated with the
      floor, i.e. the resource associated with the floor, as defined in
      [13].  The string might be a comma-separated list in case the
      floor is associated with more than one resource (e.g.
      media="audio,video").  This element is mandatory.

   <max-users>:  an element indicating the maximum number of users that
      can be granted this floor at the same time: this basically sets
      the size of the granted floor queue.  In case all the queue slots
      have already been granted, subsequent requests are put on hold.
      This element is optional: if missing, the default value (max-
      users="1") is used.

   <max-requests>:  an element indicating the maximum number of requests
      each user can place for the floor before being granted it.  This
      element is optional: if missing, the default value (max-
      requests"="1) is used.

   <policy>:  an element indicating the default policy the FCS must take
      whenever receiving requests for this floor and the chair is
      missing.  In fact, in case a chair is involved, the request is
      forwarded to him, which then takes a decision about it.  The
      policy can be an 'autodeny' (deny all the requests for this
      floor), 'autoaccept' (accept all the requests for this floor) or
      'ignore' (ignore all the requests for this floor and put them on
      ice, waiting for a chair to appear) policy.  This element is
      optional: if missing, the default value (policy="autoaccept") is
      used.

   The "bfcp-floor-id" attribute has different roles according to the
   request the <floor> element is part of.  The behaviour of the package
   changes accordingly.  Specifically:

   <moderateconference|addfloor>:  if the attribute is not specified,
      the MS creates a unique name for the BFCP floor.  The value is
      used in subsequent references to the conference (e.g. as bfcp-
      floor-id in a <modifyfloor>).  The new value of this attribute
      MUST be unique or else a 403 'Floor already exists' package level
      error will be reported.

   <modifyfloor>:  if the attribute is not specified, the value of the
      attribute in the father element is used.  If it is specified,
      instead, it must not conflict with the value of the attribute in
      the father element, otherwise it is an error.

   TBD.  Elaborate the floor mechanism.
