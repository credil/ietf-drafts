Call Park and Call Retrieve are useful telephony services that are
familiar to many users.  Existing implementations using the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) show that a variety of approaches can be
taken, with varying degrees of interoperability.  This draft discusses a
number of feature variations, and how they may be implemented using
existing techniques.  An additional URI parameter is also described,
which enables further common use-cases to be implemented.
</t></abstract>

<section title="Overview">
<t>
Call Park is a feature that enables UAs to make a call inactive
but not terminated, in such a way as to allow the call to be resumed
by the UA that parked the call, or by a different UA.
</t>
<t>
This feature is typically used when User A wishes to transfer a call in
progress to User B, but doesn't necessarily know how to reach User B's
UA directly.  In this situation, User A parks the call, and then tells
User B where the call is parked.  User B may then retrieve the call
using a convenient UA.
</t>
<t>
Other uses include allowing multiple calls to be parked at the same
'location', and forming a queue.  In this way, a simple 'ACD' (Automatic
Call Distribution) system can
be implemented that permits calls to be initially sorted and placed in
one of a number of queues, ready to be handled when an appropriate agent
becomes available (and retrieves the next call from the queue).
</t>
<t>
In all cases, the parked call is subsequently identifiable by a short
(typically 3 or 4 digit) label known as an 'orbit'.  This orbit is often
allocated by the user parking the call, but some environments favour
allocation of the orbit by a Park Server.  Both approaches are described
in this document.
</t>
<t>
Multiple Park Servers can be beneficial in some enviroments for a
variety of reasons including load-sharing and administrative policies.
This document shows how support for multiple servers can easily be
achieved whilst still permitting a single 'well-known' Park Server URI
to be advertised for configuration.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Parking a call">
<t>
A basic call flow for Call Park is given in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples"/>
(section 2.15), and this forms the basis of the feature.
The flow shows Alice and Bob in a call, when Bob decides to park the
call by sending a REFER to the Park Server.
</t>
<t>
It is worth noting that whilst the flow is conceptually similar to an 
Unattended Transfer 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples"/> (section 2.4), the
REFER is sent to different endpoints in the two cases.  For Unattended
Transfer, the Transferor sends the REFER to the Transferee, instructing
him to call the Transfer Target.
For Call Park, the Transferor (Bob) sends the REFER to the Transfer
Target (Park Server), instructing it to call the Transferee (Alice).
</t>
<t>
By following the Call Park model, we ensure that Bob has 
visibility over the success or failure of the park attempt.  We also
ensure that Bob does not rely on Alice to correctly pass the orbit
parameter back from the Park Server for the centrally-allocated orbit
number situation.  Finally, because Bob sends the REFER to the
Park Server, we give the Park Server the opportunity to challenge Bob
and ensure that appropriate authorisation exists for the feature.

<t>
The basic call flow described above uses the 
SIP dialog ID between the parked endpoint and the Park Server itself as
the unique parked call identifier.  Using the dialog ID has a number of
advantages since it is unique and allocated by both the parked user and
the Park Server.  However, it is also long, which can lead to problems
when trying to identify parked calls by verbal or human-written
mechanisms.
</t>
<t>
Traditional PBX users have become accustomed to calls being parked
against a short number (typically 3 or 4 digits), and then using this
identifier to communicate to the retrieving party which call to
retrieve.  This information may be passed verbally, or by means of
small paper notes.  Whilst collisions may occur, they are generally
avoided satisfactorily by administrative policies.
</t>
<t>
This draft attempts to reconcile these two models by allowing a short
label to be attached to a parked call (the 'orbit').  The retrieving
party can then use the same label to locate the relevant dialog ID in
order to retrieve the parked call.  Note that the orbit may be allocated
by the User Agent parking the call or centrally by the Park Server.
</t>

<section title="Parking a call without an orbit">
<t>
Certain environments do not require an 'orbit' to be used, either
because calls are parked in a single queue, or the dialog identifiers
are readily passed between concerned UAs.  In this scenario, the flow
described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples"/> 
(section 2.15) is followed without deviation.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Parking a call with an orbit specified by the UA">
<t>
The message flow of parking a call in this scenario is identical to
that illustrated in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples"/>
(section 2.15).  The difference that this document introduces is in the 
REFER message to the Park Server.
</t>

<t>
In this scenario, it is assumed that Bob has entered a parking orbit in
some manner appropriate to his UA.  Once this is done, the REFER is sent to the
URI &lt;sips:park@server.example.com;orbit=1234&gt; instead of simply
directing the request to the URI &lt;sips:park@server.example.com&gt;.
The addition of the orbit parameter to the URI effectively labels the parked
call with a short memorable code entered by the user.

<section title="Parking a call with an orbit specified by the Park Server">
<t>
Sometimes an orbit number assignment policy needs to be implemented.
This may be to ensure that all orbit numbers are a particular length,
or have a form that means that they can be dialled directly (given
suitable extensions to an Application Server).  It may also be
implemented to eliminate the problem of trying to park more than one
call on the same orbit.
</t>
<t>
To enforce a policy, we ensure that the orbit number is not allocated
by the UA (entered by the user, or by configuration etc.)  but is
instead allocated by the Park Server, and relayed to the UA.  The
approach taken here is analogous to the Conference Factory approach
described in <xref target="RFC4579"/>.  Bob sends a REFER to
the preconfigured Park Server URI, but without any 'orbit' parameter
added.  The Park Server then responds by redirecting Bob to the correct
orbit by using a '302 Moved Temporarily' response.  The orbit can then
be found by inspecting this new target.

<t>
This is also the means by which multiple Park Servers can be deployed.
A REFER to &lt;sips:park@server.example.com&gt; might result in a 302 
response, nominating &lt;sips:park@server-1.example.com;orbit=1234&gt;
as the desired target.
</t>

<t>
Different network architectures may result in different behaviours as
seen by Bob.  In particular, whether Bob sees the 302 response will
depend on whether or not an intermediate proxy recurses on it.
Therefore, Bob's UA must be prepared to extract the orbit parameter from
either the 302 response (if one is seen) or the Contact header of the
2xx response to his REFER.
</t>

<t>
Since this technique may also be used to resolve the problem of parking
multiple calls on the same orbit, Bob's UA must be prepared to extract the
orbit even if it provided one in the initial request.  If the orbit
differs to the one requested, the extracted orbit should be rendered to
Bob in an appropriate manner.

<t>
This variation is only possible on Park Servers capable of generating
Contact URIs of the correct form, i.e. with an 'orbit' URI parameter, in
either a 302 response, or in a 2xx response to the REFER.
Park Servers unable to generate URIs of this form are therefore confined
to environments that don't require centrally allocated parking orbits.

<section title="A failed attempt to park a call">
<t>
A Park Server may choose to reject a park attempt for many reasons,
including prohibiting multiple calls being parked against the same
orbit, or prohibiting certain users from parking calls on certain
orbits.  Whatever the reason, the response sent to Bob will enable Bob
to take appropriate action.  The following example shows the Park Server
rejecting a call due to the orbit already being in use.

<t>
When Bob's parking attempt is rejected, Bob may choose to attempt to park
the call again, but using a different orbit number.  The ability for Bob
to recover from failed parking attempts such as this without dropping the 
call to Alice is an important consequence of Bob sending the REFER to the
Park Server, rather than sending the REFER to Alice so that she can park
herself.
</t>
</section>

</section>	<!-- Parking a call -->

<section title="Retrieving a Parked Call">
<t>
In order to retrieve a parked call, Carol needs to obtain the dialog 
identifiers for the dialog between Alice and wherever Alice is parked.
</t>
<t>
The dialog identifiers can be obtained by issuing a SUBSCRIBE for the
dialog event package <xref target="RFC4235"/>.  The resulting NOTIFY
will contain details of all pertinent calls, including the dialog
identifiers.  Carol may (if presented with multiple dialogs) choose
which call to retrieve.  Many implementations choose the first dialog
listed, although some use the &lt;duration&gt; element to identify which
call has been parked for the longest time.  Obtaining the dialog information in
this way follows the flow described in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples" /> (section 2.15).
</t>

<t>
By subscribing to the dialog event package <xref target="RFC4235"/>
at the same URI used for parking the call, i.e.
&lt;sips:park-server@example.com;orbit=1234&gt;, all the information that
is required for the call to be retrieved by C is delivered in the
corresponding NOTIFY.
</t>
<t>
Similarly, if the call was parked in an environment that does not
require 'orbit' parameters, subscribing to the URI used for parking the
call, i.e. &lt;sips:park-server@example.com&gt;, will still result in
the necessary information being provided for the call to be retrieved.

<section title="User Agent Considerations">
<t>
For Bob and Carol to be able to park and retrieve calls using a Park
Server, both need to be configured with the URI of the Park Server.  In
addition, Bob and Carol should be configured to understand whether or
not an orbit will be required for park and retrieve.  Finally, Bob also
needs to be configured to determine whether Bob should provide the orbit
or whether the orbit will be allocated by the Park Server.
</t>
<t>
Any orbit received from the Park Server, either in the Contact URI of a
302 or 2xx response to REFER, should be
rendered to the user in an appropriate manner, even if an orbit was
provided in the initial REFER. *** UNLESS it is the same as requested?
This is to allow Park Servers to
implement various policy decisions and allocate orbits as required.
Failure to do this may lead to a call being parked on a different orbit
to the expected one, and hence being effectively lost.
</t>
<t>
If the UA provided an orbit in the REFER request, and no orbit is
received from the Park Server, then the UA may assume that the call has
been parked against the requested orbit correctly.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Park Server Considerations">
<t>
It is expected that Park Servers will not necessarily support all the
feature variations described in this document, at least not
simultaneously.  Therefore Park Servers should offer the set that is
most appropriate for the target environment.  For example, some Park
Servers may offer centrally allocated orbits, some may not, and some may
be configurable.  Other policy-related decisions include how to handle
more than one call being parked on a particular orbit. *** FIXME more!

<section title="IANA Considerations">
<t>Open issue: presumably need to define the new uri-parameter 'orbit'.</t>
<t>According to <xref target="RFC3969" />, defining a URI parameter can
only be done in a standards-track RFC.  That doesn't sound like the sort
of thing this document will do, nor the sort of thing BLISS will do
either.  However, <xref target="RFC4240" /> ('netann') defines values
that are included in the current registry, and it is most definately
'Informational'.</t>
