		<t> 
The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT)
stresses the global routing system in a number of ways.  One of the
most costly stresses is FIB size:  ISPs often must upgrade router hardware
simply because the FIB has run out of space, and router vendors must
design routers that have adequate FIB.
FIB suppression is an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by
NOT loading selected RIB entries into the FIB.
This document specifies two styles of FIB suppression.  Edge suppression
(ES) allows ISPs that deploy a core-edge topology to shrink the FIBs of their
edge routers, including those that interface to other ISPs and exchange
the full DFRT.
Virtual Aggregation (VA) allows ISPs to shrink the FIBs of any and all
routers.
Both styles may be
deployed autonomously by an ISP (cooperation between ISPs is not required),
and can co-exist with legacy routers in the ISP.
</t>
        </abstract>

    <middle>

        <section title="Introduction">

		<t> 
ISPs today manage constant DFRT growth in a number of ways.
Most commonly, ISPs will upgrade their router hardware before DFRT growth
outstrips the size of the FIB.  In cases where an ISP wants to continue
to use routers whose FIBs are not large enough, it may deploy them at
edge locations where a full DFRT is not needed, for instance
at the customer interface.  Packets for which there is no route are
defaulted to a "core" infrastructure that does contain the full DFRT.
While this helps, it cannot be used for all edge routers, for
instance those that interface with other ISPs.  Alternatively, some
lower-tier ISPs may simply ignore some routes, for instance /24's that 
fall within the aggregate of another route.
</t>
<t>
FIB Suppression is an approach to shrinking FIB size that requires no
changes to BGP, no changes to packet forwarding mechanisms in routers,
and relatively minor changes to control mechanisms in routers and
configuration of those mechanisms.
The core idea behind FIB suppression is to run BGP as normal, and in
particular to not shrink the RIB, but rather to not load certain RIB
entries into the FIB, for instance by not committing them to the
Routing Table.  This approach minimizes changes to routers, and
in particular is simpler than more general routing architectures that
try to shrink both RIB and FIB.
With FIB suppression, there are no changes to BGP per se.  The
BGP decision process does not change.  
The selected AS-path does not change, and except on rare occasion the exit
router does not change.
ISPs can deploy FIB suppression autonomously and with no coordination with
neighbor ASes.
</t>
<t>
This document describes two styles of FIB suppression, "Edge Suppression"
(ES) and "Virtual Aggregation" (VA). 
ES can be used in ISPs that deploy
a "core-edge" topology, where edge routers can default route to core
routers.  In fact, this basic approach is in use today with edge routers
whose external peers do not require the full DFRT, for instance stub
networks.  ES extends this to edge routers whose external peers
do require the full DFRT, including neighbor ISPs and many multi-homed
stub networks.
ES requires that core routers load the full DFRT into FIBs (i.e. do no
FIB suppression).
ES operates by tunneling MPLS packets from the core, through edge routers,
to external peers (although edge routers strip the MPLS header before
forwarding packets to external peers).
ES works with legacy core routers, although they must be capable of
using MPLS tunnels.
ES also works with any mix of legacy and
upgraded edge routers.
ES imposes minimal new configuration requirements on network operators.
</t>
<t>
By contrast, Virtual Aggregation (VA) allows for FIB suppression in
any and all routers within an ISP.
The savings can be dramatic, easily
5x or 10x with only a slight path length and router load increase
<xref target="va-tech-report-08"></xref>.  
VA operates by organizing the IP (v4 or v6)
address space into Virtual Prefixes (VP), and using tunnels to
aggregate the (regular) sub-prefixes within each VP.
</t>

<section anchor="sec-scope" title="Scope of this Document">
<t>
The scope of this document is limited to Intra-domain ES and VA operation.
In other words, the case where a single ISP autonomously operates ES or VA
internally without any coordination with neighboring ISPs.  
</t>
<t>
Note that this document assumes that the ES or VA "domain"
(i.e. the unit of autonomy) is the AS (that is,
different ASes run VA independently and without coordination).
For the remainder of this document, the terms ISP, AS, and domain are
used interchangeably.
</t>
<t>
This document applies equally to IPv4 and IPv6.
</t>
<t>
ES or VA may operate with a mix of upgraded routers and
legacy routers.
There are no topological restrictions placed on the mix of routers.
In order to avoid loops between upgraded and legacy routers, however, any
legacy routers that require a full FIB
MUST participate in tunnel formation (MPLS).
</t>
<t>
ES and VA use tunnels.  While in principle a variety of tunnels
may be used---any tunnel that works for deploying a VPN---this
document limits itself to the use of MPLS tunnels,
and indeed the terms "tunnel" and "LSP" (Label Switched Path) are
used somewhat interchangeably.
This document also generally assumes the use of the Label
Distribution Protocol (LDP) as the default
method of establishing LSPs
<xref target="RFC5036"></xref>.
Other methods of establishing LSPs may be used.
Future versions of this document may specify the use of other tunnel
types.

<t hangText="Install and Suppress:"> 
	The terms "install" and "suppress" are used to describe whether
	a RIB entry has been loaded or not loaded into the FIB (or, equivalently,
	the Routing Table).  In other words, the phrase
	"install a route" means "install a route into the FIB", and the
	phrase "suppress a route" means "do not install a route into the
	FIB". 
</t>
<t hangText="Legacy Router:"> 
	A router that does not run VA or ES, and has no knowledge of VA or ES.
	Legacy routers, however, must participate in tunneling (with the
	exception of edge routers in ES that do not carry the full DFRT).
</t>
<t hangText="Popular Prefix:"> 
	A popular prefix is a sub-prefix that is installed in a router
	in addition to the sub-prefixes it holds by virtue of being a
	Aggregation Point Router (in the case of VA), or in addition to
	the default route (in the case of ES).
	The popular prefix allows packets
	to follow the shortest path.  Note that different routers do not
	need to have the same set of popular prefixes.
</t>
<t hangText="Routing Table:"> 
	The term Routing Table is defined here the same way as in Section 3.2 of
	<xref target="RFC4271"></xref>:  "Routing information that the BGP
	speaker uses to forward packets (or to construct the forwarding table
	used for packet forwarding) is maintained in the Routing Table."  As such,
	FIB Suppression can be achieved by not installing a route into the Routing
	Table

<t hangText="Routing Information Base (RIB):"> 
	The term RIB is used rather sloppily in this document to refer either

	advertise the VP to other routers with BGP.  For each 
	sub-prefix within the VP, APRs have a Label Switched Path
	(LSP) from themselves to the
	external peer where packets for that prefix should be delivered.
	<!--
	The egress router strips the MPLS header before forwarding to the
	external peer.
	Note in particular that
	it is the label map at the egress router, and not a FIB entry, that

	VPs not under discussion).  In these cases, the term "APR" will
	be taken to mean "a VA router that is an APR for the given VP",
	and the term "non-APR" will be taken to mean "a VA router that is not
	an APR for the given VP".  The term non-APR router will not be used

<t hangText="Sub-Prefix:"> 
	A regular (physically aggregatable) prefix.  These are equivalent to the
	prefixes that would normally comprise the DFRT in the

<section anchor="basic-operation" title="Overview of Virtual Aggregation (VA)">
<t>
For descriptive simplicity, this section starts by describing VA
assuming that there are no legacy routers in the domain.
<xref target="router-mix"></xref> describes the additional functions
required by VA routers to accommodate legacy routers.
</t>
<t>
A key concept behind VA is to operate BGP as normal, and in particular
to populate the RIB with the full DFRT, but to suppress
many or most
prefixes from being loaded into the FIB.   By populating the RIB as normal,
we avoid any changes to BGP, and changes to router operation are
relatively minor.
The basic idea behind VA is quite simple.  
The address space is partitioned into large prefixes --- larger than
any aggregatable prefix in use today.  These prefixes are called
virtual prefixes (VP).  Different VPs do not need to be the same
size.  They may be a mix of \6, \7, \8 (for IPv4), and so on.  Each
ISP can independently select the size of its VPs.  
</t>
<t>
VPs are not themselves physically aggregatable.  VA makes the VPs aggregatable
through the use of tunnels, as follows.
Associated with each VP are one or more "Aggregation Point Routers" (APR).
An APR (for a given VP) is a router that installs routes for all
sub-prefixes (i.e. real physically aggregatable prefixes) within the VP.
By "install routes" here, we mean:
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>
The route for each of the sub-prefixes is loaded into the FIB, and
</t>
<t>
there is a tunnel from the APR to the external peer that is the
BGP NEXT_HOP for the route (though note that the tunnel header is stripped
before the packet reaches the external peer).
</t>
</list></t>
The APR originates a BGP route to the VP.
This route is distributed within the domain, but not outside the domain.
With this structure in place, a packet transiting the ISP goes from
the ingress router to the APR via a tunnel, and then from the APR to
the external peer through another tunnel.
</t>
	
<t>
Note that the AS-path is not effected at all by VA.  Furthermore,
the external peer
selected by the ISP is the same whether or not VA is operating.
This path may not follow the shortest path within the ISP (where shortest
path is defined here as the path that would have been taken if VA were
not operating), because the APR may not be on the shortest path between
the ingress and egress routers.
When this happens, the packet experiences additional latency and creates
extra load (by virtue of taking more hops than it otherwise would have).
</t>
<t>
VA can avoid traversing the APR for selected routes by installing
these routes in ingress routers.
In other words, even if an ingress router is not an APR for a given
sub-prefix,
it may install that sub-prefix into its FIB.
Packets in this case are tunneled directly from the ingress to the
egress.
These routes are called "Popular Prefixes", and are typically installed
for policy reasons (i.e. customer routes are always installed), or
for sub-prefixes that carry a high volume of traffic
(<xref target="spec-pop-pre"></xref>).
Different routers may
have different popular prefixes.  As such, an ISP may assign popular
prefixes per router, per POP, or uniformly across the ISP.
A given router may have zero popular prefixes, or the majority of its
FIB may consist of popular prefixes.
The effectiveness of
popular prefixes to reduce traffic load
relies on the fact that traffic volumes follow something
like a power-law distribution: i.e. that 90% of traffic is destined to
10% of the destinations.  Internet traffic measurement
studies over the years have consistently shown that traffic patterns follow
this distribution, though there is no guarantee that they always will.
</t>
<t>
Note that for routing to work properly, every packet must sooner or later
reach a router that has installed a sub-prefix route that matches the packet.
This would obviously be the case for a given sub-prefix if every router
has installed a route for that sub-prefix (which of course is the situation in
the absence of VA).  If this is not the case, then there must be at
least one Aggregation Point Router (APR) for the
sub-prefix's virtual prefix (VP).
Ideally, every POP contains at least two APRs
for every virtual prefix.  By having APRs in every POP, the latency
imposed by routing to the APR is minimal (the extra hop is within the POP).
By having more than one APR, there is a redundant APR should one fail.
In practice it is often not possible to have an APR for every VP in every
POP.  This is because some POPs may have only one or a few routers,
and therefore there may not have enough cumulative FIB space in the POP
to hold every sub-prefix.
Note that any router ("edge", "core", etc.) may be an APR.
</t>

<section anchor="router-mix" title="Mix of legacy and VA routers">
<t>
It is important that an ISP be able to operate with a mix of "VA
routers" (routers upgraded to operate VA as described in the document)
and "legacy routers".
This allows ISPs to deploy VA in an incremental fashion and to continue
to use routers that for whatever reason cannot be upgraded.
This document allows such a mix, and indeed places no topological
restrictions on that mix.
It does, however, require that legacy routers establish and use LSPs, so that
APRs can forward packets to them.
Specifically, when a legacy router is a border router, it must initiate
LSPs to itself for instance using LDP,
<xref target="RFC5036"></xref>, and must use its own address as the
BGP NEXT_HOP in routes received from external peers.
</t>
<t>
VA prevents the routing loops that might otherwise occur when VA
routers and legacy routers are mixed, as follows.
First of all, note that once a packet reaches a VA router (either
because the ingress router is a VA router, or because a legacy router
forwards the packet to a VA router), it will
follow tunnels all the way to the egress router
(<xref target="basic-operation"></xref>).  If the egress
router is a VA router, then the packet is forwarded via the LSP
mapping.
If the egress router is a legacy router, then it will forward the
packet to the appropriate external peer using its FIB entry.
</t>
<t>
If the ingress router is a legacy router, then it will forward
the packet to the BGP NEXT_HOP via the associated tunnel.
</t>
<t>
Note that even in the unexpected case that some ingress legacy router actually
does not use the tunnel but rather forwards the packet to the IGP-resolved
next hop, the packet will either work its way
towards the egress router, and will either progress through a series
of legacy routers (in which case the IGP prevents loops), or it will
eventually reach a VA router (after which it will exit the AS via tunnels
as described above).
</t>
</section> <!-- "router-mix" -->

<section anchor="tunnel-sum" title="Summary of Tunnels and Paths">
<t>
To summarize, the following tunnels are created:
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>
From all routers to all APRs (noting that most VA routers are  
likely to be APRs).
</t>
<t>
From all routers to all legacy border routers.
</t>
<t>
From all routers to all external peers that are neighbors of
VA border routers.
</t>
</list></t>
There are a number of possible paths that packets may take through an ISP,
summarized in the following diagram.
Here, "VA" is a VA router, "LR" is a legacy router,
the symbol "==>" represents a tunneled packet (through zero or more
LSRs), "-->" represents an
untunneled packet, and "(pop)" represents stripping the MPLS header.
(Note that the external peer may actually be a legacy router or a VA
router---it doesn't matter (and isn't known) to the ISP.)

The first and second paths represent the case where the ingress
router does not have a popular prefix for the destination, and must
tunnel the packet to an APR.
The third and fourth paths represent the case where the ingress
router does have a popular prefix for the destination, and so tunnels
the packet directly to the egress.
The fifth and sixth paths are similar, but where the ingress is a
legacy router, and effectively has the popular prefix by virtue of
holding the entire DFRT.
(Note that some ISPs have only partial RIBs in their
customer-facing edge routers, and default route to a router that
holds the full DFRT.  This case is not shown here.)
Finally, paths 7 and 8 represent the unexpected case where legacy
routers do not use an IGP-resolved next hop rather than a tunnel.

<section anchor="sec-es-spec" title="Specification of Edge Suppression (ES)">
<t>
Edge Suppression can be thought of as VA with only a single VP (i.e. the /0).
Its operation, however, is much simpler.
The topology for ES consists of core routers and ES routers.
Core routers MUST install (into the FIB)
the full DFRT, and MUST participate in tunnels as described
below.  Any legacy router with tunneling capability and a large enough
FIB can be a core router.
</t>
<t>
ES routers are deployed at the edge.  They MUST have a default route
to (or towards) a core router, which MUST be installed.
This style of configuration is common today, and so it is not
necessary to specify here how the default route is configured and
managed.
The default route is the only route that ES routers must install,
although they may (and typically will) install additional routes.
Note that core routers or route reflectors that iBGP peer with an ES router
may choose to filter routes they send to the ES router, with the
obvious result that the ES router RIB will not contain the full DFRT.
This can only
be done if the ES router's external peers do not require the full
DFRT.  Whether or not an ISP chooses to do this is
orthogonal to the operation of ES per se, and is not mentioned again.
</t>
<t>
ES routers initiate MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSP, or tunnel) that terminate at each
of their external peers, which are then used by other routers to forward
packets to their external peers.
Specifically, ES routers MUST do the following:
	<t><list style="numbers">
<t>
They MUST initiate LSPs terminated at their external peers.
Specifically, they initiate Downstream Unsolicited tunnels to all IGP neighbors
for instance using LDP <xref target="RFC5036"></xref>, with the full address
of their external peers (/32 for IPv4, /128 for IPv6) as the FEC.
The effect of this is that the ES border routers use the received label to
know to which external peer to forward an outgoing packet (i.e. without
having to do a FIB lookup), but will strip the MPLS header before
forwarding to the external peer.
</t>
<t>
They MUST import the full address of the external peer into the IGP
(i.e. OSPF <xref target="RFC2328"></xref>).
This is of course necessary for LDP to establish the tunnels targeted to
the external peers.
</t>
<t>
When forwarding externally-received routes over iBGP, the
BGP NEXT_HOP attribute
MUST be set to the external peer (i.e. the FEC of the corresponding LSP).
</t>
</list></t>
</t>
<t>
It is important that if any router has a tunnel to the
BGP NEXT_HOP of a route, that it use that tunnel.
This should be normal behavior for any router, but ISPs must take
care to insure that this is the case.
</t>
<t>
Sometimes an ES router may receive a packet from one external peer that
needs to be forwarded to another of its external peers.
If the only route in the FIB is the default route, then the packet will
be routed to a core router, which will forward the packet back to the ES
router via a tunnel.  The extra hops can be avoided if the ES router
installs additional prefixes into the FIB, but under certain constraints to
prevent loops.  Specifically, the router SHOULD install any routes where
the IGP next hop router is not the same router as that of the default route, but
only under the following conditions:
<t><list style="symbols">
<t>
If the IGP next hop router is NOT an external peer, then the router MUST
use the tunnel to the BGP NEXT_HOP to forward the packet.  If the router
does not have such a tunnel, then it MUST NOT install the route.
</t>
<t>
If the IGP next hop router IS an external peer, then the route is
installed without using a tunnel.
</t>
</list></t>
These conditions prevent the loop that would form whereby 1) ES router R1
uses ES router R2 as a default route towards a core router, 2) ES
router R2 installs a route where the IGP next hop is ES router R1, and 3)
ES router R1 does not install that route.
</t>
<t>
New configuration requirements for Edge Suppression (i.e. in addition to
the configuration required today to deploy a core-edge topology with default
routes at the edge) are minimal.
The administrator must tell the ES router that it is an ES router, and
must indicate the default route (including backup defaults).
Given this, the ES router can automatically establish the appropriate
tunnels, install the default route and the additional routes, and suppress
all other routes.

While the core requirement is of course to be able to manage FIB
size, this must be done in a way that:

</t>


<section anchor="spec-legacy" title="Legacy Routers">
<t>
VA can operate with a mix of VA and legacy routers.  Although
legacy routers have no notion of VA, they nevertheless
MUST satisfy the following requirements:
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>
Each legacy router MUST initiate LSPs to itself.
Specifically, it initiates Downstream Unsolicited tunnels to all IGP neighbors
for instance using LDP <xref target="RFC5036"></xref>, with its own full address
(/32 if IPv4, /128 if IPv6) as the Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC).
</t>
<t>
When forwarding externally-received routes over iBGP, the
BGP NEXT_HOP attribute
MUST be set to the legacy router itself (the FEC of the corresponding LSP).

Legacy routers MUST participate fully in LDP.  In other words, they
MUST have all tunnels listed in <xref target="tunnel-sum"></xref>.
</t>

As long as legacy routers install LSPs as described here,
there are no topological restrictions on the legacy routers.  They
may be freely mixed with VA routers without the possibility of
forming sustained loops (<xref target="router-mix"></xref>).

<section anchor="spec-VPs" title="Advertising and Handling Virtual Prefixes (VP)">

<section anchor="sec-know-vp" title="Distinguishing VP's from Sub-prefixes">
<t>
VA routers must be able to distinguish VP's from sub-prefixes.
This is primarily in order to know which routes to install.
In particular, non-APR routers must know which prefixes are VPs before
they receive routes for those VPs, for instance when they first boot
up.
This is in order to avoid the situation where they unnecessarily start
filling their FIB with routes that they ultimately don't need to 
install (<xref target="spec-suppress"></xref>).
</t>
<t>
It MUST be possible to statically configure the complete list of
VP's into all VA routers.
This list is known as the VP-List.
</t>
</section> <!-- "sec-know-vp" -->


<section anchor="limit-vp" title="Limitations on Virtual Prefixes">
<t>
From the point of view of best-match routing semantics,
VPs are treated identically to any other prefix.  
In other words, if the longest matching prefix is a VP, then the packet
is routed towards the VP.
If a packet matching a VP reaches an Aggregation Point Router (APR)
for that VP, and the APR does not have a better matching route, then the packet
is discarded by the APR (just as a router that originates any prefix
will discard a packet that does not have a better match).
</t>
<t>
The overall semantics of VPs, however, are subtly different from those
of real prefixes (well, maybe not so subtly). 
Without VA, when a router originates a route for a (real)
prefix, the expectation is that the addresses within the prefix are
within the originating AS (or a customer of the AS).
For VPs, this is not the case.   APRs originate VPs whose sub-prefixes
exist in different ASes.
Because of this, it is important that VPs not be advertised across
AS boundaries.
</t>
<t>
It is up to individual domains to define their own VPs.
VPs MUST be "larger" (span a larger address space) than any real sub-prefix.
If a VP is smaller than a real prefix, then packets that match the real
prefix will nevertheless
be routed to an APR owning the VP, at which point the packet
will be dropped if it does not match a sub-prefix within the VP
(<xref target="sec-consider"></xref>).
</t>
<t>
(Note that, in principle there are cases where a VP could be smaller
than a real prefix.  There is where the egress router to the real
prefix is a VA router.  In this case, the APR could theoretically
tunnel the packet to the appropriate external peer, which would then
forward the packet correctly.  On the other hand, if the egress router
is a legacy router, then the APR could not tunnel
matching packets to the egress.
This is because the egress would view the VP as a better
match, and would loop the packet back to the APR.  For this reason
we require that VPs be larger than any real prefixes, and that
APR's never install prefixes larger than a VP in their FIBs.)
</t>
<t>
It is valid for a VP to be a subset of another VP.  For example,
20/7 and 20/8 can both be VPs.  In fact, this capability is necessary
for "splitting" a VP without increasing the FIB size in any router.
(<xref target="spec-VP-manage"></xref>).
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="spec-apr" title="Aggregation Point Routers (APR)">
<t>
Any router may be configured as an Aggregation Point Router
(APR) for one or more Virtual Prefixes (VP).  
For each VP for which a router is an APR, the router does
the following:
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>
The APR MUST originate a BGP route to the VP <xref target="RFC4271"></xref>.
In this route, the NLRI are all of the VPs
for which the router is an APR.
This is true even for VPs that are a subset of another VP.
The ORIGIN is set to INCOMPLETE (value 2), the AS number of the
APR's AS is used in the AS_PATH, and the BGP NEXT_HOP is set to the address
of the APR.  The ATOMIC_AGGREGATE and AGGREGATOR attributes are not
included.
</t>
<t>
The APR must attach a NO_EXPORT Communities Attribute 
<xref target="RFC1997"></xref> to the route.
</t>
<t>
The APR MUST initiate LSPs terminating at itself.
Specifically, it initiates Downstream Unsolicited tunnels to all IGP neighbors
for instance using LDP <xref target="RFC5036"></xref>, with the address that it
used in the BGP NEXT_HOP attribute of the VP route as the FEC.
Note that VA routers and legacy routers alike MUST have tunnels to
the APR.
</t>
<t>
If a packet is received at the APR whose best match is the VP (i.e.
it matches the VP but not any sub-prefixes within the VP), then the
packet MUST be discarded (see <xref target="limit-vp"></xref>).
This can be accomplished by never installing a prefix larger than the VP into
the FIB, or by installing the VP as a route to \dev\null.
</t>
</list></t>
</t>

<section anchor="spec-apr-select" title="Selecting APRs">
<t>
An ISP is free to select APRs however it chooses.  The details of this
are outside the scope of this document.
Nevertheless, a few comments are made here.
In general, APRs should be selected such that the distance to
the nearest APR for any VP is small---ideally within the same POP.
Depending on the number of routers in a POP, and the sizes of the FIBs
in the routers relative to the DFRT size, it may not be
possible for all VPs to be represented in a given POP.
In addition, there should be multiple APRs for each VP, again ideally
in each POP, so that the failure of one does not unduly disrupt traffic.
</t>
<t>
APRs may be (and probably should be) statically assigned.  
They may also, however, be dynamically assigned, for instance in
response to APR failure.  For instance, each router may be
assigned as a backup APR for some other APR.  If the other
APR crashes (as indicated by the withdrawal of its routes to its
VPs), the backup APR can install the appropriate sub-prefixes and
advertise the VP as specified above.
Note that doing so may require it to first remove some popular
prefixes from its FIB to make room.
</t>
<t>
Note that, although VPs MUST be larger than real prefixes, there
is intentionally no mechanism designed to automatically insure that
this is the case.  
Such a mechanisms would be dangerous.  For instance, if an ISP somewhere
advertised a very large prefix (a /4, say), then this would cause APRs
to throw out all VPs that are smaller than this.
For this reason, VPs must be set through static configuration only.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="spec-other-routers" title="Non-APR Routers">
<t>
A non-APR router MUST install at least the following routes:
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>
Routes to VPs (identifiable using the VP-List).
</t>
<t>
Routes to the largest of any prefixes that contain a given VP.
(Note that although this is not supposed to happen, if it does the non-APR should install
it, with the effect that any addresses in the prefix not covered by VPs
will be routed outside the domain.)
</t>
<t>
Routes to all prefixes that contain an address
that is in part of the address space for which no VP is defined (i.e. as
is done today without VP).
</t>
</list></t>
</t>
<t>
If the non-APR has a tunnel to the BGP NEXT_HOP of any such route, it
MUST use the tunnel to forward packets to the BGP NEXT_HOP.
</t>
<t>
When an APR fails, routers MUST select another APR to send packets to (if
there is one).
This happens, however, through normal internal BGP convergence mechanisms.
Note that it is strongly recommended that routers keep
at least two VP routes in their RIB at all times.
The main reason is that if the currently used VP route is withdrawn,
the second VP route can be immediately installed, and the issue of
whether to temporarily install sub-prefixes in the FIB is avoided
(<xref target="spec-suppress"></xref>).
Another reason is that the IGP can be used to even more quickly detect that
the APR has crashed, again allowing the second VP route to be
immediately installed.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="spec-VP-manage" title="Adding and deleting VP's">
<t>
An ISP may from time to time wish to reconfigure its VP-List.
There are a number of reasons.  For instance, early in its deployment
an ISP may configure one or a small number of VPs in order to test
VA.  As the ISP gets more confident with VA, it may increase the number
of VPs.  Or, an ISP may start with a small number of large VPs (i.e.
/4's), and over time move to more smaller VPs in order to save even
more FIB.  In this case, the ISP will need to "split" a VP.  Finally,
since the address space is not uniformly populated with prefixes, the
ISP may want to change the size of VPs in order to balance FIB size
across routers.  This can involve both splitting and merging VPs.
Of course, an ISP MUST be able to modify its VP-List without
1) interrupting service to any destinations, or 2) temporarily
increasing the size of any FIB (i.e. where the FIB size during the change
is no bigger than its size either before or after the change).
</t>
<t>
Adding a VP is straightforward.  The first step is to configure the APRs
for the VP.  This causes the APRs to originate routes for the VP.
Non-APR routers will install this route according to the rules in
<xref target="spec-other-routers"></xref>.
even though they do not yet recognize that the prefix is a VP.
Subsequently the VP is added to the VP-List of non-APR routers.
The Non-APR routers can then start suppressing the sub-prefixes with
no loss of service.
</t>
<t>
To delete a VP, the process is reversed.  First, the VP is removed
from the VP-Lists of non-APRs.  This causes the non-APRs to install
the sub-prefixes.  After all sub-prefixes have been installed, the
VP may be removed from the APRs.
</t>
<t>
In many cases, it is desirable to split a VP.  For instance, consider
the case where two routers, R1 and R2, are APRs for the same prefix.
It would be possible to shrink the FIB in both routers by splitting
the VP into two VPs (i.e. split one /6 into two /7's), and assigning
each router to one of the VPs.
While this could in theory be done by first deleting the larger VP,
and then adding the smaller VPs,
doing so would temporarily increase the FIB size in non-APRs,
which may not have adequate space for such an increase.
For this reason, we allow overlapping VPs.
</t>
<t>
To split a VP, first the two smaller VPs are added to the
VP-lists of all non-APR routers (in addition to the larger superset VP).
Next, the smaller VPs are added to the selected APRs (which may or may
not be APRs for the larger VP).
Because the smaller VPs are a better match than the larger VP,
this will cause the non-APR routers to forward packets to the
APRs for the smaller VPs.
Next, the larger VP can be removed from the VP-lists of all non-APR
routers.
Finally, the larger VP can be removed from its APRs.
</t>
<t>
Finally, to merge two VPs, the new larger VP is configured in all
non-APRs.  This has no effect on FIB size or APR selection, since the
smaller VPs are better matches.  Next the larger VP is configured in its
selected APRs.  
Next the smaller VPs are deleted from all non-APRs.
Finally, the smaller VPs are deleted from their corresponding APRs.

<section anchor="spec-br" title="Border VA Routers">
<t>
VA routers that are border routers MUST do the following:
	<t><list style="numbers">
<t>
They MUST initiate LSPs to their external peers.
Specifically, they initiate Downstream Unsolicited tunnels to all IGP neighbors
for instance using LDP <xref target="RFC5036"></xref>, with the full address
of their external peers (/32 for IPv4, /128 for IPv6) as the FEC.
The effect of this is that the VA borders use the received label to
know to which external peer to forward an outgoing packet (i.e. without
having to do a FIB lookup), but will strip the MPLS header before
forwarding to the external peer.
</t>
<t>
They MUST import the full address of the external peer into the IGP
(i.e. OSPF <xref target="RFC2328"></xref>).
This is of course necessary for LDP to establish the tunnels targeted to
the external peers.
</t>
<t>
When forwarding externally-received routes over iBGP, the
BGP NEXT_HOP attribute
MUST be set to the external peer (i.e. the FEC of the corresponding LSP).
</t>
</list></t>
</t>
<t>
(Note that an alternative approach would be to used stacked labels,
with the outer label terminating at the border router, and the inner
label identifying the external peer and distributed in BGP as described in
<xref target="RFC3107"></xref>.  This approach requires that fewer
tunnels be installed by LDP.  The need for this approach is for
further study.)
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="spec-sub-prefix" title="Advertising and Handling Sub-Prefixes">
<t>
Sub-prefixes are advertised and handled by BGP
as normal.  VA does not effect this behavior.  The only difference in the
handling of sub-prefixes is that they might not be installed in the FIB,
as described in <xref target="spec-suppress"></xref>.
</t>
<t>
In those cases where the route is installed, packets forwarded
to prefixes external to the AS MUST be transmitted via the LSP
established as described in 
<xref target="spec-br"></xref>.
</t>
</section>


<section anchor="spec-suppress" title="Suppressing FIB Sub-prefix Routes">
<t>
Any route not for a known VP (i.e. not in the VP-List)
is taken to be a sub-prefix.
The following rules are used to determine if a sub-prefix route can
be suppressed.
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>
If the router is an APR, a route for every sub-prefix
within the VP MUST be installed.
</t>
<t>
If a non-APR router has a sub-prefix route that does not fall within any VP
(as determined by the VP-List), then the route must be installed.
This may occur because the ISP hasn't defined a VP covering that prefix,
for instance during an incremental deployment buildup.
</t>
<t>
If a non-APR router does not have a route for a known VP, then it MAY
or MAY NOT install sub-prefixes within that VP.
Whether or not it does is up to the vendor and the network operator.  One
approach is to never install such sub-prefixes, on the assumption that
the network operator will engineer his network so that this rarely if
ever happens.
</t>
<t>
Another approach is to have routers install such sub-prefixes, but taking
care not to do so if the missing VP route is a transient condition.
For instance, if the router is booting up, and simply has not yet received
all of its routes, then it can reasonably expect to receive a VP route soon and
so SHOULD NOT install the sub-prefixes.
On the other hand, if a continuously
operating router had only a single remaining route
for the VP, and
that route is withdrawn, then the router might not
expect to receive a replacement
VP route soon and so SHOULD install the sub-prefixes.
Obviously a router can't predict the future with certainty, so the
following algorithm might be a useful way to manage whether or not to
install sub-prefixes for a non-existing VP route:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
Define a timer MISSING_VP_TIMER, set for a relatively short time
(say 10 seconds or so).
</t>
<t>
Start the timer when either: 1) the last VP route is withdrawn, or
2) there are initially neither VP routes nor sub-prefix routes, and
the first sub-prefix route is received.
</t>
<t>
When the timer expires, install sub-prefix routes.  Note, however,
that optional routes may first need to be removed from the FIB to make 
room for the new sub-prefix routes.  If even after removing optional
routes there is no room in the FIB for sub-prefix routes, then
they should remain suppressed.  In other words, sub-prefix
entries required by
virtue of being an APR take priority over sub-prefix entries
required by virtue of not having a VP route.
</t>
</list></t>
Note that non-APR routers may wish to start installing sub-prefixes
after the second-to-last route is withdrawn.  This avoids a temporary
loss of connectivity to those sub-prefixes in case the final VP route
is withdrawn.
<t>
All other sub-prefix routes MAY be suppressed.  Such "optional"
sub-prefixes that are nevertheless installed are
referred to as popular prefixes.
</t>
</list></t>
</t>

<section anchor="spec-pop-pre" title="Selecting Popular Prefixes">
<t>
Individual routers may independently choose
which sub-prefixes are popular prefixes.
There is no need for different routers to install the same sub-prefixes.
There is therefore significant leeway as to how routers select popular
prefixes.
As a general rule, routers should fill the FIB as much as possible, because
the cost of doing so is relatively small, and more FIB entries leads to
fewer packets taking a longer path.
Broadly speaking,
an ISP may choose to fill the FIB by making routers APR's for as many VP's
as possible, or by assigning relatively few APR's and rather filling the
FIB with popular prefixes.
Several basic approaches to selecting popular prefixes are outlined here.
Router vendors are free to implement whatever approaches they want.
</t>
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>
Policy-based:  The simplest approach for network administrators is to have
broad policies that routers use to
determine which sub-prefixes are designated as popular.
An obvious policy would be a "customer routes" policy, whereby all
customer routes are installed (as identified for instance by 
community attribute tags).
Another policy would be for a router to install prefixes originated
by specific ASes.  For instance, two ISPs could mutually agree to
install each other's originated prefixes.
A third policy might be to install prefixes with the shortest AS-path.
</t>
<t>
Static list:  Another approach would be to configure static lists of
specific prefixes to install.  For instance, prefixes associated with
an SLA might be configured.  Or, a list of prefixes for the most popular
websites might be installed.
</t>
<t>
High-volume prefixes: By installing high-volume prefixes as popular prefixes,
the latency and load associated with the longer path required by VA
is minimized.
One approach would be for an ISP to measure its traffic volume over
time (days or a few weeks), and statically configure high-volume prefixes
as popular prefixes.
There is strong evidence that prefixes that are high-volume tend to
remain high-volume over multi-day or multi-week timeframes (though not
necessarily at short timeframes like minutes or seconds).
High-volume prefixes may also be installed dynamically.  In other words,
a router measures its own traffic volumes, and installs and removes
popular prefixes in response to short term traffic load.
The downside of this approach is that it complicates debugging network
problems.  If packets are being dropped somewhere in the network, it
is more difficult to find out where if the selected path can change
dynamically.

<xref target="va-requirements"></xref>.
</t>

<section anchor="router-failure" title="Response to router failure">
<t>
VA introduces a new failure mode
in the form of Aggregation Point Router (APR) failure.  
There are two basic approaches to protecting against APR failure,
static APR redundancy, and dynamic APR assignment (see 
<xref target="spec-apr-select"></xref>).
In static APR redundancy, enough APRs are assigned for each Virtual
Prefix (VP) so that if one goes down, there are others to absorb
its load.  
Failover to a static redundant APR is automatic with existing BGP
mechanisms.  
If an APR crashes, BGP will cause packets to be routed to the next
nearest APR.  Nevertheless, there are three concerns here: convergence
time, load increase at the redundant APR, and latency increase for
diverted flows.
</t>
<t>
Regarding convergence time,
note that, while fast-reroute mechanisms apply to the rerouting of
packets to a given APR or egress router, they don't apply to
APR failure.
Convergence time was discussed in 
<xref target="spec-other-routers"></xref>, which suggested that
it is likely that BGP convergence times will be
adequate, and if not the IGP mechanisms may be used.
</t>
<t>
Regarding load increase, in general this is relatively small.
This is because
substantial reductions in FIB size can be achieved with almost
negligible increase in load.  For instance,
<xref target="va-tech-report-08"></xref> shows that a 5x reduction in
FIB size yields a less than one percent increase in load overall.
Given this, depending on the configuration of redundant APRs, failure
of one APR increases the load of its backups by only a few percent.
This is well within the variation seen in normal traffic loads.
</t>
<t>
Regarding latency increase, some flows may see a significant
increase in delay (and, specifically, an increase that puts it outside
of its SLA boundary).  Normally a redundant APR would be placed within
the same POP, and so increased latency would be minimal (assuming that
load is also quite small, and so there is no significant queuing delay).
It is not always possible, however, to have an APR for every VP within
every POP, much less a redundant APR within every POP, and so sometimes
failure of an APR will result in significant
latency increases for a small fraction of traffic.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="req-TE" title="Traffic Engineering">
<t>
VA complicates traffic engineering because the placement of APRs and
selection of popular prefixes influences how packets flow.
(Though to repeat, increased load is in any event likely to be minimal,
and so the effect on traffic engineering should not be great in any
event.)
Since the majority of packets may be forwarded by popular prefixes (and
therefore follow the shortest path), it is
particularly important that popular prefixes be selected appropriately.
As discussed in <xref target="spec-pop-pre"></xref>, there
are static and dynamic approaches to this.
<xref target="va-tech-report-08"></xref> shows that high-volume prefixes
tend to stay high-volume for many days, and so a static strategy
is probably adequate.
VA can operate correctly using either RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC3209"></xref>
or LDP to establish tunnels.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="req-inc" title="Incremental and safe deploy and start-up">
<t>
It must be possible to install and configure VA in a safe and
incremental fashion, as well as start it up when routers reboot.
This document allows for a mixture of VA and legacy routers, 
allows a fraction or all of the address space to fall within
virtual prefixes,
and allows different routers to suppress different FIB entries (including
none at all).
As a result, it is generally possible to deploy and test VA in an
incremental fashion.
Although MPLS and LDP must be operational everywhere, once done, an
ISP can incrementally increase the number of VA routers, the number
of VPs, and the number of suppressed FIB entries over time.
</t>
<t>
Likewise, routers can bootstrap VA by first bringing up the IGP, then
establish LSPs, then establish routes to all required sub-prefixes,
and then finally advertise VPs.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="req-sec" title="VA security">
<t>
Regarding ingress filtering, because in VA the RIB is effectively
unchanged, routers contain the same information they have today
for installing ingress filters <xref target="RFC2827"></xref>.
Presumably, installing an ingress filter in the FIB takes up some
memory space.  Since ingress filtering is most effective at the
"edge" of the network (i.e. at the customer interface), the number
of FIB entries for ingress filtering should remain relatively
small---equal to the number of prefixes owned by the customer.
Whether this is true in all cases remains for further study.
</t>
<t>
Regarding DoS attacks, there are two issues that need to be considered.
First, does VA result in new types of DoS attacks?  Second, does VA
make it more difficult to deploy DoS defense systems.
Regarding the first issue, 
one possibility is that an attacker targets a given
router by flooding the network with traffic to prefixes that are not
popular, and for which that router is an APR.  This would cause a
disproportionate amount of traffic to be forwarded to the APR(s).
While it is up to individual ISPs to decide if this attack is a concern,
it does not strike the authors that this attack is likely
to significantly worsen the DoS problem.
</t>
<t>
Regarding DoS defense system deployment, more input about specific
systems is needed.  It is the authors' understanding,
however, that at least some of these
systems use dynamically established Routing Table entries to divert
victims' traffic into LSPs that carry the traffic to scrubbers.
The expectation is that this mechanism simply over-rides whatever
route is in place (with or without VA), and so the operation of VA
should not limit the deployment of these types of DoS defense systems.
Nevertheless, more study is needed here.
</t>

<section anchor="sec-new-config" title="New Configuration">
<t>
VA places new configuration requirements on ISP administrators.
Namely, the administrator must:
<t><list style="numbers">
<t>
Select VPs, and configure the VP-List into all VA routers.
As a general rule, having a larger number of relatively small prefixes
gives administrators the most flexibility in terms of filling
available FIB with sub-prefixes, and in terms of balancing load across
routers.  Once an administrator has selected a VP-List, it is just
as easy to configure routers with a large list as a small list.
We can expect network operator groups like NANOG to compile good
VP-Lists that ISPs can then adopt.  A good list would be one where
the number of VPs is relatively large, say 100 or so
(noting again that each VP must be smaller than
a real prefix), and the number of sub-prefixes within each VP is
roughly the same.
</t>
<t>
Select and configure APRs.
There are three primary considerations here.  First, there must be enough
APRs to handle reasonable APR failure scenarios.
Second, APR assignment should not result in router overload.
Third, particularly long paths should be avoided.
Ideally there should be two APRs for each VP within each PoP, but this
may not be possible for small PoPs.
Failing this, there should be at least two APRs in each geographical
region, so as to minimize path length increase.
Routers should have the appropriate counters to allow administrators to
know the volume of APR traffic each router is handling so as to adjust
load by adding or removing APR assignments.
</t>
<t>
Select and configure Popular Prefixes or Popular Prefix policies.
There are two general goals here.  The first is to minimize load overall
by minimizing the number of packets that take longer paths.
The second is to insure that specific selected prefixes don't have overly
long paths.
These goals must be weighed against the administrative overhead
of configuring potentially thousands of popular prefixes.
As one example a small ISP may wish to keep it simple by
doing nothing more than
indicating that customer routes should be installed.  In this case,
the administrator could otherwise assign as many APRs as possible
while leaving enough FIB space for customer routes.
As another example, a large ISP could build a management system that
takes into consideration the traffic matrix, customer SLAs,
robustness requirements, FIB sizes, topology, and router capacity,
and periodically automatically computes APR and
popular prefix assignments.

<section anchor="sec-iana" title="IANA Considerations">
<t>
There are no IANA considerations.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sec-consider" title="Security Considerations">
<t>
We consider the security implications of VA under two scenarios, one where
VA is configured and operated correctly, and one where it is mis-configured.
A cornerstone of VA operation is that the basic behavior of BGP doesn't
change, especially inter-domain.  Among other things, this makes it easier
to reason about security.
</t>

<section anchor="sec-good-con" title="Properly Configured VA">
<t>
If VA is configured and operated properly, then the
external behavior of an AS does not change.  The same upstream ASes are
selected, and the same prefixes and AS-paths are advertised.
Therefore, a properly configured VA domain has no security impact on other
domains.
</t>
<t>
This document discusses intra-domain security concerns in 
<xref target="req-sec"></xref>  which argues that any new security
concerns appear to be relatively minor.
</t>
<t>
If another ISP starts advertising a prefix that is larger than a given VP,
this prefix will be ignored by APRs that have a VP that falls within
the larger prefix (<xref target="spec-apr"></xref>).
As a result, packets that might otherwise have been routed to the new
larger prefix will be dropped at the APRs.
Note that the trend in the Internet is towards large prefixes being
broken up into smaller ones, not the reverse.
Therefore, such a larger prefix is likely to be invalid.  If it is
determined without a doubt that the larger prefix is valid, then the
ISP will have to reconfigure its VPs.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sec-miscon" title="Mis-configured VA">
<t>
VA introduces the possibility that a VP is advertised outside
of an AS.  This in fact should be a low probability event, but it is
considered here none-the-less.
</t>
<t>
If an AS leaks a large VP (i.e. larger than any real prefixes), then the
impact is minimal.  Smaller prefixes will be preferred because of best-match
semantics, and so the only impact is that packets that otherwise have no
matching routes will be sent to the misbehaving AS and dropped there.
If an AS leaks a small VP (i.e. smaller than a real prefix), then
packets to that AS will be hijacked by the misbehaving AS and dropped.
This can happen with or without VA, and so doesn't represent a new
security problem per se.
</t>

<t>The architecture for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is described in RFC 3031.  A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic between and through them.  This common understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called a label distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs another of label bindings it has made.  This document defines a set of such procedures called LDP (for Label Distribution Protocol) by which LSRs distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed paths.

  <abstract>
	  <t>This report describes how an ISP can reduce its FIB size, and in so doing delay the time at which the ISP must upgrade its routers. The approach, called Virtual Aggregation (VA) works with existing routers. An ISP can autonomously deploy VA ? it does not need to coordinate with its neighbor ISPs. While VA results in some increased load and path latency, the increase is minimal. VA can shrink FIB size by an order of magnitude or more with very little load and latency increase. While some ISPs are overflowing their FIBs today, we believe that even ISPs that are not yet in this situation may require VA in the near future. This is because FIB size may increase dramatically as IPv4 addresses expire and the address space becomes more fragmented, as well as because IPv6 usage may increase. A prepared ISP can absorb this increase using VA.
