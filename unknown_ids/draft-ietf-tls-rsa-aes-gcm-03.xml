			<t> This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES)
    in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as a Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    authenticated encryption operation.  GCM provides both confidentiality
    and data origin authentication, can be efficiently implemented in
    hardware for speeds of 10 gigabits per second and above, and is also
    well-suited to software implementations.  This memo defines TLS
    cipher suites that use AES-GCM with RSA, DSS and Diffie-Hellman based key exchange mechanisms.

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>This document describes the use of AES <xref target="AES" ></xref> in Galois Counter Mode (GCM) <xref target="GCM"></xref> (AES-GCM) with various key exchange mechanisms as a cipher suite for TLS.  AES-GCM is an authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) cipher (as defined in TLS 1.2 <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis"></xref>) providing both confidentiality and data origin authentication.  The following sections define cipher suites based on RSA, DSS and Diffie-Hellman key exchanges; ECC based cipher suites are defined in a separate document <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-ecc-new-mac"></xref>.  </t>

<t>AES-GCM is not only efficient and secure, but hardware implementations can achieve high speeds with low cost and low latency, because the mode can be pipelined. Applications that require high data throughput can benefit from these high-speed implementations. AES-GCM has been specified as a mode that can be used with IPsec ESP <xref target="RFC4106"></xref> and 802.1AE MAC Security <xref target="IEEE8021AE"></xref>.  </t>

					CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD}
				</t></list></t>
<t>These cipher suites use the AES-GCM authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) algorithms AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM described in <xref target="RFC5116"></xref>.  Note that each of these AEAD algorithms uses a 128-bit authentication tag with GCM. 

The "nonce" SHALL be 12 bytes long consisting of two parts as follows: (this is an example of a "partially explicit" nonce; see section 3.2.1 in <xref target="RFC5116"></xref>).  
</t>

<figure >
	<artwork  >
          struct{
             opaque salt[4];
             opaque nonce_explicit[8]; 	   
          } GCMNonce;</artwork>
</figure>

<t>    The salt is the "implicit" part of the nonce and is not sent in the packet.  Instead the salt is generated as part of the handshake process: it is either the client_write_IV (when the client is sending) or the server_write_IV (when the server is sending).   The salt length (SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length) is 4 octets.
</t>

<t>    The nonce_explicit is the "explicit" part of the nonce.  It is chosen by the sender and is carried in each TLS record in the GenericAEADCipher.nonce_explicit field. The nonce_explicit length (SecurityParameters.record_iv_length) is 8 octets. </t>


<t>Each value of the nonce_explicit MUST be distinct for each distinct invocation of GCM encrypt function for any fixed key.  Failure to meet this uniqueness
    requirement can significantly degrade security. The nonce_explicit MAY be the 64-bit sequence number.</t>

<t>The RSA, DHE_RSA, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DH_DSS, and DH_anon  key exchanges are performed as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis"></xref>.</t>
<t>The PRF algorithms SHALL be as follows:</t>
<list>
<t><vspace>1</vspace>For cipher suites ending with _SHA256, the PRF is the TLS PRF <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis"></xref> with SHA-256 as the hash function.</t> 
<t><vspace>1</vspace>For cipher suites ending with _SHA384, the PRF is the TLS PRF <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis"></xref> with SHA-384 as the hash function.</t></list>

<t>Implementations MUST send TLS Alert bad_record_mac for all types of failures encountered in processing the AES-GCM algorithm. </t>

		</section>
		<section title="TLS Versions">
			<t>These cipher suites make use of the authenticated encryption with additional data defined in TLS 1.2 <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis"></xref>.  They MUST NOT be negotiated in older versions of TLS.
   Clients MUST NOT offer these cipher suites if they do not offer TLS
   1.2 or later.  Servers which select an earlier version of TLS MUST
   NOT select one of these cipher suites.  Because TLS has no way for
   the client to indicate that it supports TLS 1.2 but not earlier, a
   non-compliant server might potentially negotiate TLS 1.1 or earlier
   and select one of the cipher suites in this document.  Clients MUST
   check the TLS version and generate a fatal "illegal_parameter" alert
   if they detect an incorrect version.</t>

<t> The security considerations in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis"></xref>  apply to this
   document as well.  The remainder of this section describes security
   considerations specific to the cipher suites described in this
   document.</t>

			<section title="Counter Reuse">
				<t>AES-GCM security requires that the counter is never reused.  The IV construction in <xref target="rsasuite"></xref> is designed to prevent counter reuse. </t>

<section title="Recommendations for Multiple Encryption Processors">

<t>If multiple cryptographic processors are in use by the sender, then
    the sender MUST ensure that, for a particular key, each value of the nonce_explicit used with that key is distinct.  In this case each
    encryption processor SHOULD include in the nonce_explicit
    a fixed value that is distinct for each processor.  The recommended
    format is</t>

<figure >
	<artwork  >
     nonce_explicit = FixedDistinct || Variable
         </artwork>
</figure>

<t>    where the FixedDistinct field is distinct for each encryption
    processor, but is fixed for a given processor, and the Variable
    field is distinct for each distinct nonce used by a particular
    encryption processor.  When this method is used, the FixedDistinct
    fields used by the different processors MUST have the same length.</t>

   <t> In the terms of Figure 2 in <xref target="RFC5116"></xref>, the Salt is the Fixed-Common
    part of the nonce (it is fixed, and it is common across all
    encryption processors), the FixedDistinct field exactly corresponds
    to the Fixed-Distinct field, and the Variable field corresponds to the Counter field, and the explicit part exactly corresponds to the nonce_explicit.</t>

<t> For clarity, we provide an example for TLS in which there are two distinct
    encryption processors, each of which uses a one-byte FixedDistinct
    field:</t>
<figure >
	<artwork  >
       Salt          = eedc68dc
       FixedDistinct = 01       (for the first encryption processor)
       FixedDistinct = 02       (for the second encryption processor)
</artwork>
</figure>

<t>    The GCMnonces generated by the first encryption processor, and their
    corresponding nonce_explicit, are:</t>
<figure >
	<artwork  >
       GCMNonce                    nonce_explicit
