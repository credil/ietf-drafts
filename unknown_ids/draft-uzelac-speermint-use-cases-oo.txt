Abstract 

   This document describes the typical interconnection scenarios for SIP 
   peering within varying contexts.  In all the scenarios, two or more 
   administrative domains have some pre-established agreement that 
   permits both signaling and media to traverse the network boundary.

1. Introduction 

   The intention of this document is to depict the current SIP Peering 
   scenarios of the VoIP Service Provider. (VSP) The use cases involve 
   VSPs as both a supplier of VoIP directly to end users, and within an 
   Inter-Exchange Carrier (IXC) context, meaning providing SIP 
   origination and termination services between VSPs. 

2. Terminology 

   o  VoIP Service Provider (VSP): - This term VoIP Service Provider is 
      consistent with SPEERMINT Terminology [12].  The individual types 
      of VSPs are defined below. 

   o  Originating VSP - VSP(o): A VSP where the calling party resides. 

   o  Terminating VSP - VSP(t): A VSP where he called party resides.

Internet-Draft     draft-uzelac-speermint-use-cases      September 2006 
    

   o  Transit VSP - VSP(T): A VSP which is responsible for transiting 
      sessions from one VSP to another VSP.  The Transit VSP is 
      typically not the registrar for the user. A Transit VSP can also 
      be an Access VSP. 

   o  Session Border Controller (SBC): A SIP Intermediary device 
      implemented as a B2BUA. [17] 

3. Assumptions 

   o  All call flows are implemented in a collapsed signaling and media 
      at the administrative boundary.  The media flows are symmetrical 
      across the boundary. 

   o  Transcoding, if required, is done at first point of recognized 
      media incompatibility. 

   o  There is assumed IP reachability between network elements within 
      administrative domain, as well as those network session border 
      elements that "straddle" boundaries of both administrative 
      domains. 

   o  There is no assumption of private (RFC1918) or public address 
      space being used. 

4. Background for Use Cases 

   In the VSP interconnection scenarios illustrated in this document, 
   the VoIP network border is "ring-fenced" with Session Border 
   Controllers. As noted in [17], there are many functions that a SBC 
   performs at the border of the VoIP network.   

   It is important to understand the trust boundaries of the 
   interconnection VSP administrative domains. Figure 1 shows the trust 
   boundaries between the different networks that exchange traffic.

   Figure 1 VSP Core Network 

   In the following use cases there are subtle, but significant 
   differences to the interconnection design.  Administrative domains 
   are interconnected by one or more Session Border Controllers (SBC) 
   that are Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUA).  The SBC facilitates, 
   among other functions, demarcation between the interconnected 
   administrative domains.  This is mostly done between VSPs, but there 
   are instances of multiple administrative domains within a single VSP. 
   The illustration of the MGW<->PSTN interconnect is noted as out of 
   scope for this document, but shown to as it's part of the "untrusted" 
   domain. 

   NOTE: The SBC performs anonymizing services where all identifying 
   information on Alice is removed. The anonymizing service is not 
   related to privacy for the calling or called party, rather topology 
   hiding and network abstraction. The SBC may also identify the need to 
   perform codec media conversion (transcoding), if required to complete 
   the call. 

5. Use Cases 

5.1. Proxy(o) to SBC(o) to Proxy(t) 

   In this type of interconnection scenario, the SBC is owned and 
   operated within the originating administrative domain.

     1. The proxy of origination performs some next-hop determination 
        for the called party.  This can be done via ENUM/DNS/Redirect 
        3XX multiple choices and/or static routing.  

     2. The result of the query will be a SBC that is directly 
        interconnected to the terminating domain.  

     3. Proxy will signal the SBC.   

     4. The SBC performs some next-hop determination for the called 
        party.  This can be done via ENUM/DNS/Redirect 3XX multiple 
        choices and/or static routing.  

     5. The result of this query is the Proxy server within VSP(t)'s 
        network. 

     6. SBC signals the proxy.

5.2. Proxy(o) to SBC(o) to SBC(t) to Proxy(t) 

   Multiple SBCs are implemented in this interconnection scenario.  The 
   SBCs are operated within different administrative domains.   

     1. The proxy within the originating domain performs some next-hop 
        determination for the called party.  This can be done via 
        ENUM/DNS/Redirect 3XX multiple choices and/or static routing.

     2. The next-hop would be one of possibly many SBCs that are 
        interconnected with the VSP(t).   

     3. Proxy signals SBC1.   

     4. The SBC1 performs some next-hop determination for the called 
        party.  This can be done via ENUM/DNS/Redirect 3XX multiple 
        choices and/or static routing. In this scenario, SBC1 queries 
        within the terminating network's administrative domain. 

     5. The result of this query is VSP(t)'s SBC.   

     6. SBC1 would them forward the signaling to the appropriate SBC 
        within VSP(t), in this case SBC2. 

     7. SBC2 performs some next-hop determination for the called party.  
        This can be done via ENUM/DNS/Redirect 3XX multiple choices 
        and/or static routing. 

     8. The result of this query is Proxy in VSP(t). 

     9. SBC2 signals Proxy

5.3. Proxy(o) to SBC(T) to SBC(T) to Proxy(t) 

   In this interconnection scenario, three VSPs are involved in the call 
   flow.  There is a VSP of origination referred to as VSP(o).  There is 
   also a terminating VSP, referred to as VSP(t).  In this use case, 
   VSP(o) does not have a direct interconnection, contractual agreement 
   or any way to directly send calls to VSP(t).  In this case a third 
   VSP provides transit services.  This VSP is referred to as VSP(T).  
   This method of communication is depicted in the figure below.

     1. The proxy within the originating domain performs some next-hop 
        determination for the called party. This can be done via 
        ENUM/DNS/Redirect 3XX multiple choices and/or static routing.   

     2. The next-hop would be one of possibly many SBCs that border with 
        VSP(T), but is owned and operated by VSP(o).  

     3. The proxy in VSP(o) signals SBC1 

     4. SBC1 performs some next-hop determination for the called party. 
        This can be done via ENUM/DNS/Redirect 3XX multiple choices 
        and/or static routing. This process occurs within VSP(T).  

     5. The result of this query would be SBC2 that is also under the 
        administrative responsibility of VSP(T).

     6. SBC1 signals SBC2. 

     7. Another separate next-hop route determination process will occur 
        within VSP(t). 

     8. The result is the terminating proxy. 

     9. SBC2 signals terminating proxy. 

5.4. Proxy(o) to SBC(o) to SBC(T) to SBC(T) to SBC(t) Proxy(t) 

   As in the interconnection scenario depicted in section 5.3. , three 
   VSPs are involved in the call flow.  The proxy within the originating 
   domain performs some next-hop determination for the called party. 
   This can be done via ENUM/DNS/Redirect 3XX multiple choices and/or 
   static routing.  The next-hop would be one of possibly many SBCs that 
   border with VSP(T), but is owned and operated by VSP(o).  The SBC 
   performs some next-hop determination for the called party. This can 
   be done via ENUM/DNS/Redirect 3XX multiple choices and/or static 
   routing.  The result of this query would be the SBC that is under the 
   administrative responsibility of VSP(T).  A distinctly separate next-
   hop route determination process will occur within VSP(T) that may 
   take into account some originating information, like VSP(o)'s SBC.  
   The initial SBC in VSP(T) performs a next-hop determination for the 
   called party. This can be done via ENUM/DNS/Redirect 3XX multiple 
   choices and/or static routing.  The result would be a second SBC 
   within VSP(T) that is interconnected to VSP(o).  This second SBC 
   performs some next-hop determination for the called party. This can 
   be done via ENUM/DNS/Redirect 3XX multiple choices and/or static 
   routing.  The result of this query would be one of possibly many SBCs 
   within the administrative responsibility of VSP(t).

6. Security Considerations 

 
This document introduces no new security considerations.  However, it    
is important to note that session interconnect, as described in this    
document, has a wide variety of security issues that should be    
considered in documents addressing both protocol and use case    
analyzes. 
 
 
7. IANA Considerations 

 
This document creates no new requirements on IANA namespaces    
[RFC2434].
