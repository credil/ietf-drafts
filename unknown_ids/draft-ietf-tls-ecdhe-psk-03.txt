Abstract 

   This document extends RFC 4279, RFC 4492 and RFC 4785, and specifies 
   a set of ciphersuites that use a pre-shared key (PSK) to authenticate 
   an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman exchange (ECDH).  These ciphersuites 
   provide Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).

Internet-Draft     ECDHE_PSK Cipher Suites for TLS       September 2008 
    

1. Introduction 

   RFC 4279 specifies cipher suites for supporting TLS using pre-shared 
   symmetric keys which (a) use only symmetric key operations for 
   authentication, (b) use a Diffie-Hellman exchange authenticated with 
   a pre-shared key, or (c) combine public key authentication of the 
   server with pre-shared key authentication of the client.  

   RFC 4785 specifies authentication-only cipher suites (with no 
   encryption).  These cipher suites are useful when authentication and 
   integrity protection is desired, but confidentiality is not needed or 
   not permitted. 

   RFC 4492 defines a set of ECC-based cipher suites for TLS and 
   describes the use of ECC certificates for client authentication.  In 
   particular, it specifies the use of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman 
   (ECDH) key agreement in a TLS handshake and the use of Elliptic Curve 
   Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) as a new authentication 
   mechanism. 

   This document specifies a set of cipher suites that use a PSK to 
   authenticate an ECDH exchange.  These cipher suites provide Perfect 
   Forward Secrecy.  One of these ciphersuites provides authentication-
   only. 

   The reader is expected to become familiar with RFC 4279, RFC 4492, 
   and RFC 4785 prior to studying this document. 

1.1. Applicability Statement 

   The ciphersuites defined in Sections 3.1 and 4.1 can be negotiated, 
   whatever the negotiated TLS version is. 

   The ciphersuites defined in Sections 3.2 and 4.2 can be negotiated in 
   TLS version 1.2 or higher. 

1.2. Conventions used in this document  

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

2. ECDHE_PSK Key Exchange Algorithm 

   The ciphersuites described in this document make use of the EC 
   parameter negotiation mechanism defined in RFC 4492.  When the 
   ciphersuites defined in this document are used, the

   'ec_diffie_hellman_psk' case inside the ServerKeyExchange and 
   ClientKeyExchange structure MUST be used instead of the 'psk' case 
   defined in [RFC4279] (i.e., the ServerKeyExchange and 
   ClientKeyExchange messages include the Diffie-Hellman parameters).  
   The PSK identity and identity hint fields have the same meaning and 
   encoding as specified in [RFC4279] (note that the ServerKeyExchange 
   message is always sent, even if no PSK identity hint is provided). 

   The format of the ServerKeyExchange and ClientKeyExchange messages is 
   shown below. 

         struct {  
             select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {  
                 /* other cases for rsa, diffie_hellman, etc. */  
                 case ec_diffie_hellman_psk:  /* NEW */  
                     opaque psk_identity_hint<0..2^16-1>;  
                     ServerECDHParams params;  
             };  
         } ServerKeyExchange;  

         struct {  
             select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {  
                 /* other cases for rsa, diffie_hellman, etc. */  
                 case ec_diffie_hellman_psk:   /* NEW */  
                     opaque psk_identity<0..2^16-1>;  
                     ClientECDiffieHellmanPublic public;  
             } exchange_keys;  
         } ClientKeyExchange; 

   The premaster secret is formed as follows.  First, perform the ECDH 
   computation as described in Section 5.10 of [RFC4492].  Let Z be the 
   octet string produced by this computation.  Next, concatenate a 
   uint16 containing the length of Z (in octets), Z itself, a uint16 
   containing the length of the PSK (in octets), and the PSK itself. 

   This corresponds to the general structure for the premaster secrets 
   (see Note 1 in Section 2 of [RFC4279]), with "other_secret" 
   containing Z. 

         struct { 
              opaque other_secret<0..2^16-1>;  
              opaque psk<0..2^16-1>;  
         };

3. ECDHE_PSK Based Cipher Suites 

3.1. ECDHE_PSK Cipher Suites Using the SHA-1 Hash 

   The following cipher suites match the cipher suites defined in 
   [RFC4279], except that they use an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman 
   exchange [RFC4492] authenticated with a PSK. 

      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_RC4_128_SHA          = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA     = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA      = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA      = {0xXX,0xXX}; 

   For all four cipher suites, the PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] with 
   SHA-1 as the hash function, and the MAC is HMAC [RFC2104] with SHA-1 
   as the hash function. 

3.2. ECDHE_PSK Cipher Suites Using SHA-2 Hashes 

      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256   = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384   = {0xXX,0xXX}; 

   The above two cipher suites are the same as the corresponding AES 
   cipher suites in section 3.1 above, except for the hash and PRF 
   algorithms, which SHALL be as follows: 

       For TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256, the PRF is the TLS PRF  
       [RFC5246] with SHA-256 as the hash function, and the MAC is HMAC  
       [RFC2104] with SHA-256 as the hash function. 

       For TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384, the PRF is the TLS PRF  
       [RFC5246] with SHA-384 as the hash function, and the MAC is HMAC  
       [RFC2104] with SHA-384 as the hash function. 

4. ECDHE_PSK Based Cipher Suites with NULL Encryption 

4.1. ECDHE_PSK Cipher Suites Using the SHA-1 Hash with NULL Encryption 

   The following cipher suite matches the cipher suites defined in 
   section 3.1, except that we define a suite with null encryption. 

      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA             = {0xXX,0xXX};  

4.2. ECDHE_PSK Cipher Suites Using SHA-2 Hashes with NULL Encryption 

      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA256          = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA384          = {0xXX,0xXX};

Internet-Draft     ECDHE_PSK Cipher Suites for TLS       September 2008 
    

   These two cipher suites are the same as the corresponding cipher 
   suites in section 3.2, but with NULL encryption (instead of AES). 

5. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations described throughout [RFC5246], 
   [RFC4785], [RFC4492], and [RFC4279] apply here as well.  In 
   particular, as authentication-only cipher suites (with no encryption) 
   defined here do not support confidentiality, care should be taken not 
   to send sensitive information (such as passwords) over connections 
   protected with one of the cipher suites with NULL encryption defined 
   in this document. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines the following new cipher suites, whose values 
   are to be assigned from the TLS Cipher Suite registry defined in 
   [RFC5246]. 

      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_RC4_128_SHA          = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA     = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA      = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA      = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256   = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384   = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA             = {0xXX,0xXX};  
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA256          = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA384          = {0xXX,0xXX};
