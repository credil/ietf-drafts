Internet-Draft                  Jabber-ID                  November 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), documented in
   [XMPP-CORE], is a streaming XML technology that enables any two
   entities on a network to exchange well-defined but extensible XML
   elements (called "XML stanzas") in close to real time.  Given XMPP's
   heritage in the Jabber open-source community, one of the primary uses
   for XMPP is instant messaging and presence as documented in
   [XMPP-IM], and XMPP addresses are still referred to as Jabber
   Identifiers or Jabber IDs.

   Because almost all human users of Jabber/XMPP instant messaging and
   presence systems also user email systems and because many such users
   also use netnews systems, it can be helpful for such users to specify
   their Jabber Identifiers in the messages they author.  The Jabber-ID
   header field provides a standard location for that information.
   Members of the Jabber instant messaging and presence community have
   been experimenting with this usage for several years.  As a result,
   this document provides informational documentation regarding the
   syntax and implementation of the Jabber-ID header field, including
   the information necessary to register the Jabber-ID field in the
   Provisional Message Header Field Registry maintained by the IANA.

   Naturally it may be beneficial to define a more general header field
   (or fields) that can be used by non-XMPP instant messaging and
   presence systems.  In all likelihood the result would be one header
   field encapsulating a URI that conforms to the "im:" scheme (see
   [CPIM]) and a second header field encapsulating a URI that conforms
   to the "pres:" scheme (see [CPP]).  Experience gained with the
   Jabber-ID header field within the Jabber instant messaging and
   presence community should provide helpful input to the process of
   defining those more general header fields.


2.  Syntax

   The syntax of the Jabber-ID header field is defined below using
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (as specified by [ABNF]), where the
   "pathxmpp" rule is defined in [XMPP-URI] and the remaining rules are
   defined in [MESSAGE]:

   "Jabber-ID:" SP *WSP pathxmpp *WSP CRLF

   Note: Although a native XMPP address may contain virtually any
   [UNICODE] character, an electronic mail header may contain only
   printable [US-ASCII] characters (see Section 2 of [MESSAGE]).
   Therefore, any characters outside the US-ASCII range in an XMPP
   address must be converted to US-ASCII before inclusion in a Jabber-ID

Internet-Draft                  Jabber-ID                  November 2007


   header field, in accordance with the rules specified in [XMPP-URI].
   In addition, characters allowed in XMPP node identifiers and XMPP
   resource identifiers but disallowed by the relevant URI rules must be
   percent-encoded in accordance with the rules specified in [URI]; for
   details, see [XMPP-URI].


3.  Implementation

3.1.  Inclusion

   The Jabber-ID header field is associated with the author of the
   message; see [MESSAGE].  If the "From:" header field contains more
   than one mailbox, the Jabber-ID header field should not be added to
   the message.  There should be no more than one instance of the
   Jabber-ID header field.

3.2.  Generation

   For a user whose XMPP address is "juliet@example.com", the
   corresponding Jabber-ID header field would be:

   Jabber-ID: juliet@example.com

   As noted, non-US-ASCII characters in XMPP addresses must be converted
   into US-ASCII before inclusion in a Jabber-ID header field.  Consider
   the following XMPP address:

   ji&#x159;i@&#x10D;echy.example

   Note: The string "&#x159;" stands for the Unicode character LATIN
   SMALL LETTER R WITH CARON and the string "&#x10D;" stands for the
   Unicode character LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CARON, following the "XML
   Notation" used in [IRI] to represent characters that cannot be
   rendered in ASCII-only documents (note also that these characters are
   represented in their stringprep canonical form; see [STRINGPREP]).
   For those who do not read Czech, this example could be Anglicized as
   "george@czech-lands.example".

   Following the rules in [XMPP-URI] and the Jabber-ID header field
   syntax, the resulting header field would be:

   Jabber-ID:
          ji%C5%99i@%C4%8Dechy.example

3.3.  Processing

   Upon receiving an email message containing a Jabber-ID header field,
   a mail user agent (MUA) that supports the field should process the
   field by converting any escaped characters to characters outside the
   US-ASCII range in accordance with the rules specified in [XMPP-URI],
   thus yielding a Jabber Idenfitier that can be used for native
   communication on an XMPP network.

3.4.  Disposition

   A mail user agent (MUA) that has processed a Jabber-ID header field
   may provide appropriate interface elements if it has independent
   information linking the author of the email message with the
   specified Jabber Identifier (e.g., via a user-controlled address book
   or automated directory lookup).  Such interface elements might
   include an indicator of "presence" (i.e., that the author is online
   and available for communication via XMPP) if the user is subscribed
   to the presence of the author, and an element that enables the user
   to initiate a text chat with the author.


4.  IANA Considerations

   In accordance with [REG], the IANA registers the "Jabber-ID" header
   field in the Provisional Message Header Field Registry.  The
   registration template is as follows:

   Header field name:  Jabber-ID
   Applicable protocol:  mail, netnews
   Status:  provisional
   Author/Change controller:  XMPP Registrar <mailto:registrar@xmpp.org>
   Specification document(s):  draft-saintandre-jabberid-06 [Note to
      IANA and RFC Editor: Replace I-D name with RFC XXXX, where "XXXX"
      is the number of the RFC that results from this specification, if
      any]
   Related information:  For details regarding the native usage and
      format of Jabber Identifiers, see Extensible Messaging and
      Presence Protocol (RFC 3920).


5.  Security Considerations

   Message headers are an existing standard and are designed to easily
   accommodate new types.  Although the Jabber-ID header field may be
   forged, this problem is inherent in Internet email; however, because
   a forged Jabber-ID header field may break automated processing,
   applications should not depend on the Jabber-ID header field to

   indicate the authenticity of an email message or the identity of its
   author or sender.  Including the Jabber-ID header field among the
   signer header fields in DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) can help to
   mitigate against forging of the header (see [DKIMSIG]).

   Advertising XMPP addresses in email headers may make it easier for
   malicious users to harvest XMPP addresses and therefore to send
   unsolicited bulk communications to the users or applications
   represented by those addresses.  Care should be taken in balancing
   the benefits of open information exchange against the potential costs
   of unwanted communication.  An email user agent that is capable of
   including the Jabber-ID header field in outgoing email messages
   should provide an option for its user to disable inclusion of the
   Jabber-ID header field generally, on a per-recipient basis, and on a
   per-message basis.

   The security considerations discussed in [IRI], [URI], [XMPP-CORE],
   [XMPP-IM], and [XMPP-URI] may also apply to the Jabber-ID message
   header.
