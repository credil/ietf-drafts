Abstract 
    
   This document discusses potential future extensions on the current 
   work plan of recently approved WG MultiMob (Multicast Mobility).  
   MultiMob charter explicitly states that scope of work will be limited
   to mobility protocols Proxy Mobile IPv6, and multicast group 
   management in terms of IGMPv3/MLDv2 protocols.  Furthermore only
   listener mobility will be dealt with and any modification to these
   existing protocols and to multicast routing protocols are out of
   scope.
   
   From an operational point of view, however, though such a basic
   solution is essential, there challenges with efficient resource
   utilization and user perceived service quality still persist.  As
   these issues may prevent large scale deployments of mobile multicast
   applications this document attempts to identify topics for future
   extension of work for WG MultiMob such as
 
   o  modifying base PMIPv6 and MLD/IGMP for optimal multicast support

   o  extending to and modifying of MIPv4/v6 and DSMIP

   o  sender (source) mobility

   o  consideration of Handover optimization 

   o  multiple flows

   o  multi-hop transmission

   o  any other different issues

   Intention of this document is to start and prepare for discussion on
   potential re-chartering after scheduled work. 


Introduction


   Recently chartered WG MultiMob focusses on documentation of proper
   configuaration and usage of existing (specified standard) protocols
   within both mobility and multicast related areas to enable and
   support mobility for multicast services and vice versa.  Although the
   final recommendation is not yet available it is expected that such a
   solution following either the employed remote subscription aproach or
   a traditional bidirectional tunneling will not be resource efficient
   nor grant the service quality expected by the end user.

                         multimob-future-work             October 2009  
   Such a solution would resolve the problem to ensure multicast
   reception in PMIPv6-enabled [1] networks without appropriate
   multicast support.  However it would neither automatically minimize
   multicast forwarding delay to provide seamless and fast handovers for
   real-time services nor minimize packet loss and reordering that
   result from multicast handover management as stated in [6]. Also
   Route Optimization is out of scope of the basic solution - an issue
   for reducing amount of transport resource usage and transmission
   delay. Thus possible enhancements and issues for solutions beyond a
   basic solution are described to enable current PMIP6 protocols to
   fully support efficient mobile multicast services. Such extensions
   may include protocol modifications for both mobility and multicast
   related protocols to achieve optimizations for resource efficient and
   performance increasing multimob approaches.  The document includes
   the case of mobile multicast senders using Any Source Multicast (ASM)
   and Source Specific Multicast (SSM).

   In summary additional to a 'Single hop, link, flow' Proxy MIP
   mobility for listening MNs as shown in Fig. 1 the future work will
   extend the scenario to 'Multi-hop, -homed, -flow' client mobility
   (see Fig. 2).
    
   Potential extension of the basic solution could cover issues as

2. Problem Description 
    
   The general issues if multicast mobility are extensively discussed
   and described in [6].  To reduce the complexity of the pleothera of
   requirements listed in [6] this document tries to propose lightweight
   solutions for multicast mobility which allow for easy deployment 
   within realistic scenarios and architectures, and which build
   directly on basic MultiMob solution to be provided as a first outcome
   of MultiMob WG as e.g. proposal [7], [8], or [9].


3. Issues for Modification of Future Multicast Mobility Protocols

   3.1  Modification of base PMIPv6 and MLD/IGMP for optimal multicast
        support

        3.1.1 Modification of PMIPv6
 
   Solutions proposed within this section are either agent-based, rely
   on additional encapsulation or may be of a hybrid approach.
   Since other functional enhancements of PMIPv6 are currently under way
   in WG NETEXT both the impact of new features on Mobile Multicast as
   well as a potential Multicast-initiated proposal for PMIPv6
   modification have to be considered in a continuous exchange process
   between both WGs.

        3.1.2 Modification of MLD/IGMP

   Potential approaches for enhancement of group management as
   specified e.g. by MLDv2 [2] include default timer value modification,
   specific query message introduction, and standard (query) reaction
   suppression, beside introducing multicast router attendance control
   in terms of e.g. specification of a Listener Hold message. 

3.2  Extension to and modifying of MIPv4/v6 and DSMIP

   Operational interest clearly focusses on network-based mobility
   approaches, but in the framework of multiple technologies serving a
   mobile user there will be demand to include also other non-PMIPv6


von Hugo, et al.         Expires - April 2010                   [Page 5] 
                         multimob-future-work             October 2009 

   
   based specifications.

   This section addresses the compatibility of PMIPv6-based multicast 
   solutions with MIPv6 [5], i.e. handover between network-based and
   client mobility support as well as interoperabiliy between IPv4 and
   IPv6 mechanisms (e.g. FA handling, IPv4/v4-tunneling) with mobile
   multicast.  DSMIP (RFC 5454, [3]) deals with multicast group
   membership control messages such as MLD or MLDv2 [2], but does not
   specify how to achieve group management and data forwarding unless
   the Home Agent (HA) is a fully functional IPv6 multicast router. 

   3.3  Consideration of sender (source) mobility

   We see future demand for such a feature in terms of applications such
   as 'Push to talk over wireless technologies' (packet based P2MP group
   voice) like 3GPP or WiMAX, 'Multi-party mobile audio/video
   conferencing', 'mobile multi-player gaming' etc, where due to
   real-time constraints a solution based on a central server might add
   too much delay.

   According to [6] generally (i.e. for ASM) a mobile multicast source
   must provide address transparency at Routing - for Reverse Path
   Forwarding (RPF) checks - as well as on Transport layer - to coincide
   with packet source address at receiver side.  Further issues are
   temporal handover constraints, possible packet loss and multicast
   scoping, and enhanced complexity of inter-domain multicasting.
   Additional challenges arise for SSM (Source Specific Multicast) due
   to the principle of multicast decoupling between sender and
   receivers.
	 
   3.4  Consideration of Handover optimization 

   This work item would deal with reduction of delay, packet loss, and
   packet reordering effort.  In case these degradations are induced due
   to terminal movement it will be discussed how to make use of MIPSHOP
   approaches such as HMIP, FMIP etc. (predominantly focussing on
   intra-technology handover).  Reusing multicast specific protocol
   extensions exceeding IGMP/MLD modifications shall further decrease
   the impact of group management induced delay. 

   3.5  Support of multiple flows

   Considering a per-flow handover for parallel multicast sessions
   allows to treat different services requirements and labels of flows
   independently.  This would improve user perceived service performance
   as well as allow for more efficient usage of network resources
   because of the enabled flexibility.

   3.6  Multi-hop transmission

   This scenario adds another level of complexity to Multicast Mobility
   and is of interest e.g. in nested NEMO (Network Mobility, RFC 3963
   [4]) scenarios, for MANETs (Mobile Adhoc NETworks) where also
   mechanisms for multicast forwarding are dicussed, e.g. in terms of
   Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF, [9]) or for infrastructure mesh
   networks.

    
4. Security Considerations 
    
   This document summarizes discussion of multicast extensions to
   mobility.  New methods or procedures have not been proposed.
   Relevant issues for security and security have already been mentioned
   exhaustively in [6].
    
    
5. Summary and Future Steps 
    
   This document shall provide a future extension of the scope of
   Multicast Mobility within the framework of IETF WG with focus on
   deployable and operational solutions.
    

6. IANA Considerations 
    
   There are no IANA considerations introduced by this draft.
