Internet-Draft             PANA Relay Element               October 2010


1.  Introduction

   PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)
   [RFC5191] is a UDP-based protocol to perform EAP authentication
   between a PaC (PANA Client) and a PAA (PANA Authentication Agent).

   This document specifies PANA Relay Element (PRE) functionality which
   enables PANA messaging between a PaC and a PAA where the two nodes
   cannot reach each other by means of regular IP routing.  For example,
   in the ZigBee IP architecture (Editor's Note: a reference to the
   ZigBee IP specification is to be added here when it is under public
   review), a joining node (PaC) can only use a link-local IPv6 address
   to communicate with a parent router prior to PANA authentication.
   The PAA typically resides in a 6LBR (6LowPAN Border Router)
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd] which is often multiple IP hops away from the
   PaC.  The PRE implemented on the parent router is used for relaying
   PANA messages between the PaC and the PAA in this scenario.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  PANA Relay Element

   The PANA Relay Element (PRE) is a node that is located between the
   PaC and the PAA.  It is responsible for relaying the PANA messages
   between the PaC and the PAA.  The PRE does not need to maintain per-
   PaC state.  From the PaC's perspective, the PRE appears as the PAA.
   Normal IP routing is performed between the PRE and the PAA.  It is
   assumed that the PRE's IP address that is reachable from the PaC is
   known to the PaC prior to PANA authentication by some means that is
   not specified in this document.  It is also assumed that the PAA's IP
   address that is reachable from the PRE is known to the PRE by some
   means that is not specified in this document.

   The PRE and the PAA support the relay operation as follows.

   The relay operation requires that a PANA session is initiated by the
   PaC, i.e., the first message that the PRE relays for any PANA session
   is a PCI (PANA-Client-Initiation) message.

   When the PRE receives a PANA message from the PaC, it creates a PANA-
   Relay (PRY) message containing a Relayed-Message AVP and a PaC-

Internet-Draft             PANA Relay Element               October 2010


   Information AVP.  The Relayed-Message AVP encapsulates the entire
   PANA Message received from the PaC.  The PaC-Information AVP contains
   the PaC's IP address and UDP port number.  The PRY message is sent to
   the PAA.

   When the PAA receives the PRY, it retrieves the PaC-originated PANA
   message from the Relayed-Message AVP and the PaC's IP address and UDP
   port number from the PaC-Information AVP.  The PaC-originated PANA
   message is processed in the same way as specified in RFC 5191, with
   the following exceptions:

   (a) The PAA uses the source IP address and the source port number of
   the PCI and the source IP address and UDP port number of the PRY to
   identify the PaC among multiple PCI messages sent from different
   PaCs.

   (b) The PaC's IP address and UDP port number are maintained in the
   PANA session attribute "IP address and UDP port number of the PaC".

   (c) The source IP address and UDP port number of the PRY is stored in
   a new PANA session attribute "IP address and UDP port number of the
   PRE".  A PANA session is referred to as a relayed PANA session if
   this attribute has a non-null value.

   When the PAA originates a PANA message for a relayed PANA session, it
   sends a PRY message to the PRE's IP address and UDP port number.  The
   PRY message includes a Relayed-Message AVP containing the PAA-
   originated PANA message and also includes a PaC-Information AVP
   containing the PaC's IP address and UDP port number.

   When the PRE receives the PRY message, it retrieves the PAA-
   originated PANA message from the Relayed-Message and the PaC's IP
   address and UDP port number from and PaC-Information AVPs.  The PAA-
   originated PANA message is sent to the PaC's IP address and UDP port
   number.

   The Session Identifier and Sequence Number of a PRY message are set
   to zero.  A PRY message is never retransmitted by the PRE or the PAA.
   The PRE and PAA do not advance their incoming or outgoing sequence
   numbers for request when transmitting or receiving a PRY message.
   Note that the PANA message carried in a Relayed-Message may be
   retransmitted by the PaC or PAA, leading to transmission of another
   PRY carrying the same Relayed-Message.

   When the PRE or the PAA that receives a PCI does not have sufficient
   resources to perform PANA authentication, it MAY return a PANA-Error
   (PER) message with Error-Code "PANA_RESOURCE_SHORTAGE" to the PaC.  A
   PAA-generated PER in response to a relayed PCI is also relayed.

   If direct IP routing becomes available (e.g., after the successful
   PANA authentication as in the case of Zigbee IP), the PaC may choose
   to directly communicate with the PAA without use of the relay
   operation.  The IP address update procedure defined in [RFC5191] may
   be performed to switch to non-relay operation.

   Figure 1 is an example message flow with a PRE.

   IP2a is used for communicating with PaC.
   IP2b is used for communicating with PAA.
   The two IP address may be the same.

   IP3 is the IP address of PAA.

   p1 is PaC-assigned UDP port number.  p2 is PRE-assigned UDP port number.

3.  PANA messages for Relay Operation

3.1.  PANA-Relay

   The PANA-Relay (PRY) message is sent by the PRE to the PAA or by the
   PAA to the PRE.  It contains one PaC-Information AVP and one Relayed-
   Message AVP.  The PRY message SHOULD NOT carry other AVPs.

   In a PRE-originated PRY message, the PaC-Information AVP contains an
   IP address and the UDP port number of the PANA message that was
   originated by the PaC and is contained in the Relayed-Message AVP.

   In a PAA-originated PRY message, the information in the PaC-
   Information AVP MUST be copied from the "IP address and UDP port
   number of the PaC" attribute of the associated PANA session
   [RFC5191].

   The Session Identifier and Sequence Number field of any PRY message
   MUST be set to zero.  A PRY message MUST NOT be retransmitted by the
   PRE or the PAA.  The PRE and PAA MUST NOT advance their incoming or
   outgoing sequence numbers for request when transmitting or receiving
   a PRY message.

      PANA-Relay ::= < PANA-Header: TBD>
                     { PaC-Information }
                     { Relayed-Message }
                    *[ AVP ]


3.2.  PANA-Error

   The PANA-Error (PER) message is sent to notify the peer node of an
   error caused by the message received from the peer.  It contains one
   Error-Code AVP.  The PER message MAY carry other AVPs.

      PANA-Error  ::= < PANA-Header: TBD >
                      { Error-Cause }
                   *  [ AVP ]


   This document specifies only one use case for this message, i.e., the
   PRE or the PAA may send a PER in response to a PCI when it does not
   have sufficient resources to perform PANA authentication.  In this
   use case, the PER is sent before establishing initial sequence
   numbers, assigning a session identifier or establishing a PANA SA.
   Therefore, both the sequence number and session identifier fields of
   the PER are set to zero (0), no AUTH AVP is included in the PER and
   the PER is not retransmitted.

4.  PANA AVPs for Relay Operation

4.1.  PaC-Information AVP

   The PaC-Information AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and
   contains an IP address (16-octet for an IPv6 address or 4-octet for
   an IPv4 address) followed by a 2-octet UDP port number of the PaC,
   both encoded in network-byte order.

4.2.  Relayed-Message AVP

   The Relayed-Message (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and
   contains a relayed PANA message.

4.3.  Error-Cause AVP

   The Error-Cause AVP (AVP Code TBD) is used for indicating the cause
   of the error associated with the message received by the sender of
   the PER.  The AVP data is of type Unsigned32 The following Error-
   Cause data value is defined in this document.

   PANA_RESOURCE_SHORTAGE                  1

      This error is returned when there is no sufficient resources to
      perform PANA authentication.


5.  Security Considerations

   Since the PRE does not maintain per-PaC state, the PRE is robust
   against resource consumption DoS (Deniable of Service) attack.  The
   security properties of the PaC and PAA remain the same as [RFC5191].

   PANA [RFC5191] can be used over unsecure links.  EAP and PANA
   protocols are designed in a way that the PANA messaging does not
   require cryptographic security during the authentication phase.  The
   only additional payload carried between the PRE and the PAA are the
   IP address and UDP port number values which are already carried by
   the UDP/IP headers unsecurely between the PaC and the PRE.
   Therefore, PRY messages do not require any additional cryptographic
   protection, whether at the PANA layer or a lower layer.  If a future
   document defines additional payload AVPs for the PRY messages, there
   may be a need to define additional security for those messages.

   Error notification in the initial exchange using a PANA-Error message
   is not protected with a PANA SA and is vulnerable to spoofing
   attacks.  Therefore, the receiver SHOULD use such error notification
   only as a hint to take an appropriate action to deal with the

   potentially erroneous situation.


6.  IANA Considerations

   As described in Section 3 and Section 4, and following the new IANA
   allocation policy on PANA messages [RFC5872], two Message Types and
   three PANA AVP Codes need to be assigned.

   o  One standard Message Type for PANA-Relay (PRY) message.

   o  One standard Message Type for PANA-Error (PER) message.

   o  One standard AVP Code for PaC-Information AVP.

   o  One standard AVP Code for Relayed-Message AVP.

   o  One standard AVP Code for Error-Cause AVP.

6.1.  The Error-Cause AVP values

   As defined in Section 4.3, the Error-Cause AVP (AVP Code TBD) defines
   the value 1.

   All remaining values are available for assignment via IETF Review or
   IESG Approval [RFC5226].
