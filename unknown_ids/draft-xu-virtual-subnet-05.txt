Internet-Draft               Virtual Subnet                  April 2011 
 
    
1. Introduction 

   To achieve service agility to the full extent of current virtual 
   machine technology, cloud data center operators are demanding 
   solutions for VM mobility across data centers of geographically 
   dispersed locations. In this challenging environment, a solution 
   that enables fast, reliable, high-capacity and highly scalable data 
   center interconnection is essential. Virtual Private LAN Service 
   (VPLS) [RFC4761, RFC4762] is an available technology for such demand 
   today. However, some scalability issues associated with the flat 
   Layer2 Ethernet network (e.g., ARP broadcast storm, unknown unicast 
   flooding etc.) would badly impact the network performance when 
   extending such flat Layer2 Ethernet network to a much wider scope. 

   This document describes a scalable IP-only L2VPN solution called 
   Virtual Subnet (VS), which reuses BGP/MPLS IP VPN [RFC4364] and ARP 
   proxy [RFC925][RFC1027] technologies. VS aims to be used for data 
   center interconnection. In contrast with the existing VPLS solution, 
   VS alleviates the broadcast storm impact on the network performance 
   to a great extent by splitting the otherwise whole ARP broadcast and 
   unknown unicast flooding domain associated with an IP subnet into 
   multiple isolated parts, besides, the MAC table capacity demand on 
   CE switches is greatly reduced due to the usage of ARP proxy.  

   Note that non-IP traffic would not be supported in VS since VS 
   provides an IP-only L2VPN service.  

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4364], [MVPN], 
   [RFC2236] and [RFC2131].  

3. Solution Description 

3.1. Unicast 

  3.1.1. Intra-subnet Unicast 

   As shown in Figure 1, CE hosts located in different VPN sites of a 
   given IP-only L2VPN instance are within the same IP subnet (e.g., 
   10.0.0.0/8). PE routers create host routes for their local CE hosts 
   automatically according to the corresponding ARP entries. Instead of 
   distributing routes for their configured VPN subnets, PE routers 
   distribute these host routes to each other. In addition, PE routers 
   each are configured with a null route for the VPN subnet. Thus, upon 
   receiving CE packets destined for nonexistent hosts of that subnet,

   ingress PE routers would discard them directly according to the null 
   route mentioned above. Meanwhile, APR proxy is enabled on the VRF 
   interfaces of each PE router, thus, upon receiving from a local CE 
   host an ARP request for a known remote CE host, ingress PE router 
   would return its own MAC address as a response.

                      Figure 1: Intra-subnet Unicast 

   Assume host A sends an ARP request for host B before communicating 
   with host B, upon the receipt of this ARP request, PE-1 lookups the 
   associated VRF table to find the corresponding host route for host B. 
   If that route is found and it is learnt from a remote PE router, PE-
   1, as ARP proxy, returns its own MAC address as a response to the 
   above ARP request. Otherwise, PE-1 doesn't need to respond to that 
   ARP request. Once receiving the above ARP reply from PE-1, host A 
   would send an IP packet to B with destination MAC address of PE-1's 
   MAC address. PE-1, as ingress PE router, tunnels the above packet 
   towards the egress PE router (i.e., PE-2) which in turn forwards the 
   packet to the destination CE host (i.e., host B).

   with other hosts outside its subnet, a PE router (e.g., PE-2) which

   is connected to a CE gateway router (e.g., GW) SHOULD be configured 
   with a default route of that VPN with next-hop of that CE gateway 
   router, and then advertise such default route to other PE routers.

                      Figure 2: Inter-subnet Unicast 

   Assume host A sends an ARP request for its gateway (i.e., GW) before 
   sending a packet to a destination host outside its subnet. Upon 
   receiving this ARP request, PE-1 returns its own MAC address as a 
   response in accordance with the rules described in section 3.1.1. 
   Host A then sends an IP packet to that destination host with 
   destination MAC address of PE-1's MAC. Upon receiving the above 
   packet, PE-1, as ingress PE router, tunnels it towards the 
   corresponding egress PE router (i.e., PE-2) according to the default 
   route announced from PE-2. PE-2 as egress PE router, in turn, 
   forwards the packet to the CE gateway router (i.e., GW) according to 
   the configured default route.  

   Since PE routers of that VPN each have been configured with a null 
   route, those packets destined for nonexistent CE hosts of that VPN 
   subnet would be dropped directly by ingress PE routers, rather than 
   being mistakenly forwarded to the CE gateway router.

Internet-Draft               Virtual Subnet                  April 2011 
 
   For redundancy purpose, more than one CE gateway router would be 
   connected to a given VPN subnet via separate PE routers. In this 
   case, Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) [RFC2338] SHOULD run 
   among these CE routers, besides, only the PE router which is 
   connected to the Virtual Router Master is entitled to announce a 
   default route for that VPN subnet. To achieve that goal, the next-
   hop of the default route SHOULD be set to the corresponding Virtual 
   Router IP address, and the default route SHOULD not be deemed as 
   valid unless there is a directly connected host route for the next-
   hop address. Due to the fact that only the Virtual Router Master is 
   entitled to respond to ARP requests for the corresponding Virtual 
   Router IP address and broadcast gratuitous ARP requests or replies 
   on behave of the Virtual Router, only the PE router which is 
   connected to the Virtual Router Master could have an ARP entry 
   corresponding to the Virtual Router IP address and therefore could 
   have a directly connected host route for the Virtual Router IP 
   address. In this way, packets destined for the outside of a given 
   VPN subnet would be exactly sent to the corresponding Virtual Router 
   Master. 

3.2. Multicast/Broadcast 

   The MVPN technology [MVPN], in particular, the Protocol-Independent-
   Multicast (PIM) tree option with some extensions, could be reused 
   here to support IP multicast and broadcast between CE hosts of the 
   same VPN. For example, PE routers attached to a given VPN join a 
   default provider multicast distribution tree which is dedicated for 
   that VPN. Ingress PE routers, upon receiving customer multicast or 
   broadcast traffic from their local CE hosts, tunnel such customer 
   traffic towards remote PE routers of the same VPN over the 
   corresponding default provider multicast distribution tree. When 
   receiving customer multicast or broadcast traffic over a provider 
   multicast distribution tree, egress PE routers forward such customer 
   traffic via the corresponding VRF interfaces.  

   More details about how to support multicast and broadcast in VS will 
   be explored in a later version of this document. 

   3.3. CE Host Discovery 

   When receiving an ARP request or reply from a local CE host, PE 
   router SHOULD cache or update the corresponding ARP entry for that 
   CE host. In addition, PE router SHOULD periodically send ARP 
   requests to each learnt local CE host in unicast so as to keep the 
   learnt ARP entries fresh.

Internet-Draft               Virtual Subnet                  April 2011 
 
   To assure a PE router discovers all local CE hosts in time, this PE 
   router SHOULD perform IP or ARP scan on its local VPN site at least 
   once when rebooting up. One option is to use ICMP echo for host 
   discovery. For example, PE router could send an ICMP echo request to 
   IP broadcast address through its VRF interfaces, every CE host 
   attached to the corresponding VPN sites will respond with an ICMP 
   echo reply when receiving that ICMP echo request. Hence, the PE 
   router could learn the IP and MAC pairs of all local CE hosts by 
   inspecting the source IP and MAC addresses in the received ICMP echo 
   replies. 

   3.4. CE Multi-homing 

   When a VPN site is multi-homed to more than one PE router for 
   redundancy purpose, VRRP SHOULD run among these PE routers, besides, 
   only the Virtual Router Master SHOULD respond to the ARP requests 
   from local CE hosts and it MUST use the Virtual Router MAC address 
   in any ARP packet it sends. 

   To achieve active-active multi-homing (i.e., remote PE routers could 
   send customer traffic destined for a given multi-homed VPN site via 
   either PE router of that multi-homed VPN site), those PE routers of 
   VRRP Slave could also perform the host discovery function and 
   accordingly advertise host routes for local CE hosts as the PE 
   router of VRRP master does.  

   Note that there is no contravention to the VRRP specification 
   [RFC2338].  

   3.5. CE Host Mobility 

   Once a CE host moves from one VPN site to another, it will usually 
   send out a gratuitous ARP request or reply when attaching to a new 
   VPN site. The PE router attached to the new VPN site will generate a 
   directly connected CE host route upon receiving that gratuitous ARP 
   request or reply.  

   When the PE router attached to the old VPN site receives a host 
   route announcement for one of its local CE hosts from a remote PE 
   router, it SHOULD immediately send an ARP request for that CE host 
   through the corresponding VRF interface to determine whether that CE 
   host is still connected to itself. If no corresponding ARP reply is 
   received in a short amount of time, the PE router SHOULD delete the 
   corresponding ARP entry of that CE host and accordingly withdraw the 
   corresponding host route. Meanwhile, the PE router SHOULD broadcast 
   a gratuitous ARP through the corresponding VRF interface on behalf 
   of that CE host, with the sender hardware address field being filled

Internet-Draft               Virtual Subnet                  April 2011 
 
   with its own MAC addresses. As a result, the ARP entry for that CE 
   host cached on other local CE hosts would be updated correctly.  

   3.6. APR Proxy 

   A PE router, as ARP proxy, SHOULD only respond to ARP requests for 
   those CE hosts which are exactly attached to other PE routers. In 
   other words, the PE router SHOULD not respond to ARP requests for 
   its local CE hosts or those nonexistent CE hosts.  

   When VRRP runs between multiple PE routers which are attached to the 
   same VPN site, only the PE router which is Virtual Router Master is 
   entitled to perform the ARP proxy function.  

4. Comparison between VS and VPLS on Scalability 

   Since PE routers in VPLS work much similar as Spanning Tree Protocol 
   (STP) bridges, most scalability issues associated with the STP 
   bridge protocol (e.g., ARP broadcast storm, unknown unicast flooding, 
   etc.) are intactly inherited to VPLS.  

   By splitting the otherwise whole ARP broadcast and unknown unicast 
   flooding domain of a subnet into multiple isolated parts, VS 
   alleviates the broadcast storm impact on network performance to a 
   great extent. For example, ARP broadcast traffic is limited within 
   the scope of a VPN site. Similarly, unknown unicast traffic would 
   not be flooded across the MPLS/IP backbone as well. 

   As for the MAC table capacity requirement on CE switches, CE 
   switches in VPLS would have to learn the MAC addresses of both local 
   CE hosts and remote CE hosts while CE switches in VS only needs to 
   learn the MAC addresses of local CE hosts and local PE routers.  

5. Future work 

   How to support IPv6 CE hosts in VS is for future study. 

6. Security Considerations 

   TBD. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   There is no requirement for IANA.
