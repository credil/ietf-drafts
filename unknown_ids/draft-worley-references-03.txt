Internet-Draft            SIP References header                 May 2009


Abstract

   This document defines a SIP extension header, References, to be used
   within SIP messages to signify that the message (and the dialog
   containing it) is related to one or more other dialogs.  It is
   expected to be used largely for diagnostic purposes.

Internet-Draft            SIP References header                 May 2009


1.  Purpose of the References Header

   In many situations, the processing of a SIP "telephone call" involves
   a number of different SIP dialogs.  Of course, the existing SIP
   headers provide adequate information for the SIP elements to carry
   out the needed operations.  But in many cases, it is difficult for an
   observer to identify from a network trace the particular SIP dialogs
   that are involved in one operation.

   For example, if a user agent receives a REFER message within one
   dialog, it sends an INVITE to establish a new dialog which replaces
   the previous one within the user interface of the user agent.  But
   since the connection between the new dialog and the old dialog is
   only realized within the user agent, there is no algorithmic way to
   associate the two dialogs based on the SIP messages alone -- the best
   available technique is to extract all the messages to/from the
   particular user agent, and then observe the INVITE that is sent
   immediately after receipt of the REFER.

   The purpose of the References header is to allow a SIP message to
   specify that the message carrying it (and by extension, the dialog
   that contains the message) is related to one or more other dialogs,
   specified by their Call-Id values.  Ideally, when given a Call-Id, an
   automated process can use the connections between dialogs specified
   in References headers to determine the entire set of dialogs that are
   needed to understand a complete "telephone call" or other SIP
   interaction.

2.  Syntax and Semantics

   The syntax of the References header is as follows.  (All rules not
   defined here are taken from section 25.1 of RFC 3261[sip].)

    message-header  =/ References
    References      =  "References" HCOLON reference *(COMMA reference)
    reference       =  callid *( SEMI reference-param )
    reference-param =  rel-param / generic-param
    rel-param       =  "rel" EQUAL rel-value
    rel-value       =  "chain" / "inquiry" / "refer" / "sequel"
                    /  "xfer" /  gen-value

   Multiple References headers may appear in a SIP message, and their
   values may be combined or separated as allowed by section 7.3 of RFC
   3261[sip].  The ordering of References values is not significant.

   The call-id values of the Replaces and Join headers are considered
   implicit References values and so SHOULD NOT be specified in
   References headers.

   The presence of a References header in a SIP message means that the
   message (and by implication, the dialog containing it) is related to
   the dialog(s) bearing the specified Call-Id(s).  Note that since
   there is no way to specify the to-tag and from-tag of the referenced
   dialog, the References header does not distinguish different dialogs
   that have the same Call-Id, and all dialogs sharing a Call-Id are
   considered to be related a priori.  The processor of References
   headers should consider the "related" relationship of dialogs to
   include the symmetric-transitive closure of the References
   relationship; that is, if a message in dialog A references dialog B,
   and a message in dialog B references dialog C, then all three dialogs
   should be considered related to each other.

   The nature of the relationship between the message's dialog and the
   referenced dialog(s) is indicated by the "rel" parameter (if it is
   present).  Since the message containing the References header is
   likely to be constrained to be generated after the creation of the
   dialog mentioned by the header, and the UA may not have control over
   this time-ordering, relationship natures are considered symmetric.
   E.g., a request with Call-Id A that performs an inquiry to assist in
   routing dialog B may contain "References: B;rel=inquiry", but the
   same meaning can be indicated by a message in dialog B containing
   "References: A;rel=inquiry".

   The currently defined values of the "rel" parameter are:

Internet-Draft            SIP References header                 May 2009


      "chain" meaning that this request is the logical continuation of
      the dialog with the specified Call-Id through a B2BUA or the like,
      in that it will carry media that have the same meaning to the user

      "inquiry" meaning that this request was generated to obtain
      information needed to properly process a request with the
      specified Call-Id.  (For example, in section 2.16, "Call Pickup"
      of [service-examples], a SUBSCRIBE is generated to discover the UA
      which sent an INVITE to a designated AOR.)

      "join" - this value is permanently reserved so that it may be used
      as a value of cognate data items when describing dialogs related
      by a "Join" header

      "refer" meaning that this request was generated due to a REFER
      with the specified Call-Id

      "replaces" - this value is permanently reserved so that it may be
      used as a value of cognate data items when describing dialogs
      related by a "Replaces" header

      "sequel" means that this dialog is the continuation of the
      conversation carried by the dialog with the specified Call-Id

      "xfer" meaning that the dialog of this message and the dialog with
      the specified Call-Id are the two legs of a consultative (or
      attended) transfer.  One endpoint of each dialog will become an
      endpoint of the final dialog.

   These values are case-sensitive (although the parameter name, "rel",
   is not).

   These values are the value of the ref-value after any quoting has
   been removed.  As shown in the ABNF, the quoting which may be applied
   to rel-value is the same as what may be applied to a gen-value,
   specifically, if it is surrounded by double-quotes, then any
   character may be quoted with a backslash.  Thus, 'References:
   12345600@atlanta.example.com;rel=xfer' is equivalent to 'References:
   12345600@atlanta.example.com;rel="xfer"' and 'References:
   12345600@atlanta.example.com;rel="\x\f\e\r"'

   It is expected that the References header will usually appear in the
   dialog-forming request of a dialog, but it may appear in any request
   or response.  Since 1xx responses are not delivered reliably, a
   References header value that is present only in a 1xx response may
   not be seen by an element that ought in principle to see the
   response, and such a value SHOULD be present in another message of
   the dialog going to that element.

   All parameters and parameter values that are not understood by the
   processor of the References header MUST be ignored.  Parameters and
   values that start with "X-" (case-insensitive) are reserved for non-
   standardized purposes.

   Note that while the SIP References header is similar in function to
   the Internet e-mail References header[message-format], they have
   different syntaxes and are not interchangeable.

3.  Examples

3.1.  B2BUA

   One use of References is to connect the two "sides" of a single
   logical dialog that passes through a B2BUA (which might not have the
   same Call-Id).

             Alice                B2BUA                 Bob
               |                    |                    |

3.2.  REFER

   One use of References is to connect a REFER to the INVITE that it
   causes to be sent.  A typical use of REFER is to implement blind
   transfer.  This example is taken from section 2.4, "Transfer -
   Unattended" of [service-examples].

3.3.  Attended Transfer

   An attended transfer normally involves three different dialogs.  If
   the transfer completes, and the REFER that completes the transfer has
   a References header, the References header in the REFER and the
   Replaces header in the resulting INVITE will suffice to connect the
   three dialogs.  However, to provide complete information if the
   transfer does not complete, the INVITE that establishes the "second

   leg" of the transfer scenario should have a References header naming
   the "first leg".  This example is taken from section 2.5, "Transfer -
   Attended" of [service-examples].

   As described in Section 3.2, the INVITE that completes the transfer
   has a References header giving the dialog of the first leg, within
   which the REFER was sent.  It also has a Replaces header giving the
   dialog of the second leg, which acts as an implicit References.

   After locating the target dialog, Bill's UA generates an INVITE-with-

   Note that the executing INVITE F7 does not mention the Call-Id of the
   original INVITE F1 because it is mentioned in the Replaces header.

   If the call pickup operation is done by an agent on behalf of Bill's
   UA (as in the sipX open-source PBX), the executing INVITE is likely
   to exist before the SUBSCRIBE is generated.  In that case, the

4.  Practical Experience

   The current version of the sipX open-source PBX adds a References
   header to the SUBSCRIBE of a call pickup as described in section
   2.16, "Call Pickup" of [service-examples].  It has caused no observed
   interoperability problem.

5.  Related Work

   This section discusses other Internet-drafts and their relationship
   to this work.

5.1.  draft-loreto-sipping-dialog-correlation

      The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Dialog
      Correlation[loreto-correlation]

      This document defines a new header field for use with SIP.  The
      Same-Session header field is used to logically correlate an
      existing SIP dialog with a new SIP dialog when the media sessions
      established by both dialogs can be considered a single logical
      session.  This mechanism can be used to share the user interface
      and other resources between all the media streams from both
      sessions.

   The "Same-Session" header prescribes that the media sessions of two
   INVITE dialog usages are to be considered part of the same session
   from the users' points of view.  Because of this semantic, it cannot
   be used in place of the References header, as References can be used
   to express the relationship between two dialogs that are not
   connected in any particular way in regard to user interface.

   However, it would be possible to define a "parallel" value of the
   "rel" parameter to have the semantics of "Same-Session".  This usage
   would require that the References header appears in the INVITE
   establishing the second dialog (and that the two INVITEs are properly
   time-sequenced, or that both INVITEs have a References header).  But
   this still might be considered a conflation of mechanism that have
   different semantics.

5.2.  draft-kaplan-sip-session-id

      A Session Identifier for the Session Initiation Protocol
      (SIP)[kaplan-session]

      There are several reasons for having a globally unique session
      identifier for the same SIP session, which can be maintained
      across B2BUA's and other SIP middle-boxes.  This draft proposes a
      new SIP header to carry such a value: Session-ID.

   The semantics of "Session-ID" are close to those of References, and
   it would be reasonable to define a "rel" value that meant that the
   referenced Call-Id was "the other side" of a B2BUA connection.  (This
   would require placing a References header in the INVITE request sent

   INVITE send from the originator side.)  But since References contains
   the real Call-Id of a dialog, this use would not have the security
   properties described in section 5.1 of [kaplan-session].

   A possible solution to this problem is for the B2BUA to create a
   "phantom" Call-Id that is suitably random, and use it in References
   headers sent in both the initial request and response.  By the
   transitivity propertySection 2, the dialogs on both sides of the
   B2BUA are declared to be related, even if the referenced dialog
   contains no messages.

   For two chained B2BUAs with no forking, this would give a message
   flow like this:

       UA 1            B2BUA 1         B2BUA 2         UA 2

            --->
            INVITE 123@aa.example.com
            Call-Id: qwerty@aa

                            --->
                            INVITE 123@transit.example.com
                            Call-Id: asdfgh@transit
                            References: QAZWSXEDCRFV;rel=chain

                                            --->
                                            INVITE 123@bb.example.com
                                            Call-Id: zxcvbn@bb
                                            References: QAZWSXEDCRFV
                                                 ;rel=chain

                                            <---
                                            SIP/2.0 200 OK
                                            Call-Id: zxcvbn@bb

   Note that B2BUA 2 does not create a new "References chain" value, but
   rather reuses the value it received in the initial INVITE.  (In
   principle, B2BUA 2 does not need to add References to the response it

6.  Security Considerations

   The specification of the relationship between two dialogs could in
   principle be a privacy issue.  But these relationships can usually be
   discerned by heuristic processing of the stream of SIP messages, and
   (with one exception) the author knows of no instance where the
   security or privacy properties of SIP have been based on the
   inability of an eavesdropper to determine that two SIP dialogs or
   messages are related.

   The one known privacy problem is the the "service provider privacy"
   problem discussed in [kaplan-session].  This situation is different
   from conventional "user security" situations because the eavesdropper
   is assumed to be unable to tap multiple points of the network, and
   the goal is to prevent the eavesdropper from obtaining information
   about parts of the network that the eavesdropper cannot directly
   access.  This sort of privacy can be provided by constructing
   artificial Call-Ids to use in References headers, if References is
   inserted in both requests and responses.

      draft-worley-references-03

   Added the "rel=chain" and "rel=sequel" values.

   Reserved the "rel=replaces" and "rel=join" values.

   Added B2BUA example for "rel=chain".

7.2.  Changes from draft-worley-references-01 to
      draft-worley-references-02

   Specified that the value of the "rel" parameter is not affected by
   any quoting which is applied.

   Specified that the value of the "rel" parameter is case-sensitive.

   Categorize the References header as experimental.

7.3.  Changes from draft-worley-references-00 to
      draft-worley-references-01

   Add the "rel" parameter.

   Note that References will usually appear in the dialog-forming
   request.
