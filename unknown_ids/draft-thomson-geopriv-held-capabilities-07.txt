1.  Introduction

   A Device is a good source of information about its location.  Even
   where a Device is unable to independently determine its location, it
   can often make observations about its environment and network
   attachment that are of use in determining its position.  Making this
   information available to the Location Information Server (LIS) in the
   access network can improve the quality of location estimates for the
   Device.

   Requests that retrieve location information by value are largely
   covered by the measurement information and data formats described in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements].  However, location
   information provided through location URIs cannot utilise this
   information.

   This document outlines a method whereby a Device indicates
   capabilities to a LIS during the creation of a HELD context (see
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context]).  The LIS is able to then
   exercise those capabilities to assist it in the generation of
   location information, or to acquire location information from the
   Device.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   This document relies on definitions from a range of specification.
   Use of the terms LIS and Device is consistent with
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery].  Location measurement is
   defined in [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements] and location
   estimate is defined in [I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty].  The term
   HELD context (or just context) is used as defined in
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Capabilities Exchange Overview

   Acquiring location measurements or information from a Device is made
   difficult by the nature of the relationship between the LIS, or
   access network, and the Device.  The relationship between a LIS and
   the Devices that it serves is often transient.  A Device is not
   necessarily a permanent part of an access network.

   HELD [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] provides a basis for
   the relationship between Device and LIS.  LIS Discovery
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery] provides a means for the Device to

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities               January 2010


   initiate the relationship.  The relationship is extended to include
   stateful information at the LIS in the form of a HELD context
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context].  This document builds HELD
   contexts by providing a means for the LIS to request information from
   the Device.

   This document describes how a HELD context can be used as the basis
   for cooperative location determination.  A Device provides the LIS
   with a capabilities indication when it creates or updates its context
   data.  The LIS responds with a capabilities agreement, that includes
   which of these capabilities it might use.

   In the process of serving requests to a location URI, a LIS might
   determine that certain Device capabilities could be useful or
   necessary in completing the request.  The LIS is able to invoke
   specific capabilities to request location information, location
   measurements, or any other information from the Device.

   Device capabilities include the ability to generate or acquire
   location information, or the ability to make observations about the
   mode of network attachment or environment.  For instance, a Device
   with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) hardware can determine
   its own position by taking a set of measurements and performing a
   calculation, or it can provide the GNSS measurement data.

   This document defines a set of capabilities that a Device can use to
   indicate that it is able to provide location measurements.  The form
   of location measurements is described in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements].  A Device is able to use
   these capabilities to indicate to the LIS the types of measurements
   that it can observe and the means by which the LIS can acquire these
   measurements when needed.  Figure 1 shows a logical overview of a
   simple scenario where the LIS uses a Device-provided measurement to
   service a request to a location URI.

   In practice, this scheme relies on HTTP polling to provide a channel
   for LIS communication.  This mechanism is described in more detail in
   Section 5.

   This document also defines a location capability, which indicates
   that the Device is able to determine its own location.  Guidelines
   for the definition of other capabilities are also included.

3.1.  Capabilities Exchange

   To indicate capabilities to a LIS, a Device sends a capability
   indication to the LIS in a HELD "createContext" request.  The
   capability indication includes a set of capabilities, each identified
   by a URI.  The LIS selects those capabilities that it might make use
   of and provides a capabilities agreement that includes the selected
   capabilities in a "contextResponse" message.

   Once a common set of capabilities are agreed upon, the LIS is able
   invoke these capabilities to generate location information.  This
   might be an ability to generate geodetic location information at the
   Device, or the Device might be able provide the LIS with location
   measurements.  Agreed capabilities and associated parameters can be
   stored in the HELD context for later use in serving requests.

   The LIS invokes capabilities as it is necessary to service requests
   to the HELD context.  For instance, capabilities might be used to
   respond to a location request made by a location recipient (LR) to
   one of the location URIs provided by the context.

             Figure 3: Invoking Capabilities (Logical Process)

   Capabilities are related to a single context.  The LIS MUST restrict
   its use of capabilities to requests relating to the context where the
   capabilities are provided by the Device.  The LIS MUST remove any
   pre-existing capabilities from a context when it receives a
   capabilities indication.  Therefore, a Device is able to remove
   specific capabilities from a context by providing a capabilities
   indication that omits that capability.  An empty capabilities

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities               January 2010


   indication removes all capabilities.

   A capabilities exchange may contain additional information that is
   specific to the associated measurement acquisition method.  This
   additional information allows the Device and LIS to provide more
   information about individual capabilities.  This information is
   stored along with the agreed capabilities in the HELD context.

4.  The Capability Indication

   A "capabilities" element is added to the create context or update
   context HELD requests.  The Device initiates the exchange, including
   the "capind" element in the request message.  The "capagree" element
   contain in the response from the LIS includes the set of capabilities
   that might be used.

   Both "capind" and "capagree" elements contain a set of capability
   indications.  A single capability is represented by a "cap" element.
   Each "cap" element has a mandatory "uri" attribute that contains a
   URI unique to the type of capability.  An "id" attribute identifies
   the individual capability within the context of an exchange; the
   value used by the LIS matches the corresponding indication by the
   Device.

   The "cap" element may also contain arbitrary content, which means
   that the element is able to carry supplementary information that is
   specific to the capability.  This supplementary information could
   include addressing information, protocol selection, authentication
   details, or any data necessary for the successful retrieval of
   information.  Different supplementary information can be provided by
   the Device and LIS.

   The optional "responseTime" attribute of the "cap" element indicates
   the expected time that invoking that particular capability takes.
   This parameter assists the LIS in deciding whether or not to invoke a
   capability when serving a request for location information.  The
   "responseTime" attribute is an integer value in milliseconds.  The
   "responseTime" attribute only appears in a capabilities indication.

      The Device is only able to quantify the time for its own
      involvement in the process; additional delays from polling,
      network transit and LIS processing need to be included in any
      decision to invoke a Device capability.

   Multiple capability indications are not necessary, since a set of
   capabilities can be specified in the same element.  A LIS MAY either
   select an arbitrary capability indication, or combine capabilities
   from multiple indications.

   The following figure shows a capabilities indication that might be
   made by a Device with GNSS capabilities.  This uses the location
   capability defined in Section 6, as well as a second capability that
   includes additional parameters.

     <capind xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap">
       <cap uri="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:location"
            id="cap-loc1" responseTime="45000"/>

           gnss:gnss
         </lm>
       </cap>
     </capind>

4.1.  Capability Definitions

   Capabilities can be defined for access network or location
   measurement technologies as required.  No special registration is
   required to define a capability; each capability is identified by a
   namespace URI.  A capability definition includes the following
   information:

   URI:  A capability is identified by a URI, which need only be unique
      and persistent.  Common practice is to use an "http:" URI for a
      domain that is under the author's control.  An IETF document MUST
      use a URN [RFC2141] that is registered with the IANA.

   Capability Parameters:  Each capability may require additional
      information to be passed between LIS and Device in order for it to
      be exercised.  This information must be described and defined as
      XML elements for inclusion in the "cap" element.  Separate
      descriptions and definitions SHOULD be provided for the Device to
      LIS indications and LIS to Device responses.

   Procedures for Invoking Capabilities:  Each capability MUST also
      include a description of how it can be exercised.  This includes
      the protocol that is used for any network exchanges, the impact of
      each parameter.  The HTTP polling mechanism described in Section 5
      SHOULD be used as the basis for any LIS-to-Device communication,
      but other mechanisms more appropriate to the capability might be
      used.

   Security and Privacy Implications:  A discussion of the security and
      the privacy implications associated with using the capability MUST
      be included with each definition.

   Author Contact:  Details on how to contact the individual or
      organization responsible for the capability definition.

5.  Capability Invocation

   This section describes the mechanism used for invoking the two Device
   capabilities defined in this document.  Capabilities defined
   elsewhere MAY use other mechanisms that are more suited to the
   capability.

   When agreeing upon a capability, the LIS indicates a resource that
   the Device is requested to monitor.  The contents of this resource
   identify the information that the LIS desires.  By monitoring this
   resource, the Device is informed when the LIS requires more
   information and the Device is then able to provide that information.

   The following capability agreement from a LIS indicates that in order
   to allow for invocation of the agreed capabilities, a Device needs to
   monitor a specific resource.  The same URI is provided for both
   capabilities in this instance, but different resources MAY be
   indicated.

     <capagree xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap">
       <cap uri="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:location"
                 id="cap-loc1">
         <poll>https://lis.example.com/cap/SEVMRCBpcyBncmVhdC4</poll>
       </cap>
       <cap uri="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:lm"
                 id="cap-gnss1">
         <poll>https://lis.example.com/cap/SEVMRCBpcyBncmVhdC4</poll>
         <lm xmlns:gnss="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lm:gnss">
           gnss:gnss
         </lm>
       </cap>
     </capagree>

5.1.  HTTP Polling

   The Device monitors this resource, using either HTTP long-polling
   [I-D.loreto-http-bidirectional] or periodic requests (short-polling).
   Both methods use the GET method in order to take advantage of HTTP
   intermediaries.

   If long-polling is used, the Device indicates this by including a
   conditional request header, such as "If-Modified-Since" or
   "If-None-Match" [[This doesn't completely work; additional indicators
   are needed here]].  An HTTP 200 response is sent immediately when the
   resource is updated.  In order to continue monitoring the state of

   the resource after receiving a response, the Device immediately sends
   another request.

   In the absence of the conditional HTTP headers, the server MAY assume
   that short-polling is in use.  If short-polling is used, the Device
   MUST NOT continuous poll for updates.  The server can limit the rate
   that a client is able to poll by sending a 503 (Service Unavailable)
   response with an appropriate "Retry-After" header.  A client that
   receives this header SHOULD adjust its polling rate to match the
   indicated period.

   The LIS updates this resource to indicate which capability it wishes
   to invoke and any conditions on the invocation.

5.2.  Invocation Resource

   The resource that the Device monitors contains instructions from the
   LIS.  The information contained by this resource is used to invoke
   one or more capabilities.

   The value of the invocation resource determines what information is
   required.  This document is an XML document with the MIME type of
   "application/held+xml" and a document element of "capinv".
   Initially, this document is likely to be empty (containing a single,
   empty "capinv" element).

   A change in the state of the invocation resource triggers the
   behaviour associated with a given capability.  The value of the
   invocation resource indicates the capability, and any actions that is
   desired.

   For instance, if the LIS wants to invoke the location capability of
   the Device, it updates the document to the following:

     <capinv xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap">
       <cap uri="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:location"
            capid="cap-loc1" before="2009-07-09T13:55:01+10:00">
         <target>https://lis.example.com/U2Nob29sIGlzIGNvb2wu</target>
       </cap>
     </capinv>

   HELD notes that a Device avoid using proxies due to the effect that
   they have in masking the actual source address of a request.
   However, HTTP intermediaries cannot be avoided, and provide some
   advantages; these include private caches operated on the Device and
   gateways that are deployed to provide load balancing.

   In order to avoid unwanted caching of the invocation document by HTTP

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities               January 2010


   intermediaries, a LIS SHOULD include the "no-cache" tag in a
   "Cache-Control" header of the response.  Intermediaries frequently
   might also time out a request; therefore, a LIS SHOULD limit the time
   that it holds a request open, responding with a 304 (Not Modified)
   response if the invocation document remains unchanged.

   The Device monitors the invocation resource as long as it is willing
   to respond to these requests.  Using this, an outstanding request
   from the LIS can be cancelled by removing capabilities from the
   invocation document; or updated by changing the capability details.
   Expiry of the HELD context, or removal of the invocation resource
   terminates any monitoring.  An HTTP 404 (Not Found) or 410 (Gone)
   response is sufficient indication to the Device that the resource no
   longer exists.

5.3.  Invocation Time

   The "before" attribute on the capability invocation serves to advise
   the Device on the latest time when a response is needed.  For the two
   capabilities defined in this document, this time is the latest moment
   that information from the Device is of use to the LIS.  If this time
   has passed, or the capability cannot be invoked before this time,
   then the capability invocation can be ignored.

   The "periodic" attribute on a capability establishes a requirement
   for periodic updates.  The attribute contains a time interval in
   milliseconds, which specifies the periodicity desired.  This
   indicates that the Device provide information before the time
   specified in the "before" attribute and periodically thereafter at
   the specified interval.  Periodic invocations continue until the
   invocation is modified or removed.

   For instance, the following invocation contains a request to provide
   Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements before
   "2009-07-09T13:55:01+10:00" and at 60 second intervals (before
   13:55:01, then before 13:56:01, then 13:57:01, and continuing
   indefinitely).

     <capinv xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap">
       <cap uri="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:lm"
            capid="cap-gnss1"

         <target>https://lis.example.com/TWVhc3VyZSBmaXJzdC4</target>
       </cap>
     </capinv>

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities               January 2010


5.4.  Responding to a Capability Invocation

   A Device that wishes to provide information MUST do so when it
   receives an invocation that it can comply with.  The information is
   pushed to the URI indicated in the "target" element as an HTTP PUT.
   The format of the information provided depends on the capability.

   Information provided in this manner can be considered as additional
   supplementary information added to the HELD context.  The same
   authorization rules that apply to the context apply to this data.  A
   LIS is able to redistribute this information and anything results
   based on this information under the same terms as the context
   operates.  This information MUST be removed when the context is
   removed.  Explicit data expiration indications, such as that used in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements], MUST be respected.

5.5.  Multiple Invocations

   The same invoke resource MAY be used for multiple capabilities.
   Devices that support multiple capabililties identify the capability
   that the LIS desires to use through the capability identification
   provided.  If multiple capabilities are invoked at the same time, the
   Device MAY choose to provide all information concurrently, or
   separately.  The Device MAY choose to provide some information, then
   only provide the additional information if the invoke resource
   continues to include a request for the additional information.

   The measurement capability inherently supports provision of multiple
   measurements concurrently.  A single measurement container can be
   provided with multiple different forms of measurement.  In
   comparison, the location capability does not provide this option.
   Unless specifically stated in the definition of a capability,
   responding to each invocation requires a separate HTTP request.

6.  The Location Capability

   The ability to locate itself is a trait that is applicable to Devices
   in a range of networks.  This includes automated location
   determination, like Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), user
   input, an alternative location service, or a range of location
   techniques.  Because the Device produces complete location
   information, there is no need for technology- or network-specific
   features in messages.  Therefore, this section describes how a Device
   may advertise its capability to source its own location.

   This section defines a location capability, identified by the URN
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:location".  This capability
   indicates that the Device is able to provide location information to

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities               January 2010


   the LIS.

   The location capability is invoked using the method described in
   Section 5.  A URI is provided by the LIS and the Device monitors this
   resource.  If the location capability is invoked, the Device provides
   location information, in the form of a PIDF-LO.  The Device uses an
   HTTP PUT to the target URI.  The PUT request includes a PIDF-LO
   document and a "Content-Type" of "application/pidf+xml".

   Only the "location-info" element of the PIDF-LO is used by the LIS;
   other PIDF-LO fields SHOULD be minimally populated.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the Device generate an unlinked pseudonym for the
   "entity" attribute of the presence document to avoid providing
   identity information.

   In providing location information in this manner, the Device
   implicitly grants the LIS the ability to redistribute location
   information under the same conditions that apply to the HELD context.

6.1.  Location Capability Summary

   The following summarizes the location capability following the
   outline from Section 4.1:

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:location

   Capability Parameters:  This capability indication includes no
      parameters; the capability agreement includes a URI that
      references an invocation document containing instructions for the
      Device.

   Procedures for Invoking Capabilities:  The Device monitors the
      invocation resource using HTTP polling.  If that document
      indicates this capability, an HTTP PUT is use to provide the LIS
      with information.

   Security and Privacy Implications:  See Section 10 of this document.

7.  Location Measurement Capability

   Measurement data from the Device can be invaluable in improving the
   quality of location information.  Measurement information from a
   Device can improve the accuracy of location estimates or enable
   positioning methods that would not otherwise be available.  See
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements] for more information on
   location measurements.  Providing access to measurement data by using

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities               January 2010


   the capability exchange makes these advantages available when a
   location recipient uses a location URI to retrieve location
   information.

   The measurement capability is identified by the URN
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:lm".  In addition to this
   URN, the Device also needs to indicate which measurements it can
   provide in the capability indication.  This is done by identifying
   the location measurement element.

   The "lm" element includes a qualified element name (using the
   namespace context of the enclosing document).  This element name
   identifies a measurement element, as defined by the guidelines in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements].

   Inclusion of the "lm" element is only necessary in a capabilities
   indication, it MAY be omitted from any capabilities agreement or
   capabilities invocation.

   When the LIS invokes this capability, the Device provides location
   measurements in the HTTP PUT to the specified URI.  This document
   contains the MIME type "application/xml" [[Ed: probably need to
   define new MIME type for this]] and has a document element of
   "measurements".  This document contains one or more measurement
   elements containing the requested measurement data.

   Multiple measurements can be provided at the same time.  The
   "measurements" element simply contains multiple measurement elements.
   This can be used to simultaneously provide information for multiple
   different invocations of this capability.

7.1.  Location Measurement Capability Summary

   The following summarizes the location measurement capability
   following the outline from Section 4.1:

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:lm

   Capability Parameters:  This capability includes a single "lm"
      element in all capability indicates that identifies the type of
      location measurement that can be provided.  This parameter is only
      used in the capabilities indication sent from Device to LIS.

      The capability agreement includes a URI that references an
      invocation document containing instructions for the Device.

9.  Example Capabilities Exchange and Invocation

   This section shows sample messages relating to the creation of a
   context with capabilities, monitoring the invocation resource and the
   provision of measurement or location information.  HTTP headers are
   shown on messages where it is relevant to do so.

   The following HELD request from a Device creates a context, including
   a capabilities indication:

     <createContext
         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:context">
       <lifetime>7200</lifetime>
       <snapshot>false</snapshot>

       <capind xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap">
         <cap uri="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:location"
              id="cap-loc1" responseTime="45000"/>
         <cap uri="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:lm"
              id="cap-gnss1" responseTime="30000">
           <lm xmlns:gnss="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:lm:gnss">
             gnss:gnss
           </lm>
         </cap>
       </capind>
     </createContext>

   Two capabilities are included: location and measurement.  The
   measurement capability indicates that GNSS measurements can be
   provided by the Device.

   The LIS response includes context details, along with a capabilities
   agreement:

   <contextResponse code="created"
                    xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:context">
     <context id="uhvuhdbnuiehudbnvcujevuijeijcvij4"

           https://lis.example.com:9768/357yc6s64ceyoiuy5ax3o4
         </locationURI>
       </locationUriSet>
     </context>

     <capagree xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap">
       <cap uri="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:location"
            id="cap-loc1">
         <poll>https://lis.example.com/cap/SEVMRCBpcyBncmVhdC4</poll>
       </cap>
       <cap uri="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:lm"
            id="cap-gnss1">
         <poll>https://lis.example.com/cap/SEVMRCBpcyBncmVhdC4</poll>
       </cap>
     </capagree>
   </contextResponse>

   This indication instructs the Device to monitor the same URI to
   determine when the LIS wants to invoke either capability.

   The Device then monitors the state of the resource: [[ TODO: Add
   long-polling-specific headers.]]

   GET /cap/SEVMRCBpcyBncmVhdC4 HTTP/1.1
   Host: lis.example.com

   Some time later, the LIS receives a location request and decides that
   the GNSS measurement capability of the Device would be useful or
   necessary in completing the reqeust.  The LIS updates the invocation
   resource with instructions to the Device to provide location
   measurements:

   The Device decides that it is able to provide these data.  It takes

   The LIS immediately provides an empty response to the Device:

   HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
   Server: Example LIS
   Date: Fri, 10 Jul 2009 05:08:08 GMT


   The LIS is then able to use the provided measurement data to provide
   highly accurate location information in response to the request it
   received.

10.  Security Considerations

   The information provided by a Device in the course of responding to a
   capabilities invocation could be private data.  This information
   might grant the LIS the ability to locate the Device with greater
   accuracy than would be otherwise possible.  Furthermore, information

Internet-Draft              HELD Capabilities               January 2010


   about the capabilities of a Device could also be considered
   sensitive.  A Device SHOULD offer a user the option to suppress some
   or all capabilities.

   Capabilities MUST only be exchanged with the LIS in the scope of a
   context.  This precaution provides the Device with a means to cancel
   access to these capabilities at any time.  This can be done by
   deleting the context, or by indicating an empty set of capabilities
   to the LIS.

   Any information that is provided to the LIS by the Device increases
   the impact of LIS impersonation.  Measures that mitigate the
   possibility of impersonation, as outlined in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery], are more important for a Device
   that provides capability information to a LIS.  Protocols used for
   the exchange of location information or location measurements MUST
   also provide protection from eavesdropping.

   Responding to a capabilities invocation might require significant
   investment of time and resources by a Device.  Even the process of
   monitoring the invocation resource requires non-trivial effort, with
   little initial investment.  This could be exploited by a malicious
   LIS to exhaust batteries or perform other denial of service attacks.
   A Device SHOULD limit the resources it makes available to a LIS in
   relation to capabilities it advertises.

   The LIS is responsible for the veracity of location information it
   provides, even when it relies on information that comes from the
   Device.  This and other considerations described in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements] apply to the use of Device-
   provided information.

   Server authentication for all stages of the process are important,
   not only for the HELD "createContext" request, but also for
   retrieving the capabilities invocation and publishing the requested
   information.  These resources do no need to be provided by the same
   server, but each resource MUST be authenticated based on the domain
   name in the URI, if possible.  HTTP over TLS [RFC2818] is strongly
   RECOMMENDED for each of these exchanges.

10.1.  URI Secrecy

   Using capabilities offers attackers a means to provide invalid
   location or measurement data.  The URI offered by the LIS for
   receiving location or measurement data is not authorized.  If an
   attacker knows this URI, they are able to provide misleading
   information that could be used by the LIS.

   The only protection provided is secrecy.  Only the Device is given
   the URI to the invocation resource, which is where the URI used for
   providing information is made available.  To guarantee this secrecy,
   the URI of the invocation resource and any URIs contained therein
   need to be difficult to acquire or guess.

   The LIS MUST use confidentiality protection on the channel it uses to
   provide these two resources.  HTTP over TLS [RFC2818] MUST be used
   unless confidentiality can be guaranteed by other means.

   To make guessing more difficult, these URIs MUST include sufficient
   randomness.  The LIS SHOULD also periodically change the URIs it
   provides to limit any exposure in the case that these URIs become
   known to an attacker.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This section registers a URN for a capabilities XML namespace
   (Section 11.1) and a corresponding schema (Section 11.4).  URNs are
   registered for the location (Section 11.2) and location measurement
   (Section 11.3) capabilities.
