Abstract

   The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF has proposed an architecture for
   controlling media services.  The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is
   used as the signalling protocol which provides many inherent
   capabilities for message routing.  In addition to such signalling
   properties, a need exists for intelligent, application level media
   service selection based on non-static signalling properties.  This is
   especially true when considered in conjunction with deployment
   architectures that include 1:M and M:N combinations of Application
   Servers and Media Servers.  This document introduces a Media Resource
   Broker (MRB) entity which manages the availability of Media Servers
   and the media resource demands of Application Servers.  The document
   includes potential deployment options for an MRB and appropriate
   interfaces to Application Servers and Media Servers.

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering              April 2011


1.  Introduction

   The topic of Media Resource management has been in discussion for a
   number of years with varying proprietary solutions being used today.
   It is clear that, as we move towards a consistent architecture and
   protocol for Media Server Control, a standard mechanism is required
   for accurate media resource selection.

   As IP based multimedia infrastructures mature, the complexity and
   demands from deployments increase.  Such complexity will result in a
   wide variety of capabilities from a range of vendors that should all
   be interoperable using the architecture and protocols produced by the
   MediaCtrl work group.  It should be possible for a controlling entity
   to be assisted in Media Server selection so that the most appropriate
   resource is selected for a particular operation.  The importance
   increases when you introduce a flexible level of deployment
   scenarios, as specified in the RFC 5167 [RFC5167] and RFC 5567
   [RFC5567] documents.  These documents make statements like "it should
   be possible to have a many-to-many relationship between Application
   Servers and Media Servers that use this protocol".  This leads to the
   following deployment architectures being possible when considering
   media resources.

   The simplest deployment view is illustrated in Figure 1.



   +---+-----+---+                         +---+-----+---+
   | Application |                         |    Media    |
   |   Server    |<-------MS Control------>|    Server   |
   +-------------+                         +-------------+



                       Figure 1: Basic Architecture

   This simply involves a single Application Server and Media Server.
   Expanding on this view, it is also possible for an Application Server
   to control multiple (greater that 1) Media Server instances at any
   one time.  This deployment view is illustrated in Figure 2.
   Typically, such architectures are associated with application logic
   that requires high demand media services.  It is more than possible
   that each media server possesses a different media capability set.
   Media servers may offer different media services as specified in the
   Mediactrl architecture document.  A Media server may have similar
   media functionality but may have different capacity or media codec
   support.

                                    |      +---+-----+---+
                                    +----->|    Media    |
                                           |    Server   |
                                           +-------------+


                     Figure 2: Multiple Media Servers

   Figure 3 conveys the opposite view to that in Figure 2.  In this
   model there are a number of (greater than 1) application servers,
   possibly supporting dissimilar applications, controlling a single
   media server.  Typically, such architectures are associated with
   application logic that requires low demand media services.

                  Figure 3: Multiple Application Servers

   The final deployment view is the most complex.  In this model (M:N)
   there exists any number of Application Servers and any number of
   Media Servers.  It is again possible in this model that media servers
   might not be homogenous and have different capability sets and

   The high level deployment options discussed in this section rely on
   network architecture and policy to prohibit inappropriate use.  Such
   policies are out of the scope of this document.

   This document will take a look at the specific problem areas related
   to such deployment architectures.  It is recognised that the
   solutions proposed in this document should be equally adaptable to
   all of the previously described deployment models.  It is also
   recognised that the solution is far more relevant to some of the
   previously discussed deployment models and can almost be viewed as
   redundant on others.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   In this document, BCP 14/RFC 2119 [RFC2119] defines the key words
   "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL".

   This document inherits terminology proposed in RFC 5567 [RFC5567] and
   Media Control Channel Framework
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] documents.  In addition,
   the following terms are defined for use in this document and for use
   in the context of the MediaCtrl Work group in the IETF:

   Media Resource Broker (MRB):   A logical entity that is responsible
      for both collection of appropriate published Media Server (MS)
      information and selecting appropriate MS resources on behalf of
      consuming entities.

   Query MRB:   An instantiation of an MRB (See previous definition)
      that provides an interface for an Application Server to retrieve
      the address of an appropriate Media Server.  The result returned
      to the Application Server can be influenced by information
      contained in the query request.

   In-line MRB:   An instantiation of an MRB (See definition) that
      directly receives requests on the signalling path.  There is no
      separate query.

   Within the context of In-line MRBs, additional terms are defined:

   In-line Aware MRB Mode (IAMM):   Defined in Section 5.2.2.1.

   In-line Unaware MRB Mode (IUMM):   Defined in Section 5.3.

   The document will often specify when a specific identifier in a
   protocol message needs to be unique.  Unless differently stated, such
   uniqueness will always need to be intended within the scope of the
   Media Servers controlled by the same Media Resource Broker.  The
   interaction among different Media Resource Brokers, as the
   partitioning of a logical Media Resource Broker, is out of scope to
   this document.

3.  Problem Discussion

   As anticipated in Section 1, the main aim of the MediaCtrl group is
   to produce a solution that must service a wide variety of deployment
   architectures.  These range from the simplest 1:1 relationship
   between Media Servers and Application Servers to potentially linearly
   scaling 1:M, M:1 and M:N deployments.

   This still does not seem like a major issue for the proposed solution
   until you add a number of additional factors into the equation that
   increase complexity.  As Media Servers evolve it must be taken into
   consideration that, where many can exist in a deployment, they may
   not have been produced by the same vendor and may not have the same
   capability set.  It should be possible for an Application Server that
   exists in a deployment to select a Media Service based on a common,
   appropriate capability set.  In conjunction with capabilities, it is
   also important to take available resources into consideration.  The
   ability to select an appropriate Media Service function is an
   extremely useful feature but becomes even more powerful when
   considered with available resources for servicing a request.

   In conclusion, the intention is to create a tool set that allows
   MediaCtrl deployments to effectively utilize the available media
   resources.  It should be noted that in the simplest deployments where
   only a single media server exists, an MRB function is probably not
   required.  Only a single capability set exists and resource
   unavailability can be handled using the appropriate underlying
   signalling, e.g., SIP response.  This document does not prohibit such
   uses of an MRB, it simply provides the tools for various entities to
   interact where appropriate.  It is also worth noting that the tools
   provided in this document aim to provide a 'best effort' view of
   media resources at the time of request for initial Media Server
   routing decisions.  Any dramatic change in media capabilities after a
   request has taken place should be handled by the underlying protocol.

   Please note that there may be additional information that it is
   desirable for the MRB to have for purposes of selecting an MS
   resource, such as resource allocation rules across different
   applications, planned or unplanned downtime of Media Server
   resources, the planned addition of future Media Server resources, or
   MS resource capacity models.  How the MRB acquires such information
   is outside the scope of this document.  The techniques used for
   selecting an appropriate Media Resource by an MRB is outside the
   scope of this document.

4.  Deployment Scenario Options

   On researching Media Resource Brokering it became clear that a couple
   of high level models exist.  The general principles of "in-line" and
   "query" MRB concepts are discussed in the rest of this section.

4.1.  Query MRB

   The "Query" model for MRB interactions provides the ability for a
   client of media services (for example an Application Server) to "ask"
   an MRB for an appropriate Media Server, as illustrated in Figure 5.

                            Figure 5: Query MRB

   In this deployment, the Media Servers use the "Media Server Resource
   Publish Interface", as discussed in Section 5.1, to convey capability
   sets as well as resource information.  This is depicted by (1) in
   Figure 5.  It is then the MRB's responsibility to accumulate all
   appropriate information relating to media services in the logical
   deployment cluster.  The Application Server (or other media services
   client) is then able to query the MRB for an appropriate resource (as
   identified by (2) in Figure 5).  Such a query would carry specific
   information related to the Media Service required and enable the MRB
   to provide an increased accuracy in its response.  This particular
   interface is discussed in "Media Resource Consumer Interface" in
   Section 5.2.  The Application Server is then able to direct control
   commands (for example create conference) and Media Dialogs to the

   appropriate Media Server, as shown by (3) in Figure 5.  Additionally,
   with Query MRB, the MRB is not in the signaling path between the AS
   and the selected MS resource.

4.1.1.  Hybrid Query MRB

   As mentioned previously, it is the intention that a tool kit is
   provided for MRB functionality within a MediaCtrl architecture.  It
   is expected that in specific deployment scenarios the role of the MRB
   might be co-hosted as a hybrid logical entity with an Application
   Server, as shown in Figure 6.

   This diagram is identical to that in Figure 5 with the exception that
   the MRB is now hosted on the Application Server.  The "Media Server
   Publish Interface" is still being used to accumulate resource
   information at the MRB but as it is co-hosted on the Application
   Server, the "Media Server Consumer Interface" has collapsed.  It
   might still exist within the Application Server/MRB interaction but
   this is an implementation issue.  This type of deployment suits a
   single Application Server environment but it should be noted that a
   "Media Server Consumer Interface" could then be offered from the
   hybrid if required.

   In a similar manner, the Media Server could also act as a hybrid for
   the deployment cluster, as illustrated in Figure 7.

                  Figure 7: Hybrid Query MRB - MS Hosted

   This time the MRB has collapsed and is co-hosted by the Media Server.
   The "Media Server Consumer Interface" is still available to the
   Application Servers (1) to query Media Server resources.  This time
   the "Media Server Publish Interface" has collapsed onto the Media
   Server.  It might still exist within the Media Server/MRB interaction
   but this is an implementation issue.  This type of deployment suits a
   single Media Server environment but it should be noted that a "Media
   Server Publish Interface" could then be offered from the hybrid if
   required.  A typical use case scenario for such a topology would be a
   single MS representing a pool of MSs in a cluster.  In that case, the
   MRB would actually be handling a cluster of MSs, rather than one.

4.2.  In-Line MRB

   The "In-line" MRB is architecturally different from the "Query" model
   that was discussed in the previous section.  The concept of a
   separate query disappears.  The client of the MRB simply uses the
   media resource control and media dialog signalling to involve the
   MRB.  This type of deployment is illustrated in Figure 8.

   The Media Servers still use the 'Media Server Publish Interface' to
   convey capabilities and resources to the MRB - as illustrated by (1).
   The media server Control (and Media dialogs as well, if required) is
   sent to the MRB (2) which then selects an appropriate Media Server
   (3) and would stay in the signaling path between the AS and the MS
   resource for the handled dialogs.

   In-line MRB can be split into two distinct logical roles which can be
   applied on a per request basis.  They are:

   In-line Unaware MRB Mode (IUMM):  Allows an MRB to act on behalf of
      clients requiring media services who are not aware of an MRB or
      its operation.  In this case the AS does not provide explicit
      information on the kind of MS resource it needs (as in
      Section 5.2) and the MRB is left to deduce it by potentially
      inspecting other information in the request from the AS; for
      example, SDP content, or address of the requesting AS, or
      additional Request-URI parameters as per RFC 4240 [RFC4240].

   In-line Aware MRB Mode (IAMM):  Allows an MRB to act on behalf of
      clients requiring media services who are aware of an MRB and its
      operation.  In particular it allows the AS to explicitly the
      convey the same kinds of MS characteristics desired as does the
      Query MRB mode (as in Section 5.2).

   In either role, the MRB would deduce that the selected MS resources
   are no longer needed when the AS or MS terminates the corresponding

   dialog.  The two modes are discussed in more detail in Section 5.3.

5.  MRB Interface Definitions

   As discussed in previous sections in this document, the intention is
   to provide a toolkit for a variety of deployment architectures where
   media resource brokering can take place.  As a result, two main
   interfaces are required to support the differing requirements.  The
   two interfaces are described in the remainder of this section and
   have been named the 'Media Server Resource Publish' and 'Media Server
   Resource Consumer' interfaces.  These two interfaces have extremely
   differing responsibilities and usages which is reflected in the
   choice of solutions.

   It is beyond the scope of this document to define exactly how to
   construct an MRB.  This includes interpreting the data for the Media
   Service Consumer interface supplied by the Media Server Publish
   interface.  It is, however, important that the two interfaces are
   complimentary so that development of appropriate MRB functionality is
   supported.

5.1.  Media Server Resource Publish Interface

   The Media Server Resource Publish interface is responsible for
   providing an MRB with appropriate Media Server resource information.
   As such, this interface is assumed to provide both general and
   specific details related to Media Server resources.  This information
   needs to be conveyed using an industry standard mechanism to provide
   increased levels of adoption and interoperability.  A Control Package
   for the Media Control Channel Framework will be specified to fulfil
   this interface requirement.  It provides an establishment and
   monitoring mechanism to enable a Media Server to report appropriate
   statistics to an MRB.  The Publish interface is used with both Query
   and In-line modes of MRB operation.

   As already anticipated in the introduction, the MRB view of MS
   resource availability will in practice be approximate - i.e., partial
   and imperfect.  The MRB Publish interface does not provide an
   exhaustive view of current MS resource consumption, the MS may in
   some cases provide a best-effort computed view of resource
   consumption parameters conveyed in the Publish interface (e.g., DSP's
   with a fixed number of streams versus GPU's with CPU availability),
   there may be licensing constraints not factored in (e.g., even if
   lots of CPU and memory are available, licensing or other
   configuration elements may restrict the number of stream types), and
   MS resource information may only be reported periodically over the
   Publish interface to MRB.  Nevertheless, despite such limitations it
   is assumed that the provided information is enough to allow MRB
   implementors to realize its functionality.




Boulton, et al.         Expires October 15, 2011               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering              April 2011


   It is also worth noting that, while the scope of the MRB is
   definitely on providing interested Application Servers with the
   available resources, the MRB also allows for the retrieval of
   information about the currently occupied resources.  While this is of
   course a relevant piece of information (e.g., for monitoring
   purposes), such a functionality inevitably raises security
   considerations, and implementations should take this into account.
   See Section 12 for more details.

   The MRB Publish interface uses the Media Control Channel Framework
   ([I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework]) as the basis for
   interaction between a Media Server and an MRB.  The Media Control
   Channel Framework uses an extension mechanism to allow specific
   usages which are known as control packages.  Section 5.1.1 defines
   the control package that MUST be implemented by any Media Server
   wanting to interact with an MRB entity.

   Please note that it is out of scope how an MRB knows what MSs should
   be queried for publishing information.

5.1.1.  Control Package Definition

   This section fulfills the mandatory requirement for information that
   must be specified during the definition of a Control Framework
   Package, as detailed in Section 8 of
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework].

5.1.1.1.  Control Package Name

   The Media Channel Control Framework requires a Control Package
   definition to specify and register a unique name and version.

   The name and version of this Control Package is "mrb-publish/1.0".

5.1.1.2.  Framework Message Usage

   The MRB publish interface allows a media server to convey available
   capabilities and resources to an MRB entity.

   This package defines XML elements in Section 5.1.2 and provides an
   XML Schema in Section 10.

   The XML elements in this package are split into requests, responses
   and event notifications.  Requests are carried in CONTROL message
   bodies; <mrbrequest> element is defined as a package request.  This
   request can be used for creating new subscriptions and updating/
   removing existing subscriptions.  Event notifications are also
   carried in CONTROL message bodies; the <mrbnotification> element is



Boulton, et al.         Expires October 15, 2011               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering              April 2011


   defined for package event notifications.  Responses are carried
   either in REPORT message or Control Framework 200 response bodies;
   the <mrbresponse> element is defined as a package level response.

   Note that package responses are different from framework response
   codes.  Framework error response codes (see Section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework]) are used when the request
   or event notification is invalid; for example, a request has invalid
   XML (400), or is not understood (500).  Package level responses are
   carried in framework 200 response or REPORT message bodies.  This
   package's response codes are defined in Section 5.1.5.

5.1.1.3.  Common XML Support

   The Media Control Channel Framework
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] requires a Control Package
   definition to specify if the attributes for media dialog or
   conference references are required.

   The Publish interface defined in Section 10 does import and make use
   of the common XML schema defined in the Media Control Channel
   Framework.

   The Consumer interface defined in Section 11 does import and make use
   of the common XML schema defined in the Media Control Channel
   Framework.

5.1.1.4.  CONTROL Message Body

   A valid CONTROL body message MUST conform to the schema defined in
   Section 10 and described in Section 5.1.2.  XML messages appearing in
   CONTROL messages MUST contain either a <mrbrequest> or
   <mrbnotification> element.

5.1.1.5.  REPORT Message Body

   A valid REPORT body MUST conform to the schema defined in Section 10
   and described in Section 5.1.2.  XML messages appearing in REPORT
   messages MUST contain a <mrbresponse> element.

5.1.1.6.  Audit

   The 'mrb-publish/1.0' Media Control Channel Framework package does
   not require any additional auditing capability.

5.1.2.  Element Definitions

   This section defines the XML elements for the Publish interface Media
   Control Channel package defined in Section 5.1.  The formal XML
   schema definition for the Publish interface can be found in
   Section 10.

   The root element is <mrbpublish>.  All other XML elements (requests,
   responses, notifications) are contained within it.  The MRB Publish
   interface request element is detailed in Section 5.1.3.  The MRB
   Publish interface notification element is detailed in Section 5.1.4.
   MRB Publish interface response element is contained in Section 5.1.5.

   The <mrbpublish> element has the following attributes:

   version:  a token specifying the mrb-publish package version.  The
      value is fixed as '1.0' for this version of the package.  The
      attribute MUST be present.

   The <mrbpublish> element has the following child element, only one of
   which is allowed to occur in a request.

      <mrbrequest> for sending an MRB request.  See Section 5.1.3.

      <mrbresponse> for sending an MRB response.  See Section 5.1.5.

      <mrbnotification> for sending an MRB notification.  See
      Section 5.1.4.

5.1.3.  <mrbrequest>

   This section defines the <mrbrequest> element used to initiate
   requests from an MRB to a Media Server.  The element is a container
   for information relevant for the interrogation of a media server.

   The <mrbrequest> element has no defined attributes.

   The <mrbrequest> element has the following sub-elements which are
   defined in the remainder of this section:

      <subscription> for initiating a subscription to a Media Server
      from an MRB.  See Section 5.1.3.1.

5.1.3.1.  <subscription>

   The <subscription> element is included in a request from an MRB to a
   Media Server to provide the details relating to the configuration of
   updates.  This element can be used either to request a new



Boulton, et al.         Expires October 15, 2011               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering              April 2011


   subscription or to update an existing one (e.g., to change the
   frequency of the updates), and to remove ongoing subscriptions as
   well (e.g., to stop an indefinite update).  The MRB will inform the
   Media Server how long it wishes to receive updates for and the
   frequency that updates should be sent.  Updates related to the
   subscription are sent using the <mrbnotification> element.

   The <subscription> element has the following attributes:

   id:  indicates a unique token representing the subscription session
      between the MRB and the Media Server.  The attribute MUST be
      present.

   seqnumber:  indicates a sequence number to be used in conjunction
      with the subscrition session id to identify a specific
      subscription command.  The first subscription MUST have 1 as
      'seqnumber', and following subscriptions MUST increment by 1 the
      previous 'seqnumber' value.  The attribute MUST be present.

   action:  provides the operation that should be carried out on the
      subscription:

      *  The value of 'create' instructs the MS to attempt to setup a
         new subscription.

      *  The value of 'update' instructs the MS to attempt to update an
         existing subscription.

      *  The value of 'remove' instructs the MS to attempt to remove an
         existing subscription and consequently stop any ongoing related
         notification.

      The attribute MUST be present.

   The <subscription> element has the following child elements:

   expires:   Provides the amount of time in seconds that a subscription
      should be installed for notifications at the Media Server.  Once
      the amount of time has passed, the subscription expires and the
      MRB has to subscribe again in case it is still interested in
      receiving notifications from the MS.  The element MAY be present.

   frequency:   Provides the frequency in seconds that the MRB wishes to
      receive notifications from the MS.  The element MAY be present.

   Please note that these two optional pieces of information provided by
   the MRB only act as a suggestion: the MS MAY change the proposed
   values if it considers the suggestions unacceptable (e.g., if the MRB

   has requested a too high notification frequency).  In such case, the
   request would not fail, but the updated, acceptable values would be
   reported in the <mrbresponse> accordingly.

5.1.4.  <mrbnotification>

   The <mrbnotification> element is included in a request from a Media
   Server to an MRB to provide the details relating current status.  The
   Media Server will inform the MRB of its current status as defined by
   the information in the <subscription> element.  Updates are sent

                    Table 1: <mrbresponse> status codes

   In case a new subscription request made by an MRB (action='create')
   has been accepted, the MS MUST reply with a <mrbresponse> with status
   code 200.  The same rule applies whenever a request to update
   (action='update') or remove (action='remove') an existing transaction
   can be fulfilled by the MS.

   A subscription request, nevertheless, may fail for several reasons.
   In such a case, the status codes defined in Table 1 must be used
   instead.  Specifically, if the MS fails to handle a request due to a
   syntax error in the request itself (e.g., incorrect XML, violation of
   the schema constraints or invalid values in any of the attributes/
   elements) the MS MUST reply with a <mrbresponse> with status code
   400.  If a syntactically correct request fails because the request
   also includes any attribute/element the MS doesn't understand, the MS
   MUST reply with a <mrbresponse> with status code 420.  If a
   syntactically correct request fails because the MRB wants to create a
   new subscription, but the provided intended id for the subscription
   already exists, the MS MUST reply with a <mrbresponse> with status

   code 405.  If a syntactically correct request fails because the MRB
   wants to update/remove a subscription that doesn't exist, the MS MUST
   reply with a <mrbresponse> with status code 404.  If the MS is unable
   to accept a request for any other reason (e.g., the MRB has no more
   resources to fulfil the request), the MS MUST reply with a
   <mrbresponse> with status code 401/402/403, depending on the action
   the MRB provided in its request:

   o  action='create' --> 401;

   o  action='update' --> 402;

   o  action='remove' --> 403;

   As explained in Section 5.1.3.1, even in case of an accepted
   subscription request the MS might change the suggested 'expires' and
   'frequency' values provided by the MRB in its <mrbrequest>, if it
   considers them unacceptable (e.g., the requested frequency is too
   high).  In such a case, the MS MUST add an additional <subscription>
   element to the response, including the updated values, to inform the
   MRB about the change.  The MS MAY include such element if the values
   have been accepted or were omitted in the request.

5.2.  Media Service Resource Consumer Interface

   The Media Server Consumer interface provides the ability for clients
   of an MRB, such as Application Servers, to request an appropriate
   Media Server to satisfy specific criteria.  The interface allows a
   client to pass detailed meta-information to the MRB to help select an
   appropriate Media Server.  The MRB is then able to make an informed
   decision and provide the client with an appropriate media server
   resource.  The MRB Consumer interface includes both 1) In-Line Aware
   MRB Mode (IAMM) that uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and
   2) Query mode that uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   [RFC2616].  The MRB Consumer interface does not include In-Line
   Unaware Mode (IUMM) which is further explained in Section 5.3.  The
   following subsections provide guidance on using the Consumer
   interface, as defined by the 'application/mrb-consumer+xml MIME type
   in Section 11, with HTTP and SIP.

5.2.1.  Query Mode / HTTP Consumer Interface Usage

   An appropriate interface for such a 'query' style interface is in
   fact a HTTP usage.  Using HTTP and XML combined reduces complexity
   and encourages use of common tools that are widely available in the
   industry today.  The following information explains the primary
   operations required to request and then receive information from an
   MRB.  The following description will describe the use of HTTP

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering              April 2011


   [RFC2616] and HTTPS [RFC2818] as transport for a query for media
   resource and the appropriate response.

   The media resource query, as defined by the <mediaResourceRequest>
   element from Section 11, MUST be carried in the body of an HTTP/HTTPS
   POST request.  The MIME type contained in the HTTP/HTTPS request/
   response MUST be 'application/mrb-consumer+xml'.  This value MUST be
   reflected in the appropriate HTTP headers like 'Content-Type' and
   'Accept'.  The body of the HTTP/HTTPS POST request MUST only contain
   the 'mediaResourceRequest' element as defined in Section 11.  The
   'mediaResourceRequest' element is the primary container of
   information related to a media resource request.

   The media resource response to a query, as defined by the
   <mediaResourceResponse> element from Section 11, MUST be carried in
   the body of an HTTP/HTTPS 200 response to the original HTTP/HTTPS
   POST request.  The MIME type contained in the HTTP/HTTPS request/
   response MUST be 'application/mrb-consumer+xml'.  This value MUST be
   reflected in the appropriate HTTP headers like 'Content-Type' and
   'Accept'.  The body of the HTTP/HTTPS 200 response MUST only contain
   the 'mediaResourceResponse' element as defined in Section 11.  The
   'mediaResourceResponse' element is the primary container of
   information related to a media resource response.

   When an application server wants to release previously awarded media
   resources granted through a prior request/response exchange with MRB,
   it will send a new request with an <action> element with value
   'remove' as described in Section Section 5.2.3 about the use of the
   Consumer interface lease mechanism.

5.2.2.  In-Line Aware Mode / SIP Consumer Interface Usage

   This document provides a complete toolkit for MRB deployment which
   includes the ability to interact with an MRB using SIP for the
   Consumer interface.  The following information explains the primary
   operations required to request and then receive information from an
   MRB.  The following description will describe the use of SIP
   [RFC3261] as transport for a request for media resources and the
   appropriate response when used with IAMM of operation (as discussed
   in Section 5.2.2.1).

   Use of IAMM, besides having the MRB select an appropriate media
   resource on behalf of a client application, includes setting up
   either a Control Framework control channel between an application
   server and media server (Section 5.2.2.1) or a call leg media session
   between an application server and a media server (Section 5.2.2.2).
   Note that in either case the SIP address of the selected media server
   is made known to the requesting application server in the SIP 200 OK



Boulton, et al.         Expires October 15, 2011               [Page 31]

   response as the media-server-address element in the <response-
   session-info> element (Section 5.2.5).

5.2.2.1.  IAMM and Setting up a Control Framework Control Channel

   The media resource request information, as defined by the
   <mediaResourceRequest> element from Section 11, MUST be carried in a
   SIP INVITE request.  The INVITE request will be constructed as it
   would have been to connect to a media server, as defined by the Media
   Control Channel Framework [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework].
   The following additional steps MUST be followed when using the
   Consumer interface:

   o  Include a payload in the SIP INVITE request of type 'multipart/
      mixed'[RFC2046].  One of the parts to be included in the
      'multipart/mixed' payload MUST be the 'application/sdp' format
      which is constructed as specified in the Media Control Channel
      Framework [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework].

   o  Another part of the 'multipart/mixed' payload MUST be of type
      'application/mrb-consumer+xml', as specified in this document and
      defined in Section 11.  Only the <mediaResourceRequest> and its
      child elements can be included in the payload.

   o  The INVITE request will then be dispatched to the MRB, as defined
      by [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework].

   On receiving a SIP INVITE request containing the multipart mixed
   payload as specified previously, the MRB will complete a number of
   steps to fulfill the request.  It will:

   o  Extract the multipart MIME payload from the SIP INVITE request.
      It will then use the contextual information provided by the client
      in the 'application/mrb-consumer+xml' part to determine which
      media server should be selected to service the request.

   o  Extract the 'application/sdp' part from the payload and use it to
      populate a new SIP INVITE request for connecting the client to the
      selected media server, as defined in the Media Channel Control
      Framework [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework].

   The MRB acts as a Back-to-Back-UA (B2BUA) that extracts the
   'application/mrb-consumer+xml' information from the SIP INVITE
   request and then sends a corresponding SIP INVITE request to the
   selected Media Server.

   Once the MRB receives the SIP response from the selected media
   resource (i.e., media server), it will in turn respond to the



Boulton, et al.         Expires October 15, 2011               [Page 32]

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering              April 2011


   requesting client (i.e., application server).

   The media resource response by MRB to a request, as defined by the
   <mediaResourceResponse> element from Section 11, MUST be carried in
   the payload of a SIP 2xx class response to the original SIP INVITE
   request.  The 2xx class response will be constructed as it would have
   been to connect from a media server, as defined by the Media Control
   Channel Framework [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework].  The
   following additional steps MUST be followed when using the Consumer
   interface:

   o  Include a payload in the SIP 2xx class response of type
      'multipart/mixed' as perRFC 2046 [RFC2046].  One of the parts to
      be included in the 'multipart/mixed' payload MUST be the
      'application/sdp' format which is constructed as specified in the
      Media Control Channel Framework
      [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework].

   o  Another part of the 'multipart/mixed' payload MUST be of type
      'application/mrb-consumer+xml', as specified in this document and
      defined in Section 11.  Only the <mediaResourceResponse> and its
      child elements can be included in the payload.

   o  The SIP 2xx class response will then be dispatched from the MRB.

   o  A SIP ACK to the 2xx class response will then be sent back to the
      MRB.

   An MRB implementation may be programmed to conclude that the
   requested resources are no longer needed when it receives a SIP BYE
   from the application server or media server that concludes the SIP
   dialog that initiated the request, or when the lease interval
   expires.

5.2.2.2.  IAMM and Setting up a Call Leg

   This scenario is identical to the description in the prior section
   for setting up a Control Framework control channel, except for the
   difference that the application/sdp payload conveys content
   appropriate for setting up the call leg to the media resource, as per
   RFC 3261 [RFC2046], instead of application/sdp payload for setting up
   a control channel.

5.2.3.  Consumer Interface Lease Mechanism

   The Consumer interface defined in Section 5.2 and Section 11 allows a
   client to request an appropriate media resource based on information
   included in the request (either a HTTP POST or SIP INVITE message).



Boulton, et al.         Expires October 15, 2011               [Page 33]

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering              April 2011


   In case of success, the response that is returned to the client MUST
   contain a <session-info> element in either the SIP 2xx class or HTTP
   200 response.  The information contained in the <response-session-
   info> element allows a Consumer client to monitor the life time of
   the resources it has successfully requested, as well as amending
   them.

   Before delving into the details of such lease mechanism, though, it's
   worthwhile to first clarify its role within the context of the
   Consumer interface.  As explained in Section 5.1, the knowledge the
   MRB has of the resources of all the MS it handles is imperfect.  As
   such, how an MRB actually manages such resources depends on how it is
   implemented: one may choose to have the MRB keeping track and state
   of the allocated resources, or simply depend on the MS themselves to
   provide the information by means of the publishing interface
   notifications.  Further information may be inferred by the
   signalling, in case the MRB is in the path of call legs.

   That said, the <mediaResourceResponse> element returned from the MRB
   contains a <response-session-info> element if the request is
   successful.  The <response-session-info> element has the following
   child elements which provide the appropriate resource session
   information:

   o  <session-id> is a unique identifier that enables a Consumer client
      and MRB to correlate future media resource requests related to an
      initial media resource request.  The <session-id> MUST be included
      in all future related requests (see <session-id> use later in this
      section when constructing a subsequent request).

   o  <seq> is a numeric value returned to the Consumer client.  On
      issuing any future requests related to the media resource session
      (as determined by the <session-id> element) the consumer client
      MUST increment the value returned in the <seq> element and include
      in the request (see <seq> use later in this section when
      constructing a subsequent request).

   o  <expires> provides a value which represents the number of seconds
      the request for media resources is deemed alive.  The Consumer
      client should issue a refresh of the request, as discussed later
      in this section, if the expires timer is due to fire and the media
      resources are still required.

   o  <media-server-address> provides information representing the
      assigned MS.

   The <mediaResourceRequest> element is used in subsequent Consumer
   interface requests if the client wishes to manipulate the session.



Boulton, et al.         Expires October 15, 2011               [Page 34]

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering              April 2011


   The Consumer client MUST include the <session-info> element which
   enables the receiving MRB to determine an existing media resource
   allocation session.  The <session-info> element has the following
   child elements which provide the appropriate resource session
   information to the MRB:

   o  <session-id> is a unique identifier that allows a Consumer client
      to indicate the appropriate existing media resource session to be
      manipulated by the MRB for this request.  The value was provided
      by the MRB in the initial request for media resources, as
      discussed earlier in this section (<session-id> element included
      as part of the <session-info> element in the initial
      <mediaResourceResponse>).

   o  <seq> is a numeric value returned to Consumer client in the
      initial request for media resources, as discussed earlier in this
      section (<seq> element included as part of the <session-info>
      element in the initial <mediaResourceResponse>).  On issuing any
      future requests related to the specific media resource session (as
      determined by the <session-id> element) the consumer client MUST
      increment the value returned in the <seq> element from the initial
      response (contained in the <mediaResourceResponse>) for every new
      request.  The value of the <seq> element in requests acts as a
      counter to and in conjunction with the unique <session-id> allows
      for unique identification of a request.

   o  <action> element provides the operation to be carried out by the
      MRB on receiving the request:

      *  The value of 'update' is a request by the Consumer client to
         update the existing session at the MRB with alternate
         requirements which are contained in the remainder of the
         request.  If the requested resource information is identical to
         the existing MRB session, the MRB will attempt a session
         refresh.  If the information has changed, the MRB will attempt
         to update the existing session with the new information.  If
         the operation is successful, the 200 status code in the
         response is returned in the status attribute of the
         <mediaResourceResponseType> element.  If the operation is not
         successful, a 409 status code in the response is returned in
         the status attribute of the <mediaResourceResponseType>
         element.

      *  The value of 'remove' is a request by the Consumer client to
         remove the session at the MRB.  This provides a mechanism for
         Consumer clients to release unwanted resources before they
         expire.  If the operation is successful, a 200 status code in
         the response is returned in the status attribute of the



Boulton, et al.         Expires October 15, 2011               [Page 35]

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering              April 2011


         <mediaResourceResponseType> element.  If the operation is not
         successful, a 410 status code in the response is returned in
         the status attribute of the <mediaResourceResponseType>
         element.

   Omitting the 'action' attribute means requesting a new set of
   resources.

   When used with SIP the <session-info> element MUST be included in
   either a SIP re-INVITE (as defined in [RFC3261]) or a SIP UPDATE (as
   defined in[RFC3311]) request.  When used with HTTP the <session-info>
   element MUST be included in a HTTP POST message (as defined in
   [RFC2616]).

   With IAMM, the application server or media server will eventually
   send a SIP BYE to end the SIP session, whether it was for a control
   channel or a call leg.  That BYE contains no Consumer interface lease
   information.  An MRB can be programmed to know that receipt of such a
   BYE also means to free up the media resources that had been requested
   and awarded related to that session.

5.2.4.  Media Service Resource Request

   This section defines the XML elements for the Consumer interface.
   The formal XML schema definition for the Consumer interface can be
   found in Section 11.

   The root element is <mrbconsumer>.  All other XML elements (requests,
   responses) are contained within it.  The MRB Consumer interface
   request element is detailed in Section 5.2.4.1.  MRB Consumer
   interface response element is contained in Section 5.2.5.1.

   The <mrbconsumer> element has the following attributes:

   version:   a token specifying the mrb-consumer package version.  The
      value is fixed as '1.0' for this version of the package.  The
      attribute MUST be present.

   The <mrbconsumer> element has the following child elements, only one
   of which is allowed to occur.

      <mediaResourceRequest> for sending a Consumer request.  See
      Section 5.2.4.1.

      <mediaResourceResponse> for sending a Consumer response.  See
      Section 5.2.5.1.

5.2.4.1.  <mediaResourceRequest> element

   The <mediaResourceRequest> element provides a container for clients
   wishing to query an external MRB entity.  The <mediaResourceRequest>
   element has <generalInfo>, <ivrInfo> and <mixerInfo> as child
   elements.  These three elements are used to describe the requirements
   of a client requesting a Media Server and are covered in the
   following sub-sections.

5.2.4.1.1.  <generalInfo> element

   The <generalInfo> element provides a container for general Consumer
   request information that is neither IVR or Mixer specific.  This
   includes session information that can be used for subsequent requests
   as part of the leasing mechanism described in Section 5.2.3.  The
   following sub-sections describe the elements of the <generalInfo>
   element, <session-info> and <packages>.

5.2.4.1.1.1.  <session-info> element

   The <session-info> element is included in Consumer requests when an
   update is being made to an existing media resource session.  The
   ability to change and remove an existing media resource session is
   described in more detail in Section 5.2.3.  The element MAY be
   present.

   The <session-info> element has no attributes.

   The <session-info> element has the following child elements:

   session-id:   is a unique identifier that explicitly references an
      existing media resource session on the MRB.  The identifier is
      included to update the existing session and is described in more
      detail in Section 5.2.3.

   seq:   is used in association with the <session-id> element in a
      subsequent request to update an existing media resource session on
      an MRB.  The <seq> number is incremented from its original value
      returned in response to the initial request for media resources.
      More information about its use is provided in Section 5.2.3.

   action:   provides the operation that should be carried out on an
      existing media resource session on an MRB:

      *  The value of 'update' instructs the MRB to attempt to update
         the existing media resource session with the information
         contained in the <ivrInfo> and <mixerInfo> elements.

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering              April 2011


      *  The value of 'remove' instructs the MRB to attempt to remove
         the existing media resource session.  More information on its
         use is provided in Section 5.2.3.

5.2.4.1.1.2.  <packages> element

   The <packages> element provides a list of Media Control Channel
   Framework compliant packages that are required by the Consumer
   client.  The element MAY be present.

   The <packages> element has no attributes.

   The <packages> element has the following child element:

   package:   child element contains a string representing the Media
      Control Channel Framework package required by the Consumer client.
      The <package> element can appear multiple times.  A valid value is
      a Control Package name as specified in the related IANA registry
      (e.g., "msc-ivr/1.0")

5.2.4.1.2.  <ivrInfo> element

   The <ivrInfo> element provides a container for general Consumer
   request information that is IVR specific.  The following sub-sections
   describe the elements of the <ivrInfo> element, <ivr-sessions>,
   <file-formats>, <dtmf>, <tones>, <asr-tts>, <vxml>, <location>,
   <encryption>, <application-data>, <max-prepared-duration> and
   <stream-mode>.

5.2.4.1.2.1.  <ivr-sessions> element

   The <ivr-sessions> element indicates the number of IVR sessions a
   Consumer client requires from a media resource.  The element MAY be
   present.

   The <ivr-sessions> element has no attributes.

   The <ivr-sessions> element has the following child element:

   rtp-codec:   child element contains has a single attribute, 'name'.
      The 'name' attribute provides the name of the codec required for
      an IVR session and is an appropriately registered token.  A valid

                     Table 2: <response> status codes

   In case a new media resource request made by an AS (no action) has
   been accepted, the MRB MUST reply with a <mediaResourceResponse> with
   status code 200.  The same rule applies whenever a request to update
   (action='update') or remove (action='remove') an existing transaction
   can be fulfilled by the MRB.

   A media resource request, nevertheless, may fail for several reasons.

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering              April 2011


   In such a case, the status codes defined in Table 1 must be used
   instead.  Specifically, if the MRB fails to handle a request due to a
   syntax error in the request itself (e.g., incorrext XML, violation of
   the schema constraints or invalid values in any of the attributes/
   elements) the MRB MUST reply with a <mediaResourceResponse> with
   status code 400.  If a syntactically correct request fails because
   the request also includes any attribute/element the MRB doesn't
   understand, the MRB MUST reply with a <mediaResourceResponse> with
   status code 420.  If a syntactically correct request fails because
   the MRB couldn't find any MS able to fulfil the requirements
   presented by the AS in its request, the MRB MUST reply with a
   <mediaResourceResponse> with status code 408.  If a syntactically
   correct request fails because the MRB couldn't update an existing
   request according to the new requirements presented by the AS in its
   request, the MRB MUST reply with a <mediaResourceResponse> with
   status code 409.  If a syntactically correct request fails because
   the MRB couldn't remove an existing request and release the related
   resources as requested by the AS, the MRB MUST reply with a
   <mediaResourceResponse> with status code 410.

   Further details on status codes 409 and 410 are presented in
   Section 5.2.3, where the leasing mechanism, together with its related
   scenarios, is described.

   The <mediaResourceResponse> element only has <response-session-info>
   as a child element.  This element is used to describe the response of
   a Consumer interface query and is covered in the following sub-
   section.

5.2.5.1.1.  <response-session-info> element

   The <response-session-info> element is included in Consumer
   responses.  This applies to responses to both requests for new
   resources and requests to update an existing media resource session.
   The ability to change and remove an existing media resource session
   is described in more detail in Section 5.2.3.  The element MAY be
   present: specifically, the element MUST be included in case the
   request was successful, while it would not appear otherwise (e.g., in
   case the request ended up with an error).

   The <response-session-info> element has no attributes.

   The <response-session-info> element has the following child elements:

   session-id:   is a unique identifier that explicitly references an
      existing media resource session on the MRB.  The identifier is
      included to update the existing session and is described in more
      detail in Section 5.2.3.

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering              April 2011


   seq:   is used in association with the <session-id> element in a
      subsequent request to update an existing media resource session on
      an MRB.  The <seq> number is incremented from its original value
      returned in response to the initial request for media resources.
      More information its use is provided in Section 5.2.3.

   expires:   includes the number of seconds that the media resources
      are reserved as part of this interaction.  If the lease is not
      refreshed before expiry, the MRB will re-claim the resources and
      they will no longer be guaranteed.  It is RECOMMENDED that a
      minimum value of 300 seconds be used for the value of the
      'expires' attribute.  It is also RECOMMENDED that a Consumer
      client refresh the lease at an interval that is not too close to
      the expiry time.  A value of 80% of the timeout period could be
      used.  For example, if the timeout period is 300 seconds, the
      Server would refresh the transaction at 240 seconds.  More
      information on its use is provided in Section 5.2.3.

   media-server-address:   provides information to reach the MS handling
      the requested media resource.  The <media-server-address> element
      has a single attribute named 'uri' which supplies the direct
      address to a media server.  It also has three optional elements
      <connection-id>, <ivr-sessions>, and <mixers>.  The <ivr-sessions>
      and <mixers> are defined in Section 5.2.4.1.2.1 and
      Section 5.2.4.1.3.1 and have the same meaning but are applied to
      individual media server instances as a subset of the overall
      resources reported in the <connection-id> element.  For more
      information on the use of the <connection-id> element see
      Section 6.

5.3.  In-Line Unaware MRB Interface

   An entity acting as an In-Line MRB can act in one of two roles for a
   request, as introduced in Section 4.2.  In-Line Unaware MRB Mode
   (IUMM) of operation and In-Line Aware MRB Mode (IAMM) of operation.
   This section further describes IUMM.

   It should be noted that the introduction of an MRB entity into the
   network, as specified in this document, requires interfaces to be
   implemented by those requesting media server resources (for example
   an application server).  This applies when using the Consumer
   interface as discussed in Section 5.2.1(Query mode) and
   Section 5.2.2(IAMM).  Nevertheless, an MRB is conceived to also be
   able to act in a client unaware mode when it is deployed into the
   network.  This allows any SIP compliant client entity, as defined by
   RFC 3261 [RFC3261] and its extensions, to send requests to an MRB
   which in turn will select an appropriate media server based on
   knowledge of media server resources it currently has available



Boulton, et al.         Expires October 15, 2011               [Page 50]

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering              April 2011


   transparently to the client entity.  Using an MRB in this mode allows
   for easy migration of current applications and services that are
   unaware of the MRB concept and would simply require a configuration
   change resulting in the MRB being set as a SIP outbound proxy for
   clients requiring media services.

   With IUMM, the MRB may conclude that an assigned media resource is no
   longer needed when it receives a SIP BYE from the application server
   or media server that ends that SIP dialog that initiated the request.

   As with IAMM, in IUMM the SIP INVITE from the application server
   could convey application/sdp payload to either set up a call leg or a
   Control Framework control channel.  In either case, if the ultimate
   intent is to correlate a call leg with a control channel to the same
   media server, the MRB should be acting as a SIP proxy (and not a
   B2BUA) so that the SIP address of the targeted media server can be
   transparently passed back to the application server in the SIP
   response and so that the SIP dialog information is between the
   application server and the media server.

   While IUMM has the least impact on legacy application servers, it
   also provides the least versatility.  See Section 8.

6.  MRB acting as a B2BUA

   An MRB entity can potentially act as a SIP Back-2-Back-User-Agent
   (B2BUA) or a SIP Proxy Server as defined in RFC 3261 [RFC3261].  When
   acting as a B2BUA issues can arise when using Media Control Channel
   packages such as the IVR
   Package[I-D.ietf-mediactrl-ivr-control-package] and Mixer Packages
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-mixer-control-package].  Specifically the
   Framework attribute 'connectionid' provided in the appendix titled
   'Appendix: Common Package Components' of Media Control Channel
   Framework[I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] uses a
   concatenation of the SIP dialog identifiers to be used for
   referencing SIP dialogs within the media control channel.  When a
   request traverses an MRB acting as a B2BUA, the SIP dialog
   identifiers change and so the 'connectionid' can not be used as
   intended due to the SIP dialog identifiers changing.  For this reason
   when a MRB wishes to act as a SIP B2BUA when handling a request from
   an AS to set up a call leg to a MS it MUST include the optional
   <connection-id> element in a Consumer interface response with a value
   that represents the equivalent for the 'connectionid' ('Local Dialog
   Tag' + 'Remote Dialog Tag') for the far side of the B2BUA.  If
   present, this value MUST be used as the value for the 'connectionid'
   in packages where the Common Package Components are used.  The
   <connection-id> element MUST not be included in a HTTP Consumer
   interface response.

7.  Multi-modal MRB Implementations

   An MRB implementation may operate multi-modally with a collection of
   application server clients all sharing the same pool of media
   resources.  I.e., an MRB may be simultaneously operating in Query
   mode, IAMM and IUMM.  It knows in which mode to act on any particular
   request from a client depending on the nature of the request:

   o  If the received quest is HTTP Post with application/
      mrb-consumer+xml content, then MRB processes it in Query mode.

   o  If the received request is a SIP INVITE with application/
      mrb-consumer+xml content and application/sdp content, then MRB
      processes it in IAMM.

   o  If the received request is a SIP INVITE without application/
      mrb-consumer+xml content but with application/sdp content then MRB
      processes it in IUMM.

8.  Relative Merits of Query Mode, IAMM, and IUMM

   At a high level, the possible application server MRB interactions can
   be distinguished among the following basic types:

   a.  Query mode, in which the client is requesting the assignment by
       MRB of suitable MS resources

   b.  IAMM in which the client is requesting the assignment by MRB of
       suitable MS resources and the establishment of a call leg to the
       MS

   c.  IAMM in which the client is requesting the assignment by MRB of
       suitable MS resources and the establishment of a CFW control
       channel to the MS

   d.  IUMM where the client is requesting the establishment of a call
       leg to MS resources

   e.  IUMM where the client is requesting the establishment of a CFW
       control channel to MS resources

   Each type of interaction has advantages and disadvantages compared to
   the others, where such considerations may have to do with the
   versatility of what MRB can provide, technical aspects such as
   efficiency in different application scenarios, complexity, delay, use
   with legacy application servers, or use with the Media Control
   Channel Framework.  Depending on the characteristics of a particular
   setting that an MRB is intended to support, some of the above
   interaction types may be more appropriate than others.  This section
   makes a few observations on relative merits, but is not intended to
   be exhaustive.  Some constraints of a given interaction type may be
   subtle.

   o  About operation with other types of media control: Any of the
      types of interactions work with the use RFC 4240 [RFC4240] and RFC
      5552 [RFC5552] where initial control instructions are conveyed in
      the SIP INVITE from the application server for the call leg to the
      media server and subsequent instructions may be fetched using
      HTTP.  Query mode (a), IAMM/call leg (b) and IUMM/call leg (d)
      work with MSML as per RFC 5705 [RFC5705] or MSCML as per RFC 4722
      [RFC4722].

   o  As stated previously, IUMM has no interface impacts on an
      application server.  On the other hand, with IUMM the application
      server does not specify the characteristics of the type of media
      resource it needs because the <mediaResourceRequest> element is
      not passed to the MRB.  For IUMM call leg (d) the best the MRB can



Boulton, et al.         Expires October 15, 2011               [Page 54]

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering              April 2011


      do to deduce an appropriate media resource gleaned from examining
      other information in the SIP INVITE, such as the SDP information
      for the call leg, or initial control information in the SIP
      Request URI as per RFC 4240 [RFC4240].  With IUMM/control channel
      (e) there is even less information for the MRB to use.

   o  If using IUMM/control channel (e), the subsequent sending of the
      call leg to the media server should not be done using IUMM/call
      leg.  I.e., the SIP signaling to send the call leg to the selected
      media server must be directly between the application server and
      that media server, and not through the MRB.  Otherwise, MRB might
      send the call leg to a different media server.  Likewise, if using
      IUMM/call leg (d), the subsequent establishment of a control
      channel should not be done with IUMM/control channel (e).

   o  Query mode (a) and IAMM/control channel (c) lend themselves to
      requesting in advance a pool of media resources (e.g., a number of
      IVR or conferencing ports) in advance of use and retaining their
      use over a period of time, independent of whether there are call
      legs to those resources at any given moment, whereas the other
      types of interactions do not.  Likewise for making a subsequent
      request to increase or decrease the amount of resources previously
      awarded.

   o  While Query mode (a) and IAMM/control channel (c) are the most
      versatile interaction types, the former is completely decoupled
      from the use or not of a control channel, whereas the latter
      requires the use of a control channel.

   o  When Media Control Channel Framework control channels are to be
      used in conjunction with the use of MRB, Query mode (a) would
      typically result in fewer such channels being established over
      time as compared to IAMM/control channel (c).  That is because the
      latter would involve setting up an additional control channel
      every time an AS has a new request for MBR for media resources.

9.  Examples

   This section provides examples of both the Publish and Consumer
   interfaces.  For what concerns the Consumer interface, both Query and
   Inline modes are addressed.

   Note that due to RFC formatting conventions, this section often
   splits HTTP, SIP/SDP and CFW across lines whose content would exceed
   72 characters.  A backslash character marks where this line folding
   has taken place.  This backslash and its trailing CRLF and whitespace
   would not appear in the actual protocol contents.  Besides, also note
   that the indentation of the XML content is only provided for
   readability: actual messages will follow strict XML syntax, which
   allows for, but does not require, indentation.

9.1.  Publish Example

   The following example assumes a control channel has been established
   and synced as described in the Media Control Channel Framework
   ([I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework]).

   Figure 9 shows the subscription/notification mechanism the Publish
   interface is based on, as defined in Section 5.1.  The MRB subscribes
   for information at the MS (message A1.), and the MS accepts the
   subscription (A2).  Notifications are triggered by the MS (A3.) and
   acknowledged by the MRB (A4.).

B2. MRB -> MS (200 to CONTROL)
------------------------------
CFW 03fff52e7b7a 200


9.2.  Consumer Example

   As specified in Section 5.2, the Consumer interface can be involved
   in two different modes: Query and Inline-aware.  When in Query mode,
   Consumer messages are transported in HTTP messages: an example of
   such an approach is presented in Section 9.2.1.  When in Inline-aware
   mode, instead, messages are transported as part of SIP negotiations:
   considering this SIP negotiations may be related to either the
   creation of a control channel or to a UAC call leg, two separate
   examples of such an approach are presented in Section 9.2.2.

9.2.1.  Query Example

   The following example assumes the interested AS already knows the
   HTTP URL where an MRB is listening for Consumer messages.

   Figure 10 shows the HTTP-based transaction between the AS and the
   MRB.  The AS sends a consumer request as payload of an HTTP POST
   message (1.), and the MRB provides an answer in an HTTP 200 OK
   message (2.).  Specifically, as it will be shown in the dumps, the AS
   is interested in 100 IVR ports: the MRB finds two MS that can satisfy
   the request (one providing 60 ports, the other 40 ports) and reports
   them to the AS.

   The rest of the scenario is omitted for brevity.  After having
   received the 'mediaResourceResponse', the AS has the address of two
   MS able to fulfil its media requirements, and can start a Control
   Dialog with one or both of them.

9.2.2.  IAMM Example

   As anticipated, two separate examples are presented for the IAMM
   case: in fact, IAMM-mode can take advantage of two different
   approaches with respect to the SIP dialogs to be exploited to carry
   consumer messages, i.e.: i) a SIP control dialog to create a control
   channel, and, ii) a UAC call leg to attach to a MS.  To make things
   clearer for the reader, the same consumer request as the one
   presented in the Query mode will be sent, in order to clarify how the
   behaviour of the involved parties may differ.

9.2.2.1.  IAMM Example: CFW-based approach

   The following example assumes the interested AS already knows the SIP
   URI where an MRB is listening as an UAS.

   Figure 11 shows the first approach, i.e.  SIP-based transactions
   involving the AS interested in setting up a control channel, the MRB
   and the MS that will be chosen eventually.  The diagram is more
   complex than before.  This is basically a scenario envisaging the MRB
   as a B2BUA.  The AS sends a SIP INVITE (1.), containing both a CFW-
   related SDP and a Consumer request (multipart body).  The MRB sends a
   provisional response to the AS (2.) and starts working on the
   request.  First of all, it makes use of the Consumer request from the
   AS to determine which MS should be exploited.  Once the right MS have
   been chosen, the MRB sends a new SIP INVITE to one of the MS by just
   including the SDP part of the original request (3.).  The MS
   negotiates this INVITE as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] (4., 5., 6.), providing
   the MRB with its own CFW-related SDP.  The MRB replies to the

   original AS INVITE preparing a SIP 200 OK with another multipart body
   (7.): this multipart body includes the Consumer response used by the
   MRB to determine the right MS and the SDP returned by the MS in 5.
   The AS finally acknowledges the 200 OK (8.), and can start a CFW
   connection towards the MS.

   Please note that, to ease the reading of the protocol contents, a
   simple '=_Part' is used whenever a boundary for a 'multipart/mixed'
   payload is provided, instead of the actual boundary that would be
   inserted in the SIP messages.

         Figure 11: Consumer Example (IAMM-CFW): Sequence Diagram

   The rest of this section includes an almost full dump of the messages
   associated with the previous sequence diagram.  Only the relevant SIP
   messages are shown (both the INVITEs and the 200 OKs), and only the
   relevant headers are preserved for brevity (Content-Type and
   multipart-related information).  Specifically:

   1.  the original INVITE (1), containing both a CFW-related SDP
       (COMEDIA information to negotiate a new Control Channel) and a
       Consumer <mediaResourceRequest>;

   2.  the INVITE sent by the MRB to the MS as a B2BUA (3.), containing
       only the CFW-related SDP from the original INVITE;.

   3.  the 200 OK sent by the MS back to the MRB (5.), to complete the
       CFW-related negotiation (SDP only);

   4.  the 200 OK sent by the MRB back to the AS in response to the
       original INVITE (7.), containing both the CFW-related information
       sent by the MS and a Consumer <mediaResourceRequest> documenting
       the MRB's decision to use that MS.

   As it can be evinced from the dumps, the only difference in the
   response the MRB provides the AS with is in the 'connection-id'
   attribute that is added to the first allocated MS instance: this
   allows the AS to understand the MRB has sent the CFW channel
   negotiation to that specific MS, and that the connection-id to be
   used (should the SIP control dialog also include media-related SDP
   later on) is the one provided.  This will be more carefully described
   in the next section, for the call leg-based approach.

   The continuation of the scenario (the AS connecting to the MS to
   start the Control Channel, the SYNC message, etc.) are omitted for
   brevity.

9.2.2.2.  IAMM Example: Call leg-based approach

   The following example assumes the interested AS already knows the SIP
   URI where an MRB is listening as an UAS.

   Figure 12 shows the second approach, i.e.  SIP-based transactions
   related to a UAC call leg the AS wants to attach to a MS, the MRB and
   the MS that will be chosen eventually.  The interaction is basically
   the same as before (e.g. for what concerns the multipart body) but
   considering a new party is involved in the communication, the diagram
   is slightly more complex than before.  As before, the MRB acts as a
   B2BUA.  A UAC sends a SIP INVITE to a SIP URI handled by the AS,
   since it is interested to its services (1.).  The AS sends a
   provisional response (2.) and, since it doesn't have the resources
   yet, sends to the MRB a new SIP INVITE (3.), containing both the UAC
   media-related SDP and a Consumer request (multipart body).  The MRB
   sends a provisional response to the AS (4.) and starts working on the
   request.  First of all, it makes use of the Consumer request from the
   AS to determine which MS should be exploited.  Once the right MS have
   been chosen, the MRB sends a new SIP INVITE to one of the MS by just
   including the SDP part of the original request (5.).  The MS
   negotiates this INVITE as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] (6., 7., 8.) to allocate
   the needed media resources to handle the new call leg, eventually
   providing the MRB with its own media-related SDP.  The MRB replies to
   the original AS INVITE preparing a SIP 200 OK with another multipart
   body (9.): this multipart body includes the Consumer response used by
   the MRB to determine the right MS and the SDP returned by the MS in
   7.  The AS finally acknowledges the 200 OK (10.), and ends the
   scenario by eventually providing the UAC with the SDP it needs to
   setup the RTP channels with the chosen MS: a separate direct SIP
   control dialog may be initiated by the AS to the same MS in order to
   set up a control channel to manipulate the call leg media.

   Please note that, to ease the reading of the protocol contents, a
   simple '=_Part' is used whenever a boundary for a 'multipart/mixed'
   payload is provided, instead of the actual boundary that would be
   inserted in the SIP messages.

       Figure 12: Consumer Example (IAMM-CallLeg): Sequence Diagram

   The rest of this section includes an almost full dump of the messages
   associated with the previous sequence diagram.  Only the relevant SIP
   messages are shown (both the INVITEs and the 200 OKs), and only the
   relevant headers are preserved for brevity (Content-Type, From/To and
   multipart-related information).  Specifically:

   1.  the original INVITE (1), containing the media-related SDP sent by
       a UAC;

   2.  the original INVITE (3), containing both the media-related SDP
       and a Consumer <mediaResourceRequest>;

   3.  the INVITE sent by the MRB to the MS as a B2BUA (5.), containing
       only the media-related SDP from the original INVITE;

   4.  the 200 OK sent by the MS back to the MRB (7.), to complete the
       media-related negotiation (SDP only);

   5.  the 200 OK sent by the MRB back to the AS in response to the
       original INVITE (9.), containing both the media-related
       information sent by the MS and a Consumer <mediaResourceRequest>
       documenting the MRB's decision to use that MS;

   6.  the 200 OK sent by the AS back to the UAC to have it setup the
       RTP channel(s) with the MS (11.).

   As it can be evinced from the dumps, as in the IAMM-CFW example the
   MRB provides the AS with a 'connection-id' attribute in the consumer
   response: this connection-id allows the AS to understand the MRB has
   sent the SDP media negotiation to that specific MS, and that the
   connection-id to be used in CFW requests is the one provided.  This
   attribute is needed, since, according to the framework specification,
   the AS should build this connection-id out of the From/To tags
   extracted from the negotiation with the MS: since the MRB acts as a
   B2BUA in this scenario, without that attribute the AS and the MS
   would refer to different tags and, as a consequence, different
   connection-ids, thus preventing the CFW protocol to work as expected.

   The continuation of the scenario (the AS connecting to the MS to
   start the Control Channel, the SYNC message, etc.) are omitted for
   brevity.

12.  Security Considerations

   The MRB network entity has two primary interfaces, Publish and
   Consumer, that carry sensitive information and must therefore be
   appropriately protected and secured.

   The Publish interface, as defined in and described in Section 5.1,
   uses the Media Control Channel Framework
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] as a mechanism to connect
   an MRB to a media server.  The appropriate Security Considerations
   included in the Media Control Channel Framework specification MUST be
   used in conjunction with this specification to protect interactions
   between an MRB and a media server.

   The Consumer interface, as defined in and described in Section 5.2,
   uses either the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) as the mechanism for clients to connect to
   an MRB to request media resources.  In the case of the HTTP use, any
   binding using the Consumer interface MUST be capable of being
   transacted over TLS, as described in RFC 2818 [RFC2818].  In the case
   of the SIP use, the appropriate security considerations included in
   the Media Control Channel Framework specification MUST be used in
   conjunction with this specification to protect interactions between a
   client requesting media resources and an MRB.

   It is also worth noting that in In-line mode (both IAMM and IUMM) the
   MRB may act as a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA).  This means that,
   as a B2BUA, the MRB may happen to modify SIP bodies: it is the case,
   for instance, of the IAMM handling multipart/mixed payloads.  This
   impacts the ability to use any SIP security feature that protects the
   body (e.g., RFC4474, s/mime, etc.) unless the MRB intermediates the
   security association.  This should be taken into account when
   implementing an MRB compliant with this specification.

   Finally, it is worthwhile to also discuss authorization issues
   related to the specification.  Neither the Publishing nor the
   Consumer interface provide an explicit means for implementing
   authentication, i.e., they do not envisage protocol messages to make
   sure, for instance, that only authorized Application Servers can make
   use of the services provided by a MRB.  Nevertheless, considering
   both the interfaces are transported in well-established protocols
   (HTTP, SIP, CFW), support for such an functionality can be expressed
   by means of the authentication mechanisms provided by the protocol
   themselves.  Therefore, any MRB-aware entity (Application Servers,
   Media Servers, Media Resource Brokers themselves) MUST support the
   HTTP and SIP Digest access authentication.  That said, the usage of
   such Digest access authentications is recommended and not mandatory,
   which means MRB-aware entities MAY exploit it in deployment.
