Internet-Draft              IANA SRV registry                  Sept 2009


1.  Introduction

   The SRV resource record (RR) was originally introduced in RFC 2052
   [RFC2052] as an experimental extension to the Domain Name System
   (DNS).  It proved a highly valuable addition for service location and
   provisioning.  The SRV record was thus standardized in RFC 2782
   [RFC2782].  The main difference between these two versions is the use
   of the "_" prefix character in names to avoid naming conflicts
   between service names and regular names.

   The presentation form of the SRV resource record (RR type 33),
   including the recommended naming structure for its use, is as follows
   RFC 2782 [RFC2782]:
      _Service._Proto.Name SRV Priority Weight Port Target

   The "_Service" label indicates the name of the Service/Application
   that is being offered.  The "_Proto" label denotes the name of the
   transport protocol to be used for the service.  "Name" is the domain
   name that is offering the service.  The PORT field is the port number
   the service is provide at the Target name.  The Priority and Weight
   fields are used for selecting among multiple SRV records at the same
   owner name.

   RFC 2782 says that the source of names for "Service" and "Proto" is
   "Assigned Numbers" (STD2) or a locally defined repository.

   Note:  The STD2 series of documents was obsoleted by RFC 3232
      [RFC3232] and IANA registration publication was handed over to on-
      line registries maintained by IANA.  Unfortunately it is not
      explicitly explained in RFC 2782 which section of STD2 it is
      referring to, nor does RFC 3232 help.  By common knowledge, RFC
      2782 referred to the Keyword columns of the "Protocol Numbers" and
      "Port Numbers" IANA registries.

   However, upon reflection, both alternatives do not seem to make
   particular sense:

   o  As SRV records contain the port where each server provides the
      service, the outmost utility of SRV RRs is for services that do
      not have a registered port number.  Also, the number of ports
      available is small compared to the possible number of service
      names that could be registered.  Therefore, the Port Number
      registry needs a more strict registration policy and is not the
      proper place for registering Service names for use with SRV
      resource records.
   o  Having locally defined lists of Service and/or Proto names would
      equally allow to list the full service information in such local
      databases and thus make the usage of SRV records redundant.  In

Internet-Draft              IANA SRV registry                  Sept 2009


      any case this scenario is not applicable for publicly available
      services where potential clients are not under the control of the
      authority offering the services, and hence most probably would
      have no access to the proper "locally provided" information.  The
      reader should be reminded that locally maintained database
      solutions generally scale very poorly, and that this once was the
      major momentum for the deployment of the Domain Name System.

   For these reasons this document creates a separate IANA registry for
   Services that allow or specify service discovery via SRV look-up.

   Note:  A couple of RFCs published in the past pretend to have
      registered with IANA particular SRV Service/Protocol combinations,
      but at the time of this writing, evidence shows that this did not
      happen actually.  Section 4.2 tries to collect this past wisdom to
      initiallly populate the new registry.

   This Service Registry explicitly removes the constraint that services
   need a port number registration.  The registration requirement for
   this new registry is set low in order to make it relatively easy to
   register a new service name.

   To a large extent the requirement to register port numbers can be
   eliminated by encouraging SRV for service discovery and location in
   all new application protocols.  For this reason there MUST NOT be a
   name conflict between what is registered in the SRV registry defined
   in this document and the legacy service names int the port numbers
   registry.  See Section (2.2) (Section 2.2) for a discussion on such
   name conflicts.

   In the spirit of BCP 17, RFC 2219 [RFC2219], this registry should
   also help providing an orderly substitute for the poorly specified
   Well-Known Network Service Alias names.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] .


2.  SRV registry considerations

   Registering a new service should be easy and painless process, all
   that is needed is a pointer to a service description.  In some cases
   applicants may not want to release the service/protocol specification
   and that is fine.

2.1.  To _ or not to _

   The original SRV RFC used regular DNS names for service and transport
   names, this was shown to cause some name conflicts.  For example it
   is impossible to have the name "TCP" delegation and also provide a
   service on http.tcp.  For this reason the current SRV RFC specifies
   the use of "_" in front of all names for both transports and
   services.  The argument for following this nomenclature for
   transports is clear and needed.  On the other hand, having a full DNS
   name space created on the left of each transport name, the argument
   for name collision in the services does not apply.  Arguments that
   the presence of the "_" character makes it easier to spot this is a
   service are not convincing.  IDN Service names will work better if
   "_" is not used.

2.1.1.  Service name mainainance

   As Service names are a DNS label, the strings can be over 60
   characters long, and possibly IDN strings.  This is large enough
   space that reuse and recaiming names is not an issue, unlike the port
   space.

2.2.  Name collisions in service registrations

   As this document allows registrations of NEW services without the the
   "_" prefix, these registrations MUST NOT collide with pre-existing
   registrations that start with or without the prefix "_".  A name
   collision is defined to occur if two labels are equal after stripping
   of the "_" prefix and downcaseing.


3.  SRV protocols

   This section contains the known Transport protocol identifiers.  In
   number of RFCs there have been examples where services/protocols are
   defined to work over "Overlay"/Alternate (Substrate) protocols such
   as xmpp and http.

4.2.1.  RFC examples and pointers

   There are few instances where RFC's have what looks like SRV names
   but are just examples and should not be registered.  This section for
   completeness contains any such instances the editors are aware off.
   o  _iris-* RFC 3981 appendix A
   o  _mail RFC 4985
   o  _ntp RFC 4085
   o  _pigen RFC 3091
   o  _telnet RFC 3620
   o  _ssh RFC 4592

   There are few instances where RFC's hint at external SRV usage/names
   but the editors have not been able to track down the documents
   o  RFC 4123 says: ITU-T H.323 Annex O also defines SRV use.
   o  RFC 4280 points to 3GPP specs defining use(s?) of SRV.


5.  Relationship to Other IANA Registries
      The SRV Service Identifiers registry is not a replacement for the
      two, more specific registries established by RFC 3861 [RFC3861],
      the "Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label Registry" currently
      located at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/im-srv-labels> and the
      target="Presence SRV Protocol Label Registry" currently located at
      <http://www.iana.org/assignments/pres-srv-labels>
      Currently, there is one registration ("_xmpp") in each of these
      registries, performed by RFC 3921 [RFC3921], and another, more
      recent registration ("_sip"), performed by RFC 5509 [RFC5509], and
      this is reflected above.
      To avoid service name collisions, future registrations in the
      above two registries should always be accompanied by registrations
      in the SRV Service Name registry.
      The IANA "Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Parameters"
      "PKIX SRV Protocol Labels" sub-registry currently filed at
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/pkix-parameters contains a single
      entry for the service label "_pkixrep" in combination with three
      protocols, based on RFC 4386 [RFC4386], which has been included in
      Table 3.  Arguably, that sub-registry might be abandoned by a
      future update of [RFC4386], in favor of making use of the new,
      general- purpose registry defined in this document, since it
      fulfills all requirements posed in sections 2 amd 4 of that RFC.

   time ago, this in its own does not have any security implications.

   sub-registries is "IETF Revies" RFC 5226 [RFC5226].

   First sub-registry is: "DNS SRV Protocol Labels".  Allocation policy
   is "IETF Reveiew"[RFC5226].  Initial Contents of the registry are in
   section 3.

   NOTE: If Overlay is split from the Protocol sub-registry that becomes
   an additional action.  Do we need "Standard Action" policy for
   "Transport" protocols vs. "IETF Review" for "Substrate" protocols?

   Second sub-registry is: "SRV Service Labels".  Allocation policy is
   "First Come First Served [RFC5226], but MUST NOT conflict with names
   in port number registry".  Rules for Labels to be registered are in
   Section 4.  A Template for registrations is in section 4.1.  IANA
   will archive and make available all accepted registrations via links
   from the registry.  Open Issue: Are IDN lablels allowed?  The initial
   content of the registry is specified in Section 4.2.
