  <abstract>
  
    <t> This draft presents two extensions to the DTN bundle protocol. 
      The first extension is the use of relative time rather than
      absolute time to address situations where the DTN nodes cannot
      achieve loosely synchronized clocks, as required by the current
      DTN bundle protocol.  The second extension is the addition of a
      "hops-to-live" field to the bundle header, which specifies how
      many node-to-node hops each instance of a bundle is permitted to
      make before it expires.  </t>

    <t> These two extensions are separable; either may be used
      independently of the other.  Used together, however, they
      provide a powerful way to constrain resources consumed by the
      handling of a DTN bundle despite the absence of synchronized
      clocks or the presence of incomplete knowledge of the network
      topology (which may lead to the presence of hazards such as
      routing loops).  </t>

  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

    <section title="Problems Establishing a Real-time Clock">

      <t> Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) is an
	architecture and a set of protocols that enable communication
	in environments with intermittent connectivity and long
	delays.  An architecture for disruption tolerant networks
	<xref target='RFC4838'/> has been defined.  This architecture
	describes disruption tolerant networks in terms of DTN nodes
	that create, relay, and deliver units of information termed
	bundles.  Each bundle is defined to have a finite lifetime,
	after which it is deemed to be expired.  A full definition of
	the protocol for creating, interpreting, and handling bundles
	by DTN nodes has also been defined <xref target='RFC5050'/>. 
	</t>

      <t> One issue that has been raised about the bundle protocol is
	that it assumes that every node in the network has access to a
	realtime clock, and all of these realtime clocks are
	synchronized to a reasonable degree (typically within a small
	number of seconds).  This assumption, when it holds, provides
	the convenience that the timing of both future events (i.e.,
	when a bundle should expire because it is no longer needed, or
	no longer relevant) and past events (i.e., when a bundle was
	created or delivered) may be represented using this common,
	absolute frame of reference.  </t>

      <t> Unfortunately, our experiences in deploying disruption
	tolerant networks have shown that the problem of establishing
	a common realtime clock is currently intractable in some
	real-world scenarios.  The reason is usually a combination of
	several factors:  </t>

      <t> <list style="symbols">

	<t> DTN nodes may have reliable, inaccurate clocks.  These
	  clocks might not have been initialized to the correct time
	  or may have lost power since their initialization, or may
	  drift significantly over time.  </t>

	<t> The links between the DTN nodes may often be disrupted. 
	  The nodes might not be able to communicate with an accurate
	  time source to find the current time, or to run a time
	  synchronization protocol such as NTP <xref
	  target="RFC2030"/> to negotiate a shared time reference. 
	  </t>

	<t> Bundle lifetimes may be short.  If bundle lifetimes
	  are comparable with the amount of clock drift that can
	  accumulate between good clock settings, bundles may appear
	  to have expired before they are sent.  </t>

      </list> </t>

      <t> There have been other discussions of extensions to the
	bundle protocol to address the problem of unsynchronized
	clocks in the context of DTN <xref
	target="I-D.farrell-dtnrg-alt-time"/>.  </t>

  <section anchor="proposal" title="Changes to the DTN Bundle Header">

    <t> The changes described in this document are relative to version
      6 ("DTNv6") of the DTN bundle protocol <xref target='RFC5050'/>. 
      Fields of the bundle header that are not mentioned in this
      section should be assumed to have the identical format and
      meaning as described in RFC5050.  </t>

    <section title="The Version">

      <t> We propose that version number 7 be assigned to represent
	bundles that include any of the new fields described in this
	proposal.  </t>

      <t> In order to differentiate bundles represented in the
	proposed format, it is customary to choose a different version
	number than that employed any past or current version of the
	bundle protocol.  Although this is optional in our proposal
	(because version 6 bundles may be interpreted as a subset of
	version 7 bundles, with the difference being determined
	entirely via the Bundle Processing Flags, as described in
	<xref target="proposal-proc"/>), this approach is
	extremely likely to lead to problems with backwards
	compatibility.  Current implementations of DTN do not check
	for the new Bundle Processing Flag values, and therefore would
	misinterpret bundles that used any of the new functionality
	proposed here.  </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="proposal-proc" title="Bundle Processing Flags">

      <t>
	<list style="hanging">

	  <t hangText="Bits 0-19"> There are no changes to the lower
	    20 bits of the bundle processing flags.  </t>

	  <t hangText="Bit 20 (the RT bit)"> If bit 20 is 1, then use
	    relative time (RT) instead of absolute time (AT).  If 0,
	    then use absolute time, in a manner compatible with DTNv6,
	    and the Remaining Lifetime (RL) field (described in
	    <xref target="proposal-rl"/> MUST be omitted. 
	    </t>

	  <t hangText="Bit 21 (the HTL bit)"> If bit 21 is 1, then use
	    the Hops to Live (HTL) field to determine whether a bundle
	    should be discarded because it has traversed too many
	    hops.  If 0, then the Hops to Live field is ignored, and
	    the Hops to Live field (described in <xref
	    target="proposal-htl"/>) MUST be omitted.  </t>

	</list>
      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="proposal-creationtimestamptime"
	title="Creation Timestamp Time">

      <t> If the RT bit in the bundle processing flags is 0, then this
	field is initialized, interpreted, and used exactly as in
	DTNv6.  </t>
	
      <t> When the RT bit in the bundle processing flags is 1, then
	this field is not used to determine when a bundle expires. </t>
	
      <t> Note that the Creation Timestamp SHOULD be initialized with
	the current local time because the Creation Timestamp is often
	used for additional purposes, such as creating unique bundle
	identifiers.  If the node does not have a reliable source of
	local time (at minimum, a monotonically increasing counter)
	then this implies that the Creation Timestamp Sequence Number
	must be created in such a way that it alone suffices to ensure
	uniqueness across all bundles created on the local node.  This
	property is not guaranteed by the method for choosing the
	Creation Timestamp sequence number described in DTNv6, which
	relies upon the existence of a good, monotonically-increasing
	local clock, but may be guaranteed via other methods.  </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="proposal-lifetime" title="Bundle Lifetime">

      <t> This field represents the number of seconds that a bundle
	may exist between its creation and expiration.  This meaning
	is the same as in DTNv6, and is the same for both AT and RT
	modes.  The only difference between AT and RT modes is how the
	calculation of the age of a bundle is performed.  </t>

      <t> In AT mode, the local clock is assumed to be synchronized
	(or nearly synchronized) with the clock of the node that
	created the bundle, and therefore the calculation is performed
	by comparing the difference between the of the local clock and
	the Creation Timestamp of the bundle.  If this difference is
	greater than the Lifetime, then the bundle has expired.  </t>

      <t> In RT mode, the Creation Timestamp field is not used to
	perform this calculation, but is only used as a reference for
	the sake of backwards compatibility with AT mode.  The
	Remaining Lifetime field (described in <xref
	target="proposal-rl"/> is used to determine whether or not a
	bundle has expired.  When the Remaining Lifetime reaches zero,
	the bundle has expired.  </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="proposal-rl" title="Remaining Lifetime">

      <t> This is a new field that does not exist in DTNv6. </t>

      <t> The "Remaining Lifetime" (RL) field is an SDNV field
	that specifies how many seconds the bundle can remain in the
	system before it expires.  </t>

      <t> The RL is expressed in seconds, as an SDNV.  It is
	decremented as the bundle is processed, and the bundle expires
	when it reaches zero.  </t>

      <t> If the bundle is created in RT mode, then the initial value
	of the Remaining Lifetime field MUST be identical to the value
	of the Lifetime field.  At each hop, the Remaining Lifetime is
	decremented by the length of time that has elapsed since the
	previous hop, rounded down to the nearest second.  </t>

      <t> There are several points in the handling of a bundle
	where the Remaining Lifetime may be decremented by the
	BPA.  These include: </t>
	
      <t> <list style="symbols">
      
	<t> When the bundle is received by a convergence layer adapter
	  (CLA).  The CLA may have knowledge about the time required
	  for the bundle to traverse the link, given the size of the
	  bundle, the effective bandwidth of the channel, and the
	  latency or propagation delay of the channel (which may be
	  the most significant factor in the case of links between DTN
	  nodes separated by light-seconds or light-minutes of
	  distance).  </t>

	<t> When the bundle is retrieved from local storage.  </t>

	<t> When the bundle is idle in the BPA for a significant
	  period of time, for any reason, such as waiting for a router
	  to compute a route and choose a CLA.  </t>

      </list> </t>

      <t> For some applications, such as using DTN to move small
	bundles within a MANET, the effective processing and
	transmission delay may generally be small enough so that the
	only time that the Remaining Lifetime field needs to be
	decremented is when a bundle is retrieved from local storage. 
	For other applications, such moving large bundles between deep
	space nodes, the channel latency and transmission delays must
	also be considered.  </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="proposal-htl" title="Hops to Live">

      <t> This is a new field that does not exist in DTNv6.  </t>

      <t> The Hops to Live (HTL) field is an SDNV field that specifies
	the number of "hops" (transitions from one DTN node to
	another) that the bundle is permitted to make before the
	bundle expires.  </t>

      <t> If the HTL bit is not set in the Bundle Processing Flag,
	then this field is omitted.  </t>

  <section title="Discussion">

    <section title="The Granularity of the Remaining Lifetime">

      <t> If a bundle is forwarded "quickly" through a node, and the
	transfer time is small, then its RL might not be decremented
	(since the elapsed time is always rounded down to the nearest
	second, and many bundles will require less than one second to
	receive and forward).  Therefore a bundle may survive for many
	seconds longer than its RL, as long as it continues to make
	steady progress hops.  The only time that the RL will be
	decremented is if the bundle is "stalled" in a node and
	remains there for longer than one second.  </t>

      <t> Is this what we want, or should the RL be measured in a
	finer unit (milliseconds?  microseconds?  nanoseconds?), so
	that it is decremented even when a bundle is forwarded without
	only a very small amount of delay, and bundles can still
	expire even if they are never stalled? </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="compat-bsp"
	     title="Compatibility with the Bundle Security Protocol">

      <t> We can reuse the bundle header canonical format used by the
	Bundle Security Protocol (BSP)
	<xref target="I-D.irtf-dtnrg-bundle-security"/> of DTNv6 for this
	proposed format.  </t>

      <t> The only question is whether there is any need to protect
	the Hops to Live or Remaining Lifetime fields in a way more
	powerful than provided by the current hop-by-hop security.  </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Startup Issues">

      <t> If the BPA is shut down (or crashes, etc) or for some other
	reason loses track of the passage of time, it may not be able
	to update the RL properly for bundles that it has in its
	storage system.  This problem is particularly difficult if
	there is no reliable way to determine whether the clock has
	changed when the BPA was down.  </t>

      <t> There are several possible approaches: </t>
      
      <t> <list style="numbers">

	<t> If the device has access to an accurate clock, or can
	  reliably measure the passage of time even when it is shut
	  down, the receipt time of all bundles could be recorded and
	  used normally, as if the shutdown had not occurred. </t>

	<t> Assume that no time has passed since the shut down and
	  that the local clock has not been altered.  The remaining
	  RL of bundles stored locally is not impacted by the
	  reboot.  </t>

	<t> Assume that a period of time equal to the expected time
	  required to shut down and restart the node has elapsed. 
	  This assumes that the node was not actually halted, but
	  simply reset.  </t>

	<t> Assume that an unknown and potentially large period of
	  time has elapsed since the system was shut down.  This
	  period of time may be chosen arbitrarily (i.e., it may
	  reduce to the previous case).  </t>

	<t> Assume that a period of time greater than the longest
	  remaining lifetime of any bundle in storage has elapsed
	  since the system was shut down, and therefore all stored
	  bundles with an RL have expired.  </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Compatibility with DTNv6">

      <t> In this section, we outline how bundles may be translated
	between the proposed protocol and DTNv6. </t>

      <t> We note that the reviewers of this draft feel that the
	utility of backward compatibility with DTNv6 is questionable
	and agree that it adds complexity in implementation.  In
	<xref target="compat-disc"/> we discuss some of the
	obstacles to complete compatibility.  </t>

      <t> There is a mechanical way to rewrite bundle headers
	traversing from nodes that implement DTNv6 to nodes that
	implement the proposed protocol and vice versa, assuming that
	all the intermediate nodes between the trans-protocol
	frontiers share a common clock (which is a valid assumption in
	some cases).  Two DTN nodes that share a common clock may
	correctly communicate via either DTNv6 or the proposed
	protocol, using either RT or AT mode, but two nodes that do
	not share a common clock must use the proposed protocol in RT
	mode (or some equivalent mechanism) in order to ensure correct
	communication.  </t>

      <section title="Changing from AT to RT mode">

	<t> This section specifies an algorithm for transforming an AT
	  mode bundle header to an RT mode bundle header.  </t>

	<t> <list style="numbers">

	  <t> Calculate the value of the Remaining Lifetime field by
	    computing the difference between the expiration time of
	    the bundle (the sum of the Creation Timestamp and the

	  <t> Create a new bundle header, with the same contents as
	    the current header, but set the RT mode bit in the Bundle

      <section anchor="compat-disc" title="Discussion">

	<t> The process of conversion between RT and AT mode may break
	  central assumptions about how bundles may be uniquely
	  identified.  For example, some DTN implementations use the
	  Creation Timestamp as part of their check to see whether a
	  given bundle has already been seen.  If there are two
	  versions of the bundle (one in RT mode, and the other in AT
	  mode) then this test will not reliably detect duplicates
	  unless additional steps are taken to normalize the bundle
	  header fields before comparison.  </t>

	<t> An additional problem is that this rewriting is not
	  backwards-compatible with BSP, because it changes the length
	  of the bundle header and also modifies the value of the
	  Creation Timestamp field, which is part of the canonical
	  representation of the bundle header <xref
	  target="I-D.irtf-dtnrg-bundle-security"/>.  </t>

	<t> Is it worth providing this mechanism, even though we know
	  that it doesn't work with BSP?  </t>

	<t> To work with BSP, one practical alternative is to use
	  Bundle-in-Bundle, with a special (to-be-defined) tag, but
	  this has issues as well.  </t>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Bundle Status Reports">

      <t> Timestamps appear in bundle status reports (i.e., time when
	a bundle was deleted or delivered).  In DTNv6, these are all
	specified in absolute time, because it is assumed that any
	node or app that reads the timestamps will be in the same
	frame of reference as the writer.  If this assumption is
	false, then these timestamps have no useful interpretation. 
	</t>

      <t> One possible modification, whose interpretation makes sense
	in "relative time" mode, is to replace these timestamps with
	the value of the time-to-live field on the bundle at the
	moment that the status change occurred (e.g., "this bundle was
	delivered five seconds before it would have expired"), or the
	lifetime field minus the time-to-live field (e.g., "this
	bundle was delivered twelve seconds after it was created").

    <section title="Incompatibility with the Bundle Security Protocol">

      <t> As mentioned in <xref target="compat-bsp"/> and
	<xref target="compat-disc"/>, the changes proposed in this
	document may require changes to BSP as well.  </t>

    <section title="Bundle Lifetime Limits and Incorrect Creation Times">

      <t> A malicious or incorrect DTN node may create bundles with
	excessive lifetimes.  This consideration is not unique to the
	proposed protocol, but already exists in DTNv6.  If a DTN node
	creates a bundle with a very long Lifetime (in RT or AT mode),
	or a Creation Timestamp in the future (in AT mode), then the
	bundle may consume DTN resources for a very long time.  It is
	possible to imagine a denial-of-service attack on a DTN by an
	attacker who slowly clogs the network with many immortal bundles
	that consume resources until the network is unable to accept
	any new bundles. </t>

      <t> Every DTN node should have a policy about how it will handle
	a bundle with a Creation Timestamp from the future (for AT
	mode), an excessive Lifetime (in AT or RT mode) or Remaining
	Lifetime (in RT mode).  How such a policy is specified is
	beyond the scope of this document.  </t>

  <section title="IANA Considerations">                               

    <t> If a IANA registry for bundle protocol version numbers is ever
      created, then it will need to be updated to assign a new number
      to the protocol described by this document.  </t>
