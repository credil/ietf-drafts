                   Route Leak Attacks Against BGPSEC
       draft-foo-sidr-simple-leak-attack-bgpsec-no-help-00

Abstract

   This document describes a very simple attack vector that illustrates
   how RPKI-enabled BGPSEC machinery as currently defined can be easily
   circumvented in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack via
   BGP.  It is meant to serve as input to the SIDR WG during routing
   security requirements specification and discussions, and secure
   routing protocol designs.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a very simple attack vector that illustrates
   how RPKI-enabled BGPSEC machinery as currently defined can be easily
   circumvented in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack via
   BGP.  It is meant to serve as input to the SIDR WG during routing
   security requirements specification and discussions, and secure
   routing protocol designs.

Internet-Draft      Route Leak Attacks Against BGPSEC      November 2011


2.  Discussion

   Assume a stub Autonomous System (AS), AS 1, multi-homed to two ISPs
   (ISP1 & ISP2) wishes to insert themselves in the datapath between a
   target network (prefix P) connected to ISP2 and systems in ISP1's
   network in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack.
   Further assume that an RPKI-enabled BGPSEC as currently defined is
   fully deployed and functioning as designed by all parties in this
   scenario.

   Network operators on the Internet today typically prefer customer
   routes over routes learned from bi-lateral or settlement free peers.
   Network operators accomplish this via BGP Path Attributes,
   specifically LOCAL_PREF, that are evaluated earlier in the BGP Path
   Selection process than AS_PATH length.

   As currently defined, BGPSEC only provides two functions:

   1.  Is an Autonomous System authorized to originate an IP prefix?

   2.  Is the AS_PATH represented in the route the same as the list of
   ASes through which the NLRI traveled?

   In order for an attacker (AS 1), to divert traffic from ISP1 for
   prefix P through their AS they simply fail to scope the propagation
   of the target prefix P (received from ISP2) by announcing a
   (syntactically correct) BGPSEC update for prefix P to ISP1.  This
   vulnerability is what the authors refer to as a 'route leak'.  It is
   important to note that the default behavior in BGP is to announce all
   best paths to external BGP peers, unless explicitly scoped by a BGP
   speaker through configuration.  Because ISP1 prefers prefixes learned
   from customers (AS 1) over prefixes learned from peers (ISP2), they
   begin forwarding traffic for prefix P destinations through the
   attacker's AS (AS 1).  Viola!

   Discussion of out of band methods to mitigate this attack are beyond
   the scope of this document.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document describes an attack on an RPKI-enabled BGPSEC and is
   meant to inform the IETF Secure Inter-Domain Routing Working Group on
   the vulnerabilty that exists as a result of "leaks".
