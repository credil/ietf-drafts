               Deprecation of BGP AS_SET, AS_CONFED_SET.
                draft-ietf-idr-deprecate-as-sets-02.txt

Abstract

   This document deprecates the use of the AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET
   types of the AS_PATH in BGPv4.  This is done to simplify the design
   and implementation of the BGP protocol and to make the semantics of
   the originator of a route more clear.  This will also simplify the
   design, implementation and deployment of bonging work in the Secure
   Inter-Domain Routing Working Group.

Internet-Draft      AS_SET, AS_CONFED_SET deprecation       January 2011


1.  Introduction

   The AS_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH attribute ([RFC4271],
   Section 4.3) is created by a router that is performing route
   aggregation and contains an unordered set of ASs that the update has
   traversed.  The AS_CONFED_SET path segment type ([RFC5065]) of the
   AS_PATH attribute is created by a router that is performing route
   aggregation and contains an unordered set of Member AS Numbers in the
   local confederation that the update has traversed (AS_CONFED_SETs are
   very similar to AS_SETs, but are used within a confederation).

   By performing aggregation, a router is, in essence, combining
   multiple routes into a new route.  This type of aggregation blurs the
   semantics of what it means to originate a route.  These can cause
   operational issues that include reachability problems and traffic
   engineering issues.

   From analysis of past Internet routing data it is apparent that
   aggregation that involves AS_SETs is very seldom used in practice on
   the public network and, when it is, often contains reserved AS
   numbers ([RFC1930]) and / or only a single AS in the AS_SET.  The
   reduction in table size provided by the aggregation is outweighed by
   additional complexity in the BGP protocol and confusion regarding
   what exactly is meant by originating a route.


2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Deployment and modification of behavior

   Operators are strongly advised to not generate any new announcements
   containing AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs and to withdraw any existing
   routes containing them as soon as possible.  As with any change, the
   operator should understand the full implications of the change.

   It is worth noting that new technologies (such as those that take
   advantage of the "X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS
   Identifiers" ([RFC3779]) may not support routes with AS_SETs /
   AS_CONFED_SETs in them, and MAY treat as infeasible routes containing
   them.  Future BGP implementations may also do the same.

   It is expected that, even before the deployment of these
   technologies, operators may begin filtering routers that contain

   AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no IANA considerations.


5.  Security Considerations

   By removing support for the AS_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH
   attribute future BGP implementations can be simplified.  This will
   also simplify the design and implementation of the RPKI and systems
   that will rely on it.  By removing corner cases we remove complexity
   and code that is not exercised very often, which decreases the attack
   surface.
