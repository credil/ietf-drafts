Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP document process              April 2009


1.  Introduction

   When IETF and ITU-T entered into the agreement to develop MPLS-TP was
   agreed on - the JWT agreement - it was decided that the MPLS-TP
   documents should be developed "according to IETF processes".  It was
   also assumed that a close cooperation in reviewing these IETF
   documents.  The JWT decision is documented in RFC 5317 [RFC5317].

   However, the process for this close cooperative review was mostly
   left to be decided as the documents evolved.  The ITU-T committed to
   responding promptly to IETF working group last calls, this may
   require the development of the response via correspondence.

   This document complements the process as documented in the JWT
   decision with a couple of separate elements:

   o  An adaptation of the IETF working group process, with respect to
      the role of the teams (MPLS Interoperability Design Team (MEAD
      Team), the Joint Working Team (JWT) and the ITU-T MPLS-TP ad hoc
      team) that has been set up to facilitate the development of
      MPLS-TP; see Section 2.

   o  Identifies the expected participation by the ITU-T in the document
      development process; see Section 3.

   o  Clarification of the decision rules regarding MPLS-TP documents;
      see Section 4.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.1.  Terminology

   This section includes a number of terms and abbreviations that is
   used on this document.  The section is split into two subsection;
   IETF terms and ITU-T terms.

1.1.1.  IETF terms and abbreviations

   o  JWT - Joint Working Team, a team with participants with experience
      from standards development in the IETF and the ITU-T.

      Note: The JWT is not part of either the IETF or ITU-T, but a group
      that has been set up to facilitate cooperation on MPLS-TP between
      the two organizations.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP document process              April 2009


   o  JWT documents - the set of documents that were envisioned in the
      documentation of the JWT decision

   o  MEAD team - MPLS Interoperability Design Team, a temporary team
      with participants with experience from standards development for
      MPLS and transport networks.  The MEAD team is chartered to
      coordinated the development of MPLS-TP within the IETF and to
      coordinate the on MPLS-TP cooperation with the ITU-T.

   o  MPLS-TP documents - the following sets of documents are counted as
      MPLS-TP documents:

      *  Internet Drafts that are coordinated by the MEAD team.

      *  Individual Internet Drafts that addresses the MPLS-TP problem
         space.

      *  Working group Internet Drafts that addresses the MPLS-TP
         problem space.

      *  Internet Drafts that are considered for publication by the IESG
         and that addresses the MPLS-TP problem space.

      *  Internet Drafts that are approved for publication by the IESG
         and that addresses the MPLS-TP problem space.

      *  Published RFCs that addresses the MPLS-TP problem space.

      *  ITU-T Recommendations and draft Recommendations in various
         stages of development that addresses the MPLS-TP problem space.

   Documents that originates from the IRTF RFC stream is NOT considered
   as MPLS-TP documents.

1.1.2.  ITU-T terms and abbreviations

   o  Ad Hoc on MPLS-TP - A team established by SG 15 of ITU-T to
      coordinate the work on MPLS-TP within the ITU-T and to act as a
      focal point for communication with the IETF.

   o  Contribution - a contribution is a document that is submitted to
      the ITU-T to advance work on the development of a Recommendation
      or to propose the development of a new Recommendation.

   o  Recommendation - a Recommendation is the ITU-T standards document.

2.  Adaptation of the IETF working group process

   The IETF working group processes as defined in RFC 2026 [RFC2026] are
   for the purpose of the MPLS-TP updated as follows.

   IETF works according the the 'rough consensus' model where the
   working group chairs determines the consensus after discussions on
   the mailing lists.  This is applicable to the MPLS-TP work also.  The
   mpls-tp@ietf.org is the mailing list used to find out consensus and
   the consensus is decided by the MEAD team chair.  After a document
   has become a working group document the consensus is decided by the
   WG chairs and the MEAD team chair jointly.

   A most important part of this process is the information exchange
   between the IETF and ITU-T.  This information exchange consists of
   two equally important pieces:

   o  informal information exchange

      this is done primarily by mails to the relevant mailing lists.

   o  formal information exchange

      In addition to a mail to the relevant mailing lists, the formal
      information exchange is accompanied by a liaison between the two
      organisations.  Exchange of liaisons makes it possible to follow
      the request/response exchange between the organisations i n more
      detail.

   process

2.2.  The IETF MPLS-TP process

   This section gives guidelines for how the flow chart above could be
   traversed.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP document process              April 2009


2.2.1.  Developing a MPLS-TP document

   Individual MPLS-TP documents may take different paths through the
   this process, the numbers in the list below is mapped to the numbers
   in the flow chart above.

   Although the different paths through the flow chart is given as
   'options' it is always possible for the MEAD team to step in aand
   take over the shepherding af a particular document.  This is done in
   cooperation between the MEAD team chair, the relevant working group
   chairs and the document editors/authors.

   1.   They may be intended for and managed by a working group.

        This means that the author(s) of such a document has chosen to
        send the document to a working group instead of running through
        the MEAD team.  Normal IETF process will kick in in such cases
        and working group chairs will agree to which working group(s)
        such a document will be taken.

   2.   They may be coordinated by the MEAD team.

        This means that the author(s) of such a document has chosen to
        send the document to the MEAD team to be coordinated with the
        rest of the MPLS-TP documents that is in the purview of the MEAD
        team.

   3.   They may be originated by the MEAD team based on the jwt
        decision.

        The documentation of the work of the JWT, there is a proposed
        document structure.  The MEAD team used this structure to decide
        on a set of documents that will, when completed, constitute the
        MPLS-TP standard.  This set of documents are slightly changing,
        e.g. because it becomes more appropriate to split a single
        document into two or more, or if new aspects of MPLS-TP needs to
        be specified.

   4.   Everytime a document is accepted by the MEAD team into the set
        of documents coordinated by the MEAD team a liaison is sent to
        the ITU-T with a pointer to the document.  At the same time note
        is sent to the MPLS-TP ad hoc team mailing list informing that
        the document has become a MEAD team document.

        The ITU-T may chose to respond to the liaison but is not
        required to do so, see Section 3 and Section 4.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP document process              April 2009


   5.   At any time it is possible for the ITU-T SGs and Questions to
        send review comments on MEAD team documents.  It is also
        possible for the MEAD team to ask for such reviews and comments.

        Any time such an input or requests are sent between the two
        organizations it SHALL be accompanied by a note from the MPLS-TP
        ad hoc team chair(s) to the MEAD team mailing list, or from the
        MEAD team chair to the MPLS-TP ad hoc team mailing list.  This
        is done to enhance the efficiency of the information exchange.

   6.   A working group or the MEAD team may issue requests for general
        comments on MPLS-TP documents at any time, if it is deemed
        appropriate to extend these requests to the MPLS-TP ad hoc team
        this is done via a note according to entry (5) in this list.

   7.   If a MPLS-TP document is mature enough to become a working group
        document a poll is done on the mpls-tp mailing list and the
        appropriate wg mailing list, this request will also be sent to
        the ITU-T as a liaison.  A note will also be sent to the MPLS-TP
        ad hoc team.

        Which working group a document goes into is decided jointly
        between the MEAD team, working group chairs of the potential
        working groups and the document editors/authors.

        If the document is accepted as a working group document the
        working group takes over the revision control of the document.

        The ITU-T is expected to respond to the liaison within in the
        time indicated in the liaison, see Section 3 and Section 4.

   8.   Every time a MPLS-TP document is accepted as a working group
        document by any IETF working group a liaison is sent to the
        ITU-T with a pointer to the document.  At the same time note is
        sent to the MPLS-TP ad hoc team mailing list informing that the
        document has become a working group document.

   9.   Working group documents may be reviewed in several steps, every
        time such a review is initiated the MPLS-TP ad hoc team is
        notified (10).

        Note that most reviews that leads to updates of working group
        documents are spontaneous individual comments from participants
        in the MPLS-TP effort.

   10.  Every time a review is initiated by a working group the
        appropriate ITU-T SGs and Questions will be notified by a mail
        to the MPLS-TP ad hoc team.

        Optionally the request for review may be accompanied by a
        liaison to formalize the request.

        The MPLS-TP ad hoc team is responsible for ensuring that any
        e-mail requests are copied/forwarded the relevant SGs and
        Questions.

   11.  When a document is deemed to mature enough a working group last
        call is initiated.  At this time the action describe under item
        12 in this list MUST be executed.

   12.  Procedures to be followed when a working group last call is
        inititated.

        *  A liaison containing a request for participation in the
           working group last call will be sent to the appropriate ITU-T
           SG and Questions

        *  A mail with a notification that the working group lst call is
           taking place will be sent to the MPLS-TP ad hoc team.

        *  ITU-T is REQUIRED to respond to the liaison within the time
           indicated.  The MPLS-TP ad hoc team is expected to verify
           that all the SGs and Questions with the ITU-T that needs to
           respond to the working group last call are aware that it has
           been issued.

   13.  When all last call comments are addressed and responded the
        document will be sent to the ITU-T with a asking if the document
        are ready to be be sent to the IESG with a request for
        publication. published.for a acknowledment that the document is
        ready to or tht thre is further work that nees to be done. a
        request for publication will be sent to the IESG.  The document
        after this point in time handled as any other IETF document.

        Note: WG last call may be re-iterated, for the entire document
        or limited to only verify the updates made because of an earlier
        working group last call.

   14.  The ITU-T has one week to respond yes or no to the question
        posed in (13).

        The answer can be either "yes - go ahead", in which case the
        Working Group will request publication; or ...

        ... it can be "no - more work is needed", in which case it will
        go back into the normal working group process to identify what
        is needed.

   15.  When the ITU-T gives the final acknowledgement a request for
        piblication will be sent to the IESG.  Once this request for
        publication is sent to last point in this process where it is
        adopted to allow ITU-T influence the development of a document
        is paased.  After this the document will be handled as any other
        IETF document.

3.  Expectations on ITU-T participation in the process

   The IETF and ITU-T processes for the development of the MPLS-TP
   standards interconnect at the following point in the flow chart above
   (4), (5), (7a), (8), (10) and (12).  This section describes in short
   what is expected to happen on the ITU-T side at the interaction
   points.

3.1.  Becoming a MEAD team document

   (4) is a point where the MEAD team communicates to the ITU-T that a
   document is considered to be accepted to be coordinated by the MEAD
   team.

   The ITU-T is expected to respond to the communication with a simple
   ACK or NAK, however a non-response is counted as an ACK.

   An ACK means that ITU-T accepts that the documents has become a MEAD
   team document, a NAK means that ITU-T has issues that needs to be
   resolved before the document is allowed to progress.

3.2.  Comments on MEAD team documents by participants in the ITU-T

   (5) and (10) offers possibilities for ITU-T or people active in the
   ITU-T to send un-triggered comments on MEAD team or working group
   documents.  Such comments shall be sent to the mpls-tp list and for
   working group documents also to the appropriate working group mailing
   list.  Comments received in this way will be treated as the same way
   any as other individual comments received on the IETF documents.

3.3.  Poll for working group documents

   (7a) is the point where an IETF working group informs the ITU-T that
   a poll to progress a document to an IETF working group document has
   been started.

   It is not necessary or required for the ITU-T to respond to this
   message.  If the ITU-T has serious concerns these should be provided
   via a liaison statement.  If the ITU-T has no serious concerns it is
   allowed and encouraged that individual participants provide comments.
   Such responses shall be sent to the appropriate working group and
   mpls-tp mailing lists and represent the view of the person sending
   the mail.

   An Internet Draft is ready to become a working group draft if it
   meets at least the three criteria below.

   o  it is within the charter of the working group

   o  it addresses a problem that needs to be solved

   o  it is a good enough start to solve this problem

   Responses to polls for checking if a document is ready to become a
   working group document should be limited to answer if the document
   meets those three criteria.

3.4.  Responding to an IETF Working Group Last Call

   (12) is the point in the process where ITU-T is made aware of that an
   IETF working group last call has been started.  The working group
   last call is issued when a working group document is getting close to
   be ready for publication.  The intention is to make sure that there
   are no important pieces missing and that technical details are
   correct.

   According to the JWT decision ITU-T is required to respond to a
   working group last call within the time set for the working group
   last.

   The chair of an IETF working group that starts a working group last
   call will send a liaison to the ITU-T announcing the working group
   last call.  A message will also be sent to the MPLS-TP ad hoc team.
   The IETF will make a best effort to target the SGs and Questions that
   should be involved in responding to the working group last call.
   However, the ITU-T has to make sure that the appropriate entities
   within the ITU-T participate in responding to the working group last
   call.  The ITU-T MPLS-TP ad hoc team coordinates the development of
   the ITU-T response to the working group last call.

4.  Specific guidelines that apply to work on MPLS-TP in the ITU-T

   These guidelines apply to progressing work on MPLS-TP in the ITU-T.

      Any member of the ITU-T may send a MPLS-TP contribution to a ITU-T
      Study Group or Question.

      Before the ITU-T initiates any new work (i.e. items not previously
      identified by the JWT) based on such contributions the ITU-T shall
      send a liaison to the IETF.  The message will go to the MEAD team,
      the team is responsible for creating a consolidated IETF response.

      The IETF is expected to respond to the information that a new
      MPLS-TP work item has been proposed with an ACK or NAK.

      If the response is a NAK that work item is held until the issues
      is resolved.

   between IETF and ITU-T and thus does not introduce any new security
   considerations.
