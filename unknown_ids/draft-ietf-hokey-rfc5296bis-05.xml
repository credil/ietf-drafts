      <t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic framework
      supporting multiple types of authentication methods. In systems where
      EAP is used for authentication, it is desirable to avoid repeating the entire
      EAP exchange with another authenticator. This document specifies
      extensions to EAP and the EAP keying hierarchy to support an EAP
      method-independent protocol for efficient re-authentication between the
      peer and an EAP re-authentication server through any authenticator. The
      re-authentication server may be in the home network or in the local
      network to which the peer is connecting.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a an authentication
      framework that supports multiple authentication methods. The primary
      purpose is network access authentication, and a key-generating method is
      used when the lower layer wants to enforce access control. The EAP
      keying hierarchy defines two keys to be derived by all key-generating
      EAP methods: the Master Session Key (MSK) and the Extended MSK (EMSK).
      In the most common deployment scenario, an EAP peer and an EAP server
      authenticate each other through a third party known as the EAP
      authenticator. The EAP authenticator or an entity controlled by the EAP
      authenticator enforces access control. After successful authentication,
      the EAP server transports the MSK to the EAP authenticator; the EAP
      authenticator and the EAP peer establish transient session keys (TSKs)
      using the MSK as the authentication key, key derivation key, or a key
      transport key, and use the TSK for per-packet access enforcement.</t>

      <t>When a peer moves from one authenticator to another, it is desirable
      to avoid a full EAP authentication to support fast handovers. The full
      EAP exchange with another run of the EAP method can take several round
      trips and significant time to complete, causing increased handover
      times. Some EAP methods specify the use of state from the initial
      authentication to optimize re-authentications by reducing the
      computational overhead (e.g., EAP-AKA <xref target="RFC4187"></xref>), but 
      method-specific re-authentication takes at
      least 2 round trips with the original EAP server in most cases. It is also important to note that
      several methods do not offer support for re-authentication.</t>

      <t>Key sharing across authenticators is sometimes used as a practical
      solution to lower handover times. In that case, however, the compromise of one
      authenticator results in the compromise of keying material established via
      other authenticators. Other solutions for fast re-authentication exist
      in the literature: for example, see Lopez, et al. <xref target="MSKHierarchy"></xref>;
      Clancy, et al. have described the EAP
      re-authentication problem statement in detail
       <xref target="RFC5169"></xref>.
      </t>

      <t>In conclusion, to achieve low latency handovers, there is a need for
      a method-independent re-authentication protocol that completes in less
      than 2 round trips, preferably with a local server. 
      </t>

      <t>This document specifies EAP Re-authentication Extensions (ERXs) for
      efficient re-authentication using EAP. The protocol that uses these
      extensions is itself referred to as the EAP Re-authentication Protocol
      (ERP). It supports EAP method-independent re-authentication for a peer
      that has valid, unexpired key material from a previously performed EAP
      authentication. The protocol and the key hierarchy required for EAP
      re-authentication are described in this document.</t>

      <t>
      Note that to support ERP, lower-layer specifications may need to be
      revised to allow carrying EAP messages that have a code value higher
      than 4 and to accommodate the peer-initiated nature of ERP.
      Specifically, the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol <xref target="RFC5996"></xref> 
      must be updated to carry ERP messages;
      work is in progress on this project 
      <xref target="I-D.nir-ipsecme-erx"/>.

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document uses the basic EAP terminology <xref
      target="RFC3748"></xref> and EMSK keying hierarchy terminology <xref
      target="RFC5295"></xref>. In addition, this document uses the following
      terms:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t>ER Peer - An EAP peer that supports the EAP Re-authentication
          Protocol. All references to "peer" in this document imply an ER
          peer, unless specifically noted otherwise.</t>

          <t>ER Authenticator - An entity that supports the authenticator
          functionality for EAP re-authentication described in this document.
          All references to "authenticator" in this document imply an ER
          authenticator, unless specifically noted otherwise.</t>

          <t>ER Server - An entity that performs the server portion of ERP
          described here. This entity may or may not be an EAP server. All
          references to "server" in this document imply an ER server, unless
          specifically noted otherwise. An ER server is a logical entity; it
          may not necessarily be co-located with, or physically part of, a
          full EAP server.</t>

          <t>ERX - EAP re-authentication extensions.</t>

          <t>ERP - EAP Re-authentication Protocol that uses the
          re-authentication extensions.</t>

          <t>rRK - re-authentication Root Key, derived from the EMSK or
          DSRK.</t>

          <t>rIK - re-authentication Integrity Key, derived from the rRK.</t>

          <t>rMSK - re-authentication MSK. This is a per-authenticator key,
          derived from the rRK.</t>

          <t>keyName-NAI - ERP messages are integrity protected with the rIK
          or the DS-rIK. The use of rIK or DS-rIK for integrity protection of
          ERP messages is indicated by the EMSKname <xref
          target="RFC5295"></xref>; the protocol, which is ERP; and the realm,
          which indicates the domain name of the ER server. The EMSKname is
          copied into the username part of the NAI.</t>

          <t>Domain - Refers to a "key management domain" as defined in <xref
          target="RFC5295"></xref>. For simplicity, it is referred to as
          "domain" in this document. The terms "home domain" and "local
          domain" are used to differentiate between the originating key
          management domain that performs the full EAP exchange with the peer
          and the local domain to which a peer may be attached at a given
          time.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="overview" title="ERP Description">
      <t>ERP allows a peer and server to mutually verify proof of possession
      of keying material from an earlier EAP method run and to establish a
      security association between the peer and the authenticator. The
      authenticator acts as a pass-through entity for the Re-authentication
      Protocol in a manner similar to that of an EAP authenticator described
      in RFC 3748 <xref target="RFC3748"></xref>. ERP is a single round-trip
      exchange between the peer and the server; it is independent of the lower
      layer and the EAP method used during the full EAP exchange. The ER
      server may be in the home domain or in the same (visited) domain as the
      peer and the authenticator (i.e., the local domain).</t>

      <t><xref target="erp_fig"></xref> shows the protocol exchange. The first
      time the peer attaches to any network, it performs a full EAP exchange
      (shown in <xref target="eap_fig"></xref>) with the EAP server; as a
      result, an MSK is distributed to the EAP authenticator. The MSK is then
      used by the authenticator and the peer to establish TSKs as needed. At
      the time of the initial EAP exchange, the peer and the server also
      derive an EMSK, which is used to derive a re-authentication Root Key
      (rRK). More precisely, a re-authentication Root Key is derived from the
      EMSK or from a Domain-Specific Root Key (DSRK), which is itself derived
      from the EMSK. The rRK is only available to the peer and the ER server
      and is never handed out to any other entity. Further, a
      re-authentication Integrity Key (rIK) is derived from the rRK; the peer
      and the ER server use the rIK to provide proof of possession while
      performing an ERP exchange. The rIK is also never handed out to any
      entity and is only available to the peer and server.</t>

      <t>Two new EAP codes, EAP-Initiate and EAP-Finish, are specified in this
      document for the purpose of EAP re-authentication. When the peer
      identifies a target authenticator that supports EAP re-authentication,
      it performs an ERP exchange, as shown in <xref target="erp_fig"></xref>;
      the exchange itself may happen when the peer attaches to a new
      authenticator supporting EAP re-authentication, or prior to attachment.
      The peer initiates ERP by itself; it may also do so in response to an
      EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message from the new authenticator. The
      EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message allows the authenticator to trigger
      the ERP exchange. The EAP-Finish message also can be used by the
      authenticator to announce the local domain name.</t>

      <t>It is plausible that the authenticator does not know whether the peer
      supports ERP and whether the peer has performed a full EAP
      authentication through another authenticator. The authenticator MAY
      initiate the ERP exchange by sending the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start
      message, and if there is no response, send the
      EAP-Request/Identity message. Note that this avoids having two EAP
      messages in flight at the same time <xref target="RFC3748"></xref>. The
      authenticator may send the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message and wait
      for a short, locally configured amount of time. This message indicates to the peer that the authenticator
      supports ERP. In response to this trigger from the authenticator, the
      peer can initiate the ERP exchange by sending an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth
      message. If there is no response from the peer after the necessary number of
      retransmissions (see <xref target="lowerlayer"></xref>), the
      authenticator MUST initiate EAP by sending an EAP-Request message,
      typically the EAP-Request/Identity message. Note that the authenticator
      may receive an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message after it has sent an
      EAP-Request/Identity message. If the authenticator supports ERP, it MUST
      proceed with the ERP exchange. When the EAP-Request/Identity times out,
      the authenticator MUST NOT close the connection if an ERP exchange is in
      progress or has already succeeded in establishing a re-authentication
      MSK.</t>

      <t>If the authenticator does not support ERP, it will silently discard
      EAP-Initiate/Re-auth messages (<xref target="ReauthInit"></xref>) since the EAP
      code of those packets is greater than 4 (<xref target="RFC3748"/>, Section 4).
      An ERP-capable peer will
      exhaust the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message retransmissions and fall back
      to EAP authentication by responding to EAP Request/Identity messages
      from the authenticator.
      If the peer does not support ERP or if it does
      not have unexpired key material from a previous EAP authentication, it
      drops EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start messages. If there is no response to
      the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message, the authenticator SHALL send an
      EAP Request message (typically EAP Request/Identity) to start EAP
      authentication. From this point onward, RFC 3748 rules apply. Note that
      this may introduce some delay in starting EAP. In some lower layers, the
      delay can be minimized or even avoided by the peer initiating EAP by
      sending messages such as EAPoL-Start
      <xref target="IEEE_802.1X"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The peer sends an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message that contains the
      keyName-NAI to identify the ER server's domain and the rIK used to
      protect the message, and a sequence number for replay protection. The
      EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message is integrity protected with the rIK. The
      authenticator uses the realm in the keyName-NAI <xref
      target="RFC4282"></xref> field to send the message to the appropriate ER
      server. The server uses the keyName to look up the rIK. The server,
      after verifying proof of possession of the rIK, and freshness of the
      message, derives a re-authentication MSK (rMSK) from the rRK using the
      sequence number as an input to the key derivation. The server then updates
      the expected sequence number to the received sequence number plus
      one.</t>

      <t>In response to the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message, the server sends an
      EAP-Finish/Re-auth message; this message is integrity protected with the
      rIK. The server transports the rMSK along with this message to the
      authenticator. The rMSK is transported in a manner similar to that of
      the MSK along with the EAP-Success message in a full EAP exchange.
      Hoeper, et al.<xref target="RFC5749"></xref> discuss an additional
      key distribution protocol that can be used to transport the rRK from an
      EAP server to one of many different ER servers that share a trust
      relationship with the EAP server.</t>

      <t>The peer MAY request the rMSK lifetime from the server. If so, the ER
      server sends the rMSK lifetime in the EAP-Finish/Re-auth message.</t>

      <t>In an ERP bootstrap exchange, the peer MAY ask the server for the
      rRK lifetime. If so, the ER server sends the rRK lifetime in the
      EAP-Finish/Re-auth message.</t>

      <t>The peer verifies the sequence number and the integrity of the
      message. It then uses the sequence number in the EAP-Finish/Re-auth
      message to compute the rMSK. The lower-layer security association
      protocol is ready to be triggered after this point.</t>

      <t>The ER server is located either in the home domain or in the visited
      domain. When the ER server is in the home domain and there is no local
      ER server in the visited domain, the peer and the server use the rIK and
      rRK derived from the EMSK; and when the ER server is in the local
      domain, they use the DS-rIK and DS-rRK corresponding to the local
      domain. The domain of the ER server is identified by the realm portion
      of the keyname-NAI in ERP messages. </t>

      <section title="ERP With the Home ER Server">
        <t>If the peer is in the home domain or there is no local server
        in the same domain as the peer, it SHOULD initiate an ERP bootstrap
        exchange with the home ER server to obtain the domain name. </t>

        <t>The defined ER extensions allow the execution of ERP with an ER server
        in the local domain (access network) if the peer moves out of home
        domain and a local ER server is present in the visited domain. The
        local ER server may be co-located with a local AAA server. The peer
        may learn about the presence of a local ER server in the network and
        the local domain name (or ER server name) either via a lower layer advertisement
        or by means of ERP exchange. The peer uses the domain name and the
        EMSK to compute the DSRK and from that key, the DS-rRK; the peer also
        uses the domain name in the realm portion of the keyName-NAI for using
        ERP in the local domain. <xref target="local_erp_fig_init"></xref>

        <t>As shown in <xref target="local_erp_fig_init"></xref>, the local ER
        server may be present in the path of the full EAP exchange (e.g., this
        may be one of the AAA entities, such as AAA proxies, in the path
        between the EAP authenticator and the home EAP server of the peer). In
        that case, the local ER server requests the DSRK by sending the domain
        name to the home EAP server by means of an AAA message. In response, the home
        EAP server computes the DSRK by following the procedure specified in
        <xref target="RFC5295"></xref> and sends the DSRK and the key name,
        EMSKname, to the ER server in the claimed domain (i.e., the local ER
        Server). The local domain is responsible for announcing that same
        domain name to the peer via a lower layer (for example, through DHCP-based local
        domain name discovery <xref target="I-D.ietf-hokey-ldn-discovery"></xref>, or through the
        EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message with the local ER
        server.</t>

        <t>After receiving the DSRK and the EMSKname, the local ER server
        computes the DS-rRK and the DS-rIK from the DSRK as defined in
        Sections <xref format="counter" target="rRKderv"></xref> and <xref
        format="counter" target="rIKderv"></xref> below. After receiving the
        domain name, the peer also derives the DSRK, the DS-rRK, and the
        DS-rIK. These keys are referred to by a keyName-NAI formed as follows:
        the username part of the NAI is the EMSKname, the realm portion of the
        NAI is the domain name. Both parties also maintain a sequence number
        (initialized to zero) corresponding to the specific keyName-NAI.</t>

        <t>If the peer subsequently attaches to an authenticator within the
        local domain, it may perform an ERP exchange with the local ER server
        to obtain a rMSK for the new authenticator. The ERP with the local ER
        Server is similar to ERP exchange illustrated in <xref
        target="erp_fig"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="eap_er_kh" title="ER Key Hierarchy">
      <t>Each time the peer re-authenticates to the network, the peer and the
      authenticator establish an rMSK. The rMSK serves the same purposes that
      an MSK, which is the result of full EAP authentication, serves. To prove
      possession of the rRK, we specify the derivation of another key, the
      rIK. These keys are derived from the rRK. Together they constitute the
      ER key hierarchy.</t>

      <t>The rRK is derived from either the EMSK or a DSRK as specified in
      <xref target="rRKderv"></xref>. For the purpose of rRK derivation, this
      document specifies derivation of a Usage-Specific Root Key (USRK) or a
      Domain-Specific USRK (DSUSRK) <xref target="RFC5295"></xref> 
      for re-authentication. The USRK designated for
      re-authentication is the re-authentication root key (rRK). A DSUSRK
      designated for re-authentication is the DS-rRK available to a local ER
      server in a particular domain. For simplicity, the keys are referred to
      without the DS label in the rest of the document. However, the scope of
      the various keys is limited to just the respective domains for which they are
      derived, in the case of the domain specific keys. Based on the ER
      server with which the peer performs the ERP exchange, it knows the
      corresponding keys that must be used.</t>

      <t>The rRK is used to derive an rIK, and rMSKs for one or more
      authenticators. The figure below shows the key hierarchy with the rRK,
      rIK, and rMSKs. <figure anchor="rRK_fig"

      <section title="rIK Usage">
        <t>The rIK is the key the possession of which is demonstrated by the peer and
        the ERP server to the other party. The peer demonstrates possession of
        the rIK by computing the integrity checksum over the
        EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message. When the peer uses the rIK for the first
        time, it can choose the integrity algorithm to use with the rIK. The
        peer and the server MUST use the same integrity algorithm with a given
        rIK for all ERP messages protected with that key. The peer and the
        server store the algorithm information after the first use, and they
        employ the same algorithm for all subsequent uses of that rIK.</t>

        <t>If the server's policy does not allow the use of the cryptosuite
        selected by the peer, the server SHALL reject the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth
        message and SHOULD send a list of acceptable cryptosuites in the
        EAP-Finish/Re-auth message.</t>

        <t>The rIK length may be different from the key length required by an
        integrity algorithm. In case of hash-based MAC algorithms, the key is
        first hashed to the required key length using the HMAC algorithm <xref
        target="RFC2104">RFC 2104</xref>. In case of cipher-based MAC algorithms, if
        the required key length is less than 32 octets, the rIK is hashed
        using HMAC-SHA256 and the first k octets of the output are used, where
        k is the key length required by the algorithm. If the required key
        length is more than 32 octets, the first k octets of the rIK are used
        by the cipher-based MAC algorithm.</t>

    <section title="Protocol Details">
      <section anchor="ERP-boot" title="ERP Bootstrapping">
        <t>We identify two types of bootstrapping for ERP: explicit and
        implicit. In implicit bootstrapping, the ER-capable
        authenticator or local ER server MUST verify whether it has valid rMSK
        or rRK corresponding to the peer. If ER capable authenticator or the
        local ER server has the key materials corresponding to the peer, it
        MUST be able to respond directly in the same way as the home AAA
        server does without forwarding the DSRK request to the home domain; if
        not, the ER-capable authenticator or local ER server SHOULD include
        its domain name in the AAA message encapsulating the first EAP
        Response message sent by the peer and request the DSRK from the home
        EAP server during the initial EAP exchange.
        If such EAP exchange is
        successful, the home EAP server sends the DSRK for the specified local
        AAA client or agent (derived using the EMSK and the domain name as
        specified in RFC 5295), EMSKname, and DSRK
        lifetime along with the EAP-Success message. The local AAA client or
        agent MUST extract the DSRK, EMSKname, and DSRK lifetime (if present)
        before forwarding the EAP-Success message to the peer. Note that the MSK (also
        present with the EAP Success message) is extracted by the EAP
        authenticator as usual. The peer learns the domain name through the
        EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message or by means of lower-layer announcement (for example, DHCP <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-hokey-ldn-discovery"></xref>). When the domain name
        is available to the peer during or after the full EAP authentication,
        it attempts to use ERP when it associates with a new authenticator.
        </t>

        <t>If the peer knows there is no local ER server presented in the
        visited domain, it SHOULD initiate Explicit ERP bootstrapping (ERP
        exchange with the bootstrap flag turned on) with the home ER server to
        obtain the rRK. The peer MAY also initiate bootstrapping to fetch
        information such as the rRK lifetime from the AAA server. </t>

        <t>The following steps describe the ERP Explicit Bootstrapping
        process: <list style="symbols">
            <t>The peer sends the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message with the
            bootstrapping flag set (1). The bootstrap message is always sent
            to the home ER server, and the keyname-NAI attribute in the
            bootstrap message is constructed as follows: the username portion
            of the NAI contains the EMSKname, and the realm portion contains
            the home domain name. </t>

            <t>In addition, the message MUST contain a sequence number for
            replay protection, a cryptosuite, and an integrity checksum. The
            cryptosuite indicates the authentication algorithm. The integrity
            checksum indicates that the message originated at the claimed
            entity, the peer indicated by the Peer-ID, or the rIKname.</t>

            <t>The peer MAY additionally set the lifetime flag to request the
            key lifetimes.</t>

            <t>Upon receipt of the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message from a peer,
            the ERP-capable authenticator verifies whether it has the local domain
            name and valid key materials corresponding to the peer. If it
            knows the local domain name and has valid key material corresponding to
            the peer, it MUST be able to respond directly in the same way as
            the home ER does with local domain name included. If not, it
            copies the contents of the keyName-NAI into the appropriate AAA
            attribute and may include
            its domain name in the AAA message encapsulating the
            EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message sent by the peer. </t>

            <t>Upon receipt of an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message, the home ER
            server verifies whether the message is fresh or is a replay by
            evaluating whether the received sequence number is equal to or
            greater than the expected sequence number for that rIK. The home
            ER server then verifies that the cryptosuite used by the
            peer is acceptable. Next, it verifies the integrity of
            the message by looking up the rIK and checking integrity checksum contained in the Authentication Tag field. 
            If any of the checks fail, the
            home ER server sends an EAP-Finish/Re-auth message with the Result
            flag set to '1'. Please refer to <xref target="fail"></xref> for
            details on failure handling. This error MUST NOT have any
            correlation to any EAP-Success message that may have been received
            by the EAP authenticator and the peer earlier. If the
            EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message is well-formed and valid, the server
            prepares the EAP-Finish/Re-auth message. The bootstrap flag MUST
            be set to indicate that this is a bootstrapping exchange. The
            message contains the following fields: <list style="symbols">
                <t>A sequence number for replay protection.</t>

                <t>The same keyName-NAI as in the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth
                message.</t>

                <t>If the lifetime flag was set in the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth
                message, the ER server SHOULD include the rRK lifetime and the
                rMSK lifetime in the EAP-Finish/Re-auth message. The server
                may have a local policy for the network to maintain and
                enforce lifetime unilaterally. In such cases, the server need
                not respond to the peer's request for the lifetime.</t>

                <t>If the bootstrap flag is set, the ER server MUST include

                EAP-Finish/Re-auth message.</t>

                <t>If the ER server verifies the authorization of a local ER
                server, it MAY include the Authorization Indication TLV to
                indicate to the peer that the server that received the DSRK
                and that is advertising the domain included in the domain name
                TLV is authorized.</t>

                <t>An authentication tag MUST be included to prove that the
                EAP-Finish/Re-auth message originates at a server that
                possesses the rIK corresponding to the EMSKname-NAI.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t> If the home ER server gets involved in ERP exchange and the
            ERP exchange is successful, the home ER server SHOULD request the
            DSRK from the home EAP server; the home EAP server
            MUST provide the DSRK for the home ER server (derived using the
            EMSK and the domain name as specified in RFC 5295), EMSKname, and DSRK lifetime for inclusion in 
            the AAA message. The home ER server SHOULD obtain them before
            sending the EAP-Finish/Re-auth message. </t>

            <t>In addition, the rMSK is sent along with the EAP-Finish/Re-auth
            message in a AAA attribute (for an example, see Bournelle, et al.<xref
            target="I-D.ietf-dime-erp"></xref>.</t>

            <t>The authenticator receives the rMSK.</t>

            <t>When the peer receives an EAP-Finish/Re-auth message with the
            bootstrap flag set, if a local domain name is present, it MUST use
            that to derive the appropriate DSRK, DS-rRK, DS-rIK, and
            keyName-NAI, and initialize the replay counter for the DS-rIK. If
            not, the peer SHOULD derive the domain-specific keys using the
            domain name it learned via the lower layer or from the
            EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message. If the peer does not know the
            domain name, it must assume that there is no local ER server
            available.</t>

            <t>The peer MAY also verify the Authorization Indication TLV.</t>

        <t>Since the ER bootstrapping exchange is typically done immediately
        following the full EAP exchange, it is feasible that the process is
        completed through the same entity that served as the EAP authenticator
        for the full EAP exchange. In this case, the lower layer may already
        have established TSKs based on the MSK received earlier. The lower
        layer may then choose to ignore the rMSK that was received with the ER
        bootstrapping exchange. Alternatively, the lower layer may choose to
        establish a new TSK using the rMSK. In either case, the authenticator
        and the peer know which key is used based on whether or not a TSK
        establishment exchange is initiated. The bootstrapping exchange may
        also be carried out via a new authenticator, in which case, the rMSK
        received SHOULD trigger a lower layer TSK establishment exchange.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Steps in ERP">
        <t>When a peer that has an active rRK and rIK associates with a new
        authenticator that supports ERP, it may perform an ERP exchange with
        that authenticator. ERP is typically a peer-initiated exchange,
        consisting of an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth and an EAP-Finish/Re-auth
        message. The ERP exchange may be performed with a local ER server
        (when one is present) or with the original EAP server.</t>

        <t>It is plausible for the network to trigger the EAP
        re-authentication process, however. An ERP-capable authenticator
        SHOULD send an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message to indicate support
        for ERP. The peer may or may not wait for these messages to arrive to
        initiate the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message.</t>

        <t>The EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message SHOULD be sent by an
        ERP-capable authenticator. The authenticator may retransmit it a few
        times until it receives an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message in response
        from the peer. The EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message from the peer may have
        originated before the peer receives either an EAP-Request/Identity or
        an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message from the authenticator. Hence,
        the Identifier value in the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message is
        independent of the Identifier value in the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start
        or the EAP-Request/Identity messages.</t>

        <t>Operational Considerations at the Peer:</t>

        <t>ERP requires that the peer maintain retransmission timers for
        reliable transport of EAP re-authentication messages. The reliability
        considerations of Section 4.3 of RFC 3748 apply with the peer as the
        retransmitting entity.</t>

        <t>The EAP Re-auth Protocol has the following steps:<list>
            <t>The ERP-capable authenticator sends the
            EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message to trigger the ERP
            exchange.</t>

            <t>The peer sends an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message. At a minimum,
            the message SHALL include the following fields: <list>
                <t>a 16-bit sequence number for replay protection</t>

                <t>keyName-NAI as a TLV attribute to identify the rIK used to
                integrity protect the message.</t>

                <t>cryptosuite to indicate the authentication algorithm used
                to compute the integrity checksum.</t>

                <t>Authentication Tag computed over the message.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>When the peer is performing ERP with a local ER server, it MUST
            use the corresponding DS-rIK it shares with the local ER server.
            The peer SHOULD set the lifetime flag to request the key lifetimes
            from the server. The peer can use the rRK lifetime to know when to
            trigger an EAP method exchange and the rMSK lifetime to know when
            to trigger another ERP exchange.</t>

            <t>The authenticator copies the contents of the value field of the
            keyName-NAI TLV into an appropriate attribute (e.g, User-Name <xref target="RFC2865"/>)
            in the AAA
            message to the ER server.</t>

            <t>The ER server uses the keyName-NAI to look up the rIK. It MUST
            first verify whether the sequence number is equal to or greater
            than the expected sequence number. If the ER server supports a
            sequence number window size greater than 1, it MUST verify whether
            the sequence number falls within the window and has not been
            received before. The ER server MUST then verify that the
            cryptosuite used by the peer is acceptable. The ER server then
            proceeds to verify the integrity of the message using the rIK,
            thereby verifying proof of possession of that key by the peer. If
            any of these verifications fail, the ER server MUST send an
            EAP-Finish/Re-auth message with the Result flag set to '1'
            (Failure). Please refer to <xref target="fail"></xref> for details
            on failure handling. Otherwise, it MUST compute an rMSK from the
            rRK using the sequence number as the additional input to the key
            derivation.</t>

            <t>In response to a well-formed EAP Re-auth/Initiate message, the
            ER server MUST send an EAP-Finish/Re-auth message with the
            following contents: <list>
                <t>a 16-bit sequence number for replay protection, which MUST
                be the same as the received sequence number. The local copy of
                the sequence number MUST be incremented by 1. If the ER server
                supports multiple simultaneous ERP exchanges, it MUST instead
                update the sequence number window.</t>

                <t>keyName-NAI as a TLV attribute to identify the rIK used to
                integrity protect the message.</t>

                <t>cryptosuite to indicate the authentication algorithm used
                to compute the integrity checksum.</t>

                <t>Authentication Tag over the message.</t>

                <t>If the lifetime flag was set in the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth
                message, the ER server SHOULD include the rRK lifetime and the
                rMSK lifetime.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>The ER server causes the rMSK along with this message to to be transported to
            the authenticator. The rMSK is transported in a manner similar to
            the MSK and the EAP-Success message in a regular
            EAP exchange.</t>

            <t>The peer looks up the sequence number to verify whether it is
            expecting an EAP-Finish/Re-auth message with that sequence number
            protected by the keyName-NAI. It then verifies the integrity of
            the message. If the verifications fail, the peer logs an error and
            stops the process; otherwise, it proceeds to the next step.</t>

            <t>The peer uses the sequence number to compute the rMSK.</t>

            <t>The lower-layer security association protocol can be triggered
            at this point.</t>
          </list></t>

        <section anchor="window" title="Multiple Simultaneous Runs of ERP">
          <t>When a peer is within the range of multiple authenticators, it
          may choose to run ERP via all of them simultaneously to the same ER
          server. In that case, it is plausible that the ERP messages may
          arrive out of order, resulting in the ER server rejecting legitimate
          EAP-Initiate/Re-auth messages.</t>

          <t>To facilitate such operation, an ER server MAY allow multiple
          simultaneous ERP exchanges by accepting all EAP-Initiate/Re-auth
          messages with SEQ number values within a window of allowed values.
          Recall that the SEQ number allows replay protection. Replay window
          maintenance mechanisms are a local matter.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="fail" title="ERP Failure Handling">
          <t>If the processing of the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message results in
          a failure, the ER server MUST send an EAP-Finish Re-auth message
          with the Result flag set to '1'. If the server has a valid rIK for
          the peer, it MUST integrity protect the EAP-Finish/Re-auth failure
          message. If the failure is due to an unacceptable cryptosuite, the
          server SHOULD send a list of acceptable cryptosuites (in a TLV of
          Type 5) along with the EAP-Finish/Re-auth message. In this case, the
          server MUST indicate the cryptosuite used to protect the
          EAP-Finish/Re-auth message in the cryptosuite. The rIK used with the
          EAP-Finish/Re-auth message in this case MUST be computed as
          specified in <xref target="rIKderv"></xref> using the new
          cryptosuite. If the server does not have a valid rIK for the peer,
          the EAP-Finish/Re-auth message indicating a failure will be
          unauthenticated; the server MAY include a list of acceptable
          cryptosuites in the message.</t>

          <t>The peer, upon receiving an EAP-Finish/Re-auth message with the
          Result flag set to '1', MUST verify the sequence number and, if possible, the
          Authentication Tag to determine the validity of the message. If the
          peer supports the cryptosuite, it MUST verify the integrity of the
          received EAP-Finish/Re-auth message. If the EAP-Finish message
          contains a TLV of Type 5, the peer SHOULD retry the ERP exchange
          with a cryptosuite picked from the list included by the server. The
          peer MUST use the appropriate rIK for the subsequent ERP exchange,
          by computing it with the corresponding cryptosuite, as specified in
          <xref target="rIKderv"></xref>. If the PRF in the chosen cryptosuite
          is different from the PRF originally used by the peer, it MUST
          derive a new DSRK (if required), rRK, and rIK before proceeding with
          the subsequent ERP exchange.</t>

          <t>If the peer cannot verify the integrity of the received message,
          it MAY choose to retry the ERP exchange with one of the cryptosuites
          in the List of cryptosuites TLV, after a failure has been clearly determined
          following the procedure in the next paragraph.</t>

          <t>If the replay or integrity checks fail, the failure message may
          have been sent by an attacker. It may also mean that the server and
          peer do not support the same cryptosuites; however, the peer cannot
          determine if that is the case. Hence, the peer SHOULD continue the
          ERP exchange per the retransmission timers before declaring a
          failure.</t>

          <t>When the peer runs explicit bootstrapping (ERP with the
          bootstrapping flag on), there may not be a local ER server available
          to send a DSRK Request and the domain name. In that case, the server
          cannot send the DSRK and MUST NOT include the domain name TLV. When
          the peer receives a response in the bootstrapping exchange without a
          domain name TLV, it assumes that there is no local ER server. The
          home ER server sends an rMSK to the ER authenticator, however, and
          the peer SHALL run the TSK establishment protocol as usual.</t>

            SHOULD send the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message to indicate
            support for ERP to the peer and to initiate ERP if the peer has
            already performed full EAP authentication and has unexpired key
            material. The authenticator SHOULD include the Domain-Name TLV to
            allow the peer to learn it without requiring either lower-layer support or the ERP
            bootstrapping exchange.</t>

            <t>The authenticator MAY include channel binding information so

            value or if the peer has already sent the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message to

            EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message to start an ERP exchange with the
            local ER server. If there is a local ER server between the peer
            and the home ER server and the peer has already initiated an ERP

      <section title="Replay Protection">
        <t>For replay protection, ERP uses sequence numbers. The sequence
        number is maintained on a per rIK basis and is initialized to zero in both
        directions. In the first EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message, the peer uses
        a sequence number value of zero or higher. Note that the when the sequence
        number wraps back to zero, the rIK MUST be changed by running a full EAP authentication.
        The server expects a sequence number of zero or higher. When the
        server receives an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message, it uses the same
        sequence number in the EAP-Finish/Re-auth message. The server then
        sets the expected sequence number to the received sequence number plus
        1. The server MUST accept sequence numbers greater than or equal to the
        expected sequence number.</t>

        <t>If the peer sends an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message, but does not
        receive a response, it retransmits the request (with no changes to the
        message itself) a pre-configured number of times before giving up.
        However, it is plausible that the server itself may have responded to
        the message and the response was lost in transit. Thus, the peer MUST increment
        the sequence number and use the new sequence number to send subsequent
        EAP re-authentication messages. The peer SHOULD increment the sequence
        number by 1; however, it may choose to increment by a larger number.
        If the sequence number wraps back to zero, the peer MUST run full EAP
        authentication.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="CB" title="Channel Binding">
        <t>ERP provides a protected facility to carry channel binding (CB)
        information, according to the guidelines provided by Aboba, et al. (see Section 7.15 of <xref
        target="RFC3748"></xref>). The TLV type range of 128-191 is reserved to
        carry CB information in the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth and
        EAP-Finish/Re-auth messages. Called-Station-Id, Calling-Station-Id,
        NAS-Identifier, NAS-IP-Address, and NAS-IPv6-Address are some examples
        of channel binding information listed in RFC 3748, and they are
        assigned values 128-132. Additional values are IANA managed based on
        IETF Consensus <xref target="RFC5226"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The authenticator MAY provide CB information to the peer via the
        EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message. The peer sends the information to
        the server in the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message; the server verifies
        whether the authenticator identity available via AAA attributes is the
        same as the identity provided to the peer.</t>

        <t>If the peer does not include the CB information in the
        EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message, and if the local ER server's policy
        requires channel binding support, it SHALL send the CB attributes for
        the peer's verification. The peer attempts to verify the CB
        information if the authenticator has sent the CB parameters, and it
        proceeds with the lower-layer security association establishment if
        the attributes match. Otherwise, the peer SHALL NOT proceed with the
        lower-layer security association establishment.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="lowerlayer" title="Lower-Layer Considerations">
      <t>The authenticator is responsible for retransmission of
      EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start messages. The authenticator MAY retransmit
      the message a few times or until it receives an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth
      message from the peer. 
      The authenticator might not know if the peer
      supports ERP; in those cases, the peer could be silently discarding the
      EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start packets. Thus, retransmission of these
      packets should be kept to a minimum. The exact number is up to each
      lower layer.</t>

      <t>The Identifier value in the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth packet is
      independent of the Identifier value in the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start
      packet.</t>

      <t>The peer is responsible for retransmission of EAP-Initiate/Re-auth
      messages.</t>

      <t>Retransmitted packets MUST be sent with the same Identifier value in
      order to distinguish them from new packets. By default, where the
      EAP-Initiate message is sent over an unreliable lower layer, the
      retransmission timer SHOULD be dynamically estimated. A maximum of 3-5
      retransmissions is suggested 
      <xref target="RFC3748"></xref>. 
      Where the EAP-Initiate message is sent
      over a reliable lower layer, the retransmission timer SHOULD be set to
      an infinite value, so that retransmissions do not occur at the EAP
      layer. Please refer to RFC 3748 for
      additional guidance on setting timers.</t>

      <t>The Identifier value in the EAP-Finish/Re-auth packet is the same as
      the Identifier value in the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth packet.</t>

      <t>If an authenticator receives a valid duplicate EAP-Initiate/Re-auth
      message for which it has already sent an EAP-Finish/Re-auth message, it
      MUST resend the EAP-Finish/Re-auth message without reprocessing the
      EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message. To facilitate this, the authenticator
      SHALL store a copy of the EAP-Finish/Re-auth message for a finite amount
      of time. The actual value of time is a local matter; this specification
      recommends a value of 100 milliseconds.</t>

      <t>The lower layer may provide facilities for exchanging information
      between the peer and the authenticator about support for ERP, for the
      authenticator to send the domain name information and channel binding
      information to the peer</t>

      <t>Note that to support ERP, lower-layer specifications may need to be
      revised. Specifically, RFC 5996 must be updated to include EAP
      code values higher than 4 in order to use ERP with Internet Key Exchange
      Protocol version 2 (IKEv2). IKEv2 may also be updated to support
      peer-initiated ERP for optimized operation. Other lower layers may need
      similar revisions.</t>

      <t>Our analysis indicates that some EAP implementations are not RFC 3748
      compliant in that instead of silently dropping EAP packets with code
      values higher than 4, they may consider it an error. To accommodate such
      non-compliant EAP implementations, additional guidance has been provided
      below. Furthermore, it may not be easy to upgrade all the peers in some
      cases. In such cases, authenticators may be configured to not send
      EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start; peers may learn whether an authenticator
      supports ERP via configuration or from advertisements at the lower
      layer.</t>

      <t>In order to accommodate implementations that are not compliant to RFC
      3748, such lower layers SHOULD ensure that both parties support ERP;
      this is trivial for instance when using a lower layer that is known
      to always support ERP. For lower layers where ERP support is not
      guaranteed, ERP support may be indicated through signaling (e.g.,
      piggy-backed on a beacon) or through negotiation. Alternatively, clients
      may recognize environments where ERP is available based on
      pre-configuration. Other similar mechanisms may also be used. When ERP
      support cannot be verified, lower layers may mandate falling back to
      full EAP authentication to accommodate EAP implementations that are not
      compliant to RFC 3748.</t>

      <t>AAA Transport of ERP messages is specified by <xref target="RFC5749">Hoeper, et al.</xref>

          <t>Cryptographic algorithm independence <list style="empty">
              <t>The EAP Re-auth Protocol satisfies this requirement. The
              algorithm chosen by the peer for the MAC generation is indicated
              in the EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message. If the chosen algorithm is
              unacceptable, the EAP server returns an EAP-Finish/Re-auth
              message with Failure indication. Algorithm agility for the KDF
              is specified in <xref target="RFC5295">Salowey, et al.</xref>. Only when the
              algorithms used are deemed acceptable does the server proceed with the
              derivation of keys and verification of the proof of possession
              of relevant keying material presented by the peer. A full-blown
              negotiation of algorithms cannot be provided in a single round
              trip protocol. Hence, while the protocol provides algorithm
              agility, it does not provide true negotiation.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Strong, fresh session keys <list style="empty">
              <t>ERP results in the derivation of strong, fresh keys that are
              unique for the given session. An rMSK is always derived
              on-demand when the peer requires a key with a new authenticator.
              The derivation ensures that the compromise of one rMSK does not
              result in the compromise of another rMSK at any time.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Limit key scope <list style="empty">
              <t>The scope of all the keys derived by ERP is well defined. The
              rRK and rIK are never shared with any entity and always remain
              on the peer and the server. The rMSK is provided only to the
              authenticator through which the peer performs the ERP exchange.
              No other authenticator is authorized to use that rMSK.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Replay detection mechanism <list style="empty">
              <t>For replay protection of ERP messages, a sequence number
              associated with the rIK is used. The sequence number is
              maintained by the peer and the server, and initialized to zero
              when the rIK is generated. The peer increments the sequence
              number by one after it sends an ERP message. The server sets the
              expected sequence number to the received sequence number plus
              one after verifying the validity of the received message and
              responds to the message.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Authenticate all parties <list style="empty">
              <t>The EAP Re-auth Protocol provides mutual authentication of
              the peer and the server. Both parties need to possess the keying
              material that resulted from a previous EAP exchange in order to
              successfully derive the required keys. Also, both the EAP
              re-authentication Response and the EAP re-authentication
              Information messages are integrity protected so that the peer
              and the server can verify each other. When the ERP exchange is
              executed with a local ER server, the peer and the local server
              mutually authenticate each other via that exchange in the same
              manner. The peer and the authenticator authenticate each other
              in the secure association protocol executed by the lower layer,
              just as in the case of a regular EAP exchange.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Peer and authenticator authorization <list style="empty">
              <t>The peer and authenticator demonstrate possession of the same
              key material without disclosing it, as part of the lower-layer
              secure association protocol. Channel binding with ERP may be
              used to verify consistency of the identities exchanged, when the
              identities used in the lower layer differ from that exchanged
              within the AAA protocol.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Keying material confidentiality <list style="empty">
              <t>The peer and the server derive the keys independently using
              parameters known to each entity. The AAA server sends the DSRK
              of a domain to the corresponding local ER server via the AAA
              protocol. Likewise, the ER server sends the rMSK to the
              authenticator via the AAA protocol.</t>

              <t>Note that compromise of the DSRK results in compromise of all
              keys derived from it. Moreover, there is no forward secrecy
              within ERP. Thus, compromise of an DSRK retroactively
              compromises all ERP keys.</t>

              <t>It is RECOMMENDED that the AAA protocol be protected using
              IPsec or TLS so that the keys are protected in transit. Note,
              however, that keys may be exposed to AAA proxies along the way
              and compromise of any of those proxies may result in compromise
              of keys being transported through them.</t>

              <t>The home EAP server MUST NOT hand out a given DSRK to a local
              domain server more than once, unless it can verify that the
              entity receiving the DSRK after the first time is the same as
              that received the DSRK originally. If the home EAP server
              verifies authorization of a local domain server, it MAY hand out
              the DSRK to that domain more than once. In this case, the home
              EAP server includes the Authorization Indication TLV to assure
              the peer that DSRK delivery is secure.</t>

              <t>Crypto algorithms for integrity and key derivation in the
              context of ERP MAY be the same as that used by the EAP method.
              In that case, the EAP method is responsible for confirming the
              cryptosuite selection. Furthermore, the cryptosuite is included
              in the ERP exchange by the peer and confirmed by the server. The
              protocol allows the server to reject the cryptosuite selected by
              the peer and provide alternatives. When a suitable rIK is not
              available for the peer, the alternatives may be sent in an
              unprotected fashion. The peer is allowed to retry the exchange
              using one of the allowed cryptosuites. However, in this case,
              any en route modifications to the list sent by the server will
              go undetected. If the server does have an rIK available for the
              peer, the list will be provided in a protected manner and this
              issue does not apply.</t>

          <t>Prevent the domino effect <list style="empty">
              <t>The compromise of one peer does not result in the compromise
              of keying material held by any other peer in the system. Also,
              the rMSK is meant for a single authenticator and is not shared
              with any other authenticator. Hence, the compromise of one
              authenticator does not lead to the compromise of sessions or
              keys held by any other authenticator in the system. Hence, the
              EAP Re-auth Protocol allows prevention of the domino effect by
              appropriately defining key scope.</t>

              <t>However, if keys are transported using hop-by-hop protection,

              runs of ERP messages since the rIKname is not changed as part of
              the ERP protocol. There was no consensus for that requirement at
              the time of development of this specification. If the rIKname is
              not used and the Peer-ID is used instead, the ERP exchange will

              by the authenticator in a AAA request to the server;
              in response, the server may send an EAP-Finish/Re-auth with
              Failure indication in a AAA reply. Note that
              such attacks may be possible with the EAPoL-Start capability of
              IEEE 802.11 and other similar facilities in other link layers
              and where the peer can initiate EAP authentication. An attacker
              may use such messages to start an EAP method run, which fails
              and may result in the server sending a rejection

              <t>To prevent such DoS attacks, an ERP failure should not result
              in deletion of any authorization state established by a full EAP
              exchange. Alternatively, the lower layers and AAA protocols may
              define mechanisms to allow two link-layer security associations
              (SAs) derived from different EAP keying materials for the same
              peer to exist so that smooth migration from the current link
              layer SA to the new one is possible during rekey. These
              mechanisms prevent the link layer connections from being
              terminated when a re-authentication procedure fails due to a
              bogus EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Keying materials Transport<list style="empty">
              <t>When a DSRK is sent from the home EAP server to a local domain
              server or when a rMSK is sent from an ER server to an
              authenticator, in the absence of end-to-end security between the
              entity that is sending the key and the entity receiving the key,
              it is plausible for other entities to get access to keys being
              sent to an ER server in another domain. This mode of key
              transport is similar to that of MSK transport in the context of
              EAP authentication. We further observe that ERP is for access
              authentication and does not support end-to-end data security. In
              typical implementations, the traffic is in the clear beyond the
              access control enforcement point (the authenticator or an entity
              delegated by the authenticator for access control enforcement).
              The model works as long as entities in the middle of the network
              do not use keys intended for other parties to steal service from
              an access network. If that is not achievable, key delivery must
              be protected in an end-to-end manner.</t>

        <t>In writing this document, we benefited from discussing the problem
        space and the protocol itself with a number of folks including Bernard
        Aboba, Jari Arkko, Sam Hartman, Russ Housley, Joe Salowey, Jesse
        Walker, Charles Clancy, Michaela Vanderveen, Kedar Gaonkar, Parag
        Agashe, Dinesh Dharmaraju, Pasi Eronen, Dan Harkins, Yoshi Ohba, Glen
        Zorn, Alan DeKok, Katrin Hoeper, and other participants of the HOKEY
        working group. The credit for the idea to use
        EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start goes to Charles Clancy, and the multiple
        link-layer SAs idea to mitigate the DoS attack goes to Yoshi Ohba.
        Katrin Hoeper suggested the use of the windowing technique to handle
        multiple simultaneous ER exchanges. Many thanks to Pasi Eronen for the
        suggestion to use hexadecimal encoding for rIKname when sent as part
        of keyName-NAI field. Thanks to Bernard Aboba for suggestions in
        clarifying the EAP lock-step operation, and Joe Salowey and Glen Zorn
        for help in specifying AAA transport of ERP messages. Thanks to Sam
        Hartman for the DSRK Authorization Indication mechanism.</t>
