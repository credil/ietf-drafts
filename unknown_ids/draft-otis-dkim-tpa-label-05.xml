    <abstract>
      <t>A third party authorization label (TPA-Label) is a DNS-based extension for DKIM ADSP
        records that allow domains in the From header to authorize acceptable third-party
        signatures. This approach allows autonomous and unilateral authorizations for a range of
        third-party domains using scalable, individual DNS transactions. The extended scope of DKIM
        signing practice assertions supplants more difficult to administer transparent authorization
        schemes. Alternatives for facilitating third-party authorizations currently necessitate
        coordination between two or more domains to synchronously set up selector/key DNS records,
        DNS zone delegations, and/or a regular exchange of public/private keys.</t>

      <t>Checking TPA-Label Resource Records for signing practices may infrequently occur when a
        message is not compliant with restrictive ADSP policies, where an Author Domain Signature is
        either missing or invalid. When a third-party signature is found, TPA-Label Resource Record
        transactions offer an efficient means for Author Domains to authorize specific third-party
        signing domains. Recipients are afforded a method to determine whether authorization exists
        in situations where other modes of authorization are impractical. TPA-Label Resource Records
        permit Author Domains a means to selectively influence message handling, for messages
        otherwise lacking valid Author Domain signatures.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>A transparent method for DKIM authorization represents sharing a number of details between
        the domain owner, and one or more providers of email and DNS. Since there are many ways in
        which such authorizations could be accomplished, it is unlikely standardized formats will be
        developed to exchange necessary, and at times, sensitive information. In addition, when
        there is a security breach and authorization is transparent, the wrong party might be held
        accountable for content they may have never seen nor logged. The TPA-Label Resource Record
        supports a simple authorization method that keeps visible which administrative entity signed
        a message, and whether an Author Domain authorized the signature. The authorization record
        may also impose additional header requirements.</t>

      <t>Tens of thousands of domains of various financial institutions are frequently being
        phished. Phishing creates a nuisance for those who aren't expecting these messages, and a
        threat for those who then interact with them. Whenever institutions employ DKIM and utilize
        various third-party services, the integrity of their Author Domain Signature might be
        affected. Some assert less stringent Author Domain Signing Policies on subdomains to
        accommodate the affect of third-party services, as suggested by <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dkim-mailinglists"/> section 4.1, that recommends use of subdomains to
        assert less restrictive ADSP policies.</t>

      <t>As currently structured, ADSP does not offer an alternative to using more domains, where
        only some are protected by a restrictive policy. It lacks a simple method to retain an
        authentication and authorization acceptance condition while using third party services. This
        limitation forces use of a strategy that increases those being deceived by phishing
        attempts. This is because people often do not understand the significance of URI hierarchy,
        and become confused or insensitive to domain changes. APWG phishing trends, <xref
          target="apwg-globalphishingsurvey-2H2009"/> page 18, indicates phishing commonly uses
        subdomains in a URL to fool potential victims.</t>

      <t>Deterrents that utilize some authorized originating header are ineffective. These headers
        often remain invisible to recipients, and contain domains being exploited for periods
        measured in hours, in an avoidance of a Wack-A-Mole like response. Even long term
        reputations remain problematic due to the intermix of messages from compromised accounts.
        Few recipients inspect the stack of message headers, or are able to draw useful conclusions
        from a profusion of unfriendly information. However, many recipients deal with abuse by
        sorting messages into groups based upon an assumed source found in a few headers.</t>

      <t>Retaining authentication and authorization for the From, Sender, and List-ID headers, and
        ensuring third-party inclusion of a Sender or List-ID header, enhances protections afforded
        from source sorting to reduce susceptibility to being deceived by look-alike phishing
        attempts. However, when subdomains assert less stringent policies that omit authentication,
        these messages might be combined with those having more stringent policies when sorting is
        based upon parent domains. Consistently using the same domain avoids confusion that might
        otherwise be exploited to deceive recipients.</t>

      <t>ADSP represents an open registry which offers domain specific guidance for DKIM acceptance
        criteria, when determining whether messages should be delivered, refused or discarded.
        However, appropriate actions become unclear whenever third-party services are involved. For
        example, it is not clear whether ADSP "dkim=all" assertions include third-party services
        that could potentially damage Author-Domain signatures. Although ADSP warns of a potential
        for disruption, specific handling recommendations are limited to "dkim=discardable".
        Administrative domains that assert all of their outbound messages are signed offer
        significant forensic value. However, the handling for their messages lacking an Author
        Domain Signature with an ADSP "dkim=all" assertion remains unclear.</t>

      <t>This document describes how any Author Domain publishing ADSP records defined in <xref
          target="RFC5617"/>, can autonomously authorize DKIM signatures <xref target="RFC4871"/>
        (updated by <xref target="RFC5672"/>) by specific domains. TPA-Label listed domains offer
        secondary signing practices for additional ADSP compliance options, whenever no Author
        Domain Signature is present within the message. The intended purpose of TPA-Label Resource
        Records is to improve acceptance rates of genuine messages, to minimize domain use, to
        minimize success rates for phishing, and to minimize a recipient's administrative costs.</t>

      <t>TPA-Label Resource Records authorize third-party signing domains and services to extend
        DKIM compliance options for signing practices defined by <xref target="RFC5617"/>. TPA-Label
        listed domains, TPA-LLD, are to be considered equivalent to the authorizing Author Domain
        when assessing compliance with ADSP. The TXT resource records, associated with TPA-Label,
        start with the 'dkim' tag as defined by <xref target="RFC5617"/> for signing practices, and
        may contain tags specifically defined for TPA-Label Resource Records.</t>

            When the "tpa" tag does not exist, the referenced domain is presumed listed. The "scope"
            tag may stipulate the existence of additional headers or which email elements are to
            confirm an administrative domain of a service before being authorized to act on behalf
            of the Author Domain. Following <xref target="RFC5321"/>, domain name comparisons, as

            field, is the domain name referenced in the TPA-Label Resource Record published by the
            Author Domain with a scope of 'F', 'S', or 'L'. For 'S' and 'L' scopes, the respective
            Sender header or a List-ID identifier of the List-ID header must exist for either scope

            the presence of the 'H' and 'M' scopes respectively. For additional 'S' or 'L' scopes,
            the respective Sender header or a List-ID identifier of the List-ID header must exist
            for either scope and contain a domain within the TPA-LLD for authorization to be

    <section title="Combinatorial ADSP &quot;dkim=&quot; Values.">
      <t>This document defines two new values listed with the ADSP "dkim" tag in addition to those
        defined in <xref target="RFC5617"/> section 4.2.1. These values can append to those
        currently defined, or used separately. When used separately, the value "all" is to be
        assumed to prefix the new values when recognized, otherwise the value "unknown" will be
        assumed. It is not recommended to use any new value in conjunction with "discardable",
        because when not understood, a message that depends upon different handling might become
        lost.</t>

      <section title="tpa-sig">
        <t>The ADSP dkim= value "tpa-sig" indicates that TPA-Labels will offer a comprehensive list
          of Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party Signatures that may include header requirements.
          When there is no valid Author Domain Signature or Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party
          Signature, the Author Domain recommends these messages be refused.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="tpa-path">
        <t>The ADSP dkim= value "tpa-path" indicates that TPA-Labels will offer a comprehensive list
          of Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party Signatures and Authorized Third-Party Services
          that may include header requirements.</t>

        <t>The "tpa-path" is used to accommodate third party services lacking DKIM signatures, the
          confirmed path of the message determined by either the client host name (EHLO/HELO) or the
          return path (Mail From). The permitted path element's domain is authorized by a TPA-Label
          Resource Record with the scope of 'H' or 'M' respectively. Such messages are then in
          compliance with the Author Domain's asserted Signing Policies. The leaf of the host name
          (left most label) may need to be omitted when checking for TPA-Label Resource Record
          authorization.</t>

        <t>When there is no valid Author Domain Signature, or Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party
          Signature, or Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party Service, the Author Domain recommends
          these messages be refused.</t>

        <t>ADSP defends domains against spoofing. Any subdomain of a domain publishing an ADSP with
          the "dkim" tag value containing "tpa-sig" or "tpa-path" not also publishing an MX resource
          record, should be assumed to have published the same ADSP records there as well.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="TPA-Label Resource Record Authorization Considerations">
      <t>When an Author Domain is not within the DKIM signing domain, the TPA-LLD scheme can extend
        ADSP signing practice compliance. The TPA-LLD scheme with an 'F', 'S', or 'L' scope permits
        a contained Third Party Signature to be treated as an Author Domain Signature. The 'H' and
        'M' scopes permit acceptance based upon confirmation of either the client host name
        (EHLO/HELO) or the return path (Mail From) respectively. For 'S' and 'L' scopes, the
        respective Sender header or a List-ID identifier of the List-ID header must exist for either
        scope and contain a domain within the TPA-LLD for authorization to be valid. This allows
        Author Domains a means to extend restrictive policy compliance. The TPA-LLD scheme for
        offering valid authorization only requires DNS publications be made by the Author Domain,
        even when signing domains and the Author Domain differ. This approach avoids a need to
        exchange DKIM key related information.</t>

      <t>Extended authorization will not ensure all possible spoofing is prevented. However, by
        permitting broader use of restrictive policies, this should generally reduce the level of
        spoofing over what might be otherwise allowed. Authorized third party messages should not
        receive annotations that indicate the message contains authenticated identities. The TPA-LLD
        scope should include the 'S' or 'L' scope where appropriate to allow recipients a means to
        isolate different message sources.</t>

      <t>The TPA-LLD scheme plays the role of only providing acceptable signatures or services which
        might be suitable for non-critical messages, with the goal of improving delivery acceptance,
        such as those from specific mailing-lists. Before TPA-LLD authorization is deployed, the
        Author Domain should be assured by domains being authorized that appropriate measures are in
        place to authenticate those who are submitting messages.</t>

      <t>The "dkim=" tag within the TPA-Label Resource Record is expected to normally contain a copy
        of the value asserted by the ADSP Resource Record "dkim" tag. When the TPA-Label Resource
        Record "dkim" tag value differs, and the message is compliant with the "scope" and "ad" tag
        values, the TPA-Label Resource Record "dkim" tag value overrides the ADSP Resource Record
        "dkim" tag value. Use of "tpa-path" should selectively override the ADSP "tpa-sig" only
        where needed.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="eval-3p-signing-domain"
      title="Evaluating the Third-party Signing Domain or Service">
      <t>An Author Domain deploying a TPA-Label Resource Record does so on a trust basis. Reasons
        for deploying TPA-Label Resource Records might be to allow deployment of more stringent ADSP
        records while also utilizing third-party signatures or services.</t>

      <t>When an authorized Third Party Signer does not employ DKIM authentication with ADSP or does
        not include Authentication-Results headers, this could allow authorizations to be
        exploited.</t>

      <section anchor="tpa-auth" title="Third Party Authentication">
        <t>The Author Domain SHOULD ensure the Authorization Scope of the TPA-Label Resource Record
          is authenticated. There are a number of ways email can be authenticated, and different
          authentication mechanisms validate different parts of the email. The following are
          examples of how authorization might work.</t>

        <section title="Third Party Authentication - Web Email Provider with Subscriber Pingbacks">
          <t>The Author Domain "example.com" wants to deploy a TPA-Label Resource Record to permit
            their traveling agents the use of "webmail.example.net" services. This email provider
            has a closed user policy and adds DKIM signatures to messages on behalf of the
            "webmail.example.net" domain.</t>

          <t>The closed user policy of "webmail.example.net" permits subscribers to post messages
            with Author Domains that are not "webmail.example.net" in the From header fields, only
            when control of the Author Address has been validated by a response to an encoded
            "pingback" email. The "webmail.example.net" service also establishes accounts to
            authenticate all users sending messages through their service. Therefore, the referenced
            TPA-Label Resource Record can include an 'F' scope value to authorize Author Domain
            messages signed by this Third-Party Signer.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Third Party Authentication - Closed Mailing List Example">
          <t>The Author Domain wants to deploy a TPA-Label Resource Record for a mailing list with a
            closed posting policy that redistributes email in a way which breaks Author Domain
            Signatures, but adds a DKIM signature on behalf of the mailing list domain and includes
            an Authentication-Results header field for posted messages. The closed posting policy is
            enforced by requiring subscribers to validate their control of their Author Address by
            responding to encoded "pingback" email sent to this address.</t>

          <t>Since the mailing list management always verifies control of the Author Address, and is
            configured to include Authentication-Results headers, and includes a List-ID header, the
            referenced TPA-Label Resource Record can include an 'L' scope value to permit Author
            Domain messages containing an authorized List-ID domain to be signed by this Third-Party
            Signer.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Third Party Authentication - Open Mailing List Example">
          <t>The Author Domain wants to deploy a TPA-Label Resource Record for a mailing list with
            an open posting policy that redistributes email in a way that breaks Author Domain
            Signatures, but that adds a DKIM signature on behalf of the mailing list domain and
            includes an Authentication-Results header field for posted messages. The open posting
            policy will refuse messages lacking Author Domain Signatures for domains that have
            deployed an ADSP signing practice of "dkim=all" or "dkim=discardable".</t>

          <t>Since the list management always refuses to post an Author Address lacking a Author
            Domain Signature when the domain has deployed an ADSP record with an "dkim=all" or
            "dkim=discardable", and is configured to include Authentication-Results headers, and

            "temp.example.org" to handle overflow secretarial support. The agency "temp.example.org"
            sends email on behalf of the executive staff of "example.com" and adds the Sender header
            field of "secretary@temp.example.org" in the email. Since "temp.example.org" only allows
            its own staff to email through its server which adds "temp.example.org" DKIM signatures,
            a TPA-LLD can include the "temp.example.org" domain with an 'S' scope to specifically
            authorize messages containing the Sender header field to help ensure these messages are
            not handled as phishing attempts.</t>

          <section title="Abuse and DSN Reporting">
            <t>There is likely little interest for an otherwise uninvolved domain to receive a
              massive number of bogus messages being returned as feedback. Often the purpose of
              feedback is to discover compromised systems or accounts actively being exploited in
              some manner. Unless there is evidence that the Author Domain either handled or
              authorized the handling of the message, only statistics and samples should be reported
              to the associated Autonomous System, and perhaps to the Author Domain when an interest
              is expressed.</t>

            <t>The 'H' and 'M' scopes available within the TPA-LLD records allow the Author Domain
              to be associated with SMTP Clients publicly transmitting messages, and/or the Mail
              return path when these domains differ, and when DKIM is not employed by the
              third-party service. In this case, appropriate DSN or abuse reporting to the Author
              Domain is better assured as a result. The correspondence between SMTP Client hosts and
              Mail return path can be affirmed by the TPA-LLD scheme with a scope of 'H' or 'M' that
              might be used to categorize feedback data or confirm DSN destinations.</t>

            <t>Services that depend only upon path authorizations, will permit other domains to
              spoof the Author Domain, and yet obtain acceptance. During such events, the Author
              Domain might need to retract their authorization from the service. For this reason,
              "tpa-path" authorization should only be used as a carefully monitored interim
              solution.</t>

              The Author Domain can authorize the domain "invite.example.net" or "example.net" with

              should also limit the number of DNS transactions that might be attempted, or this

                <t>Current experimental path protocols combine into a single set of all IPv4 and
                  IPv6 addresses for all outbound servers handling a domain's messages. To aggregate
                  this potentially large set of resources, path protocols provide up to one hundred
                  and eleven separate DNS transactions. One to obtain the initial record, one for
                  each of the ten permitted mechanisms, which may in turn require up to ten
                  transactions to resolve the mechanism's target list.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

                <t>Path protocol libraries expand macros containing email address local-parts as
                  locations for subsequent resource records. This allows a cached path related
                  resource record to produce a new set of DNS transactions whenever the local-part

      <t>The receiver obtains domain authorizations with a DNS query for an IN class TXT TPA-Label
        resource record located below the location specified in <xref target="RFC4871"/> section 7.4
        and the label "_tpa.". The TPA-Label itself is generated by processing the domain in
        question, which normally matches the DKIM signature's "d=" parameter. A TPA-Label Resource
        Record is published adjacent to the <xref target="RFC5617"/> conventional ADSP record, for
        example below "_tpa._domainkey.&lt;Author-Domain&gt;". The Author Domain provides
        authorization for other domains with the existence of a TPA-Label TXT resource record. When
        a "tpa" tag value exists, it must include the referenced domain for authorization to be
        valid. Authorization to act on behalf of the Author Domain can also be limited by the
        "scope" tag value for specific message elements.</t>

      <t>An Author Domain may wish to delegate the listing of third-party services to a different
        administrative domain. Ideally, this would be accomplished by delegating the
        _tpa._domainkey.&lt;Author-Domain&gt; zone to the administrative entity handling publication

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This draft extends signing practices for <xref target="RFC4871"/> where most generic DKIM
        Signature related security matters are discussed. Additional considerations are also
        included in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dkim-mailinglists"/>. Security considerations for the
        TPA-LLD scheme are mostly related to attempts on the part of malicious senders to falsely
        represent themselves as other senders, often in an attempt to defraud either the recipient
        or the alleged originator.</t>

      <t>Additional security considerations regarding DKIM signing practices may be found in the
        DKIM threat analysis <xref target="RFC4686"/>.</t>

      <section title="Benefits to Recipients">
        <t>The verifier, after finding either an Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party Signature or
          Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party Service in a message, will have significantly
          greater confidence in the Third-Party, than when no TPA-Label Resource Record is obtained.
          This enhanced confidence may, at the recipients' discretion, cause a message to be
          delivered to the recipient without further source related assessment.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Risks to Recipients">
        <t>The decisions a recipient makes in regard to message filtering based on TPA-Label
          Resource Records are likely to depend on the system integrity of the Third Party with
          respect to the Authentication (see <xref target="tpa-auth"/>) and the provided scope
          labels. When the 'H' or 'M' scoped element is not authenticated by the Third Party or a
          domain is not confirmed, there is a risk of accepting potentially spoofed messages. When
          there is no out-of-band authentication confirming the sender, Authentication-Results
          headers then play an important role. Without proper Authentication-Results handling by the
          third-party, there is also risk of accepting potentially spoofed messages.</t>

        <t>With this specification, third party signatures have verifiable value. When implementing
          the compliance assessment of third party signatures and TPA-Label Resource Records,
          implementers need to consider the possibility that a Bad Actor will send the recipient a
          message with a large number of valid DKIM Signatures. Verifying all of these may consume a
          large amount of processing resources such that it may be worth checking the existence of a
          TPA-Label Resource Record first. <xref target="tpa-qt"/> describes a quick check to see if
          TPA-Label Resource Records may exist. Additionally validating DKIM signatures and
          obtaining related resource records might be limited to known trustworthy domains.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Benefits to Author Domains">
        <t>TPA-Label resource records can replace domain delegations, selector/key record mirroring,
          or key exchanges. A significant number of details are associated with selector/key
          records. These details include user limitations, suitable services, key resource record's
          Time-To-Live, revocation and update procedures, and how the DKIM Signature header field's
          'i=' semantics are to be applied. In addition, services that depend upon DKIM keys are
          better secured by not delegating these DKIM keys, where instead the TPA-LLD scheme allows
          Author Domains an ability to limit the scope of their authorizations, while also not being
          mistaken for having authenticated the entity submitting the message.</t>

        <t>TPA-Label Resource Records convey which domains are authoritative even when they are not
          the Author Domain. However, authorized domains are unable to utilize the DKIM signature's
          'i=' semantics to directly assert which identifiers on whose behalf a signature was added.
          As such, no domain should be authorized unless it is trusted to ensure the Alleged Author
          of an email undergoes authentication that offers acceptable protections for the Author
          Domain. For example, such authentication might ensure submitting entities have
          demonstrated receipt of "pingback" messages sent to the Author Address contained within
          the messages being signed.</t>

        <t>By deploying TPA-Label Resource Records, Author Domains benefit when recipients assess
          signing practice compliance by using the TPA-LLD scheme. These recipients will be less
          likely to drop the Author Domain's genuine messages, whenever the Author Domain attempts
          to restrict acceptance. Restricting acceptance of non-compliant messages is the basic
          motivation for publishing ADSP records. In addition, recipients are more likely to
          validate Authorized Third Party Domain Signatures.</t>

        <t>Broader use of restrictive ADSP policies provides a better likelihood of being able to
          eliminate a greater range of non-compliant messages, in addition to improving acceptance
          from authorized sources. With authorization, scope labels allow the Author Domain to
          control message attributes even from the authorized third parties.</t>

        <t>Signing domains having good reputations referenced by a TPA-LLD might therefore provide a
          means to safely extend limited compliance assessment resources to otherwise unknown
          domains or SMTP Clients.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Risks to Author Domains">
        <t>As indicated in <xref target="eval-3p-signing-domain"/>, there is ultimately a trust of
          the third party domain to do the right thing and not generate, or allow others to
          generate, messages that falsely appear to be from the Author Domain. The authentication
          methods in place for different email elements need to be carefully reflected in the scope
          of the TPA records.</t>

        <t>By authorizing mailing lists with TPA-Label Resource Records, this could cause a loss of
          confidentiality in mailing list participation by the Author Domain. This might help Bad
          Actors deduce which subscription related email the Author Domain may receive. Because of
          the hashing function in generating the TPA-label, anyone wishing to discover which domains
          are being authorized, has to probe each TPA-label based on the exact signing domain. In
          addition, service organizations or community groups are able to share comprehensive lists
          which means, even though the domain has been authorized, that in itself does not mean the
          Author Domain is exchanging messages with the authorized domain.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Benefits to Third Party Signers">
        <t>Third Party Signers benefit by allowing those using their service, the autonomy to
          authorize their service without needing to exchange DKIM key related details. This is
          particularly useful for mailing lists.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Risks caused by Third Party Signers">
        <t>As mentioned before, Third Party Signers need to authenticate messages from Author
          Domains. This authentication provides a safety mechanism for the Author Domain and their
          recipients. The Third Party may not be aware of the authentication value or the message
          elements involved and make changes without understanding the impact this may have upon
          targeted Author Domains and their recipients. For example, the Third Party might stop DKIM
          signing or stop applying Authentication-Results headers. The unexpected exposure might
          enable wide spread abuse and prove detrimental for both the Author Domain and their
          recipients.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="SHA-1 Collisions">
        <t>The use of the SHA-1 hash algorithm does not represent a security concern. The hash
          simply ensures a deterministic domain-name size is achieved. Unexpected collisions can be
          detected and handled by using the extended TPA-Label Resource Record "tpa=" option. The
          use of TPA-Label Resource Records without the TPA-Label "tpa=" options does present an
          opportunity for an adversary to attempt to find a hash collision. Message spoofing outside
          the realm of DKIM protection is likely easier to achieve than finding hash collisions.
          There is minimal risk of TPA-Labels colliding. Listing 3 x 10^45 domains has less than a
          0.1 percent risk of any two domain labels colliding.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="DNS" title="DNS Limits">
        <t>Use of the TPA-Label Resource Records, rather than simply listing the authorized domain,
          ensures the DNS record size is independent of the Third Party Domain. The typical domain
          name size has been steadily increasing. This increase has been caused by domain names that
          encode international character sets. Perhaps soon there will be a futher increase spurred
          by an expanse of TLDs having larger international labels.</t>

        <t>The maximum domain name size allowed, per <xref target="RFC1034"/> Section 3, is 255
          bytes (or octets). Each label has a byte for its length. Every domain name has a right
          most label representing the root with a zero length, for another byte. A scheme that
          concatenates a listed domain with the publishing domain, separated by some conventional
          label, reduces the maximal domain name in half, where the conventional label reduces this
          further.</t>

        <t>If "_tpa." were used as the conventional label with a simple listing method, the maximum
          domain name size this supports would be 122 bytes. The suffix for TPA-Labels is
          "_tpa.domainkey." which consumes 16 bytes. The TPA-Label itself consumes 34 bytes. A
          domain that publishes the TPA labels in their domain, would then have 205 bytes available
          for their Author Domain. Since an Author's Domain Acceptable Third-Party Service might not
          implement DKIM, the TPA-Label is still able to authorize any domain name with a valid
          length. As a result, the maximum allowable Author Domain is increased by 83 bytes or
          68&percnt; over simple name concatenation.</t>

        <t>Normally, DNS messages should not exceed 512 bytes as per Section 2.3.4 of <xref
            target="RFC1035"/>. Using TPA-Label Resource Records in the DNS, as described by this
          document, consumes a consistent 50 bytes, in addition to the domain name publishing the
          TPA-Labels. With this being constant, a limit can be determined as a constraint to
          resource record size, to ensure a response does not exceed the maximum DNS message size.
          DNS servers that add additional resource records, for nameservers as an example, will
          further reduce available resource record capacity. Domains publishing TPA-Labels exceeding
          the DNS message limit will need to rely on recipients using TCP for DNS retrieval, or
          EDNS0 <xref target="RFC2671"/> for extended DNS lengths. <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
