Internet-Draft          RSerPool Bakeoff Scoring               July 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document will be used as a basis for point scoring at upcoming
   RSerPool bakeoffs.  Its purpose is similar to that described in
   RFC1025.  It is hoped that a clear definition of where and how to
   score points will further the development of RSerPool.

   Note that while attending a bakeoff no one else will score your
   points for you.  We trust that all implementations will faithfully
   record their points that are received honestly.  Note also that these
   scores are NOT to be used for marketing purposes.  They are for the
   use of the implementations to know how well they are doing.  The only
   reporting that will be done is a basic summary to the Reliable Server
   Pooling Working Group but please note that NO company or
   implementation names will be attached.


2.  Aggregate Server Access Protocol

   The ASAP protocol is described in the follwing documents:

   o  [RFC5352]

   o  [RFC5354]

   o  [I-D.dreibholz-rserpool-asap-hropt]

   o  [I-D.dreibholz-rserpool-delay]

2.1.  Pool Element Communication

   These points will be scored for EACH peer implementation that you
   successfully communicate with.

   o  2 Successful ASAP Registration Request of a PE in a pool using
      Round Robin policy and handling of ASAP Registration Response.

   o  2 Failing ASAP Registration Request of a PE requesting Least Used
      policy in a pool using Round Robin policy and appropriate handling
      of ASAP Registration Response (e.g. printing error message, but
      not retrying registration).

   o  2 Successful re-registration of a PE in a pool using Round Robin
      policy.

   o  2 Successful ASAP Deregistration Request of the PE from its pool
      and handling of ASAP Deregistration Response.

      CYCLE.

   o  5 Requesting peer list from new ENRP server using ENRP Peer List
      Request, handling ENRP Peer List Response and adding entries to
      its own peer list.

   o  5 Successful detection of different handlespace checksums upon
      reception of ENRP Presence (due to out-of-date PE), request of
      Handle Table with W-bit set, removal of PE from local handlespace
      copy and reporting the correct checksum in own ENRP Presence.

   plus a set of peers running another implementation.

   o  5 Successfully detecting the failure of a remote peer and
      initiating a takeover procedure.

   o  5 Acknowledging another peer's takeover and aborting own takeover

      change and informing the PEs taken over.


4.  Bonus Points

   You can also earn Bonus Points:

   o  20 points for the ENRP server handling the largest number of PEs.

   o  20 points for the ENRP server achieving the highest handle
      resolution throughput for a pool containing 100 (should this be
      larger?)  PEs.

   Please note that the whole period of the bakeoff is relevant.

   [RSerPoolPage].  It supports the functionalities defined by
   [RFC5351], [RFC5352], [RFC5353], [RFC5354] and [RFC5356] as well as
   the options [I-D.dreibholz-rserpool-asap-hropt],
   [I-D.dreibholz-rserpool-enrp-takeover] and
   [I-D.dreibholz-rserpool-delay].  An introduction to this
   implementation is provided in [Dre2006].


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does only describe test scenarios and therefore does
   not introduce any new security issues.

   For security considerations of the RSerPool protocols see [RFC3237],
   [RFC5351], [RFC5352], [RFC5353], [RFC5354].  [RFC5356] and in
   particular [RFC5355].


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no additional considerations for IANA.
