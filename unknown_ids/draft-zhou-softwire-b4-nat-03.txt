    Abstract 

       The dual-stack lite mechanism provide an IPv4 access method over IPv6   
       ISP network for end users.  Dual-Stack Lite enables an IPv6 provider 
       to share IPv4 addresses among customers by combining IPv4-in-IPv6 
       tunnel and Carrier Grade NAT technologies.  However, with basic Dual-
       stack Lite approach, CGN has to maintain active NAT sessions, which 
       requires processing performance, memory size for NAT sessions and log 
       abilities scale with number of sessions from subscribers, and hence 
       result in increasing of CAPEX for operators when traffic increase. 

       This document propose the lightweight extensions to DS-Lite, which 
       allows offloading NAT translation function from centralized network 
       side (AFTR) to distributed customer equipments (B4), thereby offering 
       flexibilities for ISPs to adjust trade-off between CAPEX (e.g. less 
       performance requirements on AFTR device), OPEX (e.g., easy and fast 
       deployment of Dual-Stack Lite). The ability of easily co-deploying 
       with basic Dual-Stack Lite is essential to lightweight extension to 
       DS-Lite.

    1. Introduction 

       Dual-stack lite technology [RFC6333] provides IPv4 access over IPv6 
       access network. Dual-Stack lite (DS-lite) also mitigates IPv4 address 
       exhaustion by sharing public IPv4 addresses amongst users.The B4 
       element establishes an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire to the AFTR and 
       encapsulates the IPv4 packets into the softwire.  When AFTR receives 
       the IPv6 packets, it will decapsulate them and perform NAT-44 on the 
       packets. 

       The AFTR is required to maintain active NAT sessions.  In a 
       centralized deployment models where one AFTR serves thousands of 
       users, the large numbers of NAT sessions may become performance 
       bottom-neck.  First, maintaining active NAT sessions requires AFTR 
       constantly creating and purging NAT sessions.  Second, a large NAT 
       table demands more processing power   for searching and more memory 
       space.  In addition, dynamic session-based NAT will create large 
       number of log entries, which will also be a challenging problem. 

       To address these issues, we propose an extension to DS-lite.  The B4 
       element will be   provisioned with an IPv6 address, an IPv4 address 
       and restricted port sets, so that address and port translation can be 
       performed at the customer side, e.g.,CPE, with only one requirement 
       that port translation should inside the restricted port sets. 

       The IPv4 traffic over IPv6 transport would reuse the basic DS-Lite 
       infrastructure, including tunneling transport and provisioning method 
       as well, and share basic idea of using mapping table on a per IPv6 
       address basis to initiate customers. The AFTR will then only maintain 
       a static mapping entry between the IPv6 address, IPv4 address and 
       port set ID, instead of maintain NAT entries per session. For inbound 
       IPv4 packet on AFTR, it would use the IPv4 destination address and 
       port as the index and use the forwarding rule in the mapping table to 
       encapsulate the packets to the destination CPE.  

        

       Compared to DS-lite, this lightweight extension makes the AFTR table 
       scales with customer number other than traffic sessions. Based on 
       this lightweight extension, log entries for per subscriber instead of 
       per session is also achiveble.IPv4 address utilization efficiency 
       depends on port allocation strategies ,e.g., per port on demand, or a 
       buck of ports pre-allocation, which would be elaborated in Section 5.

       Compared to stateless solutions with port set allocation such as 4rd, 
       this mechanism is suitable for operators who prefer to keep IPv6 and 
       IPv4 addressing separated.  For example, an operator may want to 
       provide IPv4 with an on-demand way in its IPv6 network, the dynamic 
       allocation of IPv4 address and port makes more efficient usage of 
       IPv4 resource.  Another example is that an operator may only have 
       many small and discontinuous IPv4 blocks available to provide IPv4 
       over IPv6, rather than a few big IPv4 blocks.  This mechanism keeps 
       dynamic feature of IPv4-IPv6 address binding as in DS-Lite, so it 
       won't require administrating and managing many 4rd domains in the 
       network and mapping rules in the CPEs.

    Internet-Draft    Lightweight extension to DS-Lite        October 2011 
        

       NATed B4:  A Lightweight extended B4 which is called NATed B4 in this 
       document can be either an IPv6 hosts or a CPE. NATed B4 performs IP 
       address and port translation function, besides establishment of IPv4 
       in IPv6 tunnel with AFTR. 

        

       Lightweight AFTR: A Lightweight extended AFTR which is called 
       Lightweight AFTR is responsible for establishing IPv4 in IPv6 
       tunneling with NATed B4 to transport IPv4 over IPv6 while the NAT 
       translation function is offloaded to NATed B4. 

        

       A NATed B4 uses IPv4 address with a restricted port set for this IPv4 
       connectivity, which may be provisioned via either DHCPv4 with the 
       AFTR, or via PCP with the PCP server. The AFTR keeps the mapping 
       between B4's IPv6 address, allocated IPv4 address, and a restricted 
       port set ID on a per customer basis. 

       For host NATed B4 case, the host gets public address directly. It is 
       also suggested that the host run a local NAT to map randomly 
       generated ports into the restricted port set. Private to public 
       address translation would not be needed in this NAT.  Another   
       solution is to have the IP stack to only assign ports within the   
       restricted port set to applications.  Either way the host guarantees 
       that every port number in the packets sent out by itself   falls into 
       the allocated port set. 

        

        

        

    3. NATed B4 Behavior  

       The NATed B4 is responsible for performing NAT and/ALG functions, 
       basic B4 functions, as well as supporting NAT Traversal mechanisms 
       (e.g., UPnP or NAT-PMP). 

       The tunneling provisioning of the B4 element should reuse what has 
       defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

    3.1. Plain IPv4 Address 

       A NATed B4 MAY be assigned with a plain IPv4 address. 

       When a plain, IPv4 address is assigned, the NAT operations are 
       enforced as per current legacy CPEs.  The NAT in the AFTR is disabled   
       for that user.IPv4 datagrams are encapsulated in IPv6 as specified in 
       [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite]. 

        

    3.2. Restricted IPv4 Address and port set provisioning 

    3.2.1. Restricted port allocation strategies and requirements 

       Restricted port allocation strategies for this approach could either 
       be allocating per port on demand, or be pre-allocating a port set (no 
       matter a continuous port range, or multiple non-continuous sub port 
       sets),which leads to trade-off between provisioning  efficiency and 
       IPv4 utilization efficiency.  

        

       Note that efficiency on log is reported by operators as a practical 
       requirement for AFTR, hence port set decoding should take this 
       requirement into account, no matter which port allocation strategy is 
       adopt. 

        

       Unlike stateless 4over6 solutions such as  [I-D.murakami-softwire-
       4rd], the restricted port sets allocation for Lightweight extended 
       DS-Lite has no requires on careful planning of the IPv6 domain range, 
       IPv4/IPv6 mapping relationship, prefix length and multiplex ratio, 
       etc. It therefore offers more flexibility for ISPs, when it comes   
       to managing the IPv6 access network, and introduces no impact on IPv6 
       routing. 

        

    3.2.2. Restricted IPv4 Address and port set provisioning method 

       One is extending DHCP to support address allocation with port range   
       embedded.  [I-D.bajko-pripaddrassign] discusses this DHCP usage. In   
       this special context, we need to build the DHCPv4 procedure over IPv6   
       [I-D.cui-softwire-dhcp-over-tunnel].  

     
     
    DBW                    Expires April 25, 2012                 [Page 6] 
        
    Internet-Draft    Lightweight extension to DS-Lite        October 2011 
        

       The basic PCP protocol allows per port on demand allocation, while an 
       extension to PCP  [I-D.tsou-pcp-natcoord] supports pre-allocate bulk 
       of ports. 

         

       Adopting either method, An NATed B4 can have a restricted port set 
       with an IPv4 addresses allocated from the lightweight AFTR. 

        

    3.3. Outgoing Packets Processing 

       Upon receiving an IPv4 packet, the B4 performs NAT using the public 
       IPv4 address and port set assigned to it.  Then B4 encapsulates the   
       resulting IPv4 packet into an IPv6 packet, and delivers it through 
       IPv6 connectivity to AFTR which will then decapsulate the 
       encapsulated packet and forward it through IPv4.  The destination   
       IPv6 address used for encapsulation should be the AFTR's address. 

        

    3.4. Incoming Packets Processing 

       Upon receipt of IPv4-in-IPv6 packet from AFTR, B4 will decapsulate 
       the packet and translate the public IPv4 address to the private IPv4 
       address.  Finally, it delivers the packet to the host using the   
       translated IPv4 address.  The source IPv6 address used for 
       encapsulation at AFTR is the AFTR's address, and the destination 
       address is set to the external address of B4. 

    3.4.1. Incoming Ports considerations on a given restricted IPv4 address 

       As described in [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues], a bulk 
       of incoming ports can be reserved as a centralized resource shared by 
       all subscribers using a given restricted IPv4 address.  In order to 
       distribute incoming ports as fair as possible among subscribers 
       sharing a given restricted IPv4 address, other than allocating a 
       continuous range of ports to each, a solution to distribute bulks of 
       non-continuous ports among subscribers, which also takes port 
       randomization into account, is elaborated in Section 3.1. 

        

    4. Lightweight AFTR Behaviour 

        
     
     
    DBW                    Expires April 25, 2012                 [Page 7] 
        
    Internet-Draft    Lightweight extension to DS-Lite        October 2011 
        

       The lightweight AFTR should either allocate port restricted addresses 
       directly (perform an extended DHCPv4 server, or a basic or/extended 
       PCP server), or leave the allocation to dedicated DHCP/PCP server 
       (and perform a relay in DHCP case). 

       When accomplishing one such allocation, the lightweight AFTR 
       simultaneously install a mapping entry into the mapping table.  This 
       entry consists of the public IPv4 address the port set ID and NATed's 
       IPv6 address. Its lifetime is set as per restricted IPv4 provisioning 
       method. It'll be used for encapsulation of inbound packets.  This 
       mapping entry would be deleted when the lifetime expires, and refresh 
       its lifetime when the NATed B4 renews/extends the allocation. 

        

       The data plane function of the lightweight AFTR is purely 
       encapsulation and decapsulation.  When receiving an IPv4-in-IPv6 
       packet from an NATed B4, the lightweight AFTR decapsulates it and 
       forwards it to IPv4 Internet.  When receiving an IPv4 packet from the 
       Internet, it uses the destination address and port from this packet 
       to lookup the destination NATed B4's IPv6 address in the mapping 
       table.  Then the lightweight AFTR encapsulates this packet using the 
       IPv6 address found in the table as IPv6 destination address, and 
       forwards it to the correct NATed B4  based on native IPv6 routing.   

        

       Since basic DS-Lite transporting infrastructure is re-used, no 
       influence introduced from IPv4 routing to the IPv6 routing. 

        

    5. Fragmentation and Reassembly and DNS 

       No change to Section 5.3 of [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite. The 
       DNS behavior is the same as described in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-
       stack-lite]. 

        

    6. ICMP processing 

       ICMP availability would become a challenge in port restricted address   
       environment.  To support ICMP "session" initiated from a NATed B4, 
       the mechanism divides ICMP id field in the same way with dividing

       allocated address and restricted id range when send out an ICMP 
       request.  Hence the lightweight AFTR can encapsulate the 
       corresponding ICMP reply correctly according to the ICMP id field. 

       The inbound ICMP request would be left unsupported on the NATed AFTR, 
       which is the similar behavior of NAT/CGN.  See details about ICMP 
       processing in section 4.2 of [I-D.sun-v6ops-laft6] 

        

        

    7.  Security Considerations 

        

       As port randomization is one protection among others against blind 
       attacks, a simple non-contiguous port sets distribution mechanism is   
       therefore proposed to distribute bulks of non-continuous ports among   
       subscribers, and to enable subscribers operating port randomized NAT. 

       In this section, a non-continuous restricted port set 
       encoding/decoding and an algorithm of random ephemeral port selection 
       within the allocated restricted port set example proves that port 
       randomization is applicable this approach. 

       On every external IPv4 address, according to port set size N, log2(N)   
       bits are randomly choosing by lightweight AFTR as subscribers 
       identification bits(s bit) among 1st and 16th bits. Take a sharing 
       ration 1:32 for example, Figure 1 shows an example of 5 random 
       selected bits of s bits.

       Subscriber ID pattern is formed by setting all the s bits to 1 and 
       other trivial bits to 0.  Figure 2 illustrates an example of 
       subscriber ID pattern on a sharing ration 1:32 address.  Note that 
       the subscriber ID pattern will be different, guaranteed by the random   
       s bit selection, on every restricted IP address no matter whether the   
       sharing ratio varies.The lightweight AFTR can use subscriber ID 
       pattern as port set ID on a per restricted IPv4 address basis, which 
       allows log entries scale on a subscriber basis, hence meets the log 
       efficiency requirements described in Section 3.1.2.

       Subscribers ID value is then assigned by setting subscriber ID 
       pattern bits (s bits shown in the following example) according to a 
       customer value and setting other trivial bits to 1.
