Internet-Draft   IPv4 Support for DSMIPv6 IPv6 Home Link  September 2009


Abstract

   Mobile IPv6 for Dual Stack Hosts and Routers enables mobility for the
   mobile node's IPv6 home address or prefix as well as an IPv4 home
   address, irrespective of the IP version supported on the link that
   the mobile node is attached to.  The home agent maintains binding
   cache entries for the IPv6 and IPv4 home addresses assigned to the
   mobile node when the mobile node is connected via a foreign link.
   The binding cache entries are deprecated when the mobile node
   attaches to its home link.  This document addresses an issue related
   to the de-registration procedure and the continued connectivity for
   the IPv4 home address when the mobile node attaches to its IPv6-only
   home link.

Internet-Draft   IPv4 Support for DSMIPv6 IPv6 Home Link  September 2009


1.  Introduction

   A Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 (DSMIPv6) [RFC5555] Home Agent (HA) may be
   deployed with some links that are considered by Mobile Nodes (MNs) as
   home links that are IPv6 only.  A DSMIPv6 MN may attach to its home
   link via either a physical or virtual link.  As an example, a DSMIPv6
   MN may attach to a network which deploys Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)
   [RFC5213], in which case the MN receives a Router Advertisement (RA)
   including the home-link prefix and hence would perceive to be
   connected to the home link.  The DSMIPv6 MN may also be attached via
   a 2G/3G cellular network [3GPP.23.060], in which case the link the MN
   is attached to can also be seen as the home link.  In addition to the
   MN being attached to its HA via such virtual home links, the MN may
   also attach to its HA via a physical home link of the HA.  The links
   in these examples may be in many cases IPv6 only.  Below is an
   example of the types of home links provided by a DSMIPv6 HA:

                              +------+

   In such scenarios, the provisioning of a "IPv6-only home link" for
   the MN does not imply that the IPv4 Home Address (HoA) assigned to
   the MN is also conceptually on the MN's home link.  Furthermore,

Internet-Draft   IPv4 Support for DSMIPv6 IPv6 Home Link  September 2009


   forwarding IPv4 traffic from the home agent (HA) to the MN might only
   be accomplished by tunneling it over the IPv6-only access link.  This
   basically implies that there are situations where the MN is on its
   home link (from the IPv6 point of view), but must still retain a
   Binding Cache Entry (BCE) on the HA for the IPv4 HoA in order to be
   able to send and receive IPv4 traffic.

   Since DSMIPv6 does not allow the MN to maintain a BCE for its IPv4
   HoA while being attached to the home link from the IPv6 point of view
   (as stated in Section 4.4.2.1 of [RFC5555]), this document extends
   the DSMIP6 protocol in order to allow the usage of the IPv4 HoA from
   an IPv6-only access link appearing as the "IPv6 home link" to the MN.
   By means of what is herein defined, a MN attached to an IPv6-only
   "home link" is allowed to register its own IPv6 HoA as a Care-of
   Address (CoA) for its IPv4 home address, while at the same time de-
   registering the IPv6 binding.  In such scenario, there is no
   tunneling overhead for the IPv6 traffic, and the MN is able to tunnel
   IPv4 traffic using its IPv4 HoA over the IPv6-only access link.

   Section 3 describes what occurs (as per the current DSMIPv6
   specification [RFC5555]) with the IPv4 HoA BCE that an MN registers
   on its HA while attached via a foreign network with support for IPv6,
   and then moves to an IPv6-only home link.

   Section 4 of this specification discusses the envisioned deployment
   scenarios in more detail.

   Section 5 describes how a DSMIPv6-enabled MN that is attached to a
   foreign network returns to the "IPv6-only home link" while
   maintaining IPv4 connectivity.

   Section 6 provides the details for the processing at the MN and HA


2.  Terminology

   General Mobile IPv6 related terminology is defined in [RFC3775].
   DSMIPv6 related terminology is described in [RFC5555].

   IPv6-only Home Link

      A deployment where a dual stack mobile node is attached to an
      access link that is IPv6 only and that link is viewed by the
      mobile node as its home link.

Internet-Draft   IPv4 Support for DSMIPv6 IPv6 Home Link  September 2009


3.  Problem Statement

   As stated in Section 4.4.2 of [RFC5555], the presence of the IPv4 HoA
   Option is only mandatory on the BU message for the situation where
   the MN does need to register an IPv4 HoA on the HA, otherwise its
   presence in the BU message is optional.  Section 4.4.2.1 of [RFC5555]
   also states that the MN cannot remove the IPv6 HoA BCE while
   maintaining an IPv4 HoA BCE.  From these two statements, it can be
   concluded that the presence of the IPv4 HoA Option on the BU message
   that de-registers the IPv6 HoA on the HA when the MN returns to its
   home link is not mandatory, and that independently of the presence or
   absence of the IPv4 HoA in the BU message, the HA will remove all
   bindings (both IPv6 and IPv4) for the MN.

   According to Section 2.3.1 of [RFC5555], the HA for an MN which is
   attached via a foreign link and has been assigned an IPv6 HoA as well
   as an IPv4 HoA, contains a BCE which includes both the assigned HoAs
   pointing to the MN's IPv4 or IPv6 CoA, like those defined below:

       v6HoA -> v6CoA
       v4HoA -> v6CoA

   Suppose now that the MN moves to an IPv6-only link which is viewed by
   the MN as its home link.  After determining that it has returned to
   the home link, the first action the MN takes is to send a BU to its
   HA in order to de-register the IPv6 CoA on the HA.  As the presence
   of the IPv4 HoA in the BU is optional, the MN may or may not include
   it in the BU message.  Once the HA receives this BU message and
   determines that it is a de-regisitration (by either looking for equal
   source IPv6 address and IPv6 HoA Option values OR a lifetime of
   zero), all bindings for the mobile node will be removed.  This will
   occur no matter if the Ipv4 HoA Option was present or not, as it was
   already stated that it is not allowed (by Section 4.4.2.1 of
   [RFC5555]) to have an registered IPv4 HoA without a registered IPv6
   HoA as well.

   If for instance the MN wants to keep an IPv4 HoA BCE while at the
   home network, according to what is stated on [RFC5555], the only
   possibility is to send another BU message to register the IPv4 HoA
   after receiving the Binding Acknowledgement (BAck) message for the
   preivous IPv6 de-registration event.  This creates a gap in the
   provisioning of IPv4 sevice which does not allow "seamless
   handovers", as IPv4 packets may be discarded on the HA while in the
   gap period because of the lack of the BCE for the IPv4 HoA.
   Therefore, as there is no other mechanisms currently supported in
   [RFC5555] for keeping the IPv4 binding while roaming back to the
   IPv6-only network, there is a need for extending [RFC5555] in order
   to allow "seamless handovers" for IPv4.

4.  Example Deployment Configuration

   This section describes an example scenario, where a MN's "home link"
   provides IPv6-only access.  In this scenario the HA is collocated
   with the default router, and the MN's access link (i.e. the "home
   link" from the MN point of view) is configured to support only IPv6.
   However, the HA has connectivity to IPv4/IPv6 Internet on its
   outbound interface.  Since the HA is a fully functional DSMIPv6 HA,
   it can provide IPv4 HoA and IPv4 connectivity service to the MN.  In
   this case the IPv4 home link appears as a "virtual home link" to the
   MN (meaning the MN is always attached to a foreign link from the
   Mobile IP point of view) and the MN tunnels the IPv4 traffic via its
   on-link IPv6 address to the HA, and vice versa.  However, as the MN
   is IPv6-wise at home, there is no tunnel overhead for the IPv6
   traffic.  This configuration is shown in Figure 1.

5.  Solution Overview

   Following sections describe how the Binding Update (BU) and the
   Binding Acknowledgement (BAck) messages have to be updated in order
   to avoid complete binding de-registration of both IPv4 and IPv6 Home
   Addresses (HoA) when a MN attaches to an "IPv6-only home link".
   Currently when a MN attaches to its home link, as described in
   Section 4.4.2.1. of [RFC5555] and in Sections 9.5. and 11.5.4. of
   [RFC3775]), this would cause a de-registration of all bindings for

   Tunnel flag (X)

   A new flag (X) is introduced in the Binding Update message to
   indicate a request to register the IPv6 HoA as the Care-of Address
   (CoA) for the IPv4 HoA.  The MN MAY set this flag only when it sends
   a BU message from an IPv6-only link that appears as the Mobile IPv6
   home link to the MN.  If this flag is set, the BU message MUST also
   contain the IPv4 HoA option [RFC5555] and the HA MUST retain the
   binding for the IPv4 HoA.

   Tunnel Flag (X)

   A new flag (X) is included in the BAck message to indicate that the
   HA has created the Binding Cache Entry (BCE) for the IPv4 HoA with
   the IPv6 HoA as the CoA.

5.3.  Registration Process on the Home Link

   Assume a MN has been configured with the following three addresses:

       v6HoA  MN's IPv6 home address
       v4HoA  MN's IPv4 home address
       v6HA   HA's IPv6 address

   and currently is located in an IPv6 foreign network using

       v6CoA  MN's IPv6 care-of address

   The MN has, using DSMIPv6, already made a registration with the HA
   for both of its home addresses.

   When the MN returns home to an IPv6-only home link, the MN sends the
   following packet in order to register its on-link IPv6 address as the
   CoA for the IPv4 HoA.  The usage of the Alternate Care-of Address
   option [RFC3775] while on the home link is optional and hence it may
   be omitted:


       IPv6 Header (src = v6HoA, dst = v6HA)
       ESP Header
       Mobility Header
           type = 5 (Binding Update), X-flag=1
           lifetime non-zero
           [Alternate Care-of Address option (v6HoA)]
           IPv4 Home Address option (v4HoA)

   The HA sends the following response:

       IPv6 Header (src = v6HA, dst = v6HoA)
       ESP Header
       Mobility Header
           type = 6 (Binding Acknowledgement), X-flag=1
           lifetime non-zero
           IPv4 Address Acknowledgement option (v4HoA)

   Although the packet exchange specified above seems obvious, the
   packet exchange modifies the normal semantics of bindings in two
   ways.

Internet-Draft   IPv4 Support for DSMIPv6 IPv6 Home Link  September 2009


   First, according to [RFC3775] Section 9.5, the HA when processing the
   BU will determine the specified CoA to be the address found in the
   Alternate Care-of Address option, i.e. v6HoA, or detect that the
   Alternate Care-of Address option was omitted.  Furthermore, it will
   determine the HoA to be the source address of the IPv6 header, i.e.
   v6HoA.  With this input, the HA will conclude the binding update is a
   de-registration, even if lifetime is non-zero.  When a DSMIPv6 HA
   detects a de-registration of the IPv6 home address, it releases the
   entries for both the IPv6 and IPv4 HoAs.  Therefore, the (X) flag
   introduced by this specification changes the normal semantics of
   deletion of a Binding Cache Entry (BCE) as it requires that only the
   IPv6 entry is removed.

   Another point relates to the de-registration of the IPv4 HoA from the
   IPv6-only home link.  Suppose the MN has installed the entry:

       v4HoA -> v6HoA

   in the Binding Cache (BE).  Assume the MN no longer wants IPv4
   connectivity, and wants to clear the BCE.  The MN will clear the
   entry by sending a BU message with a lifetime of zero.  This message
   is sent using v6HoA as source address.  However, the BC has no v6HoA
   entry.  This means the entry in the BCE cannot be found and cleared.

   One way to resolve this is to mandate that the MN includes the IPv4
   HoA as part of the de-registration BU message which is then used by
   the HA to locate the corresponding BCE.

   Another way to resolve this is to ensure the HA maintains a dummy
   entry for the v6HoA, such that the BC reads:

       v6HoA -> v6HoA
       v4HoA -> v6HoA

   Inserting such a dummy entry in order to bypass tunneling seems a
   substantial change of semantics.  This is essentially the same as the
   concept of the home binding described in Section 5.6.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-monami6-multiplecoa].

   The packet exchanges used above for returning to an IPv6-only home
   link are also used when the MN boots on the IPv6-only home link, or
   when making a re-registration to extend the lifetime.  They are also
   to be used when the MN is attached to the native dual stack home
   network, and discovers that the native IPv4 connectivity no longer
   works.  When the MN later discovers that IPv4 service is again
   available, the MN sends a BU with lifetime set to zero.  [ED: do not
   get this paragraph]

6.  Protocol Operation

   This specification introduces the new (X) flag in the BU and BAck
   messages.  The (X) flag in the BU message indicates a request to bind
   the IPv4 home address to the IPv6 home address as the CoA.  The (X)
   flag in BAck indicates that the HA successfully created the binding
   between the IPv4 HoA and the IPv6 HoA.

6.1.  Mobile Node Considerations

   When a DSMIPv6-enabled MN is connected to an IPv6-only home link, it
   MAY register its IPv6 HoA as the CoA for its IPv4 HoA by setting the
   (X) flag in the BU message, including the IPv4 Home Address option
   and setting the CoA in the BU message to its IPv6 HoA.  In this case
   the MN MUST tunnel any IPv4 traffic sourced from the IPv4 HoA via its
   IPv6 HoA to the HA.

   If the MN registered its IPv6 HoA as the CoA for its IPv4 HoA, the MN
   MUST maintain a BU list entry for the IPv4 HoA containing the IPv6
   HoA as the CoA.

6.2.  Home Agent Considerations

   If the MN's current CoA as received in the BU message equals the MN's
   IPv6 HoA, the HA MUST deprecate the BCE for the IPv6 HoA.  If the (X)
   flag was set and the IPv4 HoA was included in the same BU message and
   the lifetime filed is non-zero, the HA MUST update the BCE for the
   IPv4 HoA with the IPv6 HoA as the CoA.

   If the HA updated the IPv4 BCE with the IPv6 HoA as the CoA, it MUST
   set the (X) flag in the BAck message.

   When the MN registers its IPv6 HoA as the CoA for the IPv4 HoA, the
   HA MUST intercept the traffic destined to the MN's IPv4 HoA and
   tunnel it to the MN's IPv6 HoA.

   When the HA receives the BU that was sent from the "IPv6-only home
   link" and where the lifetime is set to zero, the HA releases both the
   IPv6 and IPv4 BCEs.  If no IPv6 BCE was found, but the BU message
   contains the IPv4 HoA, the HA MUST use the IPv4 HoA from the BU
   message to locate the corresponding IPv4 BCE and release it.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document recommends that the same level of security is applied
   to the packets sent natively to/from the MN's on-link home address
   and to the packets on the virtual home link that are tunneled to the

   MN's on-link home address.


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new flag (X) in the Binding Update
   and Binging Acknowledgement messages from the RFC3775 Binding Update
   Flags and the RFC3775 Binding Acknowledgment Flags registries.
