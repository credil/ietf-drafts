      Information model for G.709 Optical Transport Networks (OTN)
                draft-bccg-ccamp-otn-g709-info-model-00

Abstract

   The recent revision of ITU-T recommendation G.709 [G.709-v3] has
   introduced new fixed and flexible ODU containers in Optical Transport
   Networks (OTNs), enabling optimized support for an increasingly
   abundant service mix.

   This document provides a model of information needed by the routing
   process in OTNs to support Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) control of all currently defined ODU containers both at sub-
   lambdas and lambda level granularity.

1.  Introduction

   An Opaque OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) LSA (Link State
   Advertisements) carrying application-specific information can be
   generated and advertised to other nodes following the flooding
   procedures defined in [RFC5250].  Three types of opaque LSA are
   defined, i.e. type 9 - link-local flooding scope, type 10 - area-
   local flooding scope, type 11 - AS flooding scope.

   Traffic Engineering(TE) LSA using type 10 opaque LSA is defined in
   [RFC3630] for TE purpose.  This type of LSA is composed of a standard
   LSA header and a payload including one top-level TLV and possible
   several nested sub-TLVs.  [RFC3630]defines two top-level TLVs: Router
   Address TLV and Link TLV; and nine possible sub-TLVs for the Link
   TLV, used to carry link related TE information.  The Link type sub-
   TLVs are enhanced by [RFC4203] in order to support GMPLS networks and
   related specific link information.  In GMPLS networks each node
   generates TE LSAs to advertise its TE information and capabilities
   (link-specific or node-specific)through the network.  The TE
   information carried in the LSAs are collected by the other nodes of
   the network and stored into their local Traffic Engineering Databases
   (TED).

   In a GMPLS enabled G.709 Optical Transport Networks (OTN), routing is
   fundamental in order to allow automatic calculation of routes for
   ODUk LSPs signaled via RSVP-TE protocol.  The recent revision of
   ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G709-V3] has introduced new fixed and
   flexible ODU containers that augment those specified in foundation
   OTN.  As a result, it is necessary to provide OSPF routing protocol
   extensions to allow Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) control of all currently
   defined ODU containers, in support of sub-lambda and lambda level
   routing granularity.

   This document provides a model of information needed by the routing
   process in OTNs to support Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) control of all currently defined ODU containers both at sub-
   lambdas and lambda level granularity.

   OSPF requirements are defined in [OTN-FWK], while protocol extensions
   are defined in [OTN-OSPF].


2.  OSPF requirements overview

   OTN serves as the convergence layer for transporting a wide range of
   services, including those whose bit rates do not allow efficient
   usage of the entire bandwidth associated with a single lambda.  In
   such a case OTN allows aggregation (and recovery) of traffic to

Internet-Draft       Information model for G.709 OTN           June 2010


   support optimization of overall network bandwidth allocation; i.e.,
   OTN allows the aggregate service rate to be decoupled from the OTN
   line system capacity.

   Thus, it is necessary to define a scalable control plane solution
   that is able to fully exploit OTN flexibility (both in terms of
   aggregation and survivability).

   [Ed note] (could be part of Framework but for the moment can provide
   introduction to the overview)

   In this scope, Section 5.3 of the [draft-fwk] provides a set of
   functional routing requirements.  These requirements are summarized
   below :

      - Support for link multiplexing capability advertisement: The
      routing protocol has to be able to carry information regarding the
      capability of an OTU link to support different type of ODUs

      - Support for TS granularity advertisement: Each ODUj can be
      multiplexed into an OTUk using different TS granularities.  For
      example, ODU1 can be multiplexed into ODU2 with either 2.5Gbps TS
      granularity or 1.25G TS granularity.  The routing protocol should
      be capable of carrying the TS granularity supported by the ODU
      interface.

      - Support of any ODUk and ODUflex: The routing protocol must be
      capable of carrying the required link bandwidth information for
      performing accurate route computation for any of the fixed rate
      ODUs as well as ODUflex.

      - Support for differentiation between link multiplexing capacity
      and link rate capacity

      - Support different priorities for resource reservation.  How many
      priorities levels should be supported depends on operator
      policies.  Therefore, the routing protocol should be capable of
      supporting either no priorities or up to 8 priority levels as
      defined in [RFC4202].

      - Support link bundling either at the same line rate or different
      line rates (e.g. 40G and 10G).  Bundling links at different rates
      makes the control plane more scalable and permits better
      networking flexibility.

3.  G.709 Digital Layer TE Information and Requirement Analysis

   Some types of ODUs (i.e., ODU1, ODU2, ODU3, ODU4) may assume either a
   client or server role within the context of a particular networking
   domain.  ITU-T G.872 amendment 2 provides two tables definig mapping
   and multiplexing capabilities of OTNs.  Such tables are shown
   hereinafter.

                   Figure 2: OTN multiplexing capability

   An ODUk mapped directly into an OTUk server in a particular
   networking domain, only uses the line rate capacity (OTUk capacity)
   and cannot be further electrically multiplexed.  Within this draft,
   the term "line rate LSP" refers to the role of an ODU that has been
   mapped directly into an OTU server (e.g., a line rate 10Gbit/s can
   only traverse OTU2 links).  A line rate LSP always has a capacity
   equivalent to a single lambda and may be carried over one or more
   wavelength sub-networks connected by optical links.

   Within a particular networking domain, ODUs that are further
   electrically multiplexed into higher order ODUs may be carried over
   various types of links.  The term "service rate LSP" may be used for
   describing the role of an ODU that will be further multiplexed within
   the networking domain.

   In other words, ODUs serving various roles may change in traversing a

   network; i.e., "service rate" LSP roles (used to carry client
   traffic) and "line rate" LSP roles (used to build infrastructure).
   These roles must be considered and distinguished from a path
   computation perspective.  As detailed in [OTN-FWK], client ODUs can
   be carried over:

      o Case A) one or more wavelength sub-networks connected by optical
      links or

      o Case B) a line rate LSP or

      o Case C) a mix of line rate LSPs and wavelength sub-networks.

   This document only considers the TE information needed for ODU path
   computation, considering both service and line rate LSP roles.

   The following sections list and analyze each type of data that needs
   to be advertised in order to support path computation.

3.1.  Tributary Slot type

   ITU-T recommendations define two types of TS but, each link can only
   work under one of them.  The rules to be followed when selecting the
   TS to be used are:

      - if both ends of a link can support both 2.5Gbps TS and 1.25Gbps
      TS, then the link will work under 1.25Gbps TS.

      - If one end can support the 1.25Gbps TS, and another end the
      2.5Gbps TS, the link will work under 2.5Gbps TS

   In addition, the bandwidth accounting depends on the type of TS.
   Therefore, the type of the TS should be known during LO ODU path
   computation.  Currently such information is not provided by the
   routing protocol.

3.2.  Sygnal type

   [RFC 4328] allows advertising G.709 foundation (single TS) without
   the capability of providing precise information about bandwidth
   special allocation.  For example, in case of link bundling, dividing
   the unreserved bandwidth by the max LSP bandwidth it is not possible
   to know the exact number of LSPs at max LSP bandwidth size that can
   be set up.

   The lack of spatial allocation heavily impacts the restoration
   process, because the lack of information of free resources highly
   increases the number of crank-backs affecting network convergence

Internet-Draft       Information model for G.709 OTN           June 2010


   time.

   Moreover actual tools provided by OSPF-TE only allow advertising
   signal types with fixed bandwidth and implicit hierarchy (e.g.  SDH/
   SONET networks) or variable bandwidth with no hierarchy (e.g. packet
   switching networks) but do not provide the means for advertising
   networks with mixed approach (e.g.  ODUflex CBR and ODUflex packet).

   For example, advertising ODU0 as MIN LSP bandwith and ODU4 as MAX LSP
   bandwidth it is not possible to state whether the advertised link
   supports ODU4 and ODUFlex or ODU4, ODU3, ODU2, ODU1, ODU0 and
   ODUFlex.  Such ambiguity is not present in SDH networks where the
   hierarchy is implicit and flexible containers like ODUFlex do not
   exist.  Moreover with the current IETF solutions, ([RFC4202],
   [RFC4203]) as soon as no bandwidth is available for a certain signal
   type it is not advertised into the related ISCD, losing also the
   related capability until bandwidth is freed.

   Supposing for example to have an equivalent ODU-2 unreserved
   bandwidth in a TE-link (with bundling capability) distributed on 4
   ODU-1, it would be advertised via the ISCD in this way:

      Max LSP Bw: ODU1

      Min LSP Bw: ODU1

      - Maximum Reservable Bandwidth (of the bundle) set to ODU2

      - Unreserved Bandwidth (of the bundle) set to ODU2

   In conclusion, the OSPF-TE extensions defined in [RFC4203] require a
   different ISCD per signal type in order to advertise each supported
   container.  With respect to link bundling, the utilization of the
   ISCD as it is, would not allow precise advertising of spatial
   bandwidth allocation information unless using only one component link
   per TE link.

3.3.  Unreserved Resources

   Unreserved resources need to be advertised per priority and per
   signal type in order to allow the correct functioning of the
   restoration process.  [RFC4203] only allows advertising unreserved
   resources per priority, this leads not to know how many LSPs of a
   specific signal type can be restored.  As example it is possible to
   consider the scenario depicted in the following figure.

                  |      +------------------+      |
                  |      | component link 2 |      |
                  |  N1  +------------------+  N2  |
                  |      | component link 3 |      |
                  |      +------------------+      |
                  +------+                  +---+--+


                   Figure 3: Concurrent path computation

   Suppose to have a TE link comprising 3 ODU3 component links with
   32TSs available on the first one, 24TSs on the second, 24TSs on the
   third and supporting ODU2 and ODU3 signal types.  The node would
   advertise a TE link unreserved bandwidth equal to 80 TSs and a MAX
   LSP bandwidth equal to 32 TSs.  In case of restoration the network
   could try to restore 2 ODU3 (64TSs) in such TE-link while only a
   single ODU3 can be set up and a crank-back would be originated.  In
   more complex network scenarios the number of crank-backs can be much
   higher.

3.4.  Maximum LSP Bandwidth

   Maximum LSP bandwidth is currently advertised in the common part of
   the ISCD and advertised per priority, while in OTN networks it is
   only required for ODUflex advertising.  This leads to a significant
   waste of bits inside each LSA.

3.5.  Distinction between multiplexing and line rate capacity

   The distinction between line rate and multiplexing capacity is a
   requirement as per [OTN-FWK].  [RFC4203] could achieve this
   distinction advertising different bandwidths for OTUk and ODUk signal
   types.  This approach implies the usage of multiple ISCDs and
   therefore it is not efficient.  For example a link with line rate
   capacity OTU3 and multiplexing capacity ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3,
   [RFC4203] would require the utilization of four different ISCDs, one
   for each capability.

3.6.  Priority Support

   The IETF foresees that up to eight priorities must be supported and
   that all of them have to be advertised independently on the number of
   priorities supported by the implementation.  Considering that the
   advertisement of all the different supported signal types will
   originate large LSAs, it is advised to advertise only the information
   related to the really supported priorities.
