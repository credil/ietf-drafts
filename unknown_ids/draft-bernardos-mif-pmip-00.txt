Abstract

   Netlmm WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  PMIPv6 enables
   mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across gateways
   without changing the IP address.  PMIPv6 also provides limited multi-
   homing support to multi-mode mobile devices.  Recently Netext WG is
   being chartered to work on optimizations for PMIPv6.  While multi-
   homing item has been proposed to be part of the approved charter,
   discussions showed there are still many controversial issues to be
   addressed (i.e. the no-host modification theorem).  This document,
   leveraging parallel activities in the MIF WG, explores solutions for
   the multi-homing use case aiming at helping Netext community where
   possible.

Internet-Draft             PMIPv6 multihoming                  July 2009


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in RFC 5213 [RFC5213], provides
   network based mobility management to hosts connecting to a PMIPv6
   domain.  PMIPv6 introduces two new functional entities, the Local
   Mobility Anchor (LMA) and the Mobility Access Gateway (MAG).  The MAG
   is the first layer three hop detecting Mobile Node (MN) attachment
   and providing IP connectivity.  The LMA is the entity assigning one
   or more Home Network Prefixes (HNPs) to the MN and is the topological
   anchor for all traffic from/to the MN.

   PMIPv6 allows an MN to connect to the same PMIPv6 domain through
   different interfaces.  ID
   [I-D.devarapalli-netext-multi-interface-support] identifies at least
   three possible scenarios, namely i) unique prefix per interface, ii)
   same prefix but different global addresses per interface, iii) shared
   address across multiple interfaces.  The ID further describes issues
   associated with each scenario.  The first two scenarios are similar,
   and bring similar issues, whereas the third one is more complex to
   tackle, since it requires to deal with the sharing of the same IP
   address across different interfaces.  This document focuses on the
   two first scenarios, as depicted in Figure 1.

    Figure 1: Unique prefix and Unique address per Interface scenarios

   In parallel to this, the Multiple Interfaces (MIF) WG has been
   chartered to describe host issues upon attachment to multiple
   networks and document existing practice.  This work has been
   triggered based on the fact that many hosts currently have the

   ability to attach to multiple networks simultaneously, and that
   implies benefits (e.g., enables load balancing, improved
   connectivity, higher throughput and better reliability, etc.), but
   also brings some operation issues (e.g., default router selection,
   address selection, DNS server selection, choice of interface for
   packet transmission, the treatment of configuration information
   received from the various networks, etc.).  Configuration decisions
   about how to deal with the different information from each of the
   interface might have a very strong impact on the connectivity
   experienced by a MIF node.

   In the context of PMIPv6, current specification [RFC5213] does not
   address the case of a MIF node attaching to a PMIPv6 domain.  We
   argue it is important to enable PMIPv6 to bring MIF nodes the
   advantages related to the simultaneous use of multiple interfaces.
   Moreover a MIF node could be seen as a not-modified host implementing
   the right technology for multi-interface handling.


2.  MIF scope and PMIPv6

   Current scope of MIF WG only covers the issues of host attaching to
   multiple networks.  The WG is focused on documenting the system level
   effects to host IP stacks and identification of gaps between the
   existing IETF recommendations and existing practice, both for IPv4
   and IPv6.

   While the MIF WG is not addressing any (neither flow nor host nor
   network) mobility, a MIF node might find itself connected to a PMIPv6
   domain.  PMIPv6 should be extended to efficiently support MIF nodes
   attaching to a PMIPv6 domain, enabling features such as the ones
   identified in [I-D.jeyatharan-netext-multihoming-ps], e.g., dynamic
   mobility sessions between different interfaces, allowing traffic to
   be forwarded to any of the interfaces of a MIF node, not only to the
   one configured with the destination prefix/address of that traffic).


3.  A use case

   This section describes a simple use case of a MIF node in a PMIPv6
   domain, as an example of a situation where PMIPv6 needs to be
   extended.

                            Figure 2: Use case

   Figure 2 shows a potential use case of interest involving an MIF
   mobile node attached to a PMIPv6 domain.  The MN is attached to MAG1
   through its WLAN interface (if1), and to MAG2 through its 3G
   interface (if2).  Lets consider the case in which each interface has
   been assigned a different prefix by the LMA.  Two different mobility
   bindings are created in the LMA referring to the MN.  In this
   scenario, if the MN decides to move if1 from MAG1 to a different MAG
   of the same domain, the PMIPv6 support would take care of ensuring
   that the same prefix (pref1) is assigned at the new MAG (we assume
   that there is an L2 identifier for if1 that the new MAG can include
   in the PBU).

   Lets assume for the sake of this example that the MN starts a
   communication with CN1, using as source IPv6 address (pref1::if1) the
   one assigned to its WLAN interface (if1), and that it also starts a
   different communication with CN2, using as source IPv6 address
   (pref2::if2) the one assigned to its 3G interface (if2).  In this
   scenario, it would be useful to enable the MN be able to receive
   traffic addressed to pref1::if1 via if2 and vice versa.  However,
   current PMIPv6 specification does not support this.  Analogously, it
   would be also useful to allow the MN send traffic with source address

   pref1::if2 through if2 and vice versa.

   We argue in the next section that PMIPv6 could benefit from MIF
   outcomes to support the previous scenario while limiting impact on
   the LMA and MAG operation.


4.  Considerations on feasibility. Approach overview

   We analyse in the next sections the feasibility of the scenario
   presented in Section 3, by identifying the requirements and changes
   that would be needed in PMIPv6 to support it.  In this version of the
   document we do not specify with all the required details the
   solution, but rather concentrate on the concept, with the goal of
   triggering the discussion within MIF and NETEXT WGs.

   Figure 3 shows in a glimpse the extensions to PMIPv6 required to
   support the MIF example scenario shown in Section 3.

Internet-Draft             PMIPv6 multihoming                  July 2009


4.1.  MN considerations

   In order to support the reception of traffic addressed to pref1::if1
   at the interface if2, the MN MUST follow the Weak host model
   [RFC1122], [I-D.thaler-ip-model-evolution].  This model does not
   limit traffic reception at a host only to IP packets whose
   destination address matches the IP address assigned to the interface
   receiving the packets, but allows to receive and process packets
   whose IP destination address corresponds to that of any of the local
   interfaces of the host.

   By implementing the Weak host model, the MN in Figure 3 would be able
   to process traffic addressed to any of its IP addresses (i.e.,
   pref1::if1 and pref2::if2), no matter to which interface that traffic
   arrives to.

   We have performed some tests with different operating systems, and
   the results show that both Linux (tested with Linux-2.6.26) and Mac
   OS X (tested with Leopard) implements the Weak host model for both
   IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.  We have not performed tests with Windows, but
   some results have been reported in [I-D.mrw-mif-current-practices].
   It should be noted that Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 use the
   weak host model for sends and receives for all IPv4 interfaces and
   the strong host model for sends and receives for all IPv6 interfaces.
   This behavior cannot be modified.  The Next Generation TCP/IP stack
   in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 supports strong host sends
   and receives for both IPv4 and IPv6 by default on all interfaces.
   The stack can be configured to use weak host model.

   Generally it should be possible to enable automatic configuration of
   the weak model during network attachment/entry according to policies
   configured in the operator's network.  Signaling exchanged between
   the MAG and the LMA (PUB, PBA) needs to be extended to configure the
   MN (via RS/RA or DHCP) to use the weak host model on a specific
   interface.  As an example according to RFC 5175 [RFC5175] a bit can
   be assigned in the RA message indicating such option.  Alternatively,
   the access provider may decide to configure the MAGs to advertise the
   MN for weak model configuration.

4.2.  LMA considerations

   The LMA MUST be able to identify all the mobility bindings at its BC
   that refer to the same MN, using the MN-identifier.  The LMA SHOULD
   have an additional policy/routing table.  This table is used by the
   LMA to store and look up information about how to route packets to a
   certain MN.  With current PMIPv6 specification, the LMA decides on
   the next hop towards a particular MN based only on the destination
   prefix (that would result on an outgoing tunnel interface to reach



Bernardos, et al.        Expires January 4, 2010                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             PMIPv6 multihoming                  July 2009


   the MAG where that prefix is currently reachable).  In order to allow
   the LMA to dynamically decide which is the best path for a certain
   traffic to reach the MN, a policy/routing table SHOULD be used.  By
   using this table, the LMA would be able to send different flows
   addressed to the same destination IP address (e.g. pref1::if1) via
   different MAGs.

4.3.  MAG considerations

   The MAG MUST support routing packets addressed to MNs locally
   attached to the MAG, but using a destination address that is not on-
   link.  In order to do that, the MAG SHOULD be informed by the LMA
   about the set of IP addresses that the MN has acquired from the
   PMIPv6 domain, so the MAG can add the required entries on its routing
   table.  The PBA MAY be extended to include such information.

4.4.  Downlink (DL) and Uplink (UL) considerations

   The extensions outlined in this document would allow an MN to
   simultaneously receive traffic through all of its interfaces that are
   attached to the same PMIPv6 domain.  Enabling such a feature in the
   Downlink (DL) makes sense when several access networks are available
   at the same time, as for example in heterogeneous PMIPv6 domains
   where several access technologies exhibiting different DL capacities
   are found (e.g., WLAN and 3G).

   Enabling the feature on the Uplink (UL) is also possible.  Enabling
   the network (i.e., the LMA) to have the control on which MN's
   outgoing interface it used for a certain flow requires changes on the
   MN side, as well as signalling on the MN-AR interface.  Nevertheless,
   if the decision is on the MN side, this might be easily supported by
   the solution outlined in this document, by properly configuring the
   routing and ingress filtering at the MAGs.

   The mapping of a flow to an interface may be driven by the terminal,
   the LMA or both:

   1.  driven by the terminal: the terminal establishes the policy and
       selects the interface to send packets.  The LMA must be aware of
       the flow/interface mapping policy to keep consistency in routing
       (the terminal would expect receiving traffic on a specific
       interface).  So the terminal may provide its policy to the LMA.

   2.  driven by the LMA: the LMA have the control on which MN's
       outgoing interface is used for a certain flow.  In such a case
       the MN's routing table is updated according to the policy which
       must be provided to the MN by the LMA.

Internet-Draft             PMIPv6 multihoming                  July 2009


   3.  MN driven but assisted by the LMA: the terminal controls the
       mapping of the flows to the possible interfaces.  However the LMA
       provides some default policies which can be updated by the MN.
       The policies must be exchanged in both directions (from LMA to MN
       and vice versa).
