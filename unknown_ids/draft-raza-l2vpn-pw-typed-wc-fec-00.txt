Internet-Draft       LDP Typed Wildcard PW FEC Elements      April 2010


Abstract 

   An extension to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) defines the 
   general notion of a "Typed Wildcard Forwarding Equivalence Class 
   (FEC) Element"".  This can be used when it is desired to request all
   label bindings for a given type of FEC Element, or to release or 
   withdraw all label bindings for a given type of FEC element.  
   However, a typed wildcard FEC element must be individually defined 
   for each type of FEC element.  This specification defines the typed 
   wildcard FEC elements for the Pseudowire Identifier (PW Id) and 
   Generalized Pseudowire Identifier (Gen. PW Id) FEC types. 

Conventions used in this document 

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1. Introduction 

   An extension [TYPED-WC] to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) 
   [RFC5036] defines the general notion of a "Typed Wildcard Forwarding
   Equivalence Class (FEC) Element".  This can be used when it is 
   desired to request all label bindings for a given type of FEC 
   Element, or to release or withdraw all label bindings for a given 
   type of FEC element.  However, a typed wildcard FEC element must be 
   individually defined for each type of FEC element. 

   [RFC4447] defines the "PWid FEC Element" and "Generalized PWid FEC 
   Element" but it does not specify Typed Wildcard format for these 
   elements. This document specifies the format of the Typed Wildcard 
   FEC for the "PWid FEC Element" and the "Generalized PWid FEC 
   Element" defined in [RFC4447]. The procedures for Typed Wildcard 
   processing for PWid and Generalized PWid FEC Elements are same as 
   described in [TYPED-WC] for any typed wildcard FEC Element type.

Internet-Draft       LDP Typed Wildcard PW FEC Elements      April 2010


2. Typed Wildcard for PWid FEC Element 

   The format of the PWid FEC Typed Wildcard FEC is: 

    0                   1                   2 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   | Typed Wcard   | Type = PWid   |   Len = 0     | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   Figure 1: Format of PWid Typed Wildcard FEC Element 

   where:  

     Typed Wcard (one octet): as specified in [TYPED-WC]     

     FEC Element Type (one octet): PWid FEC Element (type 0x80 
       [RFC4447]) 

     Len FEC Type Info (one octet):  Zero. (There is no additional FEC 
       info) 

  3. Typed Wildcard for Generalized PWid FEC Element 

   The format of the Generalized PWid FEC Typed Wildcard FEC is: 

    0                   1                   2 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3   
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   | Typed Wcard   | Type=Gen.PWid |   Len = 0     | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   Figure 2: Format of Generalized PWid Typed Wildcard FEC Element     

   where:   

     Typed Wcard (one octet): as specified in [TYPED-WC]     

     FEC Element Type (one octet): Generalized PWid FEC Element (type 
       0x81 [RFC4447]) 

     Len FEC Type Info (one octet):  Zero. (There is no additional FEC 
       info) 

  When Generalized PWid FEC Typed Wildcard is used, "PW Grouping ID 
  TLV" [RFC4447] MUST NOT be present in the same message.  

4. Security Considerations 

  No new security considerations beyond that apply to the base LDP 
  specification [RFC5036], [RFC4447] and [MPLS_SEC] apply to the use of
  the PW Typed Wildcard FEC Element types described in this document.
