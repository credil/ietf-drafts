             RTCP Report Extension for Feedback Suppression
             draft-wu-avt-retransmission-supression-rtp-05

Abstract

   When packet loss close to the media source or intermediary of the
   session is detected as a loss by a large number of receivers, large
   number of feedback requests used to ask for the lost RTP packets are
   all addressed to the same media source, or a designated feedback
   target.  This may result in a phenomenon known variously as a
   "feedback storm " or "feedback implosion ".

   This document specifies an extension to the RTCP feedback messages
   defined in the Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF).  This
   extension allows an intermediate node in the network (such as an RTP
   translator) inform downstream receivers that packet loss was detected
   and sending a feedback message concerning a specified set of RTP
   packets may be unnecessary, or even harmful.  Receivers respond to
   receipt of a feedback suppression message by not sending a feedback
   message (e.g. a NACK) that they otherwise would, This in turn reduces
   load on both the feedback target and on the network.  The proposed
   extension is useful for single-source multicast sessions.  In
   addition, it can be applied to any other types of RTP sessions and
   topologies that might benefit from feedback suppression mechanism.

Internet-Draft            Feedback Suppression              October 2010


1.  Introduction

   RTCP feedback messages [RFC4585]allow the receivers in an RTP session
   to report events and ask for action from the media source (or a
   delegated feedback target).  There are cases where multiple receivers
   may initiate the same, or an equivalent message towards the same
   media source.  When the receiver count is large, this behavior may
   overload the media source or the network or both.  One common case is
   receivers utilizing RTP retransmission as a packet loss recovery
   technique in a real-time application such as streaming video or
   audio.[RFC4585]Feedback is accomplished using the RTCP NACK message
   which conveys the RTP sequence number(s) of the lost packet(s).  This
   information can then be used by the media or distribution source to
   retransmit the missing RTP packets using the RTP retransmission
   payload format[RFC4588].

   However, in topologies utilizing transport translators (Topo-Trn-
   Translator) or large-scale multicast transmission (Topo-Multicast) as
   defined in [RFC5117], packet loss can occur on either an upstream
   link or a downstream aggregate link of the intermediate network
   element (e.g., Distribution Source, MCU, Transport Translator).
   Where there are many receivers, this may result in a Feedback
   implosion [RFC5740] towards the media or distribution source, i.e.,
   large number of feedback requests to the same multicast sender for
   retransmission of the same RTP packets.  This phenomenon goes by a
   number of alternate names, such as the "feedback storm" or the "NACK
   storm" terminology of [DVB-IPTV].  In an attempt to increase its
   robustness against the loss of a feedback message or of
   retransmission packets, a receiver may send multiple feedbacks for
   the same detected packet loss, which may aggravate the feedback
   implosion.

   Another use case involves video Fast Update requests.  A storm of
   these feedback messages can occur in conversational multimedia
   scenarios like Topo-Video-switch-MCU [RFC5117].  In this scenario,
   packet loss may happen on an upstream link of an intermediate network
   element such as a Multipoint Control Unit(MCU).  Receivers missing
   the packets issue fast update requests (i.e., Full Intra Request(FIR)
   described in [RFC5104]), which results in an implosion of FIR
   requests from receivers to the same media source.

   As these feedback storms propagate (e.g., NACK implosion or Fast
   update implosion), the network may be permeated with more and more
   feedback traffic, resulting in a positive feedback loop as the
   network is also saturated with media traffic.  RTCP feedback storms
   may cause short term overload and, and in extreme cases to pose a
   possible risk of increasing network congestion on the control channel
   (e.g.  RTCP feedback), the data channel (i.e.  RTP retransmission),

   or Both if the receivers are not correctly implemented

   In order to mitigate these behaviors, the current text in [RFC5760]
   allows the distribution source to filter out the NACK messages and
   [DVB-IPTV] suggests sending a NACK message from server to the client
   (or receiver).  However NACK is defined as a receiver report sent
   from a client to the server and therefore exhibits a semantic
   mismatch when used as a suppression indication from the server (or
   intermediary) to the client.  This document instead specifies a newly
   message for this function.  It further is more precise in the
   intended uses and less likely to be confusing to receivers.  It tells
   receivers explicitly that feedback for a particular packet loss is
   not needed and can provide an early indication before the receiver
   reacts to the loss and invokes its packet loss repair machinery.

   Receivers respond to receipt of a feedback suppression message by not
   sending a feedback message (e.g. a NACK) that they otherwise would,
   This in turn reduces load on both the feedback target and on the
   network.

   Also the intermediate node may initiate its own feedback toward the
   media source to provoke a retransmission.  When the media source
   receives the request from the intermediate node, the media source
   resends the lost packets to the receivers by using the RTP
   retransmission payload format [RFC4588] or resends a new refresh
   point for FIR Initiator [RFC5104], depending on the type of feedback
   it received.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Protocol Overview

   This document extends the RTCP feedback messages defined in the
   Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF) and define the Feedback
   Suppression message.  The Feedback Suppression message asks a
   receiver to not send feedback messages for particular packets
   (indicated by their RTP sequence numbers) independent of whether the
   receiver detected the packet loss or detected a need for a decoder
   refresh point).

   In order to detect packet loss before the receivers perceive it, one
   or more intermediate nodes are placed between the media source and



Wu, et al.               Expires April 23, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            Feedback Suppression              October 2010


   receiver (e.g., Distribution server, MCU, RTP translator).  These
   intermediaries monitor for packet loss upstream of themselves by
   checking RTP sequence numbers, just as receivers do.  Upon detecting
   (or suspecting) an upstream loss, the intermediary may send Feedback
   Suppression message towards the receivers as defined in this
   specification.

   These intermediate nodes need to take into account such factors as
   the tolerable application delay, the network dynamics, and the media
   type.  When the packet loss is detected upstream of the intermediary
   and additional latency is tolerable, the intermediate node may itself
   send a feedback message asking for the suspected lost packet or ask
   for the correct decoder refresh point.  Because it has already
   provided the necessary feedback toward the source, the intermediate
   node can be reasonably certain that it will help the situation by
   sending a Feedback Suppression message to all the relevant receivers,
   thereby indicating that the receivers should not themselves transmit
   feedback messages.

   When the receiver receives such Feedback Suppression message, if the
   receiver understands this message it will not send packet loss
   request (e.g., NACK) for the missing packets reported in the message.
   If it did not understand this new message, the host MAY send packet
   loss request(i.e., Feedback messages) to the specified media source.
   A receiver may still have sent a Feedback message before receiving a
   feedback suppression message, but further feedback messages for those
   sequence numbers will be suppressed by this technique.

   RTCP Feedback Suppression follows the same semantic model as RTCP
   NACK - it conveys the packet receipt/loss events at the sequence
   number level and considers missing packets as unrepaired.  But unlike
   RTCP NACK, the Feedback Suppression messages can be generated at
   intermediate nodes who are not RTP receivers and sent to the
   corresponding receivers.  Intermediaries downstream of an
   intermediary detecting loss obviously SHOULD NOT initiate their own
   additional feedback suppression messages for the same packet sequence
   numbers.  They may either simply forward the Feedback Suppression
   message received from upstream, or augment (or replace) it with a
   feedback suppression message that reflects the loss pattern they have
   themselves seen.

   Since feedback suppression interacts strongly with repair timing, it
   has to work together with feedback to not adversely impact the repair
   of lost source packets.  In some cases where the loss was detected
   and repair initiated much closer to the source, the delay for the
   receiver to recover from packet loss can be reduced through the
   combination of intermediary feedback to the source and feedback
   suppression downstream.  In all (properly operating) cases, the risk

   of increasing network congestion is decreased.

   This document registers two new RTCP Feedback messages for Feedback
   Suppression.  Applications that are employing one or more loss-repair
   methods MAY use Feedback Suppression together with their existing
   loss-repair methods either for every packet they expect to receive,
   or for an application-specific subset of the RTP packets in a
   session.  In other words, receivers MAY ignore Feedback Suppression
   messages, but SHOULD react to them unless they have good reason to
   still send feedback messages despite having been requested to
   suppress them.


4.  RTCP Feedback Report Extension

4.1.  Transport Layer Feedback:  NACK Suppression Report

   The NACK implosion Suppression message is an extension to the RTCP
   feedback report and identified by RTCP packet type value PT=RTPFB and
   FMT=TBD.

   The FCI field MUST contain one or more NACK Suppression Early
   Indication (NSEI) entries.  Each entry applies to a different media
   source, identified by its SSRC.

   The Feedback Control Information (FCI) for NSEI uses the similar
   format of message Types defined in the section 4.3.1.1 of [RFC5104].
   The format is shown in Figure 1.

   Packet ID (PID): 16 bits

      The PID field is used to specify a lost packet.  The PID field
      refers to the RTP sequence number of the lost packet.

   bitmask of following lost packets (BLP): 16 bits

      The BLP allows for reporting losses of any of the 16 RTP packets
      immediately following the RTP packet indicated by the PID.  The
      BLP's definition is identical to that given in [RFC4585].


4.2.  Payload Specific Feedback: FIR suppression report

   The FIR implosion Suppression message is an extension to the RTCP
   receiver feedback report and identified by RTCP packet type value
   PT=PSFB and FMT=TBD.

   The FCI field MUST contain one or more FIR suppression Early
   Indication (FSEI) entries.  Each entry applies to a different media
   source, identified by its SSRC.

   The Feedback Control Information (FCI) for FSEI uses the similar
   format of message Types defined in the section 4.3.1.1 of [RFC5104].
   The format is shown in Figure 2.

5.  SDP Signaling

   A new feedback value "fss" needs to be defined for the Feedback Storm
   Suppression message to be used with Session Description Protocol
   (SDP)[RFC4566] using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)[RFC4585].

   The "fss" feedback value SHOULD be used with parameters that indicate
   the feedback suppression supported.  In this document, we define two
   such parameters, namely:

   o  "fsei" denotes support of fir suppression early indication (fsei).

   o  "nsei" denotes support of NACK suppression early indication.

   In the ABNF for rtcp-fb-val defined in [RFC4585], there is a
   placeholder called rtcp-fb-id to define new feedback types. "fss" is
   defined as a new feedback type in this document, and the ABNF for the
   parameters for fss is defined here (please refer to section 4.2 of
   [RFC4585] for complete ABNF syntax).

      rtcp-fb-val        =/ "fss" rtcp-fb-fss-param
      rtcp-fb-fss-param  = SP "nsei";nack suppression early indication
                          / SP "fsei";fir suppression early indication
                          / SP token [SP byte-string]
                                    ; for future commands/indications
         byte-string = <as defined in section 4.2 of [RFC4585] >

   Refer to Section 4.2 of [RFC4585] for a detailed description and the
   full syntax of the "rtcp-fb" attribute.


6.  Example Use Cases

   The operation of feedback suppression is similar for all types of RTP
   sessions and topologies [RFC5117], however the exact messages used
   and the scenarios in which suppression is employed differ for various
   use cases.  The following sections outline the intended use cases for
   feedback suppression and give an overview of the particular
   mechanisms.

Internet-Draft            Feedback Suppression              October 2010


6.1.  Source Specific Multicast (SSM) use case

   In SSM RTP sessions as described in [RFC5760], one or more Media
   Sources send RTP packets to a Distribution Source.  The Distribution
   Source relays the RTP packets to the receivers using a source-
   specific multicast group.

   In order to avoid the forms of NACK implosion described in section
   1,the distribution source SHOULD choose to include the support for
   loss detection.  How the packet loss detection works is beyond of
   scope of this document.  When upstream link or downstream aggregate
   link packet loss occurs, the distribution source creates a Feedback
   Suppression report and sent it to all the RTP receivers, over the
   multicast channel.  Another possibility is when there may have
   multiple distribution source placed between the media source and the
   receivers, the upstream distribution source MAY inform downstream
   distribution source of the detected packet loss using Feedback
   Suppression messages.  In response, the distribution source forwards
   packet loss suppression report received from upstream to all the RTP
   receivers, over the multicast channel.  This loss suppression report
   tells the receivers that the lost packet will either be forthcoming
   from distribution source, or it irretrievably lost such that there is
   nothing to be gained by the receiver sending a NACK to the media
   source.  The distribution source then can (optionally) ask for the
   lost packets from the media source on behalf of all the RTP
   receivers.

   When there is only one distribution source with loss detection
   support between the media source and the receivers, redistribution of
   the feedback suppression report to all the receivers is trivial.
   When there are multiple distribution sources between the media source
   and the receiver, , each distribution source with loss detection
   support MAY create a Feedback Suppression Report using the similar
   format as conventional RTCP NACK packets at the RTP layer and send it
   to its downstream distribution source or forward one Feedback
   Suppression Report from upstream to its downstream distribution
   source or the receivers.  Also each distribution source at the
   downstream of the other distribution source MAY also append non-
   identical packet loss information into the Feedback Suppression
   Report sent from upstream and form one summary report and send it to
   the receivers.

   The distribution source must be able to communicate with all group
   members in order for either mechanism to be effective at suppressing
   feedback.

   As outlined in the [RFC5760], there are two Unicast Feedback models
   that may be used for reporting, - the Simple Feedback model and the

Internet-Draft            Feedback Suppression              October 2010


   Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model.  The RTCP Feedback
   Suppression report extension specified in the section 4 of this
   document will work in both Feedback models.  Details of operation in
   each are specified below.

6.1.1.  Simple Feedback Model

   In the simple Feedback Model, the Loss detection instance(s)are
   distributed into two different distribution sources. e.g., upstream
   distribution source with loss detection support may act as the loss
   detector of downstream distribution source while The downstream
   distribution source doesn't have loss detection support.

   The upstream distribution source MUST listen on the corresponding RTP
   session for data.  When the upstream distribution source observes
   that a sequence of RTP packets from a media source contains gaps (by
   checking the sequence number of packets), the upstream distribution
   source MUST use the same packet types as traditional RTCP feedback
   described in [RFC3550] and create one new RTCP Feedback Report with
   information on the RTP sequence number of the lost packets and
   suppression early indication event.  When the upstream distribution
   source is eligible to transmit, it MUST send this Report packet to
   the upstream distribution source.

   The downstream Distribution Source MUST listen for RTCP data sent to
   the RTCP port.  Upon receiving the RTCP Feedback Report packet from
   the upstream distribution source, the downstream Distribution Source
   MUST forward it to the group on the multicast RTCP session.  Every
   RTCP packet from each upstream distribution source MUST be reflected
   individually.

   This RTCP Feedback Report lets the receivers know that feedback for
   this packet loss is not needed and SHOULD NOT be sent to the media
   source(s).  If the media source(s) are part of the SSM group for RTCP
   packet reflection, the Distribution Source MUST filter this packet
   out.  If the media source(s) are not part of the SSM group for RTCP
   packets, the Distribution Source MUST not forward this RTCP packets
   received from the receivers to the media source(s).

   When the receiver receives the RTCP packet, if the receiver
   understands the message it will not send feedback (e.g., NACK) for
   the missing packets reported in the message and will accept a
   retransmission packet (if forthcoming) transmitted from the
   Distribution Source.  If it did not understand the Feedback
   Suppression report the receiver MAY of course still send feedback
   messages to the specified media source.  When the distribution source
   receives a feedback message reporting loss from one or more receivers
   after it has already detected packet loss via loss detection

   functionality, the distribution source MUST filter them out until
   proactive recovery is complete.

6.1.2.  Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model

   In the distribution source feedback summary model, there may have
   multiple distribution sources and the Loss Detection instances are
   distributed into different distribution sources.  In some cases,
   these Loss Detection instances for the same session can exist at the
   same time, e.g., one Loss Detection instance is implemented in the
   upstream distribution source A, another two Loss Detection instances
   for the same session is part of feedback target A and feedback target
   B respectively within the distribution source B. In this section, we
   focus on this generic case to discuss the distribution Source
   Feedback Summary Model.

   The distribution source A MUST listen on the RTP channel for data.
   When the distribution source A observes RTP packets from a media
   source are not consecutive by checking the sequence number of
   packets, the distribution source A generates the new RTCP Feedback
   Suppression Report packet described in the section 6, and then send
   it to the distribution source B.

   Two loss detection instances within the Distribution Source B MUST
   listen for RTCP data sent to the RTCP port.  Upon receiving the RTCP
   Feedback Report packet from the Distribution Source A, the
   distribution source B needs to summarize the information received
   from all the RTCP Feedback Reports generated by the upstream
   distribution source together with the information generated by two
   loss detection instances witin the Distribution Source B and then
   create the summary report to include all these information.  In order
   to reduce the processing load at the distribution source, each loss
   detection instance MAY provide preliminary summarization report.

   During the summary report creating, the Distribution Source B MUST
   use its own SSRC value for transmitting summarization information and
   MUST perform proper SSRC collision detection and resolution.

   In some case, the distribution source B MAY receive RTCP NACK
   messages from the receivers behind the Distribution Source before the
   distribution source detects the packet loss which may cause potential
   Feedback implosion.  In such case, the distribution source MAY filter
   them out if it already sent a packet loss request for the missing
   packet to the media source.  When the distribution source confirms
   packet loss reported by the receiver, the distribution source
   generates the summary report to include the packet loss information
   from the corresponding receiver or upstream distribution source.

Internet-Draft            Feedback Suppression              October 2010


   The distribution source MAY send this new RTCP summary report
   described in the section 6 to the group on the multicast RTCP channel
   and in the meanwhile sending a packet loss request to the media
   source.

   If there are a couple of distribution sources with loss detection
   support looking at the same RTP stream, then the loss may be
   identified by all and they will all send requests for the same packet
   loss.  In this case, the distribution source MUST filter out the
   duplicated information from various distribution source and only
   append one copy of such information to the summary report.

   When the host receives the RTCP packet, if the host understands this
   message it will not send packet loss request (e.g., NACK) for the
   missing packets reported in the message.  If it did not understand
   this new message, the host MAY send packet loss request(e.g., NACK
   messages) to the specified media source.  When the distribution
   source receives the packet loss request from the hosts after it has
   already detected packet loss, the distribution source MUST filter it
   out until proactive recovery is complete.

6.2.  Unicast based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast Stream (RAMS) use
      case

   In the typical RAMS architecture, there may have one distribution
   source placed between media source and BRS for relaying SSM stream
   from media source.  The BRS will receive the SSM stream from the DS.
   Suppose there are several BRSes behind the distribution source or
   media source, there may be just one BRS that detects packet loss on
   its upstream link between the distribution source and BRS, but the
   others will perhaps not, as the packet loss took place on SSM tree
   branch that does not impact the other BRSes.  In such case, the
   distribution source with loss detection functionality support can not
   detect packet loss at the downstream of itself, therefore the
   distribution source SHOULD NOT create new Feedback Suppression
   message and send it to all the BRS.  If BRS impacted by packet loss
   has loss detection support, the BRS MAY choose to create new Feedback
   Suppression message and send it to the receivers behind this BRS.

6.3.  RTP transport translator use case

   A Transport Translator (Topo-Trn-Translator), as defined in [RFC5117]
   is typically forwarding the RTP and RTCP traffic between RTP clients,
   for example converting between multicast and unicast for domains that
   do not support multicast.  The translator can identify packet loss
   from the upstream and send the Feedback Suppression message to the
   unicast receivers.  The translator can also serve as a loss reporter
   on the multicast side as described in the SSM case.

Internet-Draft            Feedback Suppression              October 2010


6.4.  Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) use case

   In point to multipoint topologies using video switching MCU (Topo-
   Video-switch-MCU) [RFC5117], the MCU typically forwards a single
   media stream to each participant, selected from the available input
   streams.  The selection of the input stream is often based on voice
   activity in the audio-visual conference, but other conference
   management mechanisms (like presentation mode or explicit floor
   control) exist as well.

   In this case the MCU MAY detect packet loss from the sender or may
   decide to switch to a new source.  In both cases the receiver MAY
   lose synchronization with the video stream and MAY send a FIR
   request.  If the MCU itself can detect the mis-synchronization of the
   video, the MCU can send the FIR suppression message to the receivers
   and send a FIR request to the video source.


7.  Security Considerations

   The defined messages have certain properties that have security
   implications.  These must be addressed and taken into account by
   users of this protocol.

   Spoofed or maliciously created feedback messages of the type defined
   in this specification can have the following implications:

   Sending NACK Suppression Report with wrong sequence number of lost
   packet that makes missing RTP packets can not be compensated.

   Sending FIR Suppression Report with wrong sequence number of lost
   packet that makes missing RTP packets can not be compensated by
   update request mechanism.

   To prevent these attacks, there is a need to apply authentication and
   integrity protection of the feedback messages.  This can be
   accomplished against threats external to the current RTP session
   using the RTP profile that combines Secure RTP [RFC3711] and AVPF
   into SAVPF [RFC5124].

   Note that middleboxes that are not visible at the RTP layer that wish
   to send NACK/FIR suppression reports on behalf of the media source
   can only do so if they spoof the SSRC of the media source.  This is
   difficult in case SRTP is in use.  If the middlebox is visible at the
   RTP layer, this is not an issue, provided the middlebox is part of
   the security context for the session.

   Also note that endpoints that receive a NACK/FIR suppression request



Wu, et al.               Expires April 23, 2011                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft            Feedback Suppression              October 2010


   would be well-advised to ignore it, unless it is authenticated via
   SRTCP or similar.  Accepting un-authenticated NACK/ FIR suppression
   requests can lead to a denial of service attack, where the endpoint
   accepts poor quality media that could be repaired.


8.  IANA Consideration

   New feedback type and New parameters for RTCP FSS receiver feedback
   report are subject to IANA registration.  For general guidelines on
   IANA considerations for RTCP feedback, refer to [RFC4585].

   feedback report registry to "Feedback Storm Suppression" with the
   following registrations format:

                  Name:            FSS
                  Long Name:       Feedback Storm Suppression
                  Value:           TBD
                  Reference:       This document.

   This document also assigns the parameter value y in the RTCP FSS
   feedback report Registry to "NACK Suppression Early Indication ",
   with the following registrations format:

                Name:           NSEI
                Long name:      NACK Suppression Early Indication
                Value:          TBD
                Reference:      this document.

   This document also assigns the parameter value z in the RTCP FSS
   feedback report Registry to "FIR Suppression Early Indication ", with
   the following registrations format:

                Name:           FSEI
                Long name:      FIR Suppression Early Indication
                Value:          TBD

Appendix A.  Example scenarios for NACK Implosion

   In SSM RTP sessions as described in [RFC5760], there may have more
   than one distribution source between the media source and the
   receivers.  In order for loss repair, the distribution source may
   choose to include the support for retransmission as part of the
   offered SDP and will expect such support from the media source.The
   following section outline several example scenarios for NACK
   Implosion.

A.1.  Scenario 1: One or more media source, One distribution source

   The scenario 1 is displayed below in Figure 3.  In this scenario, one
   or more Media Sources send RTP packets to the RTP Receivers through
   the same Distribution Source.  The Distribution Source relays the RTP
   packets to the receivers using a source-specific multicast channel.
   In the reverse direction, the receivers transmit RTCP packets via
   unicast to the distribution source.  The Distribution Source in turn
   relays RTCP packets to the media souce and then transmits the RTCP
   packets back to the receivers, using source-specific multicast.

   The scenario 2 is displayed below in Figure 4.  In this scenario, One
   media source passes through two distribution source in cascading and
   sends RTP packets to all the RTP receivers.  In this case, the
   distribution source 2 is located in the downstream direction of
   distribution source 1.

   The scenario 3 is displayed below in Figure 5.  In this scenario, the
   Media Sources send RTP packets to all the RTP receivers through two
   different path respectively.  In each path, there is a distribution
   source.  The distribution source1 is a neighboring node of
   distribution source 2.

Appendix B.  Applicability of Feedback Suppression

   This document defines new RTCP feedback Report, which we refer to as
   Feedback Suppression to deal with NACK Implosion mentioned above.
   Here we give two examples to show how this new RTCP feedback report
   is applied into three scenarios described in Appendix A.

   Applicability of Feedback Suppression in Scenario 1 described in
   Figure 3 is shown in the Figure 6.  In this figure, the distribution
   source detect the packet loss before the receiver perceive it and ask
   for retransmission of the lost packets from the media source on
   behalf of all the RTP receivers. , in the meanwhile, the distribution
   source transmits the RTCP Feedback Suppression Indication back to the
   receivers using source-specific multicast channel.  Upon receiving
   the lost packet via the RTP retransmission payload format, the
   distribution source forwards the retransmitted packet to all the
   receivers.  The receiver will accept a retransmission stream
   transmitted from the Distrbituion Source.

   When the distribution source receives a feedback message reporting
   loss from one or more receivers after it has already detected packet
   loss, the distribution source MUST filter them out until the
   Retransmission stream is ready in the Distrbitution Source.  In this
   way, the delay for the receiver to recover from the packet loss can
   be reduced and the risk of increasing network congestion can be
   mitigated.

       Figure 6: Applicability of NACK Suppression Early Indication

   Applicability of Feedback Suppression in Scenario 2 or 3 described in
   Figure 4 and Figure 5 is shown in the Figure 7.  The procedure in the
   Figure 7 is similar to the one in the figure Figure 6.  The only
   difference is distribution source should not only notify all the
   receiver behind itself not to send NACK but also propagate the
   retransmission suppression indication to the neighboring distribution
   sources.  In this way, all the receivers behind all the neighboring
   distribution source can avoid sending massive retransmission request
   to the media source.
