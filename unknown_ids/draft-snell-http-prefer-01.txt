Internet-Draft                 HTTP Prefer                 December 2007


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a new HTTP header that can be used by a
   client to request that certain behaviors be implemented by a server
   while processing a request.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  The Prefer Request Header

   The Prefer request-header is used to indicate that particular server
   behaviors are preferred, but not required, by the client.  Prefer is
   similar in nature to the Expect header defined by [RFC2616] with the
   exception that servers are allowed to ignore a clients stated
   preferences.

     Prefer       =  "Prefer" ":" 1#preference

     preference   =  "return-no-content" | preference-extension
     preference-extension =  token [ "=" ( token | quoted-string )
                             *prefer-params ]
     prefer-params =  ";" token [ "=" ( token | quoted-string ) ]

   This header is defined with an extensible syntax to allow for future
   extensions.  A server that does not understand or is unable to comply
   with any of the preference values in the Prefer field of a request
   MUST ignore those values and MUST NOT stop processing or signal an
   error.

   Comparison of preference values is case-insensitive for unquoted
   tokens and is case-sensitive for quoted-string preference-extensions.

   The Prefer mechanism is hop-by-hop: that is, an HTTP proxy MAY choose
   to honor a preference even if the origin server does not.  However,
   the Prefer request-header itself is end-to-end; it MUST be forwarded
   if the request is forwarded.


3.  The "return-no-content" Preference

   The "return-no-content" token indicates that the client prefers that
   the server not include an entity in the response to a successful
   request.  Typically, such responses would use the 204 No Content
   status code as defined in Section 10.2.5 of [RFC2616], but other
   status codes can be used as appropriate.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The 'Prefer' request header should be added to the permanent registry
   (see [RFC3864]).


       Header field name: Prefer

       Applicable Protocol: HTTP

       Status: standard

       Author/Change controller: IETF

       Specification document: this specification


5.  Security Considerations

   Specific preferences requested by a client can introduce security
   considerations and concerns beyond those discussed in [RFC2616].
   Implementors must refer to the specifications and descriptions of
   those preferences to determine the security considerations relevant
   to each.
