Internet-Draft              CLUE Definitions                    May 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document collects terminology and definitions to be used
   consistently among documents produced in the CLUE working group.  The
   draft is intended to be a living document, to be updated as the
   working group discussions progress.  It is not intended for
   publication as an RFC; instead, it is expected that definitions and
   terminology defined herein are going to be replicated in other CLUE
   documents.

   All defined terms herein are captitalized.  It is recommended that
   authors of other CLUE document follow this conventions when using
   definitions from this document.

   It should be understood that the definitions herein are not to be
   interpreted as antedating design decisions to be made later.  It's
   entierly reasonable that design choices conflicting with definitions
   in this draft may become necessary.  In such cases, CLUE document
   authors can either request the definition be updated, or can simply
   avoid the use of a definition of this document.  However, an author
   should never use a capitzalied definition as set forth herein with a
   different meaning in a different CLUE document.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions

        Audio Mixing: refers to the accumulation of scaled audio signals
        to produce a single audio stream.  See RTP Topologies,
        [RFC5117].

        Capture Device: A device that converts audio and video input
        into an electrical signal, in most cases to be fed into a media
        encoder.  Cameras and microphones are examples for capture
        devices.

        Conference: used as defined in [RFC4353], A Framework for
        Conferencing within the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

Internet-Draft              CLUE Definitions                    May 2011


        Endpoint: The logical point of final termination through
        receiving, decoding and rendering, and/or initiation through
        capturing, encoding, and sending of media streams.  An endpoint
        consists of one or more physical devices which source and sink
        media streams, and exactly one [RFC4353] Participant (which, in
        turn, includes exactly one SIP User Agent).  In contrast to an
        endpoint, an MCU may also send and receive media streams, but it
        is not the initiator nor the final terminator in the sense that
        Media is Captured or Rendered.  Endpoints can be anything from
        multiscreen/multicamera rooms to handheld devices.

        Endpoint Characteristics: include placement of Capture and
        Rendering Devices, capture/render angle, resolution of cameras
        and screens, spatial location and mixing parameters of
        microphones.  Endpoint characteristics are not specific to
        individual media streams sent by the endpoint.

        Layout: How rendered media streams are spatially arranged with
        respect to each other on a single screen/mono audio telepresence
        endpoint, and how rendered media streams are arranged with
        respect to each other on a multiple screen/speaker telepresence
        endpoint.  Note that audio as well as video is encompassed by
        the term layout--in other words, included is the placement of
        audio streams on speakers as well as video streams on video
        screens.  Edit. note: this is on the RENDERER side.

        Left: to be interpreted as a stage direction, see also
        [StageDirection(Wikipadia)]

        Local: Sender and/or receiver physically co-located ("local") in
        the context of the discussion.

        MCU: Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) - a device that connects two
        or more endpoints together into one single multimedia conference
        [RFC5117].  An MCU includes an [RFC4353] Mixer.  Edt. Note:
        RFC4353 is tardy in requireing that media from the mixer be sent
        to EACH participant.  I think we have practical use cases where
        this is not the case.  But the bug (if it is one) is in 4353 and
        not herein.

        Media: Any data that, after suitable encoding, can be conveyed
        over RTP, including audio, video or timed text.  Edt. note: does
        Media include far end camera control (which can be conveyed over
        RTP)?

        Model: a set of assumptions a telepresence system of a given
        vendor adheres to and expects the remote telepresence system(s)
        also to adhere to.

        Remote: Sender and/or receiver on the other side of the
        communication channel (depending on context); not Local.  A
        remote can be an Endpoint or an MCU.

        Render: the process of generating a representation from a media,
        such as displayed motion video or sound emitted from
        loudspeakers.

        Rendering Device: A device that converts an electrical signal -
        in most cases stemming from a media decoder - to audible and
        optical signals.  Screens and loudspeakers are examples for
        rendering devices.

        Right: to be interpreted as stage direction, see also
        [StageDirection(Wikipadia)]

        Source selection policies: rules for determining which media
        source(s) to play or show.

        Spatial Relation: The arrangement in space of two objects, in
        contrast to relation in time or other relationships.  See also
        Left and Right.

        Stream Characteristics: include media stream attributes commonly
        used in non-CLUE SIP/SDP environments (such as: media codec, bit
        rate, resolution, profile/level etc.) as well as CLUE specific
        attributes (which could include for example and depending on the
        solution found: the I-D or spatial location of a capture device
        a stream originates from).

        Telepresence: an environment that gives non co-located users or
        user groups a feeling of (co-located) presence - the feeling
        that a Local user is in the same room with other Local users and
        the Remote parties.  The inclusion of Remote parties is achieved
        through multimedia communication including at least audio and
        video signals of high fidelity.

        Video composite: A single image that is formed from combining
        visual elements from separate sources.

   Removed "session".  Editors are advised to be specific about SIP,
   RTP, or whatever else sessions.

   Made clear that Layout refers to rendering, not capturing.
