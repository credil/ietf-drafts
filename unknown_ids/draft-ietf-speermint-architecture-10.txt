1.  Introduction

   The objective of this document is to define a reference peering
   architecture in the context of session peering for multimedia
   interconnects.  In this process, we define the peering reference
   architecture, its functional components, and peering interface
   functions from the perspective of a SIP Service provider's (SSP)
   [RFC5486] network.

   This architecture allows the interconnection of two SSPs in layer 5
   peering as defined in the SIP-based session peering requirements
   [I-D.ietf-speermint-requirements].

   Layer 3 peering is outside the scope of this document.  Hence, the
   figures in this document focus on Layer 5 protocol functions and
   elements.

   This document uses terminology defined in the Session Peering for
   Multimedia Interconnect Terminology document [RFC5486].

3.  Procedures of Inter-domain SSP Session Establishment

   This document assumes that in order for a session to be established
   from a User Agent (UA) in the Originating SSP's network to a UA in
   the Target SSP's network the following steps are taken:

   1.  Determine the target SSP via the LUF.  (Note: If the target
       address represents a resource within the originating SSP, the
       behavior is out-of-scope with respect to this draft.)





Uzelac, et al.         Expires September 10, 2010               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       SPEERMINT Peering Architecture           March 2010


   2.  Determine the address of the SF of the target SSP via the LRF.

   3.  Establish the session

   4.  Exchange the media, which could include voice, video, text, etc.

   5.  End the session

   The originating SSP would likely perform steps 1-4, and the target
   SSP would likely perform steps 4-5.

   If the target SSP is also an indirect peer, then steps 1-4 may be
   repeated.  This is reflected in Figure 1 that shows the target SSP
   with its own peering functions.


4.  Relationships between functions/elements

   o  An SBE can contain a SF function.

   o  An SF can perform LUF and LRF functions.

   o  As an additional consideration, in current Session Border
      Controller (SBC) implementations, an SBC can contain an SF, SBE
      and DBE, and may perform the LUF and LRF functions.

   o  The following functions can communicate as follows, depending upon
      various real-world implementations:

      *  SF can communicate with LUF, LRF and another SF

      *  LUF can communicate with SF

      *  LRF can communicate with SF


5.  Recommended SSP Procedures

   This section describes the functions in more detail and provides some
   recommendations on the role they would play in an example SIP
   telephony call scenario.

   Some of the information in the section is taken from
   [I-D.ietf-speermint-requirements] and is put here for continuity
   purposes.

5.1.  Originating SSP Procedures

5.1.1.  The Look-Up Function (LUF)

   Purpose is to determine the SF of the target domain of a given
   request and optionally develop Session Establishment Data.

5.1.1.1.  Target Address Analysis

   When the originating SSP receives a SIP request, it analyzes the
   target URI to determine whether the call needs to be routed internal
   or external to its network.

   If the target address does not represent a resource inside the
   originating SSP's administrative domain, then the originating SSP
   performs a Lookup (LUF) to determine the target domain, and then it
   resolves the call routing data by using Location Routing (LRF).

   For example, if the request to communicate is for an im: or pres: URI
   type, the originating SSP follows the procedures in [RFC3861].  If
   the highest priority supported URI scheme is sip: or sips: the
   originating SSP skips to SIP DNS resolution.  Likewise, if the target
   address is already a sip: or sips: URI in an external domain, the
   originating SSP skips to SIP DNS resolution in Section 5.1.2.1

   If the target address corresponds to a specific E.164 address, the
   SSP may need to perform some form of number plan mapping according to
   local policy.  For example, in the United States, a dial string
   beginning "011 44" could be converted to "+44", or in the United
   Kingdom "00 1" could be converted to "+1".  Once the SSP has an E.164
   address, it can use ENUM.

5.1.1.2.  ENUM Lookup

   If an external E.164 address is the target, the originating SSP
   consults a private or public ENUM server, according to the procedures
   described in [RFC3761].  The SSP must query for the "E2U+sip"
   enumservice as described in [RFC3764], but MAY check for other
   enumservices.  The originating SSP MAY consult a cache or alternate
   representation of the ENUM data rather than actual DNS queries.
   Also, the SSP may skip actual DNS queries if the target domain is
   represented as an IPv4/v6 address.

   If an im: or pres: URI is chosen for based on an "E2U+im" [RFC3861]
   or "E2U+pres" [RFC3953] enumserver, the SSP follows the procedures
   for resolving these URIs to URIs for specific protocols such a SIP or
   XMPP.

Internet-Draft       SPEERMINT Peering Architecture           March 2010


5.1.2.  Location Routing Function (LRF)

   The LRF of an Originating SSP analyzes the target address and target
   domain identified by the LUF, and discovers the next hop signaling
   function (SF) in a peering relationship.  The resource to determine
   the SF of the target domain might be provided by a third-party as in
   the indirect peering case.  The following sections define mechanisms
   which may be used by the LRF.  These are not in any particular order
   and, importantly, not all of them may be used.

5.1.2.1.  DNS resolution

   The originating SSP uses the procedures in [RFC3263] to determine how
   to contact the target SSP.  To summarize the RFC 3263 procedure:
   unless these are explicitly encoded in the target URI, a transport is
   chosen using Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) records, a port is
   chosen using SRV records, and an address is chosen using A or AAAA
   records.

   When communicating with another SSP, entities compliant to this
   document should select a TLS-protected transport for communication
   from the Originating SSP to the target SSP if available.

5.1.2.2.  Routing Table

   If there are no End User ENUM records and the Originating SSP cannot
   discover the carrier-of-record or if the Originating SSP cannot reach
   the carrier-of-record via SIP peering, the Originating SSP may
   deliver the call to the PSTN or reject it.  Note that the originating
   SSP may forward the call to another SSP for PSTN gateway termination
   by prior arrangement using the routing table.

   If so, the originating SSP rewrites the Request-URI to address the
   gateway resource in the target SSP's domain and MAY forward the
   request on to that SSP using the procedures described in the
   remainder of these steps.

5.1.2.3.  LRF to LRF Routing

   Communication between the LRF of two interconnecting SSPs may use DNS
   or statically provisioned IP Addresses for reachability.  Other
   inputs to determine the path may be code-based routing, method-based
   routing, Time of day, least cost and/or source-based routing.

5.1.3.  Signaling Path Border Element (SBE)

   The purpose of signaling path border element is to perform routing of
   SIP messages as well as optionally implement security and policies on



Uzelac, et al.         Expires September 10, 2010               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       SPEERMINT Peering Architecture           March 2010


   SIP messages, and to assist in discovery/exchange of parameters to be
   used by the Media Function (MF).

   The signaling function performs the routing of SIP messages.  The
   optional termination and re-initiation of calls may be performed by
   the signaling path Session Border Element (SBE), or other signaling
   elements.

   Optionally, the SF of a SBE may perform additional functions such as
   Session Admission Control, SIP Denial of Service protection, SIP
   Topology Hiding, SIP header normalization, SIP security, privacy, and
   encryption.

   The SF of a SBE can also process SDP payloads for media information
   such as media type, bandwidth, and type of codec; then, communicate
   this information to the media function.  Signaling function may
   optionally communicate with the network to pass Layer 3 related
   policies.

5.1.4.  Establishing a Trusted Relationship

   Depending on the security needs and trust relationships between SSPs,
   different security mechanism can be used to establish SIP calls.
   These are discussed in the following subsections.

5.1.4.1.  IPSec

   In certain deployments the use of IPSec between the signaling
   functions of the originating and terminating domains can be used as a
   security mechanism instead of TLS.

5.1.4.2.  Co-Location

   In this scenario the SFs are co-located in a physically secure
   location and/or are members of a segregated network.  In this case
   messages between the originating and terminating SSPs would be sent
   as clear text.

5.1.4.3.  Sending the SIP Request

   Once a trust relationship between the peers is established, the
   originating SSP sends the request.

5.2.  Target SSP Procedures

Internet-Draft       SPEERMINT Peering Architecture           March 2010


5.2.1.  The Ingress SBE

5.2.1.1.  TLS

   When the target SSP receives a TLS client hello, it responds with its
   certificate.  The Originating SSP certificate should be valid and
   rooted in a well-known certificate authority.  The procedures to
   authenticate the SSP's originating domain are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-sip-domain-certs].

   The SF of the Target SSP verifies that the Identity header is valid,
   corresponds to the message, corresponds to the Identity-Info header,
   and that the domain in the From header corresponds to one of the
   domains in the TLS client certificate.

5.2.1.2.  Receive SIP Requests

   Once a trust relationship is established, the Target SSP is prepared
   to receive incoming SIP requests.  For new requests (dialog forming
   or not) the receiving SSP verifies if the target (request-URI) is a
   domain for which it is responsible.  For these requests, there should
   be no remaining Route header field values.  For in-dialog requests,
   the receiving SSP can verify that it corresponds to the top-most
   Route header field value.

   The receiving SSP may reject incoming requests due to local policy.
   When a request is rejected because the originating SSP is not
   authorized to peer, the receiving SSP should respond with a 403
   response with the reason phrase "Unsupported Peer".

5.3.  Data Path Border Element (DBE)

   The purpose of the DBE [RFC5486] is to perform media related
   functions such as media transcoding and media security implementation
   between two SSPs.

   An Example of this is to transform a voice payload from one codec
   (e.g., G.711) to another (e.g., Enhanced Variable Rate Codec (EvRC)).
   Additionally, the MF may perform media relaying, media security,
   privacy, and encryption.

8.  Security Considerations

   In all cases, cryptographic-based security should be maintained as an
   optional requirement between peering providers conditioned on the
   presence or absence of underlying physical security of SSP
   connections, e.g. within the same secure physical building.

   In order to maintain a consistent approach, unique and specialized
   security requirements common for the majority of peering
   relationships, should be standardized within the IETF.  These
   standardized methods may enable capabilities such as dynamic peering
   relationships across publicly maintained interconnections.
