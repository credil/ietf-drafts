1.  Introduction

1.1.  Delay Report Block

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.  The new block type
   supports the reporting of the mean, minimum and maximum values of the
   network round-trip delay between RTP interfaces in peer RTP end
   systems as measured, for example, using the RTCP method described in
   [RFC3550].  It also supports reporting of the component of the round-
   trip delay internal to the local RTP system.

   The network metrics belong to the class of packet transport delay
   metrics defined in [MONARCH] (work in progress).

   Instances of this Metrics Block refer by tag to the separate
   auxiliary Measurement Identity block [MEASIDENT] which contains
   information such as the SSRC of the measured stream, and RTP sequence
   numbers and time intervals indicating the span of the report.

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This draft defines a new Extended Report block that
   MUST be used as defined in [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [PMOLFRAME] provides guidance on
   the definition and specification of performance metrics.  Metrics
   described in this draft either reference external definitions or
   define metrics generally in accordance with the guidelines in
   [PMOLFRAME].

1.4.  Applicability

   This metric is believed to be applicable to all RTP applications.

2.  Definitions

   Numeric formats

      This report block makes use of binary fractions.  The terminology
      used is

      S X:Y

      where S indicates a two's complement signed representation, X the
      number of bits prior to the decimal place and Y the number of bits
      after the decimal place.

      Hence 8:8 represents an unsigned number in the range 0.0 to
      255.996 with a granularity of 0.0039.  S7:8 would represent the
      range -128.000 to +127.996. 0:16 represents a proper binary
      fraction with range

      0.0 to 1 - 1/65536 = 0.9999847

      though note that use of flag values at the top of the numeric
      range slightly reduces this upper limit.  For example, if the 16-
      bit values 0xfffe and 0xffff are used as flags for "over-range"
      and "unavailable" conditions, a 0:16 quantity has range

      0.0 to 1 - 3/65536 = 0.9999542

3.2.  Definition of Fields in Delay Metrics Report Block

   block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Delay Report Block is identified by the constant NDEL.

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NDEL with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Delay metric block is
      an Interval or a Cumulative metric block, that is, whether the
      reported values apply to the most recent measurement interval
      duration between successive metrics reports (I=1) (the Interval
      Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=0) (the Cumulative Duration).
      Numerical values for both these intervals are provided in the
      Measurement Identifier block referenced by the tag field below.

   Measurement Identifier association (tag): 3 bits

      This field is used to identify the Measurement Identifier block
      [MEASIDENT] which describes this measurement.  The relevant
      Measurement Identifier block has the same tag value as the Delay
      block.  Note that there may be more than one Measurement
      Identifier block per RTCP packet.

   Reserved (resv): 4 bits

Internet-Draft                RTCP XR Delay                February 2009


      These bits are reserved.  They SHOULD be set to zero by senders
      and MUST be ignored by receivers.

   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Delay block, the block length is equal to 2.

   Mean Network Round Trip Delay (ms): 16 bits

      The Mean Network Round Trip Delay is the mean value of the RTP-to-
      RTP interface round trip delay in ms over the measurement period,
      typically determined using RTCP SR/RR.

      If only one measurement of Round Trip Delay is available for the
      timespan of the report (whether Interval or Cumulative), this
      single value should be reported as the mean value.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.

   End System Delay (ms): 16 bits

      The End System Delay is the internal round trip delay within the
      reporting endpoint, calculated using the nominal value of the
      jitter buffer delay plus the accumulation/ encoding and decoding /
      playout delay associated with the codec being used.

      If the measured or estimated value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value
      0xFFFE SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.
      If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be
      reported.

   Min Network Round Trip Delay (ms): 16 bits

      The Min Network Round Trip Delay is the minimum value of the RTP-
      to-RTP interface round trip delay in ms over the measurement
      period, typically determined using RTCP SR/RR.

      If only one measurement of Round Trip Delay is available for the
      timespan of the report (whether Interval or Cumulative), this
      single value should be reported as the minimum value.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.

   Max Network Round Trip Delay (ms): 16 bits

      The Max Network Round Trip Delay is the maximum value of the RTP-
      to-RTP interface round trip delay in ms over the measurement
      period, typically determined using RTCP SR/RR.

      If only one measurement of Round Trip Delay is available for the
      timespan of the report (whether Interval or Cumulative), this
      single value should be reported as the maximum value.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.

4.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

   (defined in [RFC3611])

   xr-format = xr-format / xr-delay-block

   xr-delay-block = "delay"

5.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

5.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value NDEL in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the "Delay Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NDEL with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

5.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "delay" in the "RTCP XR
   SDP Parameters Registry".

5.3.  Contact information for registrations

   The contact information for the registrations is:

6.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
