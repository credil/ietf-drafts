      <t>This document establishes a set of extended SMTP policy codes for
	anti-spam. It seeks to provide additional codes for error texts that
	currently use the extended SMTP error code 5.7.1. The anti-spam codes
	were determined by looking at error texts produced by major ISPs and
	finding commonalities. The result is a new set of error texts with
	associated extended SMTP error codes.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This RFC defines a set of Enhanced Status Codes <xref target="RFC3463"/>
	for SMTP related to anti-spam policy.  These codes are to be
	registered with the IANA Mail Enhanced Status Codes registry as
	defined in <xref target="RFC5248"/>.  While Anti-Spam policy is inherently
	a local decision, assigning these codes helps troubleshoot problems and
	lower support costs by allowing sending administrators to resolve many
	problems themselves.</t>
      <t>This document is being discussed on the SMTP mailing list, ietf-smtp@imc.org.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="anti-spam-subject" toc="include" title="Introducing the Anti-Spam Subject">
      <t>The most common extended SMTP code assigned to anti-spam policy is
   5.7.1.  This is because the subject code of 7 is meant for security
   or policy.  For anti-spam policy, the only logical detail code is 1,
   "Delivery not authorized, message refused".  Using 5.7.1 for many
   different anti-spam policies weakens the usefulness of extended SMTP
   error codes.  One of the motivations behind <xref target="RFC3463"/> was to
   re-distribute the classifications of SMTP error codes in order to
   provide a richer set of errors, and provide a means for
   machine-readable, human language independent status codes.  Thus a
   new subject code of 8 is introduced for anti-spam policy.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="method" toc="include" title="Methodology of determining new detail codes">
      <t>All of the new detail text was gathered by surveying several existing
   large ISPs to see what messages were produce when presented with
   messages that violate their policies.  An attempt was then made to
   coalesce the messages together into common themes.  These themes
   where then simply assigned a detail number.</t>
      <t>While this document provides suggested text for each detail code,
   alternate text can be provided if the text is in the spirit of the
   suggested text.  This will allow sites to simply prepend the proper
   extended SMTP code to their existing text.  Sites that are starting
   to implement anti-spam policy SHOULD use the text provided in this
   document.</t>
      <t>While this document strives to document common anti-spam policies, it
   is by nature incomplete.  <xref target="RFC3463"/> notes that new subject and detail
   codes will be added over time.  This document is no exception to that
   and can be extended at future dates.</t>
    </section>
    <section toc="include" anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is directed to add the following values to the registry of Mail
   Enhanced Status Codes specified in <xref target="RFC5248"/>.</t>
      <t>The Mail Enhanced Status Codes registry will be modified to add a new
   subject sub-code having the value 8.  This sub-code will be dedicated
   to anti-spam policy related SMTP errors.</t>

      <t>As stated in <xref target="RFC3463"/>, use of enhanced status codes may disclose
	   additional information about how an internal mail system is
	   implemented beyond that available through the SMTP status codes.</t>
      <t>Some of the proposed additions to the response code list are security
	   related.  Having these registered in one place to prevent collisions
	   will improve their value.  Security error responses can leak
	   information to active attackers (e.g., the distinction between "user
	   not found" and "bad password" during authentication).  Documents
	   defining security error codes should make it clear when this is the
	   case, so that SMTP server software subject to such threats can
	   provide appropriate controls to restrict exposure.</t>
