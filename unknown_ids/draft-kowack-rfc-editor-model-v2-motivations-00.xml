      <t>This memo provides the background and motivations for the
      recommendations made in draft-kowack-rfc-editor-model-v2-overview-00. It
      represents the perspectives resulting from an individual managerial and
      analytical effort of nearly one year's duration. It contains a summary
      of the factors considered to be essential to the job of RFC Series
      Editor (RSE). This includes a summary of the work done as part of the
      RFC Editor, the differences between <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>and
      the <xref target="I-D.v2-overview"></xref> recommendations, a discussion
      of development work that should be done, and an assessment of the time
      needed to perform the RSE job. &#160;There is also a section listing and
      responding to questions surrounding the recommendations.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>As Transitional RFC Series Editor (TRSE), I performed the job of RFC
      Series Editor (RSE or &#8220;Series Editor&#8221;) throughout 2010.
      While actively engaged in the role, I was to analyze work requirements,
      engage in community discussion, and recommend changes as necessary to
      <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>. (Note to the reader: I use 'community'
      to refer to anyone who participates in, or uses the output of, the
      technical, organizational, and other discussions associated with the I*
      entities.) A specific problem was also to be addressed: the defined RSE
      position must attract qualified candidates. Those recommendations are
      summarized in <xref target="I-D.v2-overview"></xref>. This memo provides
      the background and motivations for the recommendations. It pays
      particular attention to the role of the Series Editor and how <xref
      target="I-D.v2-overview"></xref> differs from <xref
      target="RFC5620"></xref>. This document is not a community document.
      Rather, it contains the perspectives resulting from an individual
      managerial and analytical effort of nearly one year's duration.</t>

      <t><list>
          <t>If the community wants an RFC Editor that is responsive and
          productive, then the IAB must appoint an RFC Series Editor who has
          management and development skills and who is given authority across
          the entire Editor."&gt; I observe that a segment of the community
          wishes to minimize the role of the Series Editor, envisioning the
          job as merely a senior editor. My experience this year demonstrates
          that this will limit the ability of the RFC Editor to deal with its
          backlog of development requirements and its ability to adapt to
          emerging community issues. The scale, complexity, and richness of
          the subject matter of the Editor create regular demands for
          management and coordination.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Key Observations and Drivers of Design Choices">
      <t>The key observations behind, and drivers of the design for <xref
      target="I-D.v2-overview"></xref> are:<list>
          <t>The RFC Editor must work, and be structured to work, in the
          community's interest.<list>
              <t>The RFC Editor (or 'Editor') must not allow anyone to have
              inappropriate influence over, or 'capture' the Editor - using it
              in his own interests. This includes the Series Editor, staff,
              contractors, unauthorized I* entities, individuals, or groups.
              For all substantive issues, the community must clearly be in
              charge.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Issues addressed by the Series Editor consistently demand a high
          degree of publications-related knowledge and analytical skills not
          common in our community.<list>
              <t>Because RFCs do not change once they are published,
              prospective innovations must be thought out in advance very
              carefully and with special attention to unexpected consequences,
              putting a premium on expertise and prior experience. During
              2010, I did not see issues that were rudimentary or only
              required text editorial skills. Rather, each issue required
              deliberate review and analysis to uncover its character and
              extent, often including RFC Editor staff, RSAG members, and
              community members. These required sophisticated management and
              service design skills, not merely editing skills.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>There is a substantial body of important RFC Editor and Series
          development work waiting to be done.<list>
              <t>A priority is protection against RFC Editor service
              interruptions. Included are improvements in documentation of
              editorial practices and processes, Series access, guidance for
              authors, and the RFC Editor web site. Support for end-user ease
              of understanding what RFCs are required to implement specific
              services, persistent name technology, and others, have been
              cited by community members.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>A balance must be maintained between (i) demands of RFC
          production, and (ii) RFC Editor and Series development. <list>
              <t>During 2010, RFC production worked well - confirming that
              part of the model - in part because it allows editorial staff to
              focus on production. Staff must participate in Editor and Series
              development, which must be balanced with production work. This
              balance can be assured only by having an experienced,
              knowledgeable, manager with explicit responsibility for the
              performance of the entire Editor.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>As defined in RFC 5620, RFC Editor management structure is
          complex and unclear.<list>
              <t>The Series Editor is responsible for resolving policy issues
              and providing "executive level management" of their
              implementation, but does not have authority to assign resources.
              Today, this gap is filled by the IAD and IAOC, which are not
              structured for the requisite publications expertise or focus.
              There is also a regular oversight meeting during and between
              IETF meetings, called by the IAD, and attended by the IAOC
              chair, the streams, AMS staff and management, and the Series
              Editor. The IAB, to which the RSE reports, has a very heavy
              workload, multiple competing priorities, and is not structured
              for publications expertise. Clarifying authority and
              responsibility is required to attract a qualified Series
              Editor.</t>
            </list></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The major design choices in <xref target="I-D.v2-overview"></xref>,
      and thus the recommended changes to <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>
      are:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Balancing operation and development of the RFC Editor and the
          Series requires leadership by a single professional who has
          authority over each part of the RFC Editor (with production
          delegated to contractors), the separate development of each,
          operation of the RFC Editor as a whole, and for overall development
          of the RFC Editor and the Series.</t>

          <t>Community interests will be best supported if there is one person
          responsible to the community for all RFC Editor issues, and to whom
          the community can point if the RFC Editor is not acting in the
          community's interest. This person must have no other interests.</t>

          <t>The RFC Series Editor role requires an experienced manager with
          expertise in technical writing, technical publishing, and technical
          series development.</t>

          <t>To ensure the fact and visibility of working in the community
          interest, and to support the Series Editor, <xref
          target="I-D.v2-overview"></xref> adds an RFC Editor Oversight
          Committee, whose members will be drawn from the community and have
          prior experience in publications. The now-redundant RFC Series
          Advisory Group would be disbanded, although a slow transition is
          recommended to maintain institutional memory.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The proposed Series Editor role is conceptually equivalent to the
      head of a publications department in a technical organization.</t>

      <t>The community has not yet converged on a common view of the span of
      authority and responsibility of the Series Editor, the type and level of
      expertise required, or the structure of RFC Editor oversight. Through a
      description of the work of the RFC Series Editor as performed during
      2010 and related observations, this memo seeks to motivate necessary
      changes to the Series Editor, including attracting suitable, qualified
      candidates.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="What Does the RFC Editor Do?">
      <t>The following is based on my experience as TRSE during 2010. I call
      out those cases where the role differs from RFC Editor Model (Version 1)
      described in <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>, based on how the role
      presented itself to me, and as a consequence how I now believe it needs
      to be organized.</t>

      <t>RFC Editor output is produced through two functions: the RFC
      Production Center (or RPC), and RFC Publisher (the 'Publisher'). Per
      <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>, the Series Editor provides
      "Executive-Level management". During 2010, In order to observe how the
      model is currently working, I intervened as little as possible in RPC or
      Publisher activities.</t>

      <t>Here is a review of some aspects of performance that I observed:
      <list>
          <t>Day-to-Day, the RFC Editor Model works well for basic RFC
          production and publication. <list>
              <t>During 2010, RFC production has been steady. There is general
              satisfaction with the rate and quality of output, with the
              service provided by the editorial staff, and with their
              responsiveness. Staff of the Production Center and Publisher
              staff understand their jobs and are focused; I did not observe
              anything blocking their performance.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Day-to-Day, the streams model works well. <list>
              <t>The participants in and leadership of each of the streams
              appear to understand the scope of their subject areas. I have
              not observed any problems, nor heard any substantive concerns,
              about how each should use the services of the Editor. All
              discussions of inter-stream conflicts were satisfactorily
              resolved by the concerned parties, following documented
              procedures</t>
            </list></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>I observe that, following many years of experience and refinement,
      the RFC Editor is highly organized for steady-state RFC production and
      publication using a single, narrow service and editorial model. However,
      this is not the entire range of required RFC Editor services, as I will
      describe in following sections.</t>

      <section title="Editing Work is Performed by Production Center Staff">
        <t>The RFC Production Center (RPC) center is provided by AMS under
        contract. It performs regular RFC Editor document production. AMS also
        provides the RFC Publisher service.</t>

        <t>Following generally-accepted editorial style and procedures, much
        of which is lore learned by editorial staff over many years, editors
        receive approved documents from the streams; they make textual changes
        for correctness and clarity, and formal changes, such as formatting
        and adding specific boilerplate text; they engage IANA as
        necessary.</t>

        <t>The Production Center has its own director, an AMS staff member.
        She manages the day-to-day activity of the editorial staff, including
        document assignments and customer interaction. She also works as an
        individual contributor alongside the other editorial staff, and is the
        senior and most experienced editor. The Production Center publishes
        regular production reports, comprised primarily of statistics.</t>

        <t>The staff of the Production Center are the Editor&#8217;s most
        frequent point of contact with stream participants and approvers. They
        provide the vast majority of production-oriented services. In excess
        of 90% of drafts come from the IETF stream. Furthermore, the
        Production Center director acts as liaison to the IESG, to whom she
        submits regular reports; these are available on the RFC Editor web
        site. Consequently, the majority of document-oriented interaction and
        support is between the Production Center and one of the four
        streams.</t>

        <t>As with other service organizations dominated by a single user or
        customer, it can be inherently challenging to provide balanced service
        and support to all of the other customers. During the TRSE period, I
        did not observe any problems or complaints in balancing Editor
        resource allocation across the streams. Beyond that, however, there is
        a substantial backlog in non-production services and capabilities that
        have not been adequately addressed or implemented, nor integrated into
        a long-term plan with specific priorities; nor has their content and
        value been sufficiently represented to the community. I address these
        in <xref target="seriesdev"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="How is the RFC Editor Managed?">
        <section title="Coordination and Meetings">
          <t>A weekly teleconference of all RFC Editor staff is attended
          regularly by the:<list style="symbols">
              <t>Series Editor,</t>

              <t>Production Center staff and director,</t>

              <t>AMS management,</t>

              <t>AMS technical staff, and</t>

              <t>Independent Submissions Editor (ISE).</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>During the RFC Editor meeting, ongoing issues and monthly output
          are reviewed and discussed. Topics frequently include issues for
          which current policy is insufficient. These often turn to review and
          analysis of past and current practices, including their origins and
          varying application over the years.</t>

          <t>Attendees are presently based in different locations throughout
          the continental US, plus the Independent Submissions Editor in New
          Zealand. I have not observed any problems arising from the remote
          distribution of staff. To the contrary, everyone appears diligent at
          keeping this from becoming an issue.</t>

          <t>The RSE is RFC Editor liaison to the IAB, for whom he prepares
          regular reports. During 2010, the RSE attended IESG meetings, as a
          visitor sitting in for orientation while TRSE.</t>

          <t>During IETF meetings, the IETF Administrative Director (IAD) also
          calls a regular RFC Editor lunch comprised of the IETF
          Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) chair, stream approver
          chairs, the RPC director and invited staff, AMS management, and the
          RSE. These participants review and discuss overall RFC Editor
          activity as well as stream observations. This is the one regular
          meeting at which most of the leadership cited in the Model meet face
          to face. There is also an RFC Editor teleconference between IETFs,
          also called and led by the IAD, during which RFC Editor issues are
          reviewed. This is consistent with <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>,
          although not explicitly called for.</t>

          <t>Senior RPC staff, the ISE, and RSE, are available to community
          members during IETF meetings.</t>

          <t>The RSAG is unstructured and, except for a regular "Tuesday
          lunch" during IETFs, has no regularly scheduled meetings, nor
          structured reports. Per 5620, the RSAG is available on request of
          the RSE to answer questions, provide advice, and to help formulate
          recommendations to the IAB when necessary.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Why the RFC Editor and Series Still Need a Manager">
        <t>Throughout its entire history, the Editor and the Series have been
        led by a single manager, beginning with Jon Postel and then Joyce
        Reynolds and Bob Braden. The current success of the Editor and the
        Series is due significantly to this historical fact.</t>

        <section title="Scale, Complexity, Formality, and Duration Make Management Inevitable">
          <t>Successful organizations invariably grow along multiple
          dimensions. They get larger and more complex, accumulate practices
          and precedents for decision-making, and become more sophisticated at
          their work and their understanding of their environment. They have
          correspondingly richer and more complex interactions with other
          entities that are evolving similarly. Good organizations strive to
          keep their structure and practices simple, and to avoid creating
          unnecessary bureaucracy. However, scale and duration have implicit
          overheads that cannot be ignored. All these things are true of the
          I* and the RFC Editor.</t>

          <t>As organizations grow and as complexity increases, ad hoc
          coordination becomes less and less effective, and the cost of
          failing to coordinate matters increases. In the Editor, when a
          policy issue arises it presents a practical problem: a decision
          needs to be made but extensive discussion and coordination is nearly
          always required. Resolution is not necessarily obvious or
          straightforward, and there may be broad implications. Making
          concerted decisions is especially important because the community
          wants I* entities to be responsive - to their comments, questions,
          requests for information, and requests for changes or corrections to
          problems. Someone needs to be sure these processes are managed well,
          and brought to timely conclusions.</t>

          <t>The I* has grown sufficiently large and complex that issues which
          appear to be simple are often very subtle, and their resolution may
          have far-reaching conclusions sensitive to the particulars of the
          decision. For the RFC Editor, someone has to own that effort. The
          point person must vet it past experts, bring it to the community,
          anticipate the consequences of the different options, and be
          insightful at finding a suitable outcome when the right choice may
          be far from obvious.</t>

          <t>We need to acknowledge that such activities cannot be managed in
          an ad hoc way, nor should they be assigned to staff that have
          regular production duties - the split interest would mean serving
          both purposes poorly.</t>

          <t>There is another oft-neglected point. Explicit assignments of
          responsibility let everyone know who is responsible. If responsible
          parties are good at their jobs and are transparent about their work,
          everyone knows how the decisions are being made. This markedly
          reduces the overheads suffered by suspicion-prone (meaning just
          about all) organizations. If, on the contrary, responsible parties
          are not formally and publicly appointed, then others will surely
          step in when they think they are needed, often with the best of
          intentions, but will too often make decisions that align more with
          their particular perspectives than with the long-term interests of
          the broader community.</t>
        </section>

        <section title=" The Community's Way of Doing Business Has its Own Overhead">
          <t>Every organization has its own style for doing business,
          including the I* entities. The I*'s preference for open
          participation and extensive discussion ensures that all major
          changes require significant effort by a representative of the RFC
          Editor.</t>

          <t>This has two broad consequences. First, many initiatives should
          be carefully considered and developed before they are taken to the
          community. Not doing so can waste valuable time and cause
          unnecessary contention while the actual issue is still being
          clarified. Nevertheless, community review will often require a
          substantial amount of attention and calendar time to make progress.
          This is the environment in which the RFC Editor finds itself, and it
          may account for some of the historical debate about its purposes and
          processes. The second is that, serving the community in this
          environment requires a dedicated, focused expert who has no other
          interests, who can devote the time (including months or years of
          developing perspectives) and energy to make this process work.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="What Does the RFC Series Editor Do?">
        <t>Per <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>, the primary job of the RSE is
        to lead development of new policy when current policy is insufficient.
        RFC activity in this area may originate from within the RFC Editor,
        the community, other I-star entities, or from the Series Editor's own
        work. The Series Editor does this work in conjunction with the Editor,
        the RSAG (or the REOC in the future), and the community, and involves
        the IAB as necessary to ensure compliance with community interest and
        appropriate processes.</t>

        <t>The Series Editor provides guidance when the layer below - the
        Production Center staff or the Publisher - encounters a situation that
        is not clearly covered by existing policies or practices. RFC 5620
        calls for the Series Editor to carry such issues to the RSAG and the
        community for discussion and resolution. However, <xref
        target="RFC5620"></xref> is silent about the authority of the Series
        Editor over RPC and the Publisher when small issues arise day to day,
        or when the Series Editor must make resource allocation decisions.</t>

        <t>Per <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>, and as practiced this year, the
        Series Editor does not participate in day-to-day production and
        publication activities, or any other regular production activities.
        The RSE, like any other manager, does not do the work of the layer
        that reports to him (although the analogy is limited; under <xref
        target="RFC5620"></xref>, the RPC does not report to the RSE). The RSE
        is not and should not act as a "team leader", a supervisor who is also
        a regular individual contributor working alongside other team
        members.</t>

        <t>During 2010, as RSE I participated in the following, also
        consistent with <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>:<list style="symbols">
            <t>requests for policy clarification and decisions from the
            Production Center,</t>

            <t>questions from, and discussion with, the community and
            beyond,</t>

            <t>regular weekly meetings of the RFC Editor, per above,</t>

            <t>various general meetings, including three IETFs (Anaheim,
            Maastricht, and Beijing), and</t>

            <t>liaison and reporting to the IAB, including participating in
            regular teleconferences and occasional retreats.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>I also responded to an author complaint by initiating an escalation
        procedure. However, <xref target="RFC5620"></xref> does not clearly
        authorize the RSE to do so.</t>

        <t>The RSE activities I describe here are exclusive of my TRSE
        activities. The latter consisted of research, surveying the community,
        preparing and delivering various interim presentations and reports,
        and the production and discussions of my final recommendations.</t>

        <t>Immediately below, I describe in more detail Editor-originated
        policy discussions of issues that arose from the community and beyond,
        and from my experience performing an escalation procedure.</t>

        <section title="Addressing questions and problems from within the RFC Editor">
          <t>When RFC Editor staff comes upon an issue not addressed by
          current editorial policy, that issue becomes an agenda item at the
          next RFC Editor meeting. It is impressive how complex these issues
          can be, how often they touch upon many different dimensions of
          Editor work and the Series, how intricate and extensive their
          implications can be for Editor practices and the Series, and how
          much investigation it can take to pry loose all the issues. If we
          are unable to resolve a question swiftly, as RSE I bring it to the
          RSAG</t>

          <t>During this period, typically several issues typically arose each
          month from within the RFC Editor. All required significant
          discussion. We usually asked the following sorts of questions:<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>What exactly is the issue?</t>

              <t>Is the issue reasonable, and is there a genuine need for
              resolution?</t>

              <t>Is it already covered by existing editorial policy, or will
              it require an editorial policy addition or reduction, or other
              permanent change, or a one-time exception to policy?</t>

              <t>What implications might this have for how the relevant
              stream, and the other streams, will use the Series in the
              future?</t>

              <t>Is the policy in question tightly linked, or derived from,
              some other policy? If so, who are the relevant authorities
              (e.g., a stream) and how should that be handled?</t>

              <t>Is this an isolated case that can be resolved by the Editor,
              or is it significant enough, or does it have serious enough
              consequences, to require discussion by the community or the
              IAB?</t>

              <t>What sort of effect might the proposed change have on readers
              and end-users?</t>

              <t>What short and long-term effects might it have on the
              Series?</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The important questions often concerned impact on RFC Editor
          processes and the Series, and the Series&#8217; long-term character.
          During 2010 we were not presented with issues primarily having to do
          with technical writing. Nor did we see issues with significant
          computer-scientific content related to protocols - that is, issues
          outside the scope of the Editor. I provide here an example of issues
          presented to and discussed within the Editor, after which I review
          my experience in leading an "escalation procedure".</t>
        </section>

        <section title="RSE Activity Example: Ensuring and Improving Access to RFCs">
          <t>Early this year, we received a request from a company doing
          business with the US Government. Among other things, they wanted to
          know how to fill out a required form on the sources of IETF
          standards, including the publisher of RFCs. The RPC sought guidance
          because there was no previous policy about who is the publisher of
          RFCs. After brief discussion we realized there was no obvious
          answer. I took that issue to the RSAG.</t>

          <t>This also triggered a discussion about the RFC Series' ISSN
          (International Standard Series Number). ISSNs are often used to
          search for periodicals and disambiguate references. During 2008, the
          IETF Trust obtained an ISSN for the Series from the ISSN
          International Centre. However, we weren't sure whether the ISSN was
          still valid (or what the policy was for expiration), or whether we'd
          already answered questions therein about who is the publisher of
          RFCs. We checked and confirmed that our ISSN was still valid.</t>

          <t>We were unable to find any reference to our ISSN over the web,
          nor through any of the major electronic card catalogs. No one had
          apparently been assigned responsibility for following through after
          obtaining the ISSN. I contacted old colleagues at one of the largest
          universities libraries in the world, and had them add the Series
          ISSN to their card catalog. Nearly all major libraries
          cross-reference their catalogs, so our ISSN can now be found all
          over the world.</t>

          <t>I mention this to provide a distinct example of loose ends around
          the management of the availability of the Series. If someone out in
          the world uses the same sorts of tools that the community does, and
          looks at things the way the community does, then there is a good
          chance they will be able to find the Series, get to the web site,
          and continue from there. But, for someone not like us, for instance
          an academic, it may be a different story entirely. And access is an
          identified priority for the Editor and the Series.</t>

          <t>These examples may appear small, but they sum to significantly
          reduced Series availability. They also illustrate how the Editor,
          outside of document production, depends upon someone&#8217;s just
          happening to notice an issue - that someone typically being a random
          volunteer willing to take initiative.</t>

          <t>This is not a criticism of anyone involved in these issues. In
          the past, there has been such a narrow focus on production, probably
          necessarily so, that this sort of broader management was not given
          the necessary priority. The best remedy will be to task someone with
          general assignments (e.g., "ensure access"), to develop a big
          picture, seek out all the relevant parts, and then be given the
          authority and resources to drive those issues to completion.</t>

          <t>The RFC Editor is uniquely positioned within the I*: it is a
          major formal vehicle through which the world obtains the work of the
          community. It is vital that this Editor ensures availability to the
          entire world, especially when many people may not use the same
          access techniques, as does the community.</t>

          <t>A related subject is that we have not posted convenient examples
          for how RFCs should be referred to in other documents. This lack of
          guidance increases the chance that references will be inaccurate or
          ambiguous. Work has already been done on increasing the vitality,
          breadth of use, influence, and stature of the Series by
          demonstrating that RFCs are as rigorously reviewed as publications
          in conventional academic journals. Early in January 2010, RSAG
          members Brian Carpenter and Craig Partridge published
          &#8220;Internet requests for comments (RFCs) as scholarly
          publications&#8221; in ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication
          Review.</t>

          <t>Apprised of these developments, I called for the formation of an
          &#8220;RSE Committee&#8221; on Citations. A member of the RFC Series
          Advisory Group (RSAG) led this committee whose membership came from
          the community (a general call was made for members on the
          rfc-interest list.) They were asked to:<list style="symbols">
              <t>determine the right ISSN entry format for the RFC series and
              ensure it is accessible in the global database of library
              electronic card catalogs (WorldCat),</t>

              <t>determine how documents in the RFC series should cite other
              RFCs,</t>

              <t>recommend how RFCs should be cited using the ACM, IEEE and
              MLA reference formats, and</t>

              <t>recommend how RFCs should be represented in Bibtex.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>This assignment conveniently combined issues of the ISSN and
          library user access issues with those of reference examples.</t>

          <t>The committee has been working on these related issues during
          2010 and I expect to see their recommendations shortly. Those will
          be vetted by the RSAG and posted for discussion and review by the
          community.</t>

          <t>The Series Editor's choice of this new, experimental model for
          addressing Editor issues demonstrates how the RSE can have
          significant positive influence, by crafting ways to investigate and
          develop issues. In the future, this should be done with the advice
          and consent of the RFC Editor Oversight Committee.</t>

          <t>An important part of the managerial expertise required of the RSE
          is not just to know how to investigate issues and drive them to
          conclusion, but to know how best to harness the interest of the
          community in the process. Doing this well will improve overall
          outcomes by insuring their alignment with community interest.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="RFC Editor Escalation Procedure">
          <t>During 2010, I received only one significant complaint about
          editorial performance. How this was handled is useful input into
          understanding the sort of managerial activities that will
          occasionally, and unavoidably, be required.</t>

          <t>The complaint was from the author of a document while it was
          being edited. After extensive discussions with the author and the
          RPC staff member and director I was unable to satisfy the author and
          initiated an escalation procedure. Since there was no procedure
          specified for dealing with such cases, I notified the RSAG and the
          IAB, kept them apprised of my activities, and frequently requested
          feedback as the process unfolded.</t>

          <t>I reviewed RPC editorial practices and performance with the
          voluntary support of the Independent Submission Editor (ISE). RPC
          management was highly responsive and supportive. I communicated my
          observations to the author.</t>

          <t>Neither the specifics of the complaint nor the outcome are
          significant. What is significant, however, is that this case
          illustrates a general limitation of <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>,
          which does not clearly assign (to the Series Editor or to anyone
          else) authority for initiating or managing such a procedure. Nor
          does it do so more broadly by, for example, assigning authority for
          day-to-day oversight of the RFC Editor. The most obvious candidates
          for this responsibility would be the IAD and IAOC due to their
          contractual oversight role, or to the Series Editor. I found that
          this task required a high degree of editorial background, and
          knowledge of current practices and the immediate circumstances of
          the RFC Editor. Furthermore, as I requested time and attention from
          RPC staff, it became clear that there would be noticeable impact on
          the rate of RFCs output by the Editor. However, <xref
          target="RFC5620"></xref> does not give the RSE authority or
          responsibility for Editor output, which could cause him to pay
          insufficient attention to any impact on productivity. Finally,
          although the RPC director was exceptionally supportive, this might
          not have been the case. The RSE needs sufficient authority to insist
          upon support, in case future RPC management is not as
          enlightened.</t>

          <t>I also observed that the procedure, as performed, required far
          more than simple expertise in technical writing. Issues that came to
          light included:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>Should we have more than one level of editorial service, to
              include, for example, elevated priority or assignment of more
              experienced editors in the case of especially complex documents
              or those with problematic audiences?</t>

              <t>If there are to be different levels of service, or if there
              are more frequent complaints, how much time and effort should be
              invested in either, and how should those be prioritized against
              production of other RFCs?</t>

              <t>Where is the dividing line, between authors of drafts and
              editorial staff, for responsibility for editing quality?</t>

              <t>Should the RFC Editor ever recommend that an author seek the
              assistance of an outside editor, prior to submission; and if so,
              based upon what criteria?</t>

              <t>How should escalation procedures be performed in the
              future?</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Responding to questions of this sort with appropriate procedures
          requires an understanding of technical writing practices, experience
          managing the editing of publications, and sensitivity to the
          long-term implications of any intervention for the character and
          quality of the series. Experts should guide the resolution of these
          sorts of issues. Furthermore, insofar as it is possible, leadership
          should be continuous (that is, fixed to a role and not assigned on a
          case-by-case basis) to provide institutional memory in case there
          are repeated reviews.</t>

          <t>I observe a gap in <xref target="RFC5620"></xref> between
          day-to-day production by the RPC, and the policy development and
          execution authority of the RSE. I recommend that this gap be filled
          by the RSE, the only person who will have the requisite editorial
          and managerial expertise. The RSE should be responsible for, and
          have authority over, Editor output. I also observe that day-to-day
          oversight by the Editor requires a level of experience beyond that
          of the IAD and the IAOC.</t>

          <t>Finally, there is an issue of community and I* responsibility to
          professional staff. If we are going to evaluate staff, that
          evaluation must be led by our most qualified people. This not only
          includes critical analysis of work performance and subsequent
          recommendations and implementing of remedies. It also includes
          defending our professionals' performance when they are doing their
          work well under contentious or politically charged circumstances.
          Doing anything less is organizationally irresponsible and risks
          unfair treatment of our contractors' staff. Only a knowledgeable,
          continuously involved, authorized professional manager and
          supervisor can reasonably satisfy this requirement.</t>

    <section title="Differences between V2-Overview and RFC 5620">
      <section title="General and Design Strategy Differences">
        <t><xref target="RFC5620"></xref> aims to ensure community control by
        dividing responsibility for the RFC Editor into multiple functions,
        allowing each to be contracted or appointed separately: the Production
        Center, Publisher, Series Editor and RSAG, and the Independent
        Submissions Editor and Independent Submissions Editorial Board. This
        division permits each part to focus on its mission. It also permits
        the community to more clearly see the performance of each part, which
        facilitates performance review. Indeed, this breaking out of the
        Production Center and Publisher has been highly successful.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC5620"></xref> does an excellent job of
        establishing part-by-part focus on each Editor component, but its
        &#8220;divided responsibility&#8221; strategy, carried all the way up
        to the oversight of RFC Editor operations, does not establish any
        corresponding integration of managing the operation of the Editor.</t>

        <t>The IAOC and IAD continue their historical authority for management
        of the contracts, and the IAB for arms-length oversight. This is
        appropriate for those specific responsibilities. However, as defined
        in <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>, the Series Editor has authority
        only for what is left over: exploring and discussing issues as they
        arise from the community or within the Editor. Unfortunately the
        result is a minimal and apparently unappealing job.</t>

        <t>Though not obvious from a first reading of <xref
        target="RFC5620"></xref>, my experience of day-to-day operation of the
        RFC Editor and performance of the Series Editor role exposed a
        critical flaw: no one entity or person is assigned responsibility for
        bringing together all the different inputs from the Editor, plus input
        from the community and beyond, and making them all work together under
        the very serious demands of document production. This is required so
        that the RFC Editor as a whole operates smoothly and efficiently.</t>

        <t>This lack of defined overall management authority also contributed
        to the failure to find a satisfactory candidate.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC5620"></xref> distributes authority for the Editor
        across two committees and two managers. This division is problematic.
        Committees are widely understood to be excellent at ensuring that
        multiple interests are addressed, but not at integrating inputs into a
        single, focused plan, nor for driving insights when developing such
        plans. Committees also, often with the best of intentions, suffer from
        having divided interests. Being comprised of members from disparate
        entities or parts of the community, they may, even unknowingly, have
        divided interests. This applies to the management structure in <xref
        target="RFC5620"></xref>. Without some one person assigned
        responsibility for overall management and development of the Editor,
        the community has a very difficult, perhaps impossible job, of knowing
        who is responsible for what is being done, and whom to talk to when
        there is dissatisfaction.</t>

        <t>Furthermore, <xref target="RFC5620"></xref> explicitly chooses not
        to define a reporting structure for the RFC Editor. Instead, it treats
        the reporting structure as an implementation detail, to be established
        or changed by the IAOC on a case-by-case basis. There are three issues
        associated with this approach. First, the duration and intensity of
        community debate indicates that this issue needs to be resolved by the
        community as a basic design decision of the Editor. Second, reporting
        structure is fundamental to defining the RSE role, including
        qualifications and level of experience. Finally, it is extremely
        unlikely, as has already been demonstrated, that a motivated,
        qualified profession would accept that the reporting structure is to
        be determined in the future. <xref target="I-D.v2-overview"></xref>
        brings this decision to the fore for community consideration. It also
        makes future changes to the reporting structure substantive,
        permitting changes only with the approval of the IAB.</t>

        <t>V2 Overview makes the Series Editor responsible to the community
        for the overall performance and operation of the RFC Editor. In this
        way the community will always know who is responsible for the Editor
        and the Series, and that the Series Editor has no other interest.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Specific Differences">
        <section title="Series Editor Authority and Supervisory Duties">
          <t>Under <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>, the responsibilities of the
          Series Editor are limited and insufficient. The Series Editor is
          responsible for addressing shortfalls in policy by taking them to
          the RSAG and the community for discussion and community resolution
          and, as required, confirmation by the IAB. The RSE is also
          responsible for 'implementation', without explaining what this means
          and without empowering the RSE to achieve implementation. That is,
          <xref target="RFC5620"></xref> does not state that the RSE has
          authority to direct the resources of the Editor (the Production
          Center and Publisher) in any implementation. It is likely that in
          many cases the Production Center would temporarily need to reduce
          their rate of document output in order to implement a new policy,
          and would need to be directed to take such actions. The RSE should
          be able to provide directions to do so after discussion and review
          by the streams and the REOC. However, under <xref
          target="RFC5620"></xref> the RSE would need to seek permission from
          the contract administrators, the IAOC or IAD. This is problematic.
          First, understanding the impact of any change on RFC production is
          best done by someone who has intimate knowledge of the production
          process, and to ensure community alignment; this should be done by
          under Series Editor leadership with the Production Center director.
          Second, putting control in the hands of the IAOC (or IAD) is
          problematic in that the IAOC and IAD are not structured for such
          publications expertise, and have multiple responsibilities that
          could conceivably compete with their attention to this subject.
          Finally, not having this sort of responsibility, and instead having
          to go through "contracts administration" (which is how it could be
          perceived) each time there was a sub-contract level change, would be
          unnecessary overhead, and very likely unacceptable to any qualified
          RSE candidate.</t>

          <t>Supervision should be the responsibility of the most
          knowledgeable and experienced manager available. If there is to be
          an RSE, why not assign a direct supervisory role to the position,
          rather than put supervision in the hands of staff that are less
          knowledgeable (w/r/t editing and publications)? The same argument
          applies to reviews of performance. The RSE should lead reviews of
          the performance of the contractors, while the IAOC should lead
          annual reviews of Editor performance overall.</t>

          <t>Nothing here is an argument against oversight, which this memo
          maintains is required. RFC Editor oversight must be focused, must
          have a suitable level of understanding or experience in publication,
          and must support the RSE via an "advise and consent" model.</t>

          <t>The sorts of issues managed by the RFC Editor are different from
          those of the IAD and IAOC. The IAD and IAOC regularly agree to new
          contracts with significant financial exposure for the overall
          organization. The RSE will only rarely (perhaps once every few
          years) be involved in teamwork regarding major financial commitments
          (for example, when RFC Production Center and Publisher contracts are
          renewed or re-bid). Most of the time, the RSE will be involved
          primarily in many small daily and weekly decisions regarding
          editorial and publication work and policies. Such decisions will
          only occasionally have contractual consequences. In this case, it is
          not necessary to have the same degree of executive involvement by
          the REOC, as is the case with the IAOC.</t>

        <section title="RFC Editor Oversight Committee and RSAG">
          <t>Under 5620, the IAB provides oversight for the RFC Editor both in
          terms of chartered responsibility and regular reporting. However,
          the IAB is involved in a great many priority issues that compete
          with the RFC Editor, and cannot give a great deal of time or
          attention to the RFC Editor. Furthermore, the skill set required of
          IAB members conflicts with the skill set required of those who would
          directly oversee the RFC Editor and RSE.</t>

          <t>Under <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>, the RSAG is an informal
          advisory body with no authority for oversight of the Series or the
          RSE. Having oversight authority would be awkward at best, since it
          is the Series Editor who nominates RSAG members.</t>

          <t>V2 Overview calls for the formation of an RFC Editor Oversight
          Committee (REOC), that follows an &#8220;advise and consent&#8221;
          model to support the Series Editor and ensure alignment with
          community interests. This committee is structured to focus strictly
          on RFC Editor issues, and should be populated with members with
          significant interest, experience and expertise in the area of
          technical editing, publishing, and the Series itself. This is not a
          re-labeling of the RSAG. The REOC is selected differently (by the
          IAB, not the RSE), has a different mission (oversight, not strictly
          advice), and real authority (consent, which may be denied).</t>

          <t>The role of the REOC is significantly different from that of the
          IAOC, in spite of having a similar name. The IAOC is directly
          involved in contractual, legal, and financial matters at the
          administrative level, and at least 3 times a year has to
          investigate, plan, and make major financial commitments for IETF
          meetings. The RSE and REOC will only be involved in such matters
          every few years, as the contracts for the RPC and Publisher renew.
          Even then, the RSE and REOC will be involved primarily as
          publications subject matter experts and not as financial
          administrators or contracts specialists. Rather, the RSE and REOC
          will focus on the large number of policy and operational issues, and
          their complex interactions and relative priorities that are of
          interest to the Editor and thus to the community.</t>

          <t>This motivates the "advise and consent" REOC model, in place of
          having the RSE reporting to a management committee. The RSE should
          have far more publications and editorial expertise than the
          collective of the REOC, have much more intimate knowledge of all the
          day-to-day issues, and should thus be able to take a more leading
          role - all the while with the consent of the REOC. This approach
          will ensure alignment with community interest while encouraging
          initiative and innovation.</t>

          <t>The IAB will retain its chartered responsibility for the RFC
          Editor, and will be consulted by the REOC on substantive policy
          questions. Thus the IAB will be relieved from involvement in
          day-to-day questions by delegating much of its oversight role to the
          REOC.</t>

        <section title="Decommissioned RFC Series Advisory Group">
          <t>In <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>, RFC Series Advisory Group
          (RSAG) members are nominated by the RSE and approved by the IAB. The
          RSAG has few formal duties. V2 Overview decommissions the RSAG to
          avoid redundancy with the REOC and thus reduce committee overhead.
          For transparency, <xref target="I-D.v2-overview"></xref> states that
          the Series Editor may have advisors, and that their names should be
          publicized. There is nevertheless a need for continuity and
          maintenance of institutional memory within the RFC Editor. The RSAG
          members should be asked to remain on board at least until the REOC
          is fully oriented and up to speed. This is consistent with the text
          in V2 Overview that states that the RSE may have informal advisors.
          (Since that text is not strictly necessary, it may be removed from
          V2 Overview depending on community input.)</t>

          <t>Although not a major design flaw, it is notable that <xref
          target="RFC5620"></xref> takes a contradictory approach to the RSAG.
          RSAG has no real authority, being largely an informal team of
          advisors nominated by the RSE. Membership under such terms does not
          typically require approval, although <xref target="RFC5620"></xref>
          mandates IAB approval of RSAG nominees. <xref
          target="I-D.v2-overview"></xref> corrects this situation by
          disbanding the RSAG, giving the REOC significant authority, and
          mandating IAB authority for selecting REOC members.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="The IAOC and IAD">
          <t><xref target="I-D.v2-overview"></xref> does not call for any
          change in the chartered responsibilities of the IAOC. It does
          explicitly propose to have the RSE (as the resident editorial and
          publications expert) join the IAOC when it is reviewing contractor
          performance, re-issuing of contracts, preparing requests for
          proposals, and reviewing bids.</t>

        <section title="The Series Editor and General Management Issues">
          <t>V2 Overview gives the Series Editor exclusive direct management
          over its facilities by assigning him responsibility for overall
          performance of the Editor. All current regular meetings should be
          reviewed, and possibly put under RSE management, to avoid any
          confusion about where Editor directions are coming from.</t>

    <section anchor="seriesdev" title="RFC Editor and Series Development Work">
      <t>The following steps to improve the series and its accessibility are
      based on input from community members and on my own experience and
      analysis. Unless otherwise stated, these are areas requiring eventual
      attention, not a list of efforts that the RSE should necessarily engage
      in immediately. Each will require leadership by the Series Editor to
      ensure responsiveness, knowledgeable discussion within the community,
      and reasonable progress towards a consensus solution. Leadership is also
      necessary to ensure correct prioritization of this type of work, and
      that all changes work well together.</t>

      <t>Because the work of the community is done almost entirely by
      volunteers, the Series Editor should be careful not to interfere with or
      replace volunteer activities. Very often the Series Editor will not
      actually direct various activities but rather will make sure that
      critical issues are being addressed and that participants are aware of
      the big picture.</t>

      <section title="Update, Improve, and Reorganize the Style Manual">
        <t>The RFC Style Manual (or 'Guide') is a lightly organized collection
        of seven web pages on the RFC Editor site. Those include several
        different documents (one of which is an expired Internet Draft);
        various parts are redundant; and there is limited information to guide
        the novice's use of and interpretation of the Manual. One community
        member mentioned that various parts of the RFC style were a major
        input to the style guide of his own corporation (a major software
        developer). His colleagues need to be able to refer to the RFC Style
        Manual, which they say they cannot do in its present state. Fixing
        this problem will increase the consistency and stature of the
        Series.</t>

        <t>The Style Manual as it stands is insufficient to direct substitute
        editors in case of an unexpected break in service. The Manual should
        be reorganized, consolidated, and updated as necessary. This should
        include a part-by-part review for currency and accuracy.</t>

        <t>Community members have suggested the Manual be divided into two
        sections: a small, slowly evolving core of 'musts' to be enforced by
        Editor staff. This core should be kept as minimal and straightforward
        as possible. It should be augmented by a larger, more quickly
        developing set of guidelines for authors, possibly in a separate
        document. The core information should be published as an RFC, while
        more frequently changing sections (e.g., the abbreviations list) could
        be left to (or incrementally updated as) web pages.</t>

        <t>The Editor does not presently recommend any general style manuals
        (e.g., The (University of) Chicago Manual of Style) to guide authors
        above and beyond the RFC Editor Style Manual. The Editor should do so,
        but, to ensure that the Series does not become stylistically narrow,
        might better suggest several widely accepted style manuals that
        authors might refer to than require their adherence to one particular
        manual.</t>

        <t>The above are rough suggestions. General and detailed decisions
        should be left up to the incoming Series Editor with support from the
        Editor staff, REOC members, and in concert with the community. The new
        Series Editor should consider establishing a standing committee
        comprising knowledgeable people from each of these groups. I see no
        reason why there cannot be far more direct participation by the
        community in this effort than in the past.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Develop and Publish a Procedures Manual">
        <t>There is no one place (particularly, not among the RFC Editor web
        pages) where one can find a definitive description of the processes
        followed by the Editor, and how the Editor interacts with the Streams.
        As previously identified, the Procedures Manual, along with the Style
        Manual, is the core device for ensuring quick guidance of alternate
        editors in case of an unexpected interruption in service. As with the
        Style Manual, a comprehensive effort should be undertaken to collect
        all relevant policies in one place, once again involving staff,
        committees and knowledgeable community members.</t>

        <t>Particular attention should be paid to documenting procedures at
        the correct level of detail. Many procedures fall near the boundary
        between common sense, editorial lore, and a need for formal
        documentation. The Procedures Manual should be designed to permit
        incremental addition over the years; all participants should guard
        against adding more detail than is necessary.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Improvements to the RFC Editor Web Pages">
        <t>Community members frequently assert that the RFC Editor web site is
        rudimentary, has an old-style look and feel, and needs to be
        reorganized for clarity. The web site is a key entry point for access
        to the Series, and especially to facilitate new authors' understanding
        of how to write an Internet draft on the way to publishing an RFC.
        Given the community's increasingly international membership, adding
        support for languages other than English may in time be
        appropriate.</t>

        <t>The Series Editor should consult with the Oversight Committee and
        the community to explore how the site might be improved, and formulate
        a plan for doing so depending upon acquisition of resources including
        volunteers.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Investigate Enhanced Training for RFC Authors">
        <t>The Editor provides an orientation for draft writers during the
        IETF week that focuses on draft- and RFC-specific issues. Enlarging
        this orientation to provide general guidance for how to write
        technical documents could we an efficient was to assist both authors
        and production center staff. I am not suggesting that the Series
        Editor personally provide this training, which requires very specific
        skills. Rather, the RSE should join with the streams to identify if
        there are efficiencies to be gained by one or more types of such
        training, and to determine if a plan should be developed for obtaining
        that training, which can be very expensive to produce. Contracting
        with an outside training organization is one option.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Investigate Providing Support for RFCs in Additional Languages">
        <t>Our community is constantly becoming more international. Some
        suggest we may be asked, for example, to improve the ease of
        participation by non-native English speakers by providing pointers to
        unofficial translations of RFCs. We may eventually wish to certify
        such translations as being within certain quality criteria. The RFC
        Editor&#8217;s responsibilities may grow to include ensuring that such
        requests by community participants (or RFC end-users) are handled
        expeditiously. If work begins in this area, it should be done in
        concert with other internationalization efforts, such as support for
        non-English languages in the RFC Editor web site, as mentioned
        above.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Consider Supporting RFC Clusters and Enhanced RFC Annotation">
        <t>At present, if one wishes to know the relationships between various
        RFCs, one has to read the metadata and &#8216;walk&#8217; from RFC to
        RFC. Also, despite the enormous body of knowledge in the community,
        there is no commonly available facility that describes:<list
            style="symbols">
            <t>clusters of RFCs and their relationships (a
            &#8216;cluster&#8217; is any collection of RFC that are of
            interest to someone who has collected information on them),</t>

            <t>annotations of RFCs, (these could include, for example, notes
            provided by readers of RFCs indicating their experience as they
            implemented a particular service; annotations could be graded for
            usefulness, using a reader-entered ranking system),</t>

            <t>service descriptors (anyone wishing to implement transport, for
            example, could use descriptors to locate, readily and
            unambiguously, all current RFCs required to implement that
            technology).</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Volunteer work in this area is already under way. The Series Editor
        should informally encourage and support these efforts and investigate
        whether more significant support should be given.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Investigate Formal Persistent Names or Identifiers for RFCs">
        <t>I am told that Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) have become common
        in academic publishing, and that citations more and more often require
        DOIs. We do not presently have any plans to provide URIs (Uniform
        Resource Identifiers) or DOIs for RFCs. The RSE should begin a process
        to determine whether there is a need for such facilities, and if so
        what sort of process should be followed to determine what needs to be
        done and how to do it.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Lead Discussion on Universal Access and the ASCII Format of Normative Versions of RFCs">
        <t>A significant number of community members have noted that
        discussion about the ASCII format goes through cycles of intensity.
        The Series Editor will need to participate in these discussions and
        attempt to make them productive. One of the identified problems is the
        limit of ASCII art. Community members tell me that they cannot produce
        complex mathematical notation using ASCII, which they claim keeps them
        from publishing certain RFCs (if this is so, then our
        universality-oriented policy is keeping some RFCs from being created
        in the first place). Another concern is the impossibility of
        representing author names that require non-ASCII character sets. The
        Series Editor and Oversight Committee should survey community thinking
        on the subject, decide whether and when a comprehensive review should
        take place, and specify the process(es) that review should follow,
        while keeping in mind the need for long-term accessibility of archival
        documents.</t>

    <section title="RSE Time Requirements">
      <section title="General Recommendations ">
        <t>A one-third-time appointment is the absolute minimum for the Series
        Editor position for the appointee to provide ongoing leadership and to
        represent the Editor and the Series on an ongoing basis.</t>

        <t>Additional time is required to discuss, analyze, prioritize,
        communicate, and guide through to implementation the regular flow of
        development issues that come to the Editor (exclusive of ongoing
        document production). Still more time is required to participate in
        exceptional events, such as community controversies or debates,
        customer complaints that could result in escalation procedures, or
        time-consuming external demands. Altogether, these tasks add a minimum
        of roughly 20%-time, to bring the position to a minimum half-time
        appointment.</t>

        <t>An appointment beyond half-time would be reasonable but is not
        strictly required. Above that level depends upon the desire by the
        community for faster or additional Series and Editor development.</t>

                many different activities of the community meet. Recent
                discussions about the standards process are an example. The
                RFC Series Editor needs to follow such discussions to maintain
                general community context, to anticipate impact on the Editor
                or the Series, and to represent his observations. Preparing

                    above.</t>

               title="Additional responsibilities under V2-Overview">
        <t>Under <xref target="I-D.v2-overview"></xref>, time previously
        required for interaction with the IAB and RSAG will be replaced by
        interaction with the REOC.</t>

        <t>I anticipate that the REOC will eventually meet monthly for one to
        two hours, but initially, every two weeks. There will also be somewhat
        more frequent discussions between the RSE and individual REOC members,
        which I anticipate will depend upon the level of Editor and Series
        development work. Overall, I expect that the time devoted to upwards
        reporting will increase slightly compared to past practice.</t>

        <t><list>
            <t>Major Planning Cycles, Annual and Multi-Year: <list>
                <t>In addition to ongoing work there will be annual reviews of
                Editor performance. Also, every few years there will be major
                investments of time devoted to reviews of long-term
                performance of contractors, and constructing new requests for
                proposals.</t>

                <t>Annual reviews of RFC Editor and Publisher:<list>
                    <t>1 week, or 2% time.</t>
                  </list></t>

                <t>This activity slightly increases the average yearly
                commitment of the Series Editor, but does not alter my
                one-third-time recommendation.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>End-of-Contract review of performance of Production Center and
            Publisher: <list>
                <t>This item includes joint work with the IAD and IAOC on
                major reviews, revisions to contracts, creation of new
                requests for proposals (RFPs), preparation for and
                participation in bidders conferences, and reviews of bids.</t>

                <t>End of Contract Reviews: <list>
                    <t>4 weeks (although in case of very large changes, time
                    requirements could be much greater). 8% time.</t>
                  </list></t>

                <t>Because the new contract activities occur so irregularly, I
                do not explicitly include them in the annual baseline. They
                are better considered as part of project work.</t>

      <section title="Which Levels of Appointment Make Practical Sense?">
        <t>Practically speaking, just two work level ranges are sensible and
        would be acceptable to a professional: full-time; or a defined level
        up to and including 50 or 60%.</t>

        <t>Increasing the level much above 50% but not up to 100% could be
        problematic. Few people find themselves able to limit themselves to,
        for instance, an 80% job; at some point there is a strong tendency for
        such a position to become full-time. It is commonplace in our
        industry, and in publishing, for &#8220;full-time&#8221; professionals
        to far exceed 40 hours per week. This indicates that once the
        job&#8217;s minimum time requirements begin to exceed ~60% of a
        nominal 40-hour work week, the community will get much more value for
        money from a full-time employee.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Orientation Time Requirements">
        <t>Learning the Series Editor job will be very time-consuming,
        depending upon the level of orientation and support provided and the
        appointees' prior knowledge of the environment. My experience suggests
        that a relative novice will require approximately 6 months to get up
        to speed; even someone quite familiar with our environment will take
        at least several months. I strongly recommend development of an
        orientation plan, to include multiple orientation meetings (working
        sessions well beyond getting-to-know-you meetings), walks through all
        key RFCs, and extensive review of all other relevant documents and
        processes.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Key Questions and Answers">
      <t>Over the years, the RFC Editor has had progressively narrower scope
      and authority. After removing any influence over the technical content
      of RFCs, splitting out the Independent Submissions Editor role, and
      moving the technical editors into a separate organization, why is an RSE
      necessary at all? <list>
          <t><xref target="RFC5620"></xref>, documenting an earlier consensus,
          mandates an RSE role. My experience in the position has documented
          (above) significant outstanding management and development issues.
          Many of these cannot be ignored and, if not managed explicitly,
          could end up being done in an ad hoc fashion, and quite possibly
          badly. I present reasons, above and below, why a committee is
          unlikely to do the job effectively.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Can&#8217;t the Production Center Director do the job? <list>
          <t>In spite of the excellence of the entire RFC Production Center
          staff at technical writing, and their understanding of the current
          state of Editor practice, they have not had prior experience at the
          sort of work I describe. Furthermore, assigning the RSE role to
          Production Center management could create a problematic division of
          their attention and eventually either the planning or the production
          would suffer. Asking a single person to fill both positions will
          make it more difficult for the community to observe and assess how
          matters are being prioritized. Finally, a very significant part of
          the incoming RSE role will be to review all the editorial and other
          practices of the Editor to develop a real and complete Style Manual
          and a real and complete Procedures Manual; someone other than the
          production staff must do this. Otherwise, the community can have no
          confidence that the process will provide insurance against breaks in
          editorial service. Said differently, Production Staff cannot be
          expected to review themselves, which would be a conflict of
          interest. And, as described below, the necessary review requires
          more, and more continuous, attention and focus than can be expected
          of those volunteers who oversee the RSE.</t>

          <t>I emphasize that these are structural observations and in no way
          any criticism of staff or AMS. All have performed professionally and
          diligently during my tenure.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Can&#8217;t a Community Committee do the Job? <list>
          <t>A committee is simply not a good vehicle for discerning and
          pursuing strategic needs, particularly if the committee has other
          duties or is made up of members with varied interest. A committee
          can provide support, guidance and oversight, but cannot do the
          primary thing this job requires: focus on uncovering Editor issues
          and driving them to conclusion, in combination, and in a way that
          improves the long-term performance of the RFC Editor. That means
          making sense of the entire Editor, its operations, policies and
          relationship to staff, the community and other community entities.
          This includes establishing means to ensure no interruption of
          service. Lessons from management, and past experience in the
          community, argue that a single professional responsible for making
          this happen, and for being accountable for it happening, is
          necessary.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Should the RSE come from the community or should an outsider do the
      job? <list>
          <t>Someone from the community may be able to do the job, but only if
          qualified as defined above and in <xref
          target="I-D.v2-overview"></xref>. However, significant publications
          management experience and expertise in not widely found in the
          community. Furthermore, there is a great opportunity for the
          community to find an experienced outsider who will drive new
          thinking and debate. This is far less likely with someone from the
          community.</t>

          <t>Keep in mind that the REOC and IAB, and an anticipated,
          predictable degree of community participation, will provide a very
          rich and steady flow of community input on all issues.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>After the reductions in the RSE role mentioned above, is there
      anything left to attract an experienced publications professional? <list>
          <t>There can be, if the job is appropriately structured, and
          properly supported by the REOC, IAB, and the community. The RFC
          Series is one of the most important technical collections in
          history. Many qualified professionals would leap at the chance to
          lead the community in improving the Series and the operation of the
          Editor. They would also love to learn how and why this amazing
          Series and innovative community work; this is a real career builder.
          However, the incoming RSE must understand that their job is to lead
          the community in discovering, defining, prioritizing, and agreeing
          on changes, improvements and innovations, and then implementing
          them. (This, in spite of the confusing terminology of the Editor:
          the RFC Editor is actually a publisher, the RFC Publisher is
          actually an archive and access server, and the RFC Series Editor is
          actually the head of a publications department in which there are
          four 'editors' not appointed by the Series Editor -- the four stream
          approvers.) In years past, this might not have been attractive to a
          publication professional, which would have expected far more
          control. However, in significant part thanks to the Internet, the
          world of publications has changed. An example of this is Wikipedia,
          whose leadership provides an environment for a community of writers
          and editors, establishes rules, and lets the world of contributors
          do the rest. However, the role is still somewhat thin compared to
          the degree of autonomy usually granted to professionals leading this
          scale of series and sort of effort. Hence, his having authority over
          the Production Center and Publisher is all the more important; not
          giving the RSE this authority could preclude attracting strong
          candidates.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Can a Volunteer to the Job? <list>
          <t>Of course it is possible, if the community can find someone
          qualified and willing to do the job. However, that appears unlikely,
          for structural reasons. In our community, those who occupy senior
          positions that require a substantial fraction of their time, such as
          membership in the IAB or IESG, require substantial support from
          their employers; this is effectively 'seconding' an employee to the
          volunteer job. Employers do this because of the strategic value and
          stature it brings their organizations. This value is often related
          to the strategic insights and influence that follow from the roles,
          and such value depends on the Community work the 'seconded'
          professional does being strategic to the employer. This does not
          generally apply to editing. Finding an organization in the
          publications world that would support a 'seconding' is unlikely.
          Conclusion: Seeking volunteers, may be a time and energy-consuming
          dead-end. It could be done on a limited basis before reverting to
          seeking a paid professional.</t>

          <t>There is another issue. This job is complex, difficult, rich with
          personalities and opinions. Paying someone to do it may be required
          for him to insure continuity under the challenges and pressures that
          will invariably occur.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>What keeps the Series Editor from having undue influence or
      'capturing' the community and making them dependent upon him? <list>
          <t>First, a major goal of the RSE is to ensure that no one in the
          Editor, or outside the Editor, can have undue influence, and that
          includes him. When writing the documents that ensure quick provision
          of alternate editing resources, he must also document his part in
          those processes and decisions. The REOC should remain diligent about
          this his supporting this requirement, and they have tools at their
          disposal to be sure they can do so. First, the RSE will not have any
          control of his own over Editor resources; my recommendations require
          that he not come from any of the other contractors of Editor
          services. Second, they should have enough expertise to review the
          RSE's work to ensure it is complete. Third, the recommendations
          stipulate a 3-year term of office; long enough to learn the job and
          get good at it, but not long enough to insert himself irreversibly
          into various relationships, and short enough that the clock will run
          out on its own in a reasonable amount of time. Finally, the RSE is a
          planning and oversight job. Except for brief intervals when the RSE
          is critically important to development of some activity, they should
          not be important to any real-time events during which they could
          'squeeze' the community. Professionals being very good at their
          jobs, and providing great value to the community, has nothing to do
          with 'capture'. Using that, or other values, to gain improper
          results of any form in defiance of community will, does.</t>
