Internet-Draft                IMAP filters                 December 2007


1.  Conventions Used in this Document

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Basic familiarity with [METADATA] and terms defined therein is
   required to understand this document.

   [[anchor2: Editorial comments and questions are marked like this.]]


2.  Introduction and Overview

   Persistent named searches described in this document allow clients to
   save favourite searches on the server.  Such saved searches can save
   bandwidth for clients that need to regularly repeat them.

   The IMAP extension for persistent named searches is present in any
   IMAP4 implementation which advertises "X-DRAFT-I01-FILTERS"
   [[anchor4: Note to RFC editor: change upon publication to FILTERS]]
   as one of the supported capabilities in the CAPABILITY response or
   response code.

   Any server compliant with this extension MUST also implement the
   SERVER-METADATA [METADATA]. [[anchor5: Make sure the extension name
   agrees with the per-server extension from the METADATA document]]


3.  IMAP Protocol Changes

3.1.  Registration of a new server entries

   This document reserves hierarchy of entries under the "/filters" root
   (see [METADATA]) for storing named searches (a.k.a. "filters").  The
   "value" ("value.priv" or "value.shared") attribute of a "/filters/
   <filter_name>" server annotation is an IMAP SEARCH criteria,
   conforming to ABNF for the "search-criteria" non-terminal.  A name of
   a filter is governed by ABNF for the "filter-name" non-terminal.

   Note that values of all search keys stored in this annotation MUST be
   encoded in UTF-8.

Internet-Draft                IMAP filters                 December 2007


   A new filter named "<filter_name>" can be created (or an existing
   filter can be modified) by storing a non NIL value in the
   "value.priv" or "value.shared" attribute of a "/filters/
   <filter_name>" entry using the SETMETADATA [METADATA] command.  A
   filter can be deleted by storing the NIL value in the
   "value.priv"/"value.shared" attribute of the "/filters/<filter_name>"
   entry.  A filter can be renamed by first creating a filter with the
   new name and then deleting filter with the old one.

   If both "value.priv" and "value.shared" attributes exist for a
   "/filters/<filter_name>" server annotation, then the "value.priv" is
   used when evaluating the corresponding FILTER SEARCH key (see
   Section 3.2).  Otherwise the non-NIL value is used.


           C: a SETMETADATA "" "/filters/on-the-road"
               (value.priv "OR SMALLER 5000
                   FROM \"boss@example.com\"")
           S: a OK SETMETADATA complete

   Implementation note: As multiple client might read and write filter
   values, it is possible that one client will use a SEARCH key that
   might not be recognized by another client that tries to present a UI
   for editing a filter value.  In order to help other clients to
   [partially] parse filter values for editing purposes, a client
   storing a filter value SHOULD use () around any SEARCH key not
   defined in [RFC3501] For example, if there is an IMAP extension that
   defines a new x-dsfa SEARCH key that takes 2 parameters, then the
   following SEARCH criteria 'from "@isode.com>" x-dsfa from 5' should
   be stored as 'from "@isode.com>" (x-dsfa from 5)'.

   Note that filter names are restricted to a subset of US-ASCII, as
   described in Section 4.  So they might not always be meaningful to
   users and thus not necessarily suitable for display purposes.  In
   order to help with storing human readable descriptions of filters,
   this document also reserves hierarchy of entries under the "/filter-
   descriptions" root.  The "value" attribute ("value.priv" if present,
   otherwise "value.shared") of a "/filter-descriptions/<filter_name>"
   server annotation is a human readable description for the
   <filter_name> filter, encoded in UTF-8 [UTF-8].  In the absence of
   "/filter-descriptions/<filter_name>" entry the client MAY display the
   name of the filter as its description.

3.2.  FILTER SEARCH criterion

   The FILTER criterion for the SEARCH command allows a client to
   reference a filter stored on the server by name.  A filter called
   "<filter_name>" is stored in the server annotation named "/filters/

   <filter_name>" as described in Section 3.1.

   Syntax: FILTER <filter_name>

   When the named filter exist, its search criteria (i.e. the associated
   "value" attribute) is inserted verbatum instead of the FILTER search-
   key.  For example, the following SEARCH command

   C: a SEARCH UID 300:900 FILTER on-the-road SINCE " 3-Dec-2002"

   would be equivalent to the following

   C: a SEARCH UID 300:900 SMALLER 5000 FROM "boss@example.com"
   SINCE " 3-Dec-2002"

   assuming the filter "on-the-road" is as defined in the example from
   Section 3.1.

   A reference to a non-existent or unaccessible (e.g. due to access
   control restrictions) filter MUST cause failure of the SEARCH command
   with the tagged NO response, that includes the UNDEFINED-FILTER
   response code followed by the name of the non-existent/unaccessible
   filter.

   Note the server SHOULD verify that each search criteria referenced by
   the FILTER search key is a full and correct search criteria.  For
   example, the server should fail the SEARCH command if its SEARCH
   criteria references a filter containing "OR SMALLER" search criteria,
   because this value is not a fully search criteria.

   Note that a named filter itself can reference another filter using
   the FILTER search-key.  Implementations MUST be able to perform at
   least 3 substitution passes on the SEARCH criteria.  If an
   implementation allows for more passes, it MUST implement some kind of
   loop detection.  If an implementation detects a loop or still sees a
   FILTER search-key after performing at least 3 substitutions, it MUST
   behave as if the specified filter doesn't exist (as described above).

   Note that use of the FILTER search key implies the CHARSET "UTF-8"
   parameter to the SEARCH/UID SEARCH command.  If the SEARCH/UID SEARCH
   command includes the explicit CHARSET parameter with the value other
   than "UTF-8" or "US-ASCII" then such command MUST result in the
   tagged BAD response from the server.  Such tagged response MUST
   contain the BADCHARSET response code (see [RFC3501]).

4.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].

   Non-terminals referenced but not defined below are as defined by
   [RFC3501] or [IMAPABNF].

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

   capability         =/ "X-DRAFT-I01-FILTERS"
                         ;; [[Note to RFC Editor: change the capability
                         ;; name before publication]]

   search-criteria       =  search-key *(SP search-key)

   search-key            =/  "FILTER" SP filter-name
                         ;; New SEARCH criterion for referencing filters

   filter-name           =  1*<any ATOM-CHAR except "/">
                         ;; Note that filter-name disallows UTF-8 or
                         ;; the following characters: "(", ")", "{",
                         ;; " ", "%", "*", "]".  See definition of
                         ;; ATOM-CHAR [RFC3501].

   resp-text-code        =/  "UNDEFINED-FILTER" SP filter-name


5.  Security Considerations

   General issues relevant to [RFC3501] (in particular to the SEARCH
   command) and [METADATA] are also relevant to this document.

   Note that excessive use of filters can potentially simplify DoS
   attacks, especially if combined with poor implementations and lack of
   loop detection (i.e. detection of filters referencing each other to
   create a loop).  Servers that allow for anonymous access SHOULD NOT
   allow anonymous users to create/edit/delete filters.

   Also note that stored filters can potentially dislose personal
   information about users.  When confidentiality of such information is
   important, clients SHOULD use TLS and/or SASL security layer (or
   similar) as recommended in [RFC3501].

   As always, it is important to thoroughly test clients and servers

   when implementing this extension.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a standards track or
   IESG approved experimental RFC.  The registry is currently located
   at:

      http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities

   This document defines the X-DRAFT-I01-FILTERS [[anchor9: Note to RFC
   Editor: change before publication to FILTERS]] IMAP capability.  IANA
   is requested to add it to the registry.

   IANA is also requested to add the following 2 entries to the
   [METADATA] registry:
