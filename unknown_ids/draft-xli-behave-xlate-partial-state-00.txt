  Stateless/Partial-state 1:N Network Address and Protocol Translation
                      between IPv4 and IPv6 nodes
                draft-xli-behave-xlate-partial-state-00

Abstract

   This document presents concepts and implementations of stateless/
   partial-state 1:N network address and protocol translation between
   IPv4 and IPv6 nodes.

   Stateless 1:N translation keeps the features of stateless, end-to-end
   address transparency and bidirectional-initiated communications of
   the original stateless translation (1:1 IVI), in addition it can
   utilize the IPv4 addresses more effectively.  However, it requires
   the modification of the IPv6 end systems or deploying home gateways.
   By introducing "partial state" in the translator, this requirement is
   not necessary.

1.  Introduction

   The experiences for the IPv6 deployment in the past 10 years strongly
   indicate that for a successful transition, the communication between
   IPv4 and IPv6 address families should be supported.

   Recently, the stateless and stateful IPv4/IPv6 translation methods
   are developed and becoming the IETF standards
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework], [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate],
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].  The original stateless IPv4/
   IPv6 translation (stateless 1:1 IVI) is scalable, maintains the end-
   to-end address transparency and support both IPv6 initiated and IPv4
   initiated communications [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework],
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate].  But it can not use the IPv4 addresses
   effectively.  The IPv4 address depletion problem makes the deployment
   of the stateless 1:1 IVI difficult.  The stateful IPv4/IPv6
   translation can share the IPv4 addresses among IPv6 hosts, but it
   only supports IPv6 initiated communication
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework],
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].  Rely on session initiated
   states, the stateful translation cannot support the end-to-end
   address transparency and costs more compared with the stateless
   translation.

   We then try to find a translation scheme which keeps end-to-end
   address transparency can utilize IPv4 address effectively.  This
   turns into stateless and partial-state translators.  Stateless 1:N
   translation is an extensions of the stateless translation, which
   keeps stateless, end-to-end address transparency and bidirectional-
   initiated communications.  By limiting useable port range for
   different IPv6 addresses, several IPv6 hosts can share a single IPv4
   address using limited port range.  The partial state 1:N translator
   is an further extensions of the stateless 1:N translation.  It tracks
   and maps port range of IPv6 hosts using a simplified scheme of
   stateful translation.  Therefore, the modification of IPv6 hosts is
   not required.

   The stateless/partial-state 1:N translation are solutions for the
   following scenarios [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework].

   o  Scenario 1: An IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet.

   o  Scenario 2: The IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network.

   o  Scenario 5: An IPv6 network to an IPv4 network.

   o  Scenario 6: An IPv4 network to an IPv6 network.

2.  Terminologies

   This document uses the terminologies defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework],
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful],
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Stateless 1:N Translation

   In order to provide IPv4 connectivity for multiple IPv6 hosts sharing
   a single IPv4 address, the port number multiplexing technique is
   used.  This is to say that a single IPv4 address can be shared for
   multiple IPv6 hosts under the condition that these individual hosts
   can only use a subset of the 65,536 port numbers when communicating
   with the IPv4 Internet.  For example, if the port multiplexing ratio
   is 128, each host with IPv4- translatable address can use 512
   concurrent port numbers when communicating with IPv4 Internet.  Note
   that there is no port number restriction when these IPv6 hosts
   communicate with the IPv6 Internet.

   The stateless 1:N translation is shown in the following figure.

                                              -------|HostK| A1/(P%N)+K

   the same IPv4 address A1, but port number range for different hosts
   are not overlapped.  Therefore, when these IPv6 hosts communicate
   with the IPv4 Internet via the translator, it looks like a single
   host with IPv4 address A1 communicating with the IPv4 Internet.

   We use the Modulus Operator to define the port number range.  If the
   multiplexing ratio is N, then:

   o  For host K, the allowed port number (P) are P=j*N + K (j=0, 1,
      ..., N-1).

   o  For the destination port number (P), the packets will be sent to
      host K=(P%N) (% is the Modulus Operator).

   For example: If N=256, then host K=5 is only allowed to use port
   numbers 5, 261, 517, 773, ..., 65,285 as the source port, while the
   packets with these port numbers as the destination port number will
   be send to host K=5.

3.2.  Extended address format

   In order to perform the stateless translation between the IPv4 and
   IPv6, both IPv4-converted and IPv4-translatable address are required
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework], [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].

   The IPv4-converted addresses are used to represent IPv4 addresses in
   IPv6, as shown in the following figure.

3.3.  Transport address mapping algorithm

   For the stateless 1:N translation, the IPv6 end systems are required
   to follow the port number range defined by the extended IPv4-
   translatable address format when communicating with the IPv4
   Internet.  The port number handling algorithm is:

   o  If the packets are from IPv4 to IPv6, the IPv4 source addresses
      are translated to the IPv4-converted addresses and the source port
      numbers are unchanged; the IPv4 destination addresses are
      translated to the extended IPv4-translatable addresses based on
      the destination port number and the destination port numbers are
      unchanged.

   o  If the packets are from IPv6 to IPv4, the IPv6 source addresses
      and the source port numbers are checked, if the source port number
      matches the port number range defined by the extended IPv4-
      translatable address format, the IPv6 source addresses (which are
      the IPv4-translatable addresses) are translated to the IPv4
      addresses and the source port numbers are unchanged; the
      destination IPv6 addresses (which are the IPv4-converted
      addresses) are translated to the IPv4 destination addresses and
      the destination port numbers are unchanged.  However, if the
      source port numbers do not match the port number range defined by
      the extended IPv4-translatable address format, the packets will be
      dropped.

3.4.  Protocol translation

   The protocol translation is defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate],
   except the address translation, which is defined in sections 3.2 and
   4.2 of this document.

3.5.  IPv6 end system requirements

   The IPv6 end systems MUST follow the port number range defined by the
   extended IPv4-translatable addresses.  The behavior of the IPv6 end
   system when communicating with the IPv4 Internet are:

   o  If the IPv6 end system is used as a server, different well-known
      ports will be served by different IPv6 hosts.

   o  If the IPv6 end system is used as a client, the end system must
      generate the source port numbers in the range defined by the
      extended IPv4-translatable address format.  This can be done by
      the modification of IPv6 end systems.

4.  Partial-state 1:N Translation

   Stateless 1:N translation requires that IPv6 end system generate
   source port number in the range defined by the extended IPv4-
   translatable address.  Then we introduce partial-state 1:N
   translation, which consists of session table and port number mapping
   algorithm in translator without the modification of IPv6 end systems.

4.1.  Session tables

   A partial-state translator has three session tables: one for TCP
   sessions, one for UDP sessions, and one for ICMP Query sessions.  For
   TCP and UDP, the session table contains address and port number.  For
   ICMP Query, the session table contains address and identifier.  Each
   entry in the session tables keeps information on the state of the
   corresponding session.

   o  UDP session is initiated based on port number mapping algorithm
      defined in section 4.2 and a timer that tracks the remaining
      lifetime of the UDP session.  When the timer expires, the UDP
      session is deleted.

   o  TCP Session is based on port number mapping algorithm defined in
      section 4.2 and TCP state machine.  When the state machine reaches
      the termination state, the TCP session is deleted.

   o  ICMP query session is initiated based on port number mapping
      algorithm defined in section 4.2 and a timer that tracks the
      remaining lifetime of the ICMP Query session.  When the timer
      expires, the session is deleted.

4.2.  Port number mapping algorithm

   For source port number of the packet from IPv6 to IPv4:

   o  If source port number is not in the range defined by the extended
      IPv4-translatable address, the translator will check if there is
      an entry in the session table.

      *  If the entry exists, the translator will use that entry to map
         source port to the one in the session table.

      *  If the entry does not exist, the translator will create an
         entry in the session table to map the source port to an allowed
         range.

   o  If source port number is in the range defined by the extended
      IPv4-translatable address, the translator will not create an entry
      in the session table.

   For destination port number of the packet from IPv4 to IPv6:

   o  If the mapping entry exists in the session table, map the
      destination port number to the one in the session table.

   o  If the mapping entry does not exist in the session table, keep the
      original destination port number.

   For destination port number of the packet from IPv6 to IPv4 and for
   source port number of the packets from IPv4 to IPv6, no special
   algorithm is required and there is no port number change.

   The reason we call this partial-state is that:

   1.  The address mapping is fully algorithm based, as defined in
       section 3.3.  The states are used for port number mapping only,
       as defined in section 4.2.

   2.  There will be no session table created if the the source port
       number from IPv6 to IPv4 is in the range defined by the extended
       IPv4-translatable address.

   3.  For the destination port number of the packet from the IPv4 to
       IPv6, there will be no session table created


5.  Operation considerations

5.1.  Routing

   The routing follows the general IPv4/IPv6 routing principle, i.e.
   "more specifics win", same as the original stateless 1:1 IVI.
   [I-D.xli-behave-ivi].

5.2.  DNS

   The DNS handling is referring to DNS64 [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] and
   DNS46 [I-D.xli-behave-dns46-for-stateless].

5.3.  ALG

   The ALG related issue is discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework].

6.  Deployment Considerations

   The stateless 1:N translation requires that the IPv6 hosts served by
   the translator generate the port numbers in the range defined
   extended IPv4-translatable addresses.

6.1.  Using Modified IPv6 Hosts in an IPv6 Network

   Stateless translation can be deployed using modified IPv6 hosts.
   These IPv6 hosts are using extended IPv4-translatable addresses and
   the IPv6 hosts will generate the source port number in the range
   defined by extended IPv4-translatable addresses.  In other words, the
   end systems maintain the port-number mapping states.

6.2.  Using Unmodified IPv6 Hosts in an IPv6 Network

   Partial-state translation can be deployed using unmodified IPv6
   hosts.  These IPv6 hosts are using extended IPv4-translatable
   addresses and translator (XLATE) keeps the states for the port-number
   mapping.

6.3.  Mixed Environment in an IPv6 Network

   In a mixed environment, partial-state translator can be deployed.  If
   the IPv6 packets contain the port numbers which are not in the range
   defined by extended IPv4-translatable addresses, the states will be
   created in the translator.  Otherwise, no states created and
   maintained in the translator.


7.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations in this document.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo adds no new IANA considerations.

   Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
   correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are
   required, or if those assignments or registries are created during
   the RFC publication process.  From the author's perspective, it may
   therefore be removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor's
   discretion.
