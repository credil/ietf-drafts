                draft-baker-v6ops-session-start-time-00

Abstract

   A barrier to the deployment of IPv6 is the amount of time it takes to
   open a session using common transport APIs.  This note addresses
   issues and requests solutions that may respond to them.

Internet-Draft            It takes too long...              October 2010


1.  Introduction

   One of the issues in IPv6 deployment is the time, from a user's
   perspective, that it takes to open a standard application, which is
   to say the time it takes to open a TCP session that the application
   can use to accomplish its mission.

   One thing to understand is that each source/destination pair of
   addresses (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, including link-local,
   organizational scope such as [RFC1918] or ULA [RFC4193], and global
   addresses) defines a path between those interfaces.  The path may or
   may not actually work (the two addresses may not be in the same
   domain or the same scope, or routing may not be defined, or
   forwarding may be filtered), and even if the network workds, the peer
   may or may not be willing to respond to any given address.  Hence, in
   the worst case, every pair of addresses may need to be tried in the
   process of finding a pair that enables communication.

   In the immortal words of [RFC1958],

      The current exponential growth of the network seems to show that
      connectivity is its own reward, and is more valuable than any
      individual application such as mail or the World-Wide Web. This
      connectivity requires technical cooperation between service
      providers, and flourishes in the increasingly liberal and
      competitive commercial telecommunications environment.

   An application or API that fails to quickly enable connectivity
   between any two systems that are authorized to communication. has
   fundamentally missed the point, and can expect its customers to
   migrate to solutions that don't miss the point.

   Part of the issue has to do with source address choice in multihomed
   networks, as described in [I-D.troan-multihoming-without-nat66]; if
   the host selects the wrong source address for a session with a peer,
   BCP 38 [RFC2827] ingress filtering will prevent its delivery.  Any
   delay in selecting an alternative source address will irritate the
   user, making IPv6 appear less desirable.

   Part of it has to do with the standard response of TCP and SCTP
   clients to RST and ICMP Unreachable messages; if another address pair
   exists, any delay in selecting an alternative source address will
   irritate the user, making IPv6 appear less desirable.

   Part of it has to do with the rate of session attempts; if one takes
   multiple seconds per attempt and, present implementations require as
   much as 40 seconds to open a basic web page.  Again, such delays
   irritate the user, making IPv6 appear less desirable.

2.  Possible Solutions

   TCP's standard reaction to soft errors, which includes its response
   to an abrupt RST from the peer and its response to ICMP "unreachable
   messages", doesn't help.  [RFC5461] makes pragmatic suggestions to
   address the issues.  From an operator's perspective, it is felt that
   the fundamental suggestion is a good one, and either should be
   standardized and widely deployed or a better suggestion should be
   standardized and widely deployed.

   The Happy Eyeballs [I-D.wing-http-new-tech] draft addresses the
   startup question.  From an operator's perspective, it is felt that
   the fundamental suggestion is a good one, and either should be
   standardized and widely deployed or a better suggestion should be
   standardized and widely deployed.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo asks the IANA for no new parameters.

   Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
   correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are
   required, or if those assignments or registries are created during
   the RFC publication process.  From the author"s perspective, it may
   therefore be removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor"s
   discretion.


4.  Security Considerations

   This note doesn't address security-related issues.


5.  Acknowledgements

   This note was discussed with Joel Jaeggli, Dan Wing, and Fernando
   Gont.
