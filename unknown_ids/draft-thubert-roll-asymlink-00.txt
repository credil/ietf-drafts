                 RPL adaptation for asymmetrical links
                     draft-thubert-roll-asymlink-00

Abstract

   The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks defines a
   generic Distance Vector protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks,
   many of which exhibit strongly asymmetrical characteristics.  This
   draft proposes an extension for that optimizes RPL operations whereby
   upwards and downwards direction-optimized RPL instances are
   associated.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF ROLL Working Group has defined application-specific routing
   requirements for a Low Power and Lossy Network (LLN) routing
   protocol, specified in [RFC5548], [RFC5673], [RFC5826], and
   [RFC5867], many of which explicitly or implicitly refer to links with
   asymmetrical properties.

   Upon those requirements, the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy
   Network [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] was designed as a platform that can be
   extended by further specifications or guidances, by adding new
   metrics, Objective Functions, or additional options.

   RPL forms Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs)
   within instances of the protocol.  Each instance is associated with
   an Objective Function that is designed to solve the problem that is
   addressed by that instance.

   In one hand, RPL requires bidirectional links for the control, but on
   the other, there is no requirement that the properties of a link are
   the same in both directions.  In fact, such a symmetry is rarely
   present in LLNs, whether links are based on radios or power-line.

   Some initial implementations require that the quality of both
   directions of a link is evaluated as very good so that the link can
   be used for control and data in both directions.  This eliminates
   asymmetrical links that are very good in one direction, but only good
   enough for scarce activity in the other direction.

   In practice, a DAG that is built to optimize upwards traffic is
   generally not congruent with a DAG that is built to optimize
   downwards traffic.  This is why this specification is designed to
   enable asymmetrical routing DAGs that are bound together to get the
   maximum benefits of all bidirectional links.


2.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document is consistent with and
   incorporates that described in `Terminology in Low power And Lossy
   Networks' [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology] and [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].

   The term upwards qualifies a link, a DODAG or an instance that is
   optimal for sending traffic in the general direction of the root,
   though may be usable but suboptimal for traffic coming form the
   direction of the root.  The term downwards qualifies the same words
   for the opposite direction.

   The term parenting applied to instances refers to the directional
   association of two instances.  The graph formed by parented instances
   must be a DAG.  Traffic may be transferred from an instance onto a
   parent instance under specified circumstances.


3.  The asymmetrical link problem


4.  Solution Overview

   With the core RPL specification, [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] each instance is
   a separate routing topology, and packets must be forwarded within the
   same topology / same instance.  One direct consequence of that design
   choice is that a topology must be very good for both upwards and
   downwards traffic; otherwise, traffic between two nodes in the
   instance may suffer.

   A simple approach to address bidirectional but asymmetrical links
   with RPL is to construct two DAGs, one for upwards traffic and one
   for downwards traffic, each DAG a separate instance, and then bind
   the two together.  In order to benefit from both instances for a same
   packet, this solution extends RPL to allow traffic to be transferred
   from one instance to the next.

   It can be noted at this point that with [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl], traffic
   that goes down does not generally go back up again, whereas P2P
   traffic within a DODAG might go up to a common parent and then down
   to the destination.  In terms of instance relationship, this means
   that when an upwards and a downwards instance are bound together,
   traffic from the former may be transferred to the latter, but not the
   other way around.  In other words, there is an order, a parent-child
   relationship, between the two instances.

   Additionally, if there is no next-hop for a packet going down within
   the instance, then with [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] the packet must be
   dropped.  In order to limit that risk, it is tempting though
   inefficient to lower the constraints that are applied to build the
   topology.  It can be more efficient to actually keep the constraints
   as they should be, but, instead, enable a less constrained, more
   spanning, fall-back topology into which traffic can be transferred.

   For that reason, this solution allows for more complex instance
   relationships than plain child-parent associations.  In order to
   avoids loops which could be created when transferring packets from
   one instance to the next, this solution requires that the instances
   be themselves organized as a superior Directed Acyclic Graph, and
   enforce that inter-DAG transfers occur only within that superior

   super-DAG of DAG instances.


5.  Modified DODAG Information Object (DIO)

   The DODAG Information Object [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] carries information
   that allows a node to discover a RPL Instance, learn its
   configuration parameters, select a DODAG parent set, and maintain the
   DODAG.  This specification defines a new flag bit to indicate that
   the DAG is directional.

   Directional (D):  The Directional (D) flag is set to indicate that
         the instance is intended for directional operation, and reset
         otherwise.  When it is set, a MOP of 0 indicates the upwards
         direction whereas any other value specified in
         [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl] indicates downwards.  All other values of
         MOP will be considered downwards unless explicitly specified
         otherwise.


6.  Operations

   This specification allows an organization of Instances as follows:

      Instances MUST be organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph.  This
      information MUST be commissioned into the devices so they know
      both which instances they should participate in, and which

Internet-Draft         draft-thubert-roll-asymlink          October 2011


      direction of transfer is allowed between instances.

      A spanning instance using OF0 [I-D.ietf-roll-of0] MAY be used as
      root in that instance DAG.

   This specification defines a new bit in the RPL [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl]
   DODAG Information Object (DIO) with the Directional (D) flag that
   indicates a directional operation for a given instance.  An
   implementation that does not support that new bit will not be able to
   propagate it.

   In case of a directional operation,

      The direction is indicated by the MOP field, a MOP of 0 means
      upwards and otherwise is downwards.

      Links are still REQUIRED to allow bidirectional operations

      Only the metrics that correspond to the DAG direction are used for
      the parent selection.

      An upward instance SHOULD install routes that lead to the root and
      beyond - typically the default route.

      A downwards instance MAY ONLY install more specific routes that
      are injected by nodes in the DODAG through the DAO process.

      P2P operations are achieved by associating a child upwards
      instance with a parent downwards instance.

      A packet MUST NOT be transferred from a parent instance to a child
      instance.

      A packet MAY be transferred from a child instance to its parent
      instance if and only if the child instance does not provide a
      route to the destination, or the parent instance provides a more
      specific route (longer match) to the destination.

      Transferring from an upwards instance to a downwards instance if
      generally desirable.  Other forms of transfers are generally not
      desirable.  Policies MAY be put in place to ovreride that general
      guidance.


7.  Backward compatibility

   An OF is generally designed to compute a Rank of a directional link
   in a fashion that is diffent from a bidirectional link, and in



Thubert                  Expires April 19, 2012                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         draft-thubert-roll-asymlink          October 2011


   particular will not use the same metrics and thusobtain different
   ranks for a same situation.  For that reason, it is important that
   the OF is aware that an instance is supposed to define a directional
   DODAG, and it is RECOMMENDED that only devices that support
   directional DODAGs are allowed in a directional instance.

   It might happen that for some purposes like higher availability, an
   implementation that does not support directional links is
   administratively allowed to join a directional DODAG.  In that case,
   the extension of the DODAG that starts at that device will not be
   directional, but the instance will still be functional.

   In that case, it might also happen that a device that supports
   directional DODAGs per this specification sees candidate neighbors
   that expose the Directional flag and some others that do not.  An OF
   that supports directional links SHOULD favor directional links over
   non directional links, in a fashion that is to be specified with the
   OF.  In the case of OF0 [I-D.ietf-roll-of0], the 'D' flag should be
   accounted for before the computation of item 8 in the "Selection Of
   The Preferred Parent" section 4.2.1., that is before Ranks and be
   calculated and compared.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requires that a bit in DIO be assigned to indicate
   directional link operations as specified in section


9.  Security Considerations

   Security Considerations for this proposal are to be developed in
   accordance with recommendations laid out in, for example,
   [I-D.tsao-roll-security-framework].
