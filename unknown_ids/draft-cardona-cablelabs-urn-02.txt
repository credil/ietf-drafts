Internet-Draft         URN Namespace for CableLabs             July 2009


1.  Introduction

   CableLabs is a non-profit research and development consortium that is
   dedicated to pursuing new cable telecommunications technologies and
   to helping its cable operator members integrate those technical
   advancements into their business objectives.  Within CableLabs,
   specification activities are organized into projects such as
   DOCSIS(R), PacketCable(TM), and OpenCable(TM), and technical work is
   conducted within focus teams.  Product vendors, manufacturers, and
   cable operator members are invited to join the focus teams that
   create technical specifications.

   Occasionally, CableLabs specifications efforts require URN namespaces
   that are managed so that they are unique and persistent.  To ensure
   that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of specific NID for
   use by CableLabs is being specified in this document, in full
   conformance with the NID registration process specified in [RFC3406].


2.  URN Specification for CableLabs

   Namespace ID:

        cablelabs

   Registration Information:

        registration version number: 1
        registration date: YYYY-MM-DD [RFC Editor: Please replace YYYY-
        MM-DD with the publication date of this RFC.]

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

        Registering organization

           Name: Cable Television Laboratories, Inc.
           Address: 858 Coal Creek Circle, Louisville, CO 80027, USA

        Designated contact

           Role: Manager, Standards

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

        The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the
        "cablelabs" NID will have the following structure:
        urn:cablelabs:{CLresource}:{CLResourceSpecificString} where the

Internet-Draft         URN Namespace for CableLabs             July 2009


        "CLresource" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN
        syntax requirements specified in [RFC2141] and defines a
        specific class of resource type.  Each resource type will have a
        specific labeling scheme that is covered by
        "CLResourceSpecificString", which also conforms to the naming
        requirements of [RFC2141].

        CableLabs maintains the CableLabs Assigned Names and Numbers
        [CANN] specification that will contain the assignment of
        "CLresources" and the specific registration values assigned for
        each resource class.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

        CableLabs publishes information regarding the registered
        resources in the CableLabs' Assigned Names and Numbers
        specification (ref: [CANN]).

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

        CableLabs will manage resources using the "cablelabs" NID and
        will be the authority for managing the resources and subsequent
        strings associated.  CableLabs is expected to guarantee the
        uniqueness of the strings themselves or it may permit secondary
        responsibility for certain defined resources.

        CableLabs could allow the use of experimental type values for
        testing purposes only.  Note that using experimental types may
        create collisions as multiple users may use the same values for
        resources and specific strings.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

        CableLabs will update the CableLabs' Assigned Names and Numbers
        specification (ref: [CANN]) to document the registered resources
        that use the "cablelabs" NID.

   Process of identifier assignment:

        CableLabs will provide procedures for registration of each type
        of resource that it maintains.  Each such resource may have
        three types of registration activities:

           1.  Registered values associated with CableLabs documents or
           services
           2.  Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities
           3.  Name models for use in experimental purposes

Internet-Draft         URN Namespace for CableLabs             July 2009


   Process for identifier resolution:

        The namespace is not listed with a resolution discovery system;
        this is not applicable for this URN registration.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

        No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
        [RFC2141] apply.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

        No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

        None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
        implemented in support of CableLabs activities.

   Scope:

        Global


3.  Example

   The following example represents a hypothetical URN that could be
   assigned by CableLabs.

   urn:cablelabs:packetcable-example:ue:rst-sample

   Defines the URN to be used for User Equipment (UE) conforming to the
   sample Residential SIP Telephony (RST) application specified within
   CableLabs' PacketCable RST specification suite.


4.  Namespace Considerations

   CableLabs develops specifications that may require the use of data
   models.  URN Namespaces are key constructs to manage the definitions
   of those data models reliably with persistence and uniqueness.

   The use of URNs should also help specification authors to maintain
   different versions of URNs and dependencies between urns, across
   different versions of CableLabs specifications, if they so wish.

Internet-Draft         URN Namespace for CableLabs             July 2009


5.  Community Considerations

   The CableLabs specifications are publicly available or licensed to
   manufacturers on a nondiscriminatory basis.  CableLabs will maintain
   the allocation of resources for the "cablelabs" NID and maintain
   updated the corresponding specifications where those resources are
   referenced or used.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds a new entry in the urn-namespaces registry.  The
   namespace should be "cablelabs".  This is the defining document.  The
   entry can be found at: http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces
   and any associated mirrors.


7.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.
