  DNS Security (DNSSEC) DNSKEY IANA Registry Algorithm Status Addition
               draft-ietf-dnsext-dnssec-registry-fixes-05

Abstract

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) has an IANA registry to allocate
   cryptographic algorithm suites for use in generating digital
   signatures over DNS data.  Newly introduced cryptographic algorithms
   to DNSSEC mean implementors need to know which algorithms need to be
   implemented, which are optional, and which are obsolete.  This
   document adds a column to the IANA registry table for Domain Name
   System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers which lists their current
   status for use.

Internet-Draft             IANA Registry Fixes                 June 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], and [RFC4035] uses digital signatures over DNS data to
   provide source authentication and integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses
   an IANA registry to allocate codes for digital signature algorithms
   (consisting of a cryptographic algorithm and one-way hash function).

   The original list of algorithm status is found in [RFC4034].  Other
   DNSSEC documents have added new algorithms or changed the status of
   algorithms in the registry.  However, implementors must read through
   all the documents in order to discover which algorithms are mandatory
   to implement and which are optional or no longer used.

   This document requests a column to be added to the IANA registry for
   Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers.  This column
   will list the current status of each digital signature algorithm in
   the registry at the time of writing and assigns status for algorithms
   used with DNSSEC that did not have a status when they were originally
   specified.  This document updates the following: [RFC2536],
   [RFC2539], [RFC3110], [RFC4034], [RFC4398], [RFC5155], [RFC5702], and
   [RFCTBD].

1.1.  Terms Used in this Document to Indicate Status

   The following terms are used within this document to indicate the
   current implementation status of the given digital signature
   algorithm as of the time of writing.  Here, "implementation" refers
   to any component (e.g. validator, signer, etc.) that conforms to this
   document.  Some of these terms were used without definition in
   previous documents and are defined here.

      MANDATORY: Implementations MUST support this algorithm to be
      considered currently inter-operable.

      OPTIONAL: Implementation MAY support this algorithm.  The presence
      or lack thereof this algorithm MUST NOT be used to judge
      conformance to this document.

      ENCOURAGED: Implementations SHOULD support this algorithm, but
      like DISCRETIONARY, lack of support MUST NOT be used to judge
      conformance to this document.  This term is also used to hint of a
      possible status change in the future to MANDATORY.

      OBSOLETE: New implementations SHOULD NOT support this algorithm.

   These words are also defined in
   [I-D.ogud-iana-protocol-maintenance-words], but the definitions above

   are used for this document.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  DNS Security Algorithm Number Subregistry Fixes

   The DNS Security Algorithm Number subregistry (part of the Domain
   Name System (DNS) Security Number registry) will be modified to
   include a new column.  This column will contain the current
   implementation requirements of the given algorithm.  This document
   does not make any changes to any other column in the registry table.

   There are additional fixes to entries that are described in sub-
   section 2.1.  The overall new registry table is in sub-section 2.2.
   The values for the status were obtained from [RFC4034] with updates
   for algorithms specified after the original DNSSEC specification.
   The status of algorithms marked OPTIONAL in [RFC4034] are changed to
   DISCRETIONARY as defined in
   [I-D.ogud-iana-protocol-maintenance-words].  The status of algorithms
   marked NOT RECOMMENDED in [RFC4034] are changed to OBSOLETE as
   defined in [I-D.ogud-iana-protocol-maintenance-words].

2.1.  Individual Fixes

   This document changes three entries in the Domain Name System
   Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Registry.  They are:

   The description for assignment number 4 is changed to "Reserved until
   2020".

   The description for assignment number 9 is changed to "Reserved until
   2020".

   The description for assignment number 11 is changed to "Reserved
   until 2020".

   Registry entries 13-251 remains Unassigned.

   The status of RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 and DSA-NSEC3-SHA1 are both set to
   DISCRETIONARY.  The status of RSA/SHA-256 and RSA/SHA-512 are set to
   ENCOURAGED as it is believed that these algorithms will replace older
   algorithms (e.g.  RSA/SHA-1) that have a perceived weakness in their
   hash algorithm (SHA-1).

2.2.  Updated Registry Snapshot

   would look like the following:

2.3.  Specifying New Algorithms and Updating Status of Existing Entries

   [I-D.ietf-dnsext-dnssec-alg-allocation] establishes a parallel
   procedure for obtaining an algorithm number for new algorithms other
   than a standards track document.  Algorithms entered into the
   registry using that procedure are always OPTIONAL.

   Adding a newly specified algorithm to the registry with any status
   other than OPTIONAL SHALL entail an update of this document in order
   to specify new content to the registry.

   Altering the status of any existing algorithm in the registry SHALL
   entail an update to this document in order to change the contents of
   the registry.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document seeks to add a column (titled "Status") to the Domain
   Name System (DNS) Security Algorithm Numbers registry to indicate
   each algorithm's status for implementations seeking to conform to
   this document.  The new table is in Section 2.2 and includes the
   additional following changes detailed in Section 2.1:

   The description of assignment 4 is changed from "Reserved for ECC" to
   "Reserved until 2020".

   The description of assignment 9 is changed from "Unassigned" to
   "Reserved until 2020".

   The description for assignment number 11 is changed from "Unassigned"
   to "Reserved until 2020".

   Registry entries 13-251 remains Unassigned.

   The references for current algorithms in the table in Section 2.2
   have been updated to remove obsolete RFC's and replaced with the
   current reference.

   The references to FIPS 180 and FIPS 186 have been updated (to FIPS
   180-3 and FIPS 186-3 respectively) to reflect the latest versions.
   These revisions are maintenance updates and the relevant content of
   the FIPS documents have not changed.

   This draft updates the references of the entries that have an
   assigned status, in the table in Section 2.2, the text '(this memo)'
   should be replaced with the final RFC when published.

   The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Algorithm Number registry is

4.  Security Considerations

   This document seeks to add a status column to an existing IANA
   registry.  It is not meant to be a discussion on algorithm
   superiority.  No new security considerations are raised in this
   document.
