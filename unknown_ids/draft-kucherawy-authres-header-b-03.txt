                         Cryptographic Results
                  draft-kucherawy-authres-header-b-03

Abstract

   This memo updates the registry of properties in Authentication-
   Results: message header fields to allow a multiple-result report to
   distinguish among one or more cryptographic signatures on a message,
   thus associating specific results with the signatures they represent.

Internet-Draft     Auth-Results header.b Registration          June 2010


1.  Introduction

   [AUTHRES] defined a new header field for electronic mail messages
   that presents the results of a message authentication effort in a
   machine-readable format.  Absent from that specification was the
   means by which the results of two cryptographic signatures, such as
   those provided by [DKIM], can both have results reported in an
   unambiguous manner.

   Fortunately, [AUTHRES] created IANA registries of reporting
   properties, enabling an easy remedy for this problem.  This memo thus
   registers an additional reporting property allowing a result to be
   associated with a specific digital signature.

2.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

3.  Discussion

   A message can contain multiple signatures of a common sender
   authentication mechanism, such as [DKIM].  By applying supported
   "ptype.property" combinations (cf. the ABNF in [AUTHRES]), a result
   can be associated with a given signature provided the signatures are
   all unique within one of the registered values (e.g. all of them had
   unique "header.d" or "header.i" values).  This is not guaranteed,
   however; a single signing agent might have practical reasons for
   affixing multiple signatures with the same "d=" values while varying
   other signature parameters.  This means one could get a "dkim=pass"
   and "dkim=fail" result simultaneously on verification which is
   clearly ambiguous.

   It is thus necessary either to create or to identify a signature
   attribute guaranteed to be unique, such that it is possible to
   unambiguously associate a result with the signature to which it
   refers.

   It is known that SHA1 and SHA256 hash spaces are resilient to
   collisions, and further that RSA key signing mechanisms are similarly
   resilient to common substrings.  Thus, the actual digital signature
   for a cryptographic signing of the message is an ideal property for
   such a unique identification.  It is not however necessary to include
   the entire digital signature in an [AUTHRES] header field just to
   identify which result goes with signature; since the signatures will
   almost always be substantially different, it is anticipated that only
   the first several bytes of a signature will be needed for

   disambiguating results.

4.  Definition

   This memo adds to the "Email Authentication Method Name Registry",
   created by IANA upon publication of [AUTHRES], the "header.b"
   reporting item.  The value associated with this item in the header
   field MUST be at least the first eight characters of the digital
   signature (the "b=" tag from a DKIM-Signature) for which a result is
   being relayed, and MUST be long enough to be unique among the results
   being reported.  Where the total length of the digital signature is
   fewer than eight characters, the entire signature MUST be included.
   Matching of the value of this item against the signature itself MUST
   be case-sensitive.

   If an evaluating agent observes that, despite the use of this
   disambiguating tag, unequal authentication results are offered about
   the same signature from the same trusted authserv-id, that agent
   SHOULD ignore all such results.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Per [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS], the following item is added to the "Email
   Authentication Method Name Registry":

   +------------+----------+--------+----------------+-----------------+
   |   Method   | Defined  | ptype  | property       | value           |
   +------------+----------+--------+----------------+-----------------+
   |    dkim    | RFC4871  | header | b              | full or partial |
   |            |          |        |                | value of        |
   |            |          |        |                | signature "b"   |
   |            |          |        |                | tag             |
   +------------+----------+--------+----------------+-----------------+

6.  Security Considerations

   [AUTHRES] discussed general security considerations regarding the use
   of this header field.  The following new security considerations
   apply when adding or processing this new ptype/property combination:

6.1.  Improvement

   Rather than introducing a new security issue, this can be seen to fix
   a security weakness of the original specification: Useful information
   can now be obtained from results that could previously have been
   ambiguous and thus obscured or, worse, misinterpreted.

Internet-Draft     Auth-Results header.b Registration          June 2010


6.2.  Result Forgeries

   An attacker could copy a valid signature and add it to a message in
   transit, modifying some portion of it.  This could cause two results
   to be provided for the same "header.b" value even if the entire "b="
   string is used in an attempt to differentiate the results.  This
   attack could cause an ambiguous result to be relayed and possibly
   neutralize any benefit given to a "pass" result that would have
   otherwise occurred, possibly impacting the delivery of valid
   messages.

   It is worth noting, however, that a false negative ("fail") can be
   generated in this way, but it is extremely difficult to create a
   false positive ("pass") through such an attack.  Thus, a cautious
   implementation could discard the false negative in that instance.

6.3.  New Schemes with Small Signatures

   Should a new signing scheme be introduced with a signature whose
   length is less than eight characters, Section 4 specifies that the
   entire signature must be used.  The obvious concern in such a case
   would be that the signature scheme is itself prone to collisions,
   making the the value reported by this field not useful.  In such
   cases, the risk is created by the likelihood of collisions and not by
   this mechanism; furthermore, Section 4 recommends the results be
   ignored if that were to occur, preventing the application of an
   ambiguous result.

   Here we see an example of a message that was signed twice at by the
   author's ADMD.  One signature used "relaxed" header canonicalization
   and the other used "simple" header canonicalization; both used
   "simple" body canonicalization.

   Presumably due to a change in one of the five header fields covered
   by the two signatures, the former signature failed to verify while
   the latter passed.  In particular, the "relaxed" header
   canonicalization of [DKIM] is resilient to changes in whitespace in
   the header while "simple" is not, and the latter is the one that
   failed in this example.

   The item registered by this memo allows an evaluation module to
   determine which DKIM result goes with which signature.
