1.  Overview

   This document defines a number of transport methods that are used to
   move CMC messages (defined in [CMC-STRUCT]).  The transport
   mechanisms described in this document are: HTTP, file, mail and TCP.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [MUST].


2.  File based protocol

   Enrollment messages and responses may be transferred between clients
   and servers using file system-based mechanisms, such as when
   enrollment is performed for an off-line client.  When files are used
   to transport binary, Full PKI Request or Full PKI Response messages,
   there MUST be only one instance of a request or response message in a
   single file.  The following file type extensions SHOULD be used:

                 +---------------------+----------------+
                 | Message Type        | File Extension |
                 +---------------------+----------------+
                 | Simple PKI Request  | .p10           |
                 | Full PKI Request    | .crq           |
                 | Simple PKI Response | .p7c           |
                 | Full PKI Response   | .crp           |
                 +---------------------+----------------+

                 File PKI Request/Response Identification


3.  Mail based protocol

   MIME wrapping is defined for those environments that are MIME native.
   The basic mime wrapping in this section is taken from [SMIMEV3].
   When using a mail based protocol, MIME wrapping between the layers of
   CMS wrapping is optional.  Note that is different from the standard
   S/MIME (Secure MIME) message.

   Simple enrollment requests are encoded using the "application/pkcs10"
   content type.  A file name MUST be included either in a content type
   or a content disposition statement.  The extension for the file MUST
   be ".p10".

   Simple enrollment response messages MUST be encoded as content-type
   "application/pkcs7-mime".  An smime-type parameter MUST be on the
   content-type statement with a value of "certs-only."  A file name

   with the ".p7c" extension MUST be specified as part of the content-
   type or content-disposition statement.

   Full enrollment request messages MUST be encoded as content-type
   "application/pkcs7-mime".  The smime-type parameter MUST be included
   with a value of "CMC-enroll".  A file name with the ".p7m" extension
   MUST be specified as part of the content-type or content-disposition
   statement.

   Full enrollment response messages MUST be encoded as content-type
   "application/pkcs7-mime".  The smime-type parameter MUST be included
   with a value of "CMC-response."  A file name with the ".p7m"
   extensions MUST be specified as part of the content-type or content-
   disposition statement.

4.  HTTP/HTTPS based protocol

   This section describes the conventions for use of HTTP [HTTP] as a
   transport layer.  In most circumstances, the use of HTTP over TLS
   [TLS] provides any necessary content protection from ease-droppers.

   In order for CMC clients and servers using HTTP to interoperate, the
   following rules apply.
      Clients MUST use the POST method to submit their requests.
      Servers MUST use the 200 response code for successful reponses.
      Clients MAY attempt to send HTTP requests using TLS 1.0 [TLS] or
      later, although servers are not required to support TLS.
      Servers MUST NOT assume client support for any type of HTTP
      authentication such as cookies, Basic authentication or Digest
      authentication.

Internet-Draft          CMC: Transport Protocols           December 2007


      Clients and servers are expected to follow the other rules and
      restrictions in [HTTP].  Note that some of those rules are for
      HTTP methods other than POST; clearly, only the rules that apply
      to POST are relevant for this specification.

4.1.  PKI Request

   A PKI Request using the POST method is constructed as follows:

   The Content-Type header MUST have the appropriate value from Table 2.

   The body of the message is the binary value of the encoding of the
   PKI Request.

4.2.  PKI Response

   An HTTP-based PKI Response is composed of the appropriate HTTP
   headers, followed by the binary value of the BER (Basic Encoding
   Rules) encoding of either a Simple or Full PKI Response.

   The Content-Type header MUST have the appropriate value from Table 2.


5.  TCP based protocol

   When CMC messages are sent over a TCP-Based connection, no wrapping
   is required of the message.  Messages are sent in their binary
   encoded form.

   The connection is closed by the server after generating a response
   for the client.  (All CMC request messages from client to server
   generate a response message.)  If a second set of messages from the
   client to the server is required to complete the transaction, the
   client generates a new TCP-Based connection for this purpose; it
   cannot reuse an existing one.

   Out of band setup can be used to keep a TCP-Based connection open for
   more than one message pair.  A situation where this can occur is an
   RA talking to a CA over a specially setup TCP connection.

   There is no specific port that is to be used when doing TCP based
   transport.  This is to be configured out of band.


6.   Socket-Based Transport

   When enrollment messages and responses are sent over sockets, no
   wrapping is required.  Messages MUST be sent in their binary, BER-

   encoded form.


7.   Security Considerations

   Mechanisms for thwarting replay attacks may be required in particular
   implementations of this protocol depending on the operational
   environment.  In cases where the CA maintains significant state
   information, replay attacks may be detectable without the inclusion
   of the optional nonce mechanisms.  Implementers of this protocol need
   to carefully consider environmental conditions before choosing
   whether or not to implement the senderNonce and recipientNonce
   attributes described in section 5.6 of [CMC-STRUCT].  Developers of
   state-constrained PKI clients are strongly encouraged to incorporate
   the use of these attributes.


8.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations in this document.
