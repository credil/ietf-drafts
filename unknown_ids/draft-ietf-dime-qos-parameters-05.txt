Internet-Draft               QoS Parameters                     May 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a number of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters
   that can be reused for conveying QoS information within RADIUS and
   Diameter.

   The subsequent section give an overview of the parameters defined by
   this document.

1.1.  Traffic Model Parameter

   The Traffic Model (TMOD) parameter is a container consisting of four
   sub-parameters:
   o  rate (r)
   o  bucket size (b)
   o  peak rate (p)
   o  minimum policed unit (m)

   The TMOD parameter is a mathematically complete way to describe the
   traffic source.  If, for example, TMOD is set to specify bandwidth
   only, then set r = peak rate = p, b = large, m = large.  As another
   example if TMOD is set for TCP traffic, then set r = average rate, b
   = large, p = large.

1.2.  Constraints Parameters

   <Path Latency>, <Path Jitter>, <Path PLR>, and <Path PER> are QoS
   parameters describing the desired path latency, path jitter and path
   bit error rate respectively.

   The <Path Latency> parameter refers to the accumulated latency of the
   packet forwarding process associated with each QoS aware node along
   the path, where the latency is defined to be the mean packet delay
   added by each such node.  This delay results from speed-of-light
   propagation delay, from packet processing limitations, or both.  The
   mean delay reflects the variable queuing delay that may be present.
   The purpose of this parameter is to provide a minimum path latency
   for use with services which provide estimates or bounds on additional
   path delay [RFC2212].

   The <Path Jitter> parameter refers to the accumulated jitter of the
   packet forwarding process associated with each QoS aware node along
   the path, where the jitter is defined to be the nominal jitter added
   by each such node.  IP packet jitter, or delay variation, is defined
   in Section 3.4 of RFC 3393 [RFC3393], (Type-P-One-way-ipdv), and
   where the selection function includes the packet with minimum delay
   such that the distribution is equivalent to 2-point delay variation
   in [Y.1540].  The suggested evaluation interval is 1 minute.  This

Internet-Draft               QoS Parameters                     May 2008


   jitter results from packet processing limitations, and includes any
   variable queuing delay which may be present.  The purpose of this
   parameter is to provide a nominal path jitter for use with services
   that provide estimates or bounds on additional path delay [RFC2212].

   The procedures for collecting path jitter information are outside the
   scope of this document.

   The <Path PLR> parameter refers to the accumulated packet loss rate
   (PLR) of the packet forwarding process associated with each QoS aware
   node along the path where the PLR is defined to be the PLR added by
   each such node.

   The <Path PER> parameter refers to the accumulated packet error rate
   (PER) of the packet forwarding process associated with each QoS aware
   node, where the PER is defined to be the PER added by each such node.

   The <Slack Term> parameter refers to the difference between desired
   delay and delay obtained by using bandwidth reservation, and which is
   used to reduce the resource reservation for a flow [RFC2212].

   The <Preemption Priority> parameter refers to the priority of the new
   flow compared with the <Defending Priority> of previously admitted
   flows.  Once a flow is admitted, the preemption priority becomes
   irrelevant.  The <Defending Priority> parameter is used to compare
   with the preemption priority of new flows.  For any specific flow,
   its preemption priority MUST always be less than or equal to the
   defending priority. <Admission Priority> and <RPH Priority> provide
   an essential way to differentiate flows for emergency services, ETS,
   E911, etc., and assign them a higher admission priority than normal
   priority flows and best-effort priority flows.

1.3.  Traffic Handling Directives

   The <Excess Treatment< parameter describes how a QoS aware node will
   process excess traffic, that is, out-of-profile traffic.  Excess
   traffic MAY be dropped, shaped and/or remarked.

1.4.  Traffic Classes

   Resource reservations might refer to a packet processing with a
   particular DiffServ per-hop behavior (PHB) [RFC2475] or to a
   particular QoS class, e.g., Y.1541 QoS class or DiffServ-aware MPLS
   traffic engineering (DSTE) class type [RFC3564], [RFC4124].

   than 162 (i.e., positive 35) are discouraged, except for specifying a
   peak rate of infinity.  Infinity is represented with an exponent of
   all ones (255) and a sign bit and mantissa of all zeroes.

   contains values measured in microseconds and its value can range from
   0 to (2**32)-1 microseconds.

3.8.  Priority AVP

   The Priority AVP is a grouped AVP consisting of two AVPs, the
   Preemption-Priority and the Defending-Priority AVP.  A description of
   the semantic can be found in [RFC3181].


                       Priority  ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                                     { Preemption-Priority }
                                     { Defending-Priority }

3.8.1.  Preemption-Priority AVP

   The Preemption-Priority AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32 and
   it indicates the priority of the new flow compared with the defending
   priority of previously admitted flows.  Higher values represent
   higher priority.

3.8.2.  Defending-Priority AVP

   The Defending-Priority AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.
   Once a flow is admitted, the preemption priority becomes irrelevant.
   Instead, its defending priority is used to compare with the
   preemption priority of new flows.

3.9.  Admission-Priority AVP

   The Admission-Priority AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.

   The admission control priority of the flow, in terms of access to
   network bandwidth in order to provide higher probability of call
   completion to selected flows.  Higher values represent higher
   priority.  A given admission priority is encoded in this information

   Priority AVP defined in Section 6.2.9 of [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec], or in
   the Admission Priority parameter defined in Section 3.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-emergency-rsvp].  In other words, a given value
   inside the Admission-Priority AVP, inside the [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec]
   admission priority parameter or inside the
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-emergency-rsvp] admission priority parameter, refers
   to the same admission priority.

3.10.  ALRP AVP

   The Application-Level Resource Priority (ALRP) AVP is a grouped AVP
   consisting of two AVPs, the ALRP-Namespace and the ALRP-Priority AVP.

   A description of the semantic of the parameter values can be found in
   [RFC4412] and in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-emergency-rsvp].  The coding for
   parameter is as follows:


                       ALRP  ::= < AVP Header: TBD >

                                 { ALRP-Priority }

3.10.1.  ALRP-Namespace AVP

   The ALRP-Namespace AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.

3.10.2.  ALRP-Priority AVP

   The Path-Jitter-STAT4 AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.

   [RFC4412] defines a resource priority header and established the
   initial registry; that registry was later extended by
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-emergency-rsvp].

3.11.  Excess-Treatment AVP

   The Excess-Treatment AVP is a grouped AVP consisting of two AVPs, the
   Treatment and the Remark-Value AVP.

   The coding for the Excess-Treatment AVP is as follows:


                       Excess-Treatment  ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                                             { Excess-Treatment-Value }
                                             [ Remark-Value ]

3.11.1.  Excess-Treatment-Value AVP

   The Excess-Treatment-Value AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated
   and indicates how a QoS aware node should process out-of-profile
   traffic.  The following values are currently defined:


      0: drop
      1: shape
      2: remark
      3: no metering or policing is permitted

   The default treatment in case that none is specified is that there
   are no guarantees to excess traffic, i.e., a QoS aware node can do
   what it finds suitable.

   When the treatment is set to 'drop', all marked traffic MUST be
   dropped by a QoS aware node.

   When the treatment is set to 'shape', it is expected that QoS
   parameters conveyed as part of QoS-Desired are used to reshape the
   traffic (for example a TMOD parameter indicated as QoS desired).
   When the shaping causes unbounded queue growth at the shaper traffic
   can be dropped.

   When the treatment is set to 'remark', the excess treatment parameter
   MUST carry the remark value.  For example, packets may be remarked to
   drop remarked to pertain to a particular QoS class.  In the latter
   case, remarking relates to a DiffServ-type model, where packets
   arrive marked as belonging to a certain QoS class, and when they are
   identified as excess, they should then be remarked to a different QoS
   Class.  The Remark-Value AVP carries the information used for re-
   marking.

   If 'no metering or policing is permitted' is indicated, the QoS aware
   node should accept the treatment set by the sender with special care
   so that excess traffic should not cause a problem.  To request the
   Null Meter [RFC3290] is especially strong, and should be used with
   caution.

3.11.2.  Remark-Value AVP

   The Remark-Value AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32 and
   contains the DSCP value the excess traffic should be remarked to.

3.11.3.  PHB-Class AVP

   The PHB-Class AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and is two
   octets long.  A description of the semantic of the parameter values
   can be found in [RFC3140].  The coding for the values is as follows:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | DSCP      |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|            (Reserved)         |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   As prescribed in [RFC3140], the encoding for a single PHB is the
   recommended DSCP value for that PHB, left-justified in the 16 bit
   field, with bits 6 through 15 set to zero.

   The encoding for a set of PHBs is the numerically smallest of the set
   of encodings for the various PHBs in the set, with bit 14 set to 1.
   (Thus for the AF1x PHBs, the encoding is that of the AF11 PHB, with
   bit 14 set to 1.)


       0                   1
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | DSCP      |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 X 0|
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   PHBs not defined by standards action, i.e., experimental or local use
   PHBs as allowed by [RFC2474].  In this case an arbitrary 12 bit PHB
   identification code, assigned by the IANA, is placed left-justified
   in the 16 bit field.  Bit 15 is set to 1, and bit 14 is zero for a
   single PHB or 1 for a set of PHBs.  Bits 12 and 13 are zero.


       0                   1
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      PHD ID CODE      |0 0 X 0|
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Bits 12 and 13 are reserved either for expansion of the PHB
   identification code, or for other use, at some point in the future.

   In both cases, when a single PHBID is used to identify a set of PHBs
   (i.e., bit 14 is set to 1), that set of PHBs MUST constitute a PHB
   Scheduling Class (i.e., use of PHBs from the set MUST NOT cause

   intra-microflow traffic reordering when different PHBs from the set
   are applied to traffic in the same microflow).  The set of AF1x PHBs
   [RFC2597] is an example of a PHB Scheduling Class.  Sets of PHBs that
   do not constitute a PHB Scheduling Class can be identified by using
   more than one PHBID.

   The registries needed to use [RFC3140] already exist.  Hence, no new
   registry needs to be created for this purpose.

3.11.4.  DSTE-Class-Type AVP

   The DSTE-Class-Type AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.  A
   description of the semantic of the parameter values can be found in
   [RFC4124].

   Currently, the values of alues currently allowed are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
   5, 6, 7.

3.11.5.  Y.1541-QoS-Class AVP

   The Y.1541-QoS-Class AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.  A
   description of the semantic of the parameter values can be found in
   [Y.1541].

   Currently, the allowed values of the Y.1541 QoS class are 0, 1, 2, 3,
   4, 5, 6, 7.

   Class 0:

      Mean delay <= 100 ms, delay variation <= 50 ms, loss ratio <=
      10^-3.  Real-time, highly interactive applications, sensitive to
      jitter.  Application examples include VoIP, Video Teleconference.

   Class 1:

      Mean delay <= 400 ms, delay variation <= 50 ms, loss ratio <=

      unspecified.  Unspecified applications.  Application examples
      include traditional applications of default IP networks.

   Class 6:

      Mean delay <= 100 ms, delay variation <= 50 ms, loss ratio <=
      10^-5.  Applications that are highly sensitive to loss, such as
      television transport, high-capacity TCP transfers, and TDM circuit
      emulation.

   Class 7:

      Mean delay <= 400 ms, delay variation <= 50 ms, loss ratio <=
      10^-5.  Applications that are highly sensitive to loss, such as
      television transport, high-capacity TCP transfers, and TDM circuit
      emulation.


4.  Extensibility

   This document is designed with extensibility in mind given that
   different organizations and groups are used to define their own
   Quality of Service parameters.  This document provides an initial QoS
   profile with common set of QoS parameters.  Ideally, these parameters
   should be used whenever possible but there are cases where additional
   parameters might be needed, or where the parameters specified in this
   document are used with a different semantic.  In this case it is
   advisable to define a new QoS profile that may consist of new
   parameters in addition to parameters defined in this document or an
   entirely different set of parameters.

   To enable the definition of new QoS profiles a 8 octet registry is
   defined field that is represented by a 4-octet vendor and 4-octet

Internet-Draft               QoS Parameters                     May 2008


   specifier field.  A QoS profile groups together a bunch of QoS
   parameters for usage in a specific environment.  The vendor field
   indicates the type as either standards-specified or vendor-specific.
   If the four octets of the vendor field are 0x00000000, then the value
   is standards-specified and the registry is maintained by IANA, and
   any other value represents a vendor-specific Object Identifier (OID).
   IANA created registry is split into two value ranges; one range uses
   the "Standards Action" and the second range uses "Specification
   Required" allocation policy.  The latter range is meant to be used by
   organizations outside the IETF.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This section defines the registries and initial codepoint
   assignments, in accordance with BCP 26 RFC 2434 [RFC5226].  It also
   defines the procedural requirements to be followed by IANA in
   allocating new codepoints.

   IANA is requested to create the following registries listed in the
   subsections below.

5.1.  QoS Profile

   The QoS Profile refers to a 64 bit long field that is represented by
   a 4-octet vendor and 4-octet specifier field.  The vendor field
   indicates the type as either standards-specified or vendor-specific.
   If the four octets of the vendor field are 0x00000000, then the value
   is standards-specified and the registry is maintained by IANA, and
   any other value represents a vendor-specific Object Identifier (OID).

   The specifier field indicates the actual QoS profile.  The vendor
   field 0x00000000 is reserved to indicate that the values in the
   specifier field are maintained by IANA.  This document requests IANA
   to create such a registry and to allocate the value zero (0) for the
   QoS profile defined in this document.

   For any other vendor field, the specifier field is maintained by the
   vendor.

   For the IANA maintained QoS profiles the following allocation policy
   is defined:
      1 to 511: Standards Action
      512 to 4095: Specification Required

   Standards action is required to depreciate, delete, or modify
   existing QoS profile values in the range of 0-511 and a specification
   is required to depreciate, delete, or modify existing QoS profile

   values in the range of 512-4095.

5.2.  AVP Allocations

   This specification assigns the values TBD1 to TBD2 from the AVP Code
   namespace defined in [RFC3588].  See Section 3 for the assignment of
   the namespace in this specification.

5.3.  Excess-Treatment AVP

   The following values are allocated by this specification:
      Excess Treatment Value 0: drop
      Excess Treatment Value 1: shape
      Excess Treatment Value 2: remark
      Excess Treatment Value 3: no metering or policing is permitted
      Excess Treatment Values 4-63: Standards Action
      Excess Treatment Value 64-2^32-1: Reserved

5.4.  DSTE-Class-Type AVP

   The following values are allocated by this specification:
      DSTE Class Type Value 0: DSTE Class Type 0
      DSTE Class Type Value 1: DSTE Class Type 1
      DSTE Class Type Value 2: DSTE Class Type 2
      DSTE Class Type Value 3: DSTE Class Type 3
      DSTE Class Type Value 4: DSTE Class Type 4
      DSTE Class Type Value 5: DSTE Class Type 5
      DSTE Class Type Value 6: DSTE Class Type 6
      DSTE Class Type Value 7: DSTE Class Type 7
      DSTE Class Type Values 8-63: Standards Action
      DSTE Class Type Values 64-2^32-1: Reserved

5.5.  Y.1541-QoS-Class AVP

   The following values are allocated by this specification:
      Y.1541 QoS Class Value 0: Y.1541 QoS Class 0
      Y.1541 QoS Class Value 1: Y.1541 QoS Class 1
      Y.1541 QoS Class Value 2: Y.1541 QoS Class 2
      Y.1541 QoS Class Value 3: Y.1541 QoS Class 3
      Y.1541 QoS Class Value 4: Y.1541 QoS Class 4
      Y.1541 QoS Class Value 5: Y.1541 QoS Class 5
      Y.1541 QoS Class Value 6: Y.1541 QoS Class 6
      Y.1541 QoS Class Value 7: Y.1541 QoS Class 7
      Y.1541 QoS Class Values 8-63: Standards Action
      Y.1541 QoS Class Values 64-2^32-1: Reserved

   The values in the ALRP-Namespace and ALRP-Priority AV{ inside the
   ALRP AVP take their values from the registry created by [RFC4412] and
