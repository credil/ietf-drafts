Abstract

   PCP Error Recovery allows PCP clients to repair failed mappings
   within seconds, rather than the minutes or hours it might take if
   they relied solely on waiting for the next routine renewal of the
   mapping.  Mappings failures may occur when a NAT gateway is rebooted
   and loses its mapping state, or when a NAT gateway has its external
   IP address changed so that its current mapping state becomes invalid.

2.  PCP Restart Announcement

   When a PCP-enabled [PCP] NAT gateway reboots, restarts its NAT
   engine, or otherwise enters a state where it may have lost some or
   all of its previous mapping state (or doesn't know whether it may
   have had prior mapping state that it lost) it MAY inform PCP clients
   of this fact by multicasting the UDP packet shown below to 224.0.0.1:
   5350 in all interfaces on which it accepts PCP requests.  To
   accommodate packet loss, the PCP-enabled NAT MAY transmit such
   packets up to ten times (with an appropriate Epoch value in each to
   reflect the passage of time between transmissions) provided that the
   interval between the first two notifications is at least 250ms, and
   the interval between subsequent notification at least doubles.

                 Figure 1: PCP Restart Announcement Packet

   A PCP client MAY listen on UDP 224.0.0.1:5350 to receive PCP Restart
   Announcements.  (The SO_REUSEPORT socket option or equivalent should
   be used for the multicast UDP port, if required by the host OS to
   permit multiple independent listeners on the same multicast UDP
   port.)  Upon receiving a PCP Restart Announcement a PCP client MUST
   (as it does with all received PCP response packets) inspect the
   Announcement's source IP address, and if the Epoch value indicates
   that the NAT gateway has begun a new epoch since the last time the
   PCP client received a PCP response message from that PCP server
   address, then for all PCP mappings it made at that address the client
   should issue new PCP requests to to recreate any lost mapping state.

   The use of the Suggested External IP Address and Suggested External
   Port fields allows the client to remind the restarted NAT gateway of
   what mappings the client had previously been given, so that in many
   cases the prior state can be recreated.  For NAT gateways that reboot
   relatively quickly it is usually possible to reconstruct lost mapping
   state fast enough that existing TCP connections and UDP
   communications do not time out and continue without failure.

   The PCP Restart Announcement capability enables you to, for example,
   connect to remote machines using ssh, and then reboot the NAT gateway
   (or even replace it with completely new hardware) without losing your
   established ssh connections.

   Use of PCP Restart Announcements is a performance optimization.
   Without it, PCP clients will still recreate their correct state when
   they next renew their mappings, but this routine self-healing process
   may take hours rather than seconds, and will probably not happen fast
   enough to prevent active TCP connections from timing out.


3.  PCP Mapping Update

   If a PCP-enabled NAT gateway has not forgotten its mapping state, but
   for some other reason has determined that some or all of its mappings
   have become unusable (e.g. when a home gateway is assigned a
   different external IPv4 address by the upstream DHCP server) then the
   NAT gateway MAY chose to remedy this situation by automatically
   repairing its mappings and notifying its clients.

   For PCP MAP mappings, for each one the NAT gateway should update the
   External IP Address and External Port to appropriate available
   values, and then send unicast PCP MAP responses to inform the PCP
   client of the new External IP Address and External Port.  Such MAP
   responses are identical to the MAP responses normally returned in
   response to client MAP requests, except they may be viewed as a long-
   delayed response to an earlier MAP request, containing newly updated
   External IP Address and External Port values.  To accommodate packet
   loss, the PCP-enabled NAT MAY transmit such packets up to ten times
   (with an appropriate Epoch value in each to reflect the passage of
   time between transmissions) provided that the interval between the
   first two notifications is at least 250ms, and the interval between
   subsequent notification at least doubles.  Upon receipt of such long-
   delayed MAP responses, a PCP client MAY choose to use the information
   in them to update its DNS records, or other address and port
   information recorded with some kind of application-specific
   rendezvous server.  Existing TCP connections will be lost, but
   promptly updating the DNS or rendezvous server with the new data will
   allow new connections to be made.

Internet-Draft             PCP Error Recovery                 April 2011


   For PCP PEER mappings there is no general way to recover them (the
   remote host doesn't know the new External IP Address and External
   Port) so existing connections will be lost.  In this case A PCP-
   enabled NAT gateway is not required to take any specific action for
   PEER mappings.  It MAY delete all PEER mappings immediately (and let
   application-layer timeouts detect the failure) or it MAY choose to
   retain them for some time in case another change in the external
   environment (e.g. a lost DHCP-assigned external address is re-
   assigned after a few seconds) results in the mappings becoming usable
   again.


4.  Security Considerations

   Forged PCP Restart Announcements could be used to cause high load on
   a PCP server.

   Forged MAP responses could be used to mislead a PCP client about what
   External IP Address and External Port is has been allocated.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to record that UDP port 5350 is now formally
   reallocated from "NAT-PMP Restart Announcement" to "PCP Restart
   Announcement".
