                  Reserved and Special Names Registry
                draft-levine-reserved-names-registry-00

Abstract

   Within the Domain Name System, several names have been reserved or
   used for special purposes, some at the top level and some at other
   levels.  RFC 2606 identified An IANA registry of Reserved and Special
   Names is established to reduce the likelihood of conflict of names
   and the consequent ambiguity.  This specification establishes that
   registry.

Internet-Draft     Reserved and Special Names Registry     December 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System[RFC1034] [RFC1035] provides a tree-structured
   name space with subtrees delegated to different organizations for
   management.  Other than the root, usually written as ".", no name has
   characteristics technically different from any other.  Nevertheless,
   some names in the DNS have historically been reserved for specific
   purposes, and have not been made available for delegation.  Other
   names do appear within delegated subtrees, but have by convention had
   a specialized interpretation.  The specialized and reserved names
   have hitherto been identified in a variety of documents but never
   listed in one place.  This document creates a registry for these
   reserved and specialized names.

   This document does _not_ attempt to describe rules or practices for
   delegation of subtrees of the DNS.

1.1.  Discussion List

   [[ RFC Editor: please remove this section before publication. ]]

   Until and unless a WG is created, this proposal will be discussed on
   the list ietf@ietf.org


2.  Registry Definition

2.1.  Registry Name

   The recommended name of this registry is "DNS Reserved and Special
   Names".

2.2.  Registry Format

   IANA is requested to establish a registry for DNS reserved and
   special names.  Registration requests and registry entries should
   include the following:

   Name -  The reserved or special name.

   Category -  Reserved, for names not intended to be used on the public
      Internet, or Special, for names intended to be used in specified
      ways.

   Level -  The level in the DNS where this name is reserved, or
      special, at the top level of the DNS, in a leaf name, or at any
      level.

Internet-Draft     Reserved and Special Names Registry     December 2009


   Description -  A brief description of the name and, where
      appropriate, its usage.

   Reference -  A reference to an RFC or other definition of the name.

2.3.  Criteria for Registration

   This registry is intended to collect reserved and special names
   defined in RFCs.  For reserved or special names defined at any
   particular point in the DNS namespace, the organization managing that
   point in the namespace must also concur such as ICANN or its
   successor for the top level.

2.4.  Initial Contents of Registry

   As a service to users of the registry and the authors of existing
   specifications, all currently known reserved and special names are to
   be included into the registry upon creation.

                                  Table 1

   Notes:

   Cat  Category: R is Reserved, S is Special

   Level  Level: Top is Top Level, Leaf is Leaf names only, Any is
      Anywhere other than the top level.

   #1 "_service" means the name of any service, preceded by an
      underscore, such as _LDAP.

   #2 This name appears as the penultimate name of a SRV record, where
      the leaf name is a "_service" name, or as a leaf name.

   #3 "_protocol" means the name of any protocol, preceded by an
      underscore, such as _TCP.  RFC 3861 [RFC3861] created the "Instant
      Messaging SRV Protocol Label Registry" for protocols used in
      Instant Messaging.


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to establish the registry described in Section 2
   using the initial content specified in Section 2.4.

   New entries should be added to this registry when defined in an RFC
   and, if required, the relevant manager for the position in the DNS
   concurs.  See Section 2.3 for specifics.


4.  Security Considerations

   The creation of this registry provides improved documentation and
   protection against interoperability problems.  It introduces no new
   security issues.
