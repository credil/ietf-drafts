 <t>This document analyzes whether the problems encountered by a multi-homed host are satisfactorily addressed
	 by mechanisms currently implemented in operating systems.

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

  <t>

   A multihomed host have multiple provisioning domains via virtual and/or
   physical interfaces.  A multihomed host receives node configuration
   information from each of its access networks, through various mechanisms
   such as DHCP, PPP's IPCP and IPv6 Router Advertisements.  When the
   multihomed host receives various configuration objects (e.g., DNS server
   address, default gateway, address selection policies) with values that
   differ from one administrative domain to another, the node has to decide
   which one to use or how to reconcile them.

  </t>
  
  <t>
	  
  Issues regarding how the multi-homed host uses the configuration objects have
  been addressed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mif-problem-statement" />.  Current
  practices of how the various implementations handle these problems are
  introduced in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mif-current-practices" />.  This
  document analyzes whether the problems encountered by a multi-homed host are
  satisfactorily addressed by mechanisms implemented in operating systems.

<section title="Problem Analysis">

<t>

We group the problems raised in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mif-problem-statement" />
into specific categories as per the subsections below.

<section anchor="name" title="Naming and Addressing">
	<t> 
	                             
   <list style="numbers">

   <t> 

	   The operating systems has node-scoped DNS server addresses but the
	   DNS server addresses provided by a given domain are only reachable
	   through that domain.

   </t>

   <t> 

	   The answers to DNS queries returned by the DNS server of a given
	   domain are only valid and/or reachable within that domain (e.g.,
	   split horizon DNS) but the operating system treats these answers as
	   valid on any domain.

   </t>
   
   <t>

	   Private IPv4 addresses <xref target="RFC1918"/> and Unique Local
	   IPv6 Unicast Addresses <xref target="RFC4193"/> are reachable from
	   within a given domain (i.e., they are site-scoped) but the operating
	   system doesn't know the domain boundary and treats these as
	   reachable on any domain (i.e., they have global scope.)

   </t>

   <t>

	   Private IPv4 addresses <xref target="RFC1918"/> are only
	   unambiguous within a given domain but the operating system doesn't
	   know the domain boundary and cannot associate a Private IPv4 Address
	   to a given domain and thus treats those as valid on any domain.

   </t>

<section anchor="routing" title="Routing">


	<t> 

   <list style="numbers">

	   <t> 

		   Routing tables entries to ambiguous subnet prefixes in <xref
			   target="RFC1918"/> addressing space are only
		   unambiguous within a given domain but the operating system
		   doesn't distinguish routes to the same prefixes belonging to
		   different communication domains, thus leading to use of the
		   wrong outbound interface and wrong destincation gateway.

	   </t>

	 
	   <t> 

		   Routing tables entries with an ambiguous next hop IP address
		   in <xref target="RFC1918"/> addressing space are only to be
		   used within a given domain but the operating system doesn't
		   necessarily know which was the communication domain thus
		   leading to use of the wrong outbound interface and wrong
		   destination gateway, and/or communication failure if no
		   destination gateway is reachable at the destination address
		   or if the destination gateway has no upstream route to the
		   final destination of the packet.

	   </t>




   <t> 

		Host implementations usually do not implement the [RFC1122]
		model where the Type-of-Service are in the routing table which
		could be use to choose between routes with same longest prefix
		match and same metrics but different Type-of-Service
		characteristics, e.g., low delay, high throughput.

   </t>

   </list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Reachability">
	<t>
		<list style="numbers">

   	   <t> 

		   Ingress filtering can prevent communication when a node sends
		   packets from a source address allocated from a given domain
		   to a (default) router in another domain.

	   </t> 
      
	   <t> 

		   Strong host model implementaion can cause incoming packets
		   to be discarded when they are sent to a destination address
		   assigned to one of the interface of the node that is not the
		   interface on which the packet is incoming.

	   
	   </t>

	   <t> 

		   There is no interface between a router and a host for the
		   router to indicate that there is no default route but only
		   specific routes to some prefixes. As a result, a node
		   that discovers a router assumes that any destination is
		   reachable, which might not always be the case: in some case
		   only connectivity to destination in the domain is available,
		   and other destinations are unreachable, e.g., walled
		   gardens, corporate intranets, etc.

	   </t>

   <!--  <t>Host implementations usually do not keep path characteristics,
        user or provider preferences in the routing table.
   Note: Path characteristics would be useless absent an interface 
   that let applications specify their QoS requirement. 
   As to user/provider preferences, that can be done today in a routing 
   table by playing with the routing metric.
   </t>
   -->
   </list>
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="dosel" title="Domain Selection">
	<t>
	<list style="numbers">
	<t>

		Application usually does not specify to which domain they want
		to communicate. When the destination has an unambiguous address
		the domain can sometimes be derived from that. This is however
		not the case when the destination is an ambiguous address from
		<xref target="RFC1918"/>.
		
	</t>

	<t>
		Some applications require domain affinity. There should
		be some way to set it either by the application itself or by
		the system on behalf of the application.  Therefore the system
		should be cognizant of domains.

<section anchor="addsel" title="Address Selection ">

	<t> 
   
   <list style="numbers">
   
      <t> Default Address Selection policies are usually node-scoped. </t>
      
      <t> Note: What would be needed it seems is domain scoped policies. </t> 
      
      <t> Default Address Selection policies may differ when received on
        different provisioning domains.
       Note: What would be needed it seems is domain scoped policies. </t>       
      
      <t>Host implementations usually do not implement the [RFC1122]
        strong model where the source address is in the routing table.
      Note: Having the source address in the routing table would avoid 
      issues with ingress filtering. But this seems chicken and egg. Currently the 
      source address selection occurs as a result of a route lookup. So it seems 
      it makes more sense to first select a domain, then lookup the route in the 
      domain-scoped route, and finally perform source address selection as per this domain policies.
      </t> 
      
      <t>Applications usually do not use advanced APIs to specify the
        source IP address or to set preferences on the address selection
        policies.
      Note: having application specify source IP address is overkill. 
      An application is primarily interested on connecting to a destination, 
      thus it needs a connectivity provider. Once the connectivity provider 
      has been selected the source address can be picked automatically as a result of the route lookup.

		   Operating system does not keep separate, per domain copies
		   of same configuration objects (e.g., DNS server addresses,
		   NTP server addresses, ..) and thus these are either
		   overwritten by the operating system when received from
		   multiple provisioning domains, or ignored when not received
		   on a so-called primary interface.

      </t>
      
      <t> 

	      There's no way yet to handle multiple policies coming from
	      different domains. E.g., corporate node usage typically means
	      that the corporation issues some policy on that Wi-Fi interface
	      (and others as well).  In this case, the carrier and corporation
	      domains and their policies will overlap over the Wi-Fi interface.
	      Having a common policy language might help to detect and reason
	      about such conflicts, but conflict resolution is another problem.
	      Ultimately, the issue are the different authorities on these
	      domains (e.g., user at home, admin at corporation and carrier for
	      wireless broadband) and how they resolve their conflicts in the
	      overlap situations.  Note: Domains and their policies may span
	      multiple interfaces.  There is a fixed hierarchy of domains and
	      their authorities, but the top authority may decide to delegate
	      to others certain parts of the system and to their policies, as
	      long as these don't conflict with his. A conflict resolution that
	      respects the hierarchy is needed.
