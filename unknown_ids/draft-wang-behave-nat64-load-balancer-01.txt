 Abstract 

    [STANDBY] has discussed how to achieve load-balancing among a group 
    of NAT64 devices, however, it doesn't mention the mechanism to 
    achieve load-balancing with load-balancers, e.g., how to assign 
    different prefix64s to different hosts. In this memo, we propose our 
    investigation on this topic.

 Internet-Draft       Some Considerations on the         February 2010 
                       Load-Balancer for NAT64                           
     

 1. Introduction  

    NAT64 gateway [NAT64] is an equipment for data translation between 
    IP v4 and v6 address families. With the development of the network, 
    the data transmission volume is increasing rapidly. In order to 
    facilitate the NAT64 system scalability and resilience, load-
    balancing is one of the most important requirements for NAT64 
    systems. [STANDBY] has discussed the load-balancing mechanism for 
    NAT64, however, the load-balancer mechanism has not been defined 
    explicitly. This memo analyzes and summarizes the different prefix 
    selection policies and load-balancer approaches, which are used 
    together with the corresponding address synthesis approaches defined 
    in [DNS64] and [Learn_Prefix]. 

 2. Terminology 

    This memo makes use of the terms defined in [NAT64] and [DNS64]. 
    Below are provided terms specific to this document: 

    Prefix64: an IPv6 prefix used for synthesizing IPv6 addresses for 
    the IPv4 hosts. See [Format] for more details. 

    NAT64 System: one NAT64 device or two NAT64 devices in a 1+1 
    redundancy configuration.  At NAT64 system is responsible for the 
    translation of all packets destine to a given Prefix64.  There is a 
    tight coupling of a NAT64 device, Prefix64, and a set of public IPv4 
    addresses. 

 3. Prefix Selection Policy  

    The load-balancer enables an IPv6 client to be assigned to a certain 
    NAT64 box by distributing a certain prefix64 that is associated with 
    a functioning and available NAT64 system.  E.g., there are two or 
    more NAT64 systems (NAT64-A and NAT64-B, where NAT64-A may actually 
    be 2 devices configured for local 1+1 redundancy) providing protocol 
    translation between an IPv6 network and the IPv4 Internet, and 
    prefix64-A and prefix64-B corresponding to NAT64-A and NAT64-B 
    separately. An IPv6 client in the IPv6 network wants to initiate a 
    communication with an IPv4 server in the IPv4 Internet. If the load-
    balancer allocates prefix64-A for the session, the IPv6 client will 
    choose NAT64-A to communicate with the IPv4 server, and if prefix64-
    B, will choose NAT64-B. 

    In order to achieve load balancing for a set of NAT64 boxes, a load-
    balancer can allocate prefix64s for the IPv4 server based on prefix

 Internet-Draft       Some Considerations on the         February 2010 
                       Load-Balancer for NAT64                           
     

    selection policies, thus the load can be distributed on all 
    available NAT64 systems within a given autonomous system's defined 
    scope. This section provides some prefix selection policies, three 
    static and one dynamic. These policies are not specific to any load-
    balancer mechanism. 

3.1. Source-Based Prefix Selection Policy  

    A source-based prefix selection policy allows a load-balancer to 
    choose prefix64s according to the IP address of the requesting 
    client. In the above example, one of the prefix selection policies 
    is to choose prefix64s according to the parity of the IP address of 
    the requesting client, and the load-balancer can choose prefix64-A 
    if the IPv6 address of the requesting client is odd, and prefix64-B 
    if even. 

 3.1.1. Pros 

    1. Simple and has enough entropy to ensure reasonable load balancing 
       across 2 systems. 

    2. The users are consistently assigned to the same NAT64 for every 
       transaction.  This is important because some application identify 
       a unique user across multiple transactions using the source IP 
       address, examples include FTP and SSL VPNs. 

 3.1.2. Cons 

    The cons of this policy are left for the future exploration. 

3.2. Destination-Based Prefix Selection Policy 

    A destination-based prefix selection policy is that a load-balancer 
    chooses prefix64s according to the IP address of the IPv4 server. In 
    the above example, load-balancer can choose prefix64-A if the IPv4 
    address of the IPv4 server queried by the requesting client is odd, 
    and prefix64-B if even. 

 3.2.1. Pros 

    The pros of this policy are left for the future exploration.

 Internet-Draft       Some Considerations on the         February 2010 
                       Load-Balancer for NAT64                           
     

 3.2.2. Cons 

    1. A given user will be represented by multiple public IPv4 
        addresses since a source will go to multiple NAT64 systems. This 
        is important because some application identify a unique user 
        across multiple transactions using the source IP address, 
        examples include FTP and SSL VPNs. 

    2. Since there are more viewers than content, there is not enough 
        entropy to ensure good load balancing.  The NAT64 system that 
        services a major site like Google or Facebook will take too much 
        traffic. Though we can define some strategies to make major 
        sites evenly assigned to different NAT64s, e.g., Google to 
        NAT64-A, Facebook to NAT64-B, but that seems to be static and 
        manual process. 

3.3. Round-Robin Prefix Selection Policy  

    A round-robin prefix selection policy allows a load-balancer to 
    choose prefix64s according to the arriving sequence of the 
    requesting session. In the above example, load-balancer can choose 
    prefix64-A to the first arriving requesting session, prefix64-B to 
    the second, prefix64-A to the third, prefix64-B to the fourth, and 
    so on. 

 3.3.1. Pros 

    The pros of this policy are left for the future exploration. 

 3.3.2. Cons 

    1. Requires DNS64 or DHCP to have a state table to keep track of 
       assignments 

3.4. Dynamic Prefix Selection Policy  

    The above three policies are all static prefix selection policies, 
    though they could pre-evaluate the capabilities of NAT64 boxes based 
    on some criterions and allocate the prefix64s according to the 
    capabilities of their NAT64 boxes, whereas once the evaluation is 
    finished, these policies are fixed and can't reflect NAT64s' timely 
    load changes. If we intend to enable load-balancer to change the 
    prefix64s according to NAT64s' real-time load changes, a dynamic 
    prefix selection policy is necessary. A DNS64 system or DHCPv6 may 
    SNMP poll the NAT64 for key performance indicators such as CPU

    utilization, free memory, concurrent sessions, and sessions per 
    second.  Based on the relative loading of the systems, the load 
    balancing mechanism can distribute new load proportionally. This 
    method perhaps brings a certain amount of system complexities, so 
    some simplified performance indicators can be considered. This is 
    the choice of the implementors.  

    The pros and cons of this policy are left for the future exploration. 

 4. Load-balancer Selection 

    A load-balancer can be a DNS64, a DNS server, a DHCP server, an edge 
    router, or the IPv6 host self. There are some special considerations 
    with the different load-balancers.  

4.1. DNS64 as Load-balancer 

    DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA resource records (RRs) 
    from A RRs. Together with NAT64 translator, these two mechanisms 
    enable an IPv6-only client to initiate communications to an IPv4-
    only server using the FQDN of the server. DNS64 synthesizes an AAAA 
    RR from an A RR containing a real IPv4 address of the responder and 
    a prefix64. 

    In the scenario of an IPv6 client in an IPv6 network wants to 
    initiate a communication with an IPv4 server in the IPv4 Internet, 
    for load balancing DNS64 decides which prefix64 to be used in the 
    synthesized response based on one of the prefix selection policies 
    defined in the section 3. With the synthesized IPv6 address, the 
    IPv6 client will choose the NAT64 corresponding to the prefix64 of 
    the IPv6 address is synthesized with to communicate with the IPv4 
    server. 

4.2. Prefix64 Assigner as Load-balancer 

    [Learn_Prefix] has provided some mechanisms for the hosts in the 
    IPv6 network to obtain the prefix64 of their NAT64, with the 
    prefix64 the hosts could synthesize an appropriate IPv6 address that 
    will be routed to the translator for the translator to process. In 
    the context of load balancing for NAT64 boxes, these mechanisms have 
    some special consideration.

 Internet-Draft       Some Considerations on the         February 2010 
                       Load-Balancer for NAT64                           
     

 4.2.1. DNS Server as Load-balancer 

    [Learn_Prefix] has defined a NAPTR RR to represent NAT64's prefix64. 
    To achieve load balancing for NAT64 boxes, there is a requirement to 
    add multiple NAPTR RRs to zone file corresponding to each prefix64. 
    Upon receiving a NAPTR query, DNS server responses to the requestor 
    one of these NAPTR RRs based on source-based or round-robin or 
    dynamic prefix selection policy. Because having no knowledge of the 
    IP address of the queried IPv4 server, destination-based prefix 
    selection policy is not suitable in this case. 

 4.2.2. DHCPv6 Server as Load-balancer 

    Another mechanism for a host to learn the prefix64 of its NAT64 
    described in [Learn_Prefix] is to make DHCP server to allocate 
    prefix64 to the hosts. The prefix selection policy can be source-
    based, round-robin, or dynamic. Because having no knowledge of the 
    IP address of the IPv4 server which its client wants to communicate 
    with, DHCPv6 server can't use destination-based prefix selection 
    policy.  

    Alternatively, the DHCPv6 server can allocate a DNS64 server as part 
    of the standard DHCPv6 host configuration process where the DHCPv6 
    server provides and DNS server to the client.  The DNS64 server in 
    this instance provides synthesized AAAA records using a unique 
    prefix64 serviced by a unique NAT64 system.  In this way, the DHCPv6 
    assigns one of many available DNS64 and NAT64 combinations which 
    serve synthesized AAAA to the host.  So, the DHCPv6 pushes one of 
    many DNS64 servers to the host, and the DNS64 server drives traffic 
    to one of many NAT64 systems. 

 4.2.3. Default Gateway as Load-balancer 

    [Learn_Prefix] also uses Router Advertisement (RA) messages to 
    transfer the prefix64 to the IPv6 hosts. If the edge router is 
    attached to only one multicast link, no prefix selection policy 
    defined in the section 3 can be used. If the edge router is attached 
    to multiple multicast links, the prefix selection policy can be 
    source-based or round-robin or dynamic. Due to have no knowledge of 
    the IP address of the IPv4 server which its host wants to 
    communicate with, edge router can't use destination-based prefix 
    selection policy.

 4.2.4. IPv6 Client as Load-balancer 

    Multiple prefix64s are learnt through the approaches defined in 
    [learn-prefix], it's up to the IPv6 client to determine which prefix 
    is used. The prefix selection policy can be destination-based, 
    source-based (only one prefix64 is used) or round-robin or dynamic.
