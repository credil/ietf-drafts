         Leaf discovery mechanism for mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP
               draft-jin-mpls-mldp-leaf-discovery-00.txt

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for an mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP
   root node to discover the leaf nodes information.  This allows the
   root node gets the full information of the leaf node for one
   specified P2MP/MP2MP LSP.  Such kind of function provides a general
   method for mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP leaf node discovery, which will
   be used for multiplexing/aggregation by various mLDP applications,
   e.g, P2MP PW [I-D.draft-martini-pwe3-p2mp-pw], VPLS multicast
   [I-D.draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast], L3VPN multicast
   [I-D.draft-ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast] and etc.

Internet-Draft     draft-jin-mpls-mldp-leaf-discovery         March 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document proposes a general mechanism for the mLDP based P2MP/
   MP2MP LSP root node to discover the leaf nodes information.  Such a
   general mechanism can be used for multiplexing/aggregation by various
   mLDP applications, e.g, P2MP PW [I-D.draft-martini-pwe3-p2mp-pw],
   VPLS multicast [I-D.draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast], L3VPN multicast
   [I-D.draft-ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast] and etc.  In order to impact the
   mLDP scalability as little as possible, this draft provides a
   discovery mechanism based on a singling session between each leaf and
   root node.  Each leaf node will report the leaf node information to
   root node through this signaling session.  There will be two
   signaling protocols to be used for leaf node discovery, target LDP
   [RFC5036] or BGP auto-discovery using BGP Multiprotocol Extensions
   [RFC4760].  In order to make the solution simple and clear without
   introducing other protocol to mLDP, this draft will only focuses on
   the singling protocol based on target LDP.  Other signaling protocol
   solutions are out of the scope of this draft.


2.  Motivation

   [I-D.draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] describes the mechanism of setting up
   mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP.  There is a management limitation for mLDP
   that none of the members belong to P2MP/MP2MP LSP topology does not
   know all the members of the P2MP/MP2MP LSP.  That means the root node
   can not get the whole P2MP/MP2MP LSP member information from any of
   node.  This problem will cause some multiplexing/aggregation
   limitation for mLDP applications.

   [I-D.draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast] describes the mechanism of setting
   up multicast tree in VPLS.  When setting up a inclusive P-Multicast
   tunnel, BGP A-D is used to do the VPLS membership auto-discovery.
   The mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP will be set up when receiving auto-
   discovery routes through BGP A-D.  The root node will only know the
   mLDP LSP leaf node information which is triggered by the specific BGP
   A-D mechanism.  If there does already exist an mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP
   LSP_a (this LSP is not set up by BGP A-D, but maybe by static
   configuration) on root node, and the mLDP based LSP_a has same leaf
   nodes as the LSP that above VPLS multicast BGP A-D tries to set up.
   But the root node does not know the original mLDP based LSP_a leaf
   node information, and it will set up mLDP based LSP_b triggered by
   BGP A-D with same root and leaf nodes .  This causes mLDP based LSP
   resources waste in the network.  It is not necessary to setup two
   non-TE LSPs with same root and leaves at the same time in one
   network.  Then multicast VPLS can only aggregate to mLDP P2MP/MP2MP
   LSP which is triggered by its own BGP A-D mechanism.  There is a
   similar problem for [I-D.draft-ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast], and L3VPN



Jin et al.              Expires September 2, 2010               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     draft-jin-mpls-mldp-leaf-discovery         March 2010


   multicast can only aggregate to mLDP P2MP/MP2MP LSP which is
   triggered by its own BGP A-D mechanism.

   [I-D.draft-martini-pwe3-p2mp-pw] describes the P2MP PW setup and
   signaling mechanism.  P2MP PW needs P2MP LSP to do multiplexing/
   demultiplexing [I-D.draft-ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-requirements], then root
   node should determine whether this P2MP PW can multiplex to one of
   the already existing P2MP LSP.  If mLDP is used to setup P2MP LSP,
   the root node is required to know leaf node information of mLDP based
   P2MP LSP, then it can determine if there is some leaf overlap between
   P2MP PW and P2MP LSP.  According to the draft, the mLDP based P2MP
   LSP will be triggered by label mapping message on leaf node, hence
   root node will get the mLDP based P2MP LSP leaf nodes information
   through LDP label mapping message.  However, root node of mLDP based
   P2MP LSP does not know any of the leaf node information if the P2MP
   LSP is setup by other application, e.g, static configuration.  Then
   P2MP PW can only multiplex to mLDP P2MP/MP2MP LSP which is triggered
   by LDP label mapping message.

   According to the above analysis, the mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP setup
   by various applications can not be shared for multiplexing/
   aggregation with each other.  The introduced general leaf discovery
   mechanism for mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP will assist various
   applications to share one P2MP/MP2MP LSP for multiplexing/
   aggregation.


3.  Terminology

   mLDP: Multicast LDP.

   T-LDP: Target LDP.

   P2MP LSP: An LSP that has one Ingress LSR and one or more Egress
   LSRs.

   MP2P LSP: An LSP that has one or more Ingress LSRs and one unique
   Egress LSR.

   MP2MP LSP: An LSP that connects a set of nodes, such that traffic
   sent by any node in the LSP is delivered to all others.

   Bud LSR: An LSR that is an egress but also has one or more directly
   connected downstream LSRs.

   Ingress LSR: Source of the P2MP LSP, also referred to as root node.

   Egress LSR: One of potentially many destinations of an LSP, also

Internet-Draft     draft-jin-mpls-mldp-leaf-discovery         March 2010


   referred to as leaf node in the case of P2MP and MP2MP LSPs.

   Transit LSR: An LSR that has one or more directly connected
   downstream LSRs.

   Leaf node: A Leaf node can be either an Egress or Bud LSR when
   referred in the context of a P2MP LSP.  In the context of a MP2MP
   LSP, an LSR is both Ingress and Egress for the same MP2MP LSP and can
   also be a Bud LSR.

   P2MP FEC: The P2MP FEC Element consists of the address of the root of
   the P2MP LSP and an opaque value.

   MP2MP FEC: MP2MP FEC consists of MP2MP downstream FEC and upstream
   FEC Element.

   MP FEC: Includes both P2MP FEC and MP2MP FEC.


4.   Leaf discovery mechanism

   This section will introduce the discovery mechanism based on T-LDP
   session.  Each leaf node will report the leaf node information to
   root through this T-LDP session.  Each leaf node will setup a T-LDP
   session with root node if there is no LDP session between leaf node
   and root node.

4.1.  Leaf node identifier encoding

   A leaf node identifier will uniquely identify a leaf node in the MPLS
   network.  A new opaque value can be defined in P2MP/MP2MP FEC Element
   to identify the leaf node, see the figure below.


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      ~      Leaf Node Address        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Figure 1

   Type: this type of opaque value is to be assigned by IANA.

Internet-Draft     draft-jin-mpls-mldp-leaf-discovery         March 2010


   Length: The length of address value, determined by the address type.

   Address Family: two octet quantity containing a value from ADDRESS
   FAMILY NUMBERS in [RFC 3232] that encodes the address family.

   Address Length: Length of the Leaf Node Address in octets.

   Leaf Node Address: A host address encoded according to the Address
   Family field.

   To be noted that the type means that it is the leaf node address for
   this P2MP/MP2MP FEC.  The leaf node identifier MUST be attached
   together with P2MP/MP2MP FEC Element if leaf discovery mechanism
   described in this draft is required.

4.2.  Leaf operation status TLV encoding

   There will be two operations for leaf node, add and delete.  It is
   necessary to define a new "leaf node identifier" operation status TLV
   for LDP notification messages.  The operation status TLV is defined
   from the LDP MP Status Value Element, see the figure below.


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   Type(TBD)   |           Length              |   add/delete  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Figure 2

   Type: this type of LDP MP status value element is to be assigned by
   IANA.

   Length: 1 octet for the value.

   Value: 
        0x01 (to be assigned by IANA): means add operation of "leaf
        node identifier";
        0x02 (to be assigned by IANA): means delete operation of "leaf
        node identifier";

   When the notification message contains the "leaf node identifier"
   operation status TLV, the LDP MP FEC TLV MUST also be included in the
   message.  When the node receives the notification with "leaf node
   identifier" operation status TLV, but without LDP MP FEC TLV, an LDP
   notification with "missing message parameters" status (code 0x16)
   should be generated.  The format of Notification message is same as

   section 6.2 of [I-D.draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp-08].

4.3.  Node operation

   The mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP leaf discovery mechanism can be
   operated as follows.

   For every leaf node, there will be a T-LDP session to be setup
   between root and leaf node.  This T-LDP session can be setup
   automatically or manually, which depends on specific implememtation.
   The leaf node can automatically initiate T-LDP session with root
   node.  When root node receives target-hello, it can actively send
   target-hello to leaf node, so as to setup T-LDP session
   automatically.

   When the leaf node is triggered to join one P2MP LSP, by various
   applications, the leaf node sends label mapping message to its
   upstream node (root or transit node).  At the same time, the leaf
   node sends LDP notification message with MP FEC attached with "leaf
   node identifiers" and operation status TLV "add" to its root node.
   When the root node receives the LDP notification message with MP FEC
   attached with "leaf node identifiers" and operation status TLV "add",
   it will store the leaf node information associated with the specified
   P2MP/MP2MP LSP locally.

   When the leaf node is triggered to leave one P2MP/MP2MP LSP, by
   various applications, the leaf node sends label withdraw message to
   its upstream node (root or transit node).  At the same time, the leaf
   node sends LDP notification message with MP FEC attached with "leaf
   node identifiers" and operation status TLV "delete" to its root node.
   When the root node receives the LDP notification message with MP FEC
   attached with "leaf node identifiers" and operation status TLV
   "delete", it will delete the leaf node information associated with
   the specified P2MP/MP2MP LSP locally.

   If the LSR receives the label mapping/withdraw message with "leaf
   node identifiers", it will ignore this opaque value or send an LDP
   notification message to the downstream node with "Unknown TLV" status
   (code 0x06).


5.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations apply as for the multicast LDP
   specification, as described in [I-D. draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates a new name space (the LDP MP Opaque Value
   Element type) that is to be managed by IANA, and the allocation of
   the value for leaf operation status "add/delete".

   This document requires allocation of one opaque value type: 
   1. Leaf node identifier type "C requested value 0x03

   This document requires allocation of one LDP MP status TLV type: 
   1. Leaf operation status TLV "C requested value 0x01
