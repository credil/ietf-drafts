			<t>
				The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Caller Preferences" extension defined in RFC 3840
				<xref target="RFC3840" pageno="false" format="default" /> provides a mechanism that allows a 
				SIP message to convey information relating to the originator's supported features/capabilities.
			</t>
			<t>
				It can be useful for SIP proxies to indicate supported feature/capabilities, that might
				trigger actions and enable functions in other SIP entities.
			</t>
			<t>
				This document defines requirements for a mechanism that would allow SIP
				proxies to convey information related to the proxy's supported features/capabilities.

			<section title="Use-case: IMS Service Continuity, handover of session in alerting state" toc="default">
				<t>
 					The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines a IP Multimedia
   					Subsystem (IMS) Service Continuity mechanism <xref target="3GPP.23.237" pageno="false" 
					format="default" /> for handover of Packet Switched (PS) sessions to Circuit Switched (CS) 
					calls.
				</t>
				<t>
   					The handover is controlled by a Service Centralization and
   					Continuity Application Server (SCC AS). When a session is established 
					the User Equipment (UE) needs to determine whether SCC AS in signalling path 
					of the session supports handover of session in alerting state (i.e. 180 Ringing 
					response has already been sent or received but the dialog is not confirmed dialog yet) 
					or not.
				</t>
				<t>
					When handover occurs and a session in alerting state exists and both UE and SCC AS 
					indicated support of the handover of session in alerting state, then the UE and SCC 
					AS perform handover for the session in alerting state. 
				</t>
				<t>
					NOTE: The UE indicates the support of the handover of session in alerting state by the 
					feature tag included in Contact header field.
				</t>

			<section title="Use-case: IMS Enhanced Service Continuity" toc="default">
				<t>
					The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines a IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) 
					Service Continuity mechanism <xref target="3GPP.23.237" pageno="false" format="default" /> 
					for handover of Packet Switched (PS) sessions to Circuit Switched (CS) calls. The handover 
					can be performed by a Service Centralization and Continuity Application Server (SCC AS), 
					or by a SCC AS together with an Access Transfer Control Function (ATCF), that acts as a 
					SIP proxy. Delegating part of the session handover functionality to an ATCF provides 
					advantages related to voice interruption during session handover etc, since the ATCF is 
					located in the same network as the user.
				</t>
			<section title="Use-case: IMS Enhanced Service Continuity, ATCF discovery" toc="default">
				<t>
					In order for an SCC AS to delegate part of the session handover functionality to an ATCF, 
					when the SCC AS is informed by the registrar about an accepted REGISTER transaction, the SCC AS
					needs to determine whether a proxy supporting the ATCF functionality is in the registration path.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Use-case: IMS Enhanced Service Continuity, identifying sessions subject to handover" toc="default">
				<t>
					In order for ATCF to perform the delegated part of the session handover functionality, when a 
					session is set up, the ATCF needs to determine whether a SIP proxy supporting the SCC AS functionality 
					is in the signalling path of the session.
				</t>
			</section>
			</section>
			<section title="Use-case: IMS Inter-UE Transfer" toc="default">
				<t>
					The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines inter-UE transfer enhancements
					<xref target="3GPP.24.837" pageno="false" format="default" /> 
					which enhance delivery of media of a session to several User Equipments (UE).
				</t>
				<t>
					The Service Centralization and Continuity Application Server (SCC AS) serving one of the UEs 
					acts as local hub for the session. The UE controls the media of the session and is called 
					controller UE.
				</t>
				<t>
					Triggered by requests from the controller UE, the SCC AS serving the controller UE transfers 
					media of the session to other UEs, called controlee UEs, by sending INVITE request offering 
					the media to be transferred.  
				</t>
				<t>
					When an INVITE request is routed to the UE, the SCC AS serving the UE
					needs to determine whether a SIP proxy supporting the inter-UE
					transfer enhancements functionality (i.e. SCC AS of the
					controller UE) is already in the signalling path.
				</t>
				<t>
					If so, the SCC AS proxies the signalling without further handling as there is already an 
					existing local hub for the session.
				</t>
				<t>
					If not, the SCC AS acts as local hub for the session.

		<section title="Requirements" toc="default">		
				<t>
					REQ-1:	It MUST be possible for a SIP proxy to indicate, and convey to other 
					SIP entities in the signalling path of a registration request, support of a 
					particular feature/capability.
				</t>
				<t>
					REQ-2:	It MUST be possible for a SIP proxy to indicate, and convey to other 
					SIP entities in the signalling path of a dialog-forming request, support of a 
					particular feature/capability.
				</t>
				<t>
					REQ-3:	It MUST be possible for a SIP proxy to indicate that the indicated 
					support of a feature/capability only applies to other SIP entities in the 
					direction towards one of the SIP endpoints in the signalling path.
				</t>
				<t>
					REQ-4: A SIP proxy MUST NOT, when indicating support of a feature/capability, 
					make any assumptions that SIP entities in the signalling path that receive the 
					indicator will support, or understand the meaning of, the feature/capability, 
					or even support the proxy feature/capability indication mechanism as a whole.
				</t>				
				<t>
					REQ-5: A SIP proxy MUST be able to indicate support of a feature/capability
					to other SIP entities in the signaling path, even if some SIP entities in the
					signaling path (possibly including the UAC and/or UAS) do not support, or
					understand the meaning of, the feature/capability, or even support the 
					proxy feature/capability indication mechanism as a whole.
				</t>
				<t>
					REQ-6: It MUST be possible to indicate whether indicated support of a
					feature/capability applies to specific registration, to a specific
					dialog, or to all dialogs created as part of INVITE transaction.
				</t>
				<t>
					NOTE: This requirement might be fully implemented as part of the protocol 
					mechanism, or parts might be left to be specified in a feature/capability 
					specification, or it might be left to be specified in a feature/capability 
					specification completely.
				</t>
				<t>
					REQ-7:	It MUST be possible to assign additional parameters (either as a 
					single value, or a list of values) to a feature/capability indicator, in 
					order to provide additional information about the feature/capability.				
				</t>
				<t>
					REQ-8:	If a SIP entity receives a feature support indication that it 
					does not understand, it MUST act as if it hadn't received the indication.
				</t>
				<t>
					REQ-9: If a SIP entity that does not support the proxy feature/capability 
					indication mechanism receives a feature support indication, it MUST act as 
					if it hadn't received the indication.	
				</t>				
				<t>
					REQ-10:	Other SIP entities MUST be able to make routing decisions based 
					on received feature/capability support indications.
				</t>
				<t>
					REQ-11:	A feature/capability support indicator MUST only be used to indicate 
					support of a feature/capability, and MUST NOT be used to indicate whether 
					procedures associated with the feature/capability have been applied or not.
				</t>
				<t>
					REQ-12:	A procedure for registering feature/capability indication values with 
					IANA MUST be defined.
				</t>

    	<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-security" toc="default">
			<t>				
				Feature/capability support indications can provide sensitive information 
				about a SIP entity. RFC 3840 cautions against providing sensitive 
				information to another party. Once this information is given out, 
				any use may be made of it.
