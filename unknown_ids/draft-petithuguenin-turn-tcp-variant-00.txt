Internet-Draft                  TURN TCP                   November 2008


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-behave-turn-tcp] proposes to use a different TCP connection
   between the TURN client and the TURN server for each TCP connection
   between the TURN server and the peer.  This document proposes an
   alternate solution where only one TCP connection is used between the
   TURN client and the TURN server but where a window size adjustement
   algorithm inspired by SSH [RFC4254] is used.

   The following sections describe only the differences with
   [I-D.ietf-behave-turn-tcp]


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Sending a Connect Request

   To initiate a TCP connection to a peer, a TURN client MUST send a
   Connect request to the TURN server over an existing allocation.  The
   Connect request MUST include a XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attribute containing
   the IP address and port of the peer to which a connection is desired,
   a WINDOW-SIZE attribute containing how many bytes of data can be sent
   to the TURN client without adjusting the window, and a MAX-SIZE
   attribute containing the maximum size of a ChannelData or Data
   message can be sent to the TURN client.


4.  Receiving a Connect Request

   When receiving a Connect request, the TURN server MUST establish a
   TCP connection to the IP address and port contained in the XOR-PEER-
   ADDRESS attribute.  If the connection is successful, the TURN server
   sends back to the TURN client a Connect response containing a WINDOW-
   SIZE attribute containing how many bytes of data can be sent to the
   TURN server without adjusting the window, and a MAX-SIZE attribute
   containing the maximum size of a ChannelData or Send message that can
   be sent to the TURN server.  The TURN server associates the current
   window size in the WINDOW-SIZE attribute to the TCP connection to the
   peer.

5.  Receiving a Connect Response

   The TURN server associates the current window size in the WINDOW-SIZE
   attribute to the IP address and port of the peer TCP connection.


6.  Sending Data

   When sending data in a ChannelData, Send or Data message, the sender
   decreases the current window size by the number of bytes sent.  The
   sender MUST stop when the current window size is smaller than the
   size of the data to send.


7.  Sending an AdjustWindow Indication

   When ready to receive more data, the TURN server or client sends an
   AdjustWindow indication to the other side.  The AdjustWindow
   indication MUST contain either a XOR-PEER-ADDRESS or a CHANNEL-NUMBER
   attribute indentifying the TCP connection to the peer.  The
   AdjustWindow indication MUST contain a ADD-SIZE attribute containing
   the value to add to the current window size.


8.  Receiving an AdjustWindow Indication

   When receiving an AdjustWindow indication, a TURN client or server
   uses the XOR-PEER-ADDRESS or CHANNEL-NUMBER to find the current
   window size associated to the TCP connection to the peer.  The TURN
   client or server then increases the window size by the value in the
   ADD-SIZE attribute.


9.  Security Considerations

   TBD


10.  IANA Considerations

   TBD


11.  Running Code Considerations

   TBD
