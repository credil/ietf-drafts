Abstract

   This document describes a way to perform client authentication in the
   Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework by
   referring to the client authentication provided by an external
   security layer.  We specify a SASL mechanism family EXTERNAL-* and
   one instance EXTERNAL-TLS that rely on the Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) protocol.  This mechanism differs to the existing EXTERNAL
   mechanism by alleviating the a priori assumptions that servers and
   clients needs somehow negotiate out of band which secure channel that
   is intended.  This document also discuss the implementation of
   authorization decisions.

   See <http://josefsson.org/external-channel/> for more information.

Internet-Draft                 EXTERNAL-*                     April 2009


1.  Introduction

   The EXTERNAL mechanism, described in Appendix A of [RFC4422] allows a
   client to request the server to use credentials established by means
   external to the mechanism to authenticate the client.  The external
   means may be, for instance, TLS [RFC5246] or IP Security [RFC4301]
   services.

   The EXTERNAL mechanism requires some a prior agreement between the
   client and the server regarding which external channel, and
   consequently which external credentials, should be used for
   authentication.  In practice this has often meant that the EXTERNAL
   mechanism is only used when there is tight out of band interaction
   between the server administration and client user.  This has impacted
   the interoperability of the EXTERNAL mechanism.

   The EXTERNAL-* mechanism family, specified in this document, is
   similar to the EXTERNAL mechanism in that it relies on an external
   channel to perform the client authentication.  However, EXTERNAL-*
   provides a way for the client to provide an identifier of the
   external channel that is intended to provide the client credentials.
   The intention is that the server need not rely on a priori
   arrangement to identify the secure channel that was used, but can
   automatically find the intended channel and re-use its credentials
   for the SASL authentication.  Further, upon successful
   authentication, the client knows that the server used credentials
   from the indicated security channel.

   In the EXTERNAL-* mechanism family, the external channel is
   identified through the SASL mechanism name.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Specification of EXTERNAL-* Mechanism Family

   The name of the mechanism family is "EXTERNAL-".

   The mechanism family does not provide a security layer.  It provides
   similar functionality by relying on an external channel.

   The mechanism is capable of transferring an authorization identity
   string.  If the authorization identity string is empty, the client is
   requesting to act as the identity the server has associated with the
   client's credentials.  If the authorization identity string is non-
   empty, the client is requesting to act as the identity represented by

Internet-Draft                 EXTERNAL-*                     April 2009


   the string.

   The client is expected to send data first in the authentication
   exchange.  Where the client does not provide an initial response data
   in its request to initiate the authentication exchange, the server is
   to respond to the request with an empty initial challenge and then
   the client is to provide its initial response.

   The client sends the initial response containing a UTF-8 [RFC3629]
   encoding of the requested authorization identity string.

   The authorization identity is non-empty when the client is requesting
   to act as the identity represented by the (non-empty) string.  The
   authorization identity is empty when the client is requesting to act
   as the identity the server associates with the external
   authentication credentials.

   The syntax of the initial response is specified as a value of the
   <extern-initial-resp> production detailed below using the Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

      external-initial-resp = authz-id-string

      authz-id-string       = *( UTF8-char-no-nul )
      UTF8-char-no-nul      = UTF8-1-no-nul / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4
           ;; where the UTF8-2, UTF8-3, and UTF8-4 productions are
           ;; as defined in RFC 3629.

      UTF8-1-no-nul         = %x01-7F

   There are no additional challenges and responses.

   Hence, the server is to return the outcome of the authentication
   exchange.

   The external security channel to use is implied by the SASL mechanism
   name.

   The exchange fails if

   - the client has not established its credentials via the indicated
   external channel,

   - the client's credentials are inadequate,

   - the client provided an empty authorization identity string and the
   server is unwilling or unable to associate an authorization identity
   with the client's credentials,



Josefsson               Expires October 20, 2009                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 EXTERNAL-*                     April 2009


   - the client provided a non-empty authorization identity string that
   is invalid per the syntax requirements of the applicable application
   protocol specification,

   - the client provided a non-empty authorization identity string
   representing an identity that the client is not allowed to act as, or

   - the server is unwilling or unable to provide service to the client
   for any other reason.

   Otherwise the exchange is successful.  When indicating a successful
   outcome, additional data is not provided.


3.  Specification of EXTERNAL-TLS Mechanism

   The EXTERNAL-TLS mechanism uses client credentials established by the
   outer TLS [RFC5246] channel.  Only the inner-most TLS channel is
   intended.  For example, if an application opens up a TLS channel and
   starts SASL negotiation, and if that communication happens to be sent
   over a TLS-based VPN, the intended channel is the TLS channel opened
   by the application.

   The server MUST NOT advertise the EXTERNAL-TLS mechanism if the
   client did not provided any supported form of client-side
   authentication in the TLS channel, e.g., X.509 client certificate,
   OpenPGP client key [RFC5081], or SRP [RFC5054].  The client MUST only
   request the EXTERNAL-TLS if it wishes to re-use the TLS client
   credentials for the SASL application.


4.  Making Authorization Decisions

   The server may use any mechanism to make authorization decisions.
   For illustration, we want to give some ideas on how this may work in
   practice.  This section is not normative.

   Typically external channels will not use authentication identities
   that can be used by the application protocol that uses an instance of
   the SASL EXTERNAL-* mechanism.  Thus, a mapping is normally required.
   There may be mappings from the external credential to a set of
   permitted identifiers, and a "default" identifier can be provided in
   the mapping table if the client do not specify a particular
   authorization identity.

   For example, when mapping from X.509 credentials used in TLS
   connections to simple usernames, a table stored on the server can
   contain hex-encoded hashes of client X.509 certificates and a set of

Internet-Draft                 EXTERNAL-*                     April 2009


   usernames.

   d2fc512490a15036460b5489401439d6da5407fa joe

   The server could extract a successfully authenticated X.509 client
   certificate from the TLS stack, hash it and look it up in the mapping
   table.  Each of the usernames given would be permitted authorization
   identities.  The first username given may be the default username if
   the client does not provide an authorization identity.

   When mapping from OpenPGP credentials used in TLS [RFC5081], the
   mapping table could consist of verified OpenPGP fingerprints and a
   set of permitted usernames, such as the following table.

   90A79E2FC6F4AAB5B604974FE15DD857B15C37D1 nikos

   When SRP authentication with TLS [RFC5054] is used, the username
   provided may be the same as the application username, and no mapping
   would be necessary.


5.  Examples

   This section provides examples of EXTERNAL-TLS authentication
   exchanges.  The examples are intended to help the readers understand
   the above text.  The examples are not definitive.  The Application
   Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) [RFC2244] is used in the
   examples because ACAP sends the SASL tokens without additional
   encoding.

   The first example shows use of EXTERNAL-TLS with an empty
   authorization identity.  In this example, the initial response is not
   sent in the client's request to initiate the authentication exchange.

         S: * ACAP (SASL "GSSAPI")
         C: a001 STARTTLS
         S: a001 OK "Begin TLS negotiation now"
         <TLS negotiation, further commands are under TLS layer>
         S: * ACAP (SASL "GSSAPI" "PLAIN" "EXTERNAL-TLS")
         C: a002 AUTHENTICATE "EXTERNAL-TLS"
         S: + ""
         C: + ""
         S: a002 OK "Authenticated"

   The second example shows use of EXTERNAL-TLS with an authorization

Internet-Draft                 EXTERNAL-*                     April 2009


   identity of "simon".  In this example, the initial response is sent
   with the client's request to initiate the authentication exchange.
   This saves a round-trip.

         S: * ACAP (SASL "GSSAPI")
         C: a001 STARTTLS
         S: a001 OK "Begin TLS negotiation now"
         <TLS negotiation, further commands are under TLS layer>
         S: * ACAP (SASL "GSSAPI" "PLAIN" "EXTERNAL-TLS")
         C: a002 AUTHENTICATE "EXTERNAL-TLS" {5+}
         C: simon
         S: a002 NO "Cannot assume requested authorization identity"

   Note how the server rejects the authentication attempt with an
   authorization-related error message.  Presumably the client
   credentials presented in the TLS session does not give the client
   authority to assume the identity of "simon".


6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add to the SASL mechanisms registry the
   following entry.

         Subject: Registration of SASL mechanism family EXTERNAL-*
         SASL family name (or prefix for the family): EXTERNAL-
         Security considerations: [THIS-DOC]
         Published specification (recommended): [THIS-DOC]
         Person & email address to contact for further information:
             Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>
         Intended usage: COMMON
         Owner/Change controller: Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>

   IANA will register new SASL mechanism names under the "EXTERNAL-"
   namespace on a First Come First Served basis, as defined in
   [RFC5226].  IANA has the right to reject obviously bogus registration
   requests, but will perform no review of claims made in the
   registration form.

   Registration of a SASL mechanism under the "EXTERNAL-" namespace is
   requested by filling in the same template used in [RFC4422] using a
   name prefixed with "EXTERNAL-".

   While this registration procedure does not require expert review,
   authors of SASL mechanisms are encouraged to seek community review
   and comment whenever that is feasible.  Authors may seek community
   review by posting a specification of their proposed mechanism as an
   Internet-Draft.  SASL mechanisms intended for widespread use should

Internet-Draft                 EXTERNAL-*                     April 2009


   be standardized through the normal IETF process, when appropriate.


7.  Security Considerations

   The security of external channel is critical to the security of this
   mechanism.  It is important that the client authentication that
   occurs in the outer security channel is cryptographically bound to
   the confidentiality or integrity services that protects the security
   channel.

   The EXTERNAL-* mechanism family does not authenticate clients itself,
   it relies on implementation to perform the authentication as part of
   the external channel.  Care must be taken to ensure that the client
   credential has been authenticated, rather than just blindly accepted
   as part of a leap-of-faith setup.
