Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE Extensions of Associated LSP     February 2011


1.  Introduction

   The associated bidirectional LSP, defined in [RFC5654], is
   constructed from a pair of unidirectional LSPs that are associated
   with each other at the LSP's ingress/egress points.  It is useful for
   protection switching, for Operations, Administrations and Maintenance
   (OAM) messages that require a reply path.  The corresponding
   requirements are also specified in as follow:

   7 MPLS-TP MUST support associated bidirectional point-to-point LSPs.

   11 The end points of an associated bidirectional LSP MUST be aware of
   the pairing relationship of the forward and reverse LSPs used to
   support the bidirectional service.

   12 Nodes on the LSP of an associated bidirectional LSP where both the
   forward and backward directions transit the same node in the same
   (sub)layer as the LSP SHOULD be aware of the pairing relationship of
   the forward and the backward directions of the LSP.

   50 The MPLS-TP control plane MUST support establing associated
   bidirectional P2P LSP including configuration of protection functions
   and any associated maintenance functions.

   Furthermore, these requirements are repeated in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-cp-framework].

   The notion of association as well as the corresponding RSVP
   ASSOCIATION object is defined in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873].  In
   thatcontext, the object is used to associate recovery LSPs with the
   LSP they are protecting.  This object also has broader applicability
   as a mechanism to associate RSVP state, and
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-info] defines the Extended ASSOCIATION object
   that can be more generally applied.

   This document extends the Extended ASSOCIATION object to establish
   associated bidirectional LSPs.

3.  Association of Two Reverse Unidirectional LSPs

3.1.  Provisioning Model

   The associated bidirectional LSP's forward and backward directions
   are set up, monitored, and protected independently [RFC5654], so the
   configurations about it can be sent to one end or two ends.
   Depending on this, there are two models of signaling associated
   bidirectional LSP, one is the single sided provisioning and the other
   is the double sided provisioning.

   For the single sided provisioning, the configurations are sent to one
   end.  Firstly, the associated bidirectional TE tunnel is configured
   on this end, then a LSP under this tunnel is initiated with the
   Extended ASSOCIATION object carried in the Path message to trigger
   the peer end to set up the corresponding associated TE tunnel and
   LSP.

   For the double sided provisioning, the commands are sent to two end
   points.  They establish their associated bidirectional TE tunnels
   independently, then each one starts to set up the LSP using the
   Extended ASSOCIATION objects carried in the Path message to indicate
   each other to associate the two LSPs together to be an associated
   bidirectional LSP.

   It can happen to bind two reverse unidirectional LSPs to be an
   associated bidirectional LSP not only when they are being created,
   but also when they have existed; or when one LSP exists, but the
   other end needs to be established.  To all these scenarios, the
   provisioning models discussed above are applicable.

3.2.  Signaling Procedure

   Consider the following example, two reverse unidirectional LSPs are
   being established or have been established, the forward LSP1 is from
   A to B over [A,D,B], and the associated backward LSP2 is from B to A
   over [B,D,C,A].

                              \     /
                               \   /
                                \ /
                                 C

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE Extensions of Associated LSP     February 2011


   For single sided provisioning model, LSP1 is triggered by LSP2 or
   LSP2 is triggered by LSP1.  When LSP2 is triggered by LSP1, the
   Extended ASSOCIATION object of LSP1 is initialized before the
   Extended ASSOCIATION objects of LSP2, The Extended ASSOCIATION object
   of LSP1 and LSP2 will carry the same value and this value SHOULD be
   LSP1'tunnel ID, LSP ID and tunnel sender address.  When LSP1 is
   triggered by LSP2, the Extended ASSOCIATION object of LSP2 is
   initialized before the Extended ASSOCIATION objects of LSP1, The
   Extended ASSOCIATION object of LSP1 and LSP2 will carry the same
   value and this value SHOULD be LSP2'tunnel ID, LSP ID and tunnel
   sender address.

   For double sided provisioning model, LSP1 and LSP2 are concurrently
   initialized, the values of the Extended ASSOCIATION object carried in
   LSP1's Path message are LSP1's tunnel ID, LSP ID and tunnel sender
   address; the values of the Extended ASSOCIATION object carried in
   LSP2's Path message are LSP1's tunnel ID, LSP ID and tunnel sender
   address.  According to the general rules defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-info], the two LSPs cannot be bound together to
   be an associated bidirectional LSP because of the different values.
   In this case, the two edge nodes should firstly compare their router
   ID, then the bigger one sends Path refresh message, carrying the
   Extended ASSOCIATION object of the reverse LSP.  Based on this Path
   refresh message, the two LSPs can be bounded together to be an
   associated bidirectional LSP also.

3.2.1.  Asymmetric Bandwidth LSPs

   There are some kind of applications, such as internet services and
   the return paths of OAM messages, which MAY have different bandwidth
   requirements for each direction.  [RFC5654] specifies the
   requirements as follow:

   14 MPLS-TP MUST support bidirectional LSPs with asymmetric bandwidth
   requirements, i.e., the amount of reserved bandwidth differs between
   the forward and backward directions.

   The approach for supporting asymmetric bandwidth co-routed
   bidirectional LSPs is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-asymm-bw-bidir-lsps-bis], which introduces three new
   objects named UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object, UPSTREAM_TSPEC object and
   UPSTREAM_ADSPEC object to represent the asymmetric upstream traffic
   flow.  For the asymmetric bandwidth associated bidirectional LSPs,
   the existing SENDER_TSPEC, ADSPEC, and FLOWSPEC are complemented with
   the addition of new REVERSE_TSPEC object, which is used in exactly
   the same fashion as the old SENDER_TSPEC object, but refers to set up
   the reverse unidirectional LSP.

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE Extensions of Associated LSP     February 2011


   In the context of asymmetric associated bidirectional LSP, the
   REVERSE_TSPEC object MUST be carried in the LSP's Path message
   together with the Extended ASSOCIATION object whose Association Type
   is "Association of two reverse unidirectional LSPs" to trigger the
   peer end to set up the reverse LSP with the corresponding asymmetric
   bandwidth.  For the single sided provisioning, the peer end just
   copies the value of the REVERSE_TSPEC object into the SENDER_TSPEC
   object in the Path message.  For the double sided provisioning, the
   ends need to compare the values of the SENDER_TSPEC and REVERSE_TSPEC
   objects in the two Path messages.  If match, the end with the bigger
   router ID sends Path refresh message, carrying the Extended
   ASSOCIATION object of the reverse LSP.

   Nodes not supporting this extension will not recognize the new class
   number and should respond with an "Unknown Object Class".

3.3.  Recovery Considerations

   Assume that LSP3 is used to protect LSP1, which can be established
   before or after the failure occurs, can share the same TE tunnel with
   LSP1 or not.  LSP3 SHOULD inherits the associated bidirectional
   attributes between LSP1 and LSP2 when the traffic is switched from
   LSP1 to LSP3.  This can be done by inserting the Extended ASSOCIATION
   object in LSP3's Path message with the same value as in LSP1's Path
   message.


4.   Extensions to the Extended ASSOCIATION object

   The Extended ASSOCIATION object is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-info].

   The Extended IPv4 ASSOCIATION object (Class-Num of the form 11bbbbbb
   with value = 199, C-Type = TBA) has the format:


      0                   1                   2                   3

   The Extended IPv6 ASSOCIATION object (Class-Num of the form 11bbbbbb
   with value = 199, C-Type = TBA) has the format:


      0                   1                   2                   3

                     Extended IPv6 ASSOCIATION object

   o  Association Type:

   Now, the following values of the Association Type have been defined.


   Value      Type
   -----      ----
   0         Reserved
   1         Recovery (R)
   2         Resource sharing (S)


   In order to bind two reverse unidirectional LSPs to be an associated
   bidirectional LSP, this document defined a new value:


   Value      Type
   -----      ----
   4       Association of two reverse unidirectional LSPs (A)


   If the downstream nodes do not know this Association Type, MUST
   return a PathErr message with error code/sub-code "LSP Admission
   Failure/Bad Association Type".

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE Extensions of Associated LSP     February 2011


   o  Association Source:

   The general rule is that the address is "associated to the node that
   originate the association" and provide global scope (within the
   address space) to identified association,see [RFC4872] and
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-info].  This document adds specific rules: the
   Association source MUST be set to the tunnel sender address of the
   initiating node.

   o  Association ID:

   The association ID is set to a value that uniquely identifies the set
   of LSPs to be associated and the generic definition does not provide
   any specific rules on how matching is to be done.  In order to
   provide global Association ID based on MPLS-TP identifiers, this
   document adds specific rules: the first 16 bits MUST be set to the
   tunnel ID of the initiating node and the following 16 bits MUST be
   set to the LSP ID of the corresponding tunnel, the rest MUST be set
   to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-info], association is always
   done based on matching Path state or Resv state.  Upstream
   initializted association is represented in Extended ASSOCIATION
   objects carried in Path message and downstream initializted
   association is represented in Extended ASSOCIATION objects carried in
   Resv messages.  The new defined association type in this document is
   only defined for use in upstream initializted association.  Thus it
   can only appear in Extended ASSOCIATION objects signaled in Path
   message.

   The rules associated with the processing of the Extended ASSOCIATION
   objects in RSVP message are discussed in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-info].
   It said that in the absence of Association Type-specific rules for
   identifying association, the included Extended ASSOCIATION objects
   MUST be identical.  This document adds no specific rules, the
   association will always operate based on the same Extended
   ASSOCIATION objects.


5.  REVERSE_TSPEC Object

   The REVERSE_TSPEC object is used in Path, PathTear, PathErr, and
   Notify message (via sender descriptor).  This includes the definition
   of class type and format.  It's class number is TBD (of the form
   0bbbbbbb), and class type and format is the same as the SENDER_TSPEC
   object.

   This object modifies the RSVP message-related formats defined in



Zhang & Jing             Expires August 29, 2011                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE Extensions of Associated LSP     February 2011


   [RFC2205], [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].  See [RFC5511] for the syntax
   used by RSVP.  The format of the sender description for asymmetric
   associated bidirectional LSPs is:


   <sender descriptor>::= <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC>
                           [<ADSPEC>]
                           [<RCEORD_ROUTE>]
                           [<SUGGESTED_LABEL>]
                           [<RECOVERY_LABEL>]
                           <REVERSE_TSPEC>




6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to administer assignment of new values for
   namespace defined in this document and summarized in this section.

6.1.  Association Type of Two Reverse Unidirectional LSPs Association

   Within the current document, a new Association Type is defined in the
   Extended ASSOCIATION object.


   Value      Type
   -----      ----
   TBD      Association of two reverse unidirectional LSPs (A)


6.2.  REVERSE_TSPEC Object

   A new class named REVERSE_TSPEC has been created in the 0bbbbbbb rang
   (TBD) with the following definition:

   Class Types or C-types:

   Same values as SENDER_TPSCE object (C-Num 12)

   There are no other IANA considerations introduced by this document.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces a new association type, and except this,
   there are no security issues about the Extended ASSOCIATION object
   are introduced here.

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE Extensions of Associated LSP     February 2011


   Furthermore, this document introduces the REVERSE_TSPEC object for
   use in GMPLS signaling [RFC3473], which is parallel the existing
   SENDER_TSPEC object.  As such, any vulnerabilities that are due to
   the use of the old SENDER_TSPEC object now apply here also.

   Otherwise, this document introduces no additional security
   considerations.  For a general discussion on MPLS and GMPLS related
   security issues, see the MPLS/GMPLS security framework [RFC5920].
