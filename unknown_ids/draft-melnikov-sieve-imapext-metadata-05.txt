1.  Introduction

   This memo defines an extension to the SIEVE mail filtering language
   (RFC 5228) for accessing mailbox and server annotations (variables).
   This allows to customize Sieve engine behaviour based on variables
   set using [METADATA].

1.1.  Implementation note

   An implementation of this extension doesn't need to implement
   [METADATA] or even [IMAP], however it has to use the same data model
   as described in Section 3 of [METADATA].  For example, it should be
   possible to implement the "servermetadata" extension defined in this
   document by making Sieve engine read values from user's [LDAP] or
   [ACAP] entry.  But note that defining LDAP/ACAP schema is out of
   scope for this document.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [Kwds].

   Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section 1.1, including
   the use of [ABNF].

   This document is written with an assumption that readers are familiar
   with data model and terms defined in Section 3 of [METADATA].


3.  mailbox and mboxmetadata Sieve extensions

3.1.  Test mailbox_exists

   Usage:  mailbox_exists <mailbox-names: string-list>

   The "mailbox_exists" test is true if all mailboxes listed in the
   mailbox-names argument exist in the mailstore and each allows the
   "fileinto" action for the user in whose context the Sieve script
   runs.

   The capability string for use with the require command is "mailbox".

   Example: The following example assumes that the Sieve engine also
   supports "reject" [REJECT] and "fileinto" [SIEVE].  However these
   extensions are not required in order to implement the "mailbox".

        require ["fileinto", "reject", "mailbox"];
        if mailbox_exists "Partners" {
           fileinto "Partners";
        } else {
           reject "This message was not accepted by the Mailstore";
        }

3.2.  ':create' argument to 'fileinto' command

   Usage:  fileinto [:create] <mailbox: string>

   If the optional :create argument is specified with "fileinto" it
   instructs Sieve interpreter to create the specified mailbox before
   attempting to deliver the message into the specified mailbox.  If the
   mailbox already exists, this argument is ignored.  Failure to create
   the specified mailbox is considered to be an error.

   The capability string for use with the :create parameter is
   "mailbox".

3.3.  Test metadata

   Usage:  metadata [MATCH-TYPE] [COMPARATOR]
           <mailbox: string>
           <annotation-name: string> <key-list: string-list>

   This test retrieves the value of the mailbox annotation "annotation-
   name" for the mailbox "mailbox" [METADATA].  The retrieved value is
   compared to the "key-list".  The test returns true if the annotation
   (of the specified type) exists and its value matches any of the keys.

   The default match type is ":is".  The default comparator is "i;ascii-
   casemap".

   The capability string for use with the require command is
   "mboxmetadata".

   Note that access to annotations starting with the /private prefix
   MUST only be done as the user in whose context the Sieve script runs.

   Example: The following example assumes that the Sieve engine also
   supports the "vacation" [VACATION] extension.  However this extension
   is not required in order to implement the "mboxmetadata" extension.

       require ["mboxmetadata", "vacation"];

       if metadata :is "INBOX"
          "/private/vendor/vendor.isode/auto-replies" "on" {

           vacation text:
       I'm away on holidays till March 2009.
       Expect a delay.
       .
       }

3.4.  Test metadata_exists

   Usage:  metadata_exists <mailbox: string> <annotation-names: string-
           list>

   The "metadata_exists" test is true if all of the annotations listed
   in the annotation-names argument exist (have non NIL value) for the
   specified mailbox.

   The capability string for use with the require command is
   "mboxmetadata".


4.  servermetadata Sieve extension

4.1.  Test server_metadata

   Usage:  server_metadata [MATCH-TYPE] [COMPARATOR]
           <annotation-name: string> <key-list: string-list>

   This test retrieves the value of the server annotation "annotation-
   name" [METADATA].  The retrieved value is compared to the "key-list".
   The test returns true if the annotation (of the specified type)
   exists and its value matches any of the keys.

   The default match type is ":is".  The default comparator is "i;ascii-
   casemap".

   The capability string for use with the require command is
   "servermetadata".

   Note that access to annotations starting with the /private prefix
   MUST only be done as the user in whose context the Sieve script runs.

   Example: The following example assumes that the Sieve engine also
   supports "variables" [Variables] and "enotify" [NOTIFY] and
   "envelope" [SIEVE] extensions.  However these extensions are not

   required in order to implement the "servermetadata".

       require ["enotify", "servermetadata", "variables", "envelope"];

       if server_metadata :matches
          "/private/vendor/vendor.isode/notification-uri" "*" {
           set "notif_uri" "${0}";
       }

       if not string :is "${notif_uri}" "none" {
           # :matches is used to get the MAIL FROM address
           if envelope :all :matches "from" "*" {
               set "env_from" " [really: ${1}]";
           }

           # :matches is used to get the value of the Subject header
           if header :matches "Subject" "*" {
               set "subject" "${1}";
           }

           # :matches is used to get the address from the From header
           if address :matches :all "from" "*" {
               set "from_addr" "${1}";
           }

           notify :message "${from_addr}${env_from}: ${subject}"
                  "${notif_uri}";
       }

4.2.  Test server_metadata_exists

   Usage:  server_metadata_exists
           <annotation-names: string-list>

   The "server_metadata_exists" test is true if server annotations with
   names listed in the annotation-names argument exist.  All of the
   annotations must exist or the test is false.

   The capability string for use with the require command is
   "servermetadata".


5.  Security Considerations

   Extensions defined in this document deliberately don't provide a way
   to modify per-user (per-server) or per-mailbox data.

   A failure to retrieve data due to server storing annotations being

   down or otherwise inaccessible may alter the result of Sieve
   processing.  So implementations SHOULD treat temporary failures to
   retrieve annotations in the same manner they would treat temporary
   failures to retrieve the whole Sieve script.

   Protocols/APIs used to retrieve annotations MUST provide the same
   level of confidentiality as protocols/APIs used to retrieve Sieve
   scripts.

   Sieve extensions:
