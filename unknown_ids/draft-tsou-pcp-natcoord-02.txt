   Using PCP To Coordinate Between the CGN and Home Gateway Via Port

Abstract

   Consider a situation where a subscriber's packets are subject to two
   levels of NAT, with both NATs operating under the control of the ISP.
   An example of this would be a NATing Home Gateway forwarding packets
   to a Large Scale NAT.  This memo proposes that advantage be taken of
   the presence of the second NAT, to offload the burden on the Large
   Scale NAT by delegation to the Home Gateway.  Enhancements to the
   Port Control Protocol are specified to achieve this.  The proposed
   solution applies also for DS-Lite where the AFTR offloads it NAT to
   the B4 element.

Internet-Draft   NAT Coordination Using Port Allocation        July 2011


1.  Application Scenario

   A Large Scale NAT (LSN) is responsible for translating source
   addresses and ports for packets passing into and out of the provider
   network.  Especially for large scale service providers, one LSN may
   need to support at least tens of thousands of customers, resulting in
   heavy processing requirements for the LSN.

   In some broadband scenarios an additional NAT is present at the edge
   of the customer network.  For convenience we will call this the Home
   Gateway.  The load on the LSN could be reduced if address and port
   translation were actually done at the Home Gateway.  Achieving such
   an outcome would require coordination between the two devices.  This
   memo makes a detailed proposal for the required coordination
   mechanism.


2.  Proposed Solution

2.1.  Delegation of Port Sets

   The basic proposal made in this memo is to provide the means for the
   Home Gateway to request that the LSN delegate to it a set of ports
   and optionally an external address that will be associated with those
   ports.  It is proposed to use the Port Control Protocol (PCP)
   [ID.port-control-protocol] to achieve this.  The procedure is
   illustrated in Figure 1.

      The LSN allocation of port sets MAY take into account the advice
      given in [ID.behave-natx4-log-reduction].

      [Open Issue: if we want to make the port sets discontinuous, we
      must either allow negotiation of the algorithm or parameters of
      that algorithm for determining the complete set from a given
      starting point, or specify it here.  Specifying it all here is
      probably counter-productive, given that this is a security measure
      to make port guessing harder.]

                 Figure 1: Acquiring a Delegated Port Set

   If the Home Gateway allocates all of the ports that have been
   delegated to it for a given protocol, it MAY send a request to the
   LSN for another delegated set of ports.  If the LSN satisfies that
   request, the Home Gateway MUST release the additional set as soon as
   possible.  To achieve this, the Home Gateway May follow a policy for
   allocation of additional ports to flows, that has the same effect as
   searching for "free" ports in the port sets in the order in which
   they were delegated to the Home Gateway.  A port SHOULD be considered
   "free" if no traffic has been observed through it for the timeout
   interval specified for the protocol concerned, as discussed in
   [ID.behave-natx4-log-reduction], or if the Home Gateway knows through
   other means (e.g., host reboot) that it is no longer in use.

2.2.  Packet Processing At the Home Gateway and LSN

   The Home Gateway maps outgoing flows to the delegated ports.  If an
   external address was received it uses that for the source address;
   otherwise it retains the private address of the Home Gateway as the
   source address.

      The procedures are more complicated, of course, if the IP version
      running externally to the LSN is different from the IP version
      running between the Home Gateway and the LSN, since the
      destination address also has to be translated.  The details depend
      on the particular transition mechanism in use, and are left as an
      exercise for the reader.

   If the private address is retained, the LSN recognizes it from the
   original delegation request and changes the source address but not
   the port before forwarding the packet.  If the external public
   address was used, the LSN is not useful and another device may be
   needed to allocate the port set.

Internet-Draft   NAT Coordination Using Port Allocation        July 2011


   In the reverse direction, the LSN recognizes the public destination
   address and port of an incoming packet as belonging to a delegated
   set for the Home Gateway.  It translates the destination address, if
   necessary, leaving the destination port unchanged.  The Home Gateway
   translates the destination port and address to the corresponding
   values in the customer network and forwards the packet in turn.

2.3.  Proposed Enhancements To and Usage Of the Port Control Protocol

   This document proposes the following new option for MAP opcodes:
   PORT_SET_REQUESTED.

      option number: to be allocated

      is valid for OpCodes: MAP44, MAP64, MAP46, or MAP66

      is included in responses: MUST

      has length: 0 in requests, 4 in successful responses.  [As
      mentioned above, if non-consecutive sets of ports are allocated,
      we may want to add parameters of the algorithm for deriving the
      complete set from the initial value provided in the "assigned
      external port" field of the response.]

      may appear more than once: no

   When constructing a PCP request with the PORT_SET_REQUESTED option,
   the client MUST set the "internal port" field of the request to zero.
   If requesting a new set of delegated ports, the client MAY set the
   "requested external port" field to a non-zero value.  If releasing a
   set of delegated ports (i.e., by setting the "Requested lifetime"
   field to zero), the client MUST set the "requested external port"
   field to the value of the "assigned external port" field of the
   earlier response from the server.  The remaining fields of the PCP
   request MUST be set as directed by [ID.port-control-protocol]

   [Open issue: for a release, should the PORT_SET_REQUESTED option have
   the same contents as it had in the earlier response?]

   Upon receiving a PCP request with the PORT_SET_REQUESTED option, the
   server MAY reject it using return codes 151 - NOT_AUTHORIZED, or 152
   - USER_EX_QUOTA.  In this case, the PORT_SET_REQUESTED option in the
   response MUST have zero length (no data).  If the server chooses to
   honour the request, it MUST place the value of the first port in the
   assigned set in the "assigned external port" field of the response.
   It MUST set the length of the PORT_SET_REQUESTED option in the
   response to 4, and MUST provide the number of ports in the delegated
   set as the value of the option.

3.  Port Range Option

   The Port_Range option is used to specify one set of ports (contiguous
   or not contiguous) pertaining to a given IP address.  The starting
   point of the ports and the number of delegated ports are used to
   infer a set of allowed port values.

Appendix A.  NAT By-pass PCP

A.1.  Introduction

   This section defines a new PCP option denoted NAT by-pass option.
   The purpose of this option is to instruct a PCP- controlled device to
   not envoke NAT operation on a set of flows destined to a given device
   located behind the PCP-controlled device.

A.1.1.  Use Cases

   PCP can be used to control an upstream device to achieve the
   following goals:

   1.  A plain (i.e., a non-shared) IP address can be assigned to a
       given subscriber because the subscriber subscribed to a service
       which uses a protocol that don't embed a transport number or
       because the NAT is the only deployed platform to manage IP
       addresses.

   2.  An application (e.g., sensor) does not need to listen to a whole
       range of ports available on a given IP address.  Only a limited

       set of ports are used to bind its running services.  For such
       devices, the external port(s) and IP address can be delegated to
       that application and therefore avoid enforcing NAT in the network
       side for its associated flows.  The NAT in the PCP- controlled
       device should be bypassed.

   3.  A device able to restrict its source ports can be delegated an
       external port restricted IP address.  The PCP- controlled device
       should be instructed to by-pass the NAT when handling flows
       destined/issued to that device.

A.1.2.  Scope

   As currently defined in PCP Base document, PCP is unable to instruct
   a PCP-controlled device to de-activate the NAT for a given customer,
   given flows, etc.

   This document defines new PCP options which are meant to instruct a
   PCP-controlled device to by-pass the NAT function whenever required.

A.2.  NAT Bypass PCP Option

   This option (Figure 3) is used by a PCP Client to indicate to the PCP
   Server to not apply any NAT operation to a corresponding binding.

   o  purpose: A PCP Client inserts this option in a PCP request to
      indicate to the PCP Server to not apply the NAT function.  The NAT

   o  length:The length MUST be set to 0.

   o  may appear in:request

   o  maximum occurrences:none

   A PCP Client inserts this option in a PCP request to indicate to the
   PCP Server to not apply the NAT function.  The NAT is then by-passed
   in the PCP-controlled device.

   A PCP Server which supports the NAT by-pass feature MUST include this
   option in its response to the requesting PCP Client.  In particular,
   when the PCP Server does not include this option in its response, the
   PCP Client should deduce that the NAT will be enforced in the PCP-
   controlled device; a NAT will be then enforced in the PCP-controlled
   device.

   The NAT bypass feature can be associated with a plain IP address.  In
   such case, a full external IP address is returned to the requesting
   PCP Client.  The client is then able to use all ports associated with
   that IP address (i.e., without any restriction).  Furthermore, this
   "full" address can be used to access services which do not rely on
   protocols embedding a port number (e.g., some IPsec modes).

   In some cases, the PCP Client can request the by-pass of the NAT but
   without requiring a full IP address (e.g., for the use cases
   described in bullet 2 and 3 of Appendix A.1.1).  In such scenario, in
   addition to the NAT by-pass option, the PCP Client includes in its
   PCP request a Port Set Option (Appendix A.3).  More information about
   this option is provided hereafter.

   The requested lifetime in the PCP MAP request is set to the available
   lifetime of the port set.  If the lifetime is set to zero, it means
   that the requested port set should be deleted.  Internal port,
   external port and the external address are all invalid.

A.3.  Port Set Option

   This option (Figure 4) is used to indicate a request for a contiguous
   port set.  This option conveys the length of the requested ports set.
   It is up to the PCP Server to decide whether the request will be
   satisfied or not.  In particular, the PCP Server may discard the
   request or accept to assign a port range with a length distinct than
   the one requested by the PCP Client.  The PCP Server can assign a
   bigger or shorter ports set compared to is actually requested by a
   PCP Client.

   If the PCP Server supports the ability to delegate a set of ports to

   This option:

   o  name: Port Set Length option

   o  number: TBA

   o  purpose: This option is used to indicate a request for a
      contiguous port set.  This option indicates the length of the
      requested ports set.

   o  is valid for OpCodes:all.

   o  length:The length MUST be set to 1.

   o  may appear in:request

   o  maximum occurrences:none

   If the PCP Server is configured to assign port ranges, it should use
   the External Port Set option (Appendix A.4) in its response to convey
   a range of port to a requesting PCP Client.

A.4.  External Port Set

   This option is used to enclose contiguous ports set in a PCP message
   sent by the PCP Server to a requesting Client.  This option may be
   included in a PCP response to delegate a set of ports associated with
   the same external IP address.

   As described in [ID.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues] , a bulk
   of incoming ports can be reserved as a centralized resource shared by
   all subscribers using a given restricted IPv4 address.  In order to
   distribute incoming ports as scattered as possible among subscribers
   sharing the same restricted IPv4 address, other than allocating a
   continuous range of ports to per subscriber, a solution to distribute
   bulks of non-continuous ports among subscribers, which also takes
   port randomization of CPE NAT into account, because port
   randomization is one protection among others against blind attacks,
   is elaborated thereby.

   On every restricted IPv4 address, according to port set size N,
   log2(N)bits are randomly chose as subscribers identification bits(s
   bit) among 1st and 16th bits.  Take a sharing ration 1:32 for
   example, Figure 4 shows an example of 5bits (2nd, 5th, 7th, 9th,
   11th) being chose as s bit.

                                 address).

   Subscriber ID pattern is then formed by setting all the s bits to 1
   and other trivial bits to 0.  Figure 5 illustrates an example of
   subscriber ID pattern which follows the s bit selection of figure 4.
   Note that the subscriber ID pattern can be different, ensured by the
   random s bit selection, per restricted IP address no matter whether
   the sharing ratio varies.

                                 address).

   Subscribers ID value is then assigned by setting subscriber ID
   pattern bits (s bits shown in figure 4) to a unique customer value
   and setting other trivial bits to 1.  An example of subscriber ID
   value, having a subscriber ID pattern shown in the figure 5 and a

   Subscriber ID pattern and subscriber ID value together uniquely
   defines a restricted port set (Non-contiguous port sets or a
   contiguous port range, depends on Subscriber ID pattern and
   subscriber ID value) on a restricted IP address.

   Pseudo-code shown in the figure 7 describes how to use subscriber ID
   pattern and subscriber ID value to implement a random ephemeral port
   selection function within the defined restricted port sets on a
   customer NAT.

      do{
          restricted_next_ephemeral = (random()|subscriber_ID_pattern)
                                      & subscriber_ID_value;
          if(five-tuple is unique)
          return restricted_next_ephemeral;
      }
