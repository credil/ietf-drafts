<abstract>
	<t>This memo describes use cases, requirements, and protocol extensions for using the 
		Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer model for a SIP connection address 
		type in order to provide a mechanism which allows the transport of a SIP URI within 
		the SDP connection line, for use when the actual IP addresses are not known at 
		offer/answer time.
	</t>
</abstract>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

	<t>There are different scenarios in which a device needs to establish a media session which 
		is not terminated locally at the establishing device, but at a different entity. 
		Such an entity can for example be a TV set, which shows the video portion of a 
		multimedia phone call, whilst the voice portion is still handled by the local phone, 
		which acts as the controller of the session. Other scenarios require that a device can 
		redirect parts of a session towards a specific media server in the network, e.g. for 
		playing announcements or advertisement to a user.  
	</t>
	<t>When the controlling device has access to the IP address of the entity to which it wants to 
		redirect the media stream, existing SDP capabilities are sufficient (simply include 
		those IP addresses in the SDP exchange). However, in some scenarios it is not guaranteed 
		that the controlling device has access to this IP address. In some cases the address of 
		the related entity is only known as a URI, e.g. a SIP URI.
	</t>

<section anchor="conv" title="Conventions Used in this Document">
	<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", 
		"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
		in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

</section>

<section anchor="req" title="Requirements">

	<t>This section presents the general requirements that are specific for 
		the establishment of the collaborative session:
	</t>

	<t><list style='format REQ-%d:'>
		<t>a mechanism that allows a device to redirect a local media stream 
			to a dedicated media server within the network (e.g. a streaming 
			server or a TV set), where only a SIP / SIPS URI of the media server 
			is known to the device, i.e. no IP address is known. 
		</t>

		<t>a mechanism that allows two or more devices to find out whether the remote 
			device supports SIP / SIPS URI addressing of SDP media streams.
		</t>

	</list></t>

</section>

<section anchor="overview" title="Overview of Operation">

	<t>The mechanism defined in this memo extends SDP and allows describing the transport of a 
		SIP URI within connection line. New tokens are registered in the "C=" 
		lines to be able to describe a SIP URI. These SDP extensions are described in Section 5.2.
	</t>

	<section anchor="example" title="Example">
		<t>In this example, Alice (sip:alice@example1.net) calls Bob (sip:bob@example-remote.net).
			Alice wants to establish two different media streams:
		</t>

		<t><list style='numbers'>
			<t>a voice media stream from Alice's device, 
				registered with IP address 192.0.2.5
			</t>
			<t>a video media stream from Anna's device, 
				of which Alice only knows the SIP address sip:anna@example2.net
			</t>
		</list></t>

		<t>In order to achieve this, Alice needs to indicate the following indications in the SDP:

		<t>This section provides the syntax and semantics of the extensions required for 
			providing a description in SDP of audio or video media streams which are 
			established at an entity of which only the SIP address is available.
		</t>

		<section anchor="conndata" title="Connection Data">

			<t>According to SDP [RFC4566], the connection data line in SDP has the following 
				syntax:
			</t>

			<t>     c=&lt;nettype&gt; &lt;addrtype&gt; &lt;connection-address&gt;
			</t>

			<t>Where &lt;nettype&gt; indicates the network type, &lt;addrtype&gt; indicates the   
				address type, and the &lt;connection-address&gt; is the connection address, 
				which is dependent on the address type.
			</t>

			<t>At the moment, the only network type defined is "IN", which indicates 
				Internet network type. The address types "IP4" and "IP6" indicate the 
				type of IP addresses.
			</t>

			<t>This memo defines a new network type for describing a SIP-based 
				telecommunication infrastructure.

			<t>Using the mechanisms described in SDP Capability Negotiation Framework

				(SDP media capabilities Negotiation[I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-media-capabilities]
				and SDP MiscellaneousCapabilities [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-misc-cap]) it is 
				possible to construct an SDP offer where audio and video media can be 
				offered using either an IP address or a SIP URI.
