      EDNS0 Option for Indicating AAAA Record Synthesis and Format
               draft-korhonen-edns0-synthesis-flag-01.txt

Abstract

   Advanced hosts and applications benefit of the knowledge of an IPv6
   address, AAAA record, synthesis taking place in the network.  This
   draft proposes new ENDS0 option for communicating the synthesis is
   taking place, used address format, and the IPv6 prefix and suffix
   used by the DNS64.  The communicated information enables hosts to
   perform local IPv6 address synthesis.

Internet-Draft            EDNS0 synthesis flags           September 2010


1.  Introduction

   As the networks transition to IPv6, connectivity to IPv4-only domains
   have to be provided.  NAT64 [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] and
   DNS64 [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] technologies can be utilized to make
   IPv4-only peers look like being reachable over IPv6.  The DNS64
   utilizes IPv6 address synthesis to create local IPv6 presentations of
   peers having only IPv4 addresses.  Applications utilizing DNS for
   resolving peers' IPv6 addresses can work seamlessly through protocol
   translation taking place at NAT64.

   The DNS64 cannot serve applications not using DNS, such as those
   receiving IPv4 addresses as referrals.  Such applications could
   nevertheless be able to work through NAT64, provided they are able to
   create locally valid IPv6 presentations of peers' IPv4 addresses.

   This document describes a method for advanced applications to learn
   the information required to perform local IPv6 address synthesis.

   The knowledge of IPv6 address synthesizing taking place may also be
   useful if DNS64 is present in dual-stack network access.  In such
   cases hosts may choose to use IPv4 addresses instead of synthesized
   IPv6 addresses, and hence avoid traversal through NAT64.


2.  Requirements and Terminology

2.1.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  EDNS0 option for indicating address synthesis

   The mechanism for informing AAAA record synthesis taking place and
   the used addressing format is communicated in an EDNS0 option in a
   DNS response.  The option has three bits indicating the formats
   described in [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].  The option and bits
   are structured as follows:

    OPTION-CODE    (Assigned by IANA)

    OPTION-LENGTH  2 (Length of payload in octets)

    Possible values for SY-bits are:

             000 reserved
             001 prefix length /32
             010 prefix length /40
             011 prefix length /48
             100 prefix length /56
             101 prefix length /64
             110 prefix length /96
             111 address is not synthesized

    Reserved       Initialized to zero

                                 Figure 1

   The prefix length corresponds to the address formats documented in
   "IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators document"
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] section 2.2.

   Absence of EDNS0 option means that either no synthesis took place or
   the DNS64 does not support this specification.  Either way, when the
   EDNS0 option is missing, the host cannot conclude for certain whether
   the AAAA response was synthesized or not.  The host may additionally
   utilize method described in
   [I-D.savolainen-heuristic-nat64-discovery].


4.  Host behavior

   A host requiring information for local IPv6 address synthesis or
   NAT64 avoidance shall send a DNS query for AAAA record of a well-
   known IPv4-only fully qualified domain name.  This well-known name
   does not have to be in global DNS system.  It is enough that DNS64
   recognizes the name and replies to it.

Internet-Draft            EDNS0 synthesis flags           September 2010


   The host may query for well-known name, for example, at the moment
   the host is configured an IPv6 address of a DNS server.  This may
   also happen at the time first DNS query for AAAA record is initiated.

   If a host receives negative reply, it learns there are no NAT64 in
   the network.

   If a host receives AAAA reply, it knows the network is utilizing IPv6
   address synthesis.  If the received IPv6 address has well-known
   prefix, the host can use that information for local IPv6 address
   synthesis.  If the prefix is not the well-known, the host reads the
   flag values on the ENDS0 option to learn the used address format, and
   with that information fetches from the received IPv6 address the
   information used by the network for IPv6 address synthesis (prefix,
   suffix, u-bit).

   The information required for local IPv6 address synthesis should be
   made available for applications to utilize.


5.  Security Considerations

   No security considerations have been identified.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should define a name and an IPv4 address for a well-known IPv4-
   only name.

   IANA should allocate new OPTION-CODE for this option.


7.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to acknowledge Andrew Sullivan for presenting
   general idea of ENDS0 option and SY-bit in behave WG mailing list.
