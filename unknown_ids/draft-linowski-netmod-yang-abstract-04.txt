               Extending YANG with Language Abstractions
                 draft-linowski-netmod-yang-abstract-04

Abstract

   YANG - the NETCONF Data Modeling Language - supports modeling of a
   tree of data elements that represent the configuration and runtime
   status of a particular network element managed via NETCONF.  This
   memo suggests to enhance YANG with supplementary modeling features
   and language abstractions with the aim to improve the model
   extensibility and reuse.

Internet-Draft         YANG Language Abstractions           October 2010


1.  Introduction

   YANG - the NETCONF Data Modeling Language ([RFC6020]) - supports
   modeling of a tree of data elements that represent the configuration
   and runtime status of a particular network element managed via
   NETCONF.  This document defines extensions for the modeling language
   YANG as new language statements, which introduce language
   abstractions to improve the model extensibility and reuse.  A model
   example from an actual network management system is given to
   highlight the value of proposed language extensions, especially class
   inheritance and recursiveness.  The language extensions defined in
   this document have been implemented with two open source tools.
   These tools have been used to validate the model examples through the
   document.

1.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, [RFC2119].

1.2.  Motivation

   o  Many systems today have a management information base that in
      effect is organized as a tree build of recursively nested
      container nodes.  For example, the physical resources in the
      ENTITY-MIB conceptually form a containment tree.  The index
      entPhysicalContainedIn points to the containing entity in a flat
      list.  The ability to represent nested, recursive data structures
      of arbitrary depth would enable the representation of the primary
      containment hierarchy of physical entities as a node tree in the
      server MIB and in the NETCONF payload.

   o  A manager scanning the network in order to update the state of an
      inventory management system might be only interested in data
      structures that represent a specific type of hardware.  Such a
      manager would then look for entities that are of this specific
      type, including those that are an extension or specialization of
      this type.  To support this use case, it is helpful to bear the
      corresponding type information within the data structures, which
      describe the network element hardware.

   o  A system that is managing network elements is concerned e.g. with
      managed objects of type "plug-in modules" that have a name, a
      version and an activation state.  In this context, it is useful to
      define the "plug-in module" as a concept that is supposed to be
      further detailed and extended by additional concrete model



Linowski, et al.         Expires April 22, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         YANG Language Abstractions           October 2010


      elements.  In order to realize such a system, it is worth to model
      abstract entities, which enable reuse and ease concrete
      refinements of that abstract entity in a second step.

   o  As particular network elements have specific type of components
      that need to be managed (OS images, plug-in modules, equipment,
      etc.), it should be possible to define concrete types, which
      describe the managed object precisely.  By using type-safe
      extensions of basic concepts a system in the manager role can
      safely and explicitly determine that e.g. the "equipment" is
      actually of type "network card".

   o  Currently different SDOs are working on the harmonization of their
      management information models.  Often a model mapping or
      transformation between systems becomes necessary.  The
      harmonization of the models is done e.g. by mapping of the two
      models on object level or integrating an object hierarchy into an
      existing information model.  Extending YANG with language
      abstractions can simplify on the one hand the adoption of IETF
      resource models by other SDOs and facilitate the alignment with
      other SDO's resource models (e.g.  TM Forum SID).  The proposed
      YANG extensions can on the other hand enable the utilization of
      YANG modeling language in other SDOs, which are used to model
      complex management systems in a top-down manner and use high-level
      language features frequently.

   This memo specifies additional modeling features for the YANG
   language in the area of structured model abstractions, typed
   references as well as recursive data structures and discusses how
   these new features can improve the modeling capabilities of YANG.

   Section 1.5.1 contains a physical resource model, which deals with
   some of the modeling challenges illustrated above.  Section 1.5.2
   gives an example, which uses the base classes defined in the physical
   resource model and derives a model for physical entities defined in
   Entity MIB".

1.3.  Modeling Improvements with Language Abstractions

   Complex Types and Typed Instance Identifiers provide various
   technical improvements on modeling level:

   o  In case the model of a system that should be managed with NETCONF
      makes use of inheritance, complex types enable an almost one-to-
      one mapping between the classes in the original model and the YANG
      module.

   o  Typed instance identifiers allow representing associations between
      the concepts in a type-safe way to prevent type errors caused by
      referring to data nodes of incompatible types.  This avoids
      referring to a particular location in the MIB, which is not
      mandated by the domain model.

   o  Complex types allow defining complete, self-contained type
      definitions.  It is not necessary to explicitly add a key
      statement to lists, which use a grouping defining the data nodes.

   o  Complex types simplify concept refinement by extending a base
      complex type and make it superfluous to represent concept
      refinements with workarounds such as huge choice-statements with
      complex branches.

   o  Abstract complex types ensure correct usage of abstract concepts
      by enforcing the refinement of common set of properties before
      instantiation.

   o  Complex types allow defining recursive structures.  This enables
      to represent complex structures of arbitrary depth by nesting
      instances of basic complex types that may contain themselves.

   o  Complex types avoid introducing meta-data types (e.g. type code
      enumerations) and meta-data leafs (e.g. leafs containing a type
      code) to indicate, which concrete type of object is actually
      represented by a generic container in the MIB.  This also avoids
      to explicitly rule out illegal use of sub-type specific properties
      in generic containers.

   o  Complex type instances include the type information in the NETCONF
      payload.  This allows to determine the actual type of an instance
      during the NETCONF payload parsing and avoids the use of
      additional leafs in the model, which provide the type information
      as content.

   o  Complex types may be declared explicitly as optional features,
      which is not possible when the actual type of an entity
      represented by a generic container is indicated with a type code
      enumeration.

   Appendix C 'Example YANG Module for the IPFIX/PSAMP Model' lists
   technical improvements for modeling with Complex Types and Typed
   Instance Identifiers and exemplifies the usage of the proposed YANG
   extensions based on the IPFIX/PSAMP configuration model in
   [IPFIXCONF].

1.4.  Design Approach

   The proposed additional features for YANG in this memo are designed
   to reuse existing YANG statements whenever possible.  Additional
   semantics is expressed by an extension that is supposed to be used as
   a substatement of an existing statement.

   The proposed features don't change the semantics of models that are
   valid with respect to the YANG specification [RFC6020].

1.5.  Modeling Resource Models with YANG

1.5.1.  Example of a Physical Network Resource Model

   The diagram below depicts a portion of an information model for
   manageable network resources used in an actual network management
   system.

   Note: The referenced model (UDM, Unified Data Model) is based on key
   resource modelling concepts from [SID V8] and is compliant with
   selected parts of SID Resource Abstract Business Entities domain
   ([UDM]).

   The class diagram in Figure 1 and the according YANG module excerpt
   focus on basic resource ("Resource" and the distinction between
   logical- and physical resources) and hardware abstractions
   ("Hardware", "Equipment", and "EquipmentHolder").  Some class
   attributes were omitted to achieve decent readability.

   Since this model is an abstraction of network element specific MIB
   topologies, modeling it with YANG creates some challenges.  Some of
   these challenges and how they can be addressed with complex types are
   explained below:

   o  Modeling of abstract concepts: Classes like "Resource" represent
      concepts that primarily serve as a base class for derived classes.
      With complex types, such an abstract concept could be represented
      by an abstract complex type (see "complex-type extension
      statement" and "abstract extension statement").

   o  Class Inheritance: Information models for complex management
      domains often use class inheritance to create specialized classes



Linowski, et al.         Expires April 22, 2011                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         YANG Language Abstractions           October 2010


      like "PhysicalConnector" from a more generic base class (here
      "Hardware"), which itself might inherit from another base class
      ("PhysicalResource") etc.  Complex types allow creating enhanced
      versions of an existing (abstract or concrete) base type via an
      extension (see "extends extension statement").

   o  Recursive containment: In order to specify containment hierarchies
      models frequently contain different aggregation associations, in
      which the target (contained element) is either the containing
      class itself or a base class of the containing class.  In the
      model above, the recursive containment of "EquipmentHolder" is an
      example of such a relationship.  Complex types support such a
      containment by using a complex type (or one of its ancestor types)
      as type of an instance or instance list that is part of its
      definition (see "instance(-list) extension statement").

   o  Reference relationships: A key requirement on large models for
      network domains with many related managed objects is the
      association between classes that represent an essential
      relationship between instances of such a class.  For example, the
      relationship between "PhysicalLink" and "Hardware" tells which
      physical link is connecting which hardware resources.  It is
      important to notice that this kind of relationships do not mandate
      any particular location of the two connected hardware instances in
      any MIB.  Such containment agnostic relationships can be
      represented by a typed instance identifier that embodies one
      direction of such an association (see "Typed instance
      identifiers").

   The YANG module excerpt below shows how the challenges listed above
   can be addressed by the Complex Types extension (module import prefix
   "ct:").  The complete YANG module for the physical resource model in
   Figure 1 can be found in Appendix B: 'YANG Modules for Physical
   Network Resource Model and Hardware Entities Model'.

1.5.2.  Modeling Entity MIB Entries as Physical Resources

   The physical resource module described above can now be used to model
   physical entities as defined in the Entity MIB [RFC4133].  For each
   physical entity class listed in the "PhysicalClass" enumeration, a
   complex type is defined.  Each of these complex types extends the
   most specific complex type already available in the physical resource
   module.  For example, the type "HWModule" extends the complex type
   "Equipment" as a hardware module.  Physical entity properties that
   should be included in a physical entity complex type are combined in
   a grouping, which is then used in each complex type definition of an
   entity.

   This approach has following benefits:

   o  The definition of the complex types for hardware entities becomes
      compact as many of the features can be reused from the basic
      complex type definition.

   o  Physical entities are modeled in a consistent manner as predefined
      concepts are extended.

   o  Entity MIB specific attributes as well as vendor specific
      attributes can be added without having to define separate
      extension data nodes.

2.  Complex Types

2.1.  Definition

   YANG type concept is currently restricted to simple types, e.g.
   restrictions of primitive types, enumerations or union of simple
   types.

   Complex types are types with a rich internal structure, which may be
   composed of substatements defined in Table 1 (e.g. lists, leafs,
   containers, choices).  A new complex type may extend an existing
   complex type.  This allows providing type-safe extensions to existing
   YANG models as instances of the new type.

   Complex types have the following characteristics:

   o  Introduction of new types, as a named, formal description of a
      concrete manageable resource as well as abstract concepts.

   o  Types can be extended, i.e. new types can be defined by
      specializing existing types adding new features.  Instances of
      such an extended type can be used wherever instances of the base
      type may appear.

   o  The type information is made part of the NETCONF payload in case a
      derived type substitutes a base type.  This enables easy and
      efficient consumption of payload elements representing complex
      type instances.

2.2.  complex-type extension statement

   The extension statement "complex-type" is introduced that accepts an
   arbitrary number of node tree defining statements among other common
   YANG statements ("YANG Statements", [RFC6020] Section 7).

                    +------------------+-------------+

                   Table 1: complex-type's substatements

   Complex type definitions may appear at every place, where a grouping
   may be defined.  That includes the module, submodule, rpc, input,
   output, notification, container, and list statements.

   Complex type names populate a distinct namespace.  As with YANG
   groupings, it is possible to define a complex type and a data node
   (e.g. leaf, list, instance statements) with the same name in the same
   scope.  All complex type names defined within a parent node or at the
   top-level of the module or its submodules share the same type
   identifier namespace.  This namespace is scoped to the parent node or
   module.

   A complex type MAY have an instance key.  An instance key is either
   defined with the "key" statement as part of the complex type or is
   inherited from the base complex type.  It is not allowed to define an
   additional key if the base complex type or one of its ancestors
   already defines a key.

   Complex-type definitions do not create nodes in the schema tree.

2.3.  instance extension statement

   The "instance" extension statement is used to instantiate a complex
   type by creating a subtree in the management information node tree.
   The instance statement takes one argument that is the identifier of
   the complex type instance.  It is followed by a block of
   substatements.

   The type of the instance is specified with the mandatory "ct:
   instance-type" substatement.  The type of an instance MUST be a
   complex type.  Common YANG statements may be used as substatements of
   the "instance" statement.  An instance is by default optional.  To
   make an instance mandatory, "mandatory true" has to be applied as
   substatement.

                     Table 2: instance's substatements

   The "instance" and "instance-list" extension statements (see Section
   2.4 "instance-list extension statement") are similar to the existing
   "leaf" and "leaf-list" statements, with the exception that the
   content is composed of subordinate elements according to the
   instantiated complex type.

   It is also possible to add additional data nodes by using the
   according leaf, leaf-list, list, and choice statements etc. as sub-
   statements of the instance declaration.  This is an in-place

   augmentation of the used complex type confined to a complex type
   instantiation (see also Section 2.13 "Using complex types" for
   details on augmenting complex types).

2.4.  instance-list extension statement

   The "instance-list" extension statement is used to instantiate a
   complex type by defining a sequence of subtrees in the management
   information node tree.  In addition, the "instance-list" statement
   takes one argument that is the identifier of the complex type
   instances.  It is followed by a block of substatements.

   The type of the instance is specified with the mandatory "ct:
   instance-type" substatement.  In addition it can be defined how often
   an instance may appear in the schema tree by using the min-elements
   and max-elements substatements.  Common YANG statements may be used
   as substatements of the "instance-list" statement.

   In analogy to "instance" statement, sub-statement like "list",
   "choice", leaf" etc.  MAY be used to augment the instance list
   elements at the root level with additional data nodes.

   In case the instance list represents configuration data, the used
   complex type of an instance MUST have an instance key.

   Instances as well as instance lists may appear as arguments of the

   using the "extends" extension statement.  The keyword "extends" MAY
   occur as substatement of the "complex-type" extension statement.  The
   argument of the "complex-type" extension statement refers to the base
   complex type via its name.  In case a complex type represents
   configuration data (the default), it MUST have a key, otherwise it
   MAY have a key.  A key is either defined with the key statement as
   part of the complex type or is inherited from the base complex type.

2.6.  abstract extension statement

   Complex types may be declared to be abstract by using the "abstract"
   extension statement.  An abstract complex type cannot be
   instantiated, meaning it cannot appear as most specific type of an
   instance in NETCONF payload.  In case an abstract type extends a base
   type, the base complex type MUST be also abstract.  By default,
   complex types are not abstract.

   The abstract complex type serves only as a base type for derived
   concrete complex types and cannot be used as a type for an instance
   in NETCONF payload.

   The "abstract" extension statement takes a single string argument,
   which is either "true" or "false".  In case a "complex-type"
   statement does not contain an "abstract" statement as substatement,
   the default is "false".  The "abstract" statement does not support
   any substatements.

2.7.  XML Encoding Rules

   An "instance" node is encoded as an XML element, where an "instance-
   list" node is encoded as a series of XML elements.  The XML element
   name is the "instance" respectively "instance-list" identifier, and
   its XML namespace is the module's XML namespace.

   Instance child nodes are encoded as subelements of the instance XML
   element.  Subelements representing child nodes defined in the same
   complex type may appear in any order.  However child nodes of an
   extending complex type follow the child nodes of the extended complex
   type.  As such, the XML encoding of lists is similar to the encoding
   of containers and lists in YANG.

   Instance key nodes are encoded as subelements of the instance XML
   element.  Instance key nodes must appear in the same order as they
   are defined within the "key" statement of the according complex type
   definition and precede all other nodes defined in the same complex
   type.  I.e. if key nodes are defined in an extending complex type,
   XML elements representing key data precede all other XML elements
   representing child nodes.  On the other hand XML elements
   representing key data follow the XML elements representing data nodes
   of the base type.

   The type of actual complex type instance is encoded in a type
   element, which is put in front of all instance child elements,
   including key nodes, as described in Section 2.8 ("Type Encoding
   Rules").

   The proposed XML encoding rules conform to the YANG XML encoding
   rules in [RFC6020].  Compared to YANG, enabling key definitions in
   derived hierarchies is a new feature introduced with the complex
   types extension.  As a new language feature complex types introduce
   also a new payload entry for the instance type identifier.

   Based on our implementation experience, the proposed XML encoding
   rules support consistent mapping of YANG models with complex types to
   XML Schema using XML complex types.

2.8.  Type Encoding Rules

   In order to encode the type of an instance in NETCONF payload, XML
   elements named "type" belonging to the XML namespace
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-complex-type-instance" are added to
   the serialized form of instance and instance-list nodes in the
   payload.  The suggested namespace prefix is "cti".  The "cti:type"
   XML elements are inserted before the serialized form of all members
   that have been declared in the according complex type definition.



Linowski, et al.         Expires April 22, 2011                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft         YANG Language Abstractions           October 2010


   The "cti:type" element is inserted for each type in the extension
   chain to the actual type of the instance (most specific last).  Each
   type name includes its corresponding namespace.

   The type of a complex type instance MUST be encoded in the reply to
   NETCONF <get> and <get-config> operations, and in the payload of
   NETCONF <edit-config> operation if the operation is "create" or
   "replace".  The type of the instance MUST also be specified in case
   <copy-config> is used to export a configuration to a resource
   addressed with an URI.  The type of the instance has to be specified
   in user defined RPC's.

   The type of the instance MAY be specified in case the operation is
   "merge" (either because this is explicitly specified or no operation
   attribute is provided).

   In case the node already exists in the target configuration and the
   type attribute (type of a complex type instance) is specified but
   differs from the data in the target, an <rpc-error> element is
   returned with an <error-app-tag> value of "wrong-complex-type".  In
   case no such element is present in the target configuration but the
   type attribute is missing in the configuration data, an <rpc-error>
   element is returned with an <error-tag> value of "missing-attribute".

   The type MUST NOT be specified in case the operation is "delete".

2.9.  Extension and Feature Definition Module

   The module below contains all YANG extension definitions for complex
   types and typed instance identifiers.  In addition a "complex-type"
   feature is defined, which may be used to provide conditional or
   alternative modeling for depending on the support status of complex
   types in a NETCONF server.  A NETCONF server that supports the
   complex types modeling features and the XML encoding for complex
   types as defined in this document MUST advertise this as a feature.
   This is done by including the feature name "complex-types" into the
   feature parameter list as part of the NETCONF <hello> message as
   described in Section 5.6.4 in [RFC6020].

2.12.  Update Rules for Modules Using Complex Types

   In addition to the module update rules specified in Section 10 in
   [RFC6020], modules that define complex-types, instances of complex
   types and typed instance identifiers must obey following rules:

   o  New complex types MAY be added.

   o  A new complex type MAY extend an existing complex type.

   o  New data definition statements MAY be added to a complex type only
      if:

      *  they are not mandatory or

      *  they are not conditionally dependent on a new feature (i.e.,
         have an "if-feature" statement, which refers to a new feature).

   o  The type referred to by the instance-type statement may be changed
      to a type that derives from the original type only if the original
      type does not represent configuration data.

2.13.  Using Complex Types

   All data nodes defined inside a complex type reside in the complex
   type namespace, which is their parent node namespace.

2.13.1.  Overriding Complex Type Data Nodes

   It is not allowed to override a data node inherited from a base type.
   I.e. it is an error if a type "base" with a leaf named "foo" is
   extended by another complex type ("derived") with a leaf named "foo"
   in the same module.  In case they are derived in different modules,
   there are two distinct "foo" nodes which are mapped to the XML
   namespaces of the module, where the complex types are specified.

   A complex type that extends a basic complex type may use the "refine"
   statement in order to improve an inherited data node.  The target
   node identifier must be qualified by the module prefix to indicate
   clearly, which inherited node is refined.

   The following refinements can be done:

   o  A leaf or choice node may have a default value, or a new default
      value if it already had one

   o  Any node may have a different "description" or "reference" string.




Linowski, et al.         Expires April 22, 2011                [Page 29]

Internet-Draft         YANG Language Abstractions           October 2010


   o  A leaf, anyxml, or choice node may have a "mandatory true"
      statement.  However, it is not allowed to change from "mandatory
      true" to "mandatory false".

   o  A leaf, leaf-list, list, container, or anyxml node may have
      additional "must" expressions.

   o  A list, leaf-list, instance or instance-list node may have a "min-
      elements" statement, if the base type does not have one or one
      with a value that is greater than the minimum value of the base
      type.

   o  A list, leaf-list, instance or instance-list node may have a "max-
      elements" statement, if the base type does not have one or one
      with a value that is smaller than the maximum value of the base
      type.

   It is not allowed to refine complex-type nodes inside instance or
   instance-list statements.

2.13.2.  Augmenting Complex Types

   Augmenting complex types is only allowed if a complex type is
   instantiated in an "instance" or "instance-list" statement.  This
   confines the effect of the augmentation to the location in the schema
   tree, where the augmentation is done.  The argument of the "augment"
   statement MUST be in the descendant form (as defined by the rule
   "descendant-schema-nodeid" in Section 12 in [RFC6020]).

      ct:complex-type Chassis {
              ct:extends EquipmentHolder;
              container chassisInfo {
                     config false;
                     leaf numberOfSlots { type uint16; }
                     leaf occupiedSlots { type uint16; }
                     leaf height {type unit16;}
                     leaf width {type unit16;}
                }
      }

      ct:instance-list chassis {
              type Chassis;
              augment "chassisInfo" {
                     leaf modelId { type string; }
              }
      }

Internet-Draft         YANG Language Abstractions           October 2010


   When augmenting a complex type, only the "container", "leaf", "list",
   "leaf-list", "choice", "instance", "instance-list" and "if-feature"
   statements may be used within the "augment" statement.  The nodes
   added by the augmentation MUST NOT be mandatory nodes.  One or many
   augment statements may not cause the creation of multiple nodes with
   the same name from the same namespace in the target node.

   To achieve less complex modeling this document proposes the
   augmentation of complex type instances without recursion.

2.13.3.  Controlling the Use of Complex Types

   A server might not want to support all complex types defined in a
   supported module.  This issue can be addressed with YANG features as
   follows:

   o  Features are defined that are used inside complex type definitions
      (by using "if-feature" as substatement) to make them optional.  In
      this case such complex types may only be instantiated if the
      feature is supported (advertized as capability in the NETCONF
      <hello> message).

   o  The "deviation" statement may be applied to node trees, which are
      created by "instance" and "instance-list" statements.  In this
      case, only the substatement "deviate not-supported" is allowed.

   o  It is not allowed to apply the deviation statement to node tree
      elements that may occur because of the recursive use of a complex
      type.  Other forms of deviations ("deviate add", "deviate
      replace", "deviate delete") are NOT supported inside node trees
      spanned by "instance" or "instance-list".

   As complex type definitions do not contribute by itself to the data
   node tree, data node declarations inside complex types cannot be
   target of deviations.

   In the example below, client applications are informed that the leaf
   "occupiedSlots" is not supported in the top-level chassis.  However,
   if a chassis contains another chassis, the contained chassis may
   support the leaf informing about the number of occupied slots.


     deviation "/chassis/chassisSpec/occupiedSlots" {
        deviate not-supported;
     }

3.  Typed Instance Identifier

3.1.  Definition

   Typed instance identifier relationships are an addition to the
   relationship types already defined in YANG, where the leafref
   relationship is location dependent, and the instance-identifier does
   not specify to which type of instances the identifier points to.

   A typed instance identifier represents a reference to an instance of
   a complex type without being restricted to a particular location in
   the containment tree.  This is done by using the extension statement
   "instance-type" as a substatement of the existing "type instance
   identifier" statement.

   Typed instance identifiers allow referring to instances of complex
   types that may be located anywhere in the schema tree.  The "type"
   statement plays the role of a restriction that must be fulfilled by
   the target node, which is referred to with the instance identifier.
   The target node MUST be of a particular complex type, either the type
   itself or any type that extends this complex type.

3.2.  instance-type extension statement

   The "instance-type" extension statement specifies the complex type of
   the instance referred by the instance-identifier.  The referred
   instance may also instantiate any complex type that extends the
   specified complex type.

   The instance complex type is identified by the single name argument.
   The referred complex type MUST have a key.  This extension statement
   MUST be used as a substatement of the "type instance-identifier"
   statement.  The "instance-type" extension statement does not support
   any substatements.

3.3.  Typed Instance Identifier Example

   In the example below, a physical link connects an arbitrary number of
   physical ports.  Here typed instance identifiers are used to denote,
   which "PhysicalPort" instances (anywhere in the data tree) are
   connected by a "PhysicalLink".

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers two URIs in the IETF XML registry.  Following
   the format in [RFC3688], the following registrations are requested:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-complex-types
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-complex-type-instance

   Registrant Contact: The NETMOD WG of the IETF.

   XML: N/A, the requested URIs are XML namespaces.

   This document registers one module name in the 'YANG Module Names'
   registry, defined in [RFC6020].


      name: ietf-complex-types

      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-complex-types

      prefix: ct

      RFC: XXXX

   RFC Ed.: Please replace XXXX with actual RFC number and remove this
   note.

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module "complex-types" in this memo defines YANG extensions
   for Complex-types and Typed Instance Identifiers as new language
   statements.

   Complex-types and Typed Instance Identifiers themselves do not have
   any security impact on the Internet.

   The security considerations described throughout [RFC6020] apply here
   as well.

Appendix A.  Change Log

A.1.  03-04

   o  Changed the complex type XML encoding rules so that XML elements
      reprensenting data nodes defined in the same complex type may
      appear in any order.

   o  Used the "ct:" prefix in substatement tables when referring to
      complex type extension statements.

Internet-Draft         YANG Language Abstractions           October 2010


   o  Modeled the IPFIX/PSMAP example based on v-07 of the IPFIX
      configuration draft.  Changed motivation text accordingly.

   o  Minor updates and clarifications in the text.

A.2.  02-03

   o  Added an example based on the physical resource modeling concepts
      of SID.  A simplified class diagram and an excerpt of an according
      YANG module were added in the introduction section.

   o  Changed the example YANG module in the NETCONF payload section to
      be based on the physical resource types defined in the added
      physical resource model.

   o  A second example shows how Entity MIB entries can be modeled as
      physical resources.  The example includes a class diagram and an
      according YANG module excerpt.

   o  The complete YANG modules for both examples were added into the
      appendix.

   o  Changed the complex type encoding rules.

   o  Updated the NETCONF payload example the changed type encoding
      rules and the changed example module.

   o  Changed the augmentation rules for complex types.  Instead of
      using "." as argument in the augment statement, instance and
      instance-list statement may now contain additional data node
      statements.  The substatement tables for the instance and
      instance-list statements were updated accordingly.

   o  Minor updates in the text and examples.

A.3.  01-02

   o  It is no longer allowed to use the "config" statement inside a
      complex type definition.

   o  Complex type can now be defined where a grouping can be defined.
      Complex types have their own namespace.

   o  Explicitly specified which kind of refinements can be applied to
      elements of the base type in the definition of an extending
      complex type.

Internet-Draft         YANG Language Abstractions           October 2010


   o  Confined the use of deviations for complex types to complex type
      instantiations.

   o  Defined augmentation of complex types allowing augmentation only
      during instantiation via an "instance" or "instance-list"
      statement.

   o  Removed leftovers from substatement tables.

   o  Updates and bug-fixes in the examples.

A.4.  00-01

   o  Transformed proposed new YANG statements to YANG extension
      statements (complex-type, element, extends, abstract).

   o  Renamed statement "element" to the extension statement "instance"
      in order to avoid confusion with XML payload elements.

   o  Introduced extension statement "instance-type" as allowing the use
      of the existing "type" statement as substatement in the existing
      "instance-identifier" statement cannot be done with extensions.

   o  Added the complex type extension statement module.

   o  Updated examples to reflect the changes mentioned above.

   o  Added update rules for complex types.

   o  Updated IANA Considerations section.

   o  Added this change log.

   The module below is a variation of the IPFIX/PSAMP configuration
   model, which uses complex types and typed instance identifiers to
   model the concept outlined in [IPFIXCONF].

   When looking at the YANG module with complex types and typed instance
   identifiers, various technical improvements on modeling level become
   apparent.

   o  There is almost a one-to-one mapping between the domain concepts
      introduced in IPFIX and the complex types in the YANG module

   o  All associations between the concepts (which are not containment)
      are represented with typed identifiers.  That avoids having to
      refer to a particular location in the tree, which is not mandated
      by the original model.

   o  It is superfluous to represent concept refinement (class
      inheritance in the original model) with containment in form of
      quite big choice-statements with complex branches.  Instead,
      concept refinement is realized by complex types extending a base
      complex type.

   o  It is unnecessary to introduce metadata identities and leafs (e.g.
      "identity cacheMode" and "leaf cacheMode" in "grouping
      cacheParameters") that just serve the purpose of indicating which
      concrete sub-type of a generic type (modeled as grouping, which
      contains the union of all features of all subtypes) is actually
      represented in the MIB.

   o  Ruling out illegal use of sub-type specific properties (e.g. "leaf
      maxFlows") by using "when" statements that refer to a sub-type
      discriminator is not necessary (e.g. when "../cacheMode !=
      'immediate'").

   o  It is not needed to define properties like the configuration
      status wherever a so called "parameter grouping" is used.  Instead
      those definitions can be put inside the complex-type definition
      itself.

   o  It can be avoided to separating the declaration of the key from
      the related data nodes definitions in a grouping (see use of
      "grouping selectorParameters").

   o  Complex types may be declared as optional features.  If the type
      is indicated with an identity (e.g. "identity immediate"), this is
      not possible, since "if-feature" is not allowed as a substatement
      of "identity".
