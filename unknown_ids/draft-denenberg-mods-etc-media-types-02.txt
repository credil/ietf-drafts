Abstract

   This document specifies Media Types for the following formats: MODS
   (Metadata Object Description Schema), MADS (Metadata Authority
   Description Schema), METS (Metadata Encoding and Transmission
   Standard), MARCXML (MARC21 XML Schema), and the SRU (Search/Retrieve
   via URL Response Format) Protocol response XML schema.  These are all
   XML schemas providing representations of various forms of information
   including metadata and search results.

Internet-Draft       Library of Congress Media Types          April 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Library of Congress, on behalf of and in collaboration with
   various components of the metadata and information retrieval
   community, has issued specifications which define formats for
   representation of various forms of information including metadata and
   search results.  This memo provides information about the Media Types
   associated with several of these formats, all of which are XML
   schemas.

   MODS: Metadata Object Description Schema.  An XML schema for a
      bibliographic element set that may be used for a variety of
      purposes, and particularly for library applications.

   MADS: Metadata Authority Description Schema.  An XML schema for an
      authority element set used to provide metadata about agents
      (people, organizations), events, and terms (topics, geographics,
      genres, etc.).  It is a companion to the MODS Schema.

   METS: Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard.  An XML schema for
      encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata
      regarding objects within a digital library.

   MARCXML MARC21 XML Schema.  An XML schema for the direct XML
      representation of the MARC format (for which there already exists
      a media type, application/marc; see [RFC2220]).  By "direct XML
      representation" we mean that it encodes the actual MARC data
      within XML.  (This is in contrast to MODS: MARC uses codes for its
      element names; MODS represents the same information but uses
      semantically meaningful names while MARCXML uses the MARC codes.)

   SRU: Search/Retrieve via URL Response Format.  An XML schema for the
      SRU response.  SRU is a protocol, and the media type sru+xml
      pertains specifically to the default SRU response.  The SRU
      response may be supplied in any of a number of suitable schemas,
      RSS, ATOM, for example, and the client identifies the desired
      format in the request, hence the need for a media type.  This
      mechanism will be introduced in SRU 2.0; in previous versions
      (that is, all versions to date; 2.0 is in development) all
      responses are supplied in the existing default format, so no media
      type was necessary.  SRU 2.0 is being developed within the
      Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information
      Standards (OASIS).
