     Abstract 

        "Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane 
        Failures," RFC4379, describes procedures for ping and 
        traceroute for LSPs that traverse a Packet Switch Capable 
        (PSC) network. These procedures are known as Label Switched 
        Path Ping (LSP Ping).

        An important implication of using non-PSC nodes in a 
        Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) network is that the LSP Ping solution 
        described in RFC4379 is not applicable to LSPs traversing a 
        non-PSC network. Another important feature introduced by GMPLS 
        is the potential for data and control plane separation with 
        the consequence that LSP Ping procedures for ping and 
        traceroute that rely on in-band propagation of messages cannot 
        be applied. 

        This document describes mechanisms that can be used to detect 
        and  isolate data plane failures in non-PSC GMPLS LSPs. The 
        document also proposes a method to traceroute a GMPLS LSP in 
        PSC or non-PSC networks where the data and control planes are 
        separated. The proposed solutions are based on the Link 
        Management Protocol (LMP) described in RFC4204 and on MPLS LSP 
        Ping [RFC4379].  

        The document is particularly applicable to data plane 
        technologies where the data plane does not otherwise provide 
        the OAM functions (e.g., pre-OTH photonic cross-connects).

     1. Introduction 

        When a Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) label 
        Switched Path (LSP) fails to deliver user traffic, the failure 
        cannot always be detected by the GMPLS control plane. There is 
        a need to provide a tool that enables users to detect such 
        traffic "black holes" or misrouting within a reasonable period 
        of time, and a mechanism to isolate faults [GMPLS-OAM-REQ]. 
        Similarly, the ability to trace the route of GMPLS LSPs in 
        networks where data and control planes are separated is a 
        requirement [GMPLS-OAM-REQ]. This document provides solution 
        to these requirements.  

        [RFC4379] describes procedures for LSP Ping for LSPs with 
        Packet Switch Capable (PSC) endpoints and transit switching 
        capabilities. However, the LSP Ping solution is not applicable 
        to LSPs crossing or terminating at non-PSC devices. This is 
        because the solution described in [RFC4379] requires all 
        transit and end point nodes along the LSP path to be able to 
        intercept the MPLS OAM (Operation and Maintenance) packets 
        traveling in the data plane and identify the target Forwarding 
        Equivalence Class (FEC) Stack being tested. Such operations 
        cannot be realized at nodes that are non PSC-capable.  

        Moreover, the LSP Ping mechanism described in [RFC4379] may be 
        inadequate even when the end points of the GMPLS LSP are PSC-
        capable. This is because the GMPLS LSP may appear as a single 
        hop for procedures described in [RFC4379]. In such cases, 
        mechanisms in [RFC4379] are able to detect data plane failure 
        in the GMPLS LSP but are still not able to isolate failures in 
        underlying switching layers. Similarly, in this scenario, the 
        GMPLS LSP appears as a single hop during traceroute 
        procedures. This document describes a mechanism that can be 
        used to detect and isolate data plane failures in GMPLS LSPs 
        with non-PSC transit switching capability.  

        As mentioned above, the Echo Request [RFC4379] follows the 
        same path as data packets, i.e., they are not control plane 
        messages. This is also a limitation when tracing a GMPLS LSP 
        with non-PSC transit nodes. This is because non-PSC devices 
        are incapable of intercepting the MPLS echo request packets, 
        and hence, cannot process these packets, e.g., check or update 
        TTL values needed for traceroute functionality. A consequence 
        of this is that traceroute for GMPLS LSPs has to be performed

        out-of-band in the control network, probing entities that 
        control the non-PSC devices (e.g. optical cross-connects). 
        This draft also proposes extensions to LSP traceroute 
        procedures that can be implemented in GMPLS networks with data 
        and control plane separation. 

        The proposed solutions are based on the Link Management 
        Protocol (LMP) [RFC4204] and Multiprotocol Label Switching 
        (MPLS) Operations and Management (OAM) solutions [RFC4379]. In 
        the following sections, we outline how existing LMP and MPLS 
        OAM procedures needs to be modified to provide ping and 
        tracerouting functionality in GMPLS networks. Recall the scope 
        of this draft is cases where data plane does not provide the 
        OAM functions addressed by this draft (e.g., pre-OTH  photonic 
        cross-connects). Use of OAM functionality provided by the data 
        planes is RECOMMENDED and procedures described in this draft 
        are only assumed to be applied when OAM mechanisms are not 
        supported by the data plane or are deficient.

     2. Connectivity Verification and Isolating Faults  

        LMP fault isolation mechanism [RFC4204] can be used to detect 
        and isolate failures along a GMPLS LSP. The requirement is to 
        be able to check the health of an LSP before carrying traffic 
        over it. Consequently, the ability to use LMP fault isolation 
        mechanism for this purpose largely depends on the transport 
        technology. Specifically, in technologies where a signal is 
        (constantly) carried even without data, LMP fault isolation 
        procedure can be applied as soon as LSP is setup. This draft 
        addresses technologies where this is not possible (e.g., pre-
        OTH cross-connects) by extending the use LMP "Test" message 
        for connectivity verification and fault isolation. For this 
        purpose, the draft proposes an extended LMP model as shown 
        below.

                         Figure 1 Extended LMP Model. 

        In this model, the Ingress and Egress nodes of the LSP under 
        verification may establish and maintain LMP session. The nodes 
        continue to maintain hop-by-hop LMP sessions to build traffic 
        engineering (TE) links for GMPLS signaling and routing, as 
        described in [RFC4204]. For example in Figure 1, OXC1-OXC2 
        (LMP1), OXC2-OXC3 (LMP2), and OXC3-OXC4 (LMP3) LMP sessions 
        are used to build traffic-engineering (TE) links for GMPLS 
        signaling and routing, while the LMP session between OXC1-OXC4 
        (LMP4) is used to monitor health of GMPLS LSP(s) with OXC1 and 
        OXC4 as end-points. Existing signaling mechanism (e.g., 
        LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID object for RSVP-TE signaling  
        [RFC3477], [) are used to discover remote link properties, 
        i.e., the LMP session between LSP end-point nodes is only used 
        for OAM purposes. 

        Once an LMP session between LSP end-point nodes comes up, Link 
        connectivity verification can be used to perform LSP 
        connectivity verification.  This is done by sending Test 
        messages over the GMPLS LSP and TestStatus messages back over 
        the control channel. For this purpose, LMP connectivity 
        verification procedure as described in [RFC4204] is used. It 
        is important to note LMP link verification procedure [RFC4204] 
        applies to equally to PSC and non-PSC TE links. Similarly, in 
        order to send Test messages over the GMPLS LSP, the end-point 
        of the LSP does not have to be PSC.   

     2.1. Control Channel Management 

        The control channel management for LSP ingress-node-to-egress-
        node is the same as described in [RFC4204]. To distinguish 
        between an LSP ingress-node-to-egress-node LMP session and a 
        peer node-to-peer node LMP session, or LMP-WDM session, a new 
        bit for LMP-WDM_CONFIG object [RFC4209] is defined as follows: 

         

           Class = 6, C-Type = 2, LMP-WDM_CONFIG [RFC4209]. 
         
            0                   1                   2

        | 
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
        +-+-+-+ 
          
           The Reserved field should be sent as zero and ignored on 
        receipt. W and O bits are defined in [RFC4209]. The draft 
        defined the "L" bit, where "L" stands for LMP peering for 
        "LSP". 

           L :  1 bit 

        This bit indicates that the peer node wants to establish an 
        LMP session to test LSP(s). The L bit is defined to 
        distinguish LSP-ingress-node-to-LSP-egress-node LMP sessions 
        from other types of LMP sessions as defined in [RFC4204]and 
        [RFC4209].  

        To establish an ingress-node-to-egress-node LMP session, the 
        Ingress node sets "L" bit in the LMP-WDM_CONFIG message and 
        sends it to the peering Egress node for LSP(s) under test. The 
        Egress nodes can also initiate LMP session by sending LMP-
        WDM_CONFIG message with L = 1. [RFC4209] requires a node that 
        does not support LMP-WDM_CONFIG message to MUST reply with a 
        ConfigNack message. If a node supports LMP-WDM_CONFIG message 
        but does not support L bit, it MUST reply to  the LMP-
        WDM_CONFIG message with a ConfigNack message. The rest of the 
        details for control channel management follow [RFC4204]. 

     2.2. LSP Verification Procedure 

        The link verification procedure described in [RFC4204] has 
        been adapted for LSP verification. Specifically, once a 
        control channel has been established between the ingress and 
        egress nodes of an LSP, LSP connectivity can be verified by 
        exchanging Test messages between nodes along the GMPLS LSP's 
        path. Since the LSP's health can be tested along the 
        forwarding transmit path, both endpoints nodes can 
        (independently and simultaneously) initiate the exchange of 
        Test messages in each direction to test for the health of 
        bidirectional LSPs. 


      
      
        Z. Ali, et al        Expires May 11, 2008            [Page 6] 
         
       Internet-Draft draft-ali-ccamp-gmpls-LSP-ping-traceroute-00.txt       
         

        To initiate the link verification procedure, the Ingress 
        (Egress) node MUST send a BeginVerify message over a control 
        channel with IP address of the destination (source) node of 
        the LSP.  To limit the scope of LSP Verification to a 
        particular LSP, LSP-id is used in LOCAL_LINK_ID or 
        REMOTE_LINK_ID fields of the LMP message exchanges during 
        verification. If the LINK_ID field is zero, the verification 
        can span multiple LSPs between the set of Ingress/Egress nodes 
        involved in the verification process. The rest of the details 
        for LSP verification follow the LMP link verification 
        procedure [RFC4204].  

     3. Fault Isolation  

        If LSP verification fails, the LMP fault isolation procedure 
        [RFC4204] can be applied. For this purpose, the Ingress 
        (Egress) node initiating the LSP fault localization procedure 
        starts the LSP verification procedure by setting 
        VerifyInterval to a time interval large enough to perform 
        fault isolation procedure. Actual selection of the interval is 
        a local decision, but the requirement is that LMP link 
        verification procedure should not time out before the fault is 
        localized. The node initiating the LSP fault localization 
        procedure then starts sending the Test message over the LSP 
        under test. This enables a downstream node (downstream in 
        terms Test message flow) to detect data link failure where the 
        LSP may be broken. This downstream node then sends a 
        ChannelStatus message to its upstream neighbor indicating that 
        a failure has been detected. The rest of details for the LSP 
        fault isolation procedure follows LMP fault isolation 
        procedure [RFC4204]. 

     4. Tracerouting 

        As mentioned above, one of the consequences of transparent 
        nature of optical cross-connects is that traceroute for GMPLS 
        LSPs has to be performed out-of-band in the control network, 
        probing entities that control the non-PSC devices (e.g., 
        optical cross-connects). This also requires control entities 
        to be in-sync with the forwarding states of the device. How 
        control entities achieves this goal is beyond the scope of 
        this document.  

        When the route of a GMPLS LSP is traced in the control 
        network, MPLS Echo Request packets are dispatched toward each 
        transit LSR of the LSP while including the LSP's tested FEC, 
        and setting the appropriate value of the TTL in the MPLS echo

        request. The main issue with probing GMPLS flows in the 
        control plane is that the control network topology is entirely 
        independent of the data network topology; For example, an MPLS 
        echo request probe packet may travel multiple hops in the 
        control plane to reach an LSR that is only 1 hop away in the 
        data plane. This draft proposes use of GRE encapsulation of 
        MPLS Echo request messages and a method to force Echo requests 
        to follow the data plane's topology, while flowing through the 
        control network. Other tunneling techniques, like IP-in-IP are 
        equally applicable.  

        The sender of the MPLS echo packets encapsulate the IP/UDP 
        MPLS echo request packet using GRE. The GRE packet can then be 
        routed inside the control network to the next hop transit LSR 
        in the control plane. The receiver control entity decapsulates 
        the GRE header and then processes the echo request by looking 
        up the FEC for the data LSP and sending the echo reply with 
        the appropriate downstream mappings.  

        Both Ingress and Egress LSRs can start LSP tracing operations. 
        The Ingress (Egress) LSR follows the following steps:  

       1. The Ingress (Egress) LSR finds optical nodes that are one 
          hop away in data plane. The exact details on how Ingress 
          (Egress) LSR finds optical nodes that are one hop away in 
          data plane is beyond the scope of this document but using 
          the control plane state of the LSP under trace, the ingress 
          LSP can determine the IP address of the control plane node 
          that is one hop downstream (upstream), even when RRO is not 
          used.  

       2. The Ingress LSR sends MPLS echo Request packet with TTL=1 
          and encapsulates it using GRE to the node that it finds in 
          the last steps.  
       3. When the control entities at the optical node that is 
          assumed to be  one hop away in data plane, receives the MPLS 
          echo request message from the ingress (Egress) LSR via GRE 
          tunnel, it examines the tested FEC contained in the MPLS 
          Echo request, and sends an echo reply back to the ingress 
          (Egress) LSR if it has a crossconnect for the FEC under 
          test. If the receiving control node has a crossconnect for 
          the FEC under test, the node also returns the control plane 
          address of the next hop node (obtained in fashion mentioned 
          in step 1). This will allow the ingress to tunnel to the 
          next control plane node. Details for how MPLS Echo response

          the document.  
       4. Upon receiving the Echo reply, Ingress (Egress) nodes 
          prepares a Echo Request packet with TTL = 1 and encapsulates 
          it using GRE to the node that it learned via Echo reply in 
          step 3. 
       5. The Ingress (Egress) LSR repeats the same procedure for 
          nodes that it learns from step 4 until it learns destination 
          (source) node and repeats step 4 for destination (source) 
          node.  
        
     5. Security Considerations 

        Security considerations and requirements form [RFC4204] and 
        [RFC4379] apply equally to this document. Furthermore, there 
        are some additional security considerations that may be 
        induced by extended LMP model proposed by this draft. These 
        security considerations will be added in a later version of 
        the draft.
