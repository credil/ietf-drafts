      <t>The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group has standardized
      metrics for measuring end-to-end performance between two points. This
      memo defines two new categories of metrics that extend the coverage to
      multiple measurement points. It defines spatial metrics for measuring
      the performance of segments of a source to destination path, and metrics
      for measuring the performance between a source and many destinations in
      multiparty communications (e.g., a multicast tree).</t>

        </list></t>

      <t>This memo defines two new categories of metrics that extend the
      coverage to multiple measurement points. It first defines spatial
      metrics for measuring the performance of segments of a source to
      destination path: <list style="symbols">
          <t>A 'vector', called Type-P-Spatial-One-way-Delay-Vector, will be
          introduced to divide an end-to-end Type-P-One-way-Delay <xref
          target="RFC2679"></xref> into a spatial sequence of one-way delay
          metrics.</t>

          <t>A 'vector', called Type-P-Spatial-One-way-Packet-Loss-Vector,
          will be introduced to divide an end-to-end
          Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss <xref target="RFC2680"></xref> in a
          spatial sequence of packet loss metrics.</t>

          <t>Using the Type-P-Spatial-One-way-Delay-Vector metric, a 'vector',
          called Type-P-Spatial-One-way-ipdv-Vector, will be introduced to
          divide an end-to-end Type-P-One-way-ipdv in a spatial sequence of
          ipdv metrics.</t>

          <t>Using the Type-P-Spatial-One-way-Delay-Vector metric, a 'sample',
          called Type-P-Segment-One-way-Delay-Stream, will be introduced to
          collect one-way delay metrics over time between two points of
          interest of the path;</t>

          <t>Using the Type-P-Spatial-Packet-Loss-Vector metric, a 'sample',
          called Type-P-Segment-Packet-Loss-Stream, will be introduced to
          collect packet loss metrics over time between two points of interest
          of the path;</t>

          <t>Using the Type-P-Spatial-One-way-Delay-Vector metric, a 'sample',
          called Type-P-Segment-ipdv-prev-Stream, will be introduced to
          compute ipdv metrics over time between two points of interest of the
          path using the previous packet selection function;</t>

          <t>Using the Type-P-Spatial-One-way-Delay-Vector metric, a 'sample',
          called Type-P-Segment-ipdv-min-Stream, will be introduced to compute
          ipdv metrics over time between two points of interest of the path
          using the shortest delay selection function;</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Note that all these metrics are based on observations of packets
      dedicated to testing, a process which is called Active measurement.
      Purely passive spatial measurement (for example, a spatial metric based
      on the observation of user traffic) is beyond the scope of this document
      and the current IPPM charter.</t>

      <t>Next, this memo defines one-to-group metrics. <list style="symbols">
          <t>Using one test packet sent from one sender to a group of
          receivers, a metric called Type-P-one-to-group-One-way-Delay-Vector
          will be introduced to collect the set of Type-P-one-way-delay <xref
          target="RFC2679"></xref> singletons between this sender and the
          group of receivers.</t>

          <t>Using one test packet sent from one sender to a group of
          receivers, a metric called
          Type-P-one-to-group-One-way-Packet-Loss-Vector, will be introduced
          to collect the set of Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss <xref
          target="RFC2680"></xref> singletons between this sender and the
          group of receivers</t>

          <t>Using one test packet sent from one sender to a group of
          receivers, a metric called Type-P-one-to-group-One-way-ipdv-Vector,
          will be introduced to collect the set of Type-P-One-way-ipdv
          singletons between this sender and the group of receivers</t>

          <t>A discussion section presents the set of statistics that may be
          computed using these metrics to present the network performance in
          the view of a group of users. The statistics may be the basis for
          requirements (e.g. fairness) on multiparty communications. .</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Metric Reporting is defined in the "Manageability Considerations"
      section.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <section title="Path Digest Hosts">
        <t>The list of the hosts on a path from the source to the
        destination.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Multiparty metric">
        <t>A metric is said to be multiparty if the topology involves more
        than one measurement collection point. All multiparty metrics define a
        set of hosts called "points of interest", where one host is the source
        and other hosts are the measurement collection points. For example, if
        the set of points of interest is &lt; ha, hb, hc, ..., hn &gt;, where
        ha is the source and &lt; hb, hc, ..., hn &gt; are the destinations,
        then measurements may be conducted between &lt; ha, hb&gt;, &lt; ha,
        hc&gt;, ..., &lt;ha, hn &gt;.</t>

        <t>For the purposes of this memo (reflecting the scope of a single
        source), the only multiparty metrics are one-to-group metrics.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Spatial metric">
        <t>A metric is said to be spatial if one of the hosts (measurement
        collection points) involved is neither the source nor a destination of
        the measured packet.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="One-to-group metric">
        <t>A metric is said to be one-to-group if the measured packet is sent
        by one source and (potentially) received by several destinations.
        Thus, the topology of the communication group can be viewed as a
        centre-distributed or server-client topology with the source as the
        centre/server in the topology.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Points of interest">
        <t>Points of interest are the hosts* (as per RFC2330 definition, that
        includes routing nodes) that are measurement collection points, a
        sub-set of the set of hosts involved in the delivery of the packets
        (in addition to the source itself). Note that the points of interest
        are a possibly arbitrary sub-set of all the hosts involved in the
        path.</t>

        <t>Points of interest of one-to-group metrics are the intended
        destination hosts for packets from the source (in addition to the
        source itself).</t>

      <section title="Reference point">
        <t>A reference point is defined as the server where the statistical
        calculations will be carried out. A centre/server in the multimetrics
        measurement that is controlled by a network operator is a good example
        of a reference point, where measurement data can be collected for
        further processing. However, the actual measurements have to be
        carried out at all points of interest.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Vector ">
        <t>A Vector is a set of singletons, which are a set of results of the
        observation of the behaviour of the same packet at different places of
        a network at different times. For instance, if one-way delay
        singletons observed at N receivers for Packet P sent by the source Src
        are dT1, dT2,&hellip;, dTN, it can be say that a vector V with N
        elements can be organized as {dT1, dT2,&hellip;, dTN}. The elements in
        one vector are singletons distinct with each other in terms of both
        measurement point and sending time. Given the vector V as an example,
        the element dT1 is distinct from all others as the singleton at
        receiver 1 in response to a packet sent from the source at time T1.
        The complete Vector gives information over the dimension of space.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Matrix">
        <t>Several vectors form a Matrix, which contains results observed in a
        sampling interval at different places in a network at different times.
        For instance, given One-way delay vectors V1={dT11, dT12,..., dT1N},
        V2={dT21, dT22,&hellip;, dT2N},&hellip;, Vm={dTm1, dTm2,&hellip;,
        dTmN} for Packet P1, P2,&hellip;,Pm, we can have a One-way delay
        Matrix {V1, V2,&hellip;,Vm}. Additional to the information given by a
        Vector, a Matrix is more powerful to present network performance in
        both space and time dimensions. It normally corresponds to a sample in
        simple point-to-point measurement.</t>

        following <xref target="Figmatrix"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="Motivations">
      <t>All IPPM metrics are defined for end-to-end (source to destination)
      measurement of point-to-point paths. It is a logical extension to define
      metrics for multiparty measurements such as one to one trajectory
      metrics and one to multipoint metrics.</t>

      <section title="Motivations for spatial metrics">
        <t>Decomposition of instantaneous end-to-end measures is needed: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Decomposing the performance of interdomain path is desirable to
            quantify the per-AS contribution to the performance. It is
            valuable to define standard spatial metrics before pursuing
            inter-domain path performance specifications.</t>

            <t>Traffic engineering and troubleshooting applications benefit
            from spatial views of one-way delay and ipdv consumption, and
            identification of the location of the lost of packets.</t>

            <t>Monitoring the performance of a multicast tree composed of MPLS
            point-to-multipoint and inter-domain communication require spatial
            decomposition of the one-way delay, ipdv, and packet loss.</t>

            <t>Composition of metrics <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-ippm-spatial-composition"></xref> is needed to
            help measurement systems reach large scale coverage. Spatial
            measures typically give the individual performance of an intra
            domain segment and provide an elementary piece of information
            needed to estimate interdomain performance based on composition of
            metrics.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Motivations for One-to-group metrics">
        <t>While the node-to-node based spatial measures can provide very
        useful data in the view of each connection, we also need measures to
        present the performance of a multiparty communication topology. A
        simple one-way metric cannot completely describe the multiparty
        situation. New one-to-group metrics assess performance of all the
        paths for further statistical analysis. The new metrics proposed in
        this stage are named one-to-group performance metrics, and they are
        based on the unicast metrics defined in IPPM WG. One-to-group metrics
        are one-way metrics from one source to a group of destinations. The
        metrics are helpful for judging the network performance of multiparty
        communications and can also be used to describe the variation of
        performance delivered to a group of destination hosts and their
        users.</t>

        <t>One-to-group performance metrics are needed for several
        reasons:</t>

          </list>To understand the packet transfer performance between one
        source and any one receiver in the multiparty communication group, we
        need to collect instantaneous end-to-end metrics, or singletons. It
        will give a very detailed insight into each branch of the multicast
        tree in terms of end-to-end absolute performance. This detail can
        provide clear and helpful information for engineers to identify the
        sub-path with problems in a complex multiparty routing tree.</t>

        <t>The one-to-group metrics described in this memo introduce the
        multiparty topology to the IPPM working group; the goal is to measure
        the performance delivered to a group of users who are receiving
        packets from the same source. The concept extends the "path" in the
        one-way measurement to "path tree" to cover both one-to-one and
        one-to-many communications. If applied to one-to-one communications,
        the one-to-group metrics provide exactly the same results as the
        corresponding one-to-one metrics.</t>

      <section title="Discussion on Group-to-one and Group-to-group metrics">
        <t>We note that points of interest can also be selected to define
        measurements on group-to-one and group-to-group topologies. These
        topologies are currently beyond the scope of this memo, because they
        would involve multiple packets launched from different sources.
        However, we can give some clues here on these two cases.</t>

        <t>The measurements for group-to-one topology can be easily derived
        from the one-to-group measurement. The measurement point is the
        reference point that is acting as a receiver while all of
        clients/receivers defined for one-to-group measurement act as sources
        in this case.</t>

        <t>For the group-to-group connection topology, it is difficult to
        define the reference point and therefore it is difficult to define the
        measurement points. However, we can always avoid this confusion by
        treating the connections as one-to-group or group-to-one in our
        measurements without consideration on how the real communication will
        be carried out. For example, if one group of hosts &lt; ha, hb, hc,
        ..., hn &gt; are acting as sources to send data to another group of
        hosts &lt; Ha, Hb, Hc, ..., Hm &gt;, we can always decompose them into
        n one-to-group communications as &lt; ha, Ha, Hb, Hc, ..., Hm &gt;,
        &lt; hb, Ha, Hb, Hc, ..., Hm &gt;, &lt;hc, Ha, Hb, Hc, ..., Hm &gt;,
        ..., &lt; hn, Ha, Hb, Hc, ..., Hm &gt;.</t>

        involved in the measure. Spatial One-way ipdv measurement SHOULD be
        respectful of methodology, clock, uncertainties and reporting aspects
        given in this section.</t>

        <t>Generally, for a given Type-P of length L, in a given Hi, the

            style="symbols">
            <t>At each Hi, points of interest prepare to capture the packet

            <t>Each Hi computes the one-way-delay from Src to Hi: dTi = Ti -

            <t>The reference point gathers the result of each Hi and order

        <section title="Loss threshold ">
          <t>Loss threshold is the centrality of any methodology because it
          determines the presence the packet in the measurement process of the
          point of interest and consequently determines any ground truth
          metric result. It determines the presence of an effective delay, and
          bias the measure of ipdv, of packet loss and of the statistics.</t>

          <t>This is consistent for end-to-end but impacts spatial measure:
          depending on the consistency of the loss threshold among the points
          of interest, a packet may be considered loss a one host but present
          in another one, or may be observed by the last host (last hop) of
          the path but considered lost by Dst. The analysis of such results is
          not deterministic: Has the path change? Does the packet arrive at
          destination or was it lost during the last mile? The same applies,
          of course, for one-way-delay measures: a delay measured may be
          infinite at one host but a real value in another one, or may be
          measured as a real value by the last host of the path but observed
          as infinite by Dst. The loss threshold should be set up with the
          same value in each host of the path and in the destination. The loss
          threshold must be systematically reported to permit careful
          introspection and to avoid the introduction of any contradiction in
          the statistic computation process.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Host Path Digest ">
          <t>The methodology given above relies on the order of the points of
          interest over the path to <xref target="RFC2679"></xref> one's.</t>

          <t>A test packets may cross several times the same host resulting in
          the repetition of one or several hosts in the Path Digest.</t>

          <t>As an example. This occurs typically during rerouting phases
          which introduce temporary micro loops. During such an event the host
          path digest for a packet crossing Ha and Hb may include the pattern
          &lt;Hb, Ha, Hb, Ha, Hb&gt; meaning that Ha ended the computation of
          the new path before Hb and that the initial path wath from Ha to Hb
          and that the new path is from Hb to Ha.</t>

          <t>Consequently, duplication of hosts in the Path Digest of a
          vectors MUST be identified before statistics computation to avoid
          corrupted results' production.</t>

      <t>The defined one-to-group metrics above can all be directly achieved
      from the relevant unicast one-way metrics. They collect all unicast
      measurement results of one-way metrics together in one profile and sort
      them by receivers and packets in a receiving group. They provide
      sufficient information regarding the network performance in terms of
      each receiver and guide engineers to identify potential problem happened
      on each branch of a multicast routing tree. However, these metrics
      cannot be directly used to conveniently present the performance in terms
      of a group and neither to identify the relative performance
      situation.</t>

      <t>From the performance point of view, the multiparty communication
      services not only require the absolute performance support but also the
      relative performance. The relative performance means the difference
      between absolute performance of all users. Directly using the one-way
      metrics cannot present the relative performance situation. However, if
      we use the variations of all users one-way parameters, we can have new
      metrics to measure the difference of the absolute performance and hence
      provide the threshold value of relative performance that a multiparty
      service might demand. A very good example of the high relative
      performance requirement is the online gaming. A very light difference in
      delay might result in failure in the game. We have to use multicast
      specific statistic metrics to define exactly how small the relative
      delay the online gaming requires. There are many other services, e.g.
      online biding, online stock market, etc., that require multicast metrics
      in order to evaluate the network against their requirements. Therefore,
      we can see the importance of new, multicast specific, statistic metrics
      to feed this need.</t>

      <t>We might also use some one-to-group statistic conceptions to present
      and report the group performance and relative performance to save the
      report transmission bandwidth. Statistics have been defined for One- way
      metrics in corresponding RFCs. They provide the foundation of definition
      for performance statistics. For instance, there are definitions for
      minimum and maximum One-way delay in [RFC2679]. However, there is a
      dramatic difference between the statistics for one-to-one communications
      and for one-to-many communications. The former one only has statistics
      over the time dimension while the later one can have statistics over
      both time and space dimensions. This space dimension is introduced by
      the Matrix concept as illustrated in <xref
      target="FigMatrixConcept"></xref>. For a Matrix M each row is a set of
      One-way singletons spreading over the time dimension and each column is
      another set of One-way singletons spreading over the space
      dimension.</t>

      <t>In Matrix M, each element is a one-way delay singleton. Each column
      is a delay vector contains the One-way delays of the same packet
      observed at M points of interest. It implies the geographical factor of
      the performance within a group. Each row is a set of One-way delays
      observed during a sampling interval at one of the points of interest. It
      presents the delay performance at a receiver over the time
      dimension.</t>

      <t>Therefore, one can either calculate statistics by rows over the space
      dimension or by columns over the time dimension. It's up to the
      operators or service provides which dimension they are interested in.
      For example, a TV broadcast service provider might want to know the
      statistical performance of each user in a long term run to make sure
      their services are acceptable and stable. While for an online gaming
      service provider, he might be more interested to know if all users are
      served fairly by calculating the statistics over the space dimension.
      This memo does not intend to recommend which of the statistics are
      better than the other.</t>

      <t>To save the report transmission bandwidth, each point of interest can
      send statistics in a pre-defined time interval to the reference point
      rather than sending every one-way singleton it observed. As long as an
      appropriate time interval is decided, appropriate statistics can
      represent the performance in a certain accurate scale. How to decide the
      time interval and how to bootstrap all points of interest and the
      reference point depend on applications. For instance, applications with
      lower transmission rate can have the time interval longer and ones with
      higher transmission rate can have the time interval shorter. However,
      this is out of the scope of this memo.</t>

      <t>Moreover, after knowing the statistics over the time dimension, one
      might want to know how this statistics distributed over the space
      dimension. For instance, a TV broadcast service provider had the
      performance Matrix M and calculated the One-way delay mean over the time
      dimension to obtain a delay Vector as {V1,V2,..., VN}. He then
      calculated the mean of all the elements in the Vector to see what level
      of delay he has served to all N users. This new delay mean gives
      information on how good the service has been delivered to a group of
      users during a sampling interval in terms of delay. It needs twice
      calculation to have this statistic over both time and space dimensions.
      We name this kind of statistics 2-level statistics to distinct with
      those 1-level statistics calculated over either space or time dimension.
      It can be easily prove that no matter over which dimension a 2-level
      statistic is calculated first, the results are the same. I.e. one can
      calculate the 2-level delay mean using the Matrix M by having the
      1-level delay mean over the time dimension first and then calculate the
      mean of the obtained vector to find out the 2-level delay mean. Or, he
      can do the 1-level statistic calculation over the space dimension first
      and then have the 2-level delay mean. Both two results will be exactly
      the same. Therefore, when define a 2-level statistic, there is no need
      to specify in which procedure the calculation should follow.</t>

      <t>Comment: The above statement depends on whether the order of
      operations has any affect on the outcome.</t>

      <t>Many statistics can be defined for the proposed one-to-group metrics
      over either the space dimension or the time dimension or both. This memo
      treats the case where a stream of packets from the Source results in a
      sample at each of the Receivers in the Group, and these samples are each
      summarized with the usual statistics employed in one-to-one
      communication. New statistic definitions are presented, which summarize
      the one-to-one statistics over all the Receivers in the Group.</t>

      <section title="Discussion on the Impact of packet loss on statistics">
        <t>The packet loss does have effects on one-way metrics and their
        statistics. For example, the lost packet can result an infinite
        one-way delay. It is easy to handle the problem by simply ignoring the
        infinite value in the metrics and in the calculation of the
        corresponding statistics. However, the packet loss has so strong
        impact on the statistics calculation for the one-to-group metrics that
        it can not be solved by the same method used for one-way metrics. This
        is due to the complex of building a Matrix, which is needed for
        calculation of the statistics proposed in this memo.</t>

        <t>The situation is that measurement results obtained by different end
        users might have different packet loss pattern. For example, for
        User1, packet A was observed lost. And for User2, packet A was
        successfully received but packet B was lost. If the method to overcome
        the packet loss for one-way metrics is applied, the two singleton sets
        reported by User1 and User2 will be different in terms of the
        transmitted packets. Moreover, if User1 and User2 have different
        number of lost packets, the size of the results will be different.
        Therefore, for the centralized calculation, the reference point will
        not be able to use these two results to build up the group Matrix and
        can not calculate the statistics. In an extreme situation, no single
        packet arrives all users in the measurement and the Matrix will be
        empty. One of the possible solutions is to replace the
        infinite/undefined delay value by the average of the two adjacent
        values. For example, if the result reported by user1 is { R1dT1 R1dT2
        R1dT3 &hellip; R1dTK-1 UNDEF R1dTK+1&hellip; R1DM } where
        &ldquo;UNDEF&rdquo; is an undefined value, the reference point can
        replace it by R1dTK = {(R1dTK-1)+( R1dTK+1)}/2. Therefore, this result
        can be used to build up the group Matrix with an estimated value
        R1dTK. There are other possible solutions such as using the overall
        mean of the whole result to replace the infinite/undefined value, and
        so on. It is out of the scope of this memo.</t>

        <t>For the distributed calculation, the reported statistics might have
        different &ldquo;weight&rdquo; to present the group performance, which
        is especially true for delay and ipdv relevant metrics. For example,
        User1 calculates the Type-P-Finite-One-way-Delay-Mean R1DM as shown in
        Figure. 8 without any packet loss and User2 calculates the R2DM with
        N-2 packet loss. The R1DM and R2DM should not be treated with equal
        weight because R2DM was calculated only based on 2 delay values in the
        whole sample interval. One possible solution is to use a weight factor
        to mark every statistic value sent by users and use this factor for
        further statistic calculation.</t>

    <section title="Measurement Methods: Scalability and Reporting">
      <t>Virtually all the guidance on measurement processes supplied by the
      earlier IPPM RFCs (such as <xref target="RFC2679"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC2680"></xref>) for one-to-one scenarios is applicable here in
      the spatial and multiparty measurement scenario. The main difference is
      that the spatial and multiparty configurations require multiple
      measurement points where a stream of singletons will be collected. The
      amount of information requiring storage grows with both the number of
      metrics and the number of measurement points, so the scale of the
      measurement architecture multiplies the number of singleton results that
      must be collected and processed.</t>

      <t>It is possible that the architecture for results collection involves
      a single aggregation point with connectivity to all the measurement
      points. In this case, the number of measurement points determines both
      storage capacity and packet transfer capacity of the host acting as the
      aggregation point. However, both the storage and transfer capacity can
      be reduced if the measurement points are capable of computing the
      summary statistics that describe each measurement interval. This is
      consistent with many operational monitoring architectures today, where
      even the individual singletons may not be stored at each measurement
      point.</t>

      <t>In recognition of the likely need to minimize form of the results for
      storage and communication, the Group metrics above have been constructed
      to allow some computations on a per-Receiver basis. This means that each
      Receiver's statistics would normally have an equal weight with all other
      Receivers in the Group (regardless of the number of packets
      received).</t>

      <t></t>

      <section title="Computation methods">
        <t></t>

        <t>The scalability issue can be raised when there are thousands of
        points of interest in a group who are trying to send back the
        measurement results to the reference point for further processing and
        analysis. The points of interest can send either the whole measured
        sample or only the calculated statistics. The former one is a
        centralized statistic calculation method and the latter one is a
        distributed statistic calculation method. The sample should include
        all metrics parameters, the values and the corresponding sequence
        numbers. The transmission of the whole sample can cost much more
        bandwidth than the transmission of the statistics that should include
        all statistic parameters specified by policies and the additional
        information about the whole sample, such as the size of the sample,
        the group address, the address of the point of interest, the ID of the
        sample session, and so on. Apparently, the centralized calculation
        method can require much more bandwidth than the distributed
        calculation method when the sample size is big. This is especially
        true when the measurement has huge number of the points of interest.
        It can lead to a scalability issue at the reference point by over load
        the network resources. The distributed calculation method can save
        much more bandwidth and release the pressure of the scalability issue
        at the reference point side. However, it can result in the lack of
        information because not all measured singletons are obtained for
        building up the group matrix. The performance over time can be hidden
        from the analysis. For example, the loss pattern can be missed by
        simply accepting the loss ratio as well as the delay pattern. This
        tradeoff between the bandwidth consuming and the information acquiring
        has to be taken into account when design the measurement campaign to
        optimize the measurement results delivery. The possible solution could
        be to transit the statistic parameters to the reference point first to
        obtain the general information of the group performance. If the detail
        results are required, the reference point should send the requests to
        the points of interest, which could be particular ones or the whole
        group. This procedure can happen in the off peak time and can be well
        scheduled to avoid delivery of too many points of interest at the same
        time. Compression techniques can also be used to minimize the
        bandwidth required by the transmission. This could be a measurement
        protocol to report the measurement results. It is out of the scope of
        this memo.</t>

      <section title="Measurement">
        <t>To prevent any bias in the result, the configuration of a

        critical.</t>

        <t>In both cases the volume of data to report is proportional to the
        number of probes. But there is a major difference between these 2
        methods: <list>
            <t>method2: In space and time aggregation mode the volume of data
            to collect is proportional to the number of test packets received;
            Each received packet RiSi triggers out a block of data that must
            be reported to a common place for computing the stat over
            space;</t>

            <t>method1: In time and space aggregation mode the volume of data
            to collect is proportional to the period of aggregation, so it
            does not depend on the number of packet received;</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Method 2 property has severe drawbacks in terms of security and
        dimensioning: <list>
            <t>The increasing of the rate of the test packets may result in a
            sort of DoS toward the computation points;</t>

            <t>The dimensioning of a measurement system is quite impossible to

        control of various collecting aspects such as bandwidth and
        computation and storage capacities. So this draft defines metrics
        based on method 1.</t>

        <t>Note: In some specific cases one may need sample of singletons over
        space. To address this need it is suggested firstly to limit the
        number of test and the number of test packets per seconds. Then
        reducing the size of the sample over time to one packet give sample of
        singleton over space..</t>

    <section title="Manageability Considerations">
      <t>Usually IPPM WG documents defines each metric reporting within its
      definition. This document defines the reporting of all the metrics
      introduced in a single section to provide consistent information while
      avoiding repetitions. The aim is to contribute to the work of the WG on
      the reporting and to satisfy IESG recommendation of gathering
      manageability considerations in a dedicated section.</t>

      <t>Data models of spatial and one-to-group metrics are similar excepted
      that points of interests of spatial vectors must be ordered.</t>

      <t>The complexity of the reporting relies on the number of points of
      interests.</t>

      <section title="Reporting spatial metric">
        <t>The reporting of spatial metrics shares a lot of aspects with
        RFC2679-80. New ones are common to all the definitions and are mostly
        related to the reporting of the path and of methodology parameters
        that may bias raw results analysis. This section presents these
        specific parameters and then lists exhaustively the parameters that
        shall be reported.</t>

        <section title="Path">
          <t>End-to-end metrics can't determine the path of the measure
          despite IPPM RFCs recommend it to be reported (Section 3.8.4 of
          [RFC2679]). Spatial metrics vectors provide this path. The report of
          a spatial vector must include the points of interests involved: the
          sub set of the hosts of the path participating to the instantaneous
          measure.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Host order">
          <t>A spatial vector must order the points of interest according to
          their order in the path. It is highly suggested to use the TTL in
          IPv4, the Hop Limit in IPv6 or the corresponding information in
          MPLS.</t>

          <t>The report of a spatial vector must include the ordered list of
          the hosts involved in the instantaneous measure.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Timestamping bias">
          <t>The location of the point of interest inside a node influences
          the timestamping skew and accuracy. As an example, consider that
          some internal machinery delays the timestamping up to 3 milliseconds
          then the minimal uncertainty reported be 3 ms if the internal delay
          is unknown at the time of the timestamping.</t>

          <t>The report of a spatial vector must include the uncertainty of
          the timestamping compared to wire time.</t>

        <section title="Reporting spatial One-way Delay">
          <t>The reporting includes information to report for one-way-delay as

      <section title="Reporting One-to-group metric">
        <t>All reporting rules described in RFC2679-80 apply to the
        corresponding One-to-group metrics RFC2679-80. In addition, several
        new parameters are needed to report which are common to all the
        metrics and are presented here.</t>

        <section title="Path">
          <t>As suggested by the RFC2679-80, the path traversed by the packet
          SHOULD be reported, if possible. For One-to-group metrics, there is
          a path tree SHOULD be reported rather than A path. This is even more
          impractical. If, by anyway, partial information is available to
          report, it might not be as valuable as it is in the one-to-one case
          because the incomplete path might be difficult to identify its
          position in the path tree. For example, how many points of interest
          are reached by the packet traveled through this incomplete path?
          However, the multicast path tree is normally more stable than
          unicast, which is dependant on multicast routing protocols. For
          example, the PIM-SM protocol [RFC4601] initializes the multicast
          route before any data packets are sent to the receivers.</t>

        reference point network interfaces and the reference point computation
        capacities.</t>

        <t>The configuration of a measure must take in consideration that
        implicitly more packets will to be routed than send and selects a test
        packets rate accordingly. Collecting statistics from a huge number of
        probes may overload any combination of the network where the

        <t>one-to-group metrics measurement should consider using source
