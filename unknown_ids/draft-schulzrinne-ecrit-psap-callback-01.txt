Abstract

   After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated
   by the emergency caller or normally by the call-taker) it is possible
   that the call-taker feels the need for further communication or for a
   clarification.  For example, the call may have been dropped by
   accident without the call-taker having sufficient information about
   the current situation of a wounded person.  A call-taker may trigger
   a callback towards the emergency caller using the contact information
   provided with the initial emergency call.  This callback could, under
   certain circumstances, then be treated like any other call and as a
   consequence, it may get blocked by authorization policies or may get
   forwarded to an answering machine.

   The IETF emergency services architecture addresses callbacks in a
   limited fashion and thereby covers a couple of scenarios.  This
   document discusses some shortcomings and raises the question whether
   additional solution techniques are needed.

1.  Introduction

   Summoning police, the fire department or an ambulance in emergencies
   is one of the fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone.
   As telephone functionality moves from circuit-switched telephony to
   Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that this core
   functionality will continue to work at least as well as it has for
   the legacy technology.  New devices and services are being made
   available that could be used to make a request for help, which are
   not traditional telephones, and users are increasingly expecting them
   to be used to place emergency calls.

   Regulatory requirements demand that the emergency call itself
   provides enough information to allow the call-taker to initiate a
   call back to the emergency caller in case the call dropped or to
   interact with the emergency caller in case of further questions.
   Such a call, referred as PSAP callback subsequently in this document,
   may, however, be blocked or forwarded to an answering machine as SIP
   entities (SIP proxies as well as the SIP UA itself) cannot associate
   the potential importantance of the call based on the SIP signaling.

      Note that the authors are, however, not aware of regulatory
      requirements for providing preferential treatment of callbacks
      initiated by the call-taker at the PSAP towards the emergency
      caller.

   Section 10 of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework] discusses the identifiers
   required for callbacks, namely AOR URI and a globally routable URI in
   a Contact: header.  Section 13 of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework] provides
   the following guidance regarding callback handling:

      A UA may be able to determine a PSAP call back by examining the
      domain of incoming calls after placing an emergency call and
      comparing that to the domain of the answering PSAP from the
      emergency call.  Any call from the same domain and directed to the
      supplied Contact header or AoR after an emergency call should be
      accepted as a call-back from the PSAP if it occurs within a
      reasonable time after an emergency call was placed.

   This approach mimics a stateful packet filtering firewall and is
   indeed helpful in a number of cases.  Below, we discuss a few cases
   where this approach fails.

1.1.  Multi-Stage Resolution

   Consider the following emergency call routing scenario shown in
   Figure 1 where routing towards the PSAP occurs in several stages.  An
   emergency call uses a SIP UA that does not run LoST on the end point.

   Hence, the call is marked with the 'urn:service:sos' Service URN
   [RFC5031].  The user's VoIP provider receives the emergency call and
   determines where to route it.  Local configuration or a LoST lookup
   might, in our example, reveal that emergency calls are routed via a
   dedicated provider FooBar and targeted to a specific entity, referred
   as esrp1@foobar.com.  FooBar does not handle emergency calls itself
   but performs another resolution step to let calls enter the emergency
   services network and in this case another resolution step takes place
   and esrp-a@esinet.org is determined as the recipient, pointing to an
   edge device at the IP-based emergency services network.  Inside the
   emergency services there might be more sophisticated routing taking
   place somewhat depending on the existing structure of the emergency
   services infrastructure.

1.2.  Call Forwarding

   Imagine the following case where an emergency call enters an
   emergency network (state.org) via an ERSP but then gets forwarded to
   a different emergency services network (in our example to police-
   town.org, fire-town.org or medic-town.org).  The same considerations
   apply when the the police, fire and ambulance networks are part of
   the state.org sub-domains (e.g., police.state.org).

1.3.  PSTN Interworking

   In case an emergency call enters the PSTN, as shown in Figure 3,
   there is no guarantee that the callback some time later does leave
   the same PSTN/VoIP gateway or that the same end point identifier is
   used in the forward as well as in the backward direction making it
   difficult to reliably detect PSAP callbacks.

      marking to bypass blacklists, ignore call forwarding procedures
      and similar features to interact with users and to raise their
      attention.  For example, using PSAP callback marking devices would
      be able to recognize these types of incoming messages leading to
      the device overriding user interface configurations, such as
      vibrate-only mode.  As such, the requirement is to ensure that the
      mechanisms described in this document can not be used for
      malicious purposes, including SPIT.

   Fallback to Normal Call

      When the newly defined extension is not recognized by
      intermediaries or other entities then it MUST NOT lead to a
      failure of the call handling procedure but rather a fall-back to a
      call that did not have any marking provided.

   In addition to the high-level requirements there are a few design
   choices.

   What is the granularity of the decision making?

      There are a few choices that impact the solution mechanism quite
      considerably:

      *  Verify that the caller is a PSAP

      *  Verify that the call is in response to a previous emergency
         call.

      *  Verify that the call is related to an emergency, but not
         necessarily an earlier emergency call.  This might include
         public notification (authority-to-citizen).

   Who calls back?

      The relationship between the person who previously received the
      emergency call and the person who triggers the callback allows a
      couple of choices:

      *  The callback has to be made using the same User Agent.

      *  The callback has to made by the same user but potentially with
         a different UA.

      *  A different user from a different UA can make the callback.

4.  Solution Approaches

   This version of the document does not yet contain a fully specified
   solution description.  Instead, it tries to explore the different
   alternatives.

   An example solution can be found in an earlier version of
   [I-D.patel-ecrit-sos-parameter].  The "sos" URI parameter is appended
   to the URI in the Contact header field of the INVITE request for PSAP
   call-back establishment.  Although this approach can distinguish the
   PSAP call-back from other sessions, such a solution is prone to
   security vulnerabilities since the insertion of the URI parameter
   cannot verify the request was generated from a PSAP rather than a
   malicious entity.

   The usage of the In-Reply-To header field can provide the capability
   to relate the PSAP call-back to a previously made emergency call.
   The UA of the emergency caller, as well as enities within the service
   provider's network can therefore infer that the request is a PSAP
   callback, providing they maintained information pertaining to the
   emergency call.  This solution also relies on the PSAP call-back
   routing over the same entities that the emergency call was routed
   over if such a solution is used to provide preferential treatment of
   callbacks.  A solution based on the inclusion of the In-Reply-To
   header would be useful in the case the network or the UA is required
   to disable services or features which may prevent the callback from
   reaching the UA from which the emergency call was placed.
   Furthermore, it may facilitate success of the callback by removing,
   for example, incoming call barring restrictions that may have been
   enforced for the emergency caller's service.

   To fulfill the requirements of verifying the caller is a PSAP,
   mechanisms such as those described in RFC 4474 [RFC4474] or in RFC
   3325 [RFC3325] are recommended to be used.  Such an approach would
   mitigate security vulnerabilities, but does not explicitly mark the
   request generated from the PSAP as a request for callback.
   Additional information, such a PSAP whitelist, would have to be
   known.  This is, however, only likely to work in a smaller scale
   rather than world wide.

   The use of the Calling Party's Category URI parameter in the
   P-Asserted-Identity [RFC3325], as described in
   [I-D.patel-dispatch-cpc-oli-parameter], is one method of a network
   asserted identifier, describing the nature of the calling party and
   in this case, the PSAP.  This approach only works when the entity
   that inserts the CPC parameter is trusted by those who verify it.
   This relies on a circle of trust similar to the a white list.
   Additionally, it has to be mentioned that unlike [I-D.ietf-sip-saml]

   applying SIP Identity over the parameter does not ensure that the
   authentication service indeed asserts the validity of the parameter.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document provides discussions problems of PSAP callbacks and
   lists requirements, some of which illustrate security challenges.
   The current version does not yet provide a specific solution but
   rather starts with overall architectural observations.

   An important aspect from a security point of view is the relationship
   between the emergency services network and the VSP (assuming that the
   emergency call travels via the VSP and not directly between the SIP
   UA and the PSAP).  If there is a strong trust relationship between
   the PSAP operator and the VSP (for example based on a peering
   relationship) without any intermediate VoIP providers then the
   identification of a PSAP call back is less problematic than in the
   case where the two entities have not entered in some form of
   relationship that would allow the VSP to verify whether the marked
   callback message indeed came from a legitimate source.
