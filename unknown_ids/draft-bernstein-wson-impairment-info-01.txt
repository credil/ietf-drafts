Internet-Draft      Optical Impairment Info Model         February 2009 
    

1. Introduction 

   Impairments in optical networks can be accounted for in a number of 
   ways as discussed in reference [Imp-Frame]. This document provides an 
   information model for path validation in optical networks utilizing 
   approximate computations. The definitions, characteristics and usage 
   of the optical parameters that form this model are based on ITU-T 
   recommendation G.680 [G.680]. This impairment related model is 
   intentionally compatible with the impairment free model of reference 
   [RWA-Info]. Although this document focuses on the optical impairment 
   parameters from a control plane point of view, Appendix B provides a 
   list of optical parameter definitions from ITU-T G.680 and related 
   documents. 

2. Optical Impairment Information Model 

   The definitions of optical impairment parameters of network elements 
   and examples of their use can be found in [G.680] and related 
   documents (also see Appendix B). From an information modeling and 
   control plane perspective, one basic aspect of a given parameter is 
   the scope of its applicability within a network element. In 
   particular we need to know which parameters will (a) apply to the 
   network element as a whole, (b) can vary on a per port basis for a 
   network element, and (c) can vary based on ingress to egress port 
   pairs. A second orthogonal aspect of impairment parameters is whether 
   a parameter exhibits a strong frequency variation over the optical 
   frequencies supported by the subnetwork. 

2.1. Network Element Wide Parameters 

   Based on the definitions in [G.680] and related documents the 
   following parameters apply to the network element as a whole. At most 
   one of these parameters is required per network element. 

   1. Channel frequency range (GHz, Max, Min) 

   2. Channel insertion loss deviation (dB, Max) 

   3. Ripple (dB, Max) 

   4. Channel chromatic dispersion (ps/nm, Max, Min) 

   5. Differential group delay (ps, Max) 

   6. Polarization dependent loss (dB, Max) 

   7. Reflectance (passive component) (dB, Max)

   8. Reconfigure time/Switching time (ms, Max, Min) 

   9. Channel uniformity (dB, Max) 

   10.Channel addition/removal (steady-state) gain response (dB, Max, 
      Min) 

   11.Transient duration (ms, Max) 

   12.Transient gain increase (dB, Max) 

   13.Transient gain reduction (dB, Max) 

   14.Multichannel gain-change difference (inter-channel gain-change 
      difference) (dB, Max) 

   15.Multichannel gain tilt (inter-channel gain-change ratio)(dB, Max) 

2.2. Per Port Parameters 

   The following optical parameters may exhibit per port dependence, 
   hence may be specified at most once for each port of the network 
   element. 

   1. Total input power range (dBm, Max, Min) 

   2. Channel input power range (dBm, Max, Min) 

   3. Channel output power range (dBm, Max, Min) 

   4. Input reflectance (dB, Max) (with amplifiers) 

   5. Output reflectance (dB, Max) (with amplifiers) 

   6. Maximum reflectance tolerable at input (dB, Min) 

   7. Maximum reflectance tolerable at output (dB, Min) 

   8. Maximum total output power (dBm, Max) 

2.3. Port to Port Parameters 

   The following optical parameters may exhibit a port-to-port 
   dependence and hence may be specified at most once for each 
   ingress/egress port pair of the network element. 

   1. Insertion loss (dB, Max, Min)

Internet-Draft      Optical Impairment Info Model         February 2009 
    

   2. Isolation, adjacent channel (dB, Min) 

   3. Isolation, non-adjacent channel (dB, Min) 

   4. Channel extinction (dB, Min) 

   5. Channel signal-spontaneous noise figure (dB, Max) 

   6. Channel gain (dB, Max, Min) 

2.4. Frequency Dependent Parameters 

   Many of the previously mentioned parameters can exhibit a significant 
   frequency dependence over the range of wavelength supported by a 
   subnetwork. In reference [G.680] parameters denoted as related to 
   "channel" could exhibit significant frequency variation that would 
   need to be encoded efficiently. These parameters may include: 

   1. Channel insertion loss deviation (dB, Max) 

   2. Channel chromatic dispersion (ps/nm, Max, Min) 

   3. Channel uniformity (dB, Max) 

   4. Insertion loss (dB, Max, Min) 

   5. Channel extinction (dB, Min) 

   6. Channel signal-spontaneous noise figure (dB, Max) 

   7. Channel gain (dB, Max, Min) 

   Finalization of this list is TBD and will need liaison with ITU-T. 

    

3. Encoding Considerations 

   The units for the various parameters include GHz, dB, dBm, ms, ps, 
   and ps/nm. These are typically expressed as floating point numbers. 
   Due to the measurement limitations inherent in these parameters 
   single precision floating point, e.g., 32 bit IEEE floating point, 
   numbers should be sufficient. 

   For realistic optical network elements per port and port-to-port 
   parameters typically only assume a few values. For example, the 
   channel gain of a ROADM is usually specified in terms of input to

   drop, add to output, and input to output. This implies that many port 
   and port-to-port parameters could be efficiently specified, stored 
   and transported by making use of the Link Set Sub-TLV and 
   Connectivity Matrix Sub-TLV of reference [Encode]. 

   For parameters that vary with frequency we have the following 
   options: 

   1. Explicit parameter list with associated frequencies: Here we would 
      give the parameter and frequencies it applies to.  We would need 
      as many of these parameter/frequency pairs as necessary to cover 
      all the frequencies and parameters. This could get large for a 
      high channel count system with strong frequency dependencies in 
      some parameters. 

   2. Provide "standardized" general interpolation formulas and 
      parameters for use over an entire frequency range or sub-range.  

   3. Use parameter specific interpolation formulas based on ITU-T and 
      other standards. For example in reference [G.650.1]Annex A 
      equations and fitting coefficients are given for chromatic 
      dispersion interpolation. Such formulas may be valid over an 
      entire frequency range or a sub-range. 

4. Usage of Parameters in Optical Path Validation 

   Given an optical path and the optical characteristics of each network 
   element along the path we can then use these characteristics to 
   validate the path. We envision that these parameters will be made 
   available via some mechanism to the entity which validates optical 
   paths. Refer to [Imp-Frame] for architectural options in which 
   impairment validation for an optical path is defined.  

   Sections 9 and 10 of G.680 give techniques and formulas for use in 
   calculating the impact of a cascade of network elements such as 
   occurs along an optical signal path. These range from relatively 
   simple bounds on the sum of uncompensated chromatic dispersion 
   (residual dispersion) to more elaborate formulas for overall optical 
   signal to noise ration (OSNR) computations based on multiple 
   parameters including noise factor. 

   To further aid understanding and use of these optical parameters 
   Appendix I of [G.680] provides example parameter values for different 
   network element types and appendix II provides examples of 
   computations involving the cascades of network elements along a path.

5. Security Considerations 

   This document defines an information model for impairments in optical 
   networks. If such a model is put into use within a network it will by 
   its nature contain details of the physical characteristics of an 
   optical network. Such information would need to be protected from 
   intentional or unintentional disclosure. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This draft does not currently require any consideration from IANA.  

7. Conclusions 

   The state of standardization of optical device characteristics has 
   matured from when initial IETF work concerning optical impairments 
   was investigated in [RFC4054]. Relatively recent ITU-T 
   recommendations provide a standardized based of optical 
   characteristic definitions and parameters that control plane 
   technologies such as GMPLS and PCE can make use of in performing 
   optical path validation. The enclosed information model shows how 
   readily such ITU-T optical work can be utilized within the control 
   plane.

Internet-Draft      Optical Impairment Info Model         February 2009 
    

APPENDIX A: Distributed Impairment Accumulation Model 

   In reference [Imp-Frame] an alternative impairment aware RWA control 
   plane based on distributed impairment validation was discussed. In 
   such a scheme the preceding impairment information model would not be 
   distributed via a link state IGP, instead a set of impairment 
   parameters would be computed along the proposed path and a final 
   decision on whether the path is viable would be made based on these 
   accumulated impairment parameters. It should be noted that these 
   accumulated impairment parameters are estimated at each node along 
   the path and not measured. 

   When signaling a path we think of the "nodes" as being the switching 
   nodes along the path. In the case of optical impairments the 
   properties of the links (WDM line systems) are just as important as 
   the properties of the nodes. In the following we will assume that the 
   switching nodes (GMPLS nodes) will act on behalf of all the line 
   systems corresponding to their egress ports. In particular this 
   implies that some how these nodes will obtain the line system 
   impairment information.

   In Figure 1 we show an example system from appendix II of [G.680]. 
   This diagram shows the DWDM line systems including amplifiers, BA = 
   booster amplifier, LA = line amplifier. For distributed impairment 
   validation we would group the line systems with their preceding nodes 
   as shown for computational purposes. 

    
   Section 9 of ITU-T G.680 [G.680] shows how various impairment 
   parameters accumulate and this suggests that the following parameters 
   or subset thereof could be used in distributed impairment estimation: 

   o  Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR) 

   o  Residual Dispersion (chromatic) 
 
 
Bernstein              Expires August 24, 2009                 [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft      Optical Impairment Info Model         February 2009 
    

   o  Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD) 

   o  Polarization Dependent Loss (PDL) 

   o  Ripple 

   o  Channel Uniformity 

   For each of the above the units and accumulation procedure needs to 
   be defined. In the following we suggest units and procedures for the 
   above for which computation of cascaded elements are suitably defined 
   in [G.680]. Note: ONE = Optical Network Element. 

A.1. Distributed Computation of OSNR 

   Section 9.1 of ITU-T G.680 gives several equivalent formulas for the 
   estimation of OSNR. For distributed impairment validation the 
   following formula from [G.680] is convenient: 

   OSNR_out = -10*log(Term1 + Term2) 

   Where 

   Term1 = 10^-(ONSR_in/10), and  

   Term2 = 10^-((P_in-NF-10*log(h*v*vr))/10) 

   and we have the following additional definitions: 

   OSNR_out is the output optical signal to noise ratio in dB of the ONE 

   OSNR_in is the input optical signal to noise ratio in dB of the ONE 

   P_in is the channel power (dBm) at the input port of the ONE 

   NF is the noise figure (dB) of the relevant path through the ONE 

   h is Planck's constant (in mJ*s to be consistent with P_in in dBm) 

   v is the optical frequency in Hz 

   vr is the reference bandwidth in Hz (usually the frequency equivalent 
   of 0.1nm) 

   From the previous formula, a distributed computation of OSNR requires 
   knowing the OSNR_in and the P_in based on computations from the 
   previous node along the path. The noise figure, F, is something that 
 
 
Bernstein              Expires August 24, 2009                 [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft      Optical Impairment Info Model         February 2009 
    

   the current node performing the computation would know along with the 
   frequency, v, and the reference bandwidth vr (TBD: confirm with ITU-
   T).  

   The control plane will need to distribute the following information 
   from node to node along the path:  

   o  OSNR_in (this is the accumulated OSNR along the path)(dB) 

   o  P_in (this is the estimated power into the next node)(dBm) 

   The input power would be calculated by the previous node by taking 
   into account gain and attenuation on the link between the nodes. 

A.2. Distributed Computation of Residual Dispersion 

   The residual dispersion for a path is required to be bounded, in 
   particular from [G.680] equation 9-4: 

   Min RD < Residual Dispersion < Max RD 

   Where Min RD and Max RD are the minimum and maximum tolerable 
   residual dispersion for a particular transmitter/receiver 
   combination. 

   The residual dispersion for a cascade of network elements can be 
   computed by [G.680] equation 9-5: 

   Residual dispersion = sum(fiber dispersion) + sum(DCM dispersion) 
                         + sum(ONE dispersion) 
    

   Where DCM dispersion is from Dispersion Compensation Modules (DCM), 
   and ONE dispersion is due to optical network elements. 

   Although the residual dispersion formula is a relatively simple 
   linear formula [G.680] indicates two possible methods for its 
   evaluation (a) Worst-case upper and lower bounds, or (b)Statistical 
   approach. In case (a) two parameters would need to be accumulated 
   along the path a worst case upper and lower bound. In case (b) some 
   type of statistical information would be needed in [G.680] mean and 
   standard deviation are used under a Gaussian assumption. 

A.3. Distributed Computation of PMD 

   The accumulated impact of line system and ONE polarization mode 
   dispersion can be estimated via the formula [G.680] equation (9-6):

Internet-Draft      Optical Impairment Info Model         February 2009 
    

   DGDmax_link = {DGDmaxf^2 + S^2*sum_i(PMDc_i^2)}^(1/2) 

   where  

      DGDmax_link is the max link DGD (ps) 

      DGDmxf      is the max concatenated optical fiber cable DGD (ps) 

      S           is the Maxwell adjustment factor(Table 9-2 of [G.680]) 

      PMDc_i      is the PMD value for the ith component (ps) 

   Under a distributed computation approach the above could be computed 
   by keeping track of DGDmaxf and the running sum of PMDc_i^2. The 
   Maxwell adjustment factor and final square root can be applied at the 
   final node in the path. [Question for Q6: does DGDMaxf^2 need to be 
   accumulated over the different link segments?]

APPENDIX B: Optical Parameters 

   The following provides an annotated list of optical characteristics 
   from ITU-T recommendation G.680 [G.680] for use in optical path 
   impairment computations. For each parameter we specify the units to 
   be used, whether minimum or maximum values are used, and whether the 
   parameters applies to the optical network element as a whole, on a 
   per port basis or on a port-to-port pair basis.  

   Not all these parameters will apply to all devices. The main 
   differentiation in G.680 comes from those network elements that 
   include or do not include optical amplifiers. 

B.1. Parameters for NEs without optical amplifiers 

   Channel frequency range (GHz, Max, Min): [G.671] The frequency range 
   within which a DWDM device is required to operate with a specified 
   performance. For a particular nominal channel central frequency, 
   fnomi, this frequency range is from fimin = (fnomi - dfmax) to fimax 
   = (fnomi + dfmax), where dfmax is the maximum channel central 
   frequency deviation. Nominal channel central frequency and maximum 
   channel central frequency deviation are defined in ITU-T Rec. G.692. 

   Insertion loss (dB, Port-Port, Max, Min):[G.671] It is the reduction 
   in optical power between an input and output port of a WDM device in 
   decibels (dB). 

   Channel insertion loss deviation (dB, Max):[G.671] This is the 
   maximum variation of insertion loss at any frequency within the 
   channel frequency range (DWDM devices) or channel wavelength range 
   (CWDM and WWDM devices). 

   Ripple (dB, Max): [G.671] For WDM devices and tuneable filters, the

   parameters of the device (e.g., isolation and channel extinction)are 
   within the allowed limits.
