Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                      May 2009


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of the
   Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) [I-D:ietf-manet-nhdp] process
   on a router.  The NHDP MIB also reports state information,
   performance information and notifications.  This additional state and
   performance information is useful to management stations
   troubleshooting neighbor discovery problems.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The NHDP protocol allows routers in a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET)
   setting to discover and track one-hop and two-hop neighbor sets.
   This information is useful for routers running various routing and
   multicast flooding protocols developed within the IETF MANET Working
   Group.

4.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB.

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                      May 2009


   o  Tunable Configuration Objects - objects whose values affect timing
      or attempt bounds on the NHDP protocol.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the NHDP protocol process in the
      router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      NHDP protocol process on the router and the overall discovery
      performance within the NHDP domain.

4.2.  Organization

   This document is organized as ...

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the NHDP MIB module.  The MIB
   is arranged into the following structure:

   o  nhdpNotifications - objects defining NHDP MIB notifications.

   o  nhdpObjects - defining objects within this MIB.  The objects are
      arranged into the following groups:

   o

      *  General Information Group - defining objects of a general
         nature, e.g., version numbers.

      *  Configuration Group - defining objects related to the
         configuration of the NHDP instance on the device.

      *  State Group - defining objects which reflect the current state
         of the NHDP running on the device.

      *  Performance Group - defining objects which are useful to a
         management station when characterizing the performance of the
         NHDP on the device and in the MANET.

   o  nhdpConformance - defining the minimal and maximal conformance
      requirements for implementations of this MIB.

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                      May 2009


5.1.  Textual Conventions

   This section is TBD.

5.2.  The General Information Group

   This section provides general information about the capabilities of
   the device running the NHDP.  This group is currently empty and will
   be removed in future drafts if no objects are identified.

5.3.  The Configuration Group

   The device is configured with a set of controls.  These will serve as
   the object descriptions once they are discussed and refined.  The
   list of configuration controls for the NHDP-MIB (found in [ietf-
   manet-nhdp]), are discussed in the following subsections.

5.3.1.  Interface Parameters

   The Interface Parameters include:

5.3.1.1.  Message Intervals

   o  HELLO_INTERVAL - is the maximum time between the transmission of
      two successive HELLO messages on this MANET interface.  If using
      periodic transmission of HELLO messages, these SHOULD be at a
      separation of HELLO_INTERVAL, possibly modified by jitter as
      specified in [XXX].

   o  HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL - is the minimum interval between transmission
      of two successive HELLO messages, on this MANET interface.  (This
      minimum interval MAY be modified by jitter, as defined in [XXX].)

   o  REFRESH_INTERVAL - is the maximum interval between advertisements
      in a HELLO message of each 1-hop neighbor address and its status.
      In all intervals of length REFRESH_INTERVAL, a node MUST include
      all 1-hop neighbor information which it is specified as sending in
      at least one HELLO message on this MANET interface.

   The following constraints apply to these interface parameters:

   o  HELLO_INTERVAL > 0

   o  HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL >= 0

   o  HELLO_INTERVAL >= HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                      May 2009


   o  REFRESH_INTERVAL >= HELLO_INTERVAL

   o  If INTERVAL_TIME message TLVs as defined in [XXX] are included in
      HELLO messages, then HELLO_INTERVAL MUST be representable as
      described in [XXX].

   o  If REFRESH_INTERVAL > HELLO_INTERVAL, then a node may distribute
      its neighbor advertisements between HELLO messages in any manner,
      subject to the constraints above.

   o  For a node to employ this protocol in a purely responsive manner
      on a MANET interface, REFRESH_INTERVAL and HELLO_INTERVAL SHOULD
      both be set to a value such that a responsive HELLO message is
      always expected in a shorter period than this.

   The following default values are recommended:

   o  HELLO_INTERVAL = 2 seconds

   o  HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL = HELLO_INTERVAL/4

   o  REFRESH_INTERVAL = HELLO_INTERVAL

5.3.1.2.  Information Validity Times

   Parameters related to the Information Validity Times include:

   o  L_HOLD_TIME - is the period of advertisement, on this MANET
      interface, of former 1-hop neighbor addresses as lost in HELLO
      messages, allowing recipients of these HELLO messages to
      accelerate removal of information from their Link Sets.
      L_HOLD_TIME can be set to zero if accelerated information removal
      is not required.

   o  H_HOLD_TIME - is used as the value in the VALIDITY_TIME message
      TLV included in all HELLO messages on this MANET interface.

   The following constraints apply to these interface parameters:

   o  L_HOLD_TIME >= 0

   o  H_HOLD_TIME >= REFRESH_INTERVAL

   o  If HELLO messages can be lost then both SHOULD be significantly
      greater than REFRESH_INTERVAL.

   o  H_HOLD_TIME MUST be representable as described in [XXX].

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                      May 2009


   o  H_HOLD_TIME = 3 x REFRESH_INTERVAL

   o  L_HOLD_TIME = H_HOLD_TIME

   o  N_HOLD_TIME = L_HOLD_TIME

   o  I_HOLD_TIME = N_HOLD_TIME

5.3.1.3.  Link Quality

   Parameters related to the Link Quality include:

   o  HYST_ACCEPT - is the link quality threshold at or above which a
      link becomes usable, if it was not already so.

   o  HYST_REJECT - is the link quality threshold below which a link
      becomes unusable, if it was not already so.

   o  INITIAL_QUALITY - is the initial quality of a newly identified
      link.

   o  INITIAL_PENDING - if true, then a newly identified link is
      considered pending, and is not usable until the link quality has
      reached or exceeded the HYST_ACCEPT threshold.

   The following constraints apply to these interface parameters:

   o  0 < = HYST_REJECT < = HYST_ACCEPT < = 1

   o  0 < = INITIAL_QUALITY < = 1.

   o  If link quality is not updated, then INITIAL_QUALITY >=
      HYST_ACCEPT.

   o  If INITIAL_QUALITY => HYST_ACCEPT, then INITIAL_PENDING == false.

   o  If INITIAL_QUALITY < HYST_REJECT, then INITIAL_PENDING == true.

   Link quality is a mechanism whereby a node MAY take considerations
   other than message exchange into account for determining when a link
   is and is not a candidate for being considered as HEARD or SYMMETRIC.
   Link quality is used only locally by a node, and nodes may fully
   inter-operate whether they are using the same, different or no link
   quality methods.

   NHDP can be operated when the local node does not implement Link
   Quality.  In order for a node to not employ link quality, the node
   MUST define:

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                      May 2009


   o  INITIAL_PENDING = false

   o  INITIAL_QUALITY >= HYST_REJECT (there is no reason not to define
      INITIAL_QUALITY = 1).

   If link quality is changed, then parameter values will depend on the
   link quality process.  If link quality is not changed, then:

   o  HYST_ACCEPT = 1

   o  HYST_REJECT = 0

   o  INITIAL_QUALITY = 1

   o  INITIAL_PENDING = false

5.3.1.4.  Jitter

   If jitter, as defined in [XXX], is used then these parameters are as
   follows:

   o  HP_MAXJITTER - represents the value of MAXJITTER used in [XXX] for
      periodically generated HELLO messages on this MANET interface.

   o  HT_MAXJITTER - represents the value of MAXJITTER used in [XXX] for
      externally triggered HELLO messages on this MANET interface.

   For constraints on these interface parameters see [XXX].

   The following default values are recommended:

   o  HP_MAXJITTER = HELLO_INTERVAL/4

   o  HT_MAXJITTER = HP_MAXJITTER

   o  C = 1/1024 second

5.3.2.  Node Parameters

   The following Node Parameters apply:

5.3.2.1.  Information Validity Time

   o  N_HOLD_TIME - is used as the period during which former 1-hop
      neighbor addresses are advertised as lost in HELLO messages,
      allowing recipients of these HELLO messages to accelerate removal
      of information from their 2-Hop Sets.  N_HOLD_TIME can be set to
      zero if accelerated information removal is not required.

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                      May 2009


   o  I_HOLD_TIME - is the period for which a recently used local
      interface address is recorded.

   The following constraints applies to these node parameters:

   o  N_HOLD_TIME >= 0

   o  I_HOLD_TIME >= 0

5.3.3.  Parameter Change Constraints

   These parameters may be made dynamic:

   o  HELLO_INTERVAL

   o  REFRESH_INTERVAL

   o  HYST_ACCEPT and HYST_REJECT

   o  L_HOLD_TIME

   o  N_HOLD_TIME

   o  HP_MAXJITTER

   o  HT_MAXJITTER

5.4.  The State Group

   The State Subtree reports current state information, including
   neighbor tables.  These are separately discussed below.

   (Note: these will serve as the object descriptions once they are
   discussed and refined.)

   The Local Information Base (LIB), contains the addresses of the
   interfaces (MANET and non-MANET) of this node.  The contents of this
   Information Base are not changed by signaling.  The LIB contains two
   tables:

   o  The "Local Interface Set", which consists of Local Interface
      Tuples, each of which records the addresses of an interface (MANET
      or non- MANET) of the node.

   o  The "Removed Interface Address Set", which consists of Removed
      Interface Address Tuples, each of which records a recently used
      address of an interface (MANET or non-MANET) of the node.  A
      node's Removed Interface Address Set records addresses which were

      recently local interface addresses.  If a node's interface
      addresses are immutable then this set is always empty and MAY be
      omitted.

   The Interface Information Based (IIB), recording information
   regarding links to this MANET interface and symmetric 2-hop neighbors
   which can be reached through such links.  The IIB contains two
   tables:

   o  A "Link Set", which records information about current and recently
      lost links between this interface and MANET interfaces of 1-hop
      neighbors.  The Link Set consists of Link Tuples, each of which
      contains information about a single link.  Recently lost links are
      recorded so that they can be advertised in HELLO messages,
      accelerating their removal from relevant 1-hop neighbors' Link
      Sets.  Link quality information, if used and available, is
      recorded in Link Tuples and may indicate that links are treated as
      lost.

   o  A "Two-Hop Set", which records the existence of bidirectional
      links between symmetric 1-hop neighbors of this MANET interface
      and other nodes (symmetric 2-hop neighbors).  The 2-Hop Set
      consists of 2-Hop Tuples, each of which records an interface
      address of a symmetric 2-hop neighbor, and all interface addresses
      of the corresponding symmetric 1-hop neighbor.  The 2-Hop Set is
      updated by the signaling of this protocol, but is not itself
      reported in that signaling.

   The Node Information Base (NIB), records information regarding
   current and recently lost 1-hop neighbors of this node.  The NIB
   contains two tables:

   o  The "Neighbor Set", and

   o  The "Lost Neighbor Set".

5.5.  The Performance Group

   Reports values relevant to system performance.  These will serve as
   the object descriptions once they are discussed and refined.

5.6.  The Notifications

   The Notifications Subtree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the NHDP MIB and their intended purpose or utility.
   This group is currently empty, pending further discussion.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   [TODO]: The text of this section specifies the relationship of the
   MIB modules contained in this document to other standards,
   particularly to standards containing other MIB modules.  Definitions
   imported from other MIB modules and other MIB modules that SHOULD be
   implemented in conjunction with the MIB module contained within this
   document are identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The NHDP-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   [TODO] This section is included as an example; If the MIB module is
   not an adjunct of the Interface MIB, then this section should be
   removed.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   [TODO]: Citations are not permitted within a MIB module, but any
   module mentioned in an IMPORTS clause or document mentioned in a
   REFERENCE clause is a Normative reference, and must be cited
   someplace within the narrative sections.  If there are imported items
   in the MIB module, such as Textual Conventions, that are not already
   cited, they can be cited in text here.  Since relationships to other
   MIB modules should be described in the narrative text, this section
   is typically used to cite modules from which Textual Conventions are
   imported.

   The following NHDP MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB
   [RFC2863]

     DESCRIPTION
         "A locally arbitrary unique identifier associated with an
         NHDP neighbor interface.

         All objects of type NeighborIfIndex are assigned by the agent
         out of a common number space. In other words, NeighborIfIndex
         values assigned to entries in one table must not overlap with
         NeighborIfIndex values assigned to entries in another
         table.

         The NeighborIfIndex defines a discovered interface of a 1-hop
         or 2-hop neighbor of the local node.  The agent identifies a
         unique neighbor interface through the reciept of an address
         list advertised through an NHDP HELLO message.

         The value for each discovered neighbor interface must remain
         constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's
         network management system to the next re-initialization, except
         that if an application is deleted and re-created.

         The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP
         entity. An NeighborIfIndex value must not be re-used until the
         next agent restart."

   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] writable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive if
      abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
      security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
      example.

   o  [TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
   use the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   [TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
   following boilerplate paragraph.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
      are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
      be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer

      information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
      European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)

   o  [TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
   information should have.  The following three boilerplate paragraphs
   should not be changed without very good reason.  Changes will almost
   certainly require justification during IESG review.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
   http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
   submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
   Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
   depending what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section
   3.5 for more information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module
   document.

   [TODO] select an option and provide the necessary details.

   Option #1:

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                      May 2009


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
   MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in a draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

10.  Contributors

   This MIB document uses the template authored by D. Harrington which
   is based on contributions from the MIB Doctors, especially Juergen
   Schoenwaelder, Dave Perkins, C.M.Heard and Randy Presuhn.

   [TODO]This acknowledgement can be removed from your MIB module
   document.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   Here we list the changes made to the various drafts of this MIB.

   We list here the changes made on the draft-cole-manet-nhdp-mib-00
   draft to generate the draft-cole-manet-nhdp-mib-01 draft.

   1.  Defined the NeighborIfIndex and the NeighborNodeId textual
       conventions.  These identify a remote neighbor IfIndex and a
       remote neighbor node and are used as indexes into NHDP state
       tables.  These constructs were necessary in order to associate
       address lists with specific remote interfaces as required by the
       NHDP protocol specification.

   2.  Developed the nhdpInterfaceTable as part of the configuration
       group.

   3.  Developed the nhdpDiscIfSetTable as a means to associate address
       lists with remotely discovered neighbor interfaces.

   4.  Added tables defining the node's NHDP Local Information Base
       (LIB) as specified in the NHPD protocol specification.

   5.  Added tables defining the node's NHDP Interface information Base
       (IIB) as specified in the NHPD protocol specification.

Internet-Draft                The NHDP MIB                      May 2009


   6.  Added tables defining the node's NHDP Node Information Base (NIB)
       as specified in the NHPD protocol specification.

   7.  Aligned the NHDP-MIB and the OLSRv2-MIB configuration tables and
       indexing.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the NHDP-MIB.  This section will not be
   present in the final version of the MIB and will be removed once all
   the open issues have been resolved.

   1.   How to handle dynamic parameters within NHDP?  Should we expose
        setting, min and max values?

   2.   Need to address how to handle Link Quality settings and
        parameters for a) optional operation and b) changing nature of
        link quality.

   3.   What performance objects are of interest and utility?

   4.   What notifications are of interest and utility?

   5.   Identify all objects requiring non-volatile storage in their
        DESCRIPTION clauses.

   6.   Incorporate parameter relationship conditions into their
        DESCRIPTION clauses.

   7.   Also, specify specific SNMP response to the snmp set request,
        i.e., 'generic error', 'bad value', etc.

   8.   Fill in all of the DEFVAL within the configuration group
        objects.

   9.   Run through the MIB checker.

   10.  Clean up all of the 'Note:' statements within the body of the
        MIB.

   11.  Work on the Security Section.  This MIB does have settable
        objects, but not sensitive objects (true?).

   12.  Work on the relationship to other MIBs, IF-MIB, NHDP-MIB.

   13.  Cleanup all the [TODOs] from the MIB template.
