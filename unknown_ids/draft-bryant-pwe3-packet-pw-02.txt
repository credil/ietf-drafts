Abstract

   This document describes a pseudowire that is used to transport a
   packet service over an MPLS PSN is the case where the client LSR and
   the server PE are co-resident in the same equipment.  For correct
   operation these clients require a multi-protocol interface with fate
   sharing between the client protocol suite.  The packet pseudowire may
   be used to carry all of the required layer 2 and layer 3 protocols
   between the pair of client LSRs.

Internet-Draft                  Packet PW                   October 2009


1.  Introduction

   There is a need to provide a method of carrying a packet service over
   an MPLS PSN in a way that provides isolation between the two
   networks.  The server MPLS network may be an MPLS network or a
   network conforming to the MPLS-TP [RFC5317].  The client may also be
   either a MPLS network of a network conforming to the MPLS-TP.
   Considerations regarding the use of an MPLS network as a server for
   an MPLS-TP network are outside the scope of this document.

   Where the client equipment is connected to the server equipment via
   physical interface, the same data-link type MUST be used to attach
   the clients to the Provider Edge equipments (PE)s, and a pseudowire
   (PW) of the same type as the data-link MUST be used [RFC3985].  The
   reason that inter-working between different physical and data-link
   attachment types is specifically disallowed in the pseudowire
   architecture is because this is a complex task and not a simple bit-
   mapping exercise.  The inter-working is not limited to the physical
   and data-link interfaces and the state-machines.  It also requires a
   compatible approach to the formation of the adjacencies between
   attached client network equipment.  As an example the reader should
   consider the differences between router adjacency formation on a
   point to point link compared to a multi-point to multi-point
   interface (e.g.  Ethernet).

   A further consideration is that two adjacent MPLS LSRs do not simply
   exchange MPLS packets.  They exchange IP packets for adjacency
   formation, control, routing, label exchange, management and
   monitoring purposes.  In addition they may exchange data-link packets
   as part of routing (e.g.  IS-IS hellos and IS-IS LSPs) and for OAM
   purposes such as Link Layer Discovery protocol [IEEE standard
   802.1AB-2009].  Thus the two clients require an attachment mechanism
   that can be used to multiplex a number of protocols.  In addition it
   is essential to the correct operation of the network layer that all
   of these protocols fate share.

   Where the client LSR and server PE is co-located in the same
   equipment, the data-link layer can be simplified to a simple protocol
   identifier (PID) that is used to multiplex the various data-link
   types onto a pseudowire.  This is the method that described in this
   document.


2.  Network Reference Model

   The network reference model for the packet pseudowire operating in an
   MPLS network is shown in Figure 1.  This is an extension of Figure 3

   MPLS Pseudowire Network Reference Model

                                 Figure 1

   In this model LSRs, LSR1 and LSR2, are part of the client MPLS packet
   switched network (PSN).  The PEs, PE1 and PE2 are part of the server
   PSN, that is to be used to provide connectivity between the client
   LSRs.  The attachment circuit that is used to connect the MPLS LSRs
   to the PEs is a virtual interface within the equipment.  A packet
   pseudowire is used to provide connectivity between these virtual
   interfaces.  This packet pseudowire is used to transport all of the
   required layer 2 and layer 3 between protocols between LSR1 and LSR2.


3.  Forwarding Model

   The packet PW forwarding model is illustrated in Figure 2.  The
   forwarding operation can be likened to a virtual private network
   (VPN), in which a forwarding decision is first taken at the client
   layer, an encapsulation is applied and then a second forwarding
   decision is taken at the server layer.

   Packet PW Forwarding Model

                                 Figure 2

   A packet PW PE comprises three components, the client LSR, PW
   processor and a server LSR.  Note that [RFC3985] does not formally
   indicate the presence of the server LSR because it does not concern
   itself with the server layer.  However it is useful in this document
   to recognise that the server LSR exists.

   It may be useful to first recall the operation of a layer two PW such
   as an Ethernet PW [RFC4448] within this model.  The client LSR is not
   present and packets arrive directly on the attachment circuit (AC)
   which is part of the client network.  The PW undertakes any header
   processing, if configured to do so, it then pushes the PW control
   word (CW), and finally pushes the PW label.  The PW function then
   passes the packet to the LSR function which pushes the label needed
   to reach the egress PE and forwards the packet to the next hop in the
   server network.  At the egress PE, the packet typically arrives with
   the PW label at top of stack, the packet is thus directed to the
   correct PW instance.  The PW instance performs any required
   reconstruction using, if necessary, the CW and the packet is sent
   directly to the attachment circuit.

   Now let us consider the case client layer MPLS traffic being carried
   over a packet PW.  An LSR belonging to the client layer is embedded
   within the PE equipment.  This is a type of native service processing
   element [RFC3985].  This LSR determines the next hop in the client
   layer, and pushes the label needed by the next hop in the client
   layer.  It then passes the packet to the correct PW instance
   indicating the packet protocol type.  If the PW is configured to
   require a CW this is pushed.  The PW instance then examines the
   protocol type and pushes a label that identifies the protocol type to



Bryant, et al.           Expires April 24, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  Packet PW                   October 2009


   the egress PE.  The PW instance then proceeds as it would for a layer
   two PW, by pushing the PW label and then handing the packet to the
   server layer LSR for delivery.  At egress, the packet again arrives
   with the PW label at the top of stack which causes the packet to be
   passed to the correct PW instance.  This PW instance knows that the
   PW type is a packet PW, and hence that it needs to interpret the next
   label as a protocol type identifier.  If necessary the CW is then
   popped and processed.  The packet is then passed to the egress client
   LSR together with information that identifies the packet protocol
   type.  The egress client LSR then forwards the packet in the normal
   manner for a protocol of that type.

   Note that although the description above is written in terms of the
   behaviour of an MPLS LSR, the processing model would be similar for
   an IP packet, or indeed any other protocol type.

   Note that the semantics of the PW between the client LSRs is a point
   to point link.


4.  The Protocol Identifier Label

   Protocol identifier labels (PIDLs) are allocated by the egress PE.
   One PIDL is required for each unique protocol type that the egress PE
   must forward to its client LSRs.  PIDLs MUST be allocated from the
   per-platform label space.  PIDLs MUST NOT be reserved labels.  The
   mapping between protocol type and PIDL is either signaled to the
   ingress PE using the procedure described in Section 7, or is
   configured at the ingress PE.


5.  Encapsulation

   The Protocol Stack Reference Model for a packet PW is shown in
   Figure 3 below

   Where the CW is not used another method is needed to multiplex PW OAM
   into the PW.  This can be accomplished using one of the methods
   described in [RFC5085], or by using an ACH indicated using a generic
   alert label [RFC5586].

   The setting the TTL of an MPLS label is a matter of local policy on a
   PE.  However when sending the PID label the TTL SHOULD be set to 1 to
   avoid forwarding a mis-routed packet beyond the first PE receiving

   The packet pseudowire control word (CW) is optional.

   Where the CW is used, it conforms to the preferred pseudowire MPLS
   control word defined by Figure 2 of [RFC4385].  For reference the
   packet pseudowire control word is shown in Figure 5.  The definitions
   of the fragmentation (FRG), length and sequence number fields are to

                   [RFC1661].

7.2.  Procedures to distribute the PID FEC.

   The LDP procedures defined in [RFC5036] are used to distribute the
   PID label binding to the protocol ID type.  The LDP liberal label
   retention independent mode is used to distribute the PID label
   bindings, however the LDP Label request procedures MUST also be
   supported for the PID label FEC as required by [RFC5036].  Once a
   Protocol FEC label mapping is advertised by a PE, it will be used for
   all packet PWs that require that protocol.  A PE MUST mark a local
   virtual interface as faulted if the PE has not received a remote
   label binding for a protocol that is configured on the interface.
   Similarly, if a label withdraw is received for a particular protocol,
   all virtual interfaces using packet PWs that have that specific
   protocol configured MUST receive the appropriate fault condition.
   This FEC MUST only be used in conjunction with the packet PW, and
   MPLS packets containing only the advertised MPLS label MUST NOT be
   sent to the PE that advertised this FEC.  The use of this FEC element
   without the packet PW label is undefined.


8.  Status Indication

   A pseudowire status indicating a fault can be considered equivalent
   to interface down and SHOULD be passed across the virtual interface
   to the local LSR.  This improves scaling in PE with large numbers of
   co-resident LSRs and with LSRs that have large numbers of interfaces
   mapped to pseudowires.

   The mechanism described for the mapping of pseudowire status to the
   virtual interface state that are described in [RFC4447] and in
   section 10 of [I-D.ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw] apply to the packet

   pseudowire.  Pseudowire status messages indicating pseudowire or
   remote virtual interface faults MUST be mapped to a fault indication
   on the local virtual interface.


9.  Setting the load balance label

   The client service may wish the packet PW to take advantage of any
   Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) support in the server layer.  In this
   case a load balance label as described in [I-D.ietf-pwe3-fat-pw] may
   be included in the MPLS label stack.  Indeed without this feature
   there will be significant polarization of the traffic in the network,
   since most of the client traffic will be either MPLS or IP and
   therefore most of the traffic between a pair of PEs will be carried
   with the same pair of bottom of stack labels.  The FAT label must be
   inserted at the bottom of stack, i.e. below the PIDL as shown in
   Figure 7.

   |            Client             |
   |          Network Layer        |
   |            packet             |  n octets
   |                               |
   +-------------------------------+
   |    Optional Control Word      |  4 octets
   +-------------------------------+
   |        FAT Label (S=1)        |  4 octets
   +-------------------------------+
   |        PID Label (S=0)        |  4 Octets
   +-------------------------------+
   |          PW label             |  4 octets
   +-------------------------------+
   |   Server MPLS Tunnel Label(s) |  n*4 octets (four octets per label)
   +-------------------------------+

                              balancing label

   Where the client service is MPLS it would be appropriate to copy the
   client layer, bottom of stack MPLS label into the FAT label.  Where
   the client layer is IP the FAT label would typically be calculated by
   hashing on the source and destination addresses, the protocol ID and
   higher-layer flow-dependent fields such as TCP/UDP ports, L2TPv3
   Session ID's etc.

   The exact specification of the method of selecting an appropriate
   load balance label value is outside the scope of this document.


10.  Client Network Layer Model

   The packet PW appears as a single point to point link to the client
   layer.  Network Layer adjacency formation and maintenance between the
   client equipments will the follow normal practice needed to support
   the required relationship in the client layer.  The assignment of
   metrics for this point to point link is a matter for the client
   layer.  In a hop by hop routing network the metrics would normally be
   assigned by appropriate configuration of the embedded client network
   layer equipment (e.g. the embedded client LSR).  Where the client was
   using the packet PW as part of a traffic engineered path, it is up to
   the operator of the client network to ensure that the server layer
   operator provides the necessary service layer agreement.


11.  Congestion Considerations

   This pseudowire is normally used to carry IP, MPLS and their
   associated support protocols over an MPLS network.  There are no
   congestion considerations beyond those that ordinarily apply to an IP
   or MPLS network.  Where the packet protocol being carried is not IP
   or MPLS and the traffic volumes are greater than that ordinarily
   associated with the support protocols in an IP or MPLS network, the
   congestion considerations being developed for PWs apply [RFC3985],
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch].


12.  Security Considerations

   The packet pseudowire provides no means of protecting the contents or
   delivery of the pseudowire packets on behalf of the client packet
   service.  The packet pseudowire may, however, leverage security
   mechanisms provided by the MPLS Tunnel Layer.  A more detailed
   discussion of pseudowire security is given in [RFC3985], [RFC4447]
   and [RFC3916].

   The Protocol FEC, and corresponding label is only used in the context
   of a packet PW, and it does not change the security implications
   already discussed in [RFC4447].

   the reservation in the registry.

   A FEC element allocation of 0x83 has already be made by IANA.
   However, IANA are requested to up date the registry "Forwarding
   Equivalence Class (FEC) Type Name Space" with a reference to this RFC
   number once the number is allocated.
