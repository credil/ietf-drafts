        This document examines the requirements for Distributed 
        Conferencing (DCON). Separate 	documents will map the requirements 
        to existing protocol primitives, define new protocol extensions, and introduce
        new protocols as needed. Together, these documents will provide a guideline for
        building interoperable conferencing applications.
        The current works in SIPPING and XCON working groups marginally address the
        matter, which is nonetheless considered as out-of-scope. 
        The requirements listed in this document are in part based on thoughts derived
        from the cited working groups activities.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="sec-intro"> 

<t> 

This document examines the requirements for an architecture capable
to provide a distributed conferencing service. It draws inspiration from
a number of existing research efforts inside the IETF, mainly in the context
of both the SIPPING and the XCON WGs. We will herein present high-level 
requirements, starting from considerations upon the well-known concept of
cascaded conferencing <xref target="RFC5239"/><xref target="RFC4575"/>.

In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT 
RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as 
described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/> and

Distributed conferencing uses, when appropriate, and expands on the
terminology introduced in both the SIPPING <xref target="RFC2119"/> and XCON <xref target="RFC5239"/> conferencing frameworks. The following additional terms are defined for specific use within the distributed conferencing work.

</t> 

<t>
Focus Discovery -- this term refers to the capability to detect the presence of new focus entities in a distributed conferencing framework.
</t>

<t>
Information Spreading -- this term refers to the spreading of conference related information among the focus entities in a distributed environment.
</t>

<t>
Protocol Dispatching -- this term refers to the capabilty of appropriately forwarding/distributing messages of a natively centralized protocol in order to let them spread across a distributed environment.
</t>

<t>
DCON Focus -- this term refers to a specific entity enabling communication of a centralized conferencing system with the outside world. A DCON focus allows for the construction of a distributed conferencing system as a federation of centralized conferencing components.
</t>

<t>
Conferencing Cloud -- this term refers to a specific pair composed of a centralized focus entity (XCON) and its associated distributed focus (DCON). We will herein indifferently use both "cloud" and "island" to refer to a conferencing cloud.

<section title="Related work: Cascaded Conferencing" 
anchor="sec-cascaded"> 

<t>
The requirements for a distributed conferencing framework have already been partially addressed in previous works within the IETF.  Specifically, RFC 4245 (High-Level Requirements for Tightly Coupled SIP
Conferencing) <xref target="RFC4245"/> introduces the concept of cascading of conferences and illustrates three different scenarios to which it might be applied: (i) peer-to-peer chaining of signaling; (ii) conferences having hierarchal signaling relations; (iii) cascading as a means to distribute the media "mixing". 
For the three scenarios above, a number of possible requirements are identified, among which the availability of a SIMPLE-based Presence and Instant Messaging architecture plays a major role.
</t>

<t>
The concept of cascaded conferences is further expanded in RFC 4353 <xref target="RFC4353"/> (A Framework for Conferencing with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)), where the term "Cascaded Conferencing" is used to indicate "a mechanism for group communications in  which a set of conferences are linked by having their focuses interact in some fashion". In the same document, a specific scenario called "Simplex Cascaded Conferences" is presented as a typical interaction paradigm envisaging  that the user agent representing the focus of one conference is a conference-unaware participant in another conference.
In other terms, a conference "calls" another conference and gets connected to it as if it were a simple participant. For both such conferences, the  peering party is just like any other user participating in the conferencing session. For the sake of completeness, we remark that the previous observation is somehow confuted by RFC 4575 (A Session Initiation Protocol Event Package for Conference State) <xref target="RFC4353"/>, which explicitely states: 

<list style="hanging">

<vspace blankLines='2'/>

<t>
"It is possible that a participant in the conference may in fact be another focus.  In order to provide a more complete participant list, the focus MAY subscribe to the conference package of the other focus to discover the participant list in the cascaded conference. This information can then be included in notifications by use of the &lt;cascaded-focus&gt; element as specified by this package".
</t>

<t></t>

</list>

Even though the simplex cascaded conferencing is an established way to concatenate conferences, we claim that it is not flexible enough to effectively cope with a number of potential distributed conferencing scenarios. More precisely, we envisage a situation where an overlay network infrastructure is in charge of managing distributed conferences, whereas the sinlge focus entities keep on managing their own centralized "realm". As it will come out in the next section, this entails that a specific requirement is formulated about the need for explicit management of distributed conference information.

</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirements" anchor="sec-requirements"> 

<t> 

In the following we are going to list the requirements we have identified for
distributed conferencing. Each requirement is presented in general terms and
some examples about its applicability are provided.

</t>

<vspace blankLines='2' />

<list style="format REQ-%d:" hangIndent='5'>

<t>

Overlay Creation and Management

<vspace blankLines='1' />

To enable effective operation of the distributed conferencing framework, an overlay network made of all interconnected conferencing clouds MUST be created. As an example, the mentioned overlay MAY be built by interconnecting all focus entities (with each such entity being the root of a local centralized conferencing cloud) through a full-meshed topology. Once the overlay is created, appropriate management of its structure SHOULD be envisaged; this includes, for example, dynamic updating of the topology information at the occurrence of relevant events (grafting/pruning of new centralized conferencing islands, etc.).

</t>

<vspace blankLines='1' />

<t>
Focus Discovery
<vspace blankLines='1' />

An appropriate mechanism for the discovery of peering focus entities SHOULD be  provided. Given the sensitive nature of the shared information, an appropriate authentication mechanism SHOULD be adopted. The trigger of the discovery process MAY be related to the concept of "presence"; in such case, an Instant Messaging (IM) based paradigm is RECOMMENDED. Alternatively, a logically centralized, physically distributed repository (e.g. UDDI) MAY be employed as a single reference point for the discovery of peering entities. A pure peer-to-peer approach can also be exploited for the same purpose.

</t>

<vspace blankLines='1' />

<t>
Self-configuration

<vspace blankLines='1' />

At the occurrence of events like the grafting of a new cloud onto the overlay distributed conferencing network, the needed configuration steps SHOULD be performed in an automated fashion. This entails that all the news are appropriately exchanged across the overlay and, if needed, notified to the underlying centralized clouds as well. 

</t>

<vspace blankLines='1' />

<t>
Information Sharing

<vspace blankLines='1' />

The core of the operation of a distributed conferencing framework resides in the possibility to exchange information among all involved entities. The information sharing process SHOULD be made as effective as possible, e.g. by limiting the information that is forwarded outside a single centralized conferencing cloud to the data that are strictly necessary in order to guarantee that the overall state of the overaly is consistent, yet not redundant. Information sharing MAY be achieved either by exploiting a request/response paradigm, or through the adoption of asynchronous notification messages. A combined use of both the aforementioned paradigms is RECOMMENDED.

</t>

<vspace blankLines='1' />

<t>
Dynamic Update

<vspace blankLines='1' />

All the clouds participating in the distributed overlay MUST keep the peers updated with respect to worth-noting events happening in their local realm. This MAY be achieved either by exploiting a request/response paradigm, or through the adoption of asynchronous notification messages. A combined use of both the aforementioned paradigms is RECOMMENDED. A pure peer-to-peer approach can also be exploited for the same purpose.

</t>

<vspace blankLines='1' />

<t>
Distributed Conference Management

<vspace blankLines='1' />

In order to allow users' access to remotely created conferences, appropriate mechanisms MUST be provided by the framework. Such mechanisms SHOULD enable transparent management of both locally- and remotely-created conference instances. A pure peer-to-peer approach can be exploited for the same purpose.

</t>

<vspace blankLines='1' />

<t>
Centralized Protocols Routing and Dispatching

<vspace blankLines='1' />

Focus entities MUST forward any centralized protocol message 
to their related peer in the distributed overlay whenever the message
is directed to a receiver who does not belong to the local centralized 
system. Natively centralized protocol messages include, but are not limited to, 
any protocol defined and specified in the XCON framework (e.g. 
conference control management and floor control) as well as DTMF 
messages propagation. An example could be BFCP <xref target="RFC4582"/> messages the local floor control server might need to send to a user who is
remotely participating in the conference (because she/he does not belong to the current XCON cloud). Another example concerns BFCP messages a local
user might send to the remote floor control server handling
the remote distributed conference she/he is involved in.
Any message sent by local entities to local entities has to be treated
in the usual centralized way according to the relative protocol 
specifications (i.e. dispatching shall not be involved).

</t>

<vspace blankLines='1' />

<t>
Distributed Mixing
 
<vspace blankLines='1' />

As soon as two or more centralized conferencing islands get connected in order
to provide for a distributed conferencing scenario, the need arises to cope with the issue of mixing media flows generated by the conference participants. This challenging issue is currently considered out-of-scope in this document, which mainly focuses on the distribution of conference signalling/control information rather than addressing media management.

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-security"> 

	<t>
		The communication between each distributed focus entity
		contains sensitive information, since it envisages the possibility
		to spread important data that only authorized parties should
		know (e.g. the full internal state of the centralized conference
		objects and relevant privacy information about users authenticated
		by the system).
	</t>
	
	<t>
		Hence it is very important that protocol messages be protected
		because otherwise an attacker might spoof the legitimate identity of
		the distributed focus entity or inject messages on its behalf. 		
	</t>
	
	<t>
		To mitigate the above threats, all focus entities SHOULD mutually 
		authenticate upon initial contact.  All protocol messages SHOULD be
		authenticated and integrity-protected to prevent third-party intervention
		and MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) attacks. All messages SHOULD be 
		encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.
