1.  Introduction

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) [RFC5921] is the set of protocol
   functions that meet the requirements [RFC5654] for the application of
   MPLS to the construction and operation of packet-switched transport
   networks.  The MPLS-TP data plane consists of those MPLS-TP functions
   concerned with the encapsulation and forwarding of MPLS-TP packets
   and is described in [RFC5960].

   This document presents considerations for link-layer addressing of
   Ethernet frames carrying MPLS-TP packets.  Since MPLS-TP packets are
   MPLS packets, existing procedures ([RFC3032], [RFC5332]) for the
   encapsulation of MPLS packets over Ethernet apply.  Because IP
   functionality is optional in an MPLS-TP network, however, IP-based
   protocols for Media Access Control (MAC) address learning, such as
   the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) [RFC0826] and IP version 6
   Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861], may not be available.  This document
   specifies the options for determination and selection of next-hop
   Ethernet MAC addressing under these circumstances.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Point-to-Point Link Addressing

   When two MPLS-TP nodes are connected by a point-to-point Ethernet
   link, the question arises as to what destination Ethernet Media
   Access Control (MAC) address should be specified in Ethernet frames
   transmitted to the peer node over the link.  The problem of
   determining this address does not arise in IP/MPLS networks because
   of the presence of the Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
   [RFC0826] or IP version 6 Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC4861],
   which allow the unicast MAC address of the peer device to be learned
   dynamically.

   If existing mechanisms are available in an MPLS-TP network to
   determine the destination unicast MAC addresses of peer nodes -- for
   example, if the network also happens to be an IP/MPLS network -- such
   mechanisms SHOULD be used.  The remainder of this section discusses
   the available options when this is not the case.

   Each node MAY be statically configured with the MAC address of its
   peer.  Note however that static MAC address configuration can present
   an administrative burden and lead to operational problems.  For
   example, replacement of an Ethernet interface to resolve a hardware
   fault when this approach is used requires that the peer node be
   manually reconfigured with the new MAC address.  This is especially
   problematic if the peer is operated by another provider.

Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP Ethernet Addressing          October 2011


   The Ethernet broadcast address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF MAY be used as the
   destination MAC address in frames carrying MPLS-TP packets over a
   link that is known to be point-to-point.  This may, however, lead to
   excessive frame distribution and processing at the Ethernet layer.
   Broadcast traffic may also be treated specially by some devices and
   this may not be desirable for MPLS-TP data frames.

   The approach which SHOULD be used, in view of these considerations,
   is therefore to use as the destination MAC address an Ethernet
   multicast address reserved for MPLS-TP for use over point-to-point
   links.  The address allocated for this purpose by the Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is 01-00-5E-XX-XX-XX.  An MPLS-TP
   implementation MUST process Ethernet frames received over a point-to-
   point link with this destination MAC address by default.

   The use of broadcast or multicast addressing is applicable only when
   the attached Ethernet link is known to be point-to-point.  If a link
   is not known to be point-to-point, these forms of addressing MUST NOT
   be used.


3.  Multipoint Link Addressing

   When a multipoint Ethernet link serves as a section [RFC5960] for a
   point-to-multipoint MPLS-TP LSP, and multicast destination MAC
   addressing at the Ethernet layer is used for the LSP, the addressing
   and encapsulation procedures specified in [RFC5332] SHALL be used.

   When a multipoint Ethernet link -- that is, a link which is not known
   to be point-to-point -- serves as a section for a point-to-point
   MPLS-TP LSP, unicast destination MAC addresses MUST be used for
   Ethernet frames carrying packets of the LSP.  According to the
   discussion in the previous section, this implies the use of either
   static MAC address configuration or a protocol that enables peer MAC
   address discovery.


4.  MAC Address Determination via the G-ACh Advertisement Protocol

   The G-ACh Advertisement Protocol (GAP) [I-D.fbb-mpls-gach-adv]
   provides a simple means of informing listeners on a link of the
   sender's capabilities and configuration.  When used for this purpose
   on an Ethernet link, GAP messages are multicast to the address 01-00-
   5e-80-00-0d.  If these messages contain the unicast MAC address of
   the sender, then listeners can learn this address and use it in the
   future when transmitting frames containing MPLS-TP packets.  Since
   the GAP does not rely on IP, this provides a means of unicast MAC
   discovery for MPLS-TP nodes without IP support.

Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP Ethernet Addressing          October 2011


   This document defines a new GAP application, "Ethernet Interface
   Parameters", to support the advertisement of Ethernet-specific
   parameters associated with the sending interface.  It defines several
   Type-Length-Value (TLV) objects for this application, as follows:

      Unicast MAC Address: The Value of this object is a canonical 48-
      bit Ethernet unicast MAC address assigned to one of the interfaces
      of the sender that is connected to this data link.

      Maximum Frame Size: The Value of this object is 32-bit unsigned
      integer encoded in network byte order that specifies the maximum
      frame size supported by the sending interface, in octets.

   [Editor's note: Other objects may be added here.]


5.  Security Considerations

   The use of broadcast or multicast Ethernet destination MAC addresses
   for frames carrying MPLS-TP data packets can potentially result in
   such frames being distributed to devices other than the intended
   destination node or nodes when the Ethernet link is not point-to-
   point.  The operator SHOULD take care to ensure that MPLS-TP nodes
   are aware of the Ethernet link type (point-to-point or multipoint).
   In the case of multipoint links, the operator SHOULD either ensure
   that no devices are attached to the link that are not authorized to
   receive the frames, or take steps to mitigate the possibility of
   excessive frame distribution, for example by configuring the Ethernet
   switch to appropriately restrict the delivery of multicast frames to
   authorized ports.


6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Ethernet Multicast Address Allocation

   IANA is requested to allocate an Ethernet Multicast Address from the
   Ethernet Multicast Addresses table in the ethernet-numbers registry
   for use by MPLS-TP LSRs over point-to-point links as described in
   Section 2.  The entry should specify an address of the form 01-00-5E-
   XX-XX-XX, a Type Field of 8847/8848, and a usage "MPLS-TP point-to-
   point (this draft)".

6.2.  G-ACh Advertisement Protocol Allocation

   IANA is requested to allocate a new Application ID in the "G-ACh
   Advertisement Protocol Applications and Data Types" registry, along
   with several associated data types, as follows:
