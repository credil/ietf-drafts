Abstract

   Some applications using public key certificates can benefit from a
   way to link together a set of certificates belonging to the same end
   entity.  This memo defines a certificate extension that supports such
   linkage.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 3280 [RFC3280] defines a profile for the use of public key
   certificates for Internet applications.  Some applications may
   require a way to link together a set of certificates belonging to the
   same end entity so this memo defines a new public key certificate
   extension that supports such linkage.

   Other than asserting that the set of certificates belong to the same
   end entity, the semantics of the actual linkage of certifcates is not
   defined here, that is a matter for application developers and the
   operators of certification authorities (CAs).  In particular we do
   not define how a CA can validate that the same end entity is the
   holder of the various private keys, nor how any application should
   make use of this information.  This memo simply defines the relevant
   syntax.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  A Use Case

   Public key certificates expire, typically about a year after they are
   created.  Some applications might need to know that the same entity
   is the subject of this certificate and a previously used certificate.

   For example, if a web server certificate expires, it could be useful
   for a web browser to know that the server currently presenting a
   certificate in a TLS [RFC4346] handshake represents the same web
   server that previously presented a certificate.  This could be used
   for example to allow the browser to automatically fill in form fields
   for the server in question, even if the server certificate has been
   replaced.  While the same effect can be achieved based on the use of
   the same issuer and subject fields in a certificate there could be
   security issues involved in such comparisons, e.g. if the subject
   name includes a DNS name and the ownership of that DNS domain has
   changed.

   The use of the new extension provides a way for the CA to signal to
   the application that the same end entity is involved, regardless of
   name changes.  The new extension could also allow the web site
   operator to more easily change CA when renewing its certificate.

3.  Other Certificates Extension

   This section defines the syntax for the other certificates extension.

   The new extension is simply a list of other issuer/serial number
   pairs from the linked certificates.  The IssuerAndSerialNumber
   construct is taken from CMS [RFC3852].

   When this extension is present the CA is asserting that the same end
   entity is the subject of the relevant certificates.  Mechanisms for
   how this assertion is validated by the CA or used by consumers of the
   certificate are out of scope of this memo.

   This extension MUST NOT be marked critical.

   id-ce-otherCerts OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::== { id-ce XXX }

   OtherCertificates ::= SEQUENCE OF IssuerAndSerialNumber


4.  Acknowledgements

   The use case motivating this was contributed to the W3C web security
   context (WSC) working group by Tyler Close.  See
   http://www.w3.org/2006/WSC/wiki/SafeWebFormEditor for details.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   TBD.  Some warnings for CAs and applications needed.
