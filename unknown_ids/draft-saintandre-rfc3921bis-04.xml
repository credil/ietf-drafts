  <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
    <section title="Overview" anchor="intro-overview">
      <t>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an application profile of the Extensible Markup Language <xref target="XML"/> for streaming XML data in close to real time between any two (or more) network-aware entities.  XMPP is typically used to exchange messages, share presence information, and engage in structured request-response interactions.  The core features of XMPP defined in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/> provide the building blocks for many types of near-real-time applications, which may be layered on top of the core by sending application-specific data qualified by particular XML namespaces (refer to <xref target="XML-NAMES"/>).  This document describes XMPP extensions that provide the basic functionality expected of an instant messaging (IM) and presence application as defined in <xref target="IMP-REQS"/>.</t>
      <t>This document obsoletes RFC 3921.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Requirements" anchor="intro-requirements">
      <t>Traditionally, instant messaging applications have combined the following factors:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t><iref item='Roster'/>The central point of focus is a list of one's contacts or "buddies" (in XMPP this list is called a ROSTER).</t>
          <t>The purpose of using such an application is to exchange relatively brief text messages with each of one's contacts in close to real time -- often relatively large numbers of such messages in rapid succession, in the form of one-to-one "chat sessions".</t>
          <t><iref item='Presence'/>The catalyst for exchanging messages is PRESENCE -- i.e., information about the network availability of each of one's contacts (thus knowing who is online and available for a chat session).</t>
          <t>Presence information is provided only to contacts that a user has authorized via a presence subscription.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Thus at a high level this document assumes that a user must be able to complete the following use cases:</t>
      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>Manage items in one's contact list</t>
        <t>Exchange messages with one's contacts</t>
        <t>Exchange presence information with one's contacts</t>
        <t>Manage presence subscriptions to and from one's contacts</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>Detailed definitions of these functionality areas are contained in RFC 2779 <xref target="IMP-REQS"/>, and the interested reader is referred to that document regarding the requirements addressed herein.  While the XMPP instant messaging and presence extensions specified herein meet the requirements of RFC 2779, they were not designed explicitly with that specification in mind, since the base protocol evolved through an open development process within the Jabber open-source community before RFC 2779 was written.  Although XMPP protocol extensions addressing many other functionality areas have been defined in the XMPP Standards Foundation's XEP series (e.g., multi-user text chat as specified in <xref target='XEP-0045'/>), such extensions are not specified in this document because they are not required by RFC 2779.</t>
      <t>Note:  RFC 2779 stipulates that presence services must be separable from instant messaging services and vice-versa; i.e., it must be possible to use the protocol to provide a presence service, an instant messaging service, or both.  Although the text of this document assumes that implementations and deployments will want to offer a unified instant messaging and presence service, there is no requirement that a service must offer both a presence service and an instant messaging service, and the protocol makes it possible to offer separate and distinct services for presence and for instant messaging.  (For example, a presence-only service could return a &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; error if a client attempt to send a &lt;message/&gt; stanzas.)</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Functional Summary" anchor="intro-summary">
      <t>This non-normative section provides a developer-friendly, functional summary of XMPP-based instant messaging and presence features; refer to the sections that follow for a normative definition of these features.</t>
      <t><xref target="XMPP-CORE"/> specifies how an XMPP client connects to an XMPP server.  In particular, it specifies the preconditions that must be fulfilled before a client is allowed to send XML stanzas (the basic unit of meaning in XMPP) to other entities on an XMPP network.  These preconditions comprise negotiation of the XML stream and include XML stream establishment, optional channel encryption via Transport Layer Security <xref target='TLS'/>, mandatory authentication via Simple Authentication and Security Layer <xref target='SASL'/>, and binding of a resource to the stream for client addressing.  The reader is referred to <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/> for details regarding these preconditions, and knowledge of <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/> is assumed herein.</t>
      <t>Upon fulfillment of the preconditions specified in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>, an XMPP client has a long-lived XML stream with an XMPP server, which enables the user to send and receive a potentially unlimited number of XML stanzas over the stream.  Such a stream can be used to exchange messages, share presence information, and engage in structured request-response interactions in close to real time.  After negotiation of the XML stream, the typical flow for an instant messaging and presence session is as follows:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Retrieve one's roster.  (See <xref target='roster-login'/>.)</t>
          <t>Send initial presence to the server for broadcasting to all subscribed contacts, thus "going online" from the perspective of XMPP communications.  (See <xref target='presence-initial'/>.)</t>
          <t>Exchange messages, manage presence subscriptions, perform roster updates, and in general process and generate other XML stanzas with particular semantics throughout the life of the session.  (See <xref target='message'/>, <xref target='sub'/>, <xref target='roster'/>, and <xref target='iq'/>.)</t>
          <t>Terminate the session when desired by sending unavailable presence and closing the underlying XML stream. (See <xref target='presence-unavailable'/>.)</t>
        </list>

    <section title="Conventions" anchor="intro-conventions">
      <t>This document inherits the terminology defined in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>.</t>
      <t>The following keywords are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="TERMS"/>: "MUST", "SHALL", "REQUIRED"; "MUST NOT", "SHALL NOT"; "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED"; "SHOULD NOT", "NOT RECOMMENDED"; "MAY", "OPTIONAL".</t>
      <t>For convenience, this document employs the term "user" to refer to the owner of an XMPP account; however, account owners need not be human persons and may be bots, devices, or other non-human applications.</t>
      <t>In examples, lines have been wrapped for improved readability, "[...]" means elision, and the following prepended strings are used:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>C: = client</t>
          <t>CC: = contact's client</t>

  <section title="Managing the Roster" anchor="roster">
    <t>In XMPP, one's roster contains any number of specific contacts.  A user's roster is stored by the user's server on the user's behalf so that the user may access roster information from any resource.</t>
    <section title="Syntax and Semantics" anchor="roster-syntax">
      <t>Rosters are managed using IQ stanzas, specifically by means of a &lt;query/&gt; child element qualified by the 'jabber:iq:roster' namespace.  The detailed syntax and semantics are defined in the following sections.</t>
      <section title="Items" anchor="roster-syntax-items">
        <t>The &lt;query/&gt; element MAY contain one or more &lt;item/&gt; children, each describing a unique roster item or "contact".</t>
        <t>The syntax of the &lt;item/&gt; is as follows:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='numbers'>
            <t>The 'jid' attribute is REQUIRED; the value of this attribute is Jabber Identifier (JID) that uniquely identifies the roster item.</t>
            <t>The 'name' attribute is OPTIONAL; the value of this attribute specifies the "handle" to be associated with the JID, as determined by the user (not the contact).  The value of the 'name' attribute is typicall opaque to the server but may have meaning to a human user.</t>
            <t>The 'subscription' attribute is OPTIONAL; see <xref target='roster-syntax-subscription'/>.</t>
            <t>The 'ask' attribute is OPTIONAL and is used to specify certain subscription sub-states; for details, see <xref target='sub-request-outbound'/>.</t>
            <t>The &lt;group/&gt; element is OPTIONAL; the XML character data of this element specifies a category into which the roster item should be grouped by a client.  The &lt;item/&gt; MAY more than one &lt;group/&gt; element.  The XML character data of the &lt;group/&gt; element is typicall opaque to the server but may have meaning to a human user.</t>

    <section title="Retrieving the Roster on Login" anchor="roster-login">
      <t>Upon authenticating with a server and binding a resource (thus becoming a connected resource), a client SHOULD request the roster before sending initial presence (however, because receiving the roster may not be desirable for all resources, e.g., a connection with limited bandwidth, the client's request for the roster is recommended and not required).  After a connected resource sends initial presence (see <xref target='presence-initial'/>), it is referred to as an available resource.  If a connected resource requests the roster but does not send initial presence, the server MUST NOT send it presence subscription requests and SHOULD NOT send it associated roster pushes.  If an available resource does not request the roster during a session, the server SHOULD NOT send it presence subscription requests and MUST NOT send it associated roster pushes. Therefore, if a client wishes to engage in the full range of interactions related to contact lists (rosters) and presence subscriptions, it SHOULD both request the roster and send initial presence. <iref item='Interested Resource'/> For the sake of brevity, the term INTERESTED RESOURCE is used herein to refer to the concept of "an available resource that has requested the roster".</t>
      <t>A client requests the roster by sending a roster get over its stream to the server.</t>

  <section title="Managing Presence Subscriptions" anchor="sub">

    <t><iref item='Presence Subscription'/>In order to protect the privacy of instant messaging users, presence information is disclosed only to other entities that the user has approved.  When a user has agreed that another entity may view its presence, the entity is said to have a SUBSCRIPTION to the user's presence.  <iref item='Contact'/>An entity that has a subscription to a user's presence or to which a user has a presence subscription is called a CONTACT (in this document the term "contact" is also used in less strict sense to refer to a potential contact or an item in a user's roster).</t>
    <t>In XMPP, a subscription lasts across sessions; indeed, it lasts until the contact unsubscribes or the user cancels the previously-granted subscription.</t>
    <t>Subscriptions are managed within XMPP by sending presence stanzas containing specially-defined attributes ("subscribe", "unsubscribe", "subscribed", and "unsubscribed").</t>
    <t>Note:  When a server processes or generates an outbound presence stanza of type "subscribe", "subscribed", "unsubscribe", or "unsubscribed", the server MUST stamp the outgoing presence stanza with the bare JID &lt;node@domain&gt; of the sending entity, not the full JID &lt;node@domain/resource&gt;.  This rule helps to prevent presence leaks; for details, see the security considerations of <xref target='XMPP-CORE'/>.</t>

    <section title="Requesting a Subscription" anchor="sub-request">
      <t><iref item='Subscription Request'/>A SUBSCRIPTION REQUEST is a presence stanza whose 'type' attribute has a value of "subscribe".  A subscription request is generated by a user's client, processed by the (potential) contact's server, and acted on by the contact via the contact's client.  The workflow is described in the following sections.</t>
      <section title="Client Generation of Outbound Subscription Request" anchor="sub-request-gen">
        <t>A user's client generates a subscription request by sending a presence stanza of type "subscribe" and specifying a 'to' address of the potential contact's bare JID &lt;contact@domain&gt;.</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
UC: <presence to='juliet@example.com' type='subscribe'/>
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>Typically the user's client prompts the user for information about the potential contact ("handle" and desired roster group) and generates a roster set with that information before sending the subscription request, but that behavior is recommended rather than required.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Server Processing of Outbound Subscription Request" anchor="sub-request-outbound">
        <t>As mentioned, the user's server MUST stamp the outbound subscription request with the bare JID &lt;user@domain&gt; of the user.</t>

        </figure>
        <t>If the potential contact is hosted on the same server, the server MUST adhere to the rules specified in the next section in processing the subscription request and delivering it to the (local) contact.</t>
        <t>If the potential contact is hosted on a different server, the user's server then routes the stanza to that foreign domain in accordance with core XMPP stanza processing rules.</t>
        <t>The user's server MUST then send a roster push to all of the user's interested resources, containing the potential contact with a subscription state of "none" and with notation that the subscription is pending (via an 'ask' attribute whose value is "subscribe").</t>

        <t>Note:  Because the server must send this roster push, a client MAY simply wait for the roster push rather than proactively adding the contact to the user's roster before sending the subscription request.</t>
        <t>Note:  If the contact does not approve or deny the subscription request within some configurable amount of time, the user's server MAY choose to re-send the subscription request to the contact based on an implementation-specific algorithm (e.g., whenever a new resource becomes available for the user, or after a certain amount of time has elapsed); this helps to recover from transient, silent errors that may have occurred in relation to the original subscription request.</t>

            </t>
            <t>If the contact exists and the user already has a subscription to the user's presence, then the contact's server SHOULD auto-reply on behalf of the contact by sending a presence stanza of type "subscribed" from the contact's bare JID to the user's bare JID.  If the contact previously sent a presence stanza of type "subscribed" and the contact's server treated that as indicating "pre-approval" for the user's presence subscription (see <xref target='substates'/>), then the contact's server MAY also auto-reply on behalf of the contact.</t>
            <t>If the contact exists, the user does not already have a subscription to the contact's presence, and there is at least one interested resource associated with the contact when the subscription request is received by the contact's server, the contact's server MUST broadcast that subscription request to all interested resources in accordance with <xref target="rules">Server Rules for Processing XML Stanzas</xref>.</t>
            <t>If the contact exists, the user does not already have a subscription to the contact's presence, and the contact has no interested resources when the subscription request is received by the contact's server, the contact's server MUST keep a record of the complete presence stanza comprising the subscription request, including any extended content contained therein, and deliver the request when the contact next has an interested resource, until the contact either approves or denies the request.  (Note: The contact's server MUST NOT deliver more than one subscription request from any given user when the contact next has an interested resource; e.g., if the user sends multiple subscription requests to the contact while the contact is offline, the contact's server SHOULD store only one of those requests, such as the first request or last request, and MUST deliver only one of the requests when the contact next has an interested resource; this helps to prevent "subscription request spam".)</t>

        <t>In order to subscribe to the user's presence, the contact would then send a subscription request to the user.

Naturally, when the contact sends a subscription request to the user, the subscription states will be different from those shown in the foregoing examples (see <xref target='substates'/>) and the roles will be reversed.</t>

  <section title="Exchanging Presence Information" anchor="presence">

    <section title="Overview" anchor="presence-overview">
      <t>The concept of presence refers to an entity's availability for communication over a network.  At the most basic level, presence is a boolean "on/off" variable that signals whether an entity is available or unavailable for communication (the terms "online" and "offline" are also used).  In XMPP, a principal's availability is signalled when a client controlled by the principal generates a &lt;presence/&gt; stanza with no 'type' attribute, and an entity's lack of availability is signalled when a client generates a &lt;presence/&gt; stanza whose 'type' attribute has a value of "unavailable".  In XMPP-based applications that combine messaging and presence functionality, the default type of communication for which presence signals availability is messaging; however, XMPP-based applications are not required to combine messaging and presence functionality, and can provide standalone presence features without messaging (in addition, XMPP servers do not require information about network availability in order to successfully route message and IQ stanzas).</t>
      <t>XMPP presence typically follows a "publish-subscribe" or "observer" pattern, wherein an entity sends presence to its server, and its server then broadcasts that information to all of the entity's contacts who have a subscription to the entity's presence (in the terminology of <xref target="IMP-MODEL"/>, an entity that generates presence is a "presentity" and the entities that receive presence are "subscribers").  A client generates presence for broadcasting to all subscribed entities by sending a presence stanza to its server with no 'to' address, where the presence stanza has either no 'type' attribute or a 'type' attribute whose value is "unavailable". <iref item='Broadcasted Presence'/> This kind of presence is called BROADCASTED PRESENCE. <iref item='Directed Presence'/> (A client MAY also send DIRECTED PRESENCE, i.e., a presence stanza with a 'to' address; this is less common but is sometimes used to send presence to entities that are not subscribed to the principal's presence; see <xref target='presence-directed'/>.)</t>
      <t><iref item='Presence Session'/>After a client completes the preconditions specified in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>, it can establish a PRESENCE SESSION at its server by sending <xref target='presence-initial'>initial presence</xref>.  Such a presence session is terminated by sending <xref target='presence-unavailable'>unavailable presence</xref>.</t>

    <section title="Initial Presence" anchor="presence-initial">
      <section title="Client Generation of Initial Presence" anchor="presence-initial-gen">
        <t><iref item='Initial Presence'/>After completing the preconditions described in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/> (REQUIRED) and requesting the roster (RECOMMENDED), a client SHOULD signal its availability for communication by sending INITIAL PRESENCE to its server, i.e., a presence stanza with no 'to' address (indicating that it is meant to be broadcasted by the server on behalf of the client) and no 'type' attribute (indicating the user's availability). <iref item='Available Resource'/> After sending initial presence, a connected resource (in the terminology of <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>) is said to be an AVAILABLE RESOURCE.</t>

    <section title="Presence Syntax" anchor="presence-syntax">
      <section title="Type Attribute" anchor="presence-syntax-type">
        <t>The absence of a 'type' attribute signals that the relevant entity is available for communication (see <xref target='presence-initial'/> and <xref target='presence-broadcast'/>).</t>
        <t>A 'type' attribute with a value of "unavailable" signals that the relevant entity is not available for communication (see <xref target='presence-unavailable'/>).</t>
        <t>The XMPP presence stanza is also used to negotiate and manage subscriptions to the presence of other entities.  These tasks are completed via presence stanzas of type "subscribe", "unsubscribe", "subscribed", and "unsubscribed" as described under <xref target='sub'/>.</t>
        <t>If a user and contact are associated with different XMPP servers, those servers also use a special presence stanza of type "probe" in order to determine the availability of the entity on the peer server; for details, see <xref target='presence-probe'/>.  Clients SHOULD NOT send presence stanzas of type "probe".</t>
        <t>The values of the 'type' attribute can be summarized as follows:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>error -- An error has occurred regarding processing of a previously-sent presence stanza; if the presence stanza is of type "error", it MUST include an &lt;error/&gt; child element (refer to <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>).</t>
            <t>probe -- A request for an entity's current presence; SHOULD be generated only by a server on behalf of a user.</t>
            <t>subscribe -- The sender wishes to subscribe to the recipient's presence.</t>
            <t>subscribed -- The sender has allowed the recipient to receive their presence.</t>
            <t>unsubscribe -- The sender is unsubscribing from another entity's presence.</t>
            <t>unsubscribed -- The subscription request has been denied or a previously-granted subscription has been cancelled.</t>
            <t>unavailable -- Signals that the entity is no longer available for communication.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>If the value of the 'type' attribute is not one of the foregoing values, the recipient or an intermediate router SHOULD return a stanza error of &lt;bad-request/&gt;.</t>
        <t>Note:  There is no default value for the 'type' attribute of the &lt;presence/&gt; element.  Therefore if the intended recipient or intermediate router receives a &lt;presence/&gt; element whose 'type' value is undefined, it SHOULD return a stanza error of &lt;bad-request/&gt;.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Child Elements" anchor="presence-syntax-children">
        <t>In accordance with the default namespace declaration, a presence stanza is qualified by the 'jabber:client' or 'jabber:server' namespace, which defines certain allowable children of presence stanzas, in particular the &lt;show/&gt;, &lt;status/&gt;, and &lt;priority/&gt; elements.  These child elements are used to provide more detailed information about an entity's availability.  Typically these child elements are provided only if the presence stanza possesses no 'type' attribute, although exceptions are noted in the text that follows.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Show Element" anchor="presence-show">
        <t>The OPTIONAL &lt;show/&gt; element specifies the particular availability sub-state of an entity or a specific resource thereof.  A presence stanza MUST NOT contain more than one &lt;show/&gt; element.  The &lt;show/&gt; element MUST NOT possess any attributes.  The XML character data of the &lt;show/&gt; element is not human-readable.  The XML character data MUST be one of the following (additional availability states could be defined through a properly-namespaced child element of the presence stanza):</t>
        <t>

            <t>away -- The entity or resource is temporarily away.</t>
            <t>chat -- The entity or resource is actively interested in chatting.</t>
            <t>dnd -- The entity or resource is busy (dnd = "Do Not Disturb").</t>
            <t>xa -- The entity or resource is away for an extended period (xa = "eXtended Away").</t>
          </list>

        <t>The OPTIONAL &lt;status/&gt; element contains human-readable XML character data specifying a natural-language description of an entity's availability.

  <section title="Exchanging Messages" anchor="message">
    <t>Once a client has authenticated with a server and bound a resource to an XML stream as described in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>, an XMPP server will route XML stanzas to and from that client (if, that is, messaging functionality is enabled and the server is not a presence-only service).  One kind of stanza that may be exchanged is &lt;message/&gt;.  Exchanging messages is a basic use of XMPP and occurs when a user generates a message stanza that is addressed to another entity.  As defined under <xref target="rules">Server Rules for Processing XML Stanzas</xref>, the sender's server is responsible for delivering the message to the intended recipient (if the recipient is on the same server) or for routing the message to the recipient's server (if the recipient is on a different server).  Thus a message stanza is used to "push" information to another entity.</t>
    <t>As noted under <xref target='presence-directed'/>, if a user exchanges messages with another entity but does not share presence with the entity based on a presence subscription, it is RECOMMENDED for the user's client to send directed presence to the other entity.</t>
    <t>The following sections describe the syntax of the &lt;message/&gt; stanza.</t>
    <section title="Attributes" anchor="message-attributes">
      <section title="To Attribute" anchor="message-attributes-to">
        <t>An instant messaging client SHOULD specify an intended recipient for a message by providing the JID of an entity other than the sender in the 'to' attribute of the &lt;message/&gt; stanza.</t>
        <t>If the message is being sent outside the context of any existing chat session or received message, the value of the 'to' address SHOULD be of the form &lt;user@domain&gt; rather than of the form &lt;user@domain/resource&gt;.</t>

      <t>Common uses of the message stanza in instant messaging applications include single messages, messages sent in the context of a chat conversation, messages sent in the context of a multi-user chat room, headlines and other alerts, and errors.  These uses are differentiated via the 'type' attribute.  Inclusion of the 'type' attribute is RECOMMENDED.  If included, the 'type' attribute MUST have one of the following values:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>chat -- The message is sent in the context of a one-to-one chat conversation.  A receiving client SHOULD present the message in an interface enabling one-to-one chat between the two parties, including an appropriate conversation history.  (For detailed recommendations regarding chat sessions, refer to <xref target='XEP-0201'/>.)</t>
          <t>error -- The message is generated by an entity that experiences an error in processing a message received from another entity (for details regarding stanza error syntax, refer to <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>).  A client that receives a message of type "error" SHOULD present an appropriate interface informing the sender of the nature of the error.</t>
          <t>groupchat -- The message is sent in the context of a multi-user chat environment (similar to that of <xref target="IRC"/>).  A receiving client SHOULD present the message in an interface enabling many-to-many chat between the parties, including a roster of parties in the chatroom and an appropriate conversation history.  Full definition of XMPP-based groupchat protocols is out of scope for this document (for details, refer to <xref target="XEP-0045"/>).</t>
          <t>headline -- The message is probably generated by an automated service that delivers or broadcasts content (news, sports, market information, syndicated content, alerts, etc.), or the sender wishes the message to be delivered as if it were so generated.  No reply to the message is expected, and a receiving client SHOULD present the message in an interface that appropriately differentiates the message from standalone messages, chat sessions, or groupchat sessions (e.g., by not providing the recipient with the ability to reply).  The receiving server SHOULD deliver the message to all of the recipient's available resources.</t>
          <t>normal -- The message is a standalone message that is sent outside the context of a one-to-one conversation or groupchat, and to which it is expected that the recipient will reply.  A receiving client SHOULD present the message in an interface enabling the recipient to reply, but without a conversation history.  This is the default value of the 'type' attribute.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>An IM application SHOULD support all of the foregoing message types.  If an application receives a message with no 'type' attribute or the application does not understand the value of the 'type' attribute provided, it MUST consider the message to be of type "normal" (i.e., "normal" is the default).</t>
      <t>Although the 'type' attribute is OPTIONAL, it is considered polite to mirror the type in any replies to a message; furthermore, some specialized applications (e.g., a multi-user chat service) MAY at their discretion enforce the use of a particular message type (e.g., type='groupchat').</t>

        <t>The primary use of the XMPP &lt;thread/&gt; element is to uniquely identify a conversation thread or "chat session" between two entities instantiated by &lt;message/&gt; stanzas of type 'chat'.  However, the XMPP &lt;thread/&gt; element may also be used to uniquely identify an analogous thread between two entities instantiated by &lt;message/&gt; stanzas of type 'headline' or 'normal', or among multiple entities in the context of a multi-user chat room instantiated by &lt;message/&gt; stanzas of type 'groupchat'. It may also be used for &lt;message/&gt; stanzas not related to a conversation, such as a game session or between plugins.</t>
        <t>The value of the &lt;thread/&gt; element MUST be a universally unique identifier (UUID) as described in <xref target='UUID'/>.</t>
        <t>The use of the &lt;thread/&gt; element is OPTIONAL.  The &lt;thread/&gt; element is not used to identify individual messages, only conversations.  A message stanza MUST NOT contain more than one &lt;thread/&gt; element.  The &lt;thread/&gt; element MUST NOT possess any attributes.  The value of the &lt;thread/&gt; element is not human-readable and MUST be treated as opaque by entities; no semantic meaning may be derived from it, and only exact comparisons may be made against it.  The &lt;thread/&gt; element MUST NOT contain mixed content (as defined in Section 3.2.2 of <xref target="XML"/>).</t>

  <section title="Exchanging IQ Stanzas" anchor="iq">
    <t>As described in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>, IQ stanzas provide a structured request-response mechanism.  The basic semantics of that mechanism (e.g., that the 'id' attribute is required) are defined in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>, whereas the specific semantics required to complete particular use cases are defined in all cases by the extended namespace that qualifies the direct child element of an IQ stanza of type "get" or "set".  The 'jabber:client' and 'jabber:server' namespaces do not define any children of IQ stanzas other than the &lt;error/&gt; common to all stanza types.  This document defines one such extended namespace, for <xref target="roster">Managing the Roster</xref>.  However, an IQ stanza MAY contain structured information qualified by any extended namespace.</t>
    <t>As noted under <xref target='presence-directed'/>, if a user exchanges IQ stanzas with another entity but does not share presence with the entity based on a presence subscription, it is RECOMMENDED for the user's client to send directed presence to the other entity.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="A Sample Session" anchor="session">
    <t>The examples in this section illustrate a possible instant messaging and presence session.  The user is romeo@example.net, he has an available resource whose resource identifier is "orchard", and he has the following individuals in his roster:</t>
    <t><list style="symbols">
      <t>juliet@example.com (subscription="both" and she has two available resources, one whose resource identifier is "chamber" and another whose resource identifier is "balcony")</t>
      <t>benvolio@example.org (subscription="to")</t>
      <t>mercutio@example.org (subscription="from")</t>
    </list></t>
    <t>First, the user completes the preconditions (stream establishment, TLS and SASL negotiation, and resource binding) described in <xref target='XMPP-CORE'/>; those protocol flows are not reproduced here.</t>

  <section title="Server Rules for Processing XML Stanzas" anchor="rules">
    <t>Basic server rules for processing XML stanzas are defined in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>.  This section defines supplementary rules for XMPP instant messaging and presence servers; in the absence of a supplementary rule defined below (e.g., for stanzas without a 'to' address), the rule defined in <xref target='XMPP-CORE'/> shall apply.</t>
    <section title="No Such User" anchor="rules-nosuchuser">
      <t>If the user account does not exist, how the stanza shall be processed depends on the stanza type.</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>For a message stanza, the server SHOULD return a &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; stanza error to the sender.</t>
          <t>For a presence stanza with no 'type' attribute or a 'type' attribute of "unavailable", the server SHOULD silently ignore the stanza (i.e., not return an error or a presence stanza of type "unsubscribed").</t>
          <t>For a presence stanza of type "subscribe", "subscribed", "unsubscribe", or "unsubscribed", the server MUST follow the guidelines provided under <xref target='sub'/>.</t>
          <t>For an IQ stanza, the server MUST return a &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; stanza error to the sender.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Full JID at Local Domain" anchor="rules-fulljid">
      <t>If the hostname of the domain identifier portion of the JID contained in the 'to' attribute of an inbound stanza matches one of the configured hostnames of the server itself and the JID contained in the 'to' attribute is of the form &lt;user@domain/resource&gt;, the server MUST adhere to the following rules.</t>
      <section title="Available Resource Matches" anchor="rules-fulljid-availmatch">
        <t>If an available resource exactly matches the full JID, the recipient's server MUST deliver the stanza to that resource.</t>
        <t>However, for IQ stanzas of type "get" or "set", if the intended recipient does not share presence with the requesting entity either by means of a presence subscription of type "both" or "from" or by means of directed presence, then the server SHOULD NOT deliver the IQ stanza but instead SHOULD return a &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; stanza error to the requesting entity.  This policy helps to prevent presence leaks (see <xref target='security'/>).</t>
      </section>
      <section title="No Available Resource Matches" anchor="rules-fulljid-availnomatch">
        <t>If no connected or available resource exactly matches the full JID, how the stanza shall be processed depends on the stanza type.</t>

            <t>For a message, the server SHOULD treat the stanza as if it were addressed to &lt;user@domain&gt; as described in the next section.</t>

          <t>For a message stanza of type "headline", the server SHOULD deliver the stanza to all available resources.</t>
          <t>For a message stanza of type "chat", "error", "groupchat", or "normal", the server SHOULD deliver the stanza to the highest-priority available resource. If there is not one highest-priority available resource but instead the highest priority is asserted by two or more available resources, these resources are said to form a "delivery tie".  In the case of a delivery tie, a server SHOULD deliver the message to all of the tied resources.  However, before delivering the message, a server MAY remove one or more resources from the tie.  Methods for doing so are outside the scope of this specification, but could include factors such as the resource's time of connection, time of last network or application activity, availability as determined by some hierarchy of &lt;show/&gt; values, or user-configured rules.  Nevertheless, a server MUST NOT remove all resources from the tie, and MUST deliver the message to at least one of the highest-priority resources.</t>
          <t>However, for any message type the server MUST NOT deliver the stanza to any available resource with a negative priority; if the only available resource has a negative priority, the server SHOULD handle the message as if there were no available resources as described under <xref target='rules-barejid-availno'/>.</t>
          <t>In all cases, the server MUST NOT rewrite the 'to' attribute (i.e., it MUST leave it as &lt;user@domain&gt; rather than change it to &lt;user@domain/resource&gt;).</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Presence" anchor="rules-barejid-availyes-pres">
          <t>For a presence stanza of type "probe", the server MUST handle it directly as described under <xref target='presence-probe'/>.</t>

    <section title="Foreign Domain" anchor="rules-foreign">
      <t>If the hostname of the domain identifier portion of the address contained in the 'to' attribute of an outbound stanza does not match a configured hostname of the server itself, the server MUST attempt to route the stanza to the foreign domain.  If there exists an active stream between the two peers, the server shall route the stanza over that stream for processing by the peer server.  If not, the server MUST do the following.</t>
      <t>First, resolve the hostname of the foreign domain (or use a cached resolution of the foreign domain to an IP address).  The recommended order of attempted resolutions is as follows:</t>
      <t><list style='numbers'>
        <t>Attempt to resolve the foreign hostname using a DNS service location record <xref target="SRV"/> Service of "xmpp-server" and Proto of "tcp", resulting in resource records such as "_xmpp-server._tcp.example.com.", as specified in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>.</t>
        <t>If the "xmpp-server" address record resolution fails, attempt to resolve the "_im" or "_pres" SRV Service as specified in <xref target="IMP-SRV"/>, using the "_im" Service for &lt;message/&gt; stanzas and the "_pres" Service for &lt;presence/&gt; stanzas (it is up to the implementation how to handle &lt;iq/&gt; stanzas).  This will result in one or more resolutions of the form "_im.&lt;proto&gt;.example.com." or "_pres.&lt;proto&gt;.example.com.", where "&lt;proto&gt;" would be a label registered in the Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label registry or the Presence SRV Protocol Label registry: either "_xmpp" for an XMPP-aware domain or some other IANA-registered label (e.g., "_simple") for a non-XMPP-aware domain.</t>
        <t>If both SRV address record resolutions fail, attempt to perform a normal IPv4/IPv6 address record resolution to determine the IP address using the "xmpp-server" port of 5269 registered with the IANA, as specified in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>.</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>If the server cannot resolve the foreign domain, it SHOULD return a &lt;remote-server-not-found/&gt; stanza error.</t>
      <t>Second, negotiate XML streams with the foreign domain by following the process defined in <xref target='XMPP-CORE'/>.  If the server can resolve the foreign domain but cannot establish streams with the XMPP service at that domain, it SHOULD return a &lt;remote-server-timeout/&gt; stanza error.</t>
      <t>Third, route the stanza to the foreign domain for processing by the peer server.</t>
      <t>Note:  Administrators of server deployments are strongly encouraged to keep the _im._xmpp, _pres._xmpp, and _xmpp._tcp SRV records properly synchronized, since different implementations might perform the "_im" and "_pres" lookups before the "xmpp-server" lookup.</t>

  <section title="IM and Presence Compliance Requirements" anchor="compliance">
    <t>This section summarizes the specific aspects of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol that MUST be supported by instant messaging and presence servers and clients in order to be considered compliant implementations.  All such applications MUST comply with the requirements specified in <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>.  The text in this section specifies additional compliance requirements for instant messaging and presence servers and clients (the requirements described here supplement but do not supersede the core requirements).</t>
    <t>Note:  A server or client MAY support only presence or instant messaging, and is not required to support both if only a presence service or an instant messaging service is desired.</t>
    <section title="Servers" anchor="compliance-server">
      <t>In addition to core server compliance requirements, an instant messaging and presence server MUST additionally support all server-related instant messaging and presence syntax and semantics defined in this document, including:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Presence broadcast on behalf of clients as specified under <xref target='presence'/></t>
          <t>Presence subscriptions as specified under <xref target='sub'/></t>

  <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
    <t>Core security considerations for XMPP are defined in the relevant section of <xref target="XMPP-CORE"/>.</t>
    <t>Additional considerations that apply only to instant messaging and presence applications of XMPP are defined in several places within this document; specifically:</t>
    <t><list style="symbols">
      <t>When a server processes an inbound presence stanza of type "probe" whose intended recipient is a user associated with one of the server's hostnames, the server MUST NOT reveal the user's presence if the sender is an entity that is not authorized to receive that information as determined by presence subscriptions (see <xref target="presence">Exchanging Presence Information</xref>).</t>
      <t>A user's server MUST NOT leak the user's network availability to entities who are not authorized to know the user's presence, either via an explicit subscription as described herein or via an existing trust relationship (such as presence-enabled user directories within organizations).</t>
      <t>When a server processes an outbound presence stanza with no type or of type "unavailable", it MUST follow the rules defined under <xref target="presence">Exchanging Presence Information</xref> in order to ensure that such presence information is not broadcasted to entities that are not authorized to know such information.</t>
      <t>When a server generates an error stanza in response to receiving a stanza for a user who does not exist, the use of the &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; error condition helps protect against well-known dictionary attacks, since this is the same error condition that is returned if, for instance, the namespace of an IQ child element is not understood, or if offline message storage or message forwarding is not enabled for a domain.</t>
      <t>A client MAY ignore the &lt;status/&gt; element when contained in a presence stanza of type "subscribe", "unsubscribe", "subscribed", or "unsubscribed" in order to help prevent "presence subscription spam".</t>

<abstract>
<t>Presence and Instant Messaging have recently emerged as a new medium of communications over the Internet.  Presence is a means for finding, retrieving, and subscribing to changes in the presence information (e.g.  "online" or "offline") of other users.  Instant messaging is a means for sending small, simple messages that are delivered immediately to online users.</t>
<t>Applications of presence and instant messaging currently use independent, non-standard and non-interoperable protocols developed by various vendors.  The goal of the Instant Messaging and Presence Protocol (IMPP) Working Group is to define a standard protocol so that independently developed applications of instant messaging and/or   presence can interoperate across the Internet.  This document defines a minimal set of requirements that IMPP must meet.</t></abstract></front>

<date month='October' day='5' year='2007' />
<abstract><t>This document defines the core features of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), a technology for streaming Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements in order to exchange structured information in close to real time between any two or more network- aware entities. XMPP provides a generalized, extensible framework for incrementally exchanging XML data, upon which a variety of applications can be built. The framework includes methods for stream setup and teardown, channel encryption, authentication of a client to a server and of one server to another server, and primitives for push-style messages, publication of network availability information ("presence"), and request-response interactions between any two XMPP entities. This document also specifies the format for XMPP addresses, which are fully internationalizable. This document obsoletes RFC 3920.</t></abstract>

<t>At the time this document was written, numerous presence protocols were in use (largely as components of commercial instant messaging services), and little interoperability between services based on these protocols has been achieved. This specification defines common semantics and data formats for presence to facilitate the creation of gateways between presence services. [STANDARDS TRACK] </t></abstract></front>

<t>&lt;p>The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework for providing authentication and data security services in connection-oriented protocols via replaceable mechanisms. It provides a structured interface between protocols and mechanisms. The resulting framework allows new protocols to reuse existing mechanisms and allows old protocols to make use of new mechanisms. The framework also provides a protocol for securing subsequent protocol exchanges within a data security layer.&lt;/p>&lt;p> This document describes how a SASL mechanism is structured, describes how protocols include support for SASL, and defines the protocol for carrying a data security layer over a connection.

   This memo defines the profile of the MIME Content-Type  for
   directory information for a white-pages person object, based on a
   vCard electronic business card.  The profile definition is independent
   of any particular directory service or protocol.  The profile is
   defined for representing and exchanging a variety of information
   about an individual (e.g., formatted and structured name and delivery
   addresses, email address, multiple telephone numbers, photograph,
   logo, audio clips, etc.).  The directory information used by this
   profile is based on the attributes for the person object defined in
   the X.520 and X.521 directory services recommendations.  The profile
   also provides the method for including a  representation of a
   white-pages directory entry within the MIME Content-Type defined by
   the  document.

    <t>This section provides detailed information about subscription states and server processing of subscription-related presence stanzas (i.e., presence stanzas of type "subscribe", "subscribed", "unsubscribe", and "unsubscribed").</t>
    <section title="Defined States" anchor="substates-defined">
      <t>There are four primary subscription states (note: these states are described from the perspective of the user, not the contact):</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
        <t>None -- the user does not have a subscription to the contact's presence, and the contact does not have a subscription to the user's presence</t>
        <t>To -- the user has a subscription to the contact's presence, but the contact does not have a subscription to the user's presence</t>
        <t>From -- the contact has a subscription to the user's presence, but the user does not have a subscription to the contact's presence</t>
        <t>Both -- both the user and the contact have subscriptions to each other's presence (i.e., the union of 'from' and 'to')</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>These states are supplemented by various pending sub-states to yield nine possible subscription states:</t>
      <t><list style='numbers'>

        <t>"None + Pending In" = contact and user are not subscribed to each other, and contact has sent user a subscription request but user has not replied yet (note: contact's server SHOULD NOT push or deliver roster items in this state, but instead SHOULD wait until user has approved subscription request from contact); this is reflected in the user's roster by subscription='none'</t>
        <t>"None + Pending Out+In" = contact and user are not subscribed to each other, contact has sent user a subscription request but user has not replied yet, and user has sent contact a subscription request but contact has not replied yet; this is reflected in the user's roster by subscription='none' and ask='subscribe'</t>
        <t>"To" = user is subscribed to contact (one-way); this is reflected in the user's roster by subscription='to'</t>

        <t>[1] A server MAY note the fact that the user wishes to allow the contact to be subscribed to the user's presence and automatically approve any subscription request received from the contact; if it does so, upon the receiving presence stanza of type "subscribed" from the user's client it MUST add a roster item for the contact to the user's roster and set the 'ask' flag to a value of "subscribed".  However, the user's server still SHOULD NOT route the presence stanza of type "subscribed" to the contact.  This optional functionality applies only if the contact is not already in the user's roster or if the contact is in the user's roster with a state of "None" (not including a state of "None + Pending Out").</t>

An XML representation of the vCard specification defined in <xref target="VCARD">RFC 2426</xref> is in common use within the Jabber community to provide such information but is out of scope for XMPP (documentation of this protocol is contained in <xref target="XEP-0054"/>).</t>

    <section title="Differences From RFC 3921" anchor="diffs">
      <t>Based on consensus derived from implementation and deployment experience as well as formal interoperability testing, the following substantive modifications were made from RFC 3921.</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>The protocol for session establishment was determined to be unnecessary and therefore the content previously defined in Section 3 of RFC 3921 was removed.  However, server implementations may still want to advertise support for the feature in order to ensure backward-compatibility, even though session establishment is a "no-op".</t>
          <t>The protocol for communications blocking specified in Section 10 of RFC 3921 has been moved to <xref target='XEP-0016'/>.</t>
          <t>In order to more seamlessly repair lack of synchronization in subscription states between rosters located at different servers, error handling related to presence probes and presence notifications was modified to return presence stanzas of type "unsubscribe" or "unsubscribed" rather than error stanzas.</t>
          <t>Added optional server support for pre-approved presence subscriptions via presence stanzas of type "subscribed" and the optional "subscribed" value for the 'ask' flag.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>In addition, numerous changes of an editorial nature were made in order to more fully specify and clearly explain the protocols.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Copying Conditions" anchor="copying">
      <t>The Contributor grants third parties the irrevocable right to copy, use and distribute the Contribution, with or without modification, in any medium, without royalty, provided that, unless separate permission is granted, redistributed modified works:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>do not contain misleading author, version, name of work, or endorsement information, and</t>
          <t>do not claim endorsement of the modified work by the Contributor, or any organization the Contributor belongs to, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), Internet Architecture Board (IAB), Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), Internet Society (ISOC), Request For Comments (RFC) Editor, or any combination or variation of such terms (including without limitation the IETF "4 diamonds" logo), or any terms that are confusingly similar thereto, and</t>
          <t>remove any claims of status as an Internet Standard, including without limitation removing the RFC boilerplate.</t>
        </list>
