Abstract

   IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide connectivity between sites
   across an IP backbone. These VPNs can be supported using BGP/MPLS and
   the connections can be created by using MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE)
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs).

   In order to support multiple MPLS-TE based BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs that are
   interconnected via the same Provider Edge (PE) routers, new RSVP 
   extensions are required. This document outlines the requirements 
   and proposes a solution for interconnecting multiple BGP/IP-VPNs 
   via the same Provider Edge router.

1. Introduction

   Some Service Providers would like to use BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs to support
   connections between Customer Edge (CE) sites. These connections can
   be established using MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs). [RFC3209] defines extensions to RSVP for establishing a
   customer LSP using MPLS. In order to establish a customer MPLS-TE LSP
   over BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs, it is necessary for the RSVP control messages,
   including Path messages and Resv messages described in [RFC3209], to
   be appropriately handled by the Provider Edge (PE) routers. The
   requirements for supporting BGP/MPLS RSVP-TE based IP-VPNs are
   documented in [RFC5824].

   [RFC6016] defines the new types of existing objects (i.e. SESSION,
   SENDER_TEMPLATE, FILTERSPEC and RSVP_HOP) described in [RFC2205] to
   establish reservations for customer flows in the context of a
   BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs. Section 7.4 (Support for CE-CE RSVP-TE) of
   [RFC6016], describes the procedure used in this draft.

   In order to support multiple MPLS-TE based BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs that are
   interconnected via the same Provider Edge (PE) routers, new RSVP 
   extensions are required. This document outlines the requirements and
   proposes a solution for interconnecting multiple BGP/IP-VPNs via the
   same Provider Edge router. 


2. Motivation

   If multiple MPLS-TE based BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs are interconnected via 
   the same Provider Edge (PE) router, new RSVP extensions are 
   required. These extensions are necessary so that RSVP control
   messages from the Customer Edge (CE) equipment, such as Path messages
   and Resv messages, are appropriately handled by the PE routers. 
  
2.1 Network Example

   Customer MPLS TE LSPs in the context of BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs are shown in
   Figure 1 (Customer MPLS TE LSPs in the context of BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs). 
   
   Here, we make the following set of assumptions.

   1. VPN1 and VPN2 are completely different customers.
   2. CE1 and CE3 are head-end routers.
   3. CE2 and CE4 are tail-end routers.
   4. A same address (e.g., 192.0.2.1) is assigned at CE2 and CE4.

     Figure 1: Customer MPLS TE LSPs in the context of BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs

   Consider that customers in VPN1 and VPN2 would like to establish a
   customer MPLS TE LSP between their sites (i.e., between CE1 and CE2,
   between CE3 and CE4). In this situation the following RSVP-TE
   Path messages would be sent:

      1. CE1 would send a Path message to PE1 to establish
         the MPLS TE LSP (VPN1) between CE1 and CE2.

      2. CE3 would also send a Path message to PE1 to establish
         the MPLS TE LSP (VPN2) between CE1 and CE2.

   After receiving each Path messages, PE1 can identify each
   Path message from each incoming interface. Afterwards, PE1
   forwards the messages to PE2 by routing information described in
   [RFC4364] and [RFC4659]. However, the current RSVP control message
   specification [RFC3209] does not specify how PE2 is able to identify
   each Path message (i.e., the Path message for VPN1 and VPN2).
   Additionally, Resv messages per VPN sent from PE2 cannot be
   identified at PE1.

3. Protocol Extensions and Procedures

   In order to distinguish between the VPN1 Path/Resv messages and the
   VPN2 Path/Resv messages described in Section 2.3. (Network Example),
   an identifier in Path/Resv messages is required. 
   
   This section provides the additional objects that extend RSVP
   to meet the requirements defined in Section 2.2 (Requirements). 
   These new object types are SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE and FILTERSPEC 
   object. These new objects will act as identifiers and allow PEs to
   distinguish Path/Resv messages per VPN in the context of BGP/MPLS 
   IP-VPNs. The new object types are defined in Section 3.1 
   (Object Definitions) and the specific procedure is described in 
   Section 3.2 (Handling).
    
3.1 Object Definitions

3.1.1 LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 and LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 SESSION Object

   The LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 (or VPN-IPv6) SESSION object appears in RSVP
   messages that ordinarily contain a SESSION object and are sent
   between ingress PE and egress PE in either direction. The object MUST
   NOT be included in any RSVP messages that are sent outside of the
   provider's backbone.

   The LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 SESSION object is analogous to the
   LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 SESSION object, using a VPN-IPv6 address
   ([RFC4659]) instead of a VPN-IPv4 address ([RFC4364]).

   The formats of the objects are as follows:

   Class = SESSION, LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 C-Type = TBA


    0                   1                   2                   3

   The VPN-IPv4 tunnel sender address (respectively, VPN-IPv6 tunnel
   sender address) field contains an address of the VPN-IPv4
   (respectively, VPN-IPv6) address family encoded as specified 
   in [RFC4364] (respectively, [RFC4659]).

   The LSP ID is identical to the LSP ID field in the LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4
   and LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 SENDER_TEMPLATE objects as 
   per [RFC3209].

3.1.3 LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 and LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 FILTER_SPEC Objects

   The LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 (or VPN-IPv6) FILTER_SPEC object appears in
   RSVP messages that ordinarily contain a FILTER_SPEC object and are
   sent between ingress PE and egress PE in either direction (such as
   Resv, ResvError, and ResvTear).  The object MUST NOT be included in
   any RSVP messages that are sent outside of the provider's backbone.

      Class = FILTER SPECIFICATION, LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 C-Type = TBA

   The format of the LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 FILTER_SPEC object is identical
   to the LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 SENDER_TEMPLATE object.

      Class = FILTER SPECIFICATION, LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 C-Type = TBA

   The format of the LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 FILTER_SPEC object is identical
   to the LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 SENDER_TEMPLATE object.

3.1.4 VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 RSVP_HOP Objects

   The format of the VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 RSVP_HOP objects are
   identical to objects described in [RFC6016].

3.2 Handling

   It assumes that ingress PEs and egress PEs in the context of BGP/MPLS
   IP-VPNs have RSVP capabilities.

3.2.1 Path Message Processing at Ingress PE

   When a Path message arrives at the ingress PE (PE1 in Figure 1), the
   PE needs to establish suitable Path state and forward the Path
   message on to the egress PE (PE2 in Figure 1). In this section
   we described the message handling process at the ingress PE.

      1. CE1 would send a Path message to PE1 to establish the MPLS TE
         LSP (VPN1) between CE1 and CE2. The Path message
         is addressed to the eventual destination (the receiver at the
         remote customer site) and carries the IP Router Alert option,
         in accordance with [RFC2205].  The ingress PE must recognize
         the router alert, intercept these messages and process them
         as RSVP signalling messages.

      2. When the ingress PE receives a Path message from a CE that is
         addressed to the receiver, the VRF that is associated with the
         incoming interface can be identified (this step does not
         deviate from current behavior).

      3. The tunnel end point address of the receiver is looked up in
         the appropriate VRF, and the BGP Next-Hop for that tunnel end
         point address is identified. The next-hop is the egress PE.
         
K.Kumaki, et al.                                              [Page 8]
 
draft-kumaki-murai-l3vpn-rsvp-te-02                         July 2011

      4. A new LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 SESSION object is
         constructed, containing the Route Distinguisher (RD) that is
         part of the VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 route prefix for this tunnel end
         point address, and the IPv4/IPv6 tunnel end point address from
         the original SESSION object.

      5. A new LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-Pv4/IPv6 SENDER_TEMPLATE object is
         constructed, with the original IPv4/IPv6 tunnel sender address
         from the incoming SENDER_TEMPLATE plus the RD that is used by
         the PE to advertise the prefix for the customers VPN.

      6. A new Path message is sent containing all the objects from the
         original Path message, replacing the original SESSION and
         SENDER_TEMPLATE objects with the new
         LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 type objects. This Path message is
         sent directly to the egress PE (the next hop as being looked up
         in step 3 above) without IP Router Alert.

3.2.2 Path Message Processing at Egress PE

   In this section we described the message handling process at the
   egress PE.

       1. When a Path message arrives at the egress PE (PE2 in Figure 1)
          , it is addressed to the PE itself, and is handed to RSVP for
          processing.

       2. The router extracts the RD and IPv4/IPv6 address from the
          LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 SESSION object, and determines
          the local VRF context by finding a matching VPN-IPv4 prefix
          with the specified RD that has been advertised by this router
          into BGP.

       3. The entire incoming RSVP message, including the VRF
          information, is stored as part of the Path state.

       4. The egress PE can now construct a Path message which differs
          from the Path message it received in the following ways:

            a.  Its tunnel end point address is the IP address extracted
                from the SESSION object;

            b.  The SESSION and SENDER_TEMPLATE objects are converted
                back to IPv4-type/IPv6-type by discarding the attached
                RD;

            c. The RSVP_HOP object contains the IP address of the
               outgoing interface of the egress PE and an LIH, as per
               normal RSVP processing.

        5. The egress PE then sends the Path message on towards its
           tunnel end point address over the interface identified above.
           This Path message carries the IP Router-Alert option as
           required by [RFC2205].

draft-kumaki-murai-l3vpn-rsvp-te-02                         July 2011

3.2.3 Resv Processing at Egress PE

   When a receiver at the customer site originates a Resv message for
   the session, normal RSVP procedures apply until the Resv, making its
   way back towards the sender, arrives at the "egress" PE (it is
   "egress" with respect to the direction of data flow, i.e.  PE2 in
   figure 1).  On arriving at PE2, the SESSION and FILTER_SPEC objects
   in the Resv, and the VRF in which the Resv was received, are used to
   find the matching Path state stored previously.

   The PE constructs a Resv message to send to the RSVP HOP stored in
   the Path state, i.e., the ingress PE (PE1 in Figure 1).  The LSP
   TUNNEL IPv4/IPv6 SESSION object is replaced with the same
   LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 SESSION object received in the Path. The
   LSP TUNNEL IPv4/IPv6 FILTER_SPEC object is replaced with a
   LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 FILTER_SPEC object, which copies the
   VPN-IPv4/VPN-IPv6 address from the LSP TUNNEL SENDER_TEMPLATE
   received in the matching Path message.

   The Resv message MUST be addressed to the IP address contained within
   the RSVP_HOP object in the Path message.

3.2.4 Resv Processing at Ingress PE

   Upon receiving a Resv message at the ingress PE (with respect to data
   flow, i.e.  PE1 in Figure 1), the PE determines the local VRF context
   and associated Path state for this Resv by decoding the received
   SESSION and FILTER_SPEC objects.  It is now possible to generate a
   Resv message to send to the appropriate CE.  The Resv message sent to
   the ingress CE will contain LSP TUNNEL IPv4/IPv6 SESSION and LSP
   TUNNEL FILTER_SPEC objects, derived from the appropriate Path state.

3.2.5 Other RSVP Messages

   Processing of other RSVP messages, i.e., PathError, PathTear, 
   ResvError, ResvTear, and ResvConf message in general follows the 
   rules defined in [RFC2205], with additional rules that MUST be 
   observed for messages transmitted within the VPN, i.e., between the
   PEs as follows:

   o The SESSION, SENDER_TEMPLATE, and FILTER_SPEC objects MUST be 
     converted from LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4/LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 [RFC3209] to 
     LSP_TUNNEL_VPN_IPv4/LSP_TUNNEL_VPN_IPv6 form, respectively, and
     back in the same manner as described above for Path and Resv 
     messages.
     
K.Kumaki, et al.                                             [Page 10]
 
draft-kumaki-murai-l3vpn-rsvp-te-02                         July 2011

   o The appropriate type of RSVP_HOP object (VPN-IPv4 or VPN-IPv6) MUST
     be used as described in Section 8.4 of [RFC6016].

   o Depending on the type of RSVP_HOP object received from the 
     neighbor, the message MUST be MPLS encapsulated or IP encapsulated.

   o The matching state and VRF MUST be determined by decoding the 
     corresponding RD and IPv4 (respectively, IPv6) address in the 
     SESSION and FILTER_SPEC objects.

   o The message MUST be directly addressed to the appropriate PE, 
     without using the Router Alert Option.


4. Management Considerations

   MPLS-TE based BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs are based on a peer model. If an 
   operator would like to configure a new site to an existing VPN 
   configuration of both the CE router and the attached PE router is 
   required. The operator is not required to modify the configuration
   of PE routers connected to other sites or modify the configuration
   of other VPNs.

4.1 Impact on Network Operation

   It is expected that the use of the extensions specified in this
   document will not significantly increase the level of operational
   traffic.    
   
   Furthermore, the additional extensions described in this document 
   will have no impact on the operation of existing MPLS-TE resiliency 
   mechanisms available within MPLS-TE.
    
5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines RSVP-TE extensions for BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs. Hence
   the security of the RSVP-TE extensions relies on the security of
   RSVP-TE extensions for LSP tunnels.

   The security issues are described in the existing RSVP-TE extensions
   for LSP tunnels. [RFC3209]

draft-kumaki-murai-l3vpn-rsvp-te-02                         July 2011

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains a registry of RSVP parameters. As described in Section
   3 (Protocol Extensions and Procedures) six new Class Types (C-types)
   have been defined. IANA is requested to make the following
   allocations from the "RSVP C-Types" sub-registry:

   Class = SESSION, LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 C-Type = TBA
   Class = SESSION, LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 C-Type = TBA
   Class = SENDER_TEMPLATE, LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 C-Type = TBA
   Class = SENDER_TEMPLATE, LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 C-Type = TBA
   Class = FILTER SPECIFICATION, LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv4 C-Type = TBA
   Class = FILTER SPECIFICATION, LSP_TUNNEL_VPN-IPv6 C-Type = TBA
