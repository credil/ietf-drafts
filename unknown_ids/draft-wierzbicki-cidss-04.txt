Abstract 

   The purpose of the Common Intrusion Detection Signatures Standard 
   (CIDSS) is to define a common data format for storing signatures from 
   different intrusion detection systems. 

   This Internet-Draft describes a common data format to represent 
   information contained in signatures of intrusion detection systems,

   and explains the rationale for using this common format. The proposed 
   format is a dialect of the Extensible Markup Language (XML). An XML 
   Document Type Definition is developed, and examples are provided.

1. Introduction 

1.1. About CIDSS 

   Common Intrusion Detection Signatures Standard is intended to be a 
   standard format of signatures used widely in Network Intrusion 
   Detection Systems (NIDS). An IDS is controlled by a set of decision 
   rules. A decision rule of an IDS is composed of two components: a 
   description of specific characteristics of an intrusion attempt (a 
   signature) and an action that has to be carried out when the data 
   provided by IDS sensors matches the signature. This document focuses 
   on the remaining part of an IDS decision rule: the IDS signature. 

   Currently, every IDS uses a different format of signatures. CIDSS 
   defines a common format of signatures that attempts to express all

   information contained in signatures of various IDS. The CIDSS 
   signature format is based on XML to facilitate the adaptation and 
   applications of the proposed standard. The CIDSS signature format is 
   designed to be extensible, and therefore it SHOULD be simple to 
   incorporate features of future and current IDS systems that have not 
   been taken into account in the first design. 

   The main goal of CIDSS is to enable administrators of IDS systems to 
   share, compare, evaluate and criticize signatures used to detect 
   intrusion events. The increasingly dynamic, global, and frequent 
   nature of intrusion attempts is a trend that forces administrators to 
   greater efforts to protect increasingly valuable information. The 
   possibility to disseminate knowledge and experience about IDS 
   systems' operation would be enhanced by the introduction of a common 
   signature format. Therefore the use of a common IDS signature format 
   SHOULD lead to a greater security of information. Other possible 
   applications of CIDSS will be discussed in the next section.

1.2. Potential Applications of CIDSS 

   One of the main applications of CIDSS is the translation of 
   signatures between various IDS. The ability to translate a signature 
   of an IDS into the common data format and to carry out a reverse 
   translation implies that it SHOULD be possible to translate 
   signatures of different IDS using the common data format as an 
   intermediate form. The development of this standard has been carried 
   out in parallel with the development of an IDS signature translator. 
   Currently, the translator is able to translate signatures of Snort 
   [4] and Dragon [6] IDS into the common format, and among the three 
   systems. It's also partially tested with: Shoki [7], ISS 
   RealSecure(TM) [8], and Cisco NetRanger(TM) [9]. 

   The IDS translator is developed under the GNU General Public License 
   and is available from http://translator.b59.net. 

   Another possible application of CIDSS would be the creation and 
   maintenance of signature databases by independent providers of IDS 
   signatures. The use of XML as a base for the common signature format 
   enables a simple integration of collections of signatures into a 
   database. This SHOULD improve the searching and management of a 
   signature collection. The business model of an independent signature 
   provider could be the delivery of up-to-date, comprehensive signature

   platforms.

2. XML CIDSS Signatures 

   This section describes the logical and structural rules for creating 
   signatures in CIDSS format. Each XML element and attribute used in 
   the CIDSS format are described and explained on examples. In appendix 
   A, a full CIDSS signature is provided that has been used to provide 
   the examples used in this section. 

   CIDSS meets XML ver. 1.0 requirements [2]. CIDSS is defined as a 
   dialect of XML using the XML Schema Definition (XSD). The schema of 
   CIDSS is an appendix to this document (see appendix B: CIDSS XSD 
   schema. cidss.xsd)

2.1. Structure of a CIDSS document 

   A CIDSS document is a collection of signatures. Each signature is 
   independent, and can be stored in a separate CIDSS document or 
   together with other signatures. The main XML element of a CIDS 
   document is the "Signatures" element. 

    

2.2. Structure of a CIDSS signature 

   A CIDSS signature is composed of several XML elements, contained in a 
   common "Signature" element. A signature can be divided into two 
   basic, logical parts. The first part, that includes (among others) 
   the elements "Sources", "Destinations", "Protocols" and "Patterns", 
   is used to define building blocks of a signature definition. These 
   blocks are combined in the second part of a signature, and are kept 
   separate in order to shorten the signature definition and avoid 
   redundancy. For instance, the definition of relevant information 
   about the TCP protocol might be kept inside the "Protocols" element 
   and might be later combined with several patterns (defined inside the 
   "Patterns" element). Rather than repeat the definition of the TCP 
   protocol each time a new pattern is used, the signature definition 
   will refer to the information kept inside the "Protocols" element. 

   The second part of a signature contains information on how to use the 
   building blocks defined in the first part. The main XML element of 
   the second part of a signature is the "Session" element. A "Session" 
   element defines the main signature behavior. A signature MAY use 
   state managed by the IDS for a certain flow of packets (or session). 
   However, it is possible to create stateless signatures, by omitting 
   information REQUIRED for the state mechanisms to work. Then, the 
   information contained in a "Session" element defines the conditions 
   that MUST be fulfilled by sensor data in order to trigger the 
   signature. 

   In the second part of a signature, the information contained in the 
   first part is combined using logical expressions. Each element in the 
   first part of a signature that contains a "building block" for the 
   signature definition MUST have an identifier that is unique in the 
   signature (not necessarily in the CIDSS document that contains the 
   signature). This identifier can be used in the second part of a 
   signature to refer to the "building block" defined by this element. 
   The building blocks MAY be combined using logical expressions that 
   are constructed by the "AND" and "OR" operators. The logical 
   expressions are contained in special tags, and are treated as strings

   by the XML parser. CIDSS logical expressions are described in section 
   2.4. 

   When the content of element contain "<" (less then), ">" (greater 
   then), "&" (ampersand), "'" (apostrophe) or """ (quotation mark) 
   signs, it MUST be put into CDATA section. A CDATA section starts with 
   "<![CDATA[" and ends with "]]>". 

   Only the characters "<" and "&" are strictly illegal in XML. 
   Apostrophes, quotation marks and greater than signs are legal, but it 
   is a good habit to replace them. 

   Note: A CDATA section cannot contain the string "]]>" 

    

2.3. Data types used by the Pattern_Content element 

   The data types used in CIDSS signatures are compatible with the XML 
   [2] and XML Schema (XSD) [3] specification. The following data types 
   are supported: 
   - String value 

   You MUST use encoding defined by "encoding" attribute (e.g. <?xml 
   version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>). UTF-8 RECOMMENDED. Refer to 
   Appendix A and Appendix B 
   - Hexadecimal values 
   - Decimal values 

    

2.4. Logical expressions used in CIDSS signature definitions 

   Some elements in the CIDSS signature contain information that 
   describes how other elements MUST be combined in the signature 
   definitions. The content of these elements is a String value that 
   contains a logical expression. A translating software MUST be able to 
   process these expressions. 

   CIDSS logical expressions MUST use operators "AND", "OR", and "NOT" 
   (uppercase). The operators are interpreted as follows: 
   - AND  -  logical conjunction 
   - OR   -  logical alternative 
   - NOT  -  logical negation 

   The operator precedence in CIDSS logical expressions MUST be 
   interpreted as follows: NOT precedes AND precedes OR.

Internet-Draft                  CIDSS                   September 2008 
    

   CIDSS logical expressions MAY contain ordinary braces "(" or ")" that 
   are interpreted as in logical expressions.  

   Apart from braces and operators, CIDSS logical expressions MUST 
   contain unique identifiers of other XML elements in the CIDSS 
   signature definition that MAY be used in logical expressions. 

    

2.5. XML elements and attributes used in CIDSS 

   In this section, all XML elements defined by the CIDSS standard SHALL 
   be introduced. Each element will be defined using a common template 
   to simplify a presentation. This template is explained below: 

   Element name 
      Element description. 
      Presence: [mandatory | optional, single | multiple] 
      Location: element name 
      Attributes: attribute name [type [, unique]] 
      Contained elements: element names  

   mandatory - means that the element MUST exist in the signature 

   optional - the element MAY exist in the signature 

   single - if the element exists in the signature, then this element 
   MUST exist in exactly one instance 

   multiple - if the element exists in the signature, then this element 
   MAY exist many instances 

   unique - value of the element MUST NOT be repeated as value of the 
   same element in other place 

    

2.5.1. Signatures 

   A root element of a CIDSS XML document. 

   Presence: mandatory, single 
   Location: root element

   If this element is present in Session_Identification, packets that 
   will be included in the session MUST have been sent in the same 
   direction as the starting packet. 

   Type: Boolean 
   Presence: single, optional 
   Location:  Session_Identification 

   Session_Instructions 

   This element works like a switch statement for the state mechanism of 
   an IDS. The information contained in this element defines the 
   statefull behavior of an IDS for this session. The element contains 
   several Session_Case elements that include conditions for the case to 
   apply, as well as instructions to be carried out if the case applies.

   For efficiency reasons, it is assumed that all conditions for state 
   instructions will be brought down into a conjunctive normal form (a 
   logical expression that includes alternatives only at the highest 
   level). That means that in every case element, all case conditions 
   are treated as a logical conjunction (logical AND). This ought to 
   simplify the processing of these instructions.  

   Location: Session 
   Presence: single, optional 
   Contained elements: Session_Case [multiple] 

   Session_Case 

   This element contains the conditions and instructions of a case in 
   the switch statement that is defined by the containing 
   Session_Instructions element. For readability, the conditions are 
   split up into three groups: additional conditions for sensor data 
   that MUST be satisfied so that the packet will apply to this case, 
   the direction of the packet, and the conditions that MUST be 
   satisfied by the state variables of a session in order for the case 
   to apply. The instructions of a case are contained in the mandatory 
   Case_State_Instructions element. 

   Location: Session_Instructions 
   Presence: multiple 
   Contained elements: Case_Filter [single, optional], Direction 
   [single, optional], Case_State_Condition [single, optional], 
   Case_State_Instructions [single, mandatory] 

   Case_Filter 

   Contains IDs of Source, Destination, Protocol or Pattern elements, 
   combined using logical expressions in the format described in section 
   2.4. The information contained in this element specifies the 
   conditions that MUST be met by sensor data so that the packet will 
   apply to this case. 

   Location: Session_Case 
   Presence: single, optional 
   Allowed values: CIDSS logical expressions. 

   Direction 

   Defines a direction of network traffic, once a source and destination 
   of traffic are specified (e.g. after the start of a session). Allowed 
   values are: "sd" and "ds". If direction value is "sd" it means that 
   the packet has been sent from source to destination. If the value of

   this element is "ds" it means that traffic goes from destination to 
   source. 

   Allowed values: sd|ds 
   Default value: sd 
   Location: Session_Case 
   Presence: single, optional 

   Case_State_Condition 

   This element contains conditional state expressions that MUST all be 
   satisfied (evaluate to a boolean value of "true") in order for the 
   case to apply. These instructions MAY check the values of state 
   variables stored by the IDS for this session. 

   Location: Session_Case 
   Presence: single, optional 
   Contained elements: Isset_Var, Compare_Var 

   Case_State_Instructions 

   This element contains state instructions that MUST all be 
   sequentially carried out by the IDS if the case applies. These 
   instructions MAY set, unset or modify the values of state variables 
   stored by the IDS for this session. 

   Location: Session_Case 
   Presence: single, optional 
   Contained elements: Set_Var, Unset_Var, Isset_Var, Isnotset_Var, 
   Compare_Var, Toggle_Var 

   Isset_Var 

   A conditional state expression that evaluates to a boolean value of 
   "true" if the variable of a name that is specified in the "var" 
   attribute is set in the state of this session. 

   Location: Case_State_Condition 
   Presence: multiple, optional 
   Attributes: var [type: string; single, mandatory] 

   Isnotset_Var 

   A conditional state expression that evaluates to a boolean value of 
   "true" if the variable of a name that is specified in the "var" 
   attribute is not set in the state of this session.

3. Conventions used in this document 

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 

4. Security Considerations 

   This Internet Draft describes the CIDSS format for storing 
   information about IDS signatures. The applications of this standard 
   can raise security concerns, but there is no security concerns 
   related strictly to the document format. 

   It is RECOMMENDED that a system for storing CIDSS data SHOULD be 
   protected against unauthorized access and unauthorized use. The means 
   for achieving this protection are outside the scope of this document. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA issues in this document. 

   The RFC Editor may remove this section prior to publication.
