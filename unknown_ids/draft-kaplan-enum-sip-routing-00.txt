Internet-Draft           ENUM for SIP Routing                July 2010 
 
 
Abstract
    
   A common ENUM use-case is for hop-by-hop or domain-by-domain 
   "routing" of SIP requests, using private DNS trees and servers.  
   This document describes this use-case and the need for a source-
   based query/answer mechanism for such.

1. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  The 
   terminology in this document conforms to RFC 2828, "Internet 
   Security Glossary". 
    
   For the purposes of this document and sake of simplicity, only the 
   ENUM/DNS NAPTR URI result for a SIP URI is discussed, but it applies 
   to H.323 and other URIs as well. 
    
   Prefix: in this document, the term "prefix" is just some arbitrary 
   number of the leading digits of an E.164 number, such as the country 
   code, or country plus region, or even including the local exchange 
   portion.  It does not mean additional pre-pended digits used only 
   for internal routing but which are not part of the called/calling 
   number, for which the term "prefix" is also commonly used. 
    
2. Introduction 
    
   The E.164 number to URI DDDS (ENUM) application provides a mapping 
   from E.164-based "names" to various URIs, including SIP, H.323, and 
   others, as defined in [RFC3761].  The reader is assumed to be 
   familiar with ENUM and its normative documents.

Internet-Draft           ENUM for SIP Routing                July 2010 
 
 
   The goal of this document is to describe one of the common uses of 
   ENUM today: SIP Request Routing.  SIP Routing using ENUM generally 
   works very well, but it still missing one important capability: 
   source-based results.  This source-based routing problem is 
   described in this document, without describing the solution.  A 
   solution has been proposed in another draft, [source-uri], which has 
   since expired but has been implemented by multiple vendors and is in 
   use.  A forthcoming draft is expected to propose the same mechanism 
   again. 
    
   When it was originally created, ENUM DNS entries were intended to be 
   under the authority of the entity or person identified by the E.164 
   number, and be something the end user could populate.  For example, 
   for SIP the resultant URI would be the user's global SIP Address-of-
   Record URI, or even a specific SIP Contact URI of the user's SIP 
   User-Agent host.  This model is sometimes called "End User ENUM".  
   In practice, this model has seen fairly limited deployment or use, 
   for numerous reasons which will not be enumerated in this document. 
    
   Another model called "Infrastructure ENUM" or "Carrier ENUM", 
   described in [RFC5526], changes the authority model of the ENUM DNS 
   entries to make the registrant be the carrier-of-record, as opposed 
   to the end user.  In the Infrastructure ENUM model, the returned URI 
   was intended to represent a "point of interconnection" into the 
   carrier-of-record's SIP domain, such as an SBE. 
    
   While there are deployments of Infrastructure ENUM, in practice it 
   is not often deployed as originally defined.  The public DNS 
   database cannot reasonably be usable for URIs which represent 
   specific points of interconnection or ingress, because such URIs are 
   rarely usable in a global context; only carriers with direct access 
   to the interconnection points can use such URIs to reach the 
   carrier-of-record, and even then the interconnection points would be 
   different per originating carrier. 
    
   One could use specific DNS "views" for Infrastructure ENUM, to 
   return different answers per querying carrier IP Address range, but 
   that is difficult to accomplish in the public DNS, in a scalable 
   manner.  A more reasonable URI to return from the public DNS 
   database would be a globally reachable SIP Address-of-Record, but 
   one for which the carrier-of-record is the registrant.  
   Unfortunately, even that type of URI is difficult to use; both 
   because many carriers do not wish to publish such data in a public 
   database, and because in practice few Address-of-Records are 
   actually globally, directly, and publicly reachable. 
    
   An alternative model, often called "Private ENUM", is widely 
   deployed.  Private ENUM uses the DNS Protocol, but not the public 
   DNS Database.  Instead, the database either uses a private domain

   suffix/apex reserved for this purpose and known to all participants, 
   or is provided by local DNS servers which do not tie into the public 
   IANA-based tree, or more commonly both privacy tactics are used.  
   The Private ENUM DNS servers typically reside in a private or 
   restricted IP network, and only accessible to specific clients.  
   Such clients are typically constrained to be ones owned and managed 
   by the carrier, such as SIP Proxies, Application Servers, PSTN 
   Gateways, Soft-switches, and Session Border Controllers.  
    
   Unlike Infrastructure ENUM, Private ENUM DNS database entries are 
   not registered and populated by the carrier-of-record for a given 
   E.164 number.  Instead, the private database's administrator (the 
   local carrier) directly provisions the entries for all E.164 numbers 
   it cares about, based on various indirect information data sources, 
   and sets the entry URI values relative to their specific "view".   
    
   In some cases the resolved URI still does not represent a point of 
   interconnection, such as when it is just used for Number Portability 
   or Calling Name resolution; in other cases it represents a specific 
   interconnection point: either for the peering SBE(s) or tandem PSTN 
   Gateway(s).  The interconnection URI identifies either a host, or 
   possibly also a Trunk Group.  When Private ENUM is used for local 
   interconnection point resolution for SIP requests, it is typically 
   described as providing an "ENUM Routing" service, or as "SIP Routing 
   using ENUM".   
    
   SIP routing based on private-ENUM resolution has been gaining ground 
   in some large SIP operator networks.  However, a need has arisen to 
   respond with different ENUM responses based on the source 
   originating number or domain of the SIP request.  For example, it is 
   often cheaper to route calls from local source prefix numbers to 
   other local prefixes numbers in a given region directly, whereas 
   out-of-region sources going to the same destination numbers of the 
   same carrier may be cheaper or even legally required to be sent 
   through an interexchange or transit provider, or even the PSTN.  
   Another example is in transit and federation carriers, where calls 
   coming from specific previous-peers need to be routed to different 
   next-peers, for the same destination number, usually due to 
   regulatory or billing-related reasons. 
    
   Another example is in interconnection traffic between carriers, 
   where calls coming from a specific region need to be routed through 
   specific routes or border elements to the terminating or next-peer, 
   usually due to billing and commercial-related reasons. 
   Another example is with specific destination numbers, such as 
   premium rate numbers, where calls towards these specific destination 
   numbers need to be routed, based on the originating region or 
   ingress border element, to a specific destination node or a specific

   border element to a next-peer, usually due to operational and 
   capacity management issues. 
    
   Today such source-based routing with ENUM is performed through 
   various means, which are usually cumbersome and error-prone.  These 
   mechanisms typically require the Private ENUM clients and servers to 
   agree on a common scheme, and thus require every SIP Proxy to know 
   and use the same proprietary scheme, which leads to interoperability 
   problems. 
    
   A common example is where the SIP Proxies performing the lookup 
   change the ENUM base domain name suffix based on the source E.164 
   number leading digits, and thus the ENUM-DNS servers have a separate 
   zone per source prefix.  Such a scheme needs to be fixed and common; 
   for example that a 7-digit prefix length always be used for the name 
   suffix, instead of for only specific source or destination numbers; 
   the relevant source prefix cannot be a different length for 
   different numbers, prefixes, or call flows. 
    
   Another example is where the ENUM server returns all possible NAPTR 
   entries in the DNS response, with proprietary indicators in the 
   NAPTR URIs for the client SIP Proxy to choose from, using the SIP 
   source information it has.  The problem with this approach is that 
   the same selection algorithm needs to be supported by all clients, 
   and the DNS response size can grow very, very large.  For example, 
   some routing tables in North America need to have entries for 
   hundreds of North American Numbering Plan (NANP) area codes and 
   local-exchange prefixes, for the same destination number.  
    
    
    
3. Security Considerations 
    
   There are no specific security issues for this mechanism, beyond 
   those already applicable to DNS and ENUM.  
    
    
4.   IANA Considerations 
    
   This document makes no request of IANA.
