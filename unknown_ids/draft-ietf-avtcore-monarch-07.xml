    <abstract>
      <t>This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTCP with a new RTCP
      XR (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding media
      transmission or reception quality, following RTCP guideline established
      in RFC5968. This memo suggests that a new block should contain a single
      metric or a small number of metrics relevant to a single parameter of
      interest or concern, rather than containing a number of metrics which
      attempt to provide full coverage of all those parameters of concern to a
      specific application. Applications may then "mix and match" to create a
      set of blocks which covers their set of concerns. Where possible, a
      specific block should be designed to be re-usable across more than one
      application, for example, for all of voice, streaming audio and
      video.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>As more users and subscribers rely on real time application services,
      uncertainties in the performance and availability of these services are
      driving the need to support new standard methods for gathering
      performance metrics from RTP applications. These rapidly emerging
      standards, such as RTCP XR <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> and other RTCP
      extension to Sender Reports (SR), Receiver Reports (RR) <xref
      target="RFC3550"></xref> are being developed for the purpose of
      collecting and reporting performance metrics from endpoint devices that
      can be used to correlate the metrics, provide end to end service
      visibility and measure and monitor Quality of Experience (QoE).</t>

      <t>However the proliferation of RTP/RTCP specific metrics for transport
      and application quality monitoring has been identified as a potential
      problem for RTP/RTCP interoperability, which attempt to provide full
      coverage of all those parameters of concern to a specific application.
      Since different applications layered on RTP may have some monitoring
      requirements in common, therefore these metrics should be satisfied by a
      common design.</t>

      <t>The objective of this document is to define an extensible RTP
      monitoring framework to provide a small number of re-usable Quality of
      Service (QoS)/QoE metrics which facilitate reduced implementation costs
      and help maximize inter-operability. RTCP Guideline <xref
      target="RFC5968"></xref> has stated that, where RTCP is to be extended
      with a new metric, the preferred mechanism is by the addition of a new
      RTCP XR <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> block. This memo assumes that any
      requirement for a new metric to be transported in RTCP will use a new
      RTCP XR block.</t>

          metrics is the QoE Metric specified in QoE metric reporting Block
          <xref target="MQ"></xref>. <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

          <t hangText="End System metrics"><vspace blankLines="1" />Metrics

    <section title="RTP monitoring architecture">
      <t>The RTP monitoring architecture comprises the following two key
      functional components shown below:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Monitor</t>

          <t>Metric Block Structure</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Monitor is the functional component defined in the Real-time
      Transport Protocol (RTP) <xref target="RFC3550"></xref> that acts as a
      source of information gathered for monitoring purposes. It may gather
      such information reported by RTCP XR or other RTCP extension and
      calculate statistics from multiple source. According to the definition
      of monitor in the RTP Protocol <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>, the end
      system that source RTP streams, an intermediate-system that forwards RTP
      packets to End-devices or a third party that does not participate in the
      RTP session (i.e., the third party monitor depicted in figure 1) can be
      envisioned to act as the Monitor within the RTP monitoring
      architecture.</t>

      <t>The Metric Block exposes real time Application QoS/QoE metric
      information in the appropriate report block format to the management
      system within the RTP monitoring architecture. Such information can be
      formulated as:<list style="symbols">
          <t>The direct metrics</t>

          <t>or the composed metrics.</t>
        </list>or formulated as <list style="symbols">

          <t>or cumulative metrics</t>

          <t>or sampled metrics.</t>
        </list>Both the RTCP or RTCP XR can be extended to convey these
      metrics. The details on transport protocols for metric blocks are
      described in <xref target="sec2"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="Issues with reporting metric block using RTCP XR extension">
      <t>Issues that have come up in the past with reporting metric block
      using RTCP XR extensions include (but are probably not limited to) the
      following:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Using large block. A single report block or metric is designed to
          contain a large number of parameters in different classes for a
          specific application. For example, the RTCP Extended Reports (XRs)
          <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> defines seven report block formats
          for network management and quality monitoring. Some of these block
          types defined in the RTCP XRs <xref target="RFC3611"></xref> are
          only specifically designed for conveying multicast inference of
          network characteristics (MINC) or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring.
          However different applications layered on RTP may have different
          monitoring requirements. Design large block only for specific
          applications may increase implementation cost and minimize
          interoperability.</t>

          <t>Correlating RTCP XR with the non-RTP data. CNAME defined in the
          RTP Protocol <xref target="RFC3550"></xref> is an example of
          existing tool that allows to bind an SSRC that may change to a fixed
          source name in one RTP session. It may be also fixed across multiple
          RTP sessions from the same source. However there may be situations
          where RTCP reports are sent to other participating endpoints using
          non-RTP protocol in a session. For example, as described in the SIP
          RTCP Summary Report Protocol <xref target="RFC6035"></xref>, the
          data contained in RTCP XR VoIP metrics reports <xref
          target="RFC3611"></xref> are forwarded to a central collection
          server systems using SIP. In such case, there is a large portfolio
          of quality parameters that can be associated with real time
          application,e.g., VOIP application, but only a minimal number of
          parameters are included on the RTCP-XR reports. Therefore
          correlation between RTCP XR and non-RTP data should be concerned if
          administration or management systems need to rely on the mapping
          RTCP statistics to non-RTCP measurements to conducts data analysis
          and creates alerts to the users. Without such correlation, it is
          hard to provide accurate measures of real time application quality
          with a minimal number of parameters included on the RTCP-XR reports
          in such case.</t>

          <t>Measurement Information duplication. Measurement information
          provides information relevant to a measurement reported in one or
          more other block types. For example we may set a metric interval for
          the session and monitor RTP packets within one or several
          consecutive metric interval. In such case, the extra meaurement
          information (e.g., extended sequence number of 1st packet,
          measurement period) may be expected. However if we put such extra
          measurement information into each metric block, there may be
          situations where an RTCP XR packet containing multiple metric
          blocks, reports on the same streams from the same source. In other
          words, duplicated data for the measurement is provided multiple
          times, once in every metric block. Though this design ensures
          immunity to packet loss, it may bring more packetization complexity
          and the processing overhead is not completely trivial in some cases.
          Therefore compromise between processing overhead and reliability
          should be taken into account.</t>

          <t>Consumption of XR block code points. The RTCP XR block namespace
          is limited by the 8-bit block type field in the RTCP XR header.
          Space exhaustion may be a concern in the future. We therefore may
          need a way to extend the block type space, so that new
          specifications may continue to be developed.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Guideline for reporting metric block using RTCP XR">
      <section anchor="smallblock" title="Using single metrics blocks">
        <t>Different applications using RTP for media transport certainly have
        differing requirements for metrics transported in RTCP to support
        their operation. For many applications, the basic metrics for
        transport impairments provided in RTCP SR and RR packets <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref> (together with source identification provided
        in RTCP SDES packets) are sufficient. For other applications
        additional metrics may be required or at least sufficiently useful to
        justify the overheads, both of processing in endpoints and of
        increased session bandwidth. For example an IPTV application using
        Forward Error Correction (FEC) might use either a metric of
        post-repair loss or a metric giving detailed information about
        pre-repair loss bursts to optimise payload bandwidth and the strength
        of FEC required for changing network conditions. However there are
        many metrics available. It is likely that different applications or
        classes of applications will wish to use different metrics. Any one
        application is likely to require metrics for more than one parameter
        but if this is the case, different applications will almost certainly
        require different combinations of metrics. If larger blocks are
        defined containing multiple metrics to address the needs of each
        application, it becomes likely that many different such larger blocks
        are defined, which becomes a danger to interoperability.</t>

        <t>To avoid this pitfall, this memo proposes the use of small RTCP XR
        metrics blocks each containing a very small number of individual
        metrics characterizing only one parameter of interest to an
        application running over RTP. For example, at the RTP transport layer,
        the parameter of interest might be packet delay variation, and
        specifically the metric "IPDV" defined by <xref
        target="Y1540"></xref>. See <xref target="example"></xref> for
        architectural considerations for a metrics block, using as an example
        a metrics block to report packet delay variation.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Correlating RTCP XR with the non-RTP data">
        <t>There may be situation where more than one media transport
        protocols are used by one application to interconnect to the same
        session in the gateway. For example, one RTCP XR Packet is sent to the
        participating endpoints using non- RTP-based media transport (e.g.,
        using SIP) in a VOIP session, one crucial factor lies in how to handle
        their different identities that are corresponding to different media
        transport.</t>

        <t>This memo proposes an approach to facilitate the correlation of the
        RTCP Session with other session-related non-RTP data. That is to say
        if there is a need to correlate RTP sessions with non-RTP sessions,
        then the correlation information needed should be conveyed in a new
        RTCP Source Description (SDES) item ,since such correlation
        information describes the source, rather than providing a quality
        report. An example use case is for a participant endpoint may convey a
        call identifier or a global call identifier associated with the SSRC
        of measured RTP stream . In such case, the participant endpoint uses
        the SSRC of source to bind the call identifier using SDES item in the
        SDES RTCP packet and send such correlation to the network management
        system. A flow measurement tool that is configured with the 5-tuple
        and not call-aware then forward the RTCP XR reports along with the
        SSRC of the measured RTP stream which is included in the XR Block
        header and 5-tuple to the network management system. Network
        management system can then correlate this report using SSRC with other
        diagnostic information such as call detail records.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Reducing Measurement information repetition">
        <t>When multiple metric blocks are carried in one RTCP XR packet,
        reporting on the same stream from the same source for the same time
        period, RTCP should use the SSRC to identify and correlate the
        multiple metric blocks between metric blocks. This memo proposes to
        define a new XR Block that will be used to convey the common time
        period and the number of packets sent during this period [MI]. If the
        measurement interval for a metric is different from the RTCP reporting
        interval, then this measurement duration in the [MI] SHOULD be used to
        specify the interval. In order to reduce measurement information
        repetition in one RTCP XR compound packet containing multiple metric
        blocks, the measurement information shall be sent before the related
        metric blocks that are from the same reporting interval. Note that for
        packet loss robustness if the report blocks for the same interval span
        over more than one RTCP packet then each must have the measurement
        identity information even if though they will be the same.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Expanding the RTCP XR block namespace">
        <t>The consumption of XR block code points isn't a major issue.
        However if XR block codes points is really close to run out of space,
        it might be desirable to define new fields in the XR report block or
        define one XR block type for vendor-specific extensions, with an
        enterprise number included to identify the vendor making the
        extension.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="example" title="An example of a metric block">
      <t>This section uses the example of an existing proposed metrics block
      to illustrate the application of the principles set out in <xref
      target="smallblock"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The example <xref target="PDV"></xref> is a block to convey
      information about packet delay variation (PDV) only, consistent with the
      principle that a metrics block should address only one parameter of
      interest. One simple metric of PDV is available in the RTCP RR packet as
      the "interarrival jitter" field. There are other PDV metrics which may
      be more useful to certain applications. Two such metrics are the IPDV
      metric (<xref target="Y1540"></xref>, <xref target="RFC3393"></xref>)
      and the MAPDV2 metric <xref target="G1020"></xref>. Use of these metrics
      is consistent with the principle in Section 5 of RTCP guideline <xref
      target="RFC5968"></xref> that metrics should usually be defined
      elsewhere, so that RTCP standards define only the transport of the
      metric rather than its nature. The purpose of this section is to
      illustrate the architecture using the example of <xref
      target="PDV"></xref> rather than to document the design of the PDV
      metrics block or to provide a tutorial on PDV in general.</t>

      <t>Given the availability of at least three metrics for PDV, there are
      design options for the allocation of metrics to RTCP XR blocks:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>provide an RTCP XR block per metric</t>

          <t>provide a single RTCP XR block which contains all three
          metrics</t>

          <t>provide a single RTCP block to convey any one of the three
          metrics, together with a identifier to inform the receiving RTP
          system of the specific metric being conveyed</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In choosing between these options, extensibility is important,
      because additional metrics of PDV may well be standardized and require
      inclusion in this framework. The first option is extensible but only by
      use of additional RTCP XR blocks, which may consume the limited
      namespace for RTCP XR blocks at an unacceptable rate. The second option
      is not extensible, so could be rejected on that basis, but in any case a
      single application is quite unlikely to require transport of more than
      one metric for PDV. Hence the third option was chosen. This implies the
      creation of a subsidiary namespace to enumerate the PDV metrics which
      may be transported by this block, as discussed further in <xref
      target="PDV"></xref> .</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="topologies" title="Application to RFC 5117 topologies">
      <t>The topologies specified in <xref target="RFC5117"></xref> fall into
      two categories. The first category relates to the RTP system model
      utilizing multicast and/or unicast. The topologies in this category are
      specifically Topo-Point-to-Point, Topo- Multicast, Topo-Translator (both
      variants, Topo-Trn-Translator and Topo-Media-Translator, and
      combinations of the two), and Topo-Mixer. These topologies use RTP end
      systems, RTP mixers and RTP translators defined in the RTP protocol
      <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>. For purposes of reporting connection
      quality to other RTP systems, RTP mixers and RTP end systems are very
      similar. Mixers resynchronize packets and do not relay RTCP reports
      received from one cloud towards other cloud(s). Translators do not
      resynchronize packets and SHOULD forward certain RTCP reports between
      clouds. In this category, the RTP system (end system, mixer or
      translator) which originates, terminates or forwards RTCP XR blocks is
      expected to handle RTCP, including RTCP XR, according to the RTP
      protocol <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>. Provided this expectation is
      met, an RTP system using RTCP XR is architecturally no different from an
      RTP system of the same class (end system, mixer, or translator) which
      does not use RTCP XR. The second category relates to deployed system
      models used in many H.323 <xref target="H323"></xref> video conferences.
      The topologies in this category are Topo-Video-Switch-MCU and
      Topo-RTCP-terminating-MCU. Such topologies based on systems do not
      behave according to the RTP protocol <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Considering the MCU and translator are two typical topologies in the
      two categories mentioned above, this document will take them as two
      typical examples to explain how RTCP XR report works in different
      RFC5117 topologies.</t>

      <section title="Applicability to MCU">
        <t>Topo-Video-Switch-MCU and Topo-RTCP-terminating-MCU, suffer from
        the difficulties described in [RFC5117]. These difficulties apply to
        systems sending, and expecting to receive, RTCP XR blocks as much as
        to systems using other RTCP packet types. For example, a participant
        RTP end system may send media to a video switch MCU. If the media
        stream is not selected for forwarding by the switch, neither RTCP RR
        packets nor RTCP XR blocks referring to the end system's generated
        stream will be received at the RTP end system. Strictly the RTP end
        system can only conclude that its RTP has been lost in the network,
        though an RTP end system complying with the robustness principle of
        [RFC1122] should survive with essential functions (i.e.,media
        distribution) unimpaired.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="txlat" title="Applicability to Translators">
        <t>Section 7.2 of the RTP protocol <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>
        describes processing of RTCP by translators. RTCP XR is within the
        scope of the recommendations of the RTP protocol <xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>. Some RTCP XR metrics blocks may usefully be
        measured at, and reported by, translators. As described in the RTP
        protocol <xref target="RFC3550"></xref> this creates a requirement for
        the translator to allocate an SSRC for the monitor collocated with
        itself so that the monitor may populate the SSRC in the RTCP XR packet
        header as packet sender SSRC and send it out(although the translator
        is not a Synchronisation Source in the sense of originating RTP media
        packets). It must also supply this SSRC and the corresponding CNAME in
        RTCP SDES packets.</t>

        <t>In RTP sessions where one or more translators generate any RTCP
        traffic towards their next-neighbour RTP system, other translators in
        the session have a choice as to whether they forward a translator's
        RTCP packets. Forwarding may provide additional information to other
        RTP systems in the connection but increases RTCP bandwidth and may in
        some cases present a security risk. RTP translators may have
        forwarding behaviour based on local policy, which might differ between
        different interfaces of the same translator.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>There is no IANA action in this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document focuses on the RTCP reporting extension using RTCP XR
      and should not give rise to any new security vulnerabilities beyond
      those described in RTCP XRs <xref target="RFC3611"></xref>. However it
      also describes the architectural framework to be used for monitoring at
      RTP layer. The security issues with monitoring needs to be
      considered.</t>

      <t>In RTP sessions, a RTP system may use its own SSRC to send its
      monitoring reports towards its next-neighbour RTP system. Other RTP
      system in the session may have a choice as to whether they forward this
      RTP system's RTCP packets. This present a security issue since the
      information in the report may be exposed by the other RTP system to any
      malicious node. Therefore if the information is considered as sensitive,
      the monitoring report should be encrypted.</t>

      <t>Also note that the third party monitors are not visible at the RTP
      layer since they do not send any RTCP packets. In order to prevent any
      sensitive information leakage, the monitoring from the third party
      monitors should be prohibited unless the security is in place to
      authenticate them.</t>
