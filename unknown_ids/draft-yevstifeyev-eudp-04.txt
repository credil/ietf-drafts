INTERNET DRAFT                    EUDP                 December 28, 2010


1.  Introduction

   UDP is one of the most widely-used transport-level protocol. One of
   the things which makes it so popular is its simplicity. However in
   some cases this causes lack of facilities, which can be provided  by
   other protocols, such as TCP (see RFC 793 [RFC793]) or DCCP (see RFC
   4340 [RFC4340]). During the history of UDP some attempts have been
   made to improve it by adding some features (for instance UDP-Lite
   (see RFC 3828 [RFC3828])), but these proposals were too specific and
   did not gain popularity.

   EUDP, protocol, proposed by this document, is intended to be a
   universal solution, which combines simplicity of UDP and
   extensibility of TCP by adding an options space to UDP header.  

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol Description

2.1. Lower Layer Protocols Considerations

   EUDP is a transport-layer protocol, and the protocol directly under
   it is IP. EUDP supports as IPv4, as IPv6 as lower-layer protocol. The
   IP Protocol number to be used with EUDP is TBD1.

2.2. Packet Format

2.2.1. Header

   The EUDP header is shown in the figure 1.

2.2.2. Fields

   Source Port (16 bits) - REQUIRED field which is defied and is to be
   used as described in UDP specification - RFC 768 [RFC768]. EUDP uses
   the same port set as UDP.

   Destination Port (16 bits) - REQUIRED field which is defied and is to
   be used as described in UDP specification - RFC 768 [RFC768]. EUDP
   uses the same port set as UDP.

   Data Offset (16 bits) - REQUIRED field which is the number of 32 bit
   words in the EUDP Header. The EUDP header (even one including
   options) MUST be an integral number of 32 bits long.

   Checksum (16 bits) - REQUIRED field which is defied and is to be used

   as described in UDP specification - RFC 768 [RFC768].

   Options (variable length) - OPIONAL field, that is used to carry EUDP
   options in. EUDP option are described in Section 2.3. 

   Padding (variable length) - OPTIONAL field. The EUDP header padding
   is used to ensure that the EUDP header ends and data begins on a 32
   bit boundary. The padding is composed of zeros.

2.3. EUDP Options

2.3.1. Generic Description

   EUDP options are placed into the 'Options' header field. Options may
   occupy space at the end of the EUDP header and are a multiple of 8
   bits in length. All options are included in the checksum. An option
   may begin on any octet boundary. There are two cases for the format
   of an option:

     a) a single octet of option-kind.

     b) an octet of option-kind, an octet of option-length, and the
     actual option-data octets. The option-length counts the two octets
     of option-kind and option-length as well as the option-data octets.

   Note that the list of options may be shorter than the data offset
   field might imply. The content of the header beyond the 'End Of
   Options List' option must be header padding (i.e., zero).

   All options can be 'mandatory' or 'optional' for support. EUDP nodes
   MUST support all 'mandatory' options. Support of 'optional' options
   is OPTIONAL.

   Pre-defied options are specified in Section 2.3.2.

2.3.2. Pre-Defined Options

   This section specifies pre-defined EUDP options.

2.3.2.1. 'No Operation' Option

   +--------+
   | Kind=0 |
   +--------+

   This option may be used between options, for example, to align the
   beginning of a subsequent option on a word boundary.

   The option is 'mandatory' for support.

2.3.2.2. 'End Of Options List' Option

   +--------+
   | Kind=1 |
   +--------+

   This option code indicates the end of the option list. This might not
   coincide with the end of the EUDP header according to the Data Offset
   field. This is used at the end of all options, not the end of each
   option, and need only be used if the end of the options would not
   otherwise coincide with the end of the EUDP header.

   The option is 'mandatory' for support.

2.3.2.3. 'Echo Request' Option

   +--------+--------+-------//-------+
   | Kind=2 | Length |      Data      |
   +--------+--------+-------//-------+

   The 'Echo Request' option is used to provide the possibility of echo
   debugging using the EUDP. The 'Data' part of option may consist of
   arbitrary octets. The receiver of the packet with this option MUST
   answer with the packet with 'Echo response' option (see Section
   2.3.2.4).

   The option is 'mandatory' for support.

2.3.2.4. 'Echo Response' Option

   +--------+--------+-------//-------+
   | Kind=3 | Length |      Data      |
   +--------+--------+-------//-------+

   The 'Echo Response' option is used to answer the packets with 'Echo
   Request' option. The packet consisting 'Echo Response' option MUST be
   send after receiving any EUDP packet with 'Echo Request' option. The
   'Data' part of the option MUST be the same as in received 'Echo
   Request' option.

   The option is 'mandatory' for support.

2.3.2.5. 'Packet Identifier' Option

   +--------+--------+--------+-------+
   | Kind=4 |Length=4|    Packet ID   |
   +--------+--------+--------+-------+

   The 'Packet Identifier' option is asked to request the acknowledgment
   of the single packet. The 'Packet ID' field is filled by arbitrary
   bytes by the sender of the packet with this option. The receiver of
   the packet with 'Packet Identifier' option MUST answer with the
   packet with 'Packet Acknowledgment' option (see Section 2.3.2.6). See
   Section 2.5 for details.

   The option is 'mandatory' for support.

2.3.2.6. 'Packet Acknowledgment' Option 

   +--------+--------+--------+-------+
   | Kind=5 |Length=4| ACK Packet ID  |
   +--------+--------+--------+-------+

   The 'Packet Acknowledgment' option is used to answer the packets with
   'Packet Identifier' option. The 'ACK Packet ID' field in the option
   in the packet sent to the originating host for packet with 'Packet
   Identifier' option MUST be the same as in received from this host
   packet. See Section 2.5 for details.

   The option is 'mandatory' for support.

2.4. Pseudo Header

   EUDP does not use pseudo header.

2.5. Packet Revival Acknowledgment Mechanism

   EUDP provides the possibility to request the acknowledgment of the
   single EUDP packet, This is provided by 'Packet Identifier' and
   'Packet Acknowledgment' options. In the simplest form, the
   acknowledgment mechanism works as below:

   Once EUDP host (let it be A) wants to request the acknowledgment of
   revival of some packet, it puts the 'Packet Identifier' option in it
   and sends this packet to another EUDP host (let it be B). Once B
   received the A's packet, it checks the 'Packet Identifier' option to
   find out the packet identifier. After it finds it out, this number
   becomes the 'ACK Packet Identifier', that is put into 'Packet
   Acknowledgment' option and sent to A. The Packet identifiers MAY be
   reused once they are acknowledged, since EUDP does not provide

   stateful connection.

   Compared with acknowledgment mechanism of TCP [RFC793], EUDP provides
   simpler and more liberal system. While TCP makes using the packet
   sequence numbers and acknowledgement mandatory, EUDP allows the host
   to decide whether the packet needs to be acknowledged by the other
   side or not. 

2.6. Compatibility with UDP

   The applications which use UDP can safely use EUDP with no options
   instead.

3.  Security Considerations

   Generic security issues for UDP concern EUDP as well.

   Additional security can be provided by additional options. This
   document does not define such options.

   UDP itself does not provide any authentication features. Such
   features can be provided by additional options, which are not defined
   by this document.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1. EUDP Options Numbers Registry

   IANA is asked to create and maintain the registry named 'EUDP Options
   Numbers Registry', which consists of 4 values: Option Kind, Option
   Length, Support Criteria, Description and Reference. They are
   described below.

     Option Kind value is integer; values from 0 to 255 are assigned.

     Option length may be omitted (for one octet options), be stated as
     an integer or 'variable'. 

     Support Criteria can be assigned as 'Mandatory' and 'Optional'. 

   The initial values are given below; assignments to this registry for
   'mandatory' options are to be made following the 'Standards Action'
   policies; for 'optional' options - following the 'RFC required'
   policies. [RFC5226]

   The Option Kind 0 is assigned for 'No Operation' option. No Option
   Length value is assigned for it. The Support Criteria for this option
   is 'mandatory'. The Reference document is this RFC xxxx.

   The Option Kind 1 is assigned for 'End Of Options Lis't option. No
   Option Length value is assigned for it. The Support Criteria for this
   option is 'mandatory'. The Reference document is this RFC xxxx.

   The Option Kind 2 is assigned for 'Echo Request' option. The Option
   Length value 'variable' is assigned for it. The Support Criteria for
   this option is 'mandatory'. The Reference document is this RFC xxxx.

   The Option Kind 3 is assigned for 'Echo Response' option. The Option
   Length value 'variable' is assigned for it. The Support Criteria for
   this option is 'mandatory'. The Reference document is this RFC xxxx.

   The Option Kind 4 is assigned for 'Packet Identifier' option. The
   Option Length value 4 is assigned for it. The Support Criteria for
   this option is 'mandatory'. The Reference document is this RFC xxxx.

   The Option Kind 5 is assigned for 'Packet Acknowledgement' option.
   The Option Length value 4 is assigned for it. The Support Criteria
   for this option is 'mandatory'. The Reference document is this RFC
   xxxx.

   The Option Kinds 6-253 are available for assignment.

   The Option Kind 254 is permanently reserved for experimentation
   purposes.

   The Option Kind 255 is permanently reserved for future use.

   [RFC Editor: Please replace xxxx with assigned RFC number]

4.2. EUDP Ports Registry

   As EUDP uses the same port set as UDP, IANA is asked to mark that all
   assigned UDP ports can be used with EUDP as well.

4.3. IP Protocol Number Assignment

   IANA has assigned the IP protocol number TBD1 to be used with EUDP.
