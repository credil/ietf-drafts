Abstract

   In some IPv6/IPv4 translation scenarios it is necessary for an IPv6
   host to know the IPv6 prefix used by its NAT64.  In some of the IPv6/
   IPv4 translation proposals, the prefix is not fixed; that is, the

   AFT:  Address Family Translator.  A device that translates between IP
   address families.

   DNS64:  The function of synthesizing an AAAA response from an A
   record.


2.  Introduction

   Several variations of Address Family Translators (AFT) have been
   proposed for IPv6/IPv6 coexistence.  For IPv6 hosts to access IPv4
   hosts, a DNS function exists which synthesizes DNS AAAA records --
   this function generally called "DNS64" (also "DNS rewriting")
   [I-D.bagnulo-behave-dns64].  The DNS64 function, when used in
   conjunction with an NAT64, allows a IPv6-only host to access IPv4-
   only hosts.  This access, for the most part, is transparent to the
   IPv6 host -- to much the same degree that today's widely-deployed
   NATs are transparent to IPv4 hosts.  But, like with today's NATs,
   there are applications which do not work with NAT64 or do not work
   with DNS64, and require IPv6 hosts to implement additional
   functionality.

   So far, two applications have been identified which can benefit from
   knowing the IPv6 prefix of the host's NAT64:

   o  host-based DNSSEC validation (as described in Section 4.3 of
      [I-D.bagnulo-behave-dns64])

   o  BitTorrent (Section 2.2 of [I-D.wing-behave-nat64-referrals])


3.  Learning IPv6 Prefix and Length

   Both the IPv6 prefix and the prefix length need to be learned This
   can be done using DNS or DHCP, as described in the following
   sections.

3.1.  Using DNS to Learn IPv6 Prefix and Length

   This specification defines a new U-NAPTR [RFC4848] application to
   discover the NAT64's IPv6 prefix and length.  The input domain name
   is the exact same as would be used for a reverse DNS lookup, derived

   from the host's IPv6 in the ".ip6.arpa." tree and follows the
   construction rules in Section 2.5 of [RFC3596].  This is shortened to
   20 labels (representing a /64 network prefix) and, if DNS returns an
   error is shortened to 16 labels (representing a /48 network prefix).

   If a NAT64 is present on the network, the successful result of one of
   those queries will produce a NAPTR record with the desired service
   tag "NAT64:" which contains the IPv6 prefix and prefix length o the
   NAT64, separated by a "/" (the same syntax as specified in Section
   2.3 of [RFC4291]).

   For example, a host with the IP address 2001:db8:1:2:3:4:567:89ab
   would first send an NAPTR query for
   3.0.0.0.2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA (20 elements,
   representing a /64 network prefix).  If that fails (returns
   NXDOMAIN), it would send an NAPTR query for
   2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.IP6.ARPA (16 elements, representing a
   /48 network prefix).

      Note:  Both /64 and /48 prefix lengths are shown in this version
      of the document for illustrative purposes.  The number of elements
      of this query will depend on the prefix length(s) defined by the
      BEHAVE working group for a NAT64.  If the BEHAVE working group
      decides that all NAT64's will have a certain prefix length, then
      only one DNS query is sent.

   If the host needs to authenticate the prefix it just learned (e.g.,
   because the host is running a DNSSEC validator) the host performs the
   additional authentication steps described in Section 4.

3.2.  Using DHCP to Learn IPv6 Prefix and Length

   A new DHCP option, OPTION_AFT_PREFIX, is defined.  It contains the
   IPv6 prefix and its length.

   In order to conserve space, it is RECOMMENDED that only the
   significant bits of the IPv6 prefix be sent in the DHCP option.

   If the host needs to authenticate the prefix it just learned (e.g.,
   because the host is running a DNSSEC validator) the host performs the
   additional authentication steps described in Section 4.


4.  Authenticating the Learned Prefix

   In some cases (e.g., a host performing DNSSEC validation), the host
   needs to authenticate the NAT64's IPv6 prefix learned via one of the
   mechanisms described earlier.  To allow such authentication the
   operator of the NAT64 first creates a PTR record for the NAT64 (with
   0's for the elements after the NAT64's IPv6 prefix) which points to a
   hostname.  The hostname has a signed AAAA record for the same
   0-padded IPv6 address returned by the PTR query.  Once those
   configuration steps are done, a host can validate the NAT64 IPv6
   prefix by performing the following steps:

Internet-Draft        Learning NAT64's IPv6 Prefix            March 2009


   a.  The host sends a DNS PTR query for the IPv6 address of the NAT64
       (for "ipv6.arpa"), using 0 for the elements after the prefix
       length.  This will return the fully-qualified hostname of that
       NAT64 device.

   b.  Verify the full-qualified hostname is on the host's configured
       list of authorized translators (e.g., seattle.nat64.example.net).

   c.  Send a DNS AAAA query for that hostname.

   d.  Verify the AAAA response matches the IPv6 address obtained in
       step 1.

   e.  Perform DNSSEC validation of the AAAA response.

   For example, if the NAT64's IPv6 prefix length is /48, the host would
   send a PTR query for 2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.2.3.4.IP6.ARPA which
   would return a hostname, seattle.nat64.example.net.  The host
   verifies that seattle.nat64.example.net is on its configured list of
   authorized NAT64 hosts, as maintained in a text file.  The host sends
   an AAAA query for seattle.nat64.example.net and verifies the AAAA
   response contains the same IPv6 address.  The host then validates the
   DNSSEC signature for seattle.nat64.example.net.


5.  Security Considerations

   After learning the IPv6 prefix of its translator by following the
   procedures in this specification, the IPv6 host will utilize this
   information for subsequent actions (e.g., sending a packet to it, or
   using that information to synthesize DNS records or to perform DNSSEC
   validation).  If an attacker provides a fraudulent IPv6 to the IPv6
   host, the attacker can become on-path for traffic to/from that IPv6
   host and preform passive or active eavesdropping or traffic analysis.
   To protect against this attack, it is RECOMMENDED that IPv6 hosts be
   configured with the names of authorized translators and RECOMMENDED
   that IPv6 hosts uses DNSSEC to validate that name matches the IPv6
   prefix learned via DNS or DHCPv6, as described in Section 4.


6.  IANA Considerations

   A new DHCPv6 option, OPTION_AFT_PREFIX, needs to be assigned by IANA.

   The new NAPTR Application Service tag "NAT64" is registered with
   IANA.

A.1.  multi-homed hosts

   A multi-homed host may have different NAT64 devices available on each
   of its networks, and can learn those via DNS or via DHCP.

   When using DNS to learn the NAT64 prefix (Section 3.1) or using DNS
   to authenticate the NAT64 prefix (Section 4, it is possible a split
   horizon DNS exists.  Such a split DNS requires the host to query the
   DNS server associated with that network prefix as described in
