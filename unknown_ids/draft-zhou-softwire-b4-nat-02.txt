          DS-Lite AFTR NAT Bypass: Co-located B4 and NAT Model
                     draft-zhou-softwire-b4-nat-02

Abstract

   This document describes the behavior of the B4 when co-located with a
   NAT while the NAT in the AFTR is disabled.  The proposed solution is
   expected to offload the burden on the AFTR, by delegating the NAT to
   B4.

Internet-Draft     B4 Behavior in NAT By-pass Solution         July 2011


1.  Introduction

   As currently defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], B4
   element SHOULD NOT operate a NAT function because the NAT function
   will be performed by the AFTR in the service provider's network.  To
   reduce the processing requirement of NAT device at the network side,
   address and port translation can be made at the customer side, e.g.,
   CPE.  For convenience, we call this solution as NAT-Bypass.

   This document provides descriptions on the B4 behavior when
   supporting NAT-Bypass.


2.  B4 Behavior

2.1.  Provisioning

   The provisioning of the B4 element is similar to what is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

2.2.  Plain IPv4 Address

   A B4 MAY be assigned with a plain IPv4 address.

   When a plain, IPv4 address is assigned, the NAT operations are
   enforced as per current legacy CPEs.  The NAT in the AFTR is disabled
   for that user.

   IPv4 datagrams are encapsulated in IPv6 as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

2.3.  Restricted IPv4 Address

   In the NAT-Bypass solution, the port set is provisioned to B4 through
   PCP option defined in [I-D.tsou-pcp-natcoord] or specific DHCP
   options [I-D.bajko-pripaddrassign].

   The PCP Server or IPv4 DHCP server may be co-located with the AFTR.

   The B4 is responsible for performing NAT and/ALG functions, as well
   as supporting NAT Traversal mechanisms (e.g., UPnP or NAT-PMP).

2.3.1.  Incoming Ports on a given restricted IPv4 address

   As described in [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues], a bulk
   of incoming ports can be reserved as a centralized resource shared by
   all subscribers using a given restricted IPv4 address.  In order to
   distribute incoming ports as fair as possible among subscribers

Internet-Draft     B4 Behavior in NAT By-pass Solution         July 2011


   sharing a given restricted IPv4 address, other than allocating a
   continuous range of ports to each, a solution to distribute bulks of
   non-continuous ports among subscribers, which also takes port
   randomization into account, is elaborated in Section 3.1.

2.3.2.  Outgoing Packets Processing

   Upon receiving an IPv4 packet, the B4 performs NAT using the public
   IPv4 address and port set assigned to it.  Then B4 encapsulates the
   resulting IPv4 packet into an IPv6 packet, and delivers it through
   IPv6 connectivity to AFTR which will then decapsulate the
   encapsulated packet and forward it through IPv4.  The destination
   IPv6 address used for encapsulation should be the AFTR's address.

2.3.3.  Incoming Packets Processing

   Upon receipt of IPv4-in-IPv6 packet from AFTR, B4 will decapsulate
   the packet and translate the public IPv4 address to the private IPv4
   address.  Finally, it delivers the packet to the host using the
   translated IPv4 address.  The source IPv6 address used for
   encapsulation at AFTR is the AFTR's address, and the destination
   address is set to the external address of B4.

2.4.  Stateless Encapsulation

   B4 may implement the stateless encapsulation specified in Section 4.4
   of [I-D.ymbk-aplusp].

2.5.  Fragmentation and Reassembly

   No change to Section 5.3 of [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

2.6.  DNS

   The DNS behavior is the same as described in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].


3.  Security Considerations

3.1.  Port Randomization and non-contiguous port sets allocation
      mechanism

   As port randomization is one protection among others against blind
   attacks, a simple non-contiguous port sets distribution mechanism is
   therefore proposed to distribute bulks of non-continuous ports among
   subscribers, and to enable subscribers operating port randomized NAT.

Internet-Draft     B4 Behavior in NAT By-pass Solution         July 2011


   On every external IPv4 address, according to port set size N, log2(N)
   bits are randomly choosing by AFTR as subscribers identification bit
   (s bit) among 1st and 16th bits.  Take a sharing ration 1:32 for
   example, Figure 1 shows an example of 5 random selected bits of s
   bit.

                 |1st |2nd |3rd |4th |5th |6th |7th | 8th|
                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
                 | 0  |  s | 0  | 0  | s  | 0  | s  |  0 |
                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
                 |9th |10th|11th|12th|13th|14th|15th|16th|
                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
                 | s  | 0  |  s | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

       Figure 1: A s bit selection example (on a sharing ration 1:32
                                 address).

   Subscriber ID pattern is formed by setting all the s bits to 1 and
   other trivial bits to 0.  Figure 2 illustrates an example of
   subscriber ID pattern on a sharing ration 1:32 address.  Note that
   the subscriber ID pattern will be different, guaranteed by the random
   s bit selection, on every restricted IP address no matter whether the
   sharing ratio varies.

                 |1st |2nd |3rd |4th |5th |6th |7th | 8th|
                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
                 | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1  |  0 |
                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
                 |9th |10th|11th|12th|13th|14th|15th|16th|
                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
                 | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

    Figure 2: A subscriber ID pattern example (on a sharing ration 1:32
                                 address).

   Subscribers ID value is then assigned by setting subscriber ID
   pattern bits (s bits shown in the following example) according to a
   customer value and setting other trivial bits to 1.

      Figure 3: A subscriber ID value example (0# subscriber on this
                           restricted address).

   Subscriber ID pattern and subscriber ID value together uniquely
   defines a non-overlapping port set on a restricted IP address.

   Pseudo-code shown in the Figure 4 describe how to use subscriber ID
   pattern and subscriber ID value to implement a random ephemeral port
   selection function in a restricted port set.

      do{
          restricted_next_ephemeral = (random()| customer_ID_pattern)
                                      & customer_ID_value;
          if(five-tuple is unique)
          return restricted_next_ephemeral;
      }
