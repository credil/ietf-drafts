1.  Introduction

   This memo specifies two new algorithms.  One is the usage of CMAC
   based on Camellia block cipher on the authentication mechanism of the
   IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [6] and Authentication
   Header protocols (AH) [5].  This algorithm is called
   Camellia-CMAC-96.  Latter is Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) based on
   CMAC with Camellia block cipher for Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2)
   [7].  This algorithm is called Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128.

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [3].

   This document specifies the usage of CMAC with Camellia Block cipher
   on the authentication mechanism of the IPsec Encapsulating Security
   Payload [6] and Authentication Header [5] protocols.  This new
   algorithm is named Camellia-CMAC-96.

   NIST CMAC specification document [1] describes a method to use the
   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as a Message Authentication Code
   (MAC) that has a 128-bit output length.  The 128-bit output is useful
   as a long-lived PRF.  This document also specifies a PRF based on
   CMAC with Camellia block cipher that supports fixed and variable key
   sizes for IKEv2 [7] Key Derivation Function (KDF) and authentication.
   This new algorithm is named Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128.  For further
   information on IKE, AH and ESP, refer to [7], [5], [6], and [4].

   This document does not cover implementation details of CMAC.  Those
   details can be found in [1].

3.  Camellia-CMAC

   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
   recently specified the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code
   (CMAC).  CMAC [1] is a keyed hash function that is based on a
   symmetric key block cipher, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard
   [9].  The CMAC algorithm provides a framework for inserting various
   block cipher algorithm.

   Camellia-CMAC uses the Camellia block cipher [3] as a building block
   in CMAC [1].  To generate a MAC, Camellia-CMAC(K, M, len) takes a
   secret key 'K', a message of variable length 'M', and the length of
   the message in octets 'len' as inputs and returns a fixed-bit string.

   In this specification, Camellia-CMAC is always used with 128-bit
   length key.

4.  Camellia-CMAC-96

   For IPsec message authentication on AH and ESP, Camellia-CMAC-96 MAY
   be used.  Camellia-CMAC-96 is a Camellia-CMAC with 96-bit truncated
   output in MSB-first order.  The output is a 96-bit MAC that will meet
   the default authenticator length as specified in [5].  The result of
   truncation is taken in MSB-first order.

   Figure 1 describes Camellia-CMAC-96 algorithm:

   In step 1, Camellia-CMAC is applied to the message M in length len
   with key K.

   In step 2, the output block T is truncated to 12 octets in MSB-first
   order, and Truncated T (TT) is returned.

5.  Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128

   The Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128 algorithm is identical to Camellia-CMAC
   except that the 128-bit key length restriction is removed.

   IKEv2 [7] uses PRFs for multiple purposes, most notably for
   generating keying material and authentication of the IKE_SA.

   When using Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128 as the PRF described in IKEv2,
   Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128 is considered to take variable key length in
   all places, and the number of bits of keying material generated when
   new keys are generated is 128 bits (i.e. preferred key length when
   generating keying material of SK_d, SK_pi, and SK_pr is 128 bits).

   When generating SKEYSEED the full of Ni and Nr are used as key for
   the PRF.

   In step 1, the 128-bit key, K, for Camellia-CMAC is derived as
   follows:

   o  If the key, VK, is exactly 128 bits, then we use it as-is.

   o  If it is longer or shorter than 128 bits, then we derive the key,
      K, by applying the Camellia-CMAC algorithm using the 128-bit all-
      zero string as the key and VK as the input message.  This step is
      described in step 1b.

   In step 2, we apply the Camellia-CMAC algorithm using K as the key
   and M as the input message.  The output of this algorithm is
   returned.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security provided by Camellia-CMAC-96 Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128 is
   built on the strong cryptographic algorithm Camellia and CMAC.  At
   the time of this writing, there are no known practical cryptographic
   attacks against Camellia or CMAC.

   However, as is true with any cryptographic algorithm, part of its
   strength lies in the secret key, K, and the correctness of the
   implementation in all of the participating systems.  If the secret
   key is compromised or inappropriately shared, it guarantees neither
   authentication nor integrity of message at all.  The secret key shall
   be generated in a way that meets the pseudo randomness requirement of
   RFC 4086 [8] and should be kept safe.  If and only if
   Camellia-CMAC-96 Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128 are used properly it provides
   the authentication and integrity that meet the best current practice
   of message authentication.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has allocated value <TBD1> for IKEv2 Transform Type 3
   (Integrity Algorithm) to the AUTH_CAMELLIA_CMAC_96 algorithm, and has
   allocated a value of <TBD2> for IKEv2 Transform Type 2 (Pseudo-Random
   Function) to the PRF_CAMELLIA128_CMAC algorithm.
