Internet-Draft     UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP      October 2008


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3323] defines a privacy mechanism for the SIP (Session Initiation
   Protocol)[RFC3261], based on techniques available at the time of its
   publication.  This mechanism relies on the use of a separate privacy
   service to remove privacy-sensitive information from SIP messages
   sent by a user agent before forwarding those messages to the final
   destination.  Since then, numerous SIP extensions have been proposed
   and standardized.  Some of those enable a user agent to withhold its
   user's identity and related information without the need for privacy
   services, which was not possible when RFC 3323 was defined.

   The purpose of this document is not to obsolete RFC 3323, but to
   enhance overall privacy mechanism in SIP by allowing user agent to
   take control of its privacy, rather than being completely dependent
   on external privacy service.

   The UA-driven privacy mechanism defined in this document will not
   eliminate the need for RFC 3323 usage defined in [RFC3325] which
   instructs privacy service to delete P-Asserted-Identity header.  In
   order to delete a P-Asserted-Identity header, a user agent needs to
   set Privacy:id even when the user agent is utilizing this
   specification.

   This document defines a best current practice in which a user agent
   controls all the privacy functions on its own utilizing SIP
   extensions such as GRUU (Globally Routable User Agent URIs)
   [I-D.ietf-sip-gruu] and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT)
   [I-D.ietf-behave-turn].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   privacy-sensitive information:
               The information that identifies a user who sends the SIP
               message, as well as the supplementary information that
               can be used to guess the user's identity.


3.  Concept of Privacy

   The concept of privacy in this document is the act of concealing
   identity of a user and supplementary information.  The protection of
   network privacy (e.g., topology hiding) is outside the scope of this

   document.

   Privacy-sensitive information includes display-name and URI (Uniform
   Resource Identifier) in a From header field that can reveal the
   user's name and affiliation (e.g., company name), and IP addresses or
   host names in a Contact header field, a Via header field, a Call-ID
   header field, or an SDP (Session Description Protocol) [RFC4566] body
   that might reveal the location of a user agent.


4.  Treatment of Privacy-Sensitive Information

   Some fields of SIP messages that potentially contain privacy-
   sensitive information do not interfere with establishing dialog and
   can be omitted without any side effects.  Other fields are essential
   for establishing dialog and need to have its value replaced to
   anonymized values in order to obscure privacy-sensitive information.
   Of the privacy-sensitive information listed in section 3, URIs, host
   names, and IP addresses in Contact, Via, and SDP must be functional
   (i.e., suitable for purpose) even when they are anonymized.

   With the use of GRUU [I-D.ietf-sip-gruu] and TURN
   [I-D.ietf-behave-turn], a user agent can obtain URIs and IP addresses
   for media and signaling that are functional yet anonymous, and do not
   identify either the user agent or the user.  Instructions on how to
   obtain a functional anonymous URI and IP address are given in Section
   4.1 and 4.2, respectively.

   Host names should be concealed because the user's identity may be
   guessed from them, but they are not always regarded as critical
   privacy-sensitive information.

   In addition, a user agent should be careful not to include any
   information that identifies the user in optional SIP header fields
   such as Subject and User-Agent.

4.1.  Obtaining a Functional Anonymous URI Using the GRUU Mechanism

   A user agent wanting to obtain a functional anonymous URI MUST
   support and utilize the GRUU mechanism unless it is able to obtain a
   functional anonymous URI through other means outside the scope of
   this document.  By sending a REGISTER request requesting GRUU, the
   user agent can obtain an anonymous URI, which can later be used for
   the Contact header field.

   The detailed process on how a user agent obtains a GRUU is described
   in [I-D.ietf-sip-gruu].

Internet-Draft     UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP      October 2008


   If the Registrar supports the GRUU and returns a REGISTER response,
   the user agent SHOULD search within the REGISTER response for a
   "temp-gruu" URI parameter, which provides the desired privacy
   property.  If the "temp-gruu" URI parameter and value is present
   within the REGISTER response, the user agent SHOULD use the value of
   the "temp-gruu" as an anonymous URI representing the user agent.
   This URI SHOULD be used for the Contact header in subsequent requests
   and responses.

   If there is no "temp-gruu" URI parameter in the 200 response to the
   REGISTER request, a user agent SHOULD NOT proceed with its
   anonymization process, unless something equivalent to "temp-gruu" is
   provided through some administrative means.

   It is RECOMMENDED that user agent consult the user before sending a
   request without a functional anonymous URI when privacy is requested
   from the user.

   Due to the nature of how GRUU works, the domain name is always
   revealed when GRUU is used.  If revealing the domain name in Contact
   header field is a concern, usage of a third-party GRUU server to
   obtain a temp-gruu that is irrelevant to users' domain SHOULD be
   considered.  Refer to the Security Considerations section for
   details.

4.2.  Obtaining a Functional Anonymous IP Address Using the TURN
      Mechanism

   A user agent that is not provided with a functional anonymous IP
   address through some administrative means, MUST obtain a relayed
   address if anonymity is desired (IP address of the media relay) for
   use in SDP and in Via header.  Such IP address is to be derived from
   a STUN relay server through TURN mechanism, which allows a STUN
   server to act as a media relay.

   Anonymous IP addresses are needed for two purposes.  The first is for
   use in the Via header field of a SIP request.  By obtaining an IP
   address from a STUN relay server, using that address in the Via
   header field of the SIP request, and sending the SIP request to the
   STUN relay server, the IP address of the user agent will not be
   revealed beyond the relay server.

   The second is for use in SDP as an address for receiving media.  By
   obtaining an IP address from a STUN relay server and using that
   address in SDP, media will be received via the relay server.  Also
   media can be sent via the relay server.  In this way, neither SDP nor
   media packets reveal the IP address of the user agent.

Internet-Draft     UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP      October 2008


   It is assumed that a user agent is either manually or automatically
   configured through means such as the configuration framework
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework] with the address of one or more
   STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) [I-D.ietf-behave-turn]
   relay servers to obtain anonymous IP address.


5.  User Agent Behavior

   This section describes how to generate an anonymous SIP message at a
   user agent.

   A user agent fully compliant with this document MUST obscure or
   conceal all the critical UA-inserted privacy-sensitive information in
   SIP requests and responses as shown in Section 5.1 when user privacy
   is requested.  In addition, the user agent SHOULD conceal the non-
   critical privacy-sensitive information as shown in Section 5.2.

   Furthermore, when a user agent uses relay server to conceal its
   identity, the user agent MUST send requests to the relay server to
   ensure request and response bypass the same signaling path.

5.1.  Critical Privacy-Sensitive Information

5.1.1.  Contact Header Field

   Without privacy considerations, this field contains a URI used to
   reach the user agent for mid-dialog requests and possibly out-of-
   dialog requests, such as REFER [RFC3515].  The Contact header field
   can also contain a display-name.  Since the Contact header field is
   used for routing further requests to the user agent, it must include
   a functional URI even when it is anonymized.

   A user agent generating an anonymous SIP message supporting this
   specification MUST anonymize a Contact header using an anonymous URI
   ("temp-gruu") obtained through the GRUU mechanism or an anonymous URI
   containing an IP address obtained through the TURN mechanism, unless
   an equivalent functional anonymous URI is provided by some other
   means.

   Refer to Section 4.1 for details on how to obtain an anonymous URI
   through GRUU, and refer to Section 4.2 for details on how to obtain
   an IP address through TURN.

   A display-name in a Contact header MUST be omitted or "Anonymous".

Internet-Draft     UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP      October 2008


5.1.2.  From Header Field

   Without privacy considerations, this field contains the identity of
   the user, such as display-name and URI.

   RFCs 3261 and 3323 recommend to set "sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid"
   as a SIP URI in a From header field when user privacy is requested.
   This raises an issue when the SIP-Identity mechanism [RFC4474] is
   applied to the message, because SIP-Identity requires an actual
   domain name in the From header field.

   A user agent generating an anonymous SIP message supporting this
   specification MUST anonymize the From header field in one of the two
   ways described below.

   Option 1:

   A user agent anonymizes a From header field using an anonymous
   display-name and an anonymous URI following the procedure noted in
   section 4.1.1.3 of RFC 3323.

   The example form of the From header of option 1 is as follows:

      From: "Anonymous" <sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid>;tag=1928301774

   Option 2:

   A user agent anonymizes a From header field using an anonymous
   display-name and an anonymous URI with user's valid domain name
   instead of "anonymous.invalid".

   The example form of the From header of option 2 is as follows:

      From: "Anonymous" <sip:anonymous@atlanta.com>;tag=1928301774

   A user agent SHOULD go with option 1 to conceal its domain name in
   From header field.  However, the SIP-Identity will fail with the From
   header of option 1 because the SIP-Identity mechanism uses
   authentication based on the domain name.

   If a user agent is aware that SIP-Identity mechanism will be applied
   to the request, it is RECOMMENDED to go with option 2.  However, the
   user's domain name will be revealed from the From header field of
   option 2.

   If user wants both anonymity and strong identity, use a third party
   anonymization service which issues AoR for the use in From address
   which also provides SIP-Identity.

5.1.3.  Via Header Field

   Without privacy considerations, the bottommost Via header field added
   by a user agent contains the IP address and port or hostname that are
   used to reach the user agent for responses.

   A user agent generating an anonymous SIP request supporting this
   specification MUST anonymize the IP address in the Via header field
   using an anonymous IP address obtained through the TURN mechanism,
   unless an equivalent functional anonymous IP address is provided by
   some other means.

   Refer to Section 4.2 for details on how to obtain an IP address
   through TURN.

   Via header SHOULD NOT include a host name.

5.1.4.  IP Addresses in SDP

   A user agent generating an anonymous SIP message supporting this
   specification MUST anonymize IP addresses in SDP, if present, using
   an anonymous IP address obtained through the TURN mechanism, unless
   an equivalent functional anonymous IP address is provided by some
   other means.

   Refer to Section 4.2 for details on how to obtain an IP address
   through TURN.

5.2.  Non-Critical Privacy-Sensitive Information

5.2.1.  Host Names in Other SIP Header Fields

   A user agent generating an anonymous SIP message supporting this
   specification SHOULD conceal host names in any SIP header fields,
   such as Call-ID and Warning header fields, if considered privacy-
   sensitive.

5.2.2.  Optional SIP Header Fields

   Other optional SIP header fields (such as Call-Info, In-Reply-To,
   Organization, Referred-By, Reply-To, Server, Subject, User-Agent, and
   Warning) can contain privacy-sensitive information.

   A user agent generating an anonymous SIP message supporting this
   specification SHOULD NOT include any information that identifies the
   user in such optional header fields.

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification uses GRUU and TURN and inherits any security
   considerations described in these drafts.

   Furthermore, if the provider of the caller intending to obscure its
   identity consists of a small number of people (e.g. small enterprise,
   SOHO), the domain name alone can reveal the identity of the caller
   when this specification is used.

   Same can be true when the provider is large, but the receiver of the
   call only knows few people from the source of call.

   There are mainly two places in the message, From header and Contact
   header, where domain name must be functional.

   The domain name in From header can be obscured as described in
   section 5.1.2, on contrary the Contact header needs to contain a
   valid domain name at all time to function properly.

   It is probably important to note that generally a device will not
   show the contact address to the receiver, but this does not mean that
   one can not find the domain name in a message.  In fact as long as
   this specification is used to obscure identity, the message will
   always contain a valid domain name as it inherits key characteristics
   of GRUU.

   If one wants to assure anonymization, it is recommended for the user
   to seek and rely on third party anonymization service.

   A third party anonymization service provides registrar and TURN
   service which has no affiliation with the caller's provider, allowing
   caller to completely withhold its identity.

   This document requires no action by IANA.
