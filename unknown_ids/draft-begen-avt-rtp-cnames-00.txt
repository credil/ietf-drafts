 Guidelines for Choosing an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Name
              (CNAME) for Hosts with Private IP Addresses
                     draft-begen-avt-rtp-cnames-00

Abstract

   The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Name (CNAME) is a
   persistent transport-level identifier for an RTP endpoint.  While the
   Synchronisation Source (SSRC) identifier of an RTP endpoint may
   change if a collision is detected, or when the RTP application is
   restarted, the CNAME is meant to stay unchanged, so that RTP
   endpoints can be uniquely identified and associated with their RTP
   media streams.  For proper functionality, CNAMEs should be unique
   within the participants of an RTP session.  The recommendations for
   choice of the RTCP CNAME provided in RFC 3550 are insufficient to
   achieve uniqueness in some environments, particularly private IP
   networks.  This memo updates the guidelines in RFC 3550 to allow
   endpoints to choose unique CNAMEs in these environments.

Internet-Draft            Choice of RTCP CNAME                April 2010


1.  Introduction

   In Section 6.5.1 of [RFC3550], there are a number of recommendations
   for choosing the RTCP CNAME for an RTP endpoint.  These recommend
   that the CNAME is of the form "user@host" for multiuser systems, or
   "host" if the username is not available.  The "host" part is
   specified to be the fully qualified domain name of the host from
   which the real-time data originates, or the numeric representation of
   the IP address of the interface from which the RTP data originates
   for hosts that do not have a domain name.

   As noted in [RFC3550], the use of private network address space
   (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8) can result in hosts having network addresses that
   are not globally unique, and can lead to non-unique CNAMEs if hosts
   with private addresses and no direct IP connectivity to the public
   Internet have their RTP packets forwarded to the public Internet
   through an RTP-level translator.  [RFC3550] suggests that such
   applications provide a configuration option to allow the user to
   choose a unique CNAME, and puts the burden on the translator to
   translate CNAMEs from private addresses to public addresses if
   necessary to keep private addresses from being exposed.  Experience
   has shown that this does not work in practice, therefore this memo
   proposes an alternate algorithm for CNAME choice in private networks.


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Choice of RTCP CNAME in Private Networks

   In private IP networks, using the numeric representation of the
   private IP address as the RTCP CNAME is NOT RECOMMENDED, since it
   results in RTCP CNAMEs that are not globally unique.

   A host that does not know its fully qualified domain name, and is
   configured with a private IP address on the interface it is using for
   RTP communication, SHOULD use the numeric representation of the
   layer-2 (MAC) address of the interface it is using for RTP
   communication as the "host" part of its CNAME.  For IEEE 802 MAC
   addresses, such as Ethernet, the standard colon-separated hexadecimal
   format is to be used, e.g., "00:23:32:af:9b:aa".

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC3550] apply to this document as
   well.


5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations in this document.
