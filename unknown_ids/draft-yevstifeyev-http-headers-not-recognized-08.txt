INTERNET DRAFT      Headers Not Recognized for HTTP    December 12, 2010


1. Introduction

1.1. Motivation

   HTTP is one of the most widely-used protocols in the Internet. One of
   the things which made it so popular is extensibility. One can easily
   add any header to the HTTP message. However, servers are not able to
   support all the HTTP headers. Generally, if a server does not
   recognize the header, it simply ignores it. The client is not
   notified about not processed headers.

   This document proposes mechanism which allows servers to notify
   clients about not processes or not recognized headers.

   The proposal is to send a response with definite header field to the
   client if one or more headers of request were not processed. This
   document defines 'Headers-Not-Recognized' header field to be used in
   such occasion.

1.2. Conventions

   HTTP refers to protocol, defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616]

1.2.1. Conformance Criteria

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.2. Syntax Notation

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234].

   The construction <n>#<m>element is used as defined in RFC 2616
   [RFC2616], Section 2.1.

1.2.3. Terminology

   The terms user agent, client, server, proxy, and origin server have
   the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.1 specification ([RFC2616], Section
   1.3).

2. Technical Overview

2.1 Model of Work

   If a server receives request with unknown (for it) headers, it is
   RECOMMENDED that it sends a response with 'Headers-Not-Recognized'
   headers field. Information about what headers were not recognized
   MUST be put into this header. If a client receives such a response,
   it is RECOMMENDED that it avoids sending requests with headers
   mentioned in the 'Headers-Not-Recognized' header field or tries to
   change them so that the server recognize them.

   'Headers-Not-Recognized' is a response HTTP header.

2.2 Syntax

   'Headers-Not-Recognized' header field has the following format:

   headers_not_recognized = 1#header_name
   header_name            = token        ;name of not recognized header
   token                  = <as defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616]>

3. IANA Considerations

   The permanent message header field registry should be updated with
   the following registration:

   Header field name: Headers-Not-Recognized

   Applicable protocol: http

   Status: experimental

   Specification document: RFC xxxx

   [RFC Editor: replace xxxx with assigned RFC number]

   Note: This registration should take place at
         http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/perm-
         headers.html
         This note MUST be deleted upon publication.

4. Security Considerations

   This extension to HTTP is not believed to add any additional security
   concerns not already present in RFC 2616 [RFC2616].
