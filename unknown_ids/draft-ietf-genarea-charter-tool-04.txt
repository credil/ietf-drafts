             Requirements for a Working Group Charter Tool
                   draft-ietf-genarea-charter-tool-04

Abstract

   The IETF intends to provide a new tool to Area Directors for the
   creation, re-chartering, and closing of Working Groups.  The tool
   will also allow the IETF community to view the status of the
   chartering process.  This document describes the requirements for the
   proposed new tool, and it is intended as input to a later activity
   for the design and development of such a tool.

Internet-Draft            WG Charter Tool Reqs              January 2011


1.  Introduction

   [RFC2418] describes the guidelines and procedures for formation and
   operation of IETF Working Groups (WGs).  Since its publication in
   1998, the IETF has started many dozen new WGs, has shut down many
   dozen, and every WG that has had some (often dozens) of changes to
   its charter.

   Currently, virtually all of the tasks associated with creating,
   rechartering, and closing a WG are performed manually.  An Area
   Director (AD) requests one of these actions by manually sending a
   message to the Secretariat's ticket system.  A member of the
   Secretariat staff manually updates the internal Secretariat database
   and the IETF Datatracker, manually places the WG on the IESG
   teleconference agenda (when appropriate), and manually sends out all
   of the required messages and announcements.

   The IAOC would like to create a better tool for those tasks, and this
   document lists the requirements for such a tool.  When complete, this
   document may be used to issue an RFP for the design and development
   of the tool.  This document was prepared at the request of the IAOC.

1.1.  WG Charter Process Overview

   As described in [RFC2418], a key responsibility of the IESG is the
   creation, re-chartering, and closing of WGs.  Creation and
   rechartering of WGs is a multi-step process that involves internal
   review of a draft charter by the IESG and IAB, an external review of
   the draft charter by the IETF community, and (likely) approval of a
   final charter by the IESG.  The internal review by the IESG and IAB,
   and the external review by the IETF community, often result in
   revisions to the draft charter.

   Closing of a WG does not require review or approval by the IESG.
   Rather, a WG may be closed at the request of an AD, normally the Area
   Advisor for the WG.

1.2.  Discussion of These Requirements

   This document is being discussed on the charter-tool@ietf.org mailing
   list.  See <https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/charter-tool> for
   more information.


2.  General Requirements

   The tool described here holds records for new WGs that are being
   considered as well as for all WGs whose charter are under review.

Internet-Draft            WG Charter Tool Reqs              January 2011


2.1.  WG Records

   A WG record contains the following fields:

   o  name of the WG

   o  WG's acronym

   o  names of WG chairs

   o  shepherding AD

   o  IETF area

   o  charter text

   o  mailing list address and archive location

   o  previous mailing list (if any)

   In addition, a WG record contains the state of the WG in the review
   process.  That state has one annotation: whether or not the state is
   for a proposed WG or for an existing WG undergoing rechartering.
   Some changes in state cause messages to be sent to the Secretariat so
   that the Secretariat can perform additional steps, such as sending
   out mail to various parties about the current state.

   Any AD can modify fields in an existing WG record.  Any AD can use
   the tool to change the review state of a WG record.  The normal order
   for steps is shown in this document.

2.2.  Comments

   During the reviews for WG creation and rechartering, ADs can comment
   on the reviews.  Any AD can add a comment to the record of a WG that
   is under review.  Each comment can be flagged as private, meaning
   that it is only to be viewed by the IESG and IETF Secretariat.  Also,
   each comment can be flagged as either "discuss" (meaning blocking
   forward movement until it is resolved) and "regular" (meaning that it
   is non-blocking but informative).

2.3.  Naming of Charter Text Proposals

   Charter text proposals are to be kept for historical purposes.  They
   are kept in files with a specific naming pattern.  The pattern for
   charters before a WG is formed is wgacronym-proposal-nn, where
   "wgacronym" is the acronym of the proposed WG, and "nn" is a two-
   digit number assigned in sequence, starting at 00.



Hoffman                   Expires July 17, 2011                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            WG Charter Tool Reqs              January 2011


   When a WG is chartered, that charter gets the name whose pattern is
   wgacronym-charter-nn, with the first charter having sequence number
   00.  When a WG exists and is being rechartered, the pattern is
   wgacronym-recharter-ss-nn, where "ss" is the sequence number of the
   current charter.  For example, the first time a WG is rechartered,
   the pattern would be wgacronym-recharter-00-nn.

2.4.  Wording of Announcements

   An AD can view and edit the standard "WG Review" and "WG Action"
   announcements before they are sent out during the WG creation,
   rechartering, and closing processes.  If the AD edits the message,
   the Secretariat is alerted to that fact when they receive the
   request.

2.5.  Access to the Tool

   Area Directors and the IETF Secretariat currently have access to
   performing some actions in the Datatracker that other community
   members cannot; this access control continues to be used in many of
   the extensions listed in this document.  Further, the IETF
   Secretariat and the IETF Chair can perform all actions that can be
   performed by any AD in this tool.

2.6.  Showing Some Information Only to ADs and the Secretariat

   Some information, such as private comments, will be viewable only by
   ADs and the IESG Secretariat.  Some information might be private for
   some charters but public for others; for example, some ADs have made
   their choices for potential WG chairs public in some BoF charters.

2.7.  Initializing the Tool

   Records for all WGs that are being created, or are in the process of
   charter updates, will be added before the tool is first publicly
   deployed.

   The database should also be initialized with historical data, namely
   as much information as is currently known about closed WGs.


3.  Creating and Rechartering WGs

3.1.  Chartering a New WG

   Any AD can create a new WG record using a simple web form.  Creating
   a record should succeed as long as there is no other WG with the same
   name.  The form comes with defaults of the AD who is filling in the



Hoffman                   Expires July 17, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            WG Charter Tool Reqs              January 2011


   form as the shepherding AD, that AD's area as the proposed area.  The
   AD can fill in all the fields for the propose WG.

   Creating a new WG record causes the Datatracker state for this
   potential new WG to be "Informal IESG review".  When the record is
   created, the AD proposes a length of time (in weeks) for the internal
   review time; the default is one week.

   The review states in which a WG can exist during its initial
   chartering are:

   o  Informal IESG review -- This is the initial state, moved into by
      the tool when an AD creates a WG record.  When the WG record is
      moved to this state, a message is sent to the Secretariat.  The
      normal next state is "Initial IESG and IAB review" if the idea is
      accepted, or "Not currently under review" if the idea is
      abandoned.  The tool should prompt the AD if they try to move to
      the next state in less than the minimum elapsed time is set by the
      AD when creating the WG.

   o  Initial IESG and IAB review -- The IESG and IAB are reviewing the
      early draft of the charter.  When moved to this state, a note is
      sent to the Secretariat to place this on the next IESG telechat
      and to inform the IAB.  The usual next state is "External review"
      if the idea is adopted, or "Informal IESG review" if the IESG
      decides the idea needs more work, or "Not currently under review"
      if the idea is abandoned.

   o  External review -- The IETF community and possibly other SDOs are
      reviewing the proposed charter.  When moved to this state, a note
      is sent to the Secretariat to send out the external review
      announcement to the appropriate lists.  The usual next state is
      "IESG review", although it might move to "Not currently under
      review" if the idea is abandoned during the external review.

   o  IESG review -- The IESG is reviewing the discussion from the
      external review of the proposed charter.  When moved to this
      state, a note is sent to the Secretariat to schedule discussion
      for the next IESG telechat.  The usual next state is "WG exists",
      or "Not currently under review" if the idea is abandoned.

   o  WG exists -- The WG was approved by the IESG.  When moved to this
      state, a note is sent to the Secretariat to publish the charter
      and send the appropriate announcements.  The WG remains in this
      state until there is a request to update the charter.

   o  Not currently under review -- The proposed WG is not being
      considered at this time.  A proposed WG charter will remain in

Internet-Draft            WG Charter Tool Reqs              January 2011


      this state until an AD moves it to "Informan IESG review".

   All states above, except for "WG exists", are given the annotation
   "Initial chartering".

3.2.  Rechartering an Existing WG

   Any AD can request that a WG be rechartered using a simple web form.
   This form prompts with the current charter and allows all fields to
   be edited.  Asking for a recharter causes the Datatracker state for
   this WG to be "Informal IESG review".  When the recharter record is
   created, the AD proposes a length of time (in weeks) for the internal
   review time; the default is one week.

   The review states in which a WG can exist during rechartering are:

   o  Informal IESG review -- This is the initial state, moved into by
      the tool when an AD asks for a WG to be rechartered.  When the WG
      record is moved to this state, a message is sent to the
      Secretariat.  The normal next state is "Initial IESG and IAB
      review" if the idea is accepted, or "WG exists" if this attempt to
      recharter is abandoned.  The tool should prompt the AD if they try
      to move to the next state in less than the minimum elapsed time is
      set by the AD when asking to recharter the WG.

   o  Initial IESG and IAB review -- The IESG and IAB are reviewing the
      proposed new charter.  When moved to this state, a note is sent to
      the Secretariat to place this on the next IESG telechat and to
      inform the IAB.  The usual next state is "External review" if the
      idea is adopted, or "Informal IESG review" if the IESG decides the
      idea needs more work, or "WG exists" if the current rechartering
      abandoned.

   o  External review -- The IETF community and possibly other SDOs are
      reviewing the proposed new charter.  When moved to this state, a
      note is sent to the Secretariat to send out the external review
      announcement to the appropriate lists.  The usual next state is
      "IESG review", although it might move to "WG exists" if the
      current rechartering is abandoned during the external review.

   o  IESG review -- The IESG is reviewing the discussion from the
      external review of the recharter.  When moved to this state, a
      note is sent to the Secretariat to schedule discussion for the
      next IESG telechat.  The usual next state is "WG exists", or "Not
      currently under review" if the idea is abandoned.

   o  WG exists -- There is no active rechartering effort for this WG.

Internet-Draft            WG Charter Tool Reqs              January 2011


   All states above, except for "WG exists", are given the annotation
   "Rechartering".

3.3.  Ballots for Charter Approval

   The current Datatracker has facilities for ballots on adoption of
   Internet Drafts to become RFCs.  Those facilities need to be expanded
   to allow balloting for initial chartering or rechartering during IESG
   review.


4.  Requesting the Closing of a WG

   An AD can use the tool to request the Secretariat to close an
   existing WG.  The request action will prompt the AD to provide
   instructions regarding the disposition of any active Internet-Drafts
   (withdraw them or convert them to individual submissions), wording
   for the closure announcement, and the status of the WG mailing list
   (will it remain open or should it be closed).


5.  Searching and Comparing Charters

5.1.  Viewing and Searching the Charter Database

   All members of the IETF community can view the public portions of the
   charter database.  They can also search for a WG record in the tool
   based on one or more of the following criteria:

   o  WG name (full or partial)

   o  WG acronym

   o  WG charter state

   o  Shepherding AD

   o  Area

   o  Text in any of the fields

   Further, all users can view all snapshots of earlier versions of a
   WG's charter.  Snapshots include the Area, AD, WG name, WG acronym,
   chairs, and charter text

Internet-Draft            WG Charter Tool Reqs              January 2011


5.2.  Seeing Differences between Versions of Pre-approval Wordings

   It needs to be easy to compare differences between different versions
   of proposed charter language, up to and including the approved
   version.  Using the naming formats given in Section 2, this means
   that it must be easy to compare wgacronym-charter-ss (for the highest
   value of "ss") with wgacronym-recharter-ss-nn.  It must also be
   possible to compare any two versions of approved charters (that is,
   of two values for "ss" in wgacronym-charter-ss).


6.  IANA Considerations

   None.


7.  Security Considerations

   Creating a new tool for tracking the charter of WGs does not affect
   the security of the Internet in any significant fashion.


8.  Acknowledgements

   This document draws heavily on, including wholesale copying from,
   earlier work done on this topic by other writers.  They will be
   acknowledged by name in a future version of this document if their
   identities are ascertained.

   Various members of the IESG contributed many suggestions to this
   document.  In particular David Harrington, Robert Sparks, and Russ
   Housley contributed a great deal of wording and many ideas.


9.  Normative References

   [RFC2418]  Bradner, S., "IETF Working Group Guidelines and
              Procedures", BCP 25, RFC 2418, September 1998.


Appendix A.  Some Known Open Issues

   There are actually many more open issues than are listed here.  This
   list is mostly meant to remind the author of topics that need to be
   updated in future versions of the document, and to spur readers to
   think of even more open issues.

   o  It is not yet clear whether the tool will have its own database or
      use the current Datatracker database.

   o  There needs to be a requirement about Atom feeds for the charters.


Appendix B.  Differences between -03 and -04

   This is a total reorganization of the document.  Instead of being a
   jumble of requirements, it is now organized by action.  This causes
   some duplication across actions (notably between WG creation and
   rechartering), but there are some subtle differences that makes this
   duplication worthwhile.

   Aligned the actions and states to the "Working Group Procedures"
   document used by the IESG and IETF Secretariat.  This caused many of
   the states to change names.

   Added a balloting procedure.

   Added a charter numbering scheme.

   Removed the "Requirement" part of the section headings because they
   were not really requirements.

   Removed "milestones" everywhere because it is part of the charter
   text.
