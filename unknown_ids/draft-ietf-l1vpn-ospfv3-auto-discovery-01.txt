Abstract

   This document defines an Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) version 3
   based Layer-1 Virtual Private Network (L1VPN) auto-discovery
   mechanism.  This document parallels the existing OSPF version 2 L1VPN
   auto-discovery mechanism.  The notable functional difference is the
   support of IPv6.

1.2. Overview

   The framework for Layer 1 VPNs is described in [RFC4847].  Basic mode
   operation is further defined in [RFC5251].  [RFC5251] identifies the
   information that is necessary to map customer information (port
   identifiers) to provider information (identifiers).  It also states
   that this mapping information may be provided via provisioning or via
   an auto-discovery mechanism.  [RFC5252] provides such an auto-
   discovery mechanism using Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) version 2.
   This document provides the same functionality using of OSPF version 3
   and adds support for IPv6.

   Figure 1 shows the L1VPN basic service being supported using OSPF
   based L1VPN auto-discovery.  This figure shows two PE routers
   interconnected over a GMPLS backbone.  Each PE is attached to three
   CE devices belonging to three different Layer 1 VPNs.  In this
   network, OSPF is used to provide the VPN membership, port mapping and
   related information required to support basic mode operation.

                 Figure 1: OSPF Auto-Discovery for L1VPNs

   The approach used in this document to provide OSPFv3 based L1VPN
   auto-discovery uses a new type of Link State Advertisement (LSA)
   which is referred to as an OSPFv3 L1VPN LSA.  The OSPFv3 L1VPN LSA
   carries information in TLV (type, length, value) structures.  An
   L1VPN specific TLV is defined below to propagate VPN membership and
   port information.  This TLV is is referred to as the L1VPN Info TLV.

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-l1vpn-ospfv3-auto-discovery-01.txt June 25, 2008


   The OSPFv3 L1VPN LSA may also carry Traffic Engineering (TE) TLVs,
   see [RFC3630], [RFC4203], and [OSPFv3-TE].

   L1VPN TLV Type
      The type of the TLV (see above).

      TLV Length
      The length of the TLV in bytes, excluding the four (4) bytes
      of the TLV header and, if present, the length of the Padding
      field.

   L1VPN Globally Unique Identifier
      As defined in [RFC5251].

   PE TE Address
      This field MUST carry an address that has been advertised by
      the LSA originator per [OSPFv3-TE] and is either the Router
      Address TLV or Local interface IP address link sub-TLV.  It will
      typically carry the TE Router Address.

   Link Local Identifier
      This field is used to support unnumbered links.  When an
      unnumbered PE TE link is represented, this field MUST contain
      a value advertised by the LSA originator per [RFC2740] in a
      Router LSA.  When a numbered link is represented, this field
      MUST be set to zero (0).

   L1VPN Auto-discovery information
      As defined in [RFC5251].




Berger                        Experimental                      [Page 7]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-l1vpn-ospfv3-auto-discovery-01.txt June 25, 2008


   Padding
      A field of variable length and of sufficient size to ensure
      that the TLV is aligned on a four (4) byte boundary.  This
      field is only required when the L1VPN Auto-discovery
      information field is not four (4) byte aligned.  This field
      MUST be less than four (4) bytes long, and MUST NOT be present
      when the size of L1VPN Auto-discovery information field is
      four (4) byte aligned.


3. OSPFv3 L1VPN LSA Advertising and Processing

   PEs advertise local <CPI, PPI> tuples in OSPFv3 L1VPN LSAs containing
   L1VPN Info TLVs. Each PE MUST originate a separate OSPFv3 L1VPN LSA
   with AS flooding scope for each local CE-PE link. The LSA MUST be
   originated each time a PE restarts and every time there is a change
   in the PIT entry associated with a local CE-PE link. The LSA MUST
   include a single L1VPN Info TLV and MAY include a single TE Link TLV.
   The TE Link TLV carries TE attributes of the associated CE-PE link.
   Note that because CEs are outside of the provider TE domain, the
   attributes of CE-PE links are not advertised via normal OSPF-TE
   procedures as described in [OSPFv3-TE]. If more than one L1VPN Info
   TLVs and/or TE Link TLVs are found in the LSA, the subsequent TLVs
   SHOULD be ignored by the receiving PEs.

   Every time a PE receives a new, removed, or modified OSPFv3 L1VPN
   LSA, the PE MUST check whether it maintains a PIT associated with the
   L1VPN specified in the L1VPN Globally unique identifier field.  If
   this is the case (the appropriate PIT will be found if one or more
   local CE-PE links that belong to the L1VPN are configured), the PE
   SHOULD add, remove or modify the PIT entry associated with each of
   the advertised CE-PE links accordingly. (An implementation MAY choose
   to not remove or modify the PIT according to local policy or
   management directives.)  Thus, in the normal steady-state case, all
   PEs associated with a particular L1VPN will have identical local PITs
   for an L1VPN.


4. Backward Compatibility

   Neither the TLV nor the LSA introduced in this document present any
   interoperability issues. Per [RFC2740] and due to the U-bit being
   set, OSPFv3 speakers that do not support the OSPFv3 L1VPN LSA (Ps for
   example) just participate in the LSAs flooding process but should
   ignore the LSAs contents.

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-l1vpn-ospfv3-auto-discovery-01.txt June 25, 2008


5. Security Considerations

   The approach presented in this document describes how PEs dynamically
   learn L1VPN specific information. Mechanisms to deliver the VPN
   membership information to CEs are explicitly out of scope of this
   document. Therefore, the security issues raised in this document are
   limited to within the OSPF domain.

   This defined approach reuses mechanisms defined in [RFC2740].
   Therefore the same security approaches and considerations apply to
   this approach.  OSPF provides several security mechanisms that can be
   applied.  Specifically, OSPF supports multiple types of
   authentication, limits the frequency of LSA origination and
   acceptance, and provides techniques to avoid and limit impact
   database overflow.  In cases were end-to-end authentication is
   desired, OSPF's neighbor-to-neighbor authentication approach can be
   augmented with an approach similar to the experimental extension to
   OSPF, see [RFC2154], which supports the signing and authentication of
   LSAs.


6. IANA Considerations

   Section 2.1 of this document requests the assignment of an OSPFv3 LSA
   Function Code, see http://www.iana.org/assignments/ospfv3-parameters.
   IANA is requested to make an assignment in the form:

       Value   OSPFv3 LSA type function Type            Reference
      -------  -----------------------------            ---------
          TBA  OSPFv3 L1VPN LSA                         [this document]

      A value of 13 is suggested for TBA.
