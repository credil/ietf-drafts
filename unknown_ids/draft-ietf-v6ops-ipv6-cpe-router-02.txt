Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE router requirements          October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document defines IPv6 features for a residential or small office
   router referred to as an IPv6 CE router.  Typically these routers
   also support IPv4.

   This document specifies how an IPv6 CE router automatically
   provisions its WAN interface, acquires an address block for
   provisioning of its LAN interfaces and fetches other configuration
   information from the service provider network.  Automatic
   provisioning of more complex topology than a single router with
   multiple LAN interfaces is out of scope for this document.

   See [RFC4779] for a discussion of options available for deploying
   IPv6 in service provider access networks.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   End-user Network      one or more links attached to the IPv6 CE
                         router that connect IPv6 hosts.

   IPv6 Customer Edge router  a node intended for home or small office
                         use which forwards IPv6 packets not explicitly
                         addressed to itself.  The IPv6 CE router
                         connects the end-user network to a service
                         provider network.

   IPv6 host             any device implementing an IPv6 stack receiving
                         IPv6 Internet connectivity through the IPv6 CE
                         router

   LAN interface         an IPv6 CE router's attachment to a link in the
                         end-user network.  Examples are Ethernets
                         (simple or bridged), 802.11 wireless or other
                         LAN technologies.  An IPv6 CE router may have
                         one or more LAN Interfaces.

   Service Provider      a company that offers its customers access to
                         the Internet.  In this document, a Service
                         Provider specifically offers Internet access
                         using IPv6, and may also offer IPv4 Internet

                         access.  The Service Provider can provide such
                         access over a variety of different transport
                         methods such as DSL, cable, wireless, and
                         others.

   WAN interface         an IPv6 CE router's attachment to a link used
                         to provide connectivity to the Service Provider
                         network; example link technologies include
                         Ethernets (simple or bridged), PPP links, X.25,
                         Frame Relay, or ATM networks as well as
                         Internet-layer (or higher-layer) "tunnels",
                         such as tunnels over IPv4 or IPv6 itself.


3.  Architecture

3.1.  Current IPv4 end-user network architecture

   An end-user network will likely have to support both IPv4 and IPv6.
   It is not expected that an end-user will change their existing
   network topology with the introduction of IPv6.  There are some
   differences in how IPv6 works and is provisioned which has
   implications for the network architecture.  A typical IPv4 end-user
   network consist of a "plug and play" NAT box connected to the ISP.
   The assumption is a single NAT device with a single link behind it.
   The NAT provides stable addressing allowing for manually configured
   addresses on the nodes in the end-user network.

   A typical IPv4 NAT deployment by default blocks all incoming
   connections.  Opening of ports is typically allowed using UPnP or
   some other firewall control protocol.

   Another consequence of using private address space in the end-user
   network is that it provides stable addressing, i.e. it never changes
   even when you change ISPs, and the addresses are always there even
   when the WAN interface is down or the customer edge router has not
   yet been provisioned.

   Rewriting addresses on the edge of the network also allows for some
   rudimentary multi-homing; even though using NATs for multi-homing
   does not preserve connections during fail-overs [RFC4864].

   Many existing routers support dynamic routing, and advanced end users
   can build arbitrary, complex networks using manual configuration of
   address prefixes combined with a dynamic routing protocol.

3.2.  IPv6 end-user network architecture

   The end-user network architecture for IPv6 should provide equivalent
   or better capabilities and functionality than the equivalent IPv4
   architecture.

   The end-user network is a stub network.  Figure 1 illustrates the
   model topology for the end-user network.

                 An example of a typical end-user network.

   This architecture describes the:

   o  Basic capabilities of an IPv6 CE router

   o  Provisioning of the WAN interface connecting to the ISP

   o  Provisioning of the LAN interfaces

   The IPv6 CE router defaults to acting as the demarcation point
   between two networks by providing a ULA boundary, a multicast zone
   boundary and ingress and egress traffic filters.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE router requirements          October 2009


   For IPv6 multicast traffic the IPv6 CE router may act as an MLD proxy
   [RFC4605] and may support a dynamic multicast routing protocol.

   IPv6 CE router may be manually configured in an arbitrary topology
   with a dynamic routing protocol.  Automatic provisioning and
   configuration is described for a single IPv6 CE router only.


4.  Use Cases and Requirements

4.1.  WAN side configuration

   The IPv6 CE router will need to support connectivity to one or more
   access network architectures.  This document describes an IPv6 CE
   router that is not specific to any particular architecture or Service
   Provider, and supports all commonly used architectures.

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and DHCP protocols operate over any type of
   IPv6 supported link-layer and there is no need for a link-layer
   specific configuration protocol for IPv6 network layer configuration
   options like what's e.g. in PPP IPCP for IPv4.  This section makes
   the assumption that the same mechanism will work for any link-layer,
   be it Ethernet, DOCSIS, PPP/PPPoE or others.

   When the router is attached to the WAN interface link it must act as
   an IPv6 host for the purposes of IPv6 interface initialisation, ND
   Router Discovery, Prefix Discovery and interface address assignment
   ([RFC4861]/[RFC4862]).  The router acts as a requesting router for
   the purposes of DHCP prefix delegation ([RFC3633]).

   DHCP address assignment (IA_NA) and DHCP prefix delegation (IA_PD)
   should be done as a single DHCP session.

   Link-layer requirements:

   WLL-1:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support IPv6 over Ethernet [RFC2464].

   WLL-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support IPv6 over PPP [RFC5072].  It
           MUST support use of IPv6 over PPP within PPPoE.

   Address assignment requirements:

   WAA-1:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support SLAAC ([RFC4862]).

   WAA-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST follow the recommendation in
           [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-subnet-model] and in particular the
           handling of the L-bit in the Router Advertisement Prefix
           Information Option.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE router requirements          October 2009


   WAA-3:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support DHCP [RFC3315] client
           behavior.  It MUST be able to support the following DHCP
           options: IA_NA, Reconfigure Accept([RFC3315]), DNS_SERVERS
           ([RFC3646]).

   WAA-4:  Th IPv6 CE router SHOULD support the DHCP SNTP option
           ([RFC4075]) and the Information Refresh Time Option
           ([RFC4242].

   WAA-5:  If the IPv6 CE router receives an RA message (described in
           [RFC4861]) with the M-bit set to 1, the IPv6 CE router MUST
           request an IA_NA.  If the IPv6 CE router is unable to assign
           an address through SLAAC it MAY request an IA_NA even if the
           M-bit is set to 0.

   WAA-6:  If the IPv6 CE router does not acquire a global IPv6 address
           from either SLAAC or DHCP, then it MUST create a global IPv6
           address from its delegated prefix and configure that on one
           of its internal virtual network interfaces.

   Prefix Delegation requirements:

   WPD-1:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support DHCP prefix delegation
           requesting router behaviour as specified in [RFC3633] (IA_PD
           option).  The IPv6 CE router MUST ask for a prefix large
           enough to cover all of its LAN interfaces.

   WPD-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST always initiate DHCP prefix
           delegation, regardless of the M and O-bits in a received
           Router Advertisement.  If the IPv6 CE Router initiates DHCP
           before receiving a Router Advertisement it MUST also request
           an IA_NA.

   WPD-3:  If the delegated prefix is an aggregate route of multiple,
           more-specific routes the IPv6 CE router MUST discard packets
           that match the aggregate route, but not any of the more-
           specific routes.  In other words, the "next-hop" for the
           aggregate route should be the null destination.  This is
           necessary to prevent forwarding loops when some addresses
           covered by the aggregate are not reachable.  [RFC4632]

   WPD-4:  If the IPv6 CE router requests both an IA_NA and an IA_PD in
           DHCP, it MUST accept an IA_PD in DHCP Advertise/Reply
           messages, even if the message does not contain any addresses
           (IA_NA options with status code NoAddrsAvail).

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE router requirements          October 2009


   WPD-5:  An IPv6 CE router MUST not by default initiate any dynamic
           routing protocol on its WAN interface.

4.2.  LAN side configuration

   The IPv6 CE router distributes configuration information obtained
   during WAN interface provisioning to IPv6 hosts and assists IPv6
   hosts in obtaining IPv6 addresses.  It also supports connectivity of
   these devices in the absence of any working WAN interface.

   An IPv6 CE router will be expected to support an IPv6 end-user
   network and IPv6 hosts that exhibit the following characteristics:

   1.  Link-local addresses are insufficient for allowing IPv6
       applications to communicate with each other in the end-user
       network.  The IPv6 CE router will need to enable this
       communication by providing globally-scoped unicast addresses or
       ULAs whether or not WAN connectivity exists.

   2.  IPv6 hosts will be capable of using SLAAC and may be capable of
       using DHCP for acquiring their addresses.

   3.  IPv6 hosts will use DHCP for other configuration information,
       such as the DNS_SERVERS option for acquiring DNS information.

   Unless otherwise specified these requirements only apply to the IPv6
   CE router's LAN interfaces.

   Requirements:

   L-1:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support ULA addressing ([RFC4193]).

   L-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST have a ULA prefix that it maintains
         consistently across reboots.  The value of the ULA prefix
         SHOULD be user configurable.

   L-3:  The IPv6 CE router by default MUST act as a site border router
         according to section 4.3 of RFC4193 and filter packets with
         Local IPv6 source or destination addresses accordingly.

   L-4:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support router behavior of Neighbor
         Discovery for IPv6 ([RFC4861]).

   L-5:  The IPv6 CE router must assign a separate /64 from its
         delegated prefix (and ULA prefix if configured to provide ULA
         addressing) for each of its LAN interfaces.  The IPV6 CE router
         MUST make the interface an advertising interface according to
         RFC4861.  In router advertisements messages, the Prefix

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE router requirements          October 2009


         Information Option's A/L-bits MUST be set to 1 by default; the
         A/L bits setting SHOULD be user configurable.

   L-6:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support a DHCP server ([RFC3315]) on
         its LAN interfaces.  It SHOULD support DHCP address assignment
         (IA_NA).

   L-7:  Unless the IPv6 CE router is configured to support DHCP IA_NA,
         it SHOULD set M=0 and O=1 in its RA messages.

   L-8:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support providing DNS information in
         the DHCP DNS_SERVERS option ([RFC3646]).

   L-9:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD pass the additional set of DHCP
         options received from the DHCP client on its WAN interface from
         the Service Provider to IPv6 hosts.

4.3.  General requirements

   The IPv6 CE router is responsible for implementing IPv6 routing; that
   is, the IPv6 CE router must look up the IPv6 Destination address in
   its routing table to decide to which interface it should send the
   packet.

   In this role, the IPv6 CE router is responsible for ensuring that
   traffic using its ULA addressing does not go out the WAN interface,
   and does not originate from the WAN interface.

   Requirements:

   G-1:  An IPv6 CE router is an IPv6 node and MUST follow the IPv6 Node
         Requirements [RFC4294] specification.

   G-2:  The IPV6 CE router SHOULD support the following RFCs:

         *  Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification [RFC2460]

         *  Stateless Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Service
            for IPv6 [RFC3736]

         *  Default Router Preferences and More-Specific Routes
            [RFC4191]

         *  IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291]

         *  IPv6 Subnet Model: the Relationship between Links and Subnet
            Prefixes [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-subnet-model]

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE router requirements          October 2009


   G-3:  The IPv6 CE router MUST NOT forward any IPv6 traffic between
         its LAN Interface(s) and its WAN Interface until the router has
         successfully completed the IPv6 address acquisition process.

4.4.  Security Considerations

   It is considered a best practice to filter obviously malicious
   traffic (e.g. spoofed packets, "martian" addresses, etc.).  Thus, the
   IPv6 CE router should support basic stateless egress and ingress
   filters.  The CE router should also offer mechanisms to filter
   traffic entering the customer network; however, the method by which
   vendors implement configurable packet filtering is beyond the scope
   of this document.

   Security requirements:

   S-1:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD support
         [I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-simple-security].

   S-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support ingress filtering in accordance
         with [RFC2827](BCP 38)
