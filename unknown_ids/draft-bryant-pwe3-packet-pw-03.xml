    <section title="Introduction ">
      <t>There is a need to provide a method of carrying a packet service over
      an MPLS PSN in a way that provides isolation between the two networks.
      The server MPLS network may be an MPLS network or a network conforming
      to the MPLS-TP <xref target="RFC5317"></xref>. The client may also be
      either a MPLS network of a network conforming to the MPLS-TP.
      Considerations regarding the use of an MPLS network as a server for an
      MPLS-TP network are outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>Where the client equipment is connected to the server equipment via
      physical interface, the same data-link type MUST be used to attach the
      clients to the Provider Edge equipments (PE)s, and a pseudowire (PW) of
      the same type as the data-link MUST be used <xref
      target="RFC3985"></xref>. The reason that inter-working between
      different physical and data-link attachment types is specifically
      disallowed in the pseudowire architecture is because this is a complex
      task and not a simple bit-mapping exercise. The inter-working is not
      limited to the physical and data-link interfaces and the state-machines.
      It also requires a compatible approach to the formation of the
      adjacencies between attached client network equipment. As an example the
      reader should consider the differences between router adjacency
      formation on a point to point link compared to a multi-point to
      multi-point interface (e.g. Ethernet).</t>

      <t>A further consideration is that two adjacent MPLS LSRs do not simply
      exchange MPLS packets. They exchange IP packets for adjacency formation,
      control, routing, label exchange, management and monitoring purposes. In
      addition they may exchange data-link packets as part of routing (e.g.
      IS-IS hellos and IS-IS LSPs) and for OAM purposes such as Link Layer
      Discovery protocol [IEEE standard 802.1AB-2009]. Thus the two clients
      require an attachment mechanism that can be used to multiplex a number
      of protocols. In addition it is essential to the correct operation of
      the network layer that all of these protocols fate share.</t>

      <t>Where the client LSR and server PE is co-located in the same
      equipment, the data-link layer can be simplified to a simple protocol
      identifier (PID) that is used to multiplex the various data-link types
      onto a pseudowire. This is the method that described in this
      document.</t>

      <t>The network reference model for the packet pseudowire operating in an
      MPLS network is shown in <xref target="PKT-PW-NR"></xref>. This is an
      extension of Figure 3 "Pre-processing within the PWE3 Network Reference
      Model" from <xref target="RFC3985"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In this model LSRs, LSR1 and LSR2, are part of the client MPLS packet
      switched network (PSN). The PEs, PE1 and PE2 are part of the server PSN,
      that is to be used to provide connectivity between the client LSRs. The
      attachment circuit that is used to connect the MPLS LSRs to the PEs is a
      virtual interface within the equipment. A packet pseudowire is used to
      provide connectivity between these virtual interfaces. This packet
      pseudowire is used to transport all of the required layer 2 and layer 3
      between protocols between LSR1 and LSR2.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Client Network Layer Model">
      <t>The packet PW appears as a single point to point link to the client
      layer. Network Layer adjacency formation and maintenance between the
      client equipments will the follow normal practice needed to support the
      required relationship in the client layer. The assignment of metrics for
      this point to point link is a matter for the client layer. In a hop by
      hop routing network the metrics would normally be assigned by
      appropriate configuration of the embedded client network layer equipment
      (e.g. the embedded client LSR). Where the client was using the packet PW
      as part of a traffic engineered path, it is up to the operator of the
      client network to ensure that the server layer operator provides the
      necessary service level agreement.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Forwarding Model">
      <t>The packet PW forwarding model is illustrated in <xref
      target="fwd-model"></xref>. The forwarding operation can be likened to a
      virtual private network (VPN), in which a forwarding decision is first
      taken at the client layer, an encapsulation is applied and then a second
      forwarding decision is taken at the server layer.</t>

      <t>A packet PW PE comprises three components, the client LSR, PW
      processor and a server LSR. Note that <xref target="RFC3985"></xref>
      does not formally indicate the presence of the server LSR because it
      does not concern itself with the server layer. However it is useful in
      this document to recognise that the server LSR exists.</t>

      <t>It may be useful to first recall the operation of a layer two PW such
      as an Ethernet PW <xref target="RFC4448"></xref> within this model. The
      client LSR is not present and packets arrive directly on the attachment
      circuit (AC) which is part of the client network. The PW undertakes any
      header processing, if configured to do so, it then pushes the PW control
      word (CW), and finally pushes the PW label. The PW function then passes
      the packet to the LSR function which pushes the label needed to reach
      the egress PE and forwards the packet to the next hop in the server
      network. At the egress PE, the packet typically arrives with the PW
      label at top of stack, the packet is thus directed to the correct PW
      instance. The PW instance performs any required reconstruction using, if
      necessary, the CW and the packet is sent directly to the attachment
      circuit.</t>

      <t>Now let us consider the case client layer MPLS traffic being carried
      over a packet PW. An LSR belonging to the client layer is embedded
      within the PE equipment. This is a type of native service processing
      element <xref target="RFC3985"></xref>. This LSR determines the next hop
      in the client layer, and pushes the label needed by the next hop in the
      client layer. It then passes the packet to the correct PW instance
      indicating the packet protocol type. If the PW is configured to require
      a CW this is pushed. The PW instance then examines the protocol type and
      pushes a label that identifies the protocol type to the egress PE. The
      PW instance then proceeds as it would for a layer two PW, by pushing the
      PW label and then handing the packet to the server layer LSR for
      delivery. At egress, the packet again arrives with the PW label at the
      top of stack which causes the packet to be passed to the correct PW
      instance. This PW instance knows that the PW type is a packet PW, and
      hence that it needs to interpret the next label as a protocol type
      identifier. If necessary the CW is then popped and processed. The packet
      is then passed to the egress client LSR together with information that
      identifies the packet protocol type. The egress client LSR then forwards
      the packet in the normal manner for a protocol of that type.</t>

      <t>Note that although the description above is written in terms of the
      behaviour of an MPLS LSR, the processing model would be similar for an
      IP packet, or indeed any other protocol type.</t>

      <t>Note that the semantics of the PW between the client LSRs is a point
      to point link.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Design Considerations">
      <t>A number of approaches to the design of a packet pseudowire (PW) have
      been investigated and have been described at the IETF. This section
      discusses the approaches that were analysed and the technical issues
      that the authors took into consideration in arriving at the proposed
      approach.</t>

      <t>In a typical network there are usually no more that four network
      layer protocols that need to be supported: IPv4, IPv6, MPLS and CLNS
      although any solution needs to be scalable to a larger number of
      protocols. The approaches considered in this document all satisfy this
      minimum requirement, but vary in their ability to support larger numbers
      of network layer protocols.</t>

      <t>Additionally it is beneficial if the complete set of protocols
      carried over the network between in support of a set of CE peers fate
      share. It is additionally beneficial if a single OAM session can be used
      to monitor the behaviour of this complete set. During the investigation
      various views were expressed as to where on the scale from absolutely
      required to "nice to have" these benefits lay, but in the end they were
      not a factor in reaching our conclusion.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Encapsulation Approaches Considered">
      <t>There are four candidate approaches that have been analysed:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>A protocol identifier (PID) in the PW Control Word (CW)</t>

          <t>A PID label</t>

          <t>Parallel PWs - one per protocol.</t>

          <t>Virtual Ethernet</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="A Protocol Identifier in the Control Word">
        <t>This is the approach that we proposed in draft 0 of this document .
        The proposal was that a Protocol Identifier (PID) would included in
        the PW control word (CW), by appending it to the generic control word
        <xref target="RFC5385"></xref> to make a 6 byte CW (the version 0
        draft actually included two reserved bytes to provide 32bit alignment,
        but let us assume that was optimized out). A variant of this is just
        to use a 2 byte PID without a control word.</t>

        <t>This is a simple approach, and is basically a virtual PPP interface
        without the PPP control protocol. This has a smaller MTU than for
        example a virtual Ethernet would need, however in forwarding terms it
        is not as simple as the PID label or multiple PW approaches described
        next, and may not be deployable on a number of existing hardware
        platforms.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="PID Label ">
        <t>This is the approach that we described in Version 2 of this
        document. The in this mechanism the PID is indicated by including a
        label after the PW label that indicates the protocol type as shown in
        <xref target="PEn"></xref>. </t>

        <t anchor="PIDLEncap"></t>

        <t>In the PID Label approach a new Label Distribution protocol (LDP)
        Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) element is used to signal the
        mapping between protocol type and the PID label. This approach
        complies with RFC3031 and is the approach described in Section 3.4.3
        of <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-framework"></xref> . </t>

        <t>The authors surveyed the hardware designs produced by a number of
        companies across the industry and concluded that whilst the approach
        complies with the MPLS architecture, it may conflict with a number of
        designer's interpretation of the existing MPLS architecture. This led
        to concerns that the approach may result in unexpected difficulties in
        the future. Specifically there is an assumption in many designs that a
        forwarding decision should be made on the basis of a single label.
        Whilst the approach is attractive, it cannot be supported by many
        commodity chip sets and this would require new hardware which would
        increase the cost of deployment and delay the introduction of a packet
        PW service.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Parallel PWs">
        <t>In this approach one PW is constructed for each protocol type that
        must be carried between the PEs. Thus a complete packet PW would
        therefore consist of a bundle of PWs . This model would be very simple
        and efficient from a forwarding point of view. The number of parallel
        PWs required would normally be relatively small. In a typical network
        there are usually no more that four network layer protocols that need
        to be supported: IPv4, IPv6, MPLS and CLNS although any solution needs
        to be scalable to a larger number of protocols.</t>

        <t>The are a number of serious downsides with this approach:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>From an operational point of view the lack of fate sharing
            between the protocol types can lead to complex faults which are
            difficult to diagnose. </t>

            <t>There is an undesirable trade off in the OAM related to the
            first point. Either we would have to run an OAM on each PW and
            bind them together which lead to significant protocol and software
            complexity and does not scale well. Alternatively we would need to
            run a single OAM session on one of the PWs as a proxy for the
            others and the diagnose any more complex failure on a case by case
            basis. To some extent the issue of fate sharing between protocol
            in the bundle (for example the assumed fate sharing between CLNS
            and IP in IS-IS) can be mitigated through the use of BFD.</t>

            <t>The need to configure manage and synchronize the behaviour of a
            group of PWs as if they were a single PW leads to an increase in
            control plane complexity.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The Parallel PW mechanism is therefore an approach which simplifies
        the forwarding plane, but only at a cost of a considerable increase in
        other aspects of the design and in particular operation of the PW.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Virtual Ethernet">
        <t>Using a virtual Ethernet to provide a packet PW would require PEs
        to include a virtual (internal) Ethernet interface and then to use an
        Ethernet PW <xref target="RFC4448"></xref> to carry the user traffic.
        This is conceptually simple and can be implemented today without any
        further standards action, although there are a number of applicability
        considerations that it is useful to draw to the attention of the
        community. </t>

        <t>Conceptually this is a simple approach and some deployed equipments
        can already do this. However the requirement to run a complete
        Ethernet adjacency lead us to conclude that there was a need to
        identify a simpler approach. The packets encapsulated in an Ethernet
        header have a larger MTU than the other approaches, although this is
        not considered to be an issue on the networks needing to carry packet
        PWs. </t>

        <t>The virtual Ethernet mechanism was the first approach that the
        authors considered, before the merits of the other approaches appeared
        to make them more attractive. As we shall see below however, the other
        approaches were not without issues and it appears that the virtual
        Ethernet is preferred approach to providing a packet PW.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Recommended Encapsulation">
        <t>The operational complexity and the breaking of fate sharing
        assumptions associated with the parallel PW approach would suggest
        that this is not an approach that should be further pursued.</t>

        <t>The PID Label approach gives rise to the concerns that it will
        break implicit behavioural and label stack size assumptions in many
        implementations. Whilst those assumptions may be addressed with new
        hardware this would delay the introduction of the technology to the
        point where it was unlikely to gain acceptance in competition with an
        approach that needed no new protocol design and is already supportable
        on many existing hardware platforms.</t>

        <t>The PID in the CW leads to the most compact protocol stack, is
        simple and requires minimal protocol work. However it is a new
        forwarding design, and apart from the issue of the larger packet
        header and the simpler adjacency formation offers no advantage over
        the virtual Ethernet.</t>

        <t>The above considerations bring us back to the virtual Ethernet,
        which is a well known protocol stack, with a well known (internal)
        client interface. It is already implemented in many hardware platforms
        and is therefore readily deployable. The authors conclude that having
        considered a number of initially promising alternatives, the
        simplicity and existing hardware make the virtual Ethernet approach to
        the packet PW the most attractive solution. </t>

      <t>This conforms to the PW protocols stack as defined in <xref
      target="RFC4448"></xref> and</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-fat-pw"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This is unremarkable except to note that the stack does not retain 32
      bit alignment between the virtual Ethernet header and the PW optional
      control word (or the PW label when the optional components are not
      present in the PW header). This loss of 32 bit of alignment is necessary
      to preserve backwards compatibility with the Ethernet PW design <xref
      target="RFC4448"></xref></t>

      address the virtual Ethernet will be discussed in a future version of

    <section title="Ethernet Functional Restrictions">
      <t>The use of Ethernet as the encapsulation mechanism for traffic
      between the server LSRs is a convenience based on the widespread
      availability of existing hardware. In this application there is no
      requirement for any Ethernet feature other than its protocol
      multiplexing capability. Thus, for example, the Ethernet OAM is NOT
      REQUIRED.</t>

      <t>The use and applicability of Ethernet VLANs, 802.1p, and 802.1Q
      between PEs will be discussed in a future revision.</t>

    <section title="Congestion Considerations ">
      <t>A packet pseudowire is normally used to carry IP, MPLS and their
      associated support protocols over an MPLS network. There are no
      congestion considerations beyond those that ordinarily apply to an IP or
      MPLS network. Where the packet protocol being carried is not IP or MPLS
      and the traffic volumes are greater than that ordinarily associated with
      the support protocols in an IP or MPLS network, the congestion
      considerations being developed for PWs apply <xref
