1. Introduction 

   Service providers (SPs) have been leveraging IP multicast to provide 
   revenue-generating services, such as IP television (IPTV), video 
   conferencing, as well as the distribution of stock quotes or news. 
 
 
Bonda, et al.           Expires July 17, 2011                 [Page 2] 

Internet-Draft      IP Multicast PM Requirements          January 2011 
    

   These services are usually loss-sensitive or delay-sensitive, and 
   their data packets need to be delivered over a large scale IP network 
   in real-time.  Meanwhile, these services demand relatively strict 
   service-level agreements (SLAs). For example, loss rate over 5% is 
   generally considered unacceptable for IPTV delivery. Video 
   conferencing normally demands delays no more than 150 milliseconds. 
   However, the real-time nature of the traffic and the deployment scale 
   of service make it very challenging for IP multicast performance 
   monitoring in a SP's production network. With increasing deployment 
   of multicast service in SP networks, it becomes mandatory to develop 
   an efficient system that is designed for SPs to accommodate the 
   following functions. 

   o SLA monitoring and verification: verify whether the performance of 
      a production multicast network meets SLA requirements. 

   o Network optimization: identify bottlenecks when the performance 
      metrics do not meet the SLA requirements. 

   o Fault localization: pin-point impaired components in case of 
      performance degradation and service disruption. 

   These functions alleviate the OAM cost of IP multicast network for 
   SPs, and ensure the quality of services. 

   However, the existing IP multicast monitoring tools and systems, 
   which were mostly designed either for primitive connectivity 
   diagnosis or for experimental evaluations, do not suit an SP 
   production network, given the following facts: 

   o Most of them provide end-to-end reachability check only [2][4][6]. 
      They cannot provide sophisticated measurement metrics such as 
      packet loss, one-way delay, and jitter, for the purpose of SLA 
      verification. 

   o Most of them can perform end-to-end measurements only. For example, 
      RTCP-based monitoring system [5] can report end-to-end packet loss 
      rate and jitter. End-to-end measurements are usually inadequate 
      for fault localization, which needs finer grain measurement data 
      to pin-point exact root causes. 

   o Most of them use probing packets to probe network performance [2] 
      [4]. The approach might yield biased or even irrelevant results 
      because the probing results are sampled and the out-of-band 
      probing packets might be forwarded differently from the monitored 
      user traffic.

Internet-Draft      IP Multicast PM Requirements          January 2011 
    

   o Most of them are not scalable in a large deployment like an SPs' 
      production network. For example, in IPTV deployment, the number of 
      group members might be in the order of thousands.  In this scale, 
      an RTCP-based multicast monitoring system [5] becomes almost 
      unusable because RTCP report intervals of each receiver might be 
      delayed up to minutes or even hours because of over-crowded 
      reporting multicast channel [12]. 

   o Some of them rely on the information from external protocols, 
      which make their capabilities and deployment scenarios limited by 
      the external protocols. The examples are passive measurement tools 
      that collect and analyze messages from protocols such as multicast 
      routing protocols [7], IGMP [9], or RTCP [5], etc.  Another 
      example is a SNMP-based system [8] that collects and analyzes 
      relevant multicast MIB information. 

   This document describes the requirement for an IP multicast 
   performance monitoring system for service provider (SP) IP multicast 
   networks. This system should enable efficient monitoring of 
   performance metrics of any given multicast channel (*,G) or (S,G) and 
   provides diagnostic information in case of performance degradation or 
   failure, which help SPs to do SLA verification, network optimization, 
   and fault localizations in a large production network. 

2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 

3. Terminologies 

   o SSM (source specific multicast): When a multicast group is 
      operating in SSM mode, only one designated node is eligible to 
      send traffic through the multicast channel. An SSM multicast group 
      with the designated source address s and group address G is 
      denoted by (s, G). 

   o ASM (any source multicast): When a multicast group is operating in 
      ASM mode, any node can multicast packets through the multicast 
      channel to other group members. An ASM multicast group with group 
      address G is denoted by (*, G). 

   o Root (of a multicast group): In an SSM multicast group (s, G), the 
      root of this group is the first-hop router next to the source node 
      s. In an ASM multicast group (*, G), the root of this group is the 
      selected rendezvous point router.

Internet-Draft      IP Multicast PM Requirements          January 2011 
    

   o Receiver: The term receiver refers to any node in the multicast 
      group that should receive multicast traffic. 

   o Internal forwarding path: Given a multicast group and a forwarding 
      node in the group, the internal forwarding path inside the node 
      refers to the data path between the upstream interface towards the 
      root and one of the downstream interfaces toward a receiver. 

   o Multicast forwarding path: Given a multicast group, a multicast 
      forwarding path refers to the sequence of the interfaces, links 
      and internal forwarding paths from the downstream interface at the 
      root until the upstream interface at a receiver. 

   o Multicast forwarding tree: Given a multicast group G, the union of 
      all multicast forwarding paths composes the multicast forwarding 
      tree. 

   o Segment (of multicast forwarding path): The segment of a multicast 
      forwarding path refers to part of the path between any two given 
      interfaces. 

   o Measurement session: A measurement session refers to the period of 
      time in which certain performance metrics over a segment of 
      multicast forwarding path is monitored and measured. 

   o Monitoring node: A monitoring node is a node on a multicast 
      forwarding path that is capable of performing traffic performance 
      measurements on its interfaces. 

   o Active interface: An interface of a monitoring node that is turned 
      on to start a measurement session is said to be active. 

   o Measurement session control packets: The packets are used for 
      dynamic configuration for active interface to coordinate 
      measurement sessions. 

   Figure 1 shows a multicast forwarding tree rooted at a root's 
   interface A. Within router 1, B-C and B-D are two internal forwarding 
   paths. Path A-B-C-E-G-I is a multicast forwarding path, which starts 
   at root's downstream interface A and ends at receiver 2's upstream 
   interface I. A-B, B-C-E are two segments of this forwarding path. 
   When a measurement session for a metric such as loss rate is turned 
   on over segment A-B, interfaces A and B are active interfaces.

4. Functional Requirements 

4.1. Topology discovery and monitoring 

   The monitor system SHOULD have mechanisms to collect topology 
   information of the multicast forwarding trees for any given multicast 
   group. The function can be an integrated part of this monitoring 
   system. Alternatively, the function might rely on other tools and 
   protocols, such as mtrace [3], MANTRA[7], etc. The topology 
   information will be referenced by network operators to decide where 
   to enable measurement sessions. 

4.2. Performance measurement 

   The performance metrics that a monitoring node needs to collect 
   include, but are not limit to, the following. 

4.2.1. Loss rate 

   Loss rate over a segment is the ratio of user packets not delivered 
   to the total number of user packets delivered over this segment 
   during a given interval. The number of user packets not delivered 
   over a segment is the difference between the number of packets 
   transmitted at the starting interface of the segment and received at 
   the ending interface of this segment. Loss rate is crucial for 
   multimedia streaming, such as IPTV, video/audio conferencing. 

   Loss rate over any segment of a multicast forwarding path MUST be 
   provided. The measurement interval MUST be configurable.

Internet-Draft      IP Multicast PM Requirements          January 2011 
    

4.2.2. One-way delay 

   One-way delay over a segment is the average time that user packets 
   take to traverse this segment of forwarding path during a given 
   interval. The time that a user packet traversing a segment is the 
   difference between the time when the user packet leaves the starting 
   interface of this segment and the time when the same user packet 
   arrives at the ending interface of this segment. The one-way delay 
   metric is essential for real-time interactive applications, such as 
   video/audio conferencing, multiplayer gaming. 

   One-way delay over any segment of a multicast forwarding path SHOULD 
   be able to be measured. The measurement interval MUST be configurable. 

   To get accurate one-way delay measurement results, the two end 
   monitoring nodes of the investigated segments might need to have 
   clock synchronized. 

4.2.3. Jitter 

   Jitter over a segment is the variance of one-way delay over this 
   segment during a given interval. The metric is of great importance 
   for real-time streaming and interactive applications, such as IPTV, 
   audio/video conferencing. 

   One-way delay jitter over any segment of a multicast forwarding path 
   SHOULD be able to be measured. The measurement interval MUST be 
   configurable. 

   Same as One-way delay measurement, to get accurate jitter, the clock 
   frequencies at the two end monitoring nodes might need to be 
   synchronized so that the clocks at two systems will proceed at the 
   same pace. 

4.2.4. Throughput 

   Throughput of multicast traffic for a group over a segment is the 
   average number of bytes of user packets of this multicast group 
   transmitted over this segment in unit time during a given interval. 
   The information might be useful for resource management. 

   Throughput of multicast traffic over any segment of a multicast 
   forwarding path MAY be measured. The measurement interval MUST be 
   configurable.

Internet-Draft      IP Multicast PM Requirements          January 2011 
    

4.3. Measurement session management 

   A measurement session refers to the period of time in which 
   measurement for certain performance metrics is enabled over a segment 
   of multicast forwarding path or over a complete multicast forwarding 
   path. During a measurement session, the two end interfaces are said 
   active. When an interface is activated, the interfaces start 
   collecting statistics, such as number or timestamps of user packets 
   which belongs to the given multicast group and pass through the 
   interface. When both interfaces are activated, the measurement 
   session starts. During a measurement session, data from two active 
   interfaces are periodically correlated and the performance metrics, 
   such as loss rate or delay, are derived. The correlation can be done 
   either on the downstream interface if the upstream interface passes 
   its data to it or on a third-party if the raw data on two active 
   interfaces are reported to it. When one of the two interfaces is 
   deactivated, the measurement session stops. 

4.3.1. Segment v.s. Path 

   Network operators SHOULD be able to turn on or off measurements 
   sessions for specific performance metrics over either a segment of 
   multicast forwarding path or over a complete multicast forwarding 
   path at any time. For example in Figure 1, network operator can turn 
   on the measurement session of loss rate over path A-B-D-F and segment 
   A-B-C as well as jitter over segment C-E-G-I simultaneously. This 
   feature allows network operators to zoom into the suspicious 
   components when degradation or failure occurs. 

4.3.2. Static v.s. Dynamic configuration 

   A measurement session can be configured statically. In this case, 
   network operators activate the two interfaces or configure their 
   parameter settings on the relevant nodes either manually or 
   automatically through agents of network management system (NMS). 

   Optionally, a measurement session can be configured dynamically. In 
   this case, an interface may coordinate another interface on its 
   forwarding path to start or stop a session. Accordingly, the format 
   and process routines of the measurement session control packets need 
   to be specified. The delivery of such packets SHOULD be reliable and 
   it MUST be possible to secure the delivery of such packets. 

4.3.3. Proactive v.s. on-demand 

   A measurement session can be started either proactively or on demand. 
   Proactive monitoring is either configured to be carried out 
 
 
Bonda, et al.           Expires July 17, 2011                 [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft      IP Multicast PM Requirements          January 2011 
    

   periodically and continuously or preconfigured to act on certain 
   events such as alarm signals. To save resources, operators may turn 
   on measurement sessions proactively for critical performance metrics 
   over the backbone segments of multicast forwarding tree only. This 
   keeps the overall monitoring overhead minimal during normal network 
   operations.  

   In contrast to proactive monitoring, on-demand monitoring is 
   initiated manually and for a limited amount of time to carry out 
   diagnostics. When network performance degradation or service 
   disruption occurs, operators might turn on measurement sessions on-
   demand over the interested segments to facilitate fault localization. 

4.4. Measurement result report 

   The measurement results might be present in two forms: reports or 
   alarms. 

4.4.1. Performance reports 

   Performance reports contain streams of measurement data over a period 
   of time. A data collection agent MAY actively poll the monitoring 
   nodes and collect the measurement reports from all active interfaces. 
   Alternatively, the monitoring nodes might be configured to upload the 
   reports to the specific data collection agents once the data become 
   available. To save bandwidth, the content of the reports might be 
   aggregated and compressed. The period of reporting SHOULD be able to 
   be configured or controlled by rate limitation mechanisms (e.g., 
   exponentially increasing). 

4.4.2. Exceptional alarms 

   On the other hand, the active interfaces of a monitoring node or a 
   third-party MAY be configured to raise alarms when exceptional events 
   such as performance degradation or service disruption occur. Alarm 
   thresholds and the management should be specified for each of the 
   performance metric when the measurement session is configured on this 
   interface. During measurement session, once the value of certain 
   performance metric exceeds the threshold, alarm will be raised and 
   reported to the configured nodes. To prevent huge volume of alarms 
   from overloading the management nodes and network congestion, alarm 
   suppression and aggregation mechanisms SHOULD be employed on the 
   interfaces to limit the rate of alarm report and the volume of data.

5. Design considerations 

   To make the monitoring system feasible and optimal for a SP 
   production network, the following considerations should take into 
   account when design the system. 

5.1. Inline data-plane measurement 

   Measurement results collected by probing packets might be biased or 
   even totally irrelevant given the facts that (1) probing packets 
   collect sampled results only and might not capture the real statistic 
   characteristics of the monitored user traffic. Experiments have 
   demonstrated that the measurement sampled by the probing packets, 
   such as ping probes, might be incorrect if sampling interval is too 
   long [10]; (2) probing packets introduce extra load onto the network. 
   In order to improve accuracy, sampling frequency has to be high 
   enough, which in turn increase network overhead and further bias the 
   measurement results; (3) probing packets are usually not in the same 
   multicast group as user packets and might take different forwarding 
   path given that equal cost multi-path routing (ECMP) and link 
   aggregation (LAG) have been widely adopted in SP network. An out-of-
   band probing packet might take a path totally different from the user 
   packets of the multicast group that it is monitoring. Even if the 
   forwarding path is the same, the intermediate node might apply 
   different queuing and scheduling strategy for the probing packets. As 
   a result, the measured results might be irrelevant. 

   The performance measurement should be "inline" in the sense that the 
   measurement statistics are derived directly from user packets, 
   instead of probing packets. At the same time, unlike offline packet 
   analysis, the measurement is counting user packets at line-speed in 
   real-time without any packet duplication or buffering. 

   To accomplish the inline measurement, some extra packets might need 
   to be injected into user traffic to coordinate measurement across 
   nodes. The volume of these packets SHOULD be keep minimal such that 
   the injection of such packets will not impact measurement accuracy.  

5.2. Scalability 

   The measurement methodology and system architecture MUST be scalable. 
   A multicast network for an SP production network usually comprises of 
   thousands of nodes. Given the scale, the collecting, processing and 
   reporting overhead of performance measurement data SHOULD NOT 
   overwhelm either monitoring nodes or management nodes. The volume of 
   reporting traffic should be reasonable and not cause any network 
   congestion.

5.3. Robustness 

   The measurements MUST be independent of the failure of the underlying 
   multicast network. For example, the monitor SHOULD generate correct 
   measurement result even if some measurement coordinating packets are 
   lost; invalid performance reports should be able to be identified in 
   case that the underlying multicast network is undergoing drastic 
   changes. 

   If dynamic configuration is supported, the delivery of measurement 
   session control packets SHOULD be reliable so that the measurement 
   sessions can be started, ended and performed in a predictable manner. 
   Meanwhile, the control packets SHOULD not be delivered based on the 
   multicast routing decision. This multicast independent characteristic 
   guarantees that the active interfaces are still under control even if 
   the multicast service is malfunctioning. 

   Similarly, if an NMS is used to control the monitoring nodes remotely, 
   the communication between monitoring nodes and the NMS SHOULD be 
   reliable. 

5.4. Security 

   The monitoring system MUST not impose security risks on the network. 
   For example, the monitoring nodes should be prevented from being 
   exploited by third parties to control measurement sessions 
   arbitrarily, which might make the nodes vulnerable for DDoS attacks. 

   If dynamic configuration is supported, the measurement session 
   control packets need to be encrypted and authenticated. 

5.5. Device flexibility 

   Both the software and hardware deployment requirement for the 
   monitoring system SHOULD be reasonable. For example, one-way delay 
   measurement needs clock synchronization across nodes. To require the 
   installation of expensive hardware clock synchronization devices on 
   all monitoring nodes might be too costly to make the monitoring 
   system infeasible for large deployment. 

   The monitor system SHOULD be incrementally deployable, which means 
   that the system can enable monitoring functionality even if some of 
   the nodes in the network are not equipped with the required software 
   and hardware or does not meet the software and hardware deployment 
   requirements.

   The non-monitoring nodes without the monitoring capabilities SHOULD 
   be able to coexist with monitoring nodes and function. The packets 
   exchanged between monitoring nodes SHOULD be transparent to other 
   nodes and MUST not cause any malfunction of the non-monitoring nodes. 

5.6. Extensibility 

   The system should be easy to be extended for new functionalities. For 
   example, the system should be easily extended to collect newly 
   defined performance metrics. 

6. Security Considerations 

   The security issues have been taken into account in design 
   considerations (see Section 5.4). 

7. IANA Considerations 

   There is no IANA action required by this draft.
