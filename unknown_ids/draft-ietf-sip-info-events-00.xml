    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the new INFO method and a mechanism for
      defining, negotiating and exchanging Info Packages that use the INFO
      method. Applications which need to exchange session-related information
      within a SIP INVITE-created dialog use these INFO requests. This draft
      addresses issues and open items from RFC 2976, and replaces it.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>The <xref target="RFC3261">SIP protocol</xref> defines session
      control messages used to setup and tear down a SIP controlled session.
      In addition, a SIP User Agent (UA) can use the re-INVITE and UPDATE
      methods during a session to change the characteristics of the session.
      Most often, this is to change the properties of media flows related to
      the session or to update the <xref target="RFC4028">SIP session
      timer</xref>. The purpose of the <xref target="RFC2976">INFO
      message</xref>, on the other hand, is to carry application level
      information along the SIP signaling path.</t>

      <t>While INFO use has been widely adopted for specific application use
      cases, such as ISUP and DTMF exchange, <xref target="RFC2976">RFC
      2976</xref> neither defined a negotiation mechanism nor a means by which
      to explicitly indicate the type of application information contained in
      the INFO message. This led to problems associated with static
      configuration. In addition, the industry realized there was a potential
      for interoperability problems due to undefined content syntax and
      semantics. This draft addresses these deficiencies, provides a framework
      for explicit negotiation of capabilities and content context using "Info
      Packages".</t>

      <t>The INFO method does not provide any context for the information
      which it carries. While it may sometimes be clear what the content is
      based on the Content-Type, this is only true where there is only one
      contextual usage of the content-type. For example, if the Content-Type
      is "image/jpeg", the MIME-attached content is a JPEG image. However,
      there is no indication what the purpose of the image is. The image could
      be a caller-id picture, a contact icon, a photo for sharing, and so on.
      The sender does not know which JPEG to give the receiver if the receiver
      supports a JPEG content type, and the receiver does not know which JPEG
      the client is sending if the receiver supports receiving more than one
      JPEG content type. Thus there needs to be a well-defined and documented
      statement of what the information sent is for. This situation is
      identical to the <xref target="RFC3458">context issue in Internet
      Mail</xref>. RFC 3458 goes into this and other issues in detail.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3265">Event Packages</xref> perform the role of
      disambiguating the context of a message for Subscription-based events.
      This document provides a similar framework for INVITE-based information
      exchange. The mechanism defined in this draft has no relationship to the
      SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods. The mechanism defined here neither creates
      a separate subscription dialog nor a subscription usage within an
      existing dialog. Instead, it uses the INVITE method and its responses to
      indicate and negotiate supported Info Packages, and the INFO method to
      convey the Info Packages. This mechanism is not appropriate for
      IANA-registered <xref target="RFC3265">Subscribe Event</xref> package
      types. Info Package definitions and registrations indicate support for
      this mechanism when one registers them with IANA.</t>

      <t>Each UA enumerates which Info Packages it can send and receive. If
      the far end indicates it can receive a package offered by the near end,
      the near end can send INFO methods containing the payload for that
      package. Likewise, if the far end indicates it can send a package the
      near end offers it can receive, the far end can send INFO methods
      containing the payload for that package. The Recv-Info header indicates
      which packages a UA is willing to receive and the Send-Info header
      indicates which packages a UA is willing to send. The Package-Info
      header indicates which package a particular INFO method request belongs
      to. The presence of empty Send-Info and Recv-Info headers indicates the
      UA conforms with this document, but does not wish to send or receive
      Info Packages. This enables other UAs that conform with this document to
      detect legacy UAs, as the legacy UA will not include Send-Info or
      Recv-Info headers in their SIP requests. <xref target="S.Nego"></xref>
      describes the negotiation in detail.</t>

      <t>This document does not describe any specific Info Package type
      extensions. One must extend this protocol by other documents, herein
      referred to as "Info Packages." <xref target="S.info-packages"></xref>
      describes guidelines for creating these extensions.</t>

      <t>The INFO method does not change the state of SIP calls or the
      parameters of the sessions SIP initiates. It merely sends optional
      application layer information, generally related to the session.</t>

      <t>Applications need to be aware that application level information
      transported by the INFO method constitutes mid-dialog signaling
      information. These messages traverse the post-session-setup SIP
      signaling path. This is the path taken by SIP re-INVITEs, BYEs, and
      other SIP requests that within an individual dialog. SIP proxy servers
      will receive, and potentially act on, mid-dialog signaling information.
      Application designers need to understand this can be a feature, as when
      the User Agents are exchanging information that elements in the SIP
      signaling path need to be aware of. Conversely, this can be a problem,
      as messages these network elements have no interest in can put a
      significant burden on those element's ability to process other traffic.
      Moreover, such network elements may not be able to read end-to-end
      encrypted INFO bodies.</t>

    <section anchor="S.Nego" title="Info Package Negotiation">
      <t>In this section, "UAC" is the User Agent Client from the perspective
      of the INVITE method. That is, it is the User Agent (UA) that sends the
      initial INVITE method request. This may be somewhat confusing if the
      User Agent Server (UAS) from the perspective of the INVITE method sends
      an INFO method request.</t>

      <section title="Info Package Negotiation Overview">
        <t>Info Package negotiation is similar, but not the same, as <xref
        target="RFC3264">negotiating SDP</xref>. It is similar, in that the
        UAC may offer a set of Send-Info and Recv-Info packages in the initial
        INVITE, the UAS offers its set of Send-Info and Recv-Info pacakges in
        provisional 1xx and final 2xx responses, and the UAC may offer a final
        set of Send-Info and Recv-Info packages in the ACK. Likewise, the UAC
        may chose not to offer any packages in the initial INVITE, and
        negotiate packages from the UAS' subsequent responses and the ACK, in
        order to support <xref target="RFC3725">third-party call
        control</xref>.</t>

        <t>Info Package negotiation MAY occur any time the UAs negotiate
        session parameters. Examples are session establishment, as described
        in the above paragraph; re-INVITE; and <xref
        target="RFC3311">UPDATE</xref>, to name a few. The general rule is
        before a UA may begin sending INFO methods with a given Info Package,
        the UAC must have first indicated it wants to send the Info Package by
        listing it in a Send-Info header in the most recent dialog negotiation
        and the UAS must have positively indicated it is willing to receive
        the Info Package by listing it in a Recv-Info header in the most
        recent dialog negotiation.</t>

        <t>A UA MAY list multiple packages by enumerating the package name(s),
        separated by commas, as values for the Send-Info and Recv-Info headers
        in the session establishment. A UA MAY list multiple packages by
        including multiple Send-Info and Recv-Info headers. A UA MAY combine
        these two methods. We do NOT RECOMMEND listing a package multiple
        times in a given session establishment message, but there is no harm
        in doing so.</t>

        <t>If a UA does not wish to receive any Info Packages, the UA MUST
        indicate this by including an empty Recv-Info header. Likewise, if a
        UA does not wish to send any Info Packages, the UA MUST indicate this
        by including an empty Send-Info header. This enables the other UA to
        discern the difference between the first UA understanding Info
        Packages but not wishing to receive any from a UA that does not
        understand Info Packages.</t>

        <t>The UAC and UAS MUST NOT send an INFO message until the UAC and UAS
        negotiate which Info Packages they support, in which direction. The
        dialog state satisfies this requirement once both the UAC and UAS have
        exchanged Send-Info and Recv-Info headers in the appropriate session
        negotiation messages (INVITE, 1xx, 2xx, ACK, etc.). Once both UAs have
        exchanged Send-Info and Recv-Info headers, the UAC MUST NOT send an
        INFO message carrying a given Info-Package type if the UAC did not
        advertise the package in its Send-Info and the UAS did not advertise
        the package in its Recv-Info. This is the DeMorgan's Theorem of saying
        the UAC may only send an INFO message for the given package if (1) the
        UAC lists the package in its Send-Info and (2) the UAS lists the
        package in its Recv-Info.</t>

        <t>Once a UAC advertises it is willing to receive a package, it MUST
        be ready to receive INFO methods carrying that package type. This is
        because the UAS MAY send such INFO requests at the same time as the
        UAS sends its confirming Send-Info header, and the request may arrive
        out of order. This also enables early exchange of INFO methods.<list>
            <t></t>

            <t>[EDITOR'S NOTE: is not waiting for a dialog to fully establish
            a problem? Personally, I doubt it. Even the corner cases, like
            forking, do not bother me.]</t>

            <t></t>
          </list></t>

        <t>It is important to note that if a UAS does not list a package in
        its Send-Info package list, the UAS MUST NOT send Info Packages from
        that package, even if the UAC listed the package in its Recv-Info
        package list. The UAS will have to renegotiate the session parameters
        to do this. For example, if a UAC offers</t>

]]></artwork>

          <postamble>(postamble)</postamble>
        </figure>

        <t>and the UAS responds</t>

          <preamble>(preamble)</preamble>

          <artwork><![CDATA[Send-Info: P, T
Recv-Info: Q, R]]></artwork>

          <postamble>(postamble)</postamble>
        </figure>

        <t>the UAC MAY start to send INFO messages with type Q, the
        intersection of {P, Q} and {Q, R}. Likewise, the UAS MAY send INFO
        messages with type P, the intersection of {P, T} and {P, R}.</t>

        <t>Such Info Package capability negotiation MUST occur within the
        context of a single session negotiation exchange. Moreover, the last
        capability set received within the exchange is the one the receiver
        applies against its advertised capability set. For example, if in an
        INVITE, the UAC offers</t>

        <figure>
          <preamble>(preamble)</preamble>

          <artwork><![CDATA[Send-Info: P, Q

          <postamble>(postamble)</postamble>
        </figure>

        <t>and the UAS in a 200 OK responds</t>

        <figure>
          <preamble>(preamble)</preamble>

          <artwork><![CDATA[Send-Info: P, T
Recv-Info: Q, R]]></artwork>

          <postamble>(postamble)</postamble>
        </figure>

        <t>and the UAC then confirms in an ACK with</t>

        <figure>
          <preamble>(preamble)</preamble>

          <artwork><![CDATA[Send-Info: P, Q
Recv-Info: T]]></artwork>

          <postamble>(postamble)</postamble>
        </figure>

        <t>the UAS can now send from package T. Moreover, in this example, the
        UAS may not send form package P, as P no longer is in the UAC's Info
        Package set.</t>

        <t>The limitation on requiring the negotiation to occur within the
        context of a session negotiation exchange means that if the UAC issues
        a re-INVITE (after the above ACK) with</t>

        <figure>
          <preamble>(preamble)</preamble>

          <artwork><![CDATA[Recv-Info: P, R, T]]></artwork>

          <postamble>(postamble)</postamble>
        </figure>

        <t>the UAS MUST NOT send any package P INFO methods until the UAS
        re-offers P in its Send-Info header in its 200 OK response.</t>

        <t>INFO does not necessitate the use of "Require" or "Proxy-Require"
        headers. There is no token defined for "Supported" headers. If
        necessary, clients may probe for the support of this version of INFO
        using the OPTIONS request defined in <xref
        target="RFC3261">SIP</xref>.</t>

        <t>The presence of the "Send-Info" or "Recv-Info" header in a message
        is sufficient to indicate support for this version of INFO. Note the
        "methods" parameter for <xref target="RFC3841">Contact</xref> is not
        sufficient to determine if the endpoints support Info Packages, as the
        INFO method supported might be the obsolete <xref target="RFC2976">RFC
        2976</xref> version.</t>

        <t>For Info Packages, this draft does not provide a means of requiring
        support for a specific Info Package. If the far-end UA does not
        indicate support for an Info Package that the local server requires,
        the server MAY terminate the session with a CANCEL or BYE request.</t>

        <t>Since the protocol handshake generates some set of Send-Info and
        Recv-Info packages, including the empty set, the absence of Send-Info
        and Recv-Info headers at the end of session negotiation indicates a
        legacy UA that does not understand the Info Package mechanism
        described in this document. However, be aware a conforming UAC may
        chose to not include the Send-Info and Recv-Info headers in its
        initial INVITE message to a UAS, as described in the next section.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="UAC Behavior">
        <t><list>
            <t>NOTE: In this section, UAC refers to the initiator of an
            INVITE-initiated dialog and not necessarily the UAC receiving an
            INFO method request.</t>

            <t></t>
          </list>A UAC MAY indicate one or more Info Packages it wishes to
        support sending during the INVITE dialog by including their
        IANA-registered names in the Send-Info header field value in the
        INVITE request. Including an empty Send-Info header field indicates
        the UAC does not wish to send any Info Packages at this time. The UAC
        MAY modify the Send-Info list at any time during session
        negotiation.</t>

        <t>The UAC MAY indicate one or more Info Packages it wishes to support
        receiving during the INVITE-created dialog by including their Info
        Package names in the Recv-Info header field in the INVITE request. Not
        including the Recv-Info header field in the INVITE does not
        necessarily mean the UAC will not accept Info Packages during the
        dialog. The UAC MAY include a Recv-Info header in a later phase of the
        session negotiation.</t>

        <t>Once a UAC indicates support for receiving a given Info Package,
        the UAC MUST be ready to accept INFO methods carrying that package
        type.</t>

        <t>When the UAC receives a Recv-Info header field in any provisional
        1xx or 2xx response, it is an indication the UAS supports receiving
        the Info Packages indicated in the header field value. The UAC ignores
        any Info Packages in the Recv-Info header field value from the UAS the
        UAC did not offer in a Send-Info header field. This situation does not
        constitute a protocol failure, as the UAC is not going to send such
        Info Packages. In other words such mismatches do not fail the
        negotiation. However, if the UAS indicates support for receiving an
        Info Package the UAC did not indicate it will send, the UAC MUST NOT
        send such Info Packages.</t>

        <t>When the UAC receives a Send-Info header field in any provisional
        1xx or 2xx final response, it is an indication the UAS supports
        sending Info Package(s) named in the header field value. Note the UAC
        will only receive Info Package(s) the UAC indicates it is willing to
        receive in the Recv-Info header field.</t>

        <t>Once the UAC and UAS establish an early dialog through a 1xx
        provisional response with To-tags, and the UAC has received a
        Recv-Info header field values from the UAS in the response, the UAC
        MAY send any Info Packages supported by the UAS in an INFO message.
        The 2xx final response updates the state of the supported Info
        Packages, such that the 2xx contains the full and final list of
        Send-Info and Recv-Info Info Packages. If the 2xx contains an empty
        Send-Info header field, the UAS is indicating it will not send any,
        and if it contains an empty Recv-Info header field, the UAS will not
        accept any, regardless of what a previous 1xx response might have
        indicated. At this point negotiation is complete.</t>

        <t>Similar rules apply for late Send-Info / Recv-Info negotiation,
        such as an empty INVITE, followed by an offer in the 200 OK and the
        response in the ACK.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="UAS Behavior">
        <t>When a UAS receives an INVITE request, it checks for Send-Info and
        Recv-Info header fields.</t>

        <t>For each Info Package name in the received Send-Info header field
        value, if the UAS wishes to accept receiving such Info Packages from
        the UAC, the UAS MUST copy the type token name(s) of the acceptable
        Info Packages into a Recv-Info header field value in any and all
        subsequent provisional 1xx and final 2xx responses.</t>

        <t>Likewise, for each Info Package name listed in the received
        Recv-Info header field value, if the UAS wishes to send such Info
        Packages to the UAC, the UAC MUST copy the name(s) of those Info
        Packages it wishes to generate into a Send-Info header field value in
        subsequent provisional 1xx and final 2xx responses. The UAS MAY decide
        not to indicate any Info Packages in early 1xx responses, but add them
        or change them in subsequent 1xx and final 2xx responses. If the UAS
        no longer wishes to support an Info Package after the provisional
        response, the UAS MUST indicate such by removing it from the Send-Info
        or Recv-Info header field values in subsequent provisional and the 2xx
        final response, and if no Info Packages are remaining then by
        including the appropriate header field(s) with empty value(s).<list>
            <t></t>

            <t>[EDITOR'S NOTE: The original text said: "The UAS MUST NOT send
            any INFO messages with Info Packages until it has received an
            acknowledgement, such as PRACK for a provisional response or an
            ACK for a final response, that the UAC has received the SIP
            response sent by the UAS, indicating the UAC received the
            Send-Info header field values from the UAS. This assures the UAC
            can perform any necessary logic it needs in order to receive the
            Info Package and can associate the INFO message and associated
            Info Package with the proper dialog." Is it OK to ditch this text?
            In theory, it is "good" to have full handshaking and allow for
            prep work on the part of the UAC. In practice can anyone think of
            situations where this will make a difference? The state machine is
            much simpler without it.]</t>

    <section title="The INFO Method Request">
      <t>In this section, "UAC" is the User Agent Client from the perspective
      of the INFO method. That is, it is the User Agent (UA) that sends the
      INFO method request. This may be somewhat confusing if the UA that is
      sending an INFO method is the User Agent Server (UAS) that received the
      initial SIP INVITE. In this case, the UAS from the INVITE perspective is
      the UAC from the INFO perspective. Be aware this section is strict on
      calling the UAC the UA that is sending the INFO method request.</t>

      <section title="INFO Requests">
        <t>The INFO method communicates application level information along
        the signaling path for the call. The INFO method does not change the
        state of sessions initiated by SIP. Any proposal to have INFO change
        the state of a SIP call is an architectural error and one MUST NOT
        allow it. The INFO method provides additional, application level
        information that can further enhance a SIP application. It is
        important to note there are some types of application information for
        which using INFO messages are inappropriate. See <xref
        target="S.info-packages"></xref> for a discussion of this.</t>

        <t>This draft creates a new, mandatory header field for INFO requests,
        the "Info-Package" header field. The "Info-Package" header field value
        in an INFO request contains a single Info Package token. The token in
        the "Info-Package" header field value MUST match one of the Info
        Package tokens received in the "Recv-Info" header field value in the
        received INVITE for the UAS or response for the UAC. In other words,
        one can only send what the other end is willing to receive.</t>

        <t>One can only use the INFO method within an INVITE-generated dialog
        (early or full) and usage. The INFO method has no lifetime or usage of
        its own, as it is inexorably linked to that of the INVITE. When the
        INVITE-created dialog terminates, that signals the termination of the
        negotiated Info Packages. A UA that receives an INFO message after the
        other UA sends a BYE or CANCEL MUST respond with a 481 Call Does Not
        Exist.</t>

        <t>The dialog identifiers defined in <xref target="RFC3261">RFC
        3261</xref> must match those of the provisional or final responses to
        the INVITE. As a result, INFO requests do not fork. Either UA may send
        INFO requests, once each UA has exchanged the Send-Info/Recv-Info
        header field value indications of what the far-end supports.</t>

        <t>The signaling path for the INFO method is the signaling path
        established as a result of the call setup. This can be direct
        signaling between the calling and called user agents or a signaling
        path involving SIP proxy servers that were involved in the call setup
        and added themselves to the Record-Route header on the initial INVITE
        message.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Responses to the INFO Request Method">
        <t>If a UAS receives an INFO request it MUST send a final response. A
        UAS MUST send a 200 OK response for an INFO request with no message
        body and no Info-Package header if the UAS received the INFO request
        on an existing dialog. This protocol action supports legacy use of
        INFO as a keep-alive mechanism.</t>

        <t>If the UAS receives an INFO request with a Package-Info the UAC
        advertised with a Send-Info in the last dialog state update and the
        UAS advertised with a Recv-Info and the body of the INFO request is an
        appropriate MIME type for the Info Package, the UAS MUST send a 200 OK
        repsonse.</t>

        <t>If the INFO request contains a body that the server does not
        understand then, in the absence of Info Package associated processing
        rules for the body, including the absence of an Info-Package header,
        the server MUST respond with a 415 Unsupported Media Type message.</t>

        <t>If the INFO request indicates an Info Package type that the server
        does not understand, then the server MUST respond with a 489 Bad
        Event. The server then MUST terminate the INVITE dialog, as this
        represents a protocol failure.<list>
            <t></t>

            <t>[EDITOR'S NOTE: I chose 489 as 405 implies a media mis-match
            and 501 implies INFO is not supported. This protocol failure is
            identical to a NOTIFY with an event package the UAS did not
            subscribe to. We could create a new response code if you have
            problems with "Bad Event" implying there is some link between INFO
            and NOTIFY. However, I would offer what we are doing is refining
            489 to mean, "received some package in some context that I do not
            understand," where today the possible contexts are INFO and
            NOTIFY. Work for you?]</t>

            <t></t>
          </list></t>

        <t>If a server receives an INFO request with a body it understands,
        but it has no Info-Package header, the UAS MAY render the body. Note
        the semantics of "rendering" is up to the Info Package definition. The
        UAS MUST respond to the INFO request with a 200 OK. This enables
        legacy use of INFO.</t>

        <t>The UAS MUST send a 481 Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist message
        if the INFO request does not match any existing dialog.</t>

        <t>The UAS MAY send other responses, such as Request Failure (4xx),
        Server Failure (5xx) and Global Failure (6xx) as appropriate for the
        INFO Request.<list>

      <section title="Behavior of SIP User Agents">
        <t>Unless stated otherwise, the protocol rules for the INFO request
        governing the usage of tags, Route and Record-Route, retransmission
        and reliability, CSeq incrementing and message formatting follow those
        in <xref target="RFC3261">RFC 3261</xref> as defined for the BYE
        request.</t>

        <t>A UAC MAY CANCEL an INFO request. A UAS receiving a CANCEL for an
        INFO request SHOULD respond to the INFO with a "487 Request Cancelled"
        response unless the UAC has already sent a final response. The UAS
        then MUST ignore future INFO requests.</t>

        <t>The INFO message MUST NOT change the state of the SIP dialog. The
        only exception to this rule is for specific failure responses as
        documented in <xref target="RFC5057">RFC 5057</xref>, which may cause
        the INVITE dialog to terminate.</t>

      <section title="INFO Message Bodies">
        <t>The INFO request MAY contain a message body. If the request
        contains a message body, the Info Package type extension document MUST
        specify the syntax and semantics of the INFO body.</t>

        <t>The purpose of the INFO message is to carry application level
        information between SIP user agents. The INFO message body SHOULD
        carry this information, unless the message headers carry the
        information of interest.</t>

        <t>In addition, the INFO method does not define mechanisms for
        ensuring in-order delivery. While the UAC will increment the CSeq
        header upon the transmission of new INFO messages, the UAS cannot use
        the CSeq to determine the sequence of INFO information. This is due to
        the fact that there could be gaps in the INFO message CSeq count
        caused by a user agent sending re-INVITES or other SIP messages.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Legacy Uses of INFO">
      <t>Several RFC-defined and other standards-defined uses of <xref
      target="RFC2976">RFC 2976 INFO</xref> exist and are in use, as well as
      numerous proprietary uses. By definition, such uses have relied on
      either static local configuration or implicit context determination
      based on the body Content-Type or Content-Disposition value, or some
      proprietary mechanism. This draft cannot forbid nor avoid such uses,
      since local configuration can always override standardized
      mechanisms.</t>

      <t>To maintain backward compatibility with the extant standardized uses
      of INFO, a server MAY interpret an INFO request with no "Info-Package"
      header as being of such legacy use.</t>

      <t>It should be noted that such legacy use will not "break" the
      mechanism in this draft. For example, if a UA supports <xref
      target="RFC3372">SIP-T</xref>, it does so based on static local
      configuration or based on acceptance of the application/isup body. If it
      adds support for this draft's Info Package negotiation mechanism, the
      local configuration still applies, and the UA will send/receive INFO
      messages based on SIP-T regardless of the Info Package negotiation. It
      will also be able to send/receive INFO messages based on the Info
      Packages it negotiated. If, at some future time, an Info Package is
      defined for SIP-T, the UA can indicate such in the negotiation, and
      again local configuration would supersede if need be. The UA would not
      lose the ability to use SIP-T with legacy devices. Rather, it would gain
      the ability to use it with devices which support this draft and with
      which it did not have such local configuration set, and could avoid
      failures related to unsupported bodies.</t>

      <t>It is the hope of this draft's authors that vendors that implement
      proprietary INFO uses submit their mechanisms as Info Package extension
      documents, and follow the Info Package negotiation mechanism defined in
      this draft.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Info Packages">
      <t>This section covers several issues which one should take into
      consideration when propsing new Info Packages.</t>

      <section anchor="S.info-packages" title="Appropriateness of Usage">
        <t>When designing an Info Package using the method described in this
        document for application level information exchange, it is important
        to consider: is INFO and, more importantly, is signaling within a SIP
        dialog, an appropriate mechanism for the problem set? Is it because it
        is the most reasonable and appropriate choice, or merely because "it's
        easy"?</t>

        <t>These are difficult issues to consider, especially when presented
        with real-world deadlines and implementation cost issues. However,
        choosing to use INFO for inappropriate uses *will* lead to issues in
        the real world, not the least of which are certain types of
        middleboxes which will remove the device from the network if it is
        found to cause damage to other SIP nodes.</t>

        <t>Therefore, the following sections provide consideration guidelines
        and alternatives to INFO use.</t>

        <section title="Dialog Fate-Sharing">
          <t>INFO, by design, is a method within an INVITE dialog usage. <xref
          target="RFC5057">RFC 5057</xref> enumerates the problems with using
          dialogs for multiple usages, and we strongly urge the reader to
          review RFC 5057. The most relevant issue is a failure of
          transmission or processing of an INFO request may render the INVITE
          dialog terminated, depending on the type of failure. Prior to RFC
          5057 it was not clear if the INFO usage was a separate usage or not.
          RFC 5057 clarifies the INFO method is always part of the INVITE
          usage.</t>

          <t>Some uses of INFO can tolerate this fate sharing of the INFO
          message over the entire dialog. For example, in the SIP-T usage, it
          may be acceptable for a call to fail, or to tear down the call, if
          one cannot deliver the associated SS7 information. The same is
          usually true for DTMF. However, it may not be acceptable for a call
          to fail if, for example, a DTMF buffer overflows. Then again, for
          some services, that may be the exact desired behavior.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Messaging Rates and Volume">
          <t>There is no throttling mechanism for INFO. Consider that most
          call signaling occurs on the order of 7-10 messages per 3 minutes,
          although with a burst of 5-7 messages in one second during call
          setup. DTMF tones occur in bursts at a rate of up to 20 messages per
          second. This is a considerably higher rate than for call signaling.
          Sending constant GPS location updates, on the other hand, would
          incur an undue burden on SIP Proxies along the path.</t>

          <t>Furthermore, SIP messages tend to be relatively small, on the
          order of 500 Bytes to 32K Bytes. SIP is a poor mechanism for direct
          exchange of bulk data beyond these limits, especially if the headers
          plus body exceed the <xref target="RFC0768">UDP MTU</xref>.
          Appropriate mechanisms for such traffic include <xref
          target="RFC4975">MSRP</xref>, <xref target="RFC4145">COMEDIA</xref>,
          or <xref target="RFC2616">HTTP</xref>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Is there a better alternative?">
          <t>The design goal of the <xref
          target="RFC3265">SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY</xref> event framework is to meet
          the general need of periodic state notifications/updates. Subscribes
          have their own dialog or usage, and thus can outlive an INVITE one,
          but they can also follow the path of the INVITE-based dialog.</t>

          <t>The <xref target="RFC3428">MESSAGE method</xref> defines one-time
          instant message exchange, typically for sending MIME contents for
          rendering to the user.</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC4975">MSRP</xref> defines session-based instant
          messaging as well as bulk file transfer and other such large-volume
          uses. It is part of an INVITE-based session, similar to other media.
          Unlike INFO, MSRP follows a direct media path, rather than through
          the network elements composing the SIP signaling path.</t>

      <section title="Info Package Responsibilities">
        <t>Info Packages SHOULD NOT reiterate any of the behavior described in
        this document, unless required for clarity or emphasis. However, such
        packages MUST describe the behavior that extends or modifies the
        behavior described in this document.</t>

        <t>Info Packages MUST NOT weaken any behavior designated with "SHOULD"
        or "MUST" in this document. However, Info Packages MAY strengthen
        "SHOULD", "MAY", or "RECOMMENDED" requirements to "MUST" strength if
        the application requires it.</t>

        <t>In addition to the normal sections expected in standards-track RFCs
        and SIP extension documents, authors of Info Packages need to address
        each of the issues detailed in the following subsections, whenever
        applicable.</t>

        <section title="Applicability">
          <t>This section, which MUST be present, describes why any of the
          other established user-to-user data transfer protocols are not
          appropriate for the given Info Package. Common reasons can be a
          requirement for SIP Proxies or back-to-back User Agents (B2BUAs)
          seeing the application level information transfer. Consideration in
          this section MUST describe what happens if one or both endpoints
          encrypt the payload.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Info Package Name">
          <t>This section, which MUST be present, defines the token name that
          designates the Info Package. It MUST include the information that
          appears in the IANA registration of the token. For information on
          registering such types, see <xref target="S.IANA"></xref>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Info Package Parameters">
          <t>If the "Info-Package" header allows parameters to modify the
          behavior of the Info Package, this section MUST clearly define the
          syntax and semantics of such parameters.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="INFO Bodies">
          <t>Each Info Package MUST define what type or types of bodies are
          expected in INFO requests. Such packages MUST specify or cite
          detailed specifications for the syntax and semantics associated with
          such a body.</t>

          <t>Info Packages also MUST define a default MIME type if the
          "Accept" header fails to define any MIME types in the INVITE
          request.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="UA generation of INFO requests">
          <t>Each Info Package MUST describe the process by which a UA
          generates and sends an INFO request. This includes detailed
          information about what events cause the UA to send an INFO
          request.</t>

          <t>This section MAY describe the behavior used to process the
          subsequent response.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="UA processing of INFO requests">
          <t>The Info Package MAY describe the process followed by the UA upon
          receipt of an INFO request. Since INFO does not change SIP state,
          and may not even change application state, there may be no useful
          guidance required in the Info Package specification for UA
          processing.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Rate of notifications">
          <t>Each Info Package MUST define a requirement of SHOULD or MUST
          strength which defines an absolute maximum on the rate at which an
          Info Package can generate INFO messages by a UA in a dialog.</t>

          <t>Each package MAY further define a throttle mechanism that allows
          UAs to further limit the rate of INFO messages.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Examples">
          <t>We RECOMMEND Info Packages include several demonstrative message
          flow diagrams paired with several typical, syntactically correct,
          and complete messages.</t>

          <t>Documents describing Info Packages MUST clearly indicate the
          examples are informative and not normative, with instructions that
          implementers refer to the main text of the document for exact
          protocol details.</t>

          <t>This document adds Info-Package to the definition of the element
          "message-header" in the SIP message grammar.</t>

          <t>For the purposes of matching Info Package types indicated in
          Send-Info or Recv-Info with those in the Info-Package header field
          value, one compares the Info-package-name portion of the
          Info-package-type portion of the "Info-Package" header byte-by-byte
          with that of the same in the "Send-Info" or "Recv-Info" header
          values. The Info-package-param is not part of the comparison
          checking algorithm.</t>

          <t>This document does not define values for Info-Package types.
          Individual Info Packages define these values. Such documents MUST
          register such values with IANA. That is, they are "Specification
          Required."</t>

          <t>There MUST be exactly one Info Package type listed per
          Info-Package header. Multiple Info-Packages per INFO message are
          disallowed.</t>

          <t>[EDITOR NOTE: Really? Why not multiple Info-Packages, in a
          multipart/mime? Well, I thought of one: it is hard to disambiguate.
          For example, take an INFO message with an Info-Package: key_image,
          caller_picture. I then have a multipart/mime with, you guessed it,
          an image/jpeg and an image/jpeg. I would offer we do allow this and
          require the MIME parse order of the body match the order of the
          Info-Package enumerations; if you have too many packages or body
          parts or they do not align, you barf. However, I timed out on this
          and thus we will have to wait for the next version for me to flesh
          this out. If we do do this, then we'll reference RFC 3261 as updated
          by draft-ietf-sip-body-handling to require multipart MIME
          handling.]</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>By eliminating multiple uses of INFO messages without adequate
      community review and by eliminating the possibility for rogue SIP User
      Agents from confusing another User Agent by purposely sending unrelated
      INFO messages, we expect the INFO use clarification to improve the
      security of the Internet.</t>

      <t>There are no specific security issues for this mechanism, beyond
      those already applicable to SIP-based session signaling. In particular,
      if one does not protect the SIP signaling from eavesdropping or
      authentication and repudiation attacks, for example by using TLS
      transport, then the INFO request and its contents will be vulnerable, as
      well. Even with SIP/TLS, any SIP hop along the path from UAC to UAS can
      view, modify, or intercept INFO requests, as they can with any SIP
      request.</t>

      <t>One interesting property of Info Package use is one can reuse the
      same digest-challenge mechanism used for INVITE-based authentication for
      the INFO request. For example one could use a quality-of-protection
      (qop) value of authentication with integrity (auth-int), to challenge
      the request and its body, and prevent intermediate devices from
      modifying the body. However this assumes the device which knows the
      credentials in order to perform the INVITE challenge is still in the
      path for the INFO, or that the far-end UAS knows such credentials.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
            protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
            systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used
            for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers
            and distributed object management systems, through extension of
            its request methods, error codes and headers . A feature of HTTP
            is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing
            systems to be built independently of the data being
            transferred.</t>

            <t>HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information
            initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol
            referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 .</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>Instant Messaging (IM) refers to the transfer of messages
            between users in near real-time. These messages are usually, but
            not required to be, short. IMs are often used in a conversational
            mode, that is, the transfer of messages back and forth is fast
            enough for participants to maintain an interactive conversation.
            This document proposes the MESSAGE method, an extension to the
            Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that allows the transfer of
            Instant Messages. Since the MESSAGE request is an extension to
            SIP, it inherits all the request routing and security features of
            that protocol. MESSAGE requests carry the content in the form of
            MIME body parts. MESSAGE requests do not themselves initiate a SIP
            dialog; under normal usage each Instant Message stands alone, much
            like pager messages. MESSAGE requests may be sent in the context
            of a dialog initiated by some other SIP request. [STANDARDS

            <t>This document describes how to express media transport over TCP
            using the Session Description Protocol (SDP). It defines the SDP
            'TCP' protocol identifier, the SDP 'setup' attribute, which
            describes the connection setup procedure, and the SDP 'connection'
            attribute, which handles connection reestablishment. [STANDARDS

            <t>Media Server Control Markup Language (MSCML) is a markup
            language used in conjunction with SIP to provide advanced
            conferencing and interactive voice response (IVR) functions. MSCML
            presents an application-level control model, as opposed to
            device-level control models. One use of this protocol is for
            communications between a conference focus and mixer in the IETF
            SIP Conferencing Framework. This memo provides information for the
            Internet community.</t>

          <title>Multiple Dialog Usages in the Session Initiation

          <abstract>
            <t>Several methods in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can
            create an association between endpoints known as a dialog. Some of
            these methods can also create a different, but related,
            association within an existing dialog. These multiple
            associations, or dialog usages, require carefully coordinated
            processing as they have independent life-cycles, but share common
            dialog state. Processing multiple dialog usages correctly is not
            completely understood. What is understood is difficult to
            implement.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; This memo argues that multiple
            dialog usages should be avoided. It discusses alternatives to
            their use and clarifies essential behavior for elements that
            cannot currently avoid them.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; This is an
            informative document and makes no normative statements of any
            kind. This memo provides information for the Internet
            community.</t>
