Abstract

   This document specifies an update to the Stateless IP/ICMP
   Translation Algorithm (SIIT) described in RFC 2765.  The algorithm
   translates between IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers (including ICMP
   headers) for both stateless and stateful modes.

Internet-Draft            IPv4/IPv6 Translation            February 2010


1.  Introduction and Motivation

   This document is a product of the 2008-2010 effort to define a
   replacement for NAT-PT [RFC2766].  It is an update to and directly
   derivative from Erik Nordmark's [RFC2765], which similarly provides
   both stateless and stateful translation between IPv4 [RFC0791] and
   IPv6 [RFC2460], and between ICMPv4 [RFC0792] and ICMPv6 [RFC4443].
   The original document was a product of the NGTRANS working group.

   The transition mechanisms specified in [RFC4213] handle the case of
   dual IPv4/IPv6 hosts interoperating with both dual IPv4/IPv6 hosts
   and IPv4-only hosts, which is needed early in the transition to IPv6.
   The dual IPv4/IPv6 hosts are assigned both one or more IPv4 and one
   or more IPv6 addresses.  The number of available globally unique IPv4
   addresses is becoming smaller and smaller as the Internet grows; we
   expect that there will be a desire to take advantage of the large
   IPv6 address space and not require that every new Internet node have
   a permanently and full assigned IPv4 address.  Indeed, due to the
   IPv4 address depletion problem, it is desirable that a single IPv4
   address needs to be shared via transport port multiplexing for
   different IPv6 nodes when they communicate with other IPv4 hosts.

   SIIT [RFC2765] was designed for the case of small networks (e.g., a
   single subnet) and for a site that has IPv6-only hosts in a dual
   IPv4/IPv6 network.  This use case assumes a mechanism for IPv6 nodes
   to acquire a temporary address from the pool of IPv4 addresses.
   However, SIIT is not useful in the case when the IPv6 nodes need to
   acquire temporary IPv4 addresses from a "distant" SIIT box operated
   by a different administration, or require that the IPv6 Internet
   contain routes for IPv4-mapped addresses (the latter is considered to
   be a very bad idea due to the size of the IPv4 routing table that
   would potentially be injected into IPv6 routing in the form of IPv4-
   mapped addresses.)

   Furthermore, in SIIT [RFC2765], an IPv6-only node that works through
   SIIT translators needs some modifications beyond a normal IPv6-only
   node.  These modifications are not required in this document, since
   normal IPv6 addresses can be used in the IPv6 end nodes.

   A detailed discussion of translation scenarios is presented in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework], while the technical specification
   of the translation algorithm itself is covered in this document.

1.1.  IPv4-IPv6 Translation Model

   The translation model is consists of two or more network domains
   connected by one or more IP/ICMP translators (XLATEs) as shown in
   Figure 1.  One of those networks either routes IPv4 but not IPv6, or

   contains some hosts that only implement IPv4 or have IPv4-only
   applications (even if the host and the network support IPv6).  The
   other network either routes IPv6 but not IPv4, or contains some hosts
   that only implement IPv6 or has IPv6-only applications.  Both
   networks contain clients, servers, and peers.  A network domain may
   also consist of a single host.  DNS servers include DNS64 and DNS46,
   while DNS64 translates A record to AAAA record and DNS46 translates
   AAAA record to A record.

                   Figure 1: IPv4-IPv6 Translation Model

   The general IPv4/IPv6 translation framework is described in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework].  This document specifies the
   translation algorithms between IPv4 packets and IPv6 packets.  The
   mapping algorithms between IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses in the
   packet headers are specified in [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].

1.2.  Applicability and Limitations

   The use of this translation algorithm assumes that the IPv6 network
   is somehow well-connected i.e., when an IPv6 node wants to
   communicate with another IPv6 node there is an IPv6 path between
   them.  The IPv4 network is also assumed to be well-connected.
   Various tunneling schemes exist that can provide such paths, but
   those mechanisms and their use is outside the scope of this document
   and [RFC2765].

   As with [RFC2765], the translating function specified in this
   document does not translate any IPv4 options and it does not
   translate IPv6 routing headers, hop-by-hop extension headers,
   destination options headers or source routing headers.

   The issues and algorithms in the translation of datagrams containing
   TCP segments are described in [RFC5382].  The considerations of that
   document are applicable in this case as well.

   Fragmented IPv4 UDP packets that do not contain a UDP checksum (i.e.,
   the UDP checksum field is zero) are not of significant use in the
   Internet [Miller][Dongjin] and will not be translated by the IP/ICMP
   translator.

   IPv4 multicast addresses [RFC3171] cannot be mapped to IPv6 multicast
   addresses [RFC3307] based on the unicast mapping rule.  However, if
   multicast address mapping rule is defined, the IP/ICMP header
   translation aspect of this document works.

1.3.  Stateless vs. Stateful Mode

   An IP/ICMP translator has two possible modes of operation: stateless
   and stateful [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework].  In both cases, we
   assume that a system (a node or an application) that has an IPv4
   address but not an IPv6 address is communicating with a system that
   has an IPv6 address but no IPv4 address, or that the two systems do
   not have contiguous routing connectivity and hence are forced to have
   their communications translated.

   In the stateless mode, a specific IPv6 address range will represent
   IPv4 systems (IPv4-converted addresses), and the IPv6 systems have
   addresses (IPv4-translatable addresses) that can be algorithmically
   mapped to a subset of the service provider's IPv4 addresses.  In
   general, there is no need to concern oneself with translation tables,
   as the IPv4 and IPv6 counterparts are algorithmically related.

   In the stateful mode, a specific IPv6 address range will represent
   IPv4 systems (IPv4-converted addresses), but the IPv6 systems may use
   any [RFC4291] addresses except in that range.  In this case, a
   translation table is required to bind the IPv6 systems' addresses to
   the IPv4 addresses maintained in the translator.

   The address translation mechanisms for the stateless and the stateful
   translations are defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].

1.4.  Path MTU Discovery and Fragmentation

   Due to the different sizes of the IPv4 and IPv6 header, which are 20+
   octets and 40 octets respectively, handling the maximum packet size
   is critical for the operation of the IPv4/IPv6 translator.  There are
   three mechanisms to handle this issue: path MTU discovery (PMTUD),
   fragmentation, and transport-layer negotiation such as the TCP MSS
   option [RFC0879].  Note that the translator MUST behave as a router,
   i.e. the translator MUST send a "Packet Too Big" error message or
   fragment the packet when the packet size exceeds the MTU of the next
   hop interface.

Internet-Draft            IPv4/IPv6 Translation            February 2010


   "Don't Fragment", ICMP "Packet Too Big", and packet fragmentation are
   discussed in sections 3 and 4 of this document.  The reassembling of
   fragmented packets in the stateful translator is discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful], since it requires state
   maintenance in the translator.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Translating from IPv4 to IPv6

   When an IP/ICMP translator receives an IPv4 datagram addressed to a
   destination towards the IPv6 domain, it translates the IPv4 header of
   that packet into an IPv6 header.  The original IPv4 header on the
   packet is removed and replaced by an IPv6 header.  Since the ICMPv6
   [RFC4443], TCP [RFC0793] and UDP [RFC0768] headers contain checksums
   that cover IP header information, if the address mapping algorithm is
   not checksum-neutral, the ICMPv6 and transport-layer headers MUST be
   updated.  The data portion of the packet is left unchanged.  The IP/
   ICMP translator then forwards the packet based on the IPv6
   destination address.

                    Figure 2: IPv4-to-IPv6 Translation

   One of the differences between IPv4 and IPv6, is that in IPv6, path
   MTU discovery is mandatory but it is optional in IPv4.  This implies



Li, et al.               Expires August 15, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            IPv4/IPv6 Translation            February 2010


   that IPv6 routers will never fragment a packet - only the sender can
   do fragmentation.

   When IPv4 node performs path MTU discovery (by setting the Don't
   Fragment (DF) bit in the header), path MTU discovery can operate end-
   to-end, i.e., across the translator.  In this case either IPv4 or
   IPv6 routers (including the translator) might send back ICMP "Packet
   Too Big" messages to the sender.  When the IPv6 routers send these
   ICMPv6 errors they will pass through a translator that will translate
   the ICMPv6 error to a form that the IPv4 sender can understand.  As a
   result, an IPv6 fragment header is only included if the IPv4 packet
   is already fragmented.

   However, when the IPv4 sender does not set the Don't Fragment (DF)
   bit, the translator has to ensure that the packet does not exceed the
   path MTU on the IPv6 side.  This is done by fragmenting the IPv4
   packet so that it fits in 1280-byte IPv6 packets, since that is the
   minimum IPv6 MTU.  Also, when the IPv4 sender does not set the DF bit
   the translator MUST always include an IPv6 fragment header to
   indicate that the sender allows fragmentation.

   The rules in section 3.1 ensure that when packets are fragmented,
   either by the sender or by IPv4 routers, the low-order 16 bits of the
   fragment identification are carried end-to-end, ensuring that packets
   are correctly reassembled.  In addition, the rules in section 3.1 use
   the presence of an IPv6 fragment header to indicate that the sender
   might not be using path MTU discovery (i.e., the packet should not
   have the DF flag set should it later be translated back to IPv4).

   Other than the special rules for handling fragments and path MTU
   discovery, the actual translation of the packet header consists of a
   simple mapping as defined below.  Note that ICMPv4 packets require
   special handling in order to translate the content of ICMPv4 error
   messages and also to add the ICMPv6 pseudo-header checksum.

3.1.  Translating IPv4 Headers into IPv6 Headers

   If the DF flag is not set and the IPv4 packet will result in an IPv6
   packet larger than 1280 bytes, the packet MUST be fragmented so the
   resulting IPv6 packet (with Fragment header added to each fragment)
   will be less than or equal to 1280 bytes.  For example, if the packet
   is fragmented prior to the translation, the IPv4 packets must be
   fragmented so that their length, excluding the IPv4 header, is at
   most 1232 bytes (1280 minus 40 for the IPv6 header and 8 for the
   Fragment header).  The resulting fragments are then translated
   independently using the logic described below.

   If the DF bit is set and the MTU of the next-hop interface is less



Li, et al.               Expires August 15, 2010                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            IPv4/IPv6 Translation            February 2010


   than the total length value of the IPv4 packet plus 20, the
   translator MUST send an ICMPv4 "Fragmentation Needed" error message
   to the IPv4 source address.

   If the DF bit is set and the packet is not a fragment (i.e., the MF
   flag is not set and the Fragment Offset is equal to zero) then the
   translator SHOULD NOT add a Fragment header to the resulting packet.
   The IPv6 header fields are set as follows:

   Version:  6

   Traffic Class:  By default, copied from IP Type Of Service (TOS)
      octet.  According to [RFC2474] the semantics of the bits are
      identical in IPv4 and IPv6.  However, in some IPv4 environments
      these fields might be used with the old semantics of "Type Of
      Service and Precedence".  An implementation of a translator SHOULD
      provide the ability to ignore the IPv4 TOS and always set the IPv6
      traffic class (TC) to zero.  In addition, if the translator is at
      an administrative boundary, the filtering and update
      considerations of [RFC2475] may be applicable.

   Flow Label:  0 (all zero bits)

   Payload Length:  Total length value from IPv4 header, minus the size
      of the IPv4 header and IPv4 options, if present.

   Next Header:  For ICMPv4 (1) changed to ICMPv6 (58), otherwise
      protocol field copied from IPv4 header.

   Hop Limit:  The hop limit is derived from the TTL value in the IPv4
      header.  Since the translator is a router, as part of forwarding
      the packet it needs to decrement either the IPv4 TTL (before the
      translation) or the IPv6 Hop Limit (after the translation).  As
      part of decrementing the TTL or Hop Limit the translator (as any
      router) needs to check for zero and send the ICMPv4 "TTL Exceeded"
      or ICMPv6 "Hop Limit Exceeded" error.

   Source Address:  The IPv4-converted address derived from the IPv4
      source address per [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] section 2.1.

      If the translator gets an illegal source address (e.g. 0.0.0.0,
      127.0.0.1, etc.), the translator SHOULD silently drop the packet
      (as discussed in Section 5.3.7 of [RFC1812]).

   Destination Address:  In the stateless mode, which is to say that if
      the IPv4 destination address is within a range of configured IPv4
      stateless translation prefix, the IPv6 destination address is the
      IPv4-translatable address derived from the IPv4 destination
      address per [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] section 2.1.  A
      workflow example of stateless translation is shown in Appendix of
      this document.

      In the stateful mode, which is to say that if the IPv4 destination
      address is not within the range of any configured IPv4 stateless
      translation prefix, the IPv6 destination address and corresponding
      transport-layer destination port are derived from the Binding
      Information Bases (BIBs) reflecting current session state in the
      translator as described in [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].


   If any IPv4 options are present in the IPv4 packet, the IPv4 options
   MUST be ignored (i.e., there is no attempt to translate the options)
   and the packet translated normally.  However, if an unexpired source
   route option is present then the packet MUST instead be discarded,
   and an ICMPv4 "Destination Unreachable/Source Route Failed" (Type
   3/Code 5) error message SHOULD be returned to the sender.

   If there is a need to add a Fragment header (the DF bit is not set or
   the packet is a fragment) the header fields are set as above with the
   following exceptions:

   IPv6 fields:

      Payload Length:  Total length value from IPv4 header, plus 8 for
         the fragment header, minus the size of the IPv4 header and IPv4
         options, if present.

      Next Header:  Fragment header (44).

   Fragment header fields:

      Next Header:  For ICMPv4 (1) changed to ICMPv6 (58), otherwise
         protocol field copied from IPv4 header.

      Fragment Offset:  Fragment Offset copied from the IPv4 header.

      M flag:  More Fragments bit copied from the IPv4 header.

      Identification:  The low-order 16 bits copied from the
         Identification field in the IPv4 header.  The high-order 16
         bits set to zero.

3.2.  Translating ICMPv4 Headers into ICMPv6 Headers

   All ICMPv4 messages that are to be translated require that the ICMPv6
   checksum field be calculated as part of the translation since ICMPv6,
   unlike ICMPv4, has a pseudo-header checksum just like UDP and TCP.

   In addition, all ICMPv4 packets need to have the Type value
   translated and, for ICMPv4 error messages, the included IP header
   also needs translation.

   The actions needed to translate various ICMPv4 messages are as
   follows:

   ICMPv4 query messages:

      Echo and Echo Reply (Type 8 and Type 0):  Adjust the Type values
         to 128 and 129, respectively, and adjust the ICMP checksum both
         to take the type change into account and to include the ICMPv6
         pseudo-header.

      Information Request/Reply (Type 15 and Type 16):  Obsoleted in
         ICMPv6.  Silently drop.

      Timestamp and Timestamp Reply (Type 13 and Type 14):  Obsoleted in
         ICMPv6.  Silently drop.

      Address Mask Request/Reply (Type 17 and Type 18):  Obsoleted in
         ICMPv6.  Silently drop.

      ICMP Router Advertisement (Type 9):  Single hop message.  Silently
         drop.

      ICMP Router Solicitation (Type 10):  Single hop message.  Silently
         drop.

      Unknown ICMPv4 types:  Silently drop.

      IGMP messages:  While the MLD messages [RFC2710][RFC3590][RFC3810]
         are the logical IPv6 counterparts for the IPv4 IGMP messages
         all the "normal" IGMP messages are single-hop messages and
         should be silently dropped by the translator.  Other IGMP
         messages might be used by multicast routing protocols and,
         since it would be a configuration error to try to have router
         adjacencies across IP/ICMP translators those packets should
         also be silently dropped.

       ICMPv4 error messages:

         Destination Unreachable (Type 3):  For all codes that are not
            explicitly listed below, set the Type field to 1, and adjust
            the ICMP checksum both to take the type change into account
            and to include the ICMPv6 pseudo-header.

            Translate the Code field as follows:

            Code 0, 1 (Net, host unreachable):  Set Code value to 0 (no
               route to destination).

            Code 2 (Protocol unreachable):  Translate to an ICMPv6
               Parameter Problem (Type 4, Code value 1) and make the
               Pointer point to the IPv6 Next Header field.

            Code 3 (Port unreachable):  Set Code value to 4 (port
               unreachable).

            Code 4 (Fragmentation needed and DF set):  Translate to an
               ICMPv6 Packet Too Big message (Type 2) with Code value
               set to 0.  The MTU field needs to be adjusted for the
               difference between the IPv4 and IPv6 header sizes, i.e.
               minimum(advertised MTU+20, MTU_of_IPv6_nexthop,
               (MTU_of_IPv4_nexthop)+20).  Note that if the IPv4 router
               did not set the MTU field (zero), i.e., the router does
               not implement [RFC1191], then the translator MUST use the
               plateau values specified in [RFC1191] to determine a
               likely path MTU and include that path MTU in the ICMPv6
               packet.  (Use the greatest plateau value that is less
               than the returned Total Length field.)

            Code 5 (Source route failed):  Set Code value to 0 (No route
               to destination).  Note that this error is unlikely since
               source routes are not translated.

            Code 6,7:  Set Code value to 0 (No route to destination).

            Code 8:  Set Code value to 0 (No route to destination).

            Code 9, 10 (Communication with destination host
            administratively prohibited):  Set Code value to 1
               (Communication with destination administratively

             Figure 3: Pointer value for translating from IPv4 to IPv6

         ICMP Error Payload:  If the received ICMPv4 packet contains an
            ICMPv4 Extension [RFC4884], the translation of the ICMPv4
            packet will cause the ICMPv6 packet to change length.  When
            this occurs, the ICMPv6 Extension length attribute MUST be
            adjusted accordingly (e.g., longer due to the translation
            from IPv4 to IPv6).  If the ICMPv4 Extension exceeds the
            maximum size of an ICMPv6 message on the outgoing interface,
            the ICMPv4 extension should be simply truncated.  For
            extensions not defined in [RFC4884], the translator passes
            the extensions as opaque bit strings and those containing
            IPv4 address literals will not have those addresses
            translated to IPv6 address literals; this may cause problems
            with processing of those ICMP extensions.

3.3.  Translating ICMPv4 Error Messages into ICMPv6

   There are some differences between the ICMPv4 and the ICMPv6 error
   message formats as detailed above.  In addition, the ICMP error
   messages contain for the packet in error, which needs to be
   translated just like a normal IP packet.  The translation of this
   "packet in error" is likely to change the length of the datagram.
   Thus the Payload Length field in the outer IPv6 header might need to
   be updated.

   The translation of the inner IP header can be done by invoking the
   function that translated the outer IP headers.  This process SHOULD
   stop at first embedded header and drop the packet if it contains
   more.

3.4.  Translator Sending ICMPv4 Error Message

   If the IPv4 packet is discarded, then the translator SHOULD be able
   to send back an ICMPv4 error message to the original sender of the
   packet, unless the discarded packet is itself an ICMPv4 message.  The
   ICMPv4 message, if sent, has a Type value of 3 (Destination
   Unreachable) and a Code value of 13 (Communication Administratively
   Prohibited), unless otherwise specified in this document or in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].  The translator SHOULD allow
   an administrator to configure whether the ICMPv4 error messages are
   sent, rate-limited, or not sent.

3.5.  Transport-layer Header Translation

   If the address translation algorithm is not checksum neutral, the
   recalculation and updating of the transport-layer headers MUST be
   performed.

   When a translator receives an unfragmented UDP IPv4 packet and the
   checksum field is zero, the translator SHOULD compute the missing UDP
   checksum as part of translating the packet.  Also, the translator
   SHOULD maintain a counter of how many UDP checksums are generated in
   this manner.

   When a stateless translator receives the first fragment of a

Internet-Draft            IPv4/IPv6 Translation            February 2010


   fragmented UDP IPv4 packet and the checksum field is zero, the
   translator SHOULD drop the packet and generate a system management
   event specifying at least the IP addresses and port numbers in the
   packet.  When it receives fragments other than the first, it SHOULD
   silently drop the packet, since there is no port information to log.

   For stateful translator, the handling of fragmented UDP IPv4 packets
   with a zero checksum is discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] section 3.1.

3.6.  Knowing when to Translate

   If the IP/ICMP translator also provides normal forwarding function,
   and the destination IPv4 address is reachable by a more specific
   route without translation, the translator MUST forward it without
   translating it.  Otherwise, when an IP/ICMP translator receives an
   IPv4 datagram addressed to an IPv4 destination representing a host in
   the IPv6 domain, the packet MUST be translated to IPv6.


4.  Translating from IPv6 to IPv4

   When an IP/ICMP translator receives an IPv6 datagram addressed to a
   destination towards the IPv4 domain, it translates the IPv6 header of
   the received IPv6 packet into an IPv4 header.  The original IPv6
   header on the packet is removed and replaced by an IPv4 header.
   Since the ICMPv6 [RFC4443], TCP [RFC0793], and UDP [RFC0768] headers
   contain checksums that cover the IP header, if the address mapping
   algorithm is not checksum-neutral, the ICMP and transport-layer
   headers MUST be updated.  The data portion of the packet is left
   unchanged.  The IP/ICMP translator then forwards the packet based on
   the IPv4 destination address.

                    Figure 5: IPv6-to-IPv4 Translation

   There are some differences between IPv6 and IPv4 in the area of
   fragmentation and the minimum link MTU that affect the translation.
   An IPv6 link has to have an MTU of 1280 bytes or greater.  The
   corresponding limit for IPv4 is 68 bytes.  Thus, unless there were
   special measures, it would not be possible to do end-to-end path MTU
   discovery when the path includes a translator, since the IPv6 node
   might receive ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" messages originated by an IPv4
   router that report an MTU less than 1280.  However, [RFC2460] section
   5 requires that IPv6 nodes handle such an ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big"
   message by reducing the path MTU to 1280 and including an IPv6
   fragment header with each packet.  In this case, the translator
   SHOULD set DF to 0 and take the identification value from the IPv6
   fragment header when a fragmentation header with (MF=0; Offset=0) is
   present or set DF to 1 otherwise.  This allows end-to-end path MTU
   discovery across the translator as long as the path MTU is 1280 bytes
   or greater.  When the path MTU drops below the 1280 limit, the IPv6
   sender will originate 1280-byte packets that will be fragmented by
   IPv4 routers along the path after being translated to IPv4.

   The drawback with this scheme is that it is not possible to use PMTU
   discovery to do optimal UDP fragmentation (as opposed to completely
   avoiding fragmentation) at the sender, since the presence of an IPv6
   Fragment header is interpreted that it is okay to fragment the packet
   on the IPv4 side.  Thus if a UDP application wants to send large
   packets independent of the PMTU, the sender will only be able to
   determine the path MTU on the IPv6 side of the translator.  If the
   path MTU on the IPv4 side of the translator is smaller, then the IPv6
   sender will not receive any ICMPv6 "Too Big" errors and cannot adjust
   the size fragments it is sending.

   On the other hand, the recent study indicates that only 43.46% of
   IPv6-capable web servers include an IPv6 fragmentation header in
   their respond packets after they were sent an ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big"
   message specifying an MTU<1280 bytes [Stasiewicz].  A workaround to
   this problem (ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" message with MTU<1280) is that
   if there is no fragmentation header in the IPv6 packet, the
   translator SHOULD set DF to 0 for the packets equal to or smaller
   than 1280 bytes and set DF to 1 for packets larger than 1280 bytes.
   In addition, the translator SHOULD take the identification value from
   the IPv6 fragmentation header if presents or generate the
   identification value otherwise.  This avoids the introduction of the
   path MTU discovery black hole.  The header translation defined in the
   next section uses this method.

   Other than the special rules for handling fragments and path MTU
   discovery, the actual translation of the packet header consists of a
   simple mapping as defined below.  Note that ICMPv6 packets require
   special handling in order to translate the contents of ICMPv6 error
   messages and also to remove the ICMPv6 pseudo-header checksum.

4.1.  Translating IPv6 Headers into IPv4 Headers

   If there is no IPv6 Fragment header, the IPv4 header fields are set
   as follows:

   Version:  4

   Internet Header Length:  5 (no IPv4 options)

   Type of Service (TOS) Octet:  By default, copied from the IPv6
      Traffic Class (all 8 bits).  According to [RFC2474] the semantics
      of the bits are identical in IPv4 and IPv6.  However, in some IPv4
      environments, these bits might be used with the old semantics of
      "Type Of Service and Precedence".  An implementation of a
      translator SHOULD provide the ability to ignore the IPv6 traffic
      class and always set the IPv4 TOS Octet to a specified value.  In
      addition, if the translator is at an administrative boundary, the
      filtering and update considerations of [RFC2475] may be
      applicable.

   Total Length:  Payload length value from IPv6 header, plus the size
      of the IPv4 header.

   Identification:  If the packet size is equal to or smaller than 1280
      bytes, generate the identification value.  If the packet size is
      greater than 1280 bytes, set Identification All zeros.

Internet-Draft            IPv4/IPv6 Translation            February 2010


   Flags:  The More Fragments (MF) flag is set to zero.  If the packet
      size is equal to or smaller than 1280 bytes, the Don't Fragments
      (DF) flag is set to zero.  If the packet size is greater than 1280
      bytes, the Don't Fragments (DF) flag is set to one.

   Fragment Offset:  All zeros.

   Time to Live:  Time to Live is derived from Hop Limit value in IPv6
      header.  Since the translator is a router, as part of forwarding
      the packet it needs to decrement either the IPv6 Hop Limit (before
      the translation) or the IPv4 TTL (after the translation).  As part
      of decrementing the TTL or Hop Limit the translator (as any
      router) needs to check for zero and send the ICMPv4 "TTL Exceeded"
      or ICMPv6 "Hop Limit Exceeded" error.

   Protocol:  For ICMPv6 (58) changed to ICMPv4 (1), otherwise Next
      Header field copied from IPv6 header.

   Header Checksum:  Computed once the IPv4 header has been created.

   Source Address:  In the stateless mode, which is to say that if the
      IPv6 source address is within the range of a configured IPv6
      translation prefix, the IPv4 source address is derived from the
      IPv6 source address per [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] section
      2.1.  Note that the original IPv6 source address is an IPv4-
      translatable address.  A workflow example of stateless translation
      is shown in Appendix of this document.  If the translator only
      supports stateless mode and if the IPv6 source address is not
      within the range of configured IPv6 prefix(es), the translator
      SHOULD drop the packet and respond with an ICMPv6 Type=1, Code=5
      (Destination Unreachable, Source address failed ingress/egress
      policy).

      In the stateful mode, which is to say that if the IPv6 source
      address is not within the range of any configured IPv6 stateless
      translation prefix, the IPv4 source address and transport-layer
      source port corresponding to the IPv4-related IPv6 source address
      and source port are derived from the Binding Information Bases
      (BIBs) as described in [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].

      In stateless and stateful modes, if the translator gets an illegal
      source address (e.g. ::1, etc.), the translator SHOULD silently
      drop the packet.

   Destination Address:  The IPv4 destination address is derived from
      the IPv6 destination address of the datagram being translated per
      [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] section 2.1.  Note that the
      original IPv6 destination address is an IPv4-converted address.

   If any of an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options header, Destination Options
   header, or Routing header with the Segments Left field equal to zero
   are present in the IPv6 packet, those IPv6 extension headers MUST be
   ignored (i.e., there is no attempt to translate the extension
   headers) and the packet translated normally.  However, the Total
   Length field and the Protocol field is adjusted to "skip" these
   extension headers.

   If a Routing header with a non-zero Segments Left field is present
   then the packet MUST NOT be translated, and an ICMPv6 "parameter
   problem/erroneous header field encountered" (Type 4/Code 0) error
   message, with the Pointer field indicating the first byte of the
   Segments Left field, SHOULD be returned to the sender.

   If the IPv6 packet contains a Fragment header, the header fields are
   set as above with the following exceptions:

   Total Length:  Payload length value from IPv6 header, minus 8 for the
      Fragment header, plus the size of the IPv4 header.

   Identification:  Copied from the low-order 16-bits in the
      Identification field in the Fragment header.

   Flags:  The More Fragments (MF) flag is copied from the M flag in the
      Fragment header.  The Don't Fragments (DF) flag is set to zero
      allowing this packet to be fragmented if required by IPv4 routers.

   Fragment Offset:  Copied from the Fragment Offset field in the
      Fragment header.

   Protocol:  For ICMPv6 (58) changed to ICMPv4 (1), otherwise Next
      Header field copied from Fragment header.

4.2.  Translating ICMPv6 Headers into ICMPv4 Headers

   All ICMPv6 messages that are to be translated require that the ICMPv4
   checksum field be updated as part of the translation since ICMPv6
   (unlike ICMPv4) includes a pseudo-header in the checksum just like
   UDP and TCP.

   In addition all ICMP packets need to have the Type value translated
   and, for ICMP error messages, the included IP header also needs
   translation.  Note that the IPv6 addresses in the IPv6 header may not
   be IPv4-translatable addresses and there will be no corresponding
   IPv4 addresses represented of this IPv6 address.  In this case, the
   translator can ether do stateful translation or map them to an IPv4
   address block as a holder for all non IPv4-translatable IPv6
   addresses in a stateless manner.

   The actions needed to translate various ICMPv6 messages are:

   ICMPv6 informational messages:

      Echo Request and Echo Reply (Type 128 and 129):  Adjust the Type
         values to 8 and 0, respectively, and adjust the ICMP checksum
         both to take the type change into account and to exclude the
         ICMPv6 pseudo-header.

      MLD Multicast Listener Query/Report/Done (Type 130, 131, 132):
         Single hop message.  Silently drop.

      Neighbor Discover messages (Type 133 through 137):  Single hop
         message.  Silently drop.

      Unknown informational messages:  Silently drop.

   ICMPv6 error messages:

      Destination Unreachable (Type 1)  Set the Type field to 3, and
         adjust the ICMP checksum both to take the type change into
         account and to exclude the ICMPv6 pseudo-header.  Translate the
         Code field as follows:

         Code 0 (no route to destination):  Set Code value to 1 (Host
            unreachable).

         Code 1 (Communication with destination administratively
         prohibited):  Set Code value to 10 (Communication with
            destination host administratively prohibited).

         Code 2 (Beyond scope of source address):  Set Code value to 1
            (Host unreachable).  Note that this error is very unlikely
            since an IPv4-translatable source address is typically
            considered to have global scope.

         Code 3 (Address unreachable):  Set Code value to 1 (Host
            unreachable).

         Code 4 (Port unreachable):  Set Code value to 3 (Port
            unreachable).

         Other Code values:  Silently drop.

         Unreachable (Type 3) with Code value equal to 4, and adjust the
         ICMPv4 checksum both to take the type change into account and
         to exclude the ICMPv6 pseudo-header.  The MTU field needs to be
         adjusted for the difference between the IPv4 and IPv6 header
         sizes taking into account whether or not the packet in error
         includes a Fragment header, i.e. minimum(advertised MTU-20,
         MTU_of_IPv4_nexthop, (MTU_of_IPv6_nexthop)-20)

      Time Exceeded (Type 3):  Set the Type value to 11, and adjust the

      ICMP Error Payload:  If the received ICMPv6 packet contains an
         ICMPv6 Extension [RFC4884], the translation of the ICMPv6
         packet will cause the ICMPv4 packet to change length.  When
         this occurs, the ICMPv6 Extension length attribute MUST be
         adjusted accordingly (e.g., shorter due to the translation from
         IPv6 to IPv4).  For extensions not defined in [RFC4884], the
         translator passes the extensions as opaque bit strings and
         those containing IPv6 address literals will not have those
         addresses translated to IPv4 address literals; this may cause
         problems with processing of those ICMP extensions.

4.3.  Translating ICMPv6 Error Messages into ICMPv4

   There are some differences between the ICMPv4 and the ICMPv6 error
   message formats as detailed above.  In addition, the ICMP error
   messages contain for the packet in error, which needs to be
   translated just like a normal IP packet.  The translation of this
   "packet in error" is likely to change the length of the datagram thus
   the Total Length field in the outer IPv4 header might need to be
   updated.

   The translation of the inner IP header can be done by invoking the
   function that translated the outer IP headers.  This process SHOULD
   stop at first embedded header and drop the packet if it contains
   more.  Note that the IPv6 addresses in the IPv6 header may not be
   IPv4-translatable addresses and there will be no corresponding IPv4
   addresses.  In this case, the translator can ether do stateful
   translation or map them to an IPv4 address block as a holder for all
   non IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.

4.4.  Translator Sending ICMPv6 Error Message

   If the IPv6 packet is discarded, then the translator SHOULD be able
   to send back an ICMPv6 error message to the original sender of the
   packet, unless the discarded packet is itself an ICMPv6 message.

   If the reason of sending ICMPv6 is due to that the IPv6 source
   address is not an IPv4-translatable address and the translator is
   stateless, the ICMPv6 message, if sent, has a Type value 1 and Code
   value 5 (Source address failed ingress/egress policy).  In other
   cases, the ICMPv6 message has a Type value of 1 (Destination
   Unreachable) and a Code value of 1 (Communication with destination
   administratively prohibited), unless otherwise specified in this
   document or [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].  The translator
   SHOULD allow an administrator to configure whether the ICMPv6 error
   messages are sent, rate-limited, or not sent.

4.5.  Transport-layer Header Translation

   If the address translation algorithm is not checksum neutral, the
   recalculation and updating of the transport-layer headers MUST be
   performed.

4.6.  Knowing when to Translate

   If the IP/ICMP translator also provides normal forwarding function,
   and the destination address is reachable by a more specific route
   without translation, the router MUST forward it without translating
   it.  When an IP/ICMP translator receives an IPv6 datagram addressed
   to an IPv6 address representing an host in IPv4 domain, the IPv6
   packet MUST be translated to IPv4.

   This memo adds no new IANA considerations.

   Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
   correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are
   required, or if those assignments or registries are created during
   the RFC publication process.  From the author's perspective, it may
   therefore be removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor's
   discretion.

Internet-Draft            IPv4/IPv6 Translation            February 2010


   security issues beyond the security issues that are already present
   in the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols and in the routing protocols that are
   used to make the packets reach the translator.

   There are potential issues that might arise by deriving an IPv4
   address from an IPv6 address - particularly addresses like broadcast
   or loopback addresses and the non IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses,
   etc.  The [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] addresses these issues.

   As the Authentication Header [RFC4302] is specified to include the
   IPv4 Identification field and the translating function is not able to
   always preserve the Identification field, it is not possible for an
   IPv6 endpoint to verify the AH on received packets that have been
   translated from IPv4 packets.  Thus AH does not work through a
   translator.

   Packets with ESP can be translated since ESP does not depend on
   header fields prior to the ESP header.  Note that ESP transport mode
   is easier to handle than ESP tunnel mode; in order to use ESP tunnel
   mode, the IPv6 node needs to be able to generate an inner IPv4 header
   when transmitting packets and remove such an IPv4 header when
   receiving packets.

   A translator (XLATE) connects the IPv6 network to the IPv4 network.
   This XLATE uses the Network Specific Prefix (NSP) 2001:DB8:100::/40
   defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] to represent IPv4
   addresses in the IPv6 address space (IPv4-converted addresses) and to
   represent IPv6 addresses (IPv4-translatable addresses) in the IPv4
   address space.  In this example, 192.0.2.0/24 is the IPv4 block of
   the corresponding IPv4-translatable addresses.

   Based on the address mapping rule, the IPv6 node H6 has an IPv4-
   translatable IPv6 address 2001:DB8:1C0:2:21:: (address mapping from
   192.0.2.33).  The IPv4 node H4 has IPv4 address 166.111.1.2.

   The IPv6 routing is configured in such a way that the IPv6 packets
   addressed to a destination address in 2001:DB8:100::/40 are routed to
   the IPv6 interface of the XLATE.

   The IPv4 routing is configured in such a way that the IPv4 packets
   addressed to a destination address in 192.0.2.0/24 are routed to the
   IPv4 interface of the XLATE.

8.1.  H6 establishes communication with H4

   The steps by which H6 establishes communication with H4 are:

   1.  H6 performs the destination address mapping, so the IPv4-
       converted address 2001:DB8:1a6:6f01:200:: is formed from
       166.111.1.2 based on the address mapping algorithm
       [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].

   2.  H6 sends a packet to H4.  The packet is sent from a source
       address 2001:DB8:1C0:2:21:: to a destination address 2001:DB8:
       1a6:6f01:200::.

   3.  The packet is routed to the IPv6 interface of the XLATE (since
       IPv6 routing is configured that way).

   4.  The XLATE receives the packet and performs the following actions:

       *  The XLATE translates the IPv6 header into an IPv4 header using
          the IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm defined in this document.

       *  The XLATE includes 192.0.2.33 as source address in the packet
          and 166.111.1.2 as destination address in the packet.  Note
          that 192.0.2.33 and 166.111.1.2 are extracted directly from
          the source IPv6 address 2001:DB8:1C0:2:21:: (IPv4-translatable
          address) and destination IPv6 address 2001:DB8:1a6:6f01:200::
          (IPv4-converted address) of the received IPv6 packet that is
          being translated.

   5.  The XLATE sends the translated packet out its IPv4 interface and
       the packet arrives at H4.

   6.  H4 node responds by sending a packet with destination address
       192.0.2.33 and source address 166.111.1.2.

   7.  The packet is routed to the IPv4 interface of the XLATE (since
       IPv4 routing is configured that way).  The XLATE performs the
       following operations:

       *  The XLATE translates the IPv4 header into an IPv6 header using
          the IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm defined in this document.

       *  The XLATE includes 2001:DB8:1C0:2:21:: as destination address
          in the packet and 2001:DB8:1a6:6f01:200:: as source address in
          the packet.  Note that 2001:DB8:1C0:2:21:: and 2001:DB8:1a6:
          6f01:200:: are formed directly from the destination IPv4
          address 192.0.2.33 and source IPv4 address 166.111.1.2 of the
          received IPv4 packet that is being translated.

   8.  The translated packet is sent out the IPv6 interface to H6.

   The packet exchange between H6 and H4 continues until the session is
   finished.

8.2.  H4 establishes communication with H6

   The steps by which H4 establishes communication with H6 are:

   1.  H4 performs the destination address mapping, so 192.0.2.33 is
       formed from IPv4-translatable address 2001:DB8:1C0:2:21:: based
       on the address mapping algorithm
       [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].

   2.  H4 sends a packet to H6.  The packet is sent from a source
       address 166.111.1.2 to a destination address 192.0.2.33.

   3.  The packet is routed to the IPv6 interface of the XLATE (since
       IPv6 routing is configured that way).

   4.  The XLATE receives the packet and performs the following actions:

       *  The XLATE translates the IPv4 header into an IPv6 header using
          the IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm defined in this document.

       *  The XLATE includes 2001:DB8:1a6:6f01:200:: as source address
          in the packet and 2001:DB8:1C0:2:21:: as destination address
          in the packet.  Note that 2001:DB8:1a6:6f01:200:: (IPv4-
          converted address) and 2001:DB8:1C0:2:21:: (IPv4-translatable
          address) are obtained directly from the source IPv4 address
          166.111.1.2 and destination IPv4 address 192.0.2.33 of the
          received IPv4 packet that is being translated.

   5.  The XLATE sends the translated packet out its IPv6 interface and
       the packet arrives at H6.

   6.  H6 node responds by sending a packet with destination address
       2001:DB8:1a6:6f01:200:: and source address 2001:DB8:1C0:2:21::.

   7.  The packet is routed to the IPv6 interface of the XLATE (since
       IPv6 routing is configured that way).  The XLATE performs the
       following operations:

       *  The XLATE translates the IPv6 header into an IPv4 header using
          the IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm defined in this document.

       *  The XLATE includes 166.111.1.2 as destination address in the
          packet and 192.0.2.33 as source address in the packet.  Note
          that 166.111.1.2 and 192.0.2.33 are formed directly from the
          destination IPv6 address 2001:DB8:1a6:6f01:200:: and source
          IPv6 address 2001:DB8:1C0:2:21:: of the received IPv6 packet
          that is being translated.

   8.  The translated packet is sent out the IPv4 interface to H4.

   The packet exchange between H4 and H6 continues until the session
   finished.
