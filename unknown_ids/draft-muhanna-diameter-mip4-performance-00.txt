   Current Mobile IPv4 deployments use RADIUS based MIPv4 user
   authentication and authorization.  Diameter Mobile IPv4 Application
   [RFC4004] offers another method for MIPv4 authentication,
   authorization, and dynamic mobility security association allocation,
   e.g.  MN-HA SA allocation.  Some SDOs are considering the use of
   Diameter Mobile IPv4 Application to replace RADIUS based mechanism.

   mobile node uses during the initial session setup.  Some common MIPv4
   scenarios which require the mobile node to retransmit its initial RRQ

2.  Introduction

   RADIUS based MIPv4 user authentication and authorization and to some
   extent MN-HA SA allocation model is widely used in current Mobile
   IPv4 deployments.  On the other hand, Diameter Mobile IPv4
   Application [RFC4004] offers another model for MIPv4 authentication,
   authorization, and dynamic mobility security association allocation,
   e.g.  MN-HA SA allocation.  Some SDOs are currently evaluating and
   considering the use of Diameter Mobile IPv4 Application to replace
   RADIUS based mechanism.  This document presents an analysis of the
   expected performance and impact of Diameter MIPv4 Application model
   in comparison to RADIUS based solutions on the amount of time the
   mobile node uses during the initial session setup.

   During mobile IPv4 session setup, in many occasions and due to
   several network conditions, the MN is required to retransmit the
   initial RRQ to successfully register its point of attachment with its
   Home agent.  In section 4, some of the common MIPv4 scenarios, which
   require the mobile node to retransmit its initial RRQ message have
   been identified and used as a base for this analysis.  Moreover, the
   set of assumptions and requirements used for this analysis has
   clearly been documented under section 5.

   After this Introduction, a brief summary and background of the Mobile
   IPv4 Authentication and Authorization models are introduced under
   section 3.  Section 4 present how mobile IPv4 initial registration
   request message is retransmitted during initial session setup and its
   handling in the different authentication and authorization models.
   Common scenarios which require the mobile node to retransmit initial
   RRQ are also presented.  In section 5, all the requirements and
   assumptions used in the analysis of this study are captured.
   Sections 6 and 7 present the behavior of RADIUS and Diameter Mobile
   IPv4 Application models, respectively.  The summary and conclusion of
   this study is presenetd under section 8.

3.  Mobile IPv4 Authentication and Authorization Models

   Currently, there are several Mobile IPv4 deployments which use
   standard RADIUS AAA protocol (e.g.  RFC2865) to authenticate and
   authorize mobile IPv4, MIPv4, users.  In these deployments, Foreign
   Agent, FA, for example, uses RADIUS protocol to communicate with the
   home AAA server to authenticate MIPv4 users using MN-AAA
   Authentication extension in a CHAP-like mechanism [RFC3012].
   Although, there is not a standardized defined interface between the
   Home Agent and the home AAA server, yet, these deployments use RADIUS
   to authenticate, authorize, and sometimes to download a dynamic MN-HA
   security association parameters, for example, MN-HA secret key.

   In the RADIUS based MIPv4 model, the access network, FA, uses one
   round trip to authenticate the MIPv4 user by validating the MIPv4 RRQ
   using the MN-AAA authentication extension via the Home AAA, H-AAA.
   As soon as the FA receive a successful authentication indication it
   relays the Mobile IPv4 Registration Request message, RRQ, to the HA
   to do its validation and authorization of the user.  If the HA does
   not have the proper security parameters available after receiving the
   user initial RRQ, the HA uses RADIUS protocol to download the MN-HA
   SA parameters, e.g.  MN-HA secret key, from the home AAA server.
   Figure 1 presents an example of the call flow of a MIPv4 session
   establishment using RADIUS based AAA protocol for MIPv4 user
   authentication and authorization.

   Alternatively, Diameter Mobile IPv4 Application [RFC4004] introduces
   a new mechanism for MIPv4 user authentication and authorization using
   Diameter as AAA protocol.  In this application, initial mobile IPv4
   registration (RRQ and RRP messages) between the FA and HA is
   completely transported via the Diameter AAA infrastructure using
   Diameter AMR and AMA messages to carry the MIPv4 RRQ and RRP messages
   in addition to other authentication, authorization, and dynamic SA
   attributes.  Figure 2 presents an example of the call flow of a MIPv4
   session setup using Diameter MIPv4 Application as AAA protocol for
   MIPv4 user authenticating and authorization.

4.  Authentication and Authorization Model and MIPv4 RRQ Retransmission

   Mobile IPv4 protocol [RFC3344] uses UDP transport for MIPv4 control
   messages, registration request and registration reply.  Since UDP
   transport does not guarantee delivery of its packets, MIPv4 protocol
   offers its own retransmission mechanism to guarantee delivery of
   MIPv4 control messages as in section 3.6.3.  [RFC3344].

   According to RFC3344, if the mobile node does not receive a
   registration replay within a period of time, the mobile node MUST NOT
   retransmit the registration request within less than 1 second from
   the time it sent the initial RRQ.  RFC3344 also requires that the
   mobile node SHOULD at least wait twice the previous period before the
   next retransmission.  In wireless network, air link resources is very
   expensive and getting the mobile node to register with the HA as
   quickly as possible is a high priority.  In order to achieve this
   objective, the mobile node, in many deployments, retransmits its
   initial registration request after only 1 second of its initial RRQ.

   When FA receives the initial RRQ, FA contacts its local AAA server in
   order to facilitate the MIPv4 user authentication and authorization



Muhanna & Khalil        Expires December 30, 2007               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  MIP4 AAA Performance: RADIUS vs. Diameter      June 2007


   by contacting the home AAA server of the MIPv4 user.  While the FA is
   trying to authenticate and authorize the MIPv4 user credential using
   information from the initial RRQ, the following scenarios present the
   main possible MIPv4 registration request retransmissions:

   1.  FA receives a retransmitted RRQ from the MN before receiving a
       response from the home AAA server via its local AAA server.

   2.  FA receives a retransmitted RRQ after the FA has already received
       a successful response from the home AAA server but the FA has not
       yet relayed the initial RRQ to the HA.

   3.  FA receives a retransmitted RRQ after the FA has already received
       a successful response from the home AAA server and after the FA
       has already relayed the initial RRQ to the HA and waiting for the
       RRP.

   4.  FA receives a retransmitted RRQ after the FA already has received
       a MIPv4 registration reply from the HA but has not yet relayed
       the reply to the mobile node.


   The first three scenarios capture the most common scenarios of the
   retransmission of the initial MIPv4 RRQ while the FA is trying to
   authenticate and authorize the MIPv4 user.  The fourth scenario does
   not happen while the FA is waiting for the MIPv4 authentication and
   authorization, however, it is very relevant to the performance
   comparison addressed in this draft and based on that it was
   considered.  Other more complicated scenarios may happen which
   involve the retransmission of the AAA message between the FA and its
   local/home AAA server in addition to the MIPv4 registration request
   retransmission.  However, these other scenarios are either common to
   both MIPv4 AAA models or their impacts are already covered by the
   above scenarios.


5.  Performance Requirements and Assumptions

   The following bullets capture the base general assumptions and
   requirements for this performance comparison and analysis.

   o  The scenarios listed under section 3 of this document will be used
      as a base for this performance comparison.

   o  FA-AAA Round Trip: Is defined as the round trip between the FA and
      the home AAA server using a RADIUS or Diameter MIPv4 Application
      based AAA protocol.

Internet-Draft  MIP4 AAA Performance: RADIUS vs. Diameter      June 2007


   o  HA-AAA-RADIUS Round Trip: Is defined as the round trip between the
      HA and the home AAA server using a RADIUS based AAA protocol.

   o  AAA-HA-DIAMETER Round Trip: Is defined as the round trip between
      the home AAA server and the HA using Diameter MIPv4 Application
      based AAA protocol.

   o  The cost of a RADIUS based FA-AAA-RADIUS round trip is equal to
      the Diameter MIPv4 Application based FA-AAA-DIAMETER round trip.

   o  The cost of a RADIUS HA-AAA round trip is equal to a Diameter
      MIPv4 Application AAA-HA round trip.

   o  Only successful authentication and authorization scenarios are
      considered.  However, due to some network condition, a delay
      causes the MN not to receive the initial MIPv4 RRP message on time
      which forces the MN to retransmit the initial RRQ message.

   o  All network setup and geographical location of the different MIP
      agents/ entities and AAA infrastructure are exactly the same in
      both cases.

   o  In the case of HA-AAA RADIUS interface, if the HA receives a
      retransmitted RRQ while waiting for home AAA server response or
      after receiving a home AAA server response, the HA is able to
      cache the MN-HA SA parameters and MIPv4 user service authorization
      based on the home AAA server response in connection with the
      initial RRQ.  In this case, the HA is not required to contact the
      home AAA again for the retransmitted RRQ.



6.  RADIUS Based Model Performance

   In the RADIUS model, FA uses RADIUS AAA protocol to build an access
   request message, using related information from the MIPv4 initial
   RRQ, and by contacting the local AAA server to facilitate the
   authentication and authorization of the MIPv4 user through the user
   home AAA server.  This process involves a single round trip RADIUS
   messages, access request and access accept or access reject in the
   case of failure, between the FA and the AAA server (local/home).  In
   this model, home AAA server is not required to communicate with the
   HA while the FA is waiting for the AAA server response.

   On the other hand, the HA MAY communicate with the home AAA server
   only after the MIPv4 user is successfully authenticated and
   authorized by the home AAA and consequently the FA has relayed the
   initial RRQ and the HA has received it.  In the case when the HA does



Muhanna & Khalil        Expires December 30, 2007               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  MIP4 AAA Performance: RADIUS vs. Diameter      June 2007


   not have the MN-HA security association parameters available, e.g.
   MN-HA secret key, or MIPv4 service authorization requires the home
   AAA server approval, the HA builds and sends a RADIUS access request
   based on the MIPv4 user identity and the RRQ information to the home
   AAA.  This RADIUS access request is used to request the MN-HA SA
   parameters and the user MIPv4 service authorization in order to
   enable the HA to validate the MIPv4 RRQ and offer the MIPv4 mobility
   service.  The cost of such process is one HA-AAA round trip.

   In general, after the user is authenticated and authorized at the FA
   by the home AAA server and the FA is waiting for a response from the
   user HA, the FA MAY relay any retransmitted RRQ directly to the HA
   without the need to contact the home AAA server.  In this case, the
   FA depends on the HA to authenticate and authorize the retransmitted
   RRQ.

6.1.  RADIUS Based Model Handling of Scenario No. 1

   In this scenario and since the FA is in the waiting state to home AAA
   response, FA contacts the home AAA server similar to the initial RRQ.
   The FA builds a RADIUS access accept message and send it to the local
   AAA server exactly similar to its handling of the initial RRQ.

   This scenario adds a cost of an extra FA-AAA round trip to initial
   the call setup.

6.2.  RADIUS Based Model Handling of Scenario No. 2

   In this scenario and since the FA has received the successful home
   AAA server response, the FA , based on local policy, relays the
   retransmitted RRQ after the initial RRQ without contacting the home
   AAA server for retransmitted RRQ authentication and authorization.

   This scenario adds a cost of ZERO FA-AAA round trip to the initial
   call setup.  Figure 3 shows an example of how RADIUS based AAA model
   handles a retransmitted initial MIPv4 RRQ.

6.3.  RADIUS Based Model Handling of Scenario No. 3

   This scenario is similar to scenario No. 2 and the FA, based on local
   policy, relays the retransmitted RRQ to the HA without contacting the
   home AAA server to authenticate and authorize the user based on the
   MIPv4 retransmitted RRQ.

   This scenario adds a cost of ZERO FA-AAA round trip to the initial
   call setup.

6.4.  RADIUS Based Model Handling of Scenario No. 4

   In this scenario and since the FA has received the successful home
   AAA server response and a successful RRP from the HA, the FA relays
   the retransmitted RRQ to the HA without contacting the home AAA
   server to authenticate and authorize the user based on the
   retransmitted RRQ.

   This scenario adds a cost of ZERO FA-AAA round trip to the initial
   call setup.

7.  Diameter MIPv4 Application Based Model Performance

   In the Diameter MIPv4 Application AAA protocol model, FA uses
   Diameter MIPv4 application AAA protocol to build an AMR message,
   using related information from the MIPv4 initial RRQ, and by
   contacting the local AAA server to facilitate the authentication and
   authorization of the MIPv4 user through the user home AAA server.
   After the home AAA server receives the AMR message, home AAA server
   allocate the proper HA, statically or dynamically, and after
   authenticating the MIPv4 RRQ based on MN-AAA authentication
   extension, home AAA server builds HAR and sends it to the HA.  The
   HAR includes necessary MN-HA SA parameters, e.g.  MN-HA secret key,
   and possibly the HA-FA SA parameters, e.g.  FA-HA secret key and
   FA-HA SPI.

   After the HA receives the HAR, it extracts the MN-HA SA parameters to
   build the MN-HA AE and then build a MIPv4 RRP that is then mapped to
   the proper attributes of the HAA.  HA sends the HAA back to the home
   AAA server for the home AAA server to build a AMA and communicate
   back to the FA through the local AAA server.

   This process always involves a single FA-AAA-DIAMETER round trip and
   AAA-HA-DIAMETER round trip.  In this model, home AAA server is always
   required to communicate with the HA while the FA is waiting for the
   home AAA server response which is dependent on the HA to successfully
   process the HAR and build the RRP and send the HAA back to the home
   AAA server.

   In general, after the user is authenticated and authorized at the FA
   by the home AAA server and the FA receives a retransmitted RRQ, the
   FA has no other choice other than contacting the home AAA server via
   the local AAA server.  In this case, contacting the home AAA server
   always add one FA-AAA-DIAMETER and one AAA-HA-DIAMETER round trips.

7.1.  Diameter MIPv4 Model Handling of Scenario No. 1

   In this scenario and since the FA is in the waiting state for the
   home AAA response, FA contacts the home AAA server similar to the
   initial RRQ.  The FA builds an AMR message and send it to the local
   AAA server exactly similar to its handling of the initial RRQ.

   This scenario adds a cost of one FA-AAA-DIAMETER and one AAA-HA-
   DIAMETER round trips to the initial call setup.

7.2.  Diameter MIPv4 Model Handling of Scenarios 2 and 3

   In the case of Diameter MIPv4 application model, both scenarios No. 2
   and 3 mean one single scenario since the FA does not communicate the

   initial RRQ nor the retransmitted one directly to the HA.  In both of
   these scenarios, the FA is required to contact the home AAA server
   similar to the initial RRQ.  The FA builds an AMR message and send it
   to the local AAA server exactly similar to its handling of the
   initial RRQ.

   In each of these two scenarios, Diameter MIPv4 application model adds
   a cost of one FA-AAA-DIAMETER and one AAA-HA-DIAMETER round trips to
   the initial call setup.

7.3.  Diameter MIPv4 Model Handling of Scenario No. 4

   In this scenario and since the FA has received the successful home
   AAA server response which includes a successful RRP from the HA, the
   FA is still required to contact the home AAA server similar to the
   initial RRQ.  The FA builds an AMR message and send it to the local
   AAA server exactly similar to its handling of the initial RRQ.

   In this scenario, the Diameter MIPv4 application model adds a cost of
   one FA-AAA-DIAMETER and one AAA-HA-DIAMETER round trips to the
   initial call setup.


8.  Summary and Conclusions

   In summary, the Diameter Mobile IPv4 Application model uses the AAA
   infrastructure exclusively for the mobile IPv4 initial session setup.
   This means that initial RRQ and RRP are always transmitted via
   Diameter Mobile IPv4 Application attributes and messages, e.g.  AMR,
   AMA, HAR, and HAA.  In the case when the mobile node is required to
   retransmit the initial RRQ, Diameter Mmobile IPv4 application
   [RFC4004] model requires repeating all of the initial registration
   process over the AAA infrastructure one more time.  This mechanism is
   very expensive and causes a heavy burden on the AAA infrastructure.
   According to this study, the Diameter mobile IPv4 application model
   adds one FA-AAA-DIAMETER and one AAA-HA-DIAMETER round trips in all
   of the examined four scenarios.  However, RADIUS based model adds
   only one FA-AAA-RADIUS round trip for scenario No. 1 and none in all
   of the other examined scenarios.  Table 1 captures the summary of the
   findings of this study with respect to Diameter and RADIUS based
   models performance.

   In conclusion, since RADIUS protocol has some limitation in
   comparison to Diameter, it is highly recommended to have an
   Authentication and Authorization AAA application based on Diameter
   using a model similar to the concept of RADIUS based mechanism.  In
   such application, both advantages of Diameter protocol and RADIUS
   based mechanism could be achieved with the best possible performance.
