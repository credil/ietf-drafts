Internet-Draft            GSS IANA Instructions            February 2008


1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   There is a need for generic and mechanism-specific extensions to the
   Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-
   API).  As such extensions are designed and standardized, both at the
   IETF and elsewhere, there is a non-trivial risk of namespace
   pollution and conflicts.  To avoid this we set out guidelines for
   extending the GSS-API and create IANA registries of GSS-API
   namespaces.

   Registrations of individual items and sub-namespaces are allowed.
   Each sub-namespace may provide different rules for registration,
   e.g., for mechanism-specific and private-use extensions.  All
   Standards-Track uses of the GSS-API namespaces will be registered
   directly with the IANA subsequent to the create of the registries or
   when the document is published.


3.  Extensions to the GSS-API

   Extensions to the GSS-API can be categorized as follows:
   o  Abstract API extensions
   o  Implementation-specific
   o  Mechanism-specific
   o  Language binding-specific

   Extensions to the GSS-API may be purely semantic, without effect on
   the GSS-API's namespaces.  Or they may introduce new functions,
   constants, types, etc...; these clearly affect the GSS-API
   namespaces.

   Extensions that affect the GSS-API namespaces should be registered
   with the IANA as described herein.


4.  Generic GSS-API Namespaces

   The abstract API namespaces for the GSS-API are:
   o  Type names
   o  Function names
   o  Constant names for each type



Williams                 Expires August 28, 2008                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            GSS IANA Instructions            February 2008


   o  Constant values for each type
   o  Name types (OID, type name and syntaxes)

   Additionally we have namespaces associates with the OBJECT IDENTIFIER
   (OID) type:
   o  Mechanism OIDs
   o  Name Type OIDs


5.  Language Binding-Specific GSS-API Namespaces

   Language binding specific namespaces include:
   o  Header/interface module names
   o  Object classes and/or types
   o  Methods and/or functions
   o  Constant names
   o  Constant values


6.  Extension-Specific GSS-API Namespaces

   Extensions to the GSS-API may create additional namespaces.
   Instructions to the IANA should included for the handling of such
   namespaces.


7.  Registration Form(s)

   Registrations for GSS-API namespaces SHALL take the following form:

   |                |                            | or constant value   |
   |                |                            | range.              |

   The IANA should create a single GSS-API namespace registry, or
   multiple registries, one for symbolic names and one for constant
   values, or it may create a registry per-programming language, at its
   convenience.

   Entries in these registries should consist of all the fields from
   their corresponding registration entries.

   Entries should be sorted by object type, progamming language, symbol
   name.

   <Add text on guidelines for IANA consideration of registration
   applications, particularly with respect to entries lacking normative
   references, "magic" entries (e.g., special values of 'time' types
   which indicate something other than absolute or relative time, such
   as GSS_C_INDEFINITE), expert review requirements (if any) for
   registrations lacking normative references, etc....>


8.  Initial Namespace Registrations

   <Add registration entries for namespaces (name prefixes) for RFC2743/
   RFC2744/RFC2853.>

   <Add registration entries for private namespaces (name prefixes) for
   implementation- and/or platform-specific extensions.>


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document deals with IANA considerations throughout.
   Specifically it creates a single registry of various kinds of things,
   thought the IANA may instead create multiple registries each for one
   of those kinds of things.  Of particular interest may be that IANA

   will now be the registration authority for the GSS-API name type OID
   space.
