INTERNET DRAFT    Reauthentication Extension for IKEv2  January 12, 2011


Abstract

   This document describes an extension to the Internet Key Exchange
   version 2 (IKEv2) protocol that allows an IKEv2 Security Association
   (SA) to be reauthenticated without creating a new IKE SA or new Child
   SAs.

1. Introduction

   IKE SA reauthentication as defined in [IKEv2] is accomplished by
   creating a new IKE SA, creating new Child SAs, and deleting the old
   IKE SA.  Assuming that the old IKE SA has n Child SAs,
   reauthentication as defined in [IKEv2] requires at least n+1 message
   exchanges.  This style of reauthentication does not scale well when n
   is large.  The extension described in this document allows
   reauthentication of an IKE SA using a single IKE_AUTH exchange on the
   IKE SA to be reauthenticated without creating a new IKE SA or new
   Child SAs.  The terms IKEv2, IKEv2 SA, and Child SA and the various
   IKEv2 exchanges are defined in [IKEv2]

   Other problems with IKE SA reauthentication as defined in [IKEv2]
   include:

      o  Simultaneous IKE SA reauthentication may result in redundant
   SAs.

      o  Child SAs for which an internal address was assigned using the
   Configuration Payload may experience a connection disruption for
   reassignment of an internal address.

      o  While [IKEv2] describes how to handle exchange collisions that
   may occur during IKE SA rekeying, it does not do so for exchange
   collisions that may occur during reauthentication which could inhibit
   interoperability in such cases.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Protocol Outline

   The decision of whether or not to support an IKE_AUTH exchange
   without creating a new IKE SA is ultimately up to the responder.  A
   supporting responder MUST include the Notify payload, described in
   Section 3, within the IKE_SA_INIT response.

   After the initial exchanges, a supporting initiator MAY send the
   modified IKE_AUTH request, described in Section 4, if the
   notification was included in the IKE_SA_INIT response.  The initiator
   MUST NOT send the modified IKE_AUTH request if the notification was
   not present in the IKE_SA_INIT response.  

   A supporting responder that has advertised support by including the
   notification in the IKE_SA_INIT response MUST process a modified
   IKE_AUTH request, and MUST reply with a modified IKE_AUTH response. 
   Such a responder MUST NOT reply with a modified IKE_AUTH response if
   the initiator did not send a modified IKE_AUTH request.

   A supporting responder that has been configured not to support this
   extension to the protocol MUST behave as the same as if it didn't
   support this extension.  It MUST NOT advertise the capability with a
   notification, and it SHOULD reply with an INVALID_SYNTAX Notify
   payload if the client sends an IKE_AUTH request that is modified as
   described in Section 4.

3. REAUTH_SA Notification

   The Notify payload is as described in [IKEv2]
                            1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      ! Next Payload  !C!  RESERVED   !         Payload Length        !
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      !  Protocol ID  !   SPI Size    ! Reauthenticate SA Notify Type !
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      o  Protocol ID (1 octet) MUST be 1, as this message is related to
   an IKEv2 SA.

      o  SPI Size (1 octet) MUST be zero, in conformance with section
   3.10 of [IKEv2].

      o  Reauthenticate SA Notify Type (2 octets) - MUST be {TBA}, the
   value assigned for REAUTH_SA.

4. Modified IKE_AUTH Exchange for Reauthenticating the IKE SA

   [RFC6023] Section 5 describes a modified IKE_AUTH exchange for
   creating a childless IKE SA.  The modified IKE_AUTH exchange for
   reauthenticating the IKE SA is the same as that except for the
   following differences:

      o It MUST NOT be used during the initial exchanges.  In other
   words, the Message ID in the IKE headers of the modified IKE_AUTH
   exchange MUST be greater than 1.

      o It MUST be sent on the IKE SA to be reauthenticated.  In other
   words, the SPIs in the IKE headers of the modified IKE_AUTH exchange
   MUST be the same as the as the SPIs of the IKE SA to be
   reauthenticated.

      o The reauthenticated IKE SA retains all of the Child SAs it had
   prior to the modified IKE_AUTH exchange.

      o When not using extensible authentication (see [IKEv2] Section
   2.16), the Authentications payloads are generated as specified in
   Section 5.

5. Authentication Payload for Reauthenticating the IKE SA

   When not using extensible authentication, the peers are authenticated
   by having each sign (or MAC using a padded shared secret as the key,
   as described later in this section) a block of data.  The octets to

   be signed for the modified IKE_AUTH exchange are different than those
   described in [IKEv2] Section 2.15.  For the modified IKE_AUTH
   request, the octets to be signed start with the first octet of the
   previous Authentication payload sent by the initiator and end with
   the last octet of that payload.  For the modified IKE_AUTH response,
   the octets to be signed start with the first octet of the previous
   Authentication payload sent by the responder and end with the last
   octet of that payload.

6. Acknowledgements

   Martin Willi should be credited with being the first to document the
   problems with IKEv2 reauthentication and propose an extension to fix
   it.  David Wierbowski provided the initial nudge of encouragement for
   producing the first version of this document and provided many
   helpful comments, as did Scott Moonen.  Yoav Nir suggested the
   essential feature of sending the modified IKE_AUTH exchange on the
   IKE SA to be reauthenticated.

7. Security Considerations

   This protocol variation inherits all the security properties of
   regular IKEv2 as described in [IKEv2].

   The new notification carried in the initial exchange advertises the
   capability, and cannot be forged or added by an adversary without
   being detected, because the response to the initial exchange is
   authenticated with the AUTH payload of the IKE_AUTH exchange.  


8. IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a notify message type from the "IKEv2 Notify
   Message Types" registry with the name "REAUTH_SA" and the value
   {TBA}.
