Abstract

   This document specifies a revision of all Enumservices that have been
   registered at IANA under the nowadays obsolete regime of [RFC3761].
   It mainly adds the new fields to the IANA Registration Template as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide], and makes at the
   same time some corrections of editorial nature.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide] has obsoleted the IANA
   registration section of [RFC3761].  In the IANA registry for
   Enumservices, there are several entries that had been made under RFC
   3761 regime.  Those do not conform to the new guidelines as specified
   in [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].  To ensure consisteny among
   the Enumservice registrations, the document adds the new fields to
   the existing IANA registrations and make some editorial corrections
   at the same time.

   However, this document does only add the missing fields from the IANA
   Registration Template as spcified in the IANA cConsiderations of
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide], but does complete the (nowadays)
   missing sections of the corresponding Registration Documents.  These
   documents have to be revised in order to conform with the new regime
   for Enumservice registrations as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].

   This document updates the following RFCs:

   o  [RFC3762]
   o  [RFC3764]
   o  [RFC3953]
   o  [RFC4143]
   o  [RFC4002]
   o  [RFC4238]
   o  [RFC4355]
   o  [RFC4415]
   o  [RFC4769]
   o  [RFC4969]
   o  [RFC4979]
   o  [RFC5028]
   o  [I-D.ietf-enum-calendar-service]


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

      *  This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified by the
         associated URI scheme is capable of receiving a message using

      *  MMS messages are sent over SMTP using the format specified by
         TS 23.140 [15] Section 8.4.4 and TS 26.140 [16] Section 4.
      *  Within and between MMS Environments (MMSE, network
         infrastructures that support the MultiMedia Service), other
         pieces of state data (for example, charging-significant
         information) are exchanged between MMS Relay Servers.  Thus,
         although these servers use SMTP as the "bearer" for their
         application exchanges, they map their internal state to
         specialised headers carried in the SMTP message exchanges.  The
         headers used in such MMSE are described in detail in [17].

   o  Further Information:
      *  The MMS Architecture describes an interface between the MMSE
         and "legacy messaging systems" (labelled as MM3) which accepts
         "standard" SMTP messages.  Thus although the MMS Relay Server
         that supports this interface appears as a standard SMTP server
         from the perspective of an Internet-based mail server, it acts
         as a gateway and translator, adding the internal state data
         that is used within and between the MMS Environments.  This
         mechanism is described in [17], which also includes references
         to the specifications agreed by those bodies responsible for
         the design of the MMS.

      *  Note that MMS can be used as an alternative to deliver an SMS
         RP- DATA RPDU if, for example, the SMS bearer is not supported.
         If an entry includes this Enumservice, then in effect this can
         be taken as implying that the recipient is capable of receiving
         EMS or SMS messages at this address.  Such choices on the end
         system de do have two small caveats; whilst in practice all
         terminals supporting MMS today support SMS as well, it might
         not necessarily be the case in the future, and there may be
         tariff differences in using the MMS rather than using the SMS
         or EMS.

   o  Enumservice Subtype: N/A
   o  URI Scheme(s): 'http', 'https'
   o  Functional Specification:
      *  This Enumservice indicates that the resource dentified is a
         plain vCard, according to RFC2426, which may be accessed using
         HTTP / HTTPS [7].
      *  Clients fetching the vCard from the resource indicated should
         expect access to be restricted.  Additionally, the
         comprehension of the data provided may vary depending on the
         client's identity.

   o  Functional Specification:
      *  The kind of communication indicated by this Enumservice is
         "Interactive Voice".  From a protocol perspective, this
         communication is expected to involve bidirectional media
         streams carrying audio data.
      *  A client may imply that the person controlling population of a
         NAPTR holding this Enumservice indicates their capability to
         engage in an interactive voice session when contacted using the
         URI generated by this NAPTR.
   o  Security Considerations: See Section 5 of [RFC4415]
   o  Intended Usage: COMMON
   o  Registration Document(s):
      *  [RFC4415] (Updated by RFCTHIS)
      *  [RFCTHIS]
   o  Author(s): Rudolf Brandner, Lawrence Conroy, Richard Stastny
   o  Further Information:
      *  This Enumservice indicates that the person responsible for the
         NAPTR is accessible via the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone
         Network) or PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) using the value
         of the generated URI.
      *  The kind of subsystem required to initiate a Voice Enumservice
         with this Subtype is a "Dialler".  This is a subsystem that
         either provides a local connection to the PSTN or PLMN, or that
         provides an indirect connection to those networks.  The
         subsystem will use the telephone number held in the generated
         URI to place a voice call.  The voice call is placed to a
         network that uses E.164 numbers to route calls to an
         appropriate destination.
      *  Note that the PSTN/PLMN connection may be indirect.  The end
         user receiving this NAPTR may have a relationship with a
         Communications Service Provider that accepts call initiation
         requests from that subsystem using an IP-based protocol such as
         SIP or H.323, and places the call to the PSTN using a remote
         gateway service.  In this case the Provider may either accept
         requests using "tel:" URIs or has a defined mechanism to
         convert "tel:" URI values into a "protocol-native" form.
      *  The "tel:" URI value SHOULD be fully qualified (using the
         "global phone number" form of RFC3966 [10]).  A "local phone
         number" as defined in that document SHOULD NOT be used unless
         the controller of the zone in which the NAPTR appears is sure
         that it can be distinguished unambiguously by all clients that
         can access the resource record and that a call from their
         network access points can be routed to that destination.

   o  Functional Specification: See Sections 3.2 - 3.3 of [RFC4238]
   o  Security Considerations:
      *  Malicious Redirection:
         One of the fundamental dangers related to any service such as
         this is that a malicious entry in a resolver's database will
         cause clients to resolve the E.164 into the wrong LDAP URL.
         The possible intent may be to cause the client to connect to a
         rogue LDAP server and retrieve (or fail to retrieve) a resource
         containing fraudulent or damaging information.
      *  Denial of Service:
         By removing the URL to which the E.164 maps, a malicious
         intruder may remove the client's ability to access the LDAP
         directory server.

   o  Functional Specification: See Sections 4.2 - 4.4 of [RFC4238]
   o  Security Considerations:
      *  Malicious Redirection:
         One of the fundamental dangers related to any service such as
         this is that a malicious entry in a resolver's database will
         cause clients to resolve the E.164 into the wrong email URL.
         The possible intent may be to cause the client to send the
         information to an incorrect destination.
      *  Denial of Service:
         By removing the URL to which the E.164 maps, a malicious
         intruder may remove the client's ability to access the
         resource.
      *  Unsolicited Bulk Email:
         The exposure of email addresses through the ENUM service
         provides a bulk mailer access to large numbers of email
         addresses where only the telephone number was previously known.

         information.  It has to be noted that the kind of information
         retrieved can be manifold.  Usually, contacting a resource by
         an "http:" URI provides a document.  This document can contain

         of information, like audio or video or executable code.  Thus,
