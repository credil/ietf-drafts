                 Session Peering Provisioning Protocol
                      draft-ietf-drinks-spprov-10

Abstract

   This document defines a protocol for provisioning session
   establishment data into Session Data Registries and SIP Service
   Provider data stores.  The provisioned data is typically used by
   various network elements for session peering.

   This document describes the Session Peering Provisioning Protocol
   used by clients to provision registries.  The document provides a set
   of guiding principles for the design of this protocol including
   extensibility and independent transport definitions, a basic data
   model and an XML Schema Document.

1.  Introduction

   Service providers and enterprises use registries to make session
   routing decisions for Voice over IP, SMS and MMS traffic exchanges.
   This document is narrowly focused on the provisioning protocol for
   these registries.  This protocol prescribes a way for an entity to
   provision session-related data into a registry.  The data being
   provisioned can be optionally shared with other participating peering
   entities.  The requirements and use cases driving this protocol have
   been documented in [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements].  The
   reader is expected to be familiar with the terminology defined in the
   previously mentioned document.

   Three types of provisioning flows have been described in the use case
   document: client to registry provisioning, registry to local data
   repository and registry to registry.  This document addresses client
   to registry aspect to fulfill the need to provision Session
   Establishment Data (SED).  The protocol that supports flow of
   messages to facilitate client to registry provisioning is referred to
   as Session Peering Provisioning Protocol (SPPP).

   Please note that the role of the "client" and the "server" only
   applies to the connection, and those roles are not related in any way
   to the type of entity that participates in a protocol exchange.  For
   example, a registry might also include a "client" when such a
   registry initiates a connection (for example, for data distribution
   to SSP).

                     Three Registry Provisioning Flows

                                 Figure 1

   The data provisioned for session establishment is typically used by
   various downstream SIP signaling systems to route a call to the next
   hop associated with the called domain.  These systems typically use a
   local data store ("Local Data Repository") as their source of session
   routing information.  More specifically, the SED data is the set of
   parameters that the outgoing signaling path border elements (SBEs)
   need to initiate the session.  See [RFC5486] for more details.

   A "terminating" SIP Service Provider (SSP) provisions SED into the
   registry to be selectively shared with other peer SSPs.
   Subsequently, a registry may distribute the provisioned data into
   local data repositories used for look-up queries (identifier -> URI)
   or for lookup and location resolution (identifier -> URI -> ingress
   SBE of terminating SSP).  In some cases, the registry may
   additionally offer a central query resolution service (not shown in
   the above figure).

   A key requirement for the SPPP protocol is to be able to accommodate
   two basic deployment scenarios:

   1.  A resolution system returns a Look-Up Function (LUF) that
       comprises of the target domain to assist in call routing (as
       described in [RFC5486]).  In this case, the querying entity may

       use other means to perform the Location Routing Function (LRF)
       which in turn helps determine the actual location of the
       Signaling Function in that domain.

   2.  A resolution system returns both a Look-Up function (LUF) and
       Location Routing Function (LRF) to locate the SED data fully.

   In terms of protocol design, SPPP is agnostic to the transport.  This
   document includes the description of the data model and the means to
   enable protocol operations within a request and response structure.
   To encourage interoperability, the protocol supports extensibility
   aspects.

   Transport requirements are provided in this document to help with the
   selection of the optimum transport mechanism.
   ([I-D.ietf-drinks-sppp-over-soap]) identifies a SOAP transport
   mechanism for SPPP.

   This document is organized as follows:

   o    Section 2 provides the terminology;

   o    Section 3 provides an overview of the SPPP, including the
        layering approach, functional entities and data model;

   o    Section 4 specifies requirements for SPPP transport protocols;

   o    Section 5 describes the base protocol data structures including
        the request and response elements (Section 5.1), the response
        codes and messages (Section 5.2) and the basic object type most
        first class objects extend from;

   o    Section 6 and Section 7 describe the main protocol commands and
        examples;

   o    Section 8 defines XML considerations that XML parsers must meet
        to conform to this specification;

   o    Section 11 normatively defines the SPPP protocol using its XML
        Schema Definition.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document reuses terms from [RFC3261], [RFC5486], use cases and
   requirements documented in [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements]
   and the ENUM Validation Architecture [RFC4725].

   In addition, this document specifies the following additional terms:


   SPPP:   Session Peering Provisioning Protocol, the protocol used to
      provision data into a Registry (see arrow labeled "1." in Figure 1
      of [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements]).  It is the primary
      scope of this document.


   SPDP:   Session Peering Distribution Protocol, the protocol used to
      distribute data to Local Data Repository (see arrow labeled "2."
      in Figure 1 of [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements]).


   Client:   An application that supports an SPPP client; it is
      sometimes referred to as a "registry client".


   Registry:   The Registry operates a master database of Session
      Establishment Data for one or more Registrants.

      A Registry acts as an SPPP server.


   Registrant:   In this document we extend the definition of a
      Registrant based on [RFC4725].  The Registrant is the end-user,
      the person or organization that is the "holder" of the Session
      Establishment Data being provisioned into the Registry by a
      Registrar.  For example, in
      [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements], a Registrant is pictured
      as a SIP Service Provider in Figure 2.

      Within the confines of a Registry, a Registrant is uniquely
      identified by a well-known ID.

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov            September 2011


   Registrar:   In this document we extend the definition of a Registrar
      from [RFC4725].  A Registrar is an entity that performs
      provisioning operations on behalf of a Registrant by interacting
      with the Registry via SPPP operations.  In other words the
      Registrar is the SPPP Client.  The Registrar and Registrant roles
      are logically separate to allow, but not require, a single
      Registrar to perform provisioning operations on behalf of more
      than one Registrant.

   Peering Organization:   A Peering Organization is an entity to which
      a Registrant's Route Groups are made visible using the operations
      of SPPP.

3.  Protocol High Level Design

   This section introduces the structure of the data model and provides
   the information framework for the SPPP.  An overview of the protocol
   operations is first provided with a typical deployment scenario.  The
   data model is then defined along with all the objects manipulated by
   the protocol and their relationships.

3.1.  Protocol Layering

   SPPP is a simple request/reply protocol that allows a client
   application to submit provisioning data and query requests to a
   server.  The SPPP data structures are designed to be protocol
   agnostic.  Concerns regarding encryption, non-repudiation, and
   authentication are beyond the scope of this document.  For more
   details, please refer to the Transport Protocol Requirements section.

   SPPP can be viewed as a set of layers that collectively define the
   structure of an SPPP request and response.  Layers 1 and 2, as
   detailed below, are left to separate specifications to allow for
   potentially multiple SPPP transport, envelope, and authentication
   technologies.  This document defines layers 3, 4, and 5 below.

   1.  The transport protocol layer provides a communication mechanism
       between the client and server.  SPPP can be layered over any
       transport protocol that provides a set of basic requirements
       defined in the Transport Protocol Requirements section.

   2.  The message envelope layer is optional, but can provide features
       that are above the transport technology layer but below the
       application messaging layer.  Technologies such as HTTP and SOAP
       are examples of messaging envelope technologies.

   3.  The message layer provides a simple, envelope-independent and
       transport-independent, SPPP wrapper for SPPP request and response
       messages.

   4.  The operation layer defines the set of base SPPP actions that can
       be invoked for a given object data type using an SPPP message.
       Operations are encoded using XML encoded actions and objects.

   5.  The data object layer defines the base set of SPPP data objects
       that can be included in update operations or returned in
       operation responses.

3.2.  Protocol Data Model

   The data model illustrated and described in Figure 3 defines the
   logical objects and the relationships between these objects that the
   SPPP protocol supports.  SPPP defines the protocol operations through
   which an SPPP client populates a registry with these logical objects.
   Various clients belonging to different registrars may use the
   protocol for populating the registry's data.

   The logical structure presented below is consistent with the
   terminology and requirements defined in
   [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements].

   The objects and attributes that comprise the data model can be
   described as follows (objects listed from the bottom up):

   o  Public Identifier:
      From a broad perspective a public identifier is a well-known
      attribute that is used as the key to perform resolution lookups.
      Within the context of SPPP, a public identifier object can be a
      telephone number, a range of telephone numbers, a PSTN Routing
      Number (RN), or a TN prefix.

      An SPPP Public Identifier is associated with a Destination Group
      to create a logical grouping of Public Identifiers that share a
      common set of Routes.

      A TN Public Identifier may optionally be associated with zero or
      more individual Route Records.  This ability for a Public
      Identifier to be directly associated with a set of Route Records
      (e.g. target URI), as opposed to being associated with a
      Destination Group, supports the use cases where the target URI
      contains data specifically tailored to an individual TN Public
      Identifier.

   o  Destination Group:
      A named collection of zero or more Public Identifiers that can be
      associated with one or more Route Groups for the purpose of
      facilitating the management of their common routing information.

   o  Route Group:
      A Route Group contains a set of Route Record references, a set of
      Destination Group references, and a set of peering organization
      identifiers.  This is used to establish a three part relationships
      between a set of Public Identifiers, the routing information (SED)
      shared across the Public Identifiers, and the list of peering
      organizations whose query responses from the resolution system may
      include the routing information from a given route group.  In
      addition, the sourceIdent element within a Route Group, in concert
      with the set of peering organization identifiers, enables fine-
      grained source based routing.  For further details about the Route
      Group and source based routing, refer to the definitions and
      descriptions of the Route Group operations found later in this
      document.

   o  Route Record:
      A Route Record contains the data that a resolution system returns
      in response to a successful query for a Public Identifier.  Route
      Records are generally associated with a Route Group when the SED
      within is not specific to a Public Identifier.
      To support the use cases defined in

      [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements], SPPP defines three type
      of Route Records: URIType, NAPTRType, and NSType.  These Route
      Records extend the abstract type RteRecType and inherit the common
      attribute 'priority' that is meant for setting precedence across
      the route records defined within a Route Group in a protocol
      agnostic fashion.

   o  Organization:
      An Organization is an entity that may fulfill the role of a
      registrant or a peering organization.  All SPPP objects are
      associated with an organization identifier to identify each
      object's registrant, while tracking the identity of the registrar
      that provisioned each SPPP object is left as a matter of policy
      for an SPPP implementation.  A Route Group object is also
      associated with a set of zero or more organization identifiers
      that identify the peering organization(s) whose resolution query
      responses may include the routing information (SED) defined in the
      Route Records within that Route Group.  A peering organization is
      an entity that the registrant intends to share the SED data with.
      A route group SPPP object is associated with a set of zero or more
      organization identifiers that identify the peering organizations
      whose resolution query responses may include the routing
      information (SED) defined in the route records within that route
      group.

3.3.  Time Value

   Some SPPP request and response messages include time value(s) defined
   as type xs:dateTime, a built-in W3C XML Schema Datatype.  Use of
   unqualified local time value is discouraged as it can lead to
   interoperability issues.  The value of time attribute MUST BE
   expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format without the
   timezone digits.

   "2010-05-30T09:30:10Z" is an example of an acceptable time value for
   use in SPPP messages. "2010-05-30T06:30:10+3:00" is a valid UTC time,
   but it is not approved for use in SPPP messages.

4.  Transport Protocol Requirements

   This section provides requirements for transport protocols suitable
   for SPPP.  More specifically, this section specifies the services,
   features, and assumptions that SPPP delegates to the chosen transport
   and envelope technologies.

4.1.  Connection Oriented

   The SPPP follows a model where a client establishes a connection to a
   server in order to further exchange SPPP messages over such point-to-
   point connection.  A transport protocol for SPPP MUST therefore be
   connection oriented.

4.2.  Request and Response Model

   Provisioning operations in SPPP follow the request-response model,
   where a client sends a request message to initiate a transaction and
   the server responds with a response.  Multiple subsequent request-
   response exchanges MAY be performed over a single persistent
   connection.

   Therefore, a transport protocol for SPPP MUST follow the request-
   response model by allowing a response to be sent to the request
   initiator.

4.3.  Connection Lifetime

   Some use cases involve provisioning a single request to a network
   element.  Connections supporting such provisioning requests might be
   short-lived, and may be established only on demand.  Other use cases
   involve either provisioning a large dataset, or a constant stream of
   small updates, either of which would likely require long-lived
   connections.

   Therefore, a protocol suitable for SPPP SHOULD be able to support
   both short-lived as well as long-lived connections.

4.4.  Authentication

   All SPPP objects are associated with a registrant identifier.  SPPP
   Clients provisions SPPP objects on behalf of registrants.  An
   authenticated SPP Client is a registrar.  Therefore, the SPPP
   transport protocol MUST provide means for an SPPP server to
   authenticate an SPPP Client.

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov            September 2011


4.5.  Authorization

   After successful authentication of the SPPP client as a registrar the
   registry performs authorization checks to determine if the registrar
   is authorized to act on behalf of the Registrant whose identifier is
   included in the SPPP request.  Refer to the Security Considerations
   section for further guidance.

4.6.  Confidentiality and Integrity

   In some deployments, the SPPP objects that an SPPP registry manages
   can be private in nature.  As a result it MAY NOT be appropriate to
   for transmission in plain text over a connection to the SPPP
   registry.  Therefore, the transport protocol SHOULD provide means for
   end-to-end encryption between the SPPP client and server.

   For some SPPP implementations, it may be acceptable for the data to
   be transmitted in plain text, but the failure to detect a change in
   data after it leaves the SPPP client and before it is received at the
   server, either by accident or with a malicious intent, will adversely
   affect the stability and integrity of the registry.  Therefore, the
   transport protocol SHOULD provide means for data integrity
   protection.

4.7.  Near Real Time

   Many use cases require near real-time responses from the server.
   Therefore, a DRINKS transport protocol MUST support near real-time
   response to requests submitted by the client.

4.8.  Request and Response Sizes

   Use of SPPP may involve simple updates that may consist of small
   number of bytes, such as, update of a single public identifier.
   Other provisioning operations may constitute large number of datasets
   as in adding millions records to a registry.  As a result, a suitable
   transport protocol for SPPP SHOULD accommodate datasets of various
   sizes.

4.9.  Request and Response Correlation

   A transport protocol suitable for SPPP MUST allow responses to be
   correlated with requests.

4.10.  Request Acknowledgement

   Data transported in the SPPP is likely crucial for the operation of
   the communication network that is being provisioned.  A SPPP client

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov            September 2011


   responsible for provisioning SED to the registry has a need to know
   if the submitted requests have been processed correctly.

   Failed transactions can lead to situations where a subset of public
   identifiers or even SSPs might not be reachable, or the provisioning
   state of the network is inconsistent.

   Therefore, a transport protocol for SPPP MUST provide a response for
   each request, so that a client can identify whether a request
   succeeded or failed.

4.11.  Mandatory Transport

   At the time of this writing, a choice of transport protocol has been
   provided in [I-D.ietf-drinks-sppp-over-soap].  To encourage
   interoperability, the SPPP server MUST provide support for this
   transport protocol.  With time, it is possible that other transport
   layer choices may surface that agree with the requirements discussed
   above.

5.  Base Protocol Data Structures

   SPPP uses a common model and a common set of data structures for most
   of the supported operations and object types.  This section describes
   these common data structures.

5.1.  Request and Response Structures

   An SPPP client interacts with an SPPP server by using one of the
   supported transport mechanisms to send one or more requests to the
   server and receive corresponding replies from the server.  There are
   two generalized types of operations that an SPPP client can submit to
   an SPPP server, updates and queries.  The following two sub-sections
   describe the generalized data structures that are used for each of
   these two types of operations.

5.1.1.  Update Request and Response Structures

   An SPPP update request is wrapped within the <spppUpdateRequest>
   element while an SPPP update response is wrapped within an
   <spppUpdateResponse> element.  The following two sub-sections
   describe these two elements.

5.1.1.1.  Update Request

   An SPPP update request object is contained within the generic
   <spppUpdateRequest> element.




     <element name="spppUpdateRequest">
       <complexType>
         <sequence>
           <element name="clientTransId" type="spppb:TransIdType"
                    minOccurs="0"/>
           <element name="minorVer" type="spppb:MinorVerType"
                    minOccurs="0"/>
           <element name="rqst" type="spppb:BasicUpdateRqstType"
                    maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
         </sequence>
       </complexType>
     </element>

     <simpleType name="TransIdType">
       <restriction base="string"/>
     </simpleType>

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov            September 2011


     <simpleType name="MinorVerType">
       <restriction base="unsignedLong"/>
     </simpleType>



   The data elements within the <spppUpdateRequest> element are
   described as follows:

   o    clientTransId: Zero or one client-generated transaction ID that,
        within the context of the SPPP client, identifies this request.
        This value can be used at the discretion of the SPPP client to
        track, log or correlate requests and their responses.  SPPP
        server MUST echo back this value to the client in the
        corresponding response to the incoming request.  SPPP server
        will not check this value for uniqueness.

   o    minorVer: Zero or one minor version identifier, indicating the
        minor version of the SPPP API that the client is attempting to
        use.  This is used in conjunction with the major version
        identifier in the XML namespace to identify the version of SPPP
        that the client is using.  If the element is not present, the
        server assumes that the client is using the latest minor version
        supported by the SPPP server for the given major version.  The
        versions supported by a given SPPP server can be retrieved by
        the client using the SPPP server menu operation described later
        in the document.

   o    rqst: One or more BasicUpdateRqstType objects.  These are the
        actions that the client is requesting the SPPP server perform.
        They are processed by the SPPP server in the order in which they
        are included in the request.  And with respect to handling error
        conditions, it is a matter of policy whether the objects are
        processed in a "stop and rollback" fashion or in a "stop and
        commit" fashion.  In the "stop and rollback" scenario, the SPPP
        server would stop processing BasicUpdateRqstType object
        instances in the request at the first error and roll back any
        BasicUpdateRqstType object instances that had already been
        processed for that update request.  In the "stop and commit"
        scenario the SPPP server would stop processing
        BasicUpdateRqstType object instances in the request at the first
        error but commit any BasicUpdateRqstType object instances that
        had already been processed for that update request.

   All update request objects extend the base type BasicUpdateRqstType.
   This base type is defined as follows:

       <sequence>
         <element name="ext" type="spppb:ExtAnyType" minOccurs="0"/>
       </sequence>
     </complexType>


   The BasicUpdateRqstType object primarily acts as an abstract base
   type, and its only data element is described as follows:

   o    ext: This is the standard extension element for this object.
        Refer to the Extensibility section of this document for more
        details.

5.1.1.2.  Update Response

   An SPPP update response object is contained within the generic
   <spppUpdateResponse> element.

      <sequence>
        <element name="overallResult" type="spppb:ResultCodeType"/>

   An <spppUpdateResponse> contains the elements necessary for the SPPP
   client to precisely determine the overall result of the request, and
   if an error occurred, it provides information about the specific
   object, data element, or condition caused the error.

   The data elements within the SPPP update response are described as
   follows:

   o    clientTransId: Zero or one client transaction ID.  This value is
        simply an echo of the client transaction ID that SPPP client
        passed into the SPPP update request.  When included in the
        request, the SPPP server MUST return it in the corresponding
        response message.

   o    serverTransId: Exactly one server transaction ID that identifies
        this request for tracking purposes.  This value MUST be unique
        for a given SPPP server.

   o    overallResult: Exactly one response code and message pair that
        explicitly identifies the result of the request.  See the
        Response Code section for further details.

   o    rqstObjResult: An optional response code, response message, and
        BasicRqstObject triplet.  This element will be present only if
        an object level error has occurred.  It indicates the error
        condition and the exact request object that contributed to the
        error.  The response code will reflect the exact error.  See the
        Response Code section for further details.

   o    ext: This is the standard extension element for this object.
        Refer to the Extensibility section for more details.

5.1.2.  Query Request and Response Structures

   At times, on behalf of the registrant, the registrar may need to have
   access to SPPP objects that were previously provisioned in the
   registry.  A few examples include logging, auditing, and pre-
   provisioning dependency checking.  This query mechanism is limited to
   aid provisioning scenarios and should not be confused with query
   protocols provided as part of the resolution system (e.g.  ENUM and
   SIP).

   An SPPP query request is wrapped within the <spppQueryRequest>

   element while an SPPP query response is wrapped within an
   <spppQueryResponse> element.  The following two sub-sections describe
   these two element structures.

5.1.2.1.  Query Request

   An SPPP query request object is contained within the generic
   <spppQueryRequest> element.



     <element name="spppQueryRequest">
       <complexType>
         <sequence>
           <element name="minorVer" type="spppb:MinorVerType"
               minOccurs="0"/>
           <element name="rqst" type="spppb:BasicQueryRqstType"/>
         </sequence>
       </complexType>
     </element>


   The data elements within the <spppQueryRequest> element are described
   as follows:

   o    minorVer: Zero or one minor version identifier, indicating the
        minor version of the SPPP API that the client is attempting to
        use.  This is used in conjunction with the major version
        identifier in the XML namespace to identify the version of SPPP
        that the client is using.  If the element is not present, the
        server assumes that the client is using the latest minor version
        supported by the SPPP server for the given major version.  The
        versions supported by a given SPPP server can be retrieved by
        the client using the SPPP server menu operation described later
        in the document.

   o    rqst: One BasicQueryRqstType objects.  This is the query that
        the client is requesting the SPPP server perform.

   All query request objects extend the base type BasicQueryRqstType.
   This base type is defined as follows:



     <complexType name="BasicQueryRqstType" abstract="true">
       <sequence>
         <element name="ext" type="spppb:ExtAnyType" minOccurs="0"/>
       </sequence>

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov            September 2011


     </complexType>


   The BasicQueryRqstType object primarily acts as an abstract base
   type, and its only data element is described as follows:

   o    ext: This is the standard extension element for this object.
        Refer to the Extensibility section of this document for more
        details.

5.1.2.2.  Query Response

   An SPPP query response object is contained within the generic
   <spppQueryResponse> element.



     <element name="spppQueryResponse">
       <complexType>
         <sequence>
           <element name="overallResult" type="spppb:ResultCodeType"/>
           <element name="resultSet" type="spppb:BasicObjType"
              minOccurs="0" maxOccurs=" unbounded"/>
         </sequence>
       </complexType>
     </element>


   An <spppQueryResponse> contains the elements necessary for the SPPP
   client to precisely determine the overall result of the query, and if
   an error occurred, exactly what condition caused the error.

   The data elements within the SPPP query response are described as
   follows:

   o    overallResult: Exactly one response code and message pair that
        explicitly identifies the result of the request.  See the
        Response Code section for further details.

   o    resultSet: The set of zero or more objects that matched the
        query criteria.  If no objects matched the query criteria then
        this result set MUST be empty and the overallResult value MUST
        indicate success (if no matches are found for the query
        criteria, the response is considered a success).

5.2.  Response Codes and Messages

   This section contains the listing of response codes and their
   corresponding human-readable text.

   The response code numbering scheme generally adheres to the theory
   formalized in section 4.2.1 of [RFC5321]:

   o    The first digit of the response code can only be 1 or 2: 1 = a
        positive result, 2 = a negative result.

   o    The second digit of the response code indicates the category: 0
        = Protocol Syntax, 1 = Implementation Specific Business Rule, 2
        = Security, 3 = Server System.

   o    The third and fourth digits of the response code indicate the
        individual message event within the category defines by the
        first two digits.

   The response codes are also categorized as to whether they are
   overall response codes that may only be returned in the
   "overallResult" data element in SPPP responses, of object level
   response codes that may only be returned in the "rqstObjResult"
   element of the SPPP responses.

           Table 1: Response Codes Numbering Scheme and Messages

   Each of the object level response messages are "parameterized" with
   the following parameters: "AttributeName" and "AttributeValue".

   The use of these parameters MUST adhere to the following rules:

   o    All parameters within a response message are mandatory and MUST
        be present.

   o    Any value provided for the "AttributeName" parameter MUST be an
        exact XSD element name of the protocol data element that the

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov            September 2011


        response message is referring to.  For example, valid values for
        "attribute name" are "dgName", "rgName", "rteRec", etc.

   o    The value for "AttributeValue" MUST be the value of the data
        element to which the preceding "AttributeName" refers.

   o    Result code 2104 SHOULD be used whenever an element value does
        not adhere to data validation rules.

   o    Result codes 2104 and 2105 MUST NOT be used interchangeably.
        Response code 2105 SHOULD be returned by an update operation
        when the data element(s) used to uniquely identify a pre-
        existing object do not exist.  If the data elements used to
        uniquely identify an object are malformed, then response code
        2104 SHOULD be returned.

5.3.  Basic Object Type and Organization Identifiers

   This section introduces the basic object type that most first class
   objects derive from.

   All first class objects extend the basic object type BasicObjType
   that contains the identifier of the registrant organization that owns
   this object, the date and time that the object was created by the
   server, and the date and time that the object was last modified.



     <complexType name="BasicObjType" abstract="true">
       <sequence>
         <element name="rant" type="spppb:OrgIdType"/>
         <element name="cDate" type="dateTime" minOccurs="0"/>
         <element name="mDate" type="dateTime" minOccurs="0"/>
         <element name="ext" type="spppb:ExtAnyType" minOccurs="0"/>
       </sequence>
     </complexType>



   The identifiers used for registrants (rant) and peering organizations
   (peeringOrg) are instances of OrgIdType.  The OrgIdType is defined as
   a string and all OrgIdType instances SHOULD follow the textual
   convention: "namespace:value" (for example "iana-en:32473").  See the
   IANA Consideration section for more details.

6.  Protocol Commands

   This section provides a description of each supported protocol
   command.

6.1.  Add Destination Group Operation

   As described in the introductory sections, a Destination Group
   represents a set of Public Identifiers with common routing
   information.

   The AddDestGrpRqstType operation creates or overwrites a Destination
   Group object.  If a Destination Group with the given name and
   registrant ID (which together comprise the unique key for a
   Destination Group) does not exist, then the server MUST create the
   Destination Group.  If a Destination Group with the given name and
   registrant ID does exist, then the server MUST replace the current
   properties of the Destination Group with the properties passed into
   the AddDestGrpsRqstType operation.  The XSD declarations of the
   operation request object are as follows:



     <complexType name="AddDestGrpRqstType">
       <complexContent>
         <extension base="spppb:BasicUpdateRqstType">
           <sequence>
             <element name="destGrp" type="spppb:DestGrpType"/>
           </sequence>
         </extension>
       </complexContent>
     </complexType>


   The element passed into the spppUpdateRequest element for this
   operation is an element of type AddDestGrpRqsttype, which extends
   BasicUpdateRqstType and contains a DestGrpType object.  The
   DestGrpType object structure is defined as follows:



     <complexType name="DestGrpType">
       <complexContent>
        <extension base="spppb:BasicObjType">
         <sequence>
            <element name="dgName" type="spppb:ObjNameType"/>
         </sequence>
        </extension>

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov            September 2011


       </complexContent>
     </complexType>


   The DestGrpType object is composed of the following elements:

   o    base: All first class objects extend BasicObjType that contains
        the ID of the registrant organization that owns this object, the
        date and time that the object was created by the server, and the
        date and time that the object was last modified.  If the client
        passed in either the created date or the modification date, the
        server will ignore them.  The server sets these two date/time
        values.

   o    dgName: The character string that contains the name of the
        Destination Group.  This uniquely identifies this object within
        the context of the registrant ID (a child element of the base
        element as described above).

   o    ext: Point of extensibility described in a previous section of
        this document.

   As with the responses to all update operations, the result of the
   AddDestGrpRqstType operation is contained in the generic
   spppUpdateResponse data structure described in an earlier sections of
   this document.  For a detailed description of the spppUpdateResponse
   data structure refer to that section of the document.

6.2.  Get Destination Groups Operation

   The getDestGrpsRqst operation allows an SPPP client to get the
   properties of Destination Group objects that a registrar is
   authorized to view on behalf of the registrant.  The server will
   attempt to find a Destination Group object that has the registrant ID
   and destination group name pair contained in each ObjKeyType object
   instance.  If there are no matching Destination Groups found then an
   empty result set will be returned.  If no ObjKeyType objects are
   found in the request then the server will return the list of all
   Destination Group objects in the registry.  If no matching records
   can be located then an empty result set will be returned.

   The element passed into the spppQueryRequest element for this
   operation is an instance of type GetDestGrpsRqstType, which extends
   BasicQueryRqstType and contains zero or more ObjKeyType objects.  Any
   limitation on the maximum number of objects that may be passed into
   or returned by this operation is a policy decision and not limited by
   the protocol.  The XSD declaration of the operation is as follows:

         <extension base="spppb:BasicQueryRqstType">

           </sequence>
         </extension>
       </complexContent>
     </complexType>


   As described in an earlier section of this document, the result of
   any spppQueryRequest operation is an spppQueryResponse element that
   contains the overall response code and the query result set, if any.
   Refer to that section of the document for a detailed description of
   the spppQueryResponse element.

6.3.  Add Public Identifier Operation

   A Public Identifier is the search key used for locating the session
   establishment data (SED).  In many cases, a Public Identifier is
   attributed to the end user who has a retail relationship with the
   service provider or registrant organization.  SPPP supports the
   notion of the carrier-of-record as defined in [RFC5067].  Therefore,
   the registrant under whom the Public Identity is being created can
   optionally claim to be a carrier-of-record.

   SPPP identifies two types of Public Identifiers: telephone numbers
   (TN), and the routing numbers (RN).  SPPP provides structures to
   manage a single TN, a contiguous range of TNs, and a TN prefix.

   The abstract XML schema type definition PubIDType is a generalization
   for the concrete the Public Identifier schema types.  PubIDType
   element 'dgName' represents the name of the destination group that a
   given Public Identifier is a member of.  Because a Destination Group
   is uniquely identified by its composite business key, which is
   comprised of its registrant ID, rantId, and its name, dgName, the
   Public Identity's containing Destination Group is identified by the
   Public Identity's dgName element and the Public Identity's registrant
   ID, rantId, element.  The PubIDType object structure is defined as
   follows:

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov            September 2011


  <complexType name="PubIdType" abstract="true">
    <complexContent>
     <extension base="spppb:BasicObjType">
       <sequence>
         <element name="dgName" type="spppb:ObjNameType" minOccurs="0"/>
       </sequence>
     </extension>
    </complexContent>
  </complexType>


   A registrant can add a Public Identifier using the AddPubIdRqstType
   operation.  To complete the add request, AddPubIdRqstType XML
   instance is populated into the <spppUpdateRequest> element.  A Public
   Identifier may be provisioned as a member of a Destination Group or
   provisioned outside of a Destination Group.  A Public Identifier that
   is provisioned as a member of a Destination Group is intended to be
   associated with its SED through the Route Group(s) that are
   associated with its containing Destination Group.  A Public
   Identifier that is not provisioned as a member of a Destination Group
   is intended to be associated with its SED through the Route Records
   that are directly associated with the Public Identifier.  If a Public
   Identifier being added already exists then that Public Identifier
   will be replaced with the newly provisioned Public Identifier.

   A telephone number is provisioned using the TNType, an extension of
   PubIDType.  Each TNType object is uniquely identified by the
   combination of its <tn> element, and the unique key of its parent
   Destination Group (dgName and rantId).  In other words a given
   telephone number string may exist within one or more Destination
   Groups, but must not exist more than once within a Destination Group.
   TNType is defined as follows:



     <complexType name="TNType">
       <complexContent>
         <extension base="spppb:PubIdType">
           <sequence>

   TNType consists of the following attributes:

   o    tn: Telephone number to be added to the registry.

   o    rrRef: Optional reference to route records that are directly
        associated with the TN Public Identifier.  Following the SPPP
        data model, the route record could be a protocol agnostic
        URIType or another type.

   o    corInfo: corInfo is an optional parameter of type CORInfoType
        that allows the registrant organization to set forth a claim to
        be the carrier-of-record (see [RFC5067]).  This is done by
        setting the value of <corClaim> element of the CORInfoType
        object structure to "true".  The other two parameters of the
        CORInfoType, <cor> and <corDate> are set by the registry to
        describe the outcome of the carrier-of-record claim by the
        registrant.  In general, inclusion of <corInfo> parameter is
        useful if the registry has the authority information, such as,
        the number portability data, etc., in order to qualify whether
        the registrant claim can be satisfied.  If the carrier-of-record
        claim disagrees with the authority data in the registry, whether
        the TN add operation fails or not is a matter of policy and it
        is beyond the scope of this document.  In the response message
        <spppUpdateResponse>, the SPPP server must include the <cor>
        parameter of the <corInfo> element to let the registrant know
        the outcome of the claim.

   A routing number is provisioned using the RNType, an extension of
   PubIDType.  SSPs that possess the number portability data may be able
   to leverage the RN search key to discover the ingress routes for
   session establishment.  Therefore, the registrant organization can
   add the RN and associate it with the appropriate destination group to
   share the route information.  Each RNType object is uniquely
   identified by the combination of its <rn> element, and the unique key
   of its parent Destination Group (dgName and rantId).  In other words
   a given routing number string may exist within one or more
   Destination Groups, but must not exist more than once within a
   Destination Group.  RNType is defined as follows:

   RNType has the following attributes:

   o    rn: Routing Number used as the search key

   o    corInfo: Optional <corInfo> element of type CORInfoType.

   TNRType structure is used to provision a contiguous range of
   telephone numbers.  The object definition requires a starting TN and
   an ending TN that together define the span of the TN range.  Use of
   TNRType is particularly useful when expressing a TN range that does
   not include all the TNs within a TN block or prefix.  The TNRType
   definition accommodates the open number plan as well such that the
   TNs that fall between the start and end TN range may include TNs with
   different length variance.  Whether the registry can accommodate the
   open number plan semantics is a matter of policy and is beyond the
   scope of this document.  Each TNRType object is uniquely identified
   by the combination of its <startTn> and <endTn> elements, and the
   unique key of its parent Destination Group (dgName and rantId).  In
   other words a given TN Range may exist within one or more Destination
   Groups, but must not exist more than once within a Destination Group.
   TNRType object structure definition is as follows:

   TNRType has the following attributes:

   o    startTn: Starting TN in the TN range

   o    endTn: The last TN in the TN range

   o    corInfo: Optional <corInfo> element of type CORInfoType

   In some cases, it is useful to describe a set of TNs with the help of
   the first few digits of the telephone number, also referred to as the
   telephone number prefix or a block.  A given TN prefix may include
   TNs with different length variance in support of open number plan.
   Once again, whether the registry supports the open number plan
   semantics is a matter of policy and it is beyond the scope of this
   document.  The TNPType data structure is used to provision a TN
   prefix.  Each TNPType object is uniquely identified by the
   combination of its <tnPrefix> element, and the unique key of its
   parent Destination Group (dgName and rantId).  TNPType is defined as
   follows:

6.4.  Get Public Identifiers Operation

   The SPPP client can use the GetPubIdsRqstType in the
   <spppQueryRequest> structure to obtain information about one or more
   <pi> objects.  If no matching Public Identifiers are found, then an
   empty result set is returned.

   GetPubIdsRqstType object structure is as follows:

   As described earlier in the document, the result of any
   spppQueryRequest operation is a spppQueryResponse that contains the
   response code and the query result set, if any.

6.5.  Add Route Group Operation

   As described in the introductory sections, a Route Group represents a
   combined grouping of Route Records that define route information,
   Destination Groups that contain a set of Public Identifiers with
   common routing information, and the list of peer organizations that
   have access to these public identifiers using this route information.
   It is this indirect linking of public identifiers to their route
   information that significantly improves the scalability and
   manageability of the peering data.  Additions and changes to routing

   information are reduced to a single operation on a Route Group or
   Route Record , rather than millions of data updates to individual
   public identifier records that individually contain their peering
   data.

   The AddRteGrpRqstType operation creates or overwrites a Route Group
   object.  If a Route Group with the given name and registrant ID
   (which together comprise the unique key or a Route Group) does not
   exist, then the server MUST create the Route Group.  If a Route Group
   with the given name and registrant ID does exist, then the server
   MUST replace the current properties of the Route Group with the
   properties passed into the AddRteGrpRqstType operation.  The XSD
   declarations of the AddRteGrpRqstType operation request object are as
   follows:



     <complexType name="AddRteGrpRqstType">

   The element passed into the spppUpdateRequest element for this
   operation is an instance of AddRteGrpRqstType, which extends
   BasicUpdateRqstType and contains one RteGrpType object.  The
   RteGrpType object structure is defined as follows:

   The RteGrpType object is composed of the following elements:

   o    base: All first class objects extend BasicObjType that contains
        the ID of the registrant organization that owns this object, the
        date and time that the object was created by the server, and the
        date and time that the object was last modified.  If the client
        passes in either the created date or the modification date, the
        server will ignore them.  The server sets these two date/time
        values.

   o    rgName: The character string that contains the name of the Route
        Group.  It uniquely identifies this object within the context of
        the registrant ID (a child element of the base element as
        described above).

   o    rrRef: Set of zero or more objects of type RteRecRefType that
        house the unique keys of the Route Records that the RteGrpType
        object refers to and their relative priority within the context

        of a given route group.  The associated Route Records contain
        the routing information, sometimes called SED, associated with
        this Route Group.

   o    dgName: Set of zero or more names of DestGrpType object
        instances.  Each dgName name, in association with this Route
        Group's registrant ID, uniquely identifies a DestGrpType object
        instance whose public identifiers are reachable using the
        routing information housed in this Route Group.  An intended
        side affect of this is that a Route Group cannot provide routing
        information for a Destination Group belonging to another
        registrant.

   o    peeringOrg: Set of zero or more peering organization IDs that
        have accepted an offer to receive this Route Group's
        information.  The set of peering organizations in this list is
        not directly settable or modifiable using the addRteGrpsRqst
        operation.  This set is instead controlled using the route offer
        and accept operations.

   o    sourceIdent: Set of zero or more SourceIdentType object
        instances.  These objects, described further below, house the
        source identification schemes and identifiers that are applied
        at resolution time as part of source based routing algorithms
        for the Route Group.

   o    isInSvc: A boolean element that defines whether this Route Group
        is in service.  The routing information contained in a Route
        Group that is in service is a candidate for inclusion in
        resolution responses for public identities residing in the
        Destination Group associated with this Route Group.  The routing
        information contained in a Route Group that is not in service is
        not a candidate for inclusion in resolution responses.

   o    priority: Zero or one priority value that can be used to provide
        a relative value weighting of one Route Group over another.  The
        manner in which this value is used, perhaps in conjunction with
        other factors, is a matter of policy.

   o    ext: Point of extensibility described in a previous section of
        this document.

   As described above, the Route Group contains a set of references to
   route record objects.  A route record object is based on an abstract
   type: RteRecType.  The concrete types that use RteRecType as an
   extension base are NAPTRType, NSType, and URIType.  The definitions
   of these types are included the Route Record section of this
   document.

   The RteGrpType object provides support for source-based routing via
   the peeringOrg data element and more granular source base routing via
   the source identity element.  The source identity element provides
   the ability to specify zero or more of the following in association
   with a given Route Group: a regular expression that is matched
   against the resolution client IP address, a regular expression that
   is matched against the root domain name(s), and/or a regular
   expression that is matched against the calling party URI(s).  The
   result will be that, after identifying the visible Route Groups whose
   associated Destination Group(s) contain the lookup key being queried
   and whose peeringOrg list contains the querying organizations
   organization ID, the resolution server will evaluate the
   characteristics of the Source URI, and Source IP address, and root
   domain of the lookup key being queried.  The resolution server then
   compares these criteria against the source identity criteria
   associated with the Route Groups.  The routing information contained
   in Route Groups that have source based routing criteria will only be
   included in the resolution response if one or more of the criteria
   matches the source criteria from the resolution request.  The Source
   Identity data element is of type SourceIdentType, whose structure is
   defined as follows:



     <complexType name="SourceIdentType">
       <sequence>
         <element name="sourceIdentLabel" type="string"/>
         <element name="sourceIdentScheme"

       </restriction>
     </simpleType>


   The SourceIdentType object is composed of the following data
   elements:

   o    sourceIdentScheme: The source identification scheme that this
        source identification criteria applies to and that the
        associated sourceIdentRegex should be matched against.

   o    sourceIdentRegex: The regular expression that should be used to
        test for a match against the portion of the resolution request
        that is dictated by the associated sourceIdentScheme.

   o    ext: Point of extensibility described in a previous section of
        this document.

   As with the responses to all update operations, the result of the
   AddRteGrpRqstType operation is contained in the generic
   spppUpdateResponse data structure described in an earlier sections of
   this document.  For a detailed description of the spppUpdateResponse
   data structure refer to that section of the document.

6.6.  Get Route Groups Operation

   The getRteGrpsRqst operation allows an SPPP client to get the
   properties of Route Group objects that the registrar is authorized to
   view on behalf of the registrant.  The server will attempt to find a
   Route Group object that has the registrant ID and route group name
   pair contained in each ObjKeyType object instance.  If no ObjKeyType
   objects are found in the request then the server will return the list
   of all Route Group objects that belongs to the registrant.  If there
   are no matching Route Groups found then an empty result set will be
   returned.

   The element passed into the spppQueryRequest element for this
   operation is an instance of type GetRteGrpsRqstType, which extends
   BasicUpdateRqstType and contains zero or more ObjKeyType objects.
   Any limitation on the maximum number of objects that may be passed
   into or returned by this operation is a policy decision and not
   limited by the protocol.  The XSD declaration of the operation is as
   follows:



     <complexType name="GetRteGrpsRqstType">

         <extension base="spppb:BasicQueryRqstType">

   any spppQueryRequest operation is an spppQueryResponse element that
   contains the overall response code and the query result set, if any.
   Refer to that section of the document for a detailed description of
   the spppQueryResponse element.

6.7.  Add Route Record Operation

   As described in the introductory sections, a Route Group represents a
   combined grouping of Route Records that define route information.
   However, Route Records need not be created to just serve a single
   Route Group.  Route Records can be created and managed to serve
   multiple Route Groups.  As a result, a change to the properties of a
   network node used for multiple routes, would necessitate just a
   single update operation to change the properties of that node.  The
   change would then be reflected in all the Route Groups whose route
   record set contains a reference to that node.

   The AddRteRecRqstType operation creates or overwrites a Route Record
   object.  If a Route Record with the given name and registrant ID
   (which together comprise the unique key or a Route Record) does not
   exist, then the server MUST create the Route Record.  If a Route
   Record with the given name and registrant ID does exist, then the
   server MUST replace the current properties of the Route Record with
   the properties passed into the AddRteRecRqstType operation.  The XSD
   declarations of the AddRteRecRqstType operation request object are as
   follows:



     <complexType name="AddRteRecRqstType">
       <complexContent>
         <extension base="spppb:BasicUpdateRqstType">

     </complexType>


   The element passed into the spppUpdateRequest element for this
   operation is an instance of AddRteRecRqstType, which extends
   BasicUpdateRqstType and contains one RteRecType object.  The
   RteRecType object structure is defined as follows:

         </sequence>
      </extension>
    </complexContent>
  </complexType>


   The RteRecType object is composed of the following elements:

   o    base: All first class objects extend BasicObjType that contains
        the ID of the registrant organization that owns this object, the
        date and time that the object was created by the server, and the
        date and time that the object was last modified.  If the client
        passes in either the created date or the modification date, the
        server will ignore them.  The server sets these two date/time
        values.

   o    rrName: The character string that contains the name of the Route
        Record.  It uniquely identifies this object within the context
        of the registrant ID (a child element of the base element as
        described above).

   o    priority: Zero or one priority value that can be used to provide
        a relative value weighting of one Route Record over another.
        The manner in which this value is used, perhaps in conjunction
        with other factors, is a matter of policy.

   As described above, route records are based on an abstract type:
   RteRecType.  The concrete types that use RteRecType as an extension
   base are NAPTRType, NSType, and URIType.  The definitions of these
   types are included below.  The NAPTRType object is comprised of the
   data elements necessary for a NAPTR that contains routing information
   for a Route Group.  The NSType object is comprised of the data
   elements necessary for a DNS name server that points to another DNS
   server that contains the desired routing information.  The NSType is
   relevant only when the resolution protocol is ENUM.  The URIType
   object is comprised of the data elements necessary to house a URI.

   The data provisioned in a registry can be leveraged for many purposes
   and queried using various protocols including SIP, ENUM and others.
   It is for this reason that a route record type offers a choice of URI

   data structure refer to that section of the document.

6.8.  Get Route Records Operation

   The getRteRecsRqst operation allows an SPPP client to get the
   properties of Route Record objects that a registrar is authorized to
   view on behalf of the registrant.  The server will attempt to find a
   Route Record object that has the registrant ID and route record name
   pair contained in each ObjKeyType object instance.  If no ObjKeyType
   objects are found in the request then the server will return the list
   of all Route Record that belongs to the registrant.  If there are no
   matching Route Record found then an empty result set will be
   returned.

   The element passed into the spppQueryRequest element for this
   operation is an instance of type GetRteRecsRqstType, which extends
   BasicUpdateRqstType and contains zero or more ObjKeyType objects.
   Any limitation on the maximum number of objects that may be passed
   into or returned by this operation is a policy decision and not
   limited by the protocol.  The XSD declaration of the operation is as
   follows:

   As described in an earlier section of this document, the result of
   any spppQueryRequest operation is an spppQueryResponse element that
   contains the overall response code and the query result set, if any.
   Refer to that section of the document for a detailed description of
   the spppQueryResponse element.

6.9.  Add Route Group Offer Operation

   The list of peer organizations whose resolution responses can include
   the routing information contained in a given Route Group is
   controlled by the organization to which a Route Group object belongs
   (its registrant), and the peer organization that submits resolution
   requests (a data recipient, also know as a peering organization).
   The registrant offers access to a Route Group by submitting a Route
   Group Offer.  The data recipient can then accept or reject that
   offer.  Not until access to a Route Group has been offered and
   accepted will the data recipient's organization ID be included in the
   peeringOrg list in a Route Group object, and that Route Group's
   peering information become a candidate for inclusion in the responses
   to the resolution requests submitted by that data recipient.  The
   AddRteGrpOffersRqstType operation creates or overwrites one or more
   Route Group Offer objects.  If a Route Group Offer for the given
   Route Group object key and the <offeredTo> Org ID does not exist,
   then the server creates the Route Group Offer object.  If a such a
   Route Group Offer does exist, then the server replaces the current
   object with the new object.  The XSD declarations of the operation
   request object are as follows:

   The RteGrpOfferType object is composed of the following elements:

   o    base: All first class objects extend BasicObjType that contains
        the ID of the registrant organization that owns this object, the
        date and time that the object was created by the server, and the
        date and time that the object was last modified.  If the client
        passed in either the created date or the modification date, the
        will ignore them.  The server sets these two date/time values.

   o    rteGrpOfferKey: The object that identifies the route that is or
        has been offered and the organization that it is or has been
        offered to.  The combination of these three data elements
        uniquely identify a Route Group Offer.

   o    status: The status of the offer, offered or accepted.  The
        server controls the status.  It is automatically set to
        "offered" when ever a new Route Group Offer is added, and is
        automatically set to "accepted" if and when that offer is
        accepted.  The value of the element is ignored when passed in by
        the client.

   o    offerDateTime: Date and time in UTC when the Route Group Offer
        was added.

   o    acceptDateTime: Date and time in UTC when the Route Group Offer
        was accepted.

   As with the responses to all update operations, the result of the
   AddRteGrpOfferRqstType operation is contained in the generic
   spppUpdateResponse data structure described in an earlier sections of
   this document.  For a detailed description of the spppUpdateResponse
   data structure refer to that section of the document.

6.10.  Accept Route Group Offer Operation

   Not until access to a Route Group has been offered and accepted will
   the data recipient's organization ID will it be included in the
   peeringOrg list in that Route Group object, and that Route Group's
   peering information become a candidate for inclusion in the responses
   to the resolution requests submitted by that data recipient.  The
   AcceptRteGrpOffersRqstType operation is called by, or on behalf of,
   the data recipient to accept a Route Group Offer that is pending in
   the "offered" status for the data recipient's organization ID.  If a
   Route Group Offer for the given Route Group Offer key (route name,
   route registrant ID, data recipient's organization ID) exists, then
   the server moves the Route Group Offer to the "accepted" status and
   adds that data recipient's organization ID into the list of
   peerOrgIds for that Route Group.  If a such a Route Group Offer does

   data structure refer to that section of the document.

6.11.  Reject Route Group Offer Operation

   The data recipient to which a Route Group has been offered has the
   option of rejecting a Route Group Offer.  Furthermore, that offer may
   be rejected, regardless of whether or not it has been previously
   accepted.  The RejectRteGrpOffersRqstType operation is used for these
   purposes and is called by, or on behalf of, the data recipient to
   accept a Route Group Offer that is pending in the "offered" status or
   is in the "accepted" status for the data recipient's organization ID.
   If a Route Group Offer for the given Route Group Offer key (route
   name, route registrant ID, data recipient's organization ID) exists
   in either the offered or accepted status, then the server deletes
   that Route Group Offer object, and, if appropriate, removes the data
   recipient's organization ID from the list of peeringOrg IDs for that
   Route Group.  If the Route Group Offer does not exist, then the

6.12.  Get Route Group Offers Operation

   The getRteGrpOffersRqst operation allows an SPPP client to get the
   properties of zero or more Route Group Offer objects that registrar
   is authorized to view on behalf of the registrant.  The server will
   attempt to find Route Group Offer objects that have all the
   properties specified in the criteria passed into the operation.  If
   no criteria is passed in then the server will return the list of
   Route Group Offer objects that belongs to the registrant.  If there
   are no matching Route Group Offers found then an empty result set
   will be returned.

6.13.  Egress Route Operations

   In a high-availability environment, the originating SSP likely has
   more than one egress paths to the ingress SBE of the target SSP.  If
   the originating SSP wants to exercise greater control and choose a
   specific egress SBE to be associated to the target ingress SBE, it
   can do so using the AddEgrRteRqstType object.

   Lets assume that the target SSP has offered to share one or more
   ingress route information and that the originating SSP has accepted
   the offer.  In order to add the egress route to the registry, the
   originating SSP uses a valid regular expression to rewrite ingress
   route in order to include the egress SBE information.  Also, more
   than one egress route can be associated with a given ingress route in
   support of fault-tolerant configurations.  The supporting SPPP
   structure provides a way to include route precedence information to
   help manage traffic to more than one outbound egress SBE.

   An egress route is identified by type EgrRteType and its object
   structure is shown below:



    <complexType name="EgrRteType">
      <complexContent>
       <extension base="spppb:BasicObjType">

           <element name="ingrRteRec" type="spppb:ObjKeyType"
              minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
           <element name="ext" type="spppb:ExtAnyType" minOccurs="0"/>
         </sequence>
       </extension>
      </complexContent>
    </complexType>


   The EgrRteType object is composed of the following elements:

   o    base: All first class objects extend BasicObjType that contains
        the ID of the registrant organization that owns this object, the
        date and time that the object was created by the server, and the
        date and time that the object was last modified.  If the client
        passes in either the created date or the modification date, the
        server will ignore them.  The server sets these two date/time
        values.

   o    egrRteName: The name of the egress route.

   o    pref: The preference of this egress route relative to other
        egress routes that may get selected when responding to a
        resolution request.

   o    regxRewriteRule: The regular expression re-write rule that
        should be applied to the regular expression of the ingress
        NAPTR(s) that belong to the ingress route.

   o    ingrRteRec: The ingress route records that the egress route
        should be used for.

   o    ext: Point of extensibility described in a previous section of
        this document.

   The AddEgrRteRqstType request is used to create or overwrite an
   egress route.

           </sequence>
         </extension>
       </complexContent>
     </complexType>


   An instance of AddEgrRtesRqstType is added in the spppUpdateRequest
   element in order to send a valid request to the server.  Any
   limitation on the maximum number of AddEgrRteRqstType instances is a
   matter of policy and is not limited by the specification.

   The response from the server is returned in addEgrRteRspns element,
   which is defined as the element of type BasicRspnsType.

   The GetEgrRtesRqstType is used by an authorized entity to fetch the
   well-known egress route data.

6.14.  Delete Operation

   In order to remove an object from the registry, an authorized entity
   can send the <spppUpdateRequest> to the registry with a corresponding
   delete BasicUpdateRqstType object.  Each 'Add' operation in SPPP has
   a corresponding 'Del' operation, which is used to delete the
   respective object type from the registry.  If the entity that issued
   the command is not authorized to perform this operation an
   appropriate error code will be returned in the <spppUpdateRespnonse>
   message.

   As an example, DelPubIdRqstType is used to delete Public Identifiers
   The DelPubIdsRqstType object definition is shown below:



     <complexType name="DelPubIdRqstType">
       <complexContent>
         <extension base="spppb:BasicUpdateRqstType">
           <sequence>
             <element name="pi" type="spppb:PubIdType"/>
           </sequence>
         </extension>
       </complexContent>
     </complexType>


   When an object is deleted, any references to that object must of
   course also be removed as the SPPP server implementation fulfills the
   deletion request.  Furthermore, the deletion of a composite object
   must also result in the deletion of the objects it contains.  As a
   result, the following rules apply to the deletion of SPPP object
   types:

   o    Destination Groups: When a destination group is deleted all
        public identifiers within that destination group must also be

        automatically deleted by the SPPP implementation as part of
        fulfilling the deletion request.  And any references between
        that destination group and any route group must be automatically
        removed by the SPPP implementation as part of fulfilling the
        deletion request.

   o    Route Groups: When a route group is deleted any references
        between that route group and any destination group must be
        automatically removed by the SPPP implementation as part of
        fulfilling the deletion request.  Similarly any references
        between that route group and any route records must be removed
        by the SPPP implementation as part of fulfilling the deletion
        request.  Furthermore, route group offers relating that route
        group must also be deleted as part of fulfilling the deletion
        request.

   o    Route Records: When a route record is deleted any references
        between that route record and any route group must be removed by
        the SPPP implementation as part of fulfilling the deletion
        request.

   o    Public Identifiers: When a public identifier is deleted any
        references between that public identifier and its containing
        destination group must be removed by the SPPP implementation as
        part of fulfilling the deletion request.  And any route records
        contained directly within that Public Identifier must be deleted
        by the SPPP implementation as part of fulfilling the deletion
        request.

7.  SPPP Examples

   This section shows XML message exchange between two SIP Service
   Providers (SSP) and a registry.  For the sake of simplicity, the
   transport wrapper for the SPPP is left out.  The SPPP messages in
   this section are valid XML instances that conform to the SPPP schema
   version within this document.

   In this sample use case scenario, SSP1 and SSP2 provision resource
   data in the registry and use SPPP constructs to selectively share the
   route groups.  In the figure below, SSP2 has two ingress SBE
   instances that are associated with the public identities that SSP2
   has the retail relationship with.  Also, the two SBE instances for
   SSP1 are used to show how to use SPPP to associate route preferences
   for the destination ingress routes and exercise greater control on
   outbound traffic to the peer's ingress SBEs.

7.1.  Add Destination Group

   SSP2 adds a destination group to the registry for use later.  The
   SSP2 SPPP client sets a unique transaction identifier 'tx_7777' for
   tracking purposes.  The name of the destination group is set to
   DEST_GRP_SSP2_1

   performs the required checks to verify that SSP2 is in fact the
   service provider of record for the given TN, the request is processed
   successfully.  In the response message, the registry sets the value
   of <cor> to "true" in order to confirm SSP2 claim as the carrier of
   record and the <corDate> reflects the time when the carrier of record
   claim is processed.

   If another entity that SSP2 shares the routes with has access to
   Number Portability data, it may choose to perform route lookups by
   routing number.  Therefore, SSP2 associates a routing number to a
   destination group in order to facilitate ingress route discovery.

7.9.  Enable Peering -- Route Group Offer

   In order for SSP1 to complete session establishment for a destination
   TN where the target subscriber has a retail relationship with SSP2,
   it first requires an asynchronous bi-directional handshake to show
   mutual consent.  To start the process, SSP2 initiates the peering
   handshake by offering SSP1 access to its route group.

8.  XML Considerations

   XML serves as the encoding format for SPPP, allowing complex
   hierarchical data to be expressed in a text format that can be read,
   saved, and manipulated with both traditional text tools and tools
   specific to XML.

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented to develop a conforming implementation.

   This section discusses a small number of XML-related considerations
   pertaining to SPPP.

8.1.  Namespaces

   All SPPP elements are defined in the namespaces in the IANA
   Considerations section and in the Formal Protocol Specification
   section of this document.

8.2.  Versioning and Character Encoding

   All XML instances SHOULD begin with an <?xml?> declaration to
   identify the version of XML that is being used, optionally identify
   use of the character encoding used, and optionally provide a hint to
   an XML parser that an external schema file is needed to validate the
   XML instance.

   Conformant XML parsers recognize both UTF-8 (defined in [RFC3629])
   and UTF-16 (defined in [RFC2781]); per [RFC2277] UTF-8 is the
   RECOMMENDED character encoding for use with SPPP.

   Character encodings other than UTF-8 and UTF-16 are allowed by XML.
   UTF-8 is the default encoding assumed by XML in the absence of an
   "encoding" attribute or a byte order mark (BOM); thus, the "encoding"
   attribute in the XML declaration is OPTIONAL if UTF-8 encoding is
   used.  SPPP clients and servers MUST accept a UTF-8 BOM if present,
   though emitting a UTF-8 BOM is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   Example XML declarations:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>

9.  Security Considerations

   Many SPPP implementations manage data that is considered confidential
   and critical.  Furthermore, SPPP implementations can support
   provisioning activities for multiple registrars and registrants.  As
   a result any SPPP implementation must address the requirements for
   confidentiality, authentication, and authorization.

   With respect to confidentiality and authentication, the transport
   protocol requirements section of this document contains security
   properties that the transport protocol must provide so that
   authenticated endpoints can exchange data confidentially and with
   integrity protection.  Refer to that section and the resulting
   transport protocol specification document for the specific solutions
   to authentication and confidentiality.

   With respect to authorization, the SPPP server implementation must
   define and implement a set of authorization rules that precisely
   address (1) which registrars will be authorized to create/modify/
   delete each SPPP object type for given registrant(s) and (2) which
   registrars will be authorized to view/get each SPPP object type for
   given registrant(s).  These authorization rules are a matter of
   policy and are not specified within the context of SPPP.  However,
   any SPPP implementation must specify these authorization rules in
   order to function in a reliable and safe manner.

   In some situations, it may be required to protect against denial of
   involvement (see [RFC4949]) and tackle non-repudiation concerns in
   regards to SPPP messages.  This type of protection is useful to
   satisfy authenticity concerns related to SPPP messages beyond the
   end-to-end connection integrity, confidentiality, and authentication
   protection that the transport layer provides.  This is an optional
   feature and some SPPP implementations MAY provide support for it.

   It is not uncommon for the logging systems to document on-the-wire
   messages for various purposes, such as, debug, audit, and tracking.
   At the minimum, the various support and administration staff will
   have access to these logs.  Also, if an unprivileged user gains
   access to the SPPP deployments and/or support systems, it will have
   access to the information that is potentially deemed confidential.
   To manage information disclosure concerns beyond the transport level,
   SPPP implementations MAY provide support for encryption at the SPPP
   object level.

   Anti-replay protection ensures that a given SPPP object replayed at a
   later time doesn't affect the integrity of the system.  SPPP provides
   at least one mechanism to fight against replay attacks.  Use of the
   optional client transaction identifier allows the SPPP client to

   correlate the request message with the response and to be sure that
   it is not a replay of a server response from earlier exchanges.  Use
   of unique values for the client transaction identifier is highly
   encouraged to avoid chance matches to a potential replay message.

   The SPPP client or registrar can be a separate entity acting on
   behalf of the registrant in facilitating provisioning transactions to
   the registry.  Further, the transport layer provides end-to-end
   connection protection between SPPP client and the SPPP server.
   Therefore, man-in-the-middle attack is a possibility that may affect
   the integrity of the data that belongs to the registrant and/or
   expose peer data to unintended actors in case well-established
   peering relationships already exist.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].

   Two URI assignments are requested.

   Registration request for the SPPP XML namespace:
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:sppp:base:1
   Registrant Contact: IESG
   XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the XML schema:
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:sppp:1
   Registrant Contact: IESG
   XML: See the "Formal Specification" section of this document
   (Section 11).

   IANA is requested to create a new SPPP registry for Organization
   Identifiers that will indicate valid strings to be used for well-
   known enterprise namespaces.
   This document makes the following assignments for the OrgIdType
   namespaces:



         Namespace                    OrgIdType namespace string
         ----                         ----------------------------
