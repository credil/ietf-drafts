Abstract

   Several approaches to transporting the ITU-T Q.931 User to User
   Information Element (UU IE) data in SIP have been implemented.  As
   networks move to SIP it is important that applications requiring this
   data can continue to function in SIP networks as well as the ability
   to interwork the information to/from ISDN for end-to-end
   transparency.  This document discusses the approaches and recommends
   a new header field User-to-User be standardized.  An example

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 January 2008


1.  Overview

   This document describes the transport of User to User Information
   (UUI) in ISDN interworking scenarios using SIP [1].  Specifically, we
   discuss the transport of call control related ITU-T Q.931 User to
   User Information Element (UU IE) [2] data in SIP.  An example use
   case is interworking an Automatic Call Distributed (ACD) in a contact
   center.


2.  Roles

   There are three roles in a typical Call Center scenario:


  Originator -      The party generating the call destined for the contact
                    center.

  ACD -             The automatic call distributor which performs database
                    queries and determines proper routing for the call.

  Terminator  -     The destination of the call as determined by the ACD.



3.  Approaches

   Four approaches will be described: MIME body, header field, and URI
   parameter transport.

3.1.  Why INFO is Not Used

   Since the INFO method was developed for ISUP interworking of user-to-
   user information, it might seem to be the logical choice here.  For
   non-call control user-to-user information, INFO can be utilized for
   end to end transport.  However, for transport of call control user-
   to-user information, INFO can not be used.  As the call flows in the
   next section show, the information is related to an attempt to
   establish a session and must be passed with the session setup request
   (INVITE), responses to that INVITE, or session termination requests.
   As a result, it is not possible to use INFO in these cases.

3.2.  Call Flows

   All three approaches use the same call flows, shown in Figures 1, 2,
   and 4 below.  Figure 1 shows the ACD redirecting the call prior to it
   being answered using a 302 Moved Temporarily response.  User to user
   information (UUI) is added by the ACD which is then included in the

   INVITE sent to the Terminator.  The URI of the terminator is
   contained in the Contact header field of message F2.

   Figure 1.  Call flow with redirection prior to answer.

   Figure 2 shows a call flow in which the call is answered by the ACD
   and then the call is transferred using a REFER.  If the ACD does not
   care to receive notification of the outcome of the transfer, the BYE
   could be sent immediately, or the Refer-Sub: false header field added
   to the REFER.  If the REFER is sent out of dialog, the Target-Dialog
   header field will need to be present.

   Figure 2.  Call flow with transfer after answer.

   Note that there have been some proposals to use REFER for scenario of
   Figure 1.  In this case, a REFER is sent by the ACD during the early
   dialog.  This NOT RECOMMENDED call flow is shown in Figure 3.  This
   flow is not recommended due to the number of messages exchanged (due
   to the REFER, CANCEL, and 487 responses) and the sending of the REFER
   in the early dialog.

3.3.  MIME body Approach

   One method of transport is to transport the UUI information as a MIME
   body.  This is in keeping with the SIP-T architecture in which MIME
   bodies are used to transport ISUP information.  However, in the SIP-T
   example, the body is added by the originator and used by the
   terminator.  The insertion of the UUI by an intermediary, the ACD, is
   difficult.  The body would need to be encoded in the Contact URI of
   Figure 1 or the Refer-To URI of Figure 2.  For example, if the
   application/acd MIME type were defined:

Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?Content-Type=application/acd&body=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>

   The resulting INVITE would then have two message bodies, one SDP, the
   other being the MIME object.  In addition to the body, the escaped
   Content-Type header field should also be included in the resulting
   INVITE.

   While the body approach would work with the redirection and REFER
   call flows, but does not work with the proxy call flow of Figure 4.

3.4.  Header Field Approach

   Another approach that has been proposed is to use a header field to
   tranport the UUI information.  The header field would be excaped into
   the Contact or Refer-To URI.  The header field approach will work
   with the redirection, REFER, and proxy call flows.  The Call-Info

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 January 2008


   header field is related to the UUI information.  However, there are a
   number of important differences:
      Call-Info is for rendering to the user.  While some of the UUI
      information may ultimately be rendered to the user, most of the
      UUI information will be consumed by the end device.
      Call-Info contains a URI pointer the information instead of the
      actual information itself.

   The use of the data URI scheme [7] could be used to overcome the
   second issue, i.e.:

Call-Info: <data:applicaton/acd,ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>

   For these reasons, a separate header field needs to be defined,
   described here as User-to-User:

Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?User-to-User=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>

   The resulting INVITE would contain the User-to-User header field.

3.5.  URI Parameter

   Another proposed approach is to encode the UUI as a URI parameter
   into the Contact or Refer-To URI.

Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com;uui=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>

   The resulting INVITE would contain UUI in the Request-URI of the
   INVITE.  The URI parameter has a drawback in that a URI parameter
   will not survive retargeting by a proxy.  That is, if the URI is an
   Address of Record instead of a Contact URI, the URI parameter will
   not be copied over the Contact URI, resulting in the loss of the
   information.


4.  Recommendation

   The recommendation is to define a new SIP header field User-to-User
   to transport UUI information in ISDN interworking applications.

   The format of the UUI information is a topic of future
   standardization.  Currently, UUI is proprietary, requiring
   coordinated configuration between servers.  Standardizing the format
   or providing content tags would provide additional benefits.

   Current usage is to interoperate with ISDN User to User Signaling
   (UUS), a supplementary service in which manufacturer specific
   information is transported via the codeset 0 User-user Information

   IE.  Three services are defined: service 1, service 2, and service 3.
   This draft only addresses the SIP equivalent of service 1 although it
   could easily be expanded later to address services 2 and 3.  UUS
   Service 1 involves user to user signaling exchanged during call setup
   and clearing within the following Q.931 call control messages: SETUP,
   ALERT, CONNECT, DISCONNECT, RELEASE, and RELEASE COMPLETE.  UUS
   Service 2 involves user to user signaling exchanged during call
   establishment (between ALERT and CONNECT) via the USER INFORMATION
   message.  This service usually has a maximum of 2 USER INFORMATION
   messages in each direction.  UUS Service 3 involves user to user
   signaling exchanged on an active call via the USER INFORMATION
   message.


5.  Appendix - Syntax for UUI Header Field

   Editor's Note: Eventually this text will move to a SIP Working Group
   document to define the new header field.

   The User-to-User header field can be present in INVITE requests and
   responses only and in BYE requests and responses.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC 2234 and extends RFC 3261.

         UUI             = "User-to-User" HCOLON uui-data *(SEMI uui-param)
         uui-data        = token
         uui-param       = enc-param | generic-param
         enc-param       = "encoding=" ("hex" | token)

   Only one User-to-User header field may be present in a request or
   response.

   The only defined parameter for the User-to-User header field is the
   encoding parameter. "encoding=hex" is used to indicate that the UUI
   information is encoded as hex digits per the ISDN specification
   (including the protocol discriminator).  Other encoding methods of
   encoding may also be standardized.


6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.


7.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
