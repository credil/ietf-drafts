Internet-Draft              STUN test vectors                August 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Session Traversal Utilities for NAT
   (STUN)[I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis] protocol defines two different
   hashes that may be included in messages exchanged by peers
   implementing that protocol:

   FINGERPRINT attribute:  a 32-bits Circular Redundancy Check.
   MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute:  a HMAC-SHA1 authentication code.

   This document documents sample properly-formatted STUN messages
   including these hashes, for the sake of testing implementations of
   the STUN protocol.

2.  Test vectors

   All included vectors are represented as a series of hexadecimal
   values in network byte order.  Each pair of hexadecimal digits
   represents one byte.

   Messages follow the ICE Connectivity Checks use case of STUN, (see
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice]).  They include both FINGERPRINT and MESSAGE-
   INTEGRITY attributes.

2.1.  Sample request

   This request uses the following parameters:
   Username:  "evtj:h6vY" (without quotes)
   Password:  "VOkJxbRl1RmTxUk/WvJxBt" (without quotes)
