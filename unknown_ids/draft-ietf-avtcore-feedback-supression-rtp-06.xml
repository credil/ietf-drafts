    <abstract>
      <t>In a large RTP session using the RTCP feedback mechanism defined in
      RFC 4585, a feedback target may experience transient overload if some
      event causes a large number of receivers to send feedback at once. This
      overload is usually avoided by ensuring that feedback reports are
      forwarded to all receivers, allowing them to avoid sending duplicate
      feedback reports. However, there are cases where it is not recommended
      to forward feedback reports, and this may allow feedback implosion. This
      memo discusses these cases and defines a new RTCP third-party loss
      report that can be used to inform receivers that a feedback target is
      aware of some loss event, allowing them to suppress feedback. Associated
      SDP signalling is also defined.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>RTCP feedback messages <xref target="RFC4585"></xref> allow the
      receivers in an RTP session to report events and ask for action from the
      media source (or a delegated feedback target when using unicast RTCP
      feedback with SSM <xref target="RFC5760"></xref>). There are cases where
      multiple receivers may initiate the same, or an equivalent message
      towards the same media source. When the receiver count is large, this
      behavior may cause transient overload of the media source, the network
      or both. This is known as a "feedback storm" or a "NACK storm". One
      common cause of such a feedback storm is receivers utilizing RTP
      retransmission <xref target="RFC4588"></xref> as a packet loss recovery
      technique based, sending feedback using RTCP NACK messages <xref
      target="RFC4585"></xref> without proper dithering of the retransmission
      requests.</t>

      <t>Another use case involves video Fast Update requests. A storm of
      these feedback messages can occur in conversational multimedia scenarios
      like Topo-Video-switch-MCU <xref target="RFC5117"></xref>. In this
      scenario, packet loss may happen on an upstream link of an intermediate
      network element such as a Multipoint Control Unit(MCU). Poorly designed
      receivers that blindly issue fast update requests (i.e., Full Intra
      Request (FIR) described in <xref target="RFC5104"></xref>), can cause an
      implosion of FIR requests from receivers to the same media source.</t>

      <t>RTCP feedback storms may cause short term overload, and in extreme
      cases to pose a possible risk of increasing network congestion on the
      control channel (e.g. RTCP feedback), the data channel, or both. It is
      therefore desirable to provide a way of suppressing unneeded
      feedback.</t>

      <t>One approach to this, suggested in <xref target="DVB-IPTV"></xref>,
      involves sending a NACK message to the other clients (or receiver) in
      the same group as the sender of NACK. However NACK is defined as a
      receiver report sent from a receiver observing a packet loss, therefore
      it only inform others that sender of NACK detected loss while the case
      the sender of the feedback has received reports that the indicated
      packets were lost is not covered. This document specifies a new
      third-party loss report for this function. It further is more precise in
      the intended uses and less likely to be confusing to receivers. It tells
      receivers explicitly that feedback for a particular packet or frame loss
      is not needed for a period of time and can provide an early indication
      before the receiver reacts to the loss and invokes its packet loss
      repair machinery. <xref target="Use"></xref> provides some examples of
      when to send the Third Party Loss Report message.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol Overview">
      <t>This document extends the RTCP feedback messages defined in the
      Audio-Visual Profile with feedback (RTP/AVPF) <xref
      target="RFC4585"></xref> defining a Third Party Loss Report message. The
      Third Party Loss Report message can be used by the media source or
      intermediaries to inform the receiver that the sender of the Third Party
      Loss Report has received reports that the indicated packets were lost,
      and asks the receiver not to send feedback to it regarding these
      packets.</t>

      <t>When a receiver gets a Third Party Loss Report message, it should
      refrain from sending a feedback request (e.g., NACK or FIR) for the
      missing packets reported in the message for a certain period of time. A
      receiver may still have sent a Feedback message according to the
      RTP/AVPF scheduling algorithm of <xref target="RFC4585"></xref>before
      receiving a Third Party Loss Report message, but further feedback
      messages for those sequence numbers will be suppressed by this technique
      for a certain period of time. Nodes that do not understand the Third
      Party Loss Report message will ignore it, and might therefore still send
      feedback according to the AVPF scheduling algorithm of <xref
      target="RFC4585"></xref>. The media source or intermediate nodes cannot
      assume that the use of a Third Party Loss Report message actually
      reduces the amount of feedback it receives.</t>

      <t>RTCP Third Party Loss Report follows the similar format of message
      type as RTCP NACK. However, the Third Party Loss Report is defined as an
      indication that the sender of the feedback has received reports that the
      indicated packets were lost, while NACK <xref target="RFC4585"></xref>
      just indicates that the sender of the NACK observed that these packets
      were lost. The Third Party Loss Report message is generated by a system
      that has not seen the actual packet loss. Systems that receive a Third
      Party Loss Report SHOULD NOT initiate their own additional Third Party
      Loss Report messages for the same packet sequence numbers. They may
      either simply forward the Third Party Loss Report message, or they may
      generate their own Third Party Loss Report that reports a set of the
      losses they see, which are different from ones reported in the Third
      Party Loss report they received. The Third Party Loss Report does not
      have the retransmission request <xref target="RFC4588"></xref>
      semantics.</t>

      <t>Since Third Party Loss Report interacts strongly with repair timing,
      it has to work together with feedback to not adversely impact the repair
      of lost source packets. One example is the middle box gets the
      retransmitted packet by sending a NACK upstream and sent it downstream.
      This retransmitted packet was lost on the downstream link. In order to
      deal with this, the downstream receiver can start a timeout in which it
      expected to get a retransmission packet. When this timeout expires and
      there is no retransmitted packet or a new Third Party Loss Report
      message, it can take its normal behavior as if there is no current
      retransmission suppression. In the case when the loss was detected and
      repair initiated much closer to the source, the delay for the receiver
      to recover from packet loss can be reduced through the combination of
      intermediary feedback to the source and Third Party Loss Report
      downstream.</t>

    <section anchor="sec4" title="Format of RTCP Feedback Messages">
      <t>This document registers two new RTCP Feedback messages for Third
      Party Loss Report. Applications that are employing one or more
      loss-repair methods MAY use the Third Party Loss Report together with
      their existing loss-repair methods either for every packet they expect
      to receive, or for an application-specific subset of the RTP packets in
      a session. In other words, receivers MAY ignore Third Party Loss Report
      messages, but SHOULD react to them unless they have good reason to still
      send feedback messages despite having been requested to suppress
      them.</t>

    <section anchor="Use" title="Example Use Cases">
      <t>The operation of feedback suppression is similar for all types of RTP
      sessions and topologies <xref target="RFC5117"></xref>, however the
      exact messages used and the scenarios in which suppression is employed
      differ for various use cases. The following sections outline some of the
      intended use cases for using the Third Party Loss Report for feedback
      suppression and give an overview of the particular mechanisms.</t>

      <section title="Source Specific Multicast (SSM) use case">
        <t>In SSM RTP sessions as described in <xref target="RFC5760"></xref>,
        one or more Media Sources send RTP packets to a Distribution Source.
        The Distribution Source relays the RTP packets to the receivers using
        a source-specific multicast group. Note that each receiver sending
        multicast NACK to its group may still need to send unicast NACK
        addressed to the media source or distribution source for lost packets,
        this may lead to a NACK storm if feedback suppression is not performed
        and if the RTCP bandwidth limit is misconfigured.</t>

        <t>As outlined in the [RFC5760], there are two Unicast Feedback models
        that may be used for reporting, - the Simple Feedback model and the
        Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model. In the simple Feedback
        Model, NACKs are reflected by the distribution source to the other
        receivers, and there's no need for distribution source to create the
        Third Party Loss Report. The Third Party Loss Report may be generated
        at the distribution source when downstream loss report is received in
        the Distribution Source Feedback Summary model, since this summary
        feedback does not mandate the forwarding of NACK downstream.</t>

        <t>In order to observe packet loss before the receivers perceive it,
        one or more intermediate nodes may be placed between the media source
        and the receivers. These intermediaries monitor for upstream packet
        loss . These intermediates may be Distribution source, MCUs, RTP
        translator, or RTP mixers, depending on the precise implementation. If
        an intermediary notices the loss itself, then it may send a NACK both
        downstream towards the receivers and upstream towards the media
        source, to indicate that it has noticed the loss, and to suppress
        feedback from other downstream receivers. In the SSM case, If the
        distribution source ,using the simple feedback model, receives a NACK
        from another system (e.g.,an intermediary), it should redistribute
        that NACK to all other systems that would not otherwise receive it. If
        the distribution source, using the summary feedback model, receives a
        NACK from another system, but, for some reason(e.g., to prevent
        revealing the identity or existence of a system sending NACK), cannot
        redistribute that NACK, then it may send a Third Party Loss Report to
        the systems that were unable to receive the NACK, and won't receive
        the NACK via other means. Therefore the intermediate node can be
        reasonably certain that it will help the situation by sending a Third
        Party Loss Report message to all the relevant receivers, thereby
        indicating to the receivers that they should not transmit feedback
        messages for a certain period of time. The intermediate node needs to
        take into account such factors as the tolerable application delay,
        packet loss recovery techniques, the network dynamics, and the media
        type. Loss-repair methods such as retransmission and Forward Error
        Correction may be used to recover the missing packet.</t>

        <t>Alternatively, the media source may directly monitor the amount of
        feedback reports it receives from downstream. If the media source
        notices the loss itself, then it may send a NACK downstream towards
        the receivers to suppress feedback. If the media source receives a
        NACK from another system, it should redistribute that NACK to all
        other systems that would not otherwise receive it. If the media source
        receives a NACK from another system, but, for some reason (e.g.,
        hiding identity or existing a system sending NACK ), cannot
        redistribute that NACK, then it may send a Third Party Loss Report to
        the systems that were unable to receive the NACK, and won't receive
        the NACK via other means.</t>

      <section title="Unicast based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast Stream (RAMS) use case">
        <t>The typical RAMS architecture <xref target="RFC6285"></xref> may
        have several Burst/Retransmission Sources(BRS) behind the multicast
        source (MS) placed at the same level. These BRSes will receive the
        multicast SSM stream from the media source. If one of the BRSes
        receives downstream loss report (i.e., First loss in <xref
        target="fig4"></xref>) on its downstream link, but the others BRSes
        have not, as the packet loss took place on the SSM tree branch that
        does not impact the other BRSes. In such case, the BRSes not being
        impacted are not aware of downstream loss at their downstream link,
        therefore these BRSes will not create a new Third Party Loss Report
        message and send it to receivers in their downstream path. If the BRS
        impacted by packet loss has been told the actual packet loss, the BRS
        MAY choose to create new Third Party Loss Report message and send it
        to the receivers in the downstream link. Note that BRS must use its
        own SSRC as packet sender SSRC for transmitting the feedback suppress
        message.</t>

        <t>The BRS may also send a NACK upstream to request the retransmitted
        packet. Upon receiving the retransmitted packet, the BRS sent it
        downstream. Note that this retransmitted packet may get lost (i.e.,
        second loss in the <xref target="fig4"></xref>) on the downstream
        link. In order to deal with this issue, the downstream receiver can
        start a timeout clock in which it expected to get a retransmission
        packet. When this timeout expires and there is no retransmitted packet
        or a new Third Party Loss Report message, it can take its normal
        behavior as if there is no current retransmission suppression in
        place. <figure align="center" anchor="fig4" title="RAMS Use Case">

      <section title="RTP transport translator use case">
        <t>A Transport Translator (Topo-Trn-Translator), as defined in <xref
        target="RFC5117"></xref> is typically forwarding the RTP and RTCP
        traffic between RTP clients, for example converting between multicast
        and unicast for domains that do not support multicast. The translator
        can identify packet loss using co-located monitor <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-monarch"></xref> by receiving a NACK from
        another system and then the monitor can use it's own SSRC as packet
        sender SSRC for transmitting the Third Party Loss Report message and
        send this message to the unicast receivers that is not aware of packet
        loss.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) use case">
        <t>In point to multipoint topologies using video switching MCU
        (Topo-Video-switch-MCU) <xref target="RFC5117"></xref>, the MCU
        typically forwards a single media stream to each participant, selected
        from the available input streams. The selection of the input stream is
        often based on voice activity in the audio-visual conference, but
        other conference management mechanisms (like presentation mode or
        explicit floor control) exist as well.</t>

        <t>In this case the MCU may identify packet loss by receiving a NACK
        from another system or may decide to switch to a new source. In both
        cases the receiver may lose synchronization with the video stream and
        may send a FIR request. If the MCU itself can detect the
        mis-synchronization of the video, the MCU can send the FIR suppression
        message to the receivers and send a FIR request to the video source.
        As suggested in RFC 5117, this topology is better implemented as an
        Topo-Mixer, in which case the mixer's SSRC is used as packet sender
        SSRC for transmitting the Third Party Loss Report message.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The defined messages have certain properties that have security
      implications. These must be addressed and taken into account by users of
      this protocol.</t>

      <t>Spoofed or maliciously created feedback messages of the type defined
      in this specification can have the following implications:</t>

      <t>Sending the Third Party Loss Report with wrong sequence number of
      lost packet that makes missing RTP packets can not be compensated.</t>

      <t>To prevent these attacks, there is a need to apply authentication and
      integrity protection of the feedback messages. This can be accomplished
      against threats external to the current RTP session using the RTP
      profile that combines Secure RTP <xref target="RFC3711"></xref> and AVPF
      into SAVPF <xref target="RFC5124"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Note that middleboxes that are not visible at the RTP layer that wish
      to send the Third Party Loss Reports on behalf of the media source can
      only do so if they spoof the SSRC of the media source. This is difficult
      in case SRTP is in use. If the middlebox is visible at the RTP layer,
      this is not an issue, provided the middlebox is part of the security
      context for the session.</t>

      <t>Also note that endpoints that receive a Third Party Loss Report would
      be well-advised to ignore it, unless it is authenticated via SRTCP or
      similar. Accepting un-authenticated Third Party Loss Report can lead to
      a denial of service attack, where the endpoint accepts poor quality
      media that could be repaired.</t>

    <section title="IANA Consideration">
      <t>New feedback type and New parameters for RTCP Third Party Loss Report
      are subject to IANA registration. For general guidelines on IANA
      considerations for RTCP feedback, refer to <xref
      target="RFC4585"></xref>.</t>
