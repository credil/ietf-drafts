      <t>This document specifies relation types for Web links, and defines a registry for them. It
        also defines how to send such links in HTTP headers with the Link header-field. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>A means of indicating the relationships between documents on the Web, as well as indicating
        the type of those relationships, has been available for some time in HTML <xref
          target="W3C.REC-html401-19991224" />, and more recently in Atom <xref target="RFC4287" />.
        These mechanisms, although conceptually similar, are separate. However, links between
        resources need not be format-specific; it can be useful to have typed links that are
        independent of the format, especially when a resource has representations in multiple
        formats.</t>

      <t>This document defines typed link relations, independent of the context they
        occur in. It does so by clarifying the status of the link relation registry established by
        Atom, and registering in it the relations that are defined by HTML.</t>

      <t>Furthermore, an HTTP header-field for conveying typed links was defined in <xref
          target="RFC2068" />, but removed from <xref target="RFC2616" />, due to a lack of
        implementation experience. Since then, several use cases for doing so have surfaced.
        However, because it was removed, the status of the Link header is unclear, leading some to
        consider minting new application-specific HTTP headers instead of reusing it. This document
        addresses this by re-specifying the Link header with updated but backwards-compatible
        syntax.</t>

        item of the HTTPBIS WG. ]]</t>

    <section title="Notational Conventions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
        "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
        BCP 14, <xref target="RFC2119" />, as scoped to those conformance targets.</t>

      <t>This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of <xref target="RFC2616"
         />, and explicitly includes the following rules from it: quoted-string, token, SP (space).
        Additionally, the following rules are included from <xref target="RFC3986" />: URI and
        URI-Reference, and from <xref target="RFC4288" />: type-name.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Links">
      <t>In the context of this specification, a link is comprised of: <list style="symbols">
          <t>A target URI (<xref target="RFC3986" />), and</t>
          <t>A context of use, and</t>
          <t>A link relation type (<xref target="link-relationship-types" />), and</t>
          <t>A link direction (outbound or inbound).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
	  <t>A link can be viewed as a statement of the form "(subject) has a (relation type) at (object)", 
		where for an outbound link the subject is the context of use and the object is the resource 
		identified by the target URI, and for an inbound link the subject is the resource identified by the target URI 
		and the object is the context of use.</t>
      <t>This specification does not define a general syntax for expressing links, nor the specific context for a given link; 
		it is expected that applications of link relations will specify both aspects. One such application is communication of links through
		HTTP headers, specified in <xref target="header.link" />.</t>
      <t>Such applications may further constrain or extend links (e.g., associating a media type
        hint, only allowing links in one direction).</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="link-relationship-types" title="Link Relation Types">
      <t>A link relation type identifies the semantics of a link. For example, an outbound link
        with the relation type "copyright" indicates that the resource identified is a statement of
        the copyright terms applying to the current context of the link.</t>
      <t>Relation types are not to be confused with media types <xref target="RFC4288" />; they
        do not identify the format of the representation that results when the link is dereferenced.
        Rather, they only describe how the current context is related to another resource.</t>
      <t>As such, relation types are not format-specific, and MUST NOT specify a particular format or media type 
	    that they are to be used with. Likewise, a relation type SHOULD NOT specify what its context of its use is.</t>
      <t>Relation types are URIs. Although specific applications of links may specify the use of URI-References, they must also indicate how to resolve them to absolute URIs.</t>
	  <t>Although anyone may mint a URI to be used as a relation type, it is expected that a few standard types will
		predominate. To facilitate this, <xref target="link-relation-registry"/> establishes an IANA registry of relation types that 
		share a common base URI.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="header.link" title="The Link Header Field">
      <t>The Link entity-header field provides a means for conveying one or more links in HTTP headers. It is 
	semantically equivalent to the &lt;LINK&gt; element in HTML, as well as the atom:link feed-level element 
	in Atom <xref target="RFC4287" />. </t>

      <figure>
        <artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
    Link           = "Link" ":" #link-value  
    link-value     = "<" URI-Reference ">" *( ";" link-param ) )
    link-param     = ( ( "rel" "=" relation-type )
                   | ( "rev" "=" relation-type )
                   | ( "type" "=" type-name )
                   | ( "title" "=" quoted-string )
                   | ( link-extension ) )    
    link-extension = token [ "=" ( token | quoted-string ) ]
    relation-type  = URI-Reference |
                   <"> URI-Reference *( SP URI-Reference) <">
    ]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>For example:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
    Link: <http://example.com/TheBook/chapter2>; rel="previous";
          title="previous chapter"
]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>indicates that chapter2 is previous to this resource in a logical navigation path.</t>

	  <t>Each link-value conveys one target URI inside angle brackets ("<>"). If it is relative, it MUST be
		resolved as per <xref target="RFC3986"/>. Note that because it is conveyed in a header, base URIs from
		content are not applied to it.</t>

  	  <t>The context of links conveyed in the Link header field is the representation that the header is part of.</t>

      <t>Each link-value MUST have at least one "rel" or "rev" parameter whose value indicates the
        relation type. If the "rel" parameter is used, it indicates that the link's direction for
        that relation type is outbound; if the "rev" parameter is used, the given relation type's
        direction is inbound.</t>
		
	  <t>If the relation-type is a relative URI, its base URI MUST be considered to be
        "http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/", and the corresponding value MUST be present in the link
        relation registry.</t>

      <t>Relation-types that include a semicolon (";") or comma (",") MUST be quoted.</t>

      <t>The title parameter MAY be used to label the destination of a link such that it can be used
        as identification within a human-readable menu.</t>

      <t>Note that link-values may contain multiple relations; for example</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
    Link: <http://example.org/>; rel="index start";
          rel="http://example.net/relation/other";
          rev=copyright
]]></artwork>
      </figure>
	<t>Here, the link "http://example.org/" has outbound links of the types "http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/index", "http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/start", and "http://example.net/relation/other", as well as an inbound link of type "http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/copyright".</t>

      <section title="Link Relation Type Registry" anchor="link-relation-registry">
		<t>This specification establishes the Link Relation Type Registry, located at
		<eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/"/>, and updates Atom
		<xref target="RFC4287" /> to refer to it in place of the "Registry of Link Relations".</t>
		
        <t>The semantics of relation types is described in <xref target="link-relationship-types"/>. This registry
		is intended to contain widely-used, standard relation types so that they may be used in "short form" (i.e., 
		as a relative URI) in applications that allow this.</t>
		
		<t>Registered relation types have an implicit base URI of 
			<eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/"/>, and their name SHOULD be limited to the

		<t>Names that differ only in case (e.g., "Foo" and "foo") MUST NOT be registered.</t>

        <t>New relation types can be registered by IETF Review, as outlined in <xref
            target="RFC5226" />. Specifications of new values should use the following

    <section title="Notes on Using the Link Header with HTML">
      <t>HTML motivated the original syntax of the Link header, and many of the design decisions in
        this document are driven by a desire to stay compatible with these uses.</t>

      <t>In HTML4, the link element can be mapped to links as specified here by using the "href"
        attribute for the target URI, and "rel" and rev" to convey both the relation type and its
        direction, as in the Link header. The context of the link is generally the entire HTML
        document.</t>

      <t>All of the link relations defined by HTML4 have been included in the link relation
        registry, so they can be used without modification. However, extension link relations work
        differently in HTML4 and the Link header; the former uses a document-wide "profile" URI to
        scope the relations, while the latter allows the use of full URIs on individual relations.</t>

      <t>Therefore, when using the profile mechanism in HTML4, it is necessary to map the profiled
        link relations to URIs when expressed in Link headers. For example, in HTML:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork xml:space="preserve">
<![CDATA[
<html>
  <head profile="http://example.com/profile1/">
    <link rel="foo" href="/foo">
  </head>
  [...]
]]>
</artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>could be represented as a header like this;</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork xml:space="preserve">
Link: &lt;/foo&gt;; rel="http://example.com/profile1/foo"
</artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>Profile authors should note this when creating profile URIs; it may be desirable to use
        URIs that end in a delimiter (e.g., "/" or "#"), to make extracting the specific relation in
        use easier.</t>

      <t>HTML defines link relation values as case-insensitive, while the Link header's syntax does
        not. Therefore, it is important to case-normalise relation values in HTML before comparing
        or converting them to Link headers.</t>

      <t>HTML also defines several attributes on links that are not explicitly defined by the Link
        header. Although most of these are believed to be defunct, they can be used as
        link-extensions.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Notes on Using the Link Header with Atom">
      <t>Atom conveys links in the atom:link element, with the "href" attribute indicating the target
        URI and the "rel" attribute containing the relation type. The context of the link is either
        a feed or an entry, depending on where it appears; generally, feed-level links are candidates
		for transmission as a Link header. Since atom:link only specifies "rel",
        only outbound links are allowed by non-extended Atom syntax.</t>

      <t>When serialising an atom:link into a Link header, it is necessary to convert IRIs (if used)
        to URIs. Additionally, since the base URI for link relations in Link headers is fixed,
        extension relation types (i.e,. those not in the registry) must be represented as absolute URIs.</t>

      <t>Note also that while the Link header allows multiple relations to be associated with a
        single link, atom:link does not. In this case, a single link-value may map to several
        atom:link elements.</t>

      <t>As with HTML, atom:link defines some attributes that are not explicitly mirrored in the
        Link header syntax, but they may also be used as link-extensions.</t>

    <section title="Acknowledgements">
      <t>This specification lifts the idea and definition for the Link header from RFC2068; credit
        for it belongs entirely to the authors of and contributors to that document. The link
        relation registrations themselves are sourced from several documents; see the applicable
        references.</t>

      <t>The author would like to thank the many people who commented upon, encouraged and gave
        feedback to this draft, especially including Frank Ellermann and Julian Reschke.</t>
