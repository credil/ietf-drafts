Internet-Draft      A Generalized PAC for Kerberos V5      December 2010


1.  Introduction

   There is an increasing need today for Kerberos to support the
   delivery and processing of authorization information pertaining to
   the principals seeking access to the servers.  Kerberos today is used
   extensively for authentication to directory services within the
   Enterprise.  In many cases, a directory service is implemented as a
   distributed database system organized across multiple realms.  As
   such, when a client in one realm seeks access to a directory service
   component located within a different realm, information regarding
   both the identity of the client and the permissions associated with
   that client must be communicated across the realms.  Currently there
   does not exist a common and standardized structure in Kerberos (V5)
   for conveying access control or authorization information.

   This draft proposes a general authorization structure for Kerberos
   that identifies a base set of common data elements or fields within
   the authorization structure, as well as the format of that structure.
   We refer to this data strcuture as the Principal Authorization Data
   (PAD) structure in order to distinguish it from existing structures,
   such as the Privilege Attribute Certificate defined by Microsoft in
   [MS-PAC].


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Use-Case: Cross-Realm Directory Services

   In this section we discuss one of the primary use-case scenarios for
   the Principal Authorization Data (PAD) structure within Kerberos V5.
   In this use-case a client principal is seeking to access a service in
   a different realm.  Since the remote service does not have
   authorization information regarding the client, it needs to obtain it
   either from querying the directory service in its own realm or the
   directory service located in the client's realm.  It is here that a
   common PAD structure becomes necessary and invaluable in order to
   achieve a high-degree of interoperability between directory services
   in distinct realms.

   In this use-case a client principal C1 in realm R1 is seeking access
   to services (or servers) located in a different realm R2.  In
   accessing local service S1 in realm R1 the client must first be
   authenticated by KDC1 in that realm.  A directory service (e.g.

   LDAP) called D1 is used in realm R1 to perform authorization of the
   client, after the client has been authenticated by KDC1.

   When the client prinicipal later seeks to access services or
   resources S2 in realm R2, following the usual Kerberos flow the
   client must first obtain a cross-realm TGT from KDC1 (in realm R1)
   and then present it to KDC2 (in realm R2) in order to obtain a
   service-ticket for S2.  However, one immediate issue is the fact that
   service S2 does not have authorization information regarding the
   permissions or privileges of client C1 in realm R1.  The service S2
   could query its own directory service D2 to obtain authorization
   information pertaining to client C1.  In the absence of such
   information in D2, the service S2 could then perform a cross-realm
   query to the directory services D1 operating in realm R1.

   However, this cross-realm query from S2 to D1 is not only
   inefficient, but it also implies knowledge of multiple eterogenous
   systems by all actors.  Two different realms may rely on completely
   different infrastructures for user information storage, ranging from
   different LDAP implementations with different schema conventions to
   NIS, SQL databases, flat files, and so on.  Every service in the
   realm R2 would have to know what information system is in use in R1,
   how to reach it, how to read and eventually how to map data from it.
   Moreover security related aspects on the authentication of S2 by the
   directory D1, the authorization of S2 to make such a query, the
   protection of responses from D1 to S2, and so on, would have to be
   addressed.

   This use-case illustrates the need for a common PAD structure to
   address this cross-realm authorization problem.  In particular, the
   PAD structure for the cross-realm access to remote services needs to
   be contained or carried within cross-realm TGTs and service-tickets.
   Such a PAD structure needs to carry enough authorization information
   such that a decision can be made by service D2 in realm R2 regarding
   the access request originating from the client principal C1 within
   realm R1.


4.  A Generalized Authorization Structure for Kerberos V5

4.1.  Attributes

   The following attributes are defined in this document:

   o  PAD-Realm

   o  PAD-Principal

Internet-Draft      A Generalized PAC for Kerberos V5      December 2010


   o  PAD-Domain

   o  PAD-Domain-UUID

   o  PAD-Posix-Username

   o  PAD-Posix-UID

   o  PAD-Posix-GID

   o  PAD-Posix-Gecos

   o  PAD-Posix-Homedir

   o  PAD-Posix-Shell

   o  PAD-Fullname

   o  PAD-AlternateNames

   o  PAD-Groups

   o  PAD-MappedDomain-UUID

   o  PAD-Mapped-UID

   o  PAD-Mapped-GID

   o  PAD-Mapped-Attributes

   o  PAD-Mapped-Groups

   These are each defined and discussed further below

4.2.  PAD-Realm

   The full Realm Name of the Realm the principal belongs to.

4.3.  PAD-Principal

   The name of the principal.  Joined with the PAD-Realm component it
   MUST match the full principal name of the owner of the ticket.

4.4.  PAD-Domain

   A short domain name that uniquely identifies, within the set of
   trusted realms, the domain the principal belongs to.  The short
   Domain name is useful for representation purposes in the OS.

Internet-Draft      A Generalized PAC for Kerberos V5      December 2010


4.5.  PAD-Domain-UUID

   A UUID that universally identifies the domain the following local
   identifiers belongs to.  This is used to differentiate between local
   identifiers belonging to different domains/realms.

4.6.  PAD-Posix-Username

   This is the user name that correspond to the kerberos principal, this
   is the name that SHOULD be used by the OS to represent the user.  The
   OS may decide to prefix or posfix this name with the PAD-Domain or
   PAD-Realm names in case of name conflicts with local accounts.

4.7.  PAD-Posix-UID

   This is the UID Number associated to the user.  This number is local
   to the domain identified by PAD-Domain-UUID.

4.8.  PAD-Posix-GID

   This is the Primary GID Number associated to the user.  This number
   is local to the domain identified by PAD-Domain-UUID.

4.9.  PAD-Posix-Gecos

   The Gecos field for the User associated to the Principal if
   available.  Can be omitted.  If not available PAD-Fullname can be
   used instead.

4.10.  PAD-Posix-Homedir

   The home directory path relative to the local system, if available.
   If not available local defined defaults apply.

4.11.  PAD-Posix-Shell

   The default shell for the user, defined as the path of the binary
   relative to the local filesystem, if available.  If not available
   local defined defaults apply.

4.12.  PAD-Fullname

   The full name of the user if available.

4.13.  PAD-AlternateNames

   Alternate names can be used by application to identify a user by
   means that differ from the user principal.  Names are in string form



Sorce, et al.             Expires June 20, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      A Generalized PAC for Kerberos V5      December 2010


   and utf8 encoded [UTF-8].  In order to allow applications to
   recognize the name type without guesswork, alternate names are
   prefixed with a string followed by the colon ':' character and the
   name, without any space or other separation character.  The following
   Alternate names are currently recognized: EMAIL, OS, OPENID, OAUTH It
   is allowed to include multiple alternate names of the same type.  The
   order in which they are provided represent the priority within the
   same name type, if applications need to choose between names.

   (TODO: need discussion on whether these needs labeled prefixes or
   explicit attributes for each alternate representation etc...)

4.14.  PAD-Groups

   This is a structured attribute and defines the groups the principal
   is member of.

   The first value in the structure represents the Domain-UUID and is
   optional.  If missing the Domain UUID is assumed to be the one
   defined in the PAD-Domain-UUID attribute.

   Then an array of values that define the groups as follows.  Each
   group value includes 2 subvalues:

   o  (1) GID: This is the gid number of the group.

   o  (2) Name: This is the name of the group.

   Multiple PAD-Groups attributes can be present at the same time.  A
   trusting KDC can augment the original user's set of groups by adding
   a new PAD-Groups structure that contains groups local to the trusting
   domain.  In this case the Domain-UUID is required.  The Domain UUID
   is used for gid number conflict resolution when the PAC is
   transmitted between services of different realms.

   PAD-Groups are optional attributes and the KDC, upon PAC
   revalidation, may decide to remove the original attributes that do
   not belong to the KDC security domain in order to save space or to
   censor information to avoid disclosing data to services.

4.15.  PAD-MappedDomain-UUID

   UUID of the domain local identifiers belong to, after mapping from
   the original domain.  (NB.  Needs better explanation and discussion)

Internet-Draft      A Generalized PAC for Kerberos V5      December 2010


4.16.  PAD-Mapped-UID

   The value to be used instead of PAD-Posix-UID, and local to PAD-
   MappedDomain-UUID

4.17.  PAD-Mapped-GID

   The value to be used instead of PAD-Posix-GID, and local to PAD-
   MappedDomain-UUID.

4.18.  PAD-Mapped-Attributes

   In POSIX, users and groups ID are not universally unique, and
   different Realms (even different machines within an authorization
   realm actually) may have overlapping and conflicting IDs.  If this is
   the case, a trusting KDC may decide to re-map IDs coming from a
   foreign Realm to help services with uid/gid mapping and avoid ID
   conflicts that can lead to serious security issues.  The original IDs
   are generally preserved.

   If PAD-MappedDomain-UUID is recognized by the application to be the
   local security domain identifier, then only the mapped attributes
   SHOULD be used for authorization purposes and the original values
   SHOULD be ignored.

4.19.  PAD-Mapped-Groups

   The mapped groups to be used instead of PAD-Groups, the structure
   definition is the same as that of PAD-Groups.


5.  Encoding

   The Kerberos protocol is defined in [RFC4120] using Abstract Syntax
   Notation One (ASN.1) [X680].  As such, this specification also uses
   the ASN.1 syntax for specifying both the abstract layout of the PAD
   attributes, as well as their encodings.

5.1.  PAD Format

   The information carried in the PAD need to be augment by some control
   information and packaged in a way that makes it possible to devise
   future extensions.

   Additional information needed to validate the PAD:

   o  The expiration time (must be the same as the ticket expiration
      time).



Sorce, et al.             Expires June 20, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      A Generalized PAC for Kerberos V5      December 2010


   o  The principal name (must be the same principal that owns the
      ticket).

   o  The KDC signature (for re-validation purposes).

   o  The Service Signature (in order to trust the PAD has not been
      tampered with).

   This information is needed to validate the PAD and make sure it is
   not modified, outdated, or information belonging to a different
   principal.

   In order to make the PAD extensible and at the same time always
   verifiable we propose that the PAD is embedded in a ASN.1 structure
   that can contain multiple optional buffers identified by numbers (how
   to assign numbers TBD).

   Buffer number 0 is an ASN.1 strcture that includes all attributes
   described in paragraph 4.  This buffer is itself optional.

   The whole structure with all its buffers is what is signed with the
   KDC and the service keys.

   The final structure to be included in AD-IF-RELEVANT container and
   looks loosely like the following diagram.

   service can use to perform authorization operations.

   The KDC signature is required to allow the KDC to validate the data
   withouth having to recompute the contents at every TGS request.

   The SVC signature is required so that the Service can verify that the
   authorization data has been validated by the KDC.

   The ad-type for AD-SIGNED-PAD is (X).

6.2.  GSS-API Authenticator Extension

   The Authenticator Checksum as defined in RFC 4121 limit the size of
   delegated credentials in the KRB_CRED message to a size of 64KiB.

   In order to be able to transfer larger messgaes an extension is
   defined.  This extension is used in stead of the Dlght/Deleg fields,
   and the Dlght and Deleg fileds MUST not be included when this
   extensions is appended to the authenticator.


    The extension SHALL have the following format:

       Octet        Name      Description
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
       0..1         ExtN    A 16bit value identifying the extension.
                            Represented in little-endian order;
                            Contains the hex value XX XX (XXXX).

       2..5         Length  The length of the Extended Delegation field.
                            Represented in little-endian order;

       6..N         Data    A KRB_CRED message (N = Length + 6)



   A new flag GSS_C_EXT_DELEG_FLAG with Value X is also defined.  This
   flag is used instead of GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG when the delegated
   credentials are larger then 64KiB and cannot fit in the starndard

   Implementors SHOULD use this Extensions and this flag only if the
   KRB_CRED message is larger than 64KiB and use the standard Deleg
   field otherwise.

9.  Security Considerations

   Although it is anticipated that the PAD structure itself will be
   carried within a ticket and thereby protected using the existing
   encryption methods on that ticket, there are a number of issues that
   have bearings on the security of the entire Kerberos realm as whole.
   Some of these issues are as follows:

   o  UID and GUID Collisions: There is always the possibilty of
      collison of numbers repressing a UID and a GID.  This problem can
      be remedied to a large degree by realsm using an appropriate
      number selection policy and algorithms.

   o  Transit-domain issues: The PAC must be signed by the KDC that is
      attaching it to a ticket with 2 different signatures.  The service
      signature so that the service can verify its KDC validated the
      contents.  The KDC signature, so that the OS can ask the KDC to
      confirm the PAD has not been modified by a less trusted service.
      For cross-realm tickets the "service" signature is made with the
      cross-realm key.  When a KDC receives a PAD it is allowed to
      modify it in any way.  It can filter out information or add
      information (like group memberships defined locally).  A KDC may
      also decide to change information in different ways depending on
      what service it is targeted to.
