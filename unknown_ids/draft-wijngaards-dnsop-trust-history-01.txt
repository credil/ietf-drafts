Abstract

   When DNS validators have trusted keys, but have been offline for a
   longer period, key rollover will fail and they are stuck with stale
   trust anchors.  History service allows validators to query for older

   DNSKEY RRsets and pick up the rollover trail where they left off.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC [RFC4034] validators that have been offline or have missed an
   (emergency) rollover can use trust history service to get back on
   track.  The trust history location is assumed available from the
   validator configuration.  The validator then fetches old DNSKEY
   RRsets and checks they form a chain to the latest key.

   Providers of trust history can fetch the DNSKEY data as published by
   the zone they track, and copy-and-paste it.  They need not sign nor
   hold private keys safe.  The algorithms for this are explained below.

2.  Trust History Lookup

   The algorithm is in steps.  The TALINK RR type is defined below.

   Step 1.  The validator performs a DNSKEY lookup to the target zone,
   which looks like any other initial DNSKEY lookup for a trust anchor.
   If the keyset verifies with the trust anchor currently held, the
   keyset already works.  Otherwise, store this result, the further
   algorithm either ends with this result or fails.

   Step 2.  Fetch the trust history list end points.  Query type TALINK
   to the location configured for trust history.

   Step 3.  Go backwards through the trust history list.  Verify that
   the keyset validly signs the next keyset.  This is [RFC4034]
   validation, but the RRSIG expiration date is ignored.  Replace the
   owner domain name with the target zone name for verification.  One of
   the keys that signs the next keyset MUST have the SEP bit set.  Query
   type TALINK to get previous and next locations.

   If all SEP keys have the REVOKE flag set at this step, and the keyset
   is signed by all SEP keys, then continue but store that the end
   result is that the trust point is deleted, see Section 5 [RFC5011].

   If all SEP keys are of an unknown algorithm at this step, continue
   and at the next step, when you verify if the keyset signs validly: if
   false, continue with result a failure, if true, continue with the end
   result that the trust point is deleted.

   Step 4.  When the trust anchor currently held by the validator
   verifies the keyset, the algorithm is done.  The validator SHOULD
   store the result on stable storage.  Use the new trust anchor for
   validation (if using [RFC5011], put it in state VALID).

3.  Trust History Tracker

   The tracker polls the target zone DNSKEY RRset regularly.  Ignore
   date changes in the RRSIG.  Ignore changes to keys with no SEP flag.

   Copy the newly polled DNSKEY RRset and RRSIGs, change the owner name
   to a new name at the history location.  Publish the new RRset and
   TALINK records to make it the last element in the list.

   The list is stored as the DNS Resource Record type TALINK (decimal
   TBD).  The rdata consists of two domain names.  The first name is the
   start, or previous name, and the other name the end or next name in
   the list.  The empty label '.' is used at the endpoints of the list.

   The presentation format is the two domain names.  The wire encoding
   is the two domain names, with no compression so the type can be
   treated according to [RFC3597].  The list is a double linked list,
   because this empowers low memory hosts to perform consistency checks.

4.  Example

   In this example tuhi.example.com provides trust history for
   example.net.  The DNSKEY rdata and RRSIG rdata is omitted for
   brevity, it is a copy and paste of the data from example.net.

5.  Security Considerations

   The trust history tracker only provides a cached copy of old data.
   The history data can be altered or withheld; the lookup algorithm
   then fails.

   The security depends on the key that the validator is holding, and
   the keys in the chain up to the present.  If the old key held by the
   validator is too old, the validator MAY not accept this risk, and
   then SHOULD perform out of band key priming.

   If a validator is also using RFC5011 for the target zone, then the
   trust history algorithm SHOULD only be invoked if the last RFC5011
   successful probe was more than 30 days ago.  If a new key has been
   announced, invoke the history if no 2 probes succeeded during the add
   hold-down time and there was no successful probe after the add hold-
   down time passed.  Therefore the time of the last successful probe
   MUST be stored on stable storage.

   The algorithm looks up the initial DNSKEY like other validators do,
   and then walks the history in reverse.  This avoids exposing the
   validator on the network as a host with an older key and the key id.

   The SEP bit is checked to make sure that control over the KSK is
   necessary to change the keyset for the target zone.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Resource record type TALINK should refer to this RFC, it has RR type
   number TBD (decimal) [by dnsext expert review].
