             The Unicode code points and IDNA - Unicode 6.0
                     draft-faltstrom-5892bis-04.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies IETF consensus for IDNA derived character
   properties related to the three code points, existing in Unicode 5.2,
   that changed property values when version 6.0 was released.  The
   consensus is that no update is needed to RFC 5892 based on the
   changes made in Unicode 6.0.

Internet-Draft               IDNA Codepoints                  March 2011


1.  Introduction

   RFC 5892 [RFC5892] specifies an algorithm that was defined when The
   Unicode Standard [Unicode5.2] was the current version of Unicode, and
   it defines a derived property value.  Unicode 6.0 has changed
   GeneralCategory of three code points that where allocated in Unicode
   5.2 or earlier.  This imply the derived property value differs
   depending on whether the property definitions used are from Unicode
   5.2 or 6.0.

   The three code points are:

1.1.  U+0CF1 KANNADA SIGN JIHVAMULIYA

   The GeneralCategory for this character changes from So to Lo.  This
   implies that the derived property value changes from DISALLOWED to
   PVALID.

1.2.  U+0CF2 KANNADA SIGN UPADHMANIYA

   The GeneralCategory for this character changes from So to Lo.  This
   implies that the derived property value changes from DISALLOWED to
   PVALID.

1.3.  U+19DA NEW TAI LUE THAM DIGIT ONE

   The GeneralCategory for this character changes from Nd to No.  This
   implies that the derived property value changes from PVALID to
   DISALLOWED.


2.  IETF Consensus

   No change to RFC 5892 is needed based on the changes made in Unicode
   6.0.

   This consensus does not imply that no changes will be made to RFC
   5892 for all future updates of The Unicode Standard.

   This RFC is being produced because 6.0 is the first version of
   Unicode to be released since IDNA2008 was published.


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is to update the derived property value registry according to
   RFC 5892 and property values as defined in The Unicode Standard
   version 6.0.

4.  Security Considerations

   When the algorithm presented in RFC 5892 is applied using the
   property definitions of Unicode Standard Version 6.0, the result will
   be different from when it is applied using the property definitions
   of Unicode 5.2 for the three code points discussed in this document
   in addition to the changes for code points being unassigned in
   Unicode 5.2.  The three code points are unlikely to occur in
   internationalized domain names, however, so the security implications
   of the changes are minor.

   The main contributors are (in alphabetical order) Eric Brunner-
   Williams, Vint Cerf, Tina Dam, Martin Duerst, John Klensin, Mark
   Davis, Pete Resnick, Markus Scherer, Andrew Sullivan, Kenneth
   Whistler and Nicholas Williams.

   Not all contributors believe the solution for the issues discussed in
   this document is optimal.
