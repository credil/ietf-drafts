		<section title='Objective'>
			<t>
				The objective of this document is to establish a terminology framework and to provide the operational requirements, which can be used by different Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authorities who are considering establishing trust relationships with each other.
				The document defines different types of possible trust relationships, identifies design and implementation considerations that PKIs should implement to facilitate trust relationships across PKIs, and identifies issues that should be considered when implementing trust relationships.
				
				This document defines terminology and interoperability requirements for multi-domain PKIs from one perspective. A PKI domain can achieve multi-domain PKI interoperability by complying with the requirements in this document. However, there are other ways to define and realize multi-domain PKI interoperability.

				The following terms are used throughout this document.
				Where possible, definitions found in <xref target="RFC4949">RFC 4949</xref> have been used.
			</t>


			<list style='hanging'>
				<t hangText="Certificate:">
					A digitally signed data structure that attests to the binding of a system entity's identity to a public key value.
					(based on definition of public-key certificate in <xref target="RFC4949">RFC 4949</xref>)
				</t>

				<t hangText="Certificate Policy:">
					A named set of rules that indicates the applicability of a certificate to a particular community and/or class of application with common security requirements. (<xref target="CCITT.X509.2000">X.509</xref>)
					Note that to avoid confusion, this document uses the terminology "Certificate Policy Document" to refer to the document that defines the rules, and "Policy Object Identifier (OID)" to specify a particular rule set.
				</t>

				<t hangText="Certificate Policy Document:">
					A document that defines the rules for the issuance and management of certificates and identifies Policy Object Identifiers (OID(s)) for these rules.
					A Certificate Policy Document may define more than one Policy OID.
				</t>

				<t hangText="Policy Object Identifier (Policy OID):">
					An identifier applied to a set of rules governing the issuance and management of certificates.
					Policy OIDs are defined in Certificate Policy Documents.
				</t>

				<t hangText="Certification Authority (CA):">
					An entity that issues certificates (especially X.509 certificates) and vouches for the binding between the data items in a certificate. (<xref target="RFC4949">RFC 4949</xref>)
				</t>

				<t hangText="End Entity (EE):">
					 A system entity that is the subject of a certificate and that is using, or is permitted and able to use, the matching private key only for a purpose or purposes other than signing a certificate; i.e., an entity that is not a CA. (<xref target="RFC4949">RFC 4949</xref>)

					A system entity that depends on the validity of information (such as another entity's public key value) provided by a certificate. (from <xref target="RFC4949">RFC 4949</xref> definition of certificate user)
				</t>

		<section title='Relationships Between Certification Authorities'>
			<t>CAs establish trust relationships by issuing certificates to other CAs.
			CA relationships are divided into <xref target="RFC4949">'certification hierarchy'</xref> and <xref target="RFC4949">'cross-certification'</xref>. </t>

			<t>In a certification hierarchy, there are two types of CAs, superior CA and 'subordinate CA' as described in <xref target="RFC4949">RFC 4949</xref>.  

				<list style='hanging'>
					<t hangText="Superior CA:">
						A CA which is an issuer of a subordinate CA certificate.
					</t>
				</list>

			<t>A cross-certification can be either unilateral or bilateral.

				<list style='hanging'>
					<t hangText="Unilateral cross-certification:">
						Cross-certification of one CA (CA1) by another CA (CA2) but no cross-certification of CA2 by CA1.

				<t>There are two types of hierarchical relationships, depending on whether a subordinate CA certificate or a unilateral cross-certificate is used.  
				In the case where one (superior) CA issues a subordinate CA certificate to another, the CA at the top of the hierarchy, which must itself have a self-signed certificate, is called a Root CA.
				In the case where one CA issues unilateral cross-certificates to other CAs, the CA issuing unilateral cross-certificates is called a Unifying CA.
				Unifying CAs use only unilateral cross-certificates.

				

					<t>NOTE: In this document, the definition of Root CA is according to the second definition (context for hierarchical PKI) of 'root CA' in <xref target="RFC4949">RFC 4949</xref>.  This document uses the terminology 'Trust Anchor CA' for the first definition (context for PKI) of 'Root CA' in RFC 4949.</t>

					A cross-certificate from the Principal CA of one PKI to the Principal CA of another PKI indicates a mapping between one or more policies of the first PKI and one or more policies of the second PKI.

					As shown in <xref target='fig_participation' />, PKI2 is a member of both PKI Domain 1 and PKI Domain 2.
					Since a certification path exists from PKI1 to PKI2, and from PKI2 to PKI3, a certification path also exists from PKI1 to PKI3.
					However, PKI1 does not share domain membership with PKI3, so the certification path validation from PKI1 to PKI3 with a validation policy for PKI Domain 1 must not succeed.  To ensure correct certification path validation and policy mapping, the cross-certificates issued by both PKI1 and PKI3 to PKI2 must contain constraints such as policy mapping or name constraints disallowing the validation of certification paths outside their respective domains.
				</t>

				<t>
					To fully prevent inadvertent trust, any PKI that is a member of one or more PKI Domains must inform all those PKI Domains of its membership in all other PKI Domains.
					In addition, that PKI must inform all those PKI Domains of which it is a member, any time its membership status changes with regards to any other PKI Domain.
					If a PKI Domain is informed of the change in status of one of its member PKIs with regards to other PKI Domains, that PKI Domain must review the constraints in any cross-certificate issued to that PKI.
					If the change in membership would result in a change to the allowed or disallowed certification paths, the PKI Domain must ensure that all such cross-certificates are revoked and re-issued with correct constraints.

					In the Unifying Trust Point Model, a PKI Domain is created by establishing a joint superior CA that issues unilateral cross-certificates to each PKI Domain, as shown in <xref target='fig_unifying_model' />.
					Such a joint superior CA is defined as a Unifying CA, and the Principal CAs in each PKI Domain have the hierarchical CA relationship with that Unifying CA.
					In this model, any relying party from any of the PKI Domains must specify the Unifying CA as its trust anchor CA in order to validate a subscriber in the other PKI Domains.
					If the relying party does not desire to validate subscribers in other PKI Domains, the relying party may continue to use the Principal CA from the old PKI Domain as its trust anchor CA.

					Creating a Local Trust List is the simplest method for relying parties to trust EE certificates.
					Using Local Trust Lists does not require cross-certification between the PKI that issued the relying party's own certificate and the PKI that issued the EE's certificate.
					Nor does it require implementing mechanisms for processing complex certification paths, as all CAs in a path can be included in the Local Trust List.
					As a result, Local Trust Lists are the most common model in use today.  However, because Local Trust Lists are created and managed independently by each Relying Party, the use of Local Trust Lists can be difficult for an enterprise to manage.

					A Trust Authority may be operated by a PKI, a collection of relying parties that share a common set of users, an enterprise on behalf of all of its relying parties, or an independent entity.
					Although PKIs generally establish trust relationships through cross-certificates, a PKI may choose to provide a Trust Authority to support relying parties that do not support processing of certification paths.
					A collection of relying parties that share a common set of users may choose to maintain a single Trust Authority to simplify the management of Trust Lists.
					An enterprise may choose to provide a Trust Authority to implement enterprise policies and direct all Relying Parties within the enterprise to use its Trust Authority.
					Finally, an independent entity may choose to operate a Trust Authority as a managed service.

					A PKI should publish its Certificate Policy Document so that Relying Parties and Trust Authorities can determine what, if any, warranties are provided by the PKI regarding reliance on EE certificates.
				</t>

						</t>
						<t>
							Reviewing the Certificate Policy Document of each PKI to ensure any requirements imposed on Relying Parties are met;
						</t>
						<t>
							Determining if the PKI provides any warranties regarding reliance on EE certificates, and if these warranties are acceptable for the intended reliance on the EE certificates.

						<t>
							Periodically reviewing information published by the PKI to its repository, including Certificate Policy Document updates or notice of CA revocation or compromise.

					A PKI can choose to join or leave PKI Domains in accordance with its Certificate Policy Document.

		<t>
			This section highlights security considerations related to establishing PKI Domains.
		</t>

		<section title="PKI Domain Models">
			<t>
				For all PKI Domain models described in <xref target="pkiDomainModels">Section 3.3</xref> created through the issuance of cross-certificates, standard threats including message insertion, modification, and man-in-the-middle are not applicable, because all information created by CAs, including policy mapping and constraints, is digitally signed by the CA generating the cross-certificate.
			</t>

			<t>
				Verifying that a given certificate was issued by a member of a PKI Domain may be a time-critical determination.
				If cross-certificates and revocation status information cannot be obtained in a timely manner, a denial of service may be experienced by the end entity.
				In situations where such verification is critical, caching of cross-certificates and revocation status information may be warranted.
			</t>

			<t>
				An additional security consideration for PKI Domains is creating inadvertent trust relationships, which can occur if a single PKI is a member of multiple PKI Domains.
				See <xref target="pkiDomainMembershipNotification">Section 3.2.3</xref> for a discussion of creating inadvertent trust relationships and mechanisms to prevent it.
			</t>

			<t>
				Finally, members of PKI Domains must participate in domain governance, or at a minimum, be informed anytime a PKI joins or leaves the domain, so that domain members can make appropriate decisions for maintaining their own membership in the domain or choosing to restrict or deny trust in the new member PKI.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Trust List Models">
			<t>
				In these models, many standard attacks are not applicable since certificates are digitally signed.
				Additional security considerations apply when trust is created through a trust list.
			</t>

			<t>
				A variation of the modification attack is possible in trust list models.
				If an attacker is able to add or remove CAs from the relying party or trust authority trust list, the attacker can affect which certificates will or will not be accepted.
				To prevent this attack, access to trust lists must be adequately protected against unauthorized modification.
				This protection is especially important for trust anchors that are used by multiple applications, as it is a key vulnerability of this model.
				This attack may result in unauthorized usage if a CA is added to a trust list, or denial of service if a CA is removed from a trust list.
			</t>

			<t>
				For trust authority models, a denial of service attack is also possible if the application cannot obtain timely information from the trust anchor.
				Applications should specify service-level agreements with trust authority.
				In addition, applications may choose to locally cache the list of CAs maintained by the trust authority as a backup in the event that the trust anchor's repository (e.g., Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory) is not available.
