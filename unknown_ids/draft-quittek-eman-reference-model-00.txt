1.  Introduction

   Managing energy consumption of devices with network connections is
   different to several well understood network management functions
   because of the special nature of energy consumption.

   One particular difference, for example, is that in many typical cases
   energy consumption is not measured by the consumer itself, but by a
   power meter located somewhere in the power distribution tree, for
   example, at a power distribution unit (PDU).  The PDU measures the
   energy consumption for attached devices and may report this to an
   energy management system.  Different to many other management
   functions, the energy consumer is not involved in this process.

   This memo aims at clarifying roles of entities involved in energy
   monitoring and control and the relationships between these entities.

   There is already a system model defined in section 4 of
   [I-D.claise-power-management-arch].  The intention of this memo is to
   refine this model based on recent discussions on the mailing list.

   The system model specification below describes several kinds of
   entities and interactions between them.  According to the current
   scope of the EMAN WG, only interactions with the energy management
   system are potenial subjects of standardization in this WG.


2.  Terminology

   This section defines terms used for the description of the energy
   management reference model.  Names for entities of the model are not
   defined here but in Section 3.

2.1.  Energy Management

   Energy management deals with assessing and influencing the
   consumption of energy in a network of energy consumers.  A typical
   objective of energy management is reducing the energy consumption in
   the network.  This objective may conflict with other objectives of a
   general network management system, for example, with service level
   objectives.

2.2.  Power, Energy, and Energy Consumption

   Power is a rate of energy conversion.  The energy conversion that is
   typically subject of energy management is called energy consumption.
   Electrical energy is delivered to a device that "consumes" it by
   converting the energy.

   Power is a rate of energy conversion.  In scenarios relevant to
   energy management electrical energy is delivered to a device that
   "consumes" it by converting the energy.

   Power and consumed energy are essential quantities for network
   management.  Power can be an instantaneous value of the current
   energy conversion rate or an average value of instantaneous power
   over a time interval.  Consumed energy, is the total energy converted
   by a consumer during a time interval.

   The term 'energy consumption' is commonly used for both, for
   referring to the amount of consumed energy and also for referring to
   the process of consuming energy.  In the first case it addresses
   consumed energy, in the second one it addresses power, typically an
   average power.  In this document we use this ambiguous term for
   addressing both, power and consumed energy.

   The often used term 'power consumption' is not used here because
   'consumption of an energy conversion rate' is not a concept that is
   considered technically useful for energy management.


3.  Energy Management Entities

   This section defines entities of the energy managemet reference
   model.  Interactions between them are defined in Section 4.  Examples
   scenarios are illustrated in Section 5.  The following figure gives
   an overview of all entities and their interactions.

   [IEEE-802.3af] switch acting as power sourcing equipment may contains
   a power source, a power supply controller, an energy consumption
   meter, and an energy consumption reporter.  It may even integrate an
   additional energy consumption controller.  In such a case, these
   entities may not be modeled separately by an implementation
   interaction between the entities may be entirely internal to the
   device.  In an extreme case, a self-managed device may integrate all
   entities (incduding the energy management system) except the power
   source.

3.1.  Energy Consumer

   An energy consumer is provided with energy, typically with electrical
   energy.  Typically, energy is provided via power lines.  The power
   and consumed energy of energy consumers are subject to monitoring and
   control functions of energy management.

3.2.  Power Source

   A power source provides consumers with electrical energy, typically
   via a power line.  It may have means to switch on and off the power
   supply for the energy consumer.  It's function may be controlled by a
   power supply controller.  A power supply does tyically not not
   generate power.  It may be as simple as a power switch or a power
   plug.

3.3.  Energy Consumption Meter

   An energy consumption meter measures power and consumed energy.
   Typically, it is electrically connected to power provisioning lines
   for energy consumers.  It may store energy consumption information
   and process it, for example, for extracting statistics that are
   provided to the energy consumption reporter

3.4.  Energy Consumption Reporter

   An energy consumption reporter has access to information on energy
   consumption of energy consumers and is able to report this
   information to energy management systems.  For getting information on
   energy consumption it may interact with an energy consumption meter.

   The energy consumption reporter may also provide information on
   identity and properties of an energy consumer to the management
   system.  An energy consumption reporter may store energy consumption
   information and process it, for example, for extracting statistics
   that are provided to the management system.

Internet-Draft    Reference Model for Energy Management    November 2010


3.5.  Power Controller

   A power controller has means for controlling the energy consumption
   of a energy consumer by communication with it in order to control its
   current power (energy consumption rate).

3.6.  Power Provisioning Controller

   A power provisioning controller has means for influencing the power
   supply of an energy consumer.  Typically, it has means for switching
   power supply on and off.  It may use these means without
   communicating with the affected energy consumer.

3.7.  Energy Consumption Controller

   An energy consumption controller is a power controlller, or a power
   provisioning controller, or a combination of both.

3.8.  Energy Management System

   An energy management system interacts with energy consumption
   reporters and energy consumption controllers in order to achieve
   objectives of energy management.  It receives reports on energy
   consumption from energy consumption reporters and sends commands to
   energy consumption controllers.

   An energy management system may be centralized and consist of a
   single component only.  It also can be distributed and contain
   several interacting components.  In most of the example scenarios
   illustrated in Section 5 a centralized energy management system is
   shown.  For all examples this can be replaced by a distributed
   management system.


4.  Interactions between Energy Management  Entities

   This section describes the set of potential interactions between
   entities of the energy management reference model.  Examples of these
   interactions are illustrated in Section 5.

   Potential subjects of standardization in the EMAN working group are
   only interactions of the energy management system with other entities
   as described in section Section 4.1.  Other interactions described in
   Section 4.2 are not subject of standardization according to the EMAN
   charter.  However, describing them is useful for understanding the
   interactions in which the management system is involved.

4.1.  Interactions of the Energy Management System

   The energy management system interacts with energy consumption
   reporters and energy consumption controllers.

4.1.1.  Interactions with Energy Consumption Reporters

   The energy management system receives reports about energy
   consumption from energy consumption controllers.  Reports may contain
   power and consumed energy of one or more energy consumers and further
   related information, for example, an identification of the consumer
   on which energy consumption is reported or statistics of energy
   consumption and power states.

   It is argued in [I-D.quittek-power-monitoring-requirements] that the
   best choice of management protocols for this purpose is SNMP
   [RFC3410].  For the reference model defined in this memo we assume
   that SNMP is the protocol used between energy management system and
   enenergy consumption reporter.  However, the model would also be
   valid if other protocols were used, for example push-based protocols
   such as Syslog [RFC5675] and IPFIX [RFC5101].

4.1.2.  Interactions with Energy Consumption Controllers

   The energy management system sends commands to energy consumption
   controllers concerning energy consumers.  Commands to power
   provisioning controllers concern power provisioning of the affected
   consumer.  Typically, just two commands are used: "power on" and
   "power off".  But also a reduction of supplied power, for example
   "reduce voltage" may be sent as command.  Commands to power
   controllers concern the power state of the energy consumer.  A
   typical example is a command to bring an energy consumer into a sleep
   state or to wake it up from a sleep state.

   There are several choices for the protocol to be used for these
   interactions.  Among them are SNMP [RFC3410] and NETCONF [RFC4741].

4.2.  Other Interactions Between Entities

   Interactions described in this section do not involve the energy
   management system and are not subject of standardization according to
   the EMAN charter.  However, their description is useful to fully
   understand the interactions of the energy management system.

   This reference model does not make any assumption on the
   communication means used for these interactions.  The involved
   entities may be located within the same device, inegrated into a
   single monolithic implementation, and use any kind of internal

Internet-Draft    Reference Model for Energy Management    November 2010


   communication.  Alternatively they may be located remote of each
   other and use IP or any other protocol to communicate.

4.2.1.  Energy Consumption Reporters and Energy Consumption Meters

   Energy consumption reporters interact with energy consumption meters
   in order to receive power consumption information.  If they are
   remote of each other, then the energy consumption reporter acts as
   relay and potentially also as protocol converter and storage for
   measured data.

4.2.2.  Power Controllers and Energy Consumers

   Power controllers interact with energy consumers in order to send
   them power state change commands.

4.2.3.  Power Provisioning Controllers and Power Sources

   Power provisioning controllers interact with power sources in order
   to send them commands regarding the power supply for energy
   consumers, such as switchin power on or off.


5.  Energy Management Scenarios

   This section describes a few example scenarios for energy management
   and how they are modeled with the entities and interactions described
   in the previous sections.

5.1.  Simple Device equipped with Energy Consumption Meter

   A very basic example is an energy consumer that has a built-in meter
   for measuring its own energy consumption.

5.3.  External Energy Consumption Meter

   In this example, an energy consumption meter is attached to the power
   line of an energy consumer that does not have means for measuring
   enrgy consumption by itself.

5.4.  Power over Ethernet Switch

   This example shows a Power over Ethernet (PoE) [IEEE-802.3af] switch
   supplying an energy consumer.  The switch contains a power source for
   PoE, a controller for this power that can be controlled by the energy
   management system and it contains a meter for each port and a
   reporter for reporting measured energy consumption data.  Please note
   although there may be multiple instances of power sources and energy
   consumption meters in the switch, only single instances are show.
   The same applies to the energy consumers that arde represented by a
   single one only.

   +---------+                                          +----------+

   A problem of this example is the identification of energy consumers.
   A basic PoE switch does not know which kind of device is attached to
   a port.  But it can observe MAC and IP address of the energy
   consumers and report them to the energy management system which then
   in turn can contact the consumer to obtain further information.

5.5.  Power Distribution Unit

   The same figure as used for the PoE switch in the previous section
   can be used for modeling a power distribution unit (PDU).  The PDU
   receives commands from a management system to switch on and off power
   at certain sockets.  It contains meters for every socket and can
   report power for each of them.

   The problem of identifying the energy consumers for is more difficult
   than in the previous case of the PoE switch, because the PDU does not
   communicate with the energy consumers and only reports energy
   consumption per socket.  In this case the network management needs to
   obtain this information by other means, for example by manual
   configuration.

5.6.  Energy Consumption Reporting Proxy

   This example deals with measuring energy consumption of devices that
   do not necessarily have IP connectivity, but other means of
   communicating with a proxy.  The proxy acts as relay and protocol
   converter in order to deliver the energy consumption information to
   the network management system.

   +---------+                                    +--------------------+

   Here again, the problem of identifying the energy consumer has become
   very difficult, because neither can the energy consumption reporter
   provide an IP address of the energy consumer to the energy management
   system nor can the energy management system directy communicate with
   the energy consumer.  Identification must be provided by other means.
   The Proxy can have a gateway function and relay identification
   between energy consumer and energy management system or the energy
   management system needs to acquire information on energy consumers by
   other means, such as manual configuration.

5.7.  Energy-Aware Consumer

   Last but not least, this example shows a consumer that is energy-
   aware.  It monitors and controls its own energy consumption and for
   this purpose contains a portion of a distributed energy management
   system.  The energy management function contained in the energy-aware
   device may still have some interaction with other components of the
   management system, for example for distributing policies that
   determine the bahavior of self-management functions.  But these
   interactions between components of the distributed energy management
   system are not shown here.
