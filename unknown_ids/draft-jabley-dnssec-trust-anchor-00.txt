           DNSSEC Trust Anchor Publication for the Root Zone
                  draft-jabley-dnssec-trust-anchor-00

Abstract

   The root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS) has been
   cryptographically signed using DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).

   In order to obtain secure answers from the root zone of the DNS using
   DNSSEC a client must configure a suitable trust anchor.  This
   document describes how such trust anchors are published.

Internet-Draft     Root Zone Trust Anchor Publication     September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].
   Security extensions to the DNS (DNSSEC) are described in [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034] and [RFC4035].

   A discussion of operational practices relating to DNSSEC can be found
   in [RFC4641].

   In DNSSEC a secure response to a query is one which is
   cryptographically signed and validated.  An individual signature is
   validated by following a chain of signatures to a key which is
   trusted for some extra-protocol reason.

   The publication of trust anchors for the root zone of the DNS is an
   IANA function performed by ICANN.  A detailed description of
   corresponding key management practices can be found in [DPS], which
   can be retrieved from the IANA Repository located at
   <https://www.iana.org/dnssec/>.

   This document describes the distribution of DNSSEC trust anchors.
   Whilst the data formats and the publication and retrieval methods
   described in this document might well be adapted for other uses, this
   document's focus is more specific and is concerned only with the
   distribution of trust anchors for the root zone.

2.  Root Zone Trust Anchor Publication

   Trust anchors for the root zone are published in two formats:

   o  as the hash of the corresponding DNSKEYs consistent with the
      defined presentation format of Delegation Signer (DS) resource
      records [RFC4034], contained within an XML document, as described
      in Section 2.1, and

   o  as Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) in PKCS#10 format [RFC2986]
      for further processing by Certification Authorities and validation
      of proof of possession of the corresponding private keys, as
      described in Section 2.2.

   Both formats are described in this document.

2.1.  XML

   Trust anchors are published in an XML document whose schema is
   described in Appendix A.  The document contains a complete set of
   trust anchors for the root zone, including anchors suitable for
   immediate use and also historical data.

   Examples of trust anchors packaged and signed for publication can be
   found in Appendix B.

2.2.  Certificate Signing Request (PKCS#10)

   To facilitate signing the trust anchor by a public key
   infrastructure, trust anchors are also published as Certificate
   Signing Requests (CSRs) in PKCS#10 format [RFC2986].

   Each CSR will have a Subject with following attributes:

   O: the string "ICANN".

   OU:  the string "IANA".

   CN:  the string "Root Zone KSK" followed by the time and date of key
      generation in the format specified in [RFC3339], e.g.  "Root Zone
      KSK 2010-06-16T21:19:24+00:00".

   resourceRecord:  the hash of the public key consistent with the
      presentation format of the Delegation Signer (DS) [RFC4034]
      resource record (see Appendix C for attribute definition).

3.  Root Zone Trust Anchor Retrieval

3.1.  HTTP

   Trust anchors are available for retrieval using HTTP [RFC2616].

   The URL for retrieving the CSR is
   <http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/key-label.csr>, with "key-label"
   replaced by the key label of the corresponding KSK.

   The URL for retrieving the IANA-signed Certificate is
   <http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/key-label.crt>, with "key-label"
   again replaced as described above.

   The URL for retrieving the complete trust anchor set is
   <http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml>.

   The URL for a detached S/MIME signature for the current trust anchor
   set is <http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.p7s>.

   The URL for a detached OpenPGP [RFC4880] signature for the current
   trust anchor set is
   <http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.asc>.

3.2.  HTTP Over TLS

   Trust anchors are available for retrieval using HTTP over TLS
   [RFC2818].

   The URLs specified in Section 3.1 are also available using HTTPS.
   That is:

   The URL for retrieving the CSR is
   <https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/key-label.csr>, with "key-label"
   replaced by the key label of the corresponding KSK.

   The URL for retrieving the IANA-signed Certificate is
   <https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/key-label.crt>, with "key-label"
   again replaced as described above.

   The URL for retrieving the complete trust anchor set is
   <https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml>.

   The URL for a detached S/MIME signature for the complete trust anchor
   set is <https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.p7s>.

   The URL for a detached OpenPGP [RFC4880] signature for the current
   trust anchor set is

Internet-Draft     Root Zone Trust Anchor Publication     September 2010


   <https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.asc>.

3.3.  Signature Verification

   The OpenPGP [RFC4880] keys used to sign trust anchor documents carry
   signatures from personal keys of staff who are able to personally
   attest to their validity.  Those staff members will continue to make
   their personal keys freely available for examination by third
   parties, e.g. by way of PGP key parties at operator and IETF
   meetings.  In this fashion a diverse set of paths through the PGP web
   of trust will be maintained to the trust anchor PGP keys.

   An OpenPGP keyring containing public keys pertinent to signature
   verification is published at
   <http://data.iana.org/root-anchors/icann.pgp>.  The public keys on
   that keyring will also be distributed widely, e.g. to public PGP key
   servers.

   Certificates used to create S/MIME signatures will be signed by a
   Certificate Authority (CA) administered by ICANN as the IANA
   functions operator and also optionally by well-known (e.g.  WebTrust-
   certified) CAs to facilitate signature validation with widely-
   available X.509 trust anchors.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Key Signing Key (KSK) management for the root zone is an IANA
   function.  This document describes an initial set of publication
   mechanisms for trust anchors related to that management.  In the
   future, additional publication schemes may be also be made available,
   in which case they will be described in a new document which updates
   this one.

   Existing mechanisms will not be deprecated without very strong
   technical justification.

   This document contains information about an existing service, and has
   no IANA actions.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes how DNSSEC trust anchors for the root zone of
   the DNS are published.  It is to be expected that many DNSSEC clients
   will only configure a single trust anchor to perform validation, and
   that the trust anchor they use will be that of the root zone.  As a
   consequence, reliable publication of trust anchors is important.

   This document aims to specify carefully the means by which such trust
   anchors are published, as an aid to the formats and retrieval methods
   described here being integrated usefully into user environments.

Appendix D.  Historical Note

   The first KSK for use in the root zone of the DNS was generated at a
   key ceremony at an ICANN Key Management Facility (KMF) in Culpeper,
   Virginia, USA on 2010-06-16.  This key entered production during a
   second key ceremony held at an ICANN KMF in El Segundo, California,
   USA on 2010-07-12.  The resulting trust anchor was first published on
   2010-07-15.
