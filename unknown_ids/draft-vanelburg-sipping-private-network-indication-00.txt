Abstract

   This document describes why a private network indication is needed.
   A private network indication allows other nodes in a network to treat
   private network traffic to a different set of rules then public
   network traffic.  The indication also distinguishes one private
   network from another private network.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  General

   ETSI TISPAN defines Next Generation Networks (NGN) which uses the
   3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS (IP Multimedia
   Subsystem) which in turn uses SIP (RFC3261 [2]) as its main
   signalling protocol.  (For more information on the IMS, a detailed
   description can be found in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5] and 3GPP TS 24.229
   [6].)

1.2.  Business communication

   In the context of its work on business communiction support in public
   next generation networks (NGN), ETSI TISPAN has identified a
   framework [4] for the support of business communication capabilities
   by the NGN.  As well as the direct attachment of Next Generation
   Corporate Network (NGCN) equipment, this includes the capability to
   "host" functionality relating to the enterprise network within the
   NGN itself.

   These hosting arrangements are:
   a)  virtual leased line, where NGCN sites are interconnected through
       the NGN;
   b)  business trunking application, where the NGN hosts transit
       capabilities between NGCN's, break-in capabilities from NGN to
       NGCN and break-out capabilities from NGCN to NGN; and
   c)  hosted enterprise services, where an NGN hosts originating and/or
       terminating business communication capabilities for business
       communication users that are directly attached to an NGN.

   ETSI TISPAN has requirements that can be met by the introduction of
   an explicit indication for private network traffic.

   The traffic generated or received by an NGN on behalf of a private
   network can be either:
   o  public network traffic: traffic sent to the NGN for processing
      according to normal rules of the NGN.  This type of traffic is
      known as public network traffic;
   o  private network traffic: traffic sent to the NGN for processing
      according to an agreed set of rules specific to an enterprise.
      This type of traffic is known as private network traffic.  Private
      network traffic is normally within a single enterprise, but
      private network traffic can also exist between two different
      enterprises if not precluded for regulatory reasons.

Internet-Draft         private network indication          February 2008


1.3.  Indication types

   A private network indication as proposed by this document should not
   be confused with an indication to the local user that the remote user
   is in the same private network.  This has traditionally resulted in
   PBXs providing distinctive ringing on incoming calls, but has also
   been used as input to services provided to the end user, e.g.
   different forwarding conditions and so on.  Traditionally, this has
   only been applied where the call does not enter the public network at
   all, but we regard that limitation as a technical limitation rather
   than as one precluded by the desires of the service (i.e.
   traditionally there has been no special indication of this and it has
   relied on calling line identity, and for calls coming in over the
   public network, one would both need reliable transfer of calling line
   identity, and the authentication that it really was that calling line
   identity, as the end user would not like a false indication that this
   is a private network internal call when it is in fact someone wishing
   to use that indication for fraudulent purposes.  There may be a need
   for such a explicit indication, but that is not covered by this
   document.

   Rather private network indication as proposed by this document is an
   indication to each and every network element traversed that this is
   private network traffic as opposed to public network traffic.  This
   indication is not for the end user on the private network.  It is an
   indication that special service arrangements apply for an enterprise,
   and therefore it is an indication of service on behalf of an
   enterprise, not an indication of service to an end private network
   (NGCN) user.

   In order to allow NGN IMS nodes to perform different processing ETSI
   TISPAN formulated the following requirements on NGN:
   1.  The NGN shall distinguish public network traffic from private
       network traffic.
   2.  The NGN shall distinguish private network traffic belonging to
       one enterprise from that belonging to another enterprise.

   To sumarize a few example reasons for a public telecommunication
   network to make the distinction between the two types of traffic:
   o  Different regulations apply to the two types of traffic, most
      notably lawfull intercept regquirements.  Another example is
      emergency calls may be handled differently depending on the type
      of traffic.
   o  Different charging regimes may apply.
   o  Call recording for business reasons (e.g. quality control,
      training, non-repudiation) might apply only to a specific type of
      traffic.




van Elburg & Drage       Expires August 21, 2008                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         private network indication          February 2008


   o  Different levels of signalling and/or media transparency may apply
      to the different types of traffic.

   The indication is not regarded as appropriate as an indication from
   the end UA attached to an NGCN or hosted enterprise service equipment
   in the NGN.  In this case any mixture of traffic relates to two or
   more distinct users, one belonging to the enterprise network and
   receiving service from that enterprise network, and one belonging to
   the NGN and receiving service from that network.  Any distinction
   between the traffic to such a UA should be based on the
   authentication arrangements performed with each of the service
   networks.

   There are several reasons why there is a need for an explicit
   indication in the signalling:
   1.  As calling and target addresses can not in all cases be used to
       determine whether a certain call is to be treated as private or
       public network traffic.
   2.  Separate nodes in the network need to be able to act on the type
       of traffic being handled, when implicit schemes would be used it
       would require distribution of such enterprise specific logic over
       multiple nodes of multiple operators.  That is clearly not a
       manageable architecture.
   3.  There may be cases where treating the call as a public network
       call allthough both participants are from the same enterprise is
       advantegous to the enterprise.

   Given the above background this document will formulate requirements
   on SIP for support of an explicit private network indicator.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].


3.  Definitions

3.1.  Public Network Traffic

   Traffic sent to or received from a public telecommunication network
   for processing according to the normal rules.

Internet-Draft         private network indication          February 2008


3.2.  Private Network Traffic

   Traffic sent to or received from an public telecommunication network
   for processing according to an agreed set of rules specific to an
   enterprise or a community of closely related enterprises.

3.3.  Trust Domain

   The term Trust Domain in this document is taken from RFC3324 [3].  In
   the context of this document it is assumed that a trust domain for
   the purpose of private network indication contains the same set of
   SIP nodes as the trust domain for the purpose of network asserted
   identity.


4.  Requirements

   This section lists the requirements on SIP derived from consideration
   in Section 1:
   R1:  It is REQUIRED that an indication can be send in SIP initial
        requests for a dialog or SIP standalone requests and or SIP
        responses to those that indicate that the request or associated
        session is to be treated according to the rules of private
        network traffic.
   R2:  The indication from R1 can be inserted by a SIP proxy belonging
        to an administrative entity where for onward routeing, the
        traffic within that administrative entity needs to be so
        distinguished.  The indication is not needed where the traffic
        is assumed to be all public, or where the traffic is assumed to
        be all private.
   R3:  The indication from R1 can be removed by a SIP proxy belonging
        to an administrative entity where for onward routeing, the
        traffic no longer needs to be so distinguished.  An example
        exists where the traffic reaches an NGCN site where the traffic
        is now assumed to all private network traffic.
   R4:  It is REQUIRED that the indication from R1 allows entities to
        determine the set of rules that are applicable, these rules may
        be enterprise specific.
   R5:  It is REQUIRED that the indication from R1 allows entities
        receiving it to distinguish private network traffic from
        different enterprises.
   R6:  This distinction R5 of traffic belonging to one private network
        can be inserted by SIP proxies where for administrative reasons
        it becomes important.  This insertion may be by a different
        entity to that which inserted the indicator between private
        network traffic.  For example, an NGCN site inserts the
        indicator to distinguish public network traffic from private
        network traffic, but all private network traffic belongs to this



van Elburg & Drage       Expires August 21, 2008                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         private network indication          February 2008


        enterprise so an explicit indication to distinguish the traffic
        from that belonging to other enterprises is not needed.  However
        the request is then routed to the NGN, which is handling private
        network traffic relating to multiple enterprises, so an
        additional identifier needs to be added at this time.
   R7:  The identifier to distinguish private network traffic belonging
        to one enterprise from that belonging to another enterprise must
        be globally unique.  Business communication arrangements for any
        particular enterprise can be expected to span multiple NGN
        operators potentially in multiple countries.
   R8:  The indication from R1 relates primarily to the SIP signaling.
        There may be an association of the concent with media, but only
        where the limitations of such an association can be applied due
        to the potential different routeing of media.


5.  Potential Solutions

5.1.  General

   It would be technical possible, but extremely complex to perform this
   function without an explicit indication.  For example, a logical
   distinction of proxies to handle private network traffic relating to
   enterprise 1, enterprise 2 and the public network traffic could be
   made by assigning different SIP URIs to these logical entities.  This
   is not regarded as a viable solution.

   Several solutions have been raised and whether or not they are
   suitable and fulfill the requirements need to be discussed:
   o  Attribute on existing header?
   o  Token on some existing header?
   o  Resource-Priority header?
   o  P-Asserted-Service header?
   o  Request-Disposition header?
   o  P-Access-Network-Information header?
   o  URI parameter?
   o  New P-header?
   o  New header?

5.2.  Attribute on existing header

5.3.  Token value on existing header

5.4.  Resource-Priority header

   Some of the distinctive functions are already provided for in this
   header.  A potential mechanism would be to define a namespace for
   private network traffic.  It would however be impossible to define a



van Elburg & Drage       Expires August 21, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         private network indication          February 2008


   namespace for each enterprise, and therefore some additional
   parameter would need to be defined to carry the unique identifier of
   the particular enterprise to which the private network traffic
   relates.  Successful usage may also require a tightening of the
   procedures for use of the Resource-Priority header (much at the
   moment is left to the particular application of this header).

5.5.  P-Asserted-Service header

   The services envisaged by the P-Asserted-Service header field
   (draft-drage-sipping-service-identification) are those applied to the
   end user.  The end user in these cases is the end user of the
   enterprise or NGCN, not the enterprise itself.  There fore this
   header is not considered suitable for this problem.

5.6.  Request-Disposition header

   The Request-Disposition header field (RFC3841 [8]) specifies caller
   preferences for how a server should process a request.  The caller in
   these cases is the end user of the enterprise or NGCN, not the
   enterprise itself.  There fore this header is not considered suitable
   for this problem.  Further RFC3841 explicitly states that the set of
   request disposition directives is not extensible.

5.7.  P-Access-Network-Information

   The P-Access-Network-Info header field (RFC3455 [7]) contains
   information about the access network that a UA uses to get IP
   connectivity.  However the access that one uses does not define the
   private network that a call that one sets up is to be part of.

   Particular examples that illustrate this:
   o  A Hosted Enterprise Services user (i.e.  Centrex) uses the access
      of the operator while still being able to setup calls that will
      turn out to be private network traffic.
   o  A corporate network UE that attaches to an operator network, but
      receives services from its home corporate network.

5.8.  New P-header

   Possible usage is more general than that envisaged for a P-header.

5.9.  URI parameter

   A marking on the entities within the Via header that are treating
   this as private network traffic.  Potential marking on the route
   header of entities that are expected to treat it as private network
   traffic.

Internet-Draft         private network indication          February 2008


5.10.  New header?

   If none of the existing headers is appropriate a new header might
   need to be defined.


6.  Security Considerations

   The private network indication being defined in this document is to
   be used in an environment where elements are trusted and where
   attackers are not supposed to have access to the protocol messages
   between those elements.  Traffic protection between network elements
   is sometimes achieved by using IPsec and sometimes by physically
   protecting the network.  In any case, the environment where the
   private network indication will be used ensures the integrity and the
   confidentiality of the contents of this header field.

   A private network indication received from an untrusted node MUST NOT
   be used and the information MUST be removed from a request or
   response before it is forwarded to entities in the trust domain.

   There is a security risk if a private network indication is allowed
   to propagate out of the trust domain where it was generated.  In that
   case sensitive information would be revealed by such a breach.  To
   prevent such a breach from happening: Proxies MUST NOT insert the
   information when forwarding requests to a next hop located outside
   the trust domain.  When forwarding the request to a trusted node,
   proxies MUST NOT insert the header unless they have sufficient
   knowledge that the route set includes another proxy in the trust
   domain that understands the header, such as the own proxy.  There is
   no automatic mechanism to learn the support for this specification.
   Proxies MUST remove the information when forwarding requests to
   untrusted nodes or when the proxy does not have knowledge of any
   other proxy in the route set that is able to understand the header.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA in the ... registry under the ... subregistry.
