Internet-Draft network configuration problem statement    November 2009


   With the network evolution to all IP, the network configuration needs
   to be enhanced because of large number of network devices and service
   tunnels.

   The existing IP network management mainly depends on manual
   configuration. The cost will be very high if all these work are
   performed manually and it is a great burden for service providers to
   deploy and maintain such large scale IP networks.

   This document discusses problems related to reducing network
   configuration workload and transmission tunnel setup between network
   devices and NMS (Network Management System).

1. Introduction

   The mobile network and the fixed network are evolving towards ALL IP
   network. Therefore, the number of IP network devices increases
   rapidly. Following this, constructing IP network will take a lot of
   efforts due to the large number of network devices.

   Several issues of configuration in the existing network constructing
   should be considered:

   o It takes a lot of work to design the configuration scripts for the
      large amount of network devices, which will often bring occasional
      mistakes.

   o The address and link of some IP network devices cannot be acquired.
      So the network topology often changes from what is planned, and
      the pre-designed configuration scripts of the network devices need
      to be changed in network deployment phase.

   o Without DCN connection, the initial configuration scripts can only
      be input locally or use MODEM/CF cards, which involve large amount
      of manual work.

   o The manual work cannot avoid mistakes which will cause failure of
      network.

   This document provides two problem statements related to large
   network configuration workload.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

3. Configuration problems

   With the network evolution to all IP, the network configuration needs
   to be enhanced because of the large scale IP network.

   IP network will have more and more network devices and service
   tunnels. Therefore, constructing an IP network will take a lot of
   effort due to the large number of network devices being configured
   manually.



3.1. Configuration workload in IP network

   In a typical IP network, e.g., LTE IP backhaul network, there will be
   up to 16000 base stations, 20000 network devices and up to 200K
   service tunnels.

   In the existing configuration method, the configuration related work
   includes:

   o The engineer design of the configuration scripts of each device.

   o The arrival time of engineers to the site of network devices.

   o The engineer check of the network devices and links based on
      network planning.

   o Change of the configuration scripts by the engineer when network
      topology changes unexpectedly.

Internet-Draft network configuration problem statement    November 2009


   o The configuration scripts input to the network devices.

   After network is configured and the network device is connected to
   NMS, the service tunnels can be configured from NMS. Configuring
   service tunnel from NMS is already defined which is not included in
   this document.

   The workload of network configuration in this typical scenario is
   estimated and shown in figure 1.

   Figure 1 Workload of network configuration in LTE IP backhaul network

   The workload of arrival time of engineer to the network devices
   occupies 51% of total and configuration design of the device occupies
   33% of total. Instead of local operation, remote operation is
   valuable for device or link check and configuration input to avoid
   manual configuration in the locale. It is also very important to
   reduce the large workload of device design and temporary
   configuration change which takes 33% of all the workload and requires
   senior engineers. The auto configuration based on network topology
   and service model is important to be realized to reduce the
   workload of network configuration.

   Besides the above LTE IP backhaul network scenario, DSLAM or FTTx has
   been the main stream in fixed network infrastructure which brings the
   IP network into the access network edge.

   Both the mobile network and the fixed network are evolving towards
   ALL IP network. Therefore, from the core segment to aggregation and
   till access edge, the number of IP devices increases rapidly.

   The existing IP network management mainly depends on manual
   configuration. It is a great burden for service operators to deploy
   and maintain such large scale IP networks.

3.2. Problems to be solved for network configuration

   To reduce deploy and maintenance workload and cost, it is important
   to bring in automatic and remote configuration mechanism for large
   scale IP network.

   One key goal is Plug & Play: simplicity on site manual configuration
   is required. Once the cable is connected, the IP network devices
   interconnect with each other quickly and get specific configuration
   information from NMS.

   There are some configuration problems to be solved to achieve Plug &
   Play in the commissioning device stage:

   o  Initial configuration of management IP for network device
      management;

   o  How can all IP network devices be connected to each other at IP
      layer so that the management message can reach all the devices
      after the cable is connected?

   o  How can network devices authenticate each other during the
      automatic connection setup process?

   o  Interoperate among different heterogeneous equipments, e.g.
      routers, switches, access gateways and etc

   o  Traversing equipments from different vendors may cause the problem
      that the third party network blocks the Plug & Play of network
      devices

   o  For service providers, the network devices are managed by network
      management system (NMS). It is very difficult to add all the
      device information into the NMS one by one and manually. Some kind
      of auto discovery mechanism is needed to simplify the device
      discovering.


4. Security Considerations

   It is possible that there are security issues with the problems
   stated above, e.g. the tunnel between NMS and network devices needs
   mutual authentication before the tunnel is finally setup.
