Abstract

   The Transport Profile of Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (MPLS-TP) is a packet-based transport technology based on the
   MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Pseudowire (PW) data
   plane architectures applicable in various deployment
   environments.

   This document describes the allocation of an Associated Channel
   Type to support ITU-T defined functions for packet transport
   network (PTN) applications, such as Operations, Administration
   and Maintenance (OAM), and applicable to MPLS-TP Pseudowires
   (PWs), Label Switched Paths (LSPs), Sub-path Maintenance
   Elements (SPMEs) and Sections.

   This document is intended to become a product of a joint
   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International
   Telecommunications Union Telecommunication Standardization
   Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile
   within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network
   as defined by the ITU-T.

Editors' Note:

   This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF
   Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an
   IETF Last Call.

   [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an
   RFC and insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that
   the published RFC has IETF Consensus.]

1. Introduction

   As noted in the multi-protocol label switching (MPLS-TP) Framework
   RFCs (RFC 5921 [5] and [6]), MPLS-TP is a packet-based transport
   technology based on the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and
   Pseudo Wire (PW) data plane architectures defined in RFC 3031 [1],
   RFC 3985 [2] and RFC 5659 [3] applicable in any packet network
   context.

   A subset of MPLS-TP is also applicable to ITU-T-defined packet
   transport networks (PTN), where the transport network operational
   model is deemed attractive.

   When MPLS-TP is deployed in PTN environment, application specific
   mechanisms (e.g., OAM) are required to allow service providers
   retaining the same operational experience in the MPLS-TP network as
   they had in their existing Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous
   Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) and Optical Transport Network (OTN)
   networks.

   When MPLS-TP is deployed in other environments, e.g. in a Packet
   Switched Network (PSN), application specific mechanisms (e.g., OAM)
   are required to allow service providers retaining the same
   operational experience in the MPLS-TP network as they had in their
   existing IP and MPLS networks.

   The standard MPLS-TP toolkit has to serve the interests of both
   communities of users.

   The roadmap for OAM toolset standardization does not meet the
   market needs of some PTN operators and therefore, for the sake
   of satisfying market needs, development of PTN application
   specific functions within ITU-T will allow ITU-T to satisfy the
   immediate needs expressed at the June 2010 Study Group 15
   meeting recognizing that it is very important for ITU-T and IETF
   to provide timely solutions to maintain support for the MPLS-TP
   agreements.

Internet-Draft          ACH codepoint for PTN              January 2011


   Allocation of one Associated Channel Type value will allow ITU-T
   to develop the tools required to address the unique needs of PTN
   application and will make more efficient use of the resources of
   both organizations while providing a mechanism to prevent the
   accidental interconnection between PTN and PSN application
   specific tools. The use of this code point fully complies with
   the framework and architecture for MPLS-TP.

   This document describes the allocation of an Associated Channel
   Type to support ITU-T defined functions for packet transport
   network applications, such as Operations, Administration and
   Maintenance (OAM), and applicable to MPLS-TP Pseudowires (PWs),
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs), Sub-path Maintenance Elements
   (SPMEs) and Sections.

   This document is intended to become a product of a joint
   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International
   Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector
   (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the
   IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and
   functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the
   ITU-T.

1.1. PTN Application Description

   In this application MPLS-TP will be used to add packet transport
   capability to an existing circuit switched (SDH/OTN) transport
   network.  Note that in many such networks Ethernet technology has
   been deployed to address some of these needs, also that Ethernet is
   a primary packet transport service.  The primary requirements are
   driven by a desire for compatibility with the existing transport
   network operational processes and in particular compatibility with
   the existing OAM mechanisms.

1.2. Support for multiple applications

   Multiple applications are commonly supported from a single toolkit
   within the MPLS suite of protocols, with extensions that are applied
   to specific applications.

   As a consequence, the MPLS architecture allows multiple protocols to
   perform the same function for different network applications; e.g.

   o  Three different label distribution protocols (LDP, RSVP-TE, BGP)

   o  Two different routing protocols (OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE)

   o  Three different VCCV types

Internet-Draft          ACH codepoint for PTN              January 2011


   For any given application, a subset of protocols are implemented;
   e.g.,

   o  LDP is used for connectionless MPLS,

   o  RSVP-TE is used for connection-oriented MPLS

   o  BGP is used with L2 and L3 VPNs

   There are no MPLS architecture barriers to allowing different
   protocols for network operations in "PTN" and "PSN" applications
   while the operational requirement in these two applications domains
   are sufficiently distinct to justify such an approach.

3. Usage of the Associated Channel Type allocated for PTN

   The usage of the associated channel type allocated for PTN
   applications will fully comply with the MPLS-TP data plane
   architecture and framework as described in RFC 5960 [7], RFC 5586
   [4], RFC 5921 [5] and draft-ietf-mpls-tp-uni-nni [6].

4. Compatibility Considerations

   As described in section 5 of RFC 5586 [4], an LER, LSR or PE that
   are not capable to processing packets on the Associated Channel Type
   allocated for PTN applications discards such packets when all the
   MPLS or PW labels have been popped.

5. Interconnection of PTN and PSN networks

   PTN and PSN networks can be interconnected together. Three scenarios
   for interconnection are described in this section.

5.1. PTN client over a PSN server

   In this case a LSP originates and terminates in a PTN network and
   crosses a PSN network.  The end to end PTN LSP runs as a client over
   the PSN network.  This is illustrated in Figure 1 below.

5.2. PSN client over a PTN server

   In this case a LSP originates and terminates in a PSN network and
   crosses a PTN network.  The end to end PSN LSP runs as a client over
   the PTN network.  This is illustrated in 0 below.

5.3. LSP or PW originating in a PTN network and terminating in a PSN
   network

   In this case the PW (or LSP) originates (or terminates) in a PTN and
   terminates (or originates) in a PSN.  The default OAM for the end to
   end LSP or PW is PSN.  PTN OAM may be supported if the network
   operators mutually agree to select this option.  The default option
   is illustrated in Figure 3 below.
