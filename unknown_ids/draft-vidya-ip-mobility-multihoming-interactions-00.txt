1.  Introduction

   Over the years, several protocols have been defined at the IETF to
   handle changes to IP addresses of endpoints in a seamless fashion and
   preserving communications established using a given IP address across
   changes in the IP points of attachment.  Essentially, all of the
   proposed mechanisms provide IP address permanence at some level to
   layers above.  Some protocols go beyond support for just single-
   interfaced endpoints and allow multi-homing and IP address permanence
   to applications on infrastructure sites, servers, gateways, etc.
   "Permanence" as used here is typically bound by some length of time
   and hence is not quite permanent in the literal sense.  The idea is
   for the IP address, as observed by layers above IP, to stay constant
   within that duration, even if the endpoint changed its IP point of
   attachment or added an interface within that time.  The existing
   documents on these protocols provide sufficient details for the
   individual protocol operation itself, but do not touch on
   architectural aspects.  In practice, a combination of the protocols
   are likely to be deployed in an architecture.  There are various such
   combinations plausible, but some combinations are more realistic than
   others.  Also, various considerations come into play while defining
   an overall architecture that encompasses IP mobility and multi-
   homing.  Often, a network may need to support a variety of such
   protocols to satisfy the varying needs of the different nodes that
   attach to it.  Also, a given node would often support multiple such
   protocols for various reasons.

   This document analyzes the overall mobility architecture and
   highlights some key points to consider while deploying an
   architecture consisting of one or more of these protocols.  The
   protocols considered in scope for this document include Mobile IPv4
   (MIPv4), Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), Fast
   Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6), Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), MOBIKE, Host
   Identity Protocol (HIP), and Shim6.

Internet-Draft  IP Mobility and Multi-homing Interations   February 2007


   IP Mobility

      IP mobility refers to changes in the IP point of attachment of a
      node.  As a consequence of this change, a node may obtain a
      different (topologically meaningful) address.  The result is that
      a mobile node or network, as it moves, may obtain different
      topologically meaningful IP addresses that it can use for IP-based
      communications.  Some protocols allow the nodes to maintain the
      same IP address as they move across different IP points of
      attachment.

   IP Mobility Protocol

      An IP mobility protocol provides transparency to layers above IP
      from the changes in the IP addresses resulting from IP mobility.
      In particular, such protocols allow nodes to continue IP
      communications independent of the current IP point of attachment
      and to preserve established communications across any
      corresponding IP address changes.  A key element of an IP mobility
      protocol is to detect movement and do what is needed to allow
      communication continuity.

   IP Multi-addressing

      A node or a network is multi-addressed when it simultaneously has
      multiple topologically meaningful addresses or prefixes.  Note
      that nodes and networks can be multi-addressed even if they only
      have a single network attachment point.  This is typically true
      for IPv6 nodes for example, since interfaces can have both link-
      local and global addresses.

   IP Multi-homing

      A network is multihomed when it has multiple network (not
      necessarily physical) attachment points.  From an IP perspective,
      these multiple attachment points typically imply that the node or
      network is also multi-addressed.  There are some exceptions,
      however, (e.g., with Provider Independent (PI) addressing), where
      multihoming does not translate to having a meaningful address/
      prefix from each of the providers.  Similarly, a node is
      multihomed when it has multiple network interfaces

   IP Multi-addressing Protocol

      An IP multi-addressing protocol provides transparency to upper
      layers from changes in the IP address actually used to exchange
      packets by presenting a constant IP address.  A key element of an
      IP multi-addressing protocol is to detect the reachability status

      of the different addresses and do what is needed to allow
      communication continuity.

   Node-based Mobility

      Node-based mobility is defined as an IP mobility mechanism where
      the mobility management signaling is performed by the node
      requiring mobility itself.  Mobile nodes include end hosts and
      routers that may be mobile.

   Network-based Mobility

      Network-based mobility is defined as an IP mobility mechanism
      where the mobility management signaling is performed by a network
      entity on behalf of the node requiring mobility itself.

   Local Mobility

      For the purpose of this document, local mobility is defined as
      mobility within a given domain.  Local mobility protocols allow at
      least one IP address of a node to remain constant within the local
      domain.  Continuity of sessions using that IP address in the local
      domain is a goal for these protocols.  The term "domain" is quite
      loosely used to indicate a region within which it is practical to
      expect end-to-end security associations between the mobility
      signaling endpoints.  Typically, this is limited to a single
      administrative domain.  Depending on the protocol used, this may
      mean mobility within an access technology or may also involve
      inter-technology handoffs.

   Global Mobility

      For the purpose of this document, global mobility is defined as
      mobility within a larger geographic area.  Typically, this
      includes mobility across heterogeneous technologies and inter-
      administrative domains.  Global mobility protocols allow at least
      one IP address of a node to remain constant across any handoffs.
      Continuity of sessions using that IP address across handoffs is a
      goal for these protocols.

   Global Roaming

      This term is used to refer to the availability of a set of
      services to a node from anywhere, at any time.  Maintenance of IP
      address or session continuity is not a goal for this.  This term
      encompasses the cases of a node roaming world-wide and accessing a
      set of services from anywhere.

   Correspondent Node

      Any entity that communicates with a mobile node is referred to as
      a correspondent node.

   Access Router

      An Access Router is defined as the first hop IP router for a
      mobile node at its point of attachment.  This entity typically
      serves as the default router for the mobile node.

   Access Network

      An access network is typically the edge network to which a mobile
      node attaches.  An access network typically comprises of one or
      more physical and link layer attachment points, as well as one or
      more access routers.


3.  IP Mobility and Multi-homing - Relative Analysis

   IP mobility and multi-homing are closely related in one sense and
   somewhat different in another sense.  Protocols that handle IP
   mobility and multi-homing can be used together in a competing or
   complementary fashion.  A system looking at using the various
   available components should look at the scope of each and the
   requirements at hand to see how best to fit these together.  This
   section provides an analysis on the relative scope and requirements
   handled by each suite of protocols.

             Figure 1: End Node and Multi-Network Associations

   Figure 1 shows a multi-network setup with local networks, remote
   networks and home networks, all inter-connected in some fashion.  The
   main idea is that these networks can communicate via a backbone of
   some form.  There are three classes of networks illustrated here:

   Local Networks

      A local network is an access network to which a node is attached
      at any given time.  The node may or may not have a long term
      association with that network.  The local network often defines
      the actual IP point of attachment of a node and may change over
      time.

   Home Networks

      A home network is one with which a node has a long term
      association (this is not to be confused with the "home network" in
      the context of Mobile IP or related protocols).  While that is
      certainly one example of a home network, the various provider
      networks in the SHIM6 context may also be home networks from an
      association point of view.  Networks with which a node has a VPN
      relationship may also fall under this category.

Internet-Draft  IP Mobility and Multi-homing Interations   February 2007


   Remote Networks

      A remote network is one with which a node has no association.  A
      remote network may become a local network at some point of time.
      A node with certain local and home networks may communicate with
      any of the networks.  For generality, everything except the local
      and home networks may be viewed as a remote network.

   Given all the networks, there are several mobility, multihoming, and
   multi-addressing relations that can be drawn from here.

   Note that the nodes within a multihomed network will be exposed to
   multiple prefixes and they will then configure multiple global
   topologically meaningful addresses.  The result is that nodes within
   a multihomed network are multi-addressed, as are nodes which are
   themselves multihomed.  Even if the former type of nodes access the
   Internet through a single interface, the use of different addresses
   implies different paths (because each address is associated to a
   different point of attachment of the multihomed network to the
   Internet).  Both types of nodes encounter similar problems and also
   benefit from a multi-addressing support protocol.

   The multihoming aspects may vary due to mobility or due to network
   unreachability.  The former may cause more frequent changes in the
   multihoming state than the latter.  Also, a node may be multihomed
   both in the local and home networks.  For instance, a mobile node
   with cellular and WLAN accesses may be associated with two ISPs or
   with an ISP and an enterprise network.  The local multihoming
   situation may change relatively frequently based on the rate of
   mobility of the node, while the multihoming situation with multiple
   home networks may remain fairly stable.

   Correspondent nodes may be located in the local, home, or remote
   networks.  While it is technically feasible for communication with
   the correspondent node to happen using any of the IP addresses owned
   by the node, there may be some practical considerations with respect
   to making IP address changes known to the correspondent nodes and its
   impact to applications in use.  Using DNS updates or SIP Re-invite
   like mechanisms, IP address changes can be made visible to the
   correspondent nodes.  For some applications, such transitions may be
   seamless enough, while it may not be the case for some other
   applications.

   The alternative to DNS updates or SIP Re-invites and affecting
   applications with IP address changes and reachability issues is to
   provide an unchanging address to the applications and handle actual
   IP address changes at a lower layer.  This is the approach taken by
   IP mobility and multihoming protocols, although in different ways.

Internet-Draft  IP Mobility and Multi-homing Interations   February 2007


   IP mobility protocols achieve this property via tunneling mechanisms.
   A centralized entity keeps track of the current location of the
   mobile node, so that data can be appropriately forwarded to the node.
   IP multihoming protocols like SHIM6 achieve this property via a shim
   layer between the IP and transport layers that perform address
   translation, thereby avoiding tunnels.

   IP mobility protocols developed at the IETF thus far are scoped to
   solve both mobility and multihoming in the context of a single home
   network.  In other words, local multihoming (attachment to multiple
   local networks) is handled by extensions to Mobile IP, for instance.
   This provides seamlessness to the applications using the address of
   the end node associated with one home network for communication.

   IP multihoming protocols developed at the IETF thus far are scoped to
   solving site multihoming in the context of one or more local and/or
   home networks.  The main difficulty that multi-addressed nodes face
   when managing their multiple addresses, is that the reachability
   status of the addresses may vary during the lifetime of a
   communication (e.g. because of outages) and it may be required to use
   a different address for continuing an established communication,
   since the original one has become unreachable.  While address
   unavailability and additions may be caused by mobility, solving node
   mobility is not a goal of the protocol.

   Section 6.1.3 provides details on how IP mobility and multihoming
   protocols can be architecturally combined.


4.  Protocol Sub-classes

4.1.  Node-based Mobility and Multihoming

4.1.1.  Mobile IP

   Mobile IP (v4 and v6) provides a mechanism by which a node can
   maintain the same IP address as it changes its IP point of
   attachment.  This is enabled by having a Home Address which is on the
   prefix of a Home Agent and a Care-of-Address which is the
   topologically correct local address at the point of attachment.  The
   Home Agent maintains the mapping between the Home Address and the
   Care-of-Address.  The Mobile Node is responsible for updating the
   binding between the Home Address and Care-of-Address at the Home
   Agent.  All packets sent to the Home Address of the mobile node will
   be received by the Home Agent and tunneled or forwarded to the mobile
   node at its Care-of-Address.  The packets sent from the mobile node
   may be sent directly or reverse tunneled through the Home Agent.

Internet-Draft  IP Mobility and Multi-homing Interations   February 2007


   Mobile IPv4 (MIP4) additionally provides a mode of operation with a
   Foreign Agent in the local network.  The Foreign Agent makes
   conservation of IP space possible by allowing multiple mobile nodes
   on its link to share the same Care-of-Address.  The Care-of-Address
   in this case is the IP address of the Foreign Agent.  The Mobile IP
   tunnel in this case terminates at the Foreign Agent and the Foreign
   Agent forwards packets to the mobile node based on the Home Address
   in the packets.

   Mobile IPv6 (MIP6) additionally provides the capability of route
   optimization.  Here, the mobile node may provide the Home Address-
   Care-of-Address binding to a correspondent node (CN) so that the CN
   sends packets directly to the Care-of-Address bypassing the Home
   Agent.

   Mobile routers may be supported using Network Mobility (NEMO), where,
   in addition to a Home Address, a prefix owned by the node is also
   bound to the Care-of-Address at the Home Agent or CN.

   Multi-homing for the Care-of-Addresses may be supported in MIP6 using
   extensions being defined in [2].  This allows multiple Care-of-
   Addresses for an mobile node to be bound to a given Home Address.
   There are extensions being proposed to use multiple Care-of-Addresses
   simultaneously based on flow mapping information, for instance.  One
   Care-of-Address is registered as a primary Care-of-Address and is
   used by default.  Multiple Care-of-Addresses are also supported in
   MIP4 (simultaneous bindings), although data is duplicated to every
   Care-of-Address registered.

4.1.2.  Hiearchical Mobile IP

   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) provides a means of local mobility
   management for mobile nodes.  Essentially, it is a variant of MIP6
   that provides more efficient mobility within a local domain.  In this
   case, the mobile node obtains a Regional Care-of-Address (RCoA) in
   the prefix of a Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) and a Local Care-of-
   Address (LCoA) which is the topologically correct IP address at the
   point of attachment.  The mobile node is responsible for updating the
   binding between the LCoA and RCoA at the MAP.  HMIPv6 may be used
   independent of the use of MIP6.

   A variant of HMIP, called regional registration, has been proposed
   for IPv4 as well.  A Generic Foreign Agent is used in place of the
   MAP to hide the local mobility from the Home Agent.  Unlike HMIPv6,
   regional registration relies on the presence of Mobile IP as a higher
   level mobility management protocol in the system.

   In general, all the extensions defined for MIP6 may be used with

   HMIPv6 as well.  Hence, NEMO and multiple Care-of-Address binding
   would also be supported in HMIPv6.

4.1.3.  Fast Mobile IP

   Fast Mobile IP (v4 and v6) provides a means of local mobility
   management at the edge for mobile nodes.  FMIP is designed to provide
   temporary mobility management across Access Routers for faster and
   low latency handoffs.  Here, a previous Care-of-Address (pCoA) is
   bound to a new Care-of-Address (nCoA) at the previous Access Router
   (pAR), after the mobile node has left the pAR and attached itself to
   a new Access Router (nAR).  Effectively, data is tunneled from the
   pAR to the mobile node at its nCoA

   FMIPv4 also supports the Foreign Agents, in keeping with MIP4.

4.1.4.  MOBIKE

   MOBIKE provides mobility and multi-homing capabilities to IKEv2.
   When IKEv2 is used to create IPsec Security Associations between a
   node and a VPN gateway, the node may change its IP point of
   attachment, causing a change to the IP address which was used in
   IKEv2.  Further, the node and the VPN gateway may be multi-homed with
   multiple IP addresses.  MOBIKE allows a node to update its IP address
   on the IKE SA and correspondingly change the IPsec tunnel outer
   addresses.  Hence, a node may change IP addresses without having to
   re-establish the IKE and IPsec SAs.  Packets sent to the tunnel inner
   address of the node are tunneled to the appropriate outer address.

   Since IKEv2 is defined in an IP version agnostic manner, MOBIKE also
   applies equally to IPv4 and IPv6.

4.1.5.  SHIM6

   In order to preserve global routing system scalability, the Site
   Multi-homing by IPv6 Intermediation (Shim6) approach proposes that
   multihomed sites obtain multiple globally routable prefixes, one from
   each of their ISPs.  In this configuration, each prefix assigned to a
   multihomed site can be aggregated into the prefix of the
   correspondent ISP, eliminating the contribution of multihomed sites
   to the global routing table.  The result is that interfaces within
   multihomed sites will configure one address per prefix that is
   available in the site.  In this setup, each address is reachable as
   long the corresponding path is working, so in order to preserve
   established communications through outages, it may be necessary to
   change the address used for exchanging packets during the lifetime of
   the communication.  This is achieved using the Shim6 protocol.

Internet-Draft  IP Mobility and Multi-homing Interations   February 2007


   The Shim6 protocol provides a means by which two nodes with more than
   one IP address pair can change the address used to exchange packets
   during the lifetime of a communication without impacting the
   applications.  Shim6 introduces the concept of an Upper Layer
   Identifier (ULID), and allows the IP address chosen by applications
   to persist, while using different addresses (called locators) to
   actually exchange packets below IP, based on their reachability
   status.  A shim sub-layer located within the IP layer, between the IP
   endpoint sub-layer (handling fragmentation and IPSec functions among
   others) and the IP forwarding sublayer provides this transparency.
   The ULIDs used by Shim6 are in the form of an IPv6 address and
   contain cryptographic information that is used to secure the binding
   between the ULID and its locator set.  The Shim6 architecture has two
   main components.  The Shim6 protocol that is used to create and
   manage the Shim6 context between the endpoints containing ULID pair
   and locator set information for the peers.  The other component is
   the failure detection and alternative path exploration protocol
   (called REAP), that allows the peers to detect failures along the
   currently used path and explore alternative locator pairs to divert
   the communication through.

4.1.6.  HIP

   TBD

4.2.  Network-based Mobility

   Network-based mobility provides a means of mobility management for
   nodes without involving the nodes themselves in the signaling.  This
   is done by making IP mobility transparent to the nodes.  Network-
   based Local Mobility Management (NetLMM) is essentially a concept of
   providing local mobility using network-based mobility management
   protocols.  Here, a Mobility Access Gateway (MAG), often located at
   the Access Router (AR), updates a Local Mobility Agent (LMA) with the
   location of a mobile node.  A mobile node acquires an IP address in
   the NetLMM domain, which remains the same as long as the mobile node
   remains within that domain.  Hence, the changes in the IP point of
   attachment do not cause IP address changes.

   By definition, NetLMM allows an IP prefix to span multiple links.  By
   assigning a unique prefix for every mobile node and by employing
   virtual point-to-point link semantics for link local behavior, it is
   possible to avoid the issues of multi-link subnets [2] in NetLMM.

   Also, by definition, NetLMM provides mobility for a given IP address
   or prefix of a node.  If a node is multi-addressed, mobility for each
   address or prefix will be handled separately in the NetLMM domain.
   While it is feasible to identify the multiple IP addresses or

   prefixes as belonging to the same node using other identifiers, it is
   not possible to provide transparency of such addresses to
   correspondent nodes or applications.

   Figure 2 shows a potential network architecture with various
   components of IP mobility management entities.  The figure follows
   the local, home and remote network models shown in Figure 1.  As
   shown, a part of the local network may be the edge or access network
   to which a node attaches.  The access network typically consists of
   the first hop IP routers that nodes can attach to.  The access
   network also provides the physical point of attachment (wired or
   wireless access with L1/L2 points of attachment such as access
   points) for the nodes.  Depending on the system, there may or may not
   be mobility management elements in the local network.  Also,
   depending on the system, there may not be a home network at all.  For
   completeness, the figure shows the possible IP mobility management
   entities.  All the elements shown are logical elements and some of
   them may be physically collocated in a system.

   As shown in the figure, the Mobility Access Gateway, the Foreign
   Agent, and the Access Router are all elements of an access network.
   The MAG is responsible for playing the role of a network-based
   mobility client.  The Foreign Agent provides MIP4 services and the
   Access Router plays a role for FMIP and HMIP.  In FMIP, the Access
   Router is responsible for handling of edge tunnels upon handoff of a
   node and in HMIP, the Access Router is responsible for advertising
   the MAP in the IPv6 Router Advertisements.  While all these elements
   can technically co-exist in the same access network and in the same
   physical box even, there are some considerations that need to be
   taken into account when these do co-exist.  Such considerations are
   outlined in Section 6.

   When the local network supports mobility management, there may be
   other entities such as a Mobility Anchor Point (MAP), a Local
   Mobility Agent (LMA), a VPN gateway supporting MOBIKE, or even a Home
   Agent present in the local network.  One or more of these may serve a
   node from a mobility management perspective.  Some of these interact
   with some of the elements in the access network to support IP
   mobility for the end node.  As in the case of the access network
   elements, one or more of these logical functions may be present in
   the local network and may be collocated in the same physical entity.
   Some interactions are studied in Section 6.

   When involved in mobility management, a home network may host an Home
   Agent or a VPN Gateway supporting MOBIKE.  Local mobility management
   entities are not expected to be present in a home network.  Note that
   the sub-divisions of local, home and remote network, etc. are with
   respect to the end node - for e.g., a network that is remote for one
   node may be a local network for a different node.

   The end node itself may be multi-homed in a couple of different ways
   - it may have multiple addresses from the home or local network.  The

   node may have multiple interfaces that attach to different access
   networks within the same or different local network.  Further, the
   node may also have connectivity to multiple home networks, as
   discussed in Section 3 - for instance, it may be served by different
   Home Agents or VPN Gateways for access to specific services in each
   home network.  The node may use Shim6 for multi-homing - it may
   correspond with other Shim6 nodes in other networks.  Even though a
   Shim6 node is shown separately in the home and remote networks, any
   of the other entities may also be Shim6 capable.

   One aspect not indicated in the figure is connectivity to the
   "Internet" or other networks.  It can be assumed that any of the
   networks provide connectivity to the Internet.  The home network can
   also be expected to provide connectivity to other networks that offer
   some services to the end node.

5.2.  Protocol Stacks

   With so many IP mobility management protocols, all potentially
   solving slightly different problems, it is interesting to see how
   these fit together in the stack.  The following figure shows the
   stack diagram for the protocols discussed in this document.

                          Figure 3: Stack Diagram

   Figure 3 above shows a stack diagram of how the various IP mobility
   and multihoming components fit in a stack with respect to some other
   layers.  A node may have various link layers as indicated.  The IP
   layer is indicated in three parts.  One is the IP forwarding sublayer
   that sits right above the link layer.  In many of these protocols,
   there may be IP-in-IP tunneling.  This is indicated in the figure by
   "Link (Tunnel)" - this layer would essentially wrap around the IP
   layer as a loopback, as shown.  Typically, IP addressing is done on a
   per-link basis.  Any virtual interfaces/links are assumed to still be
   a separate link.  The Shim6 layer has two possible locations in the
   stack - it may be above or below the "Mobile IP family" of protocols.
   Since the Mobile IP family of protocols (MIP, FMIP, HMIP, PMIP)
   involve mapping between two IP addresses, Shim6 can be invoked as a
   multi-homing solution for either of those addresses.  More about this
   interaction will be described in Section 6.1.3 below.

   The figure shows MIP generically at the IP layer and MIP4
   specifically over the transport layer.  MIP4 signaling runs over UDP,
   while the MIP4 data tunnel is an IP-IP tunnel.  For sake of
   completeness, the figure shows MIP4 signaling also over UDP, for the
   signaling portion.

   The IPsec components (AH and ESP) may either be part of the tunnel
   (shown as a link) or the actual IP layer above the MIP family of
   protocols when IP-in-IP encapsulation (with reverse tunneling) is
   used for the MIP data path.  This depends on which address is used
   for IPsec purposes.  However, it should be noted that MIP6 is
   operated with Route Optimization, the IPsec components are always
   above the MIP components in the header.  IKEv2 (and by definition,
   MOBIKE) run over UDP.  IKEv2/MOBIKE is the signaling mechanism that
   ultimately affects the IPsec tunnel endpoints - hence, as in the case
   of MIP4, it is only the signaling that is layered over a transport
   protocol.

   AH and ESP may also be used in transport or tunnel mode and hence may
   be part of the tunnel or the regular IP layer.  All of the elements
   shown are optional elements and the existence of any of this depends
   on the protocols used in the system.

   any problematic combinations.  This is a work in progress and is
   expected to be more detailed in later versions.

6.1.1.  MIP, HMIP, and FMIP

   Depending on the mobility needs of a system, one or more of these
   protocols may be deployed.  Typically, this is a two level mobility
   management mechanism, with additional edge mobility.  However,
   multiple modes of combining FMIP and HMIP are also feasible.  A few
   different modes of using these protocols together is explained below.
   It should be noted that it is feasible to run any of these modes with
   just a subset of these three protocols.  It should further be noted
   that while this section focuses on the v6 versions of these
   protocols, similar combinations are also feasible with the v4
   versions of the same - there may be additional modes of interest with
   MIP4, given the Foreign Agent mode of operation; however, that is
   left for further study.

   Figure 4 shows an architecture with a MIP Home Agent, an HMIP MAP and
   Access Routers that perform FMIP operation.  Upon first entering the
   network, the mobile node obtains an IP address on the prefix served
   by an Access Router.  Using the MAP advertised by the Access Router,
   the mobile node may perform an HMIP registration, using that IP
   address as its Local Care-of-Address (LCoA) and an IP address
   obtained in the MAP's prefix as its Regional Care-of-Address (RCoA).
   The mobile node may further obtain a Home Address from the Home Agent
   and use that for mobility across MAPs.  In this case, the HMIP RCoA
   is registered as the MIP6 Care-of-Address of the mobile node.  In the
   presence of a Home Address, the mobile node would typically use this
   address for application connectivity.  However, there may be certain
   other considerations in choosing the right address for communication.
   More on that in Section 6.1.1.3.

   It is feasible for one or more of the logical functions to be
   collocated.  For instance, one of the local networks may actually be
   the home network of the mobile node.  In that case, it is feasible
   that the RCoA of the mobile node is the Home Address (due to
   collocation of the MAP and the Home Agent).  Hence, while it is in
   that local network, the mobile node is "home" from a MIP perspective.
   The MIP operation only starts when the mobile node then moves out of
   that local domain.

   The combination of HMIP and FMIP may also be done in a few different
   ways.  When the mobile node moves from one Access Router to another,
   it may use FMIP for faster handoffs.  FMIP may be used within a MAP
   or across MAPs between Access Routers.  It is also feasible to use
   FMIP on the previous MAP, when the mobile node moves across MAP
   boundaries.  This would often be more efficient in such border cases
   than setting up the FMIP session between the Access Routers.  In a
   tree topology, it may always be more efficient to allow the MAP to
   perform FMIP services.  In these cases, the "PAR (Previous Access
   Router)" functionality of FMIP is performed by the MAP.  When the
   mobile node moves across Access Routers within a MAP, the FMIP tunnel
   is set up with the previous and new LCoAs as the FMIP PCoA and NCoA
   respectively.  When the mobile node moves across MAPs and uses FMIP
   on the MAP, the previous and new RCoAs are treated as the FMIP PCoA
   and NCoA respectively.

   The FMIP tunnel is viewed as a temporary, short-lived tunnel used to
   help mobile nodes receive packets while waiting for the HMIP or MIP
   registration to complete.  When FMIP is not in use, such a two-level
   mobility management mechanism leads to two IP tunnels on every data
   packet.  For the period where FMIP is also in use, every packet is
   tunneled thrice.  For a packet sent from the mobile node, this
   tunneling results in something as shown in Figure 5.  The figure
   shows source and destination addresses of each IP header present in

   the packet.  The oringinal packet is sourced using the Home Address
   to a correspondent node.  This is first encapsulated in the Mobile IP
   tunnel, followed by the HMIP tunnel and finally followed by the FMIP
   tunnel.  For a packet received by the mobile node from a CN, the
   tunneling is similar in the reverse direction.

   +---------+---------------+--------------+-------+----------


            Figure 5: Packet Tunneling with MIP, HMIP, and FMIP

   When all the three protocols are in use, this also means that the
   mobile node needs to perform signaling for FMIP and HMIP upon handoff
   within a given local network and for FMIP, HMIP and MIP upon handoff
   across local networks.

6.1.1.1.  Security Implications

   In this model, the mobile node is responsible for all of the
   signaling.  Each protocol requires a specific security association
   that is tied with the address for which the binding needs to be
   created.  This ensures that the mobile node cannot redirect traffic
   meant for some other node.  When all the three protocols are in use,
   this implies that the mobile node shares a Security Association with
   the PAR tied to the PCoA (which is also the HMIP LCoA), a Security
   Association with the MAP tied to the RCoA (which is also the MIP
   Care-of-Address), and a Security Association with the Home Agent tied
   to the Home Address.  Depending on the choice of security protocol
   used by each of these mobility management protocols, these security
   associations may be IPsec security associations or something else.

6.1.1.2.  Multihoming Implications

   The mobile node may be attached to multiple Access Routers, thereby
   having multiple LCoAs.  The mobile node may register multiple LCoAs
   with the MAP in that case.  Further, the mobile node may actually be
   attached to multiple MAPs (if there are overlapping MAP regions as
   described in Section 6.1.1.3), in which case, it possesses multiple
   RCoAs.  The mobile node may then use MIP to register multiple Care-
   of-Addresses (each RCoA would be registered as a MIP Care-of-Address)
   with the Home Agent.

   Multihoming with connectivity to multiple Home Agents is discussed in
   Section 6.1.3.

6.1.1.3.  Other Analysis

   It is important to look at system requirements before determining
   whether all the protocols are needed.  For many practical needs of
   mobile nodes, it is possible that only a subset of these protocols
   are needed.  For instance, both FMIP and HMIP address the latency
   involved in MIP registrations - FMIP allows reception of packets at
   new location before the registration with the Home Agent completes.
   HMIP ensures that the MIP registrations need not be that frequent -
   hence, the latency really comes into play only upon crossing MAP
   boundaries.  If something like FMIP is needed for fast handoff
   purposes anyway, HMIP may not be needed as an intermediate level of
   mobility management.  Depending on the location of the MAP and the
   kind of interconnectivity that is present between the Access Routers,
   it may also be the case that the latency involved in HMIP
   registrations and FMIP tunnel setup are comparable.  In such cases,
   it may be feasible to avoid the use of FMIP in the system.

   The use of HMIP permits a not-so-transient local address (RCoA) that
   can be used for communication.  When there is no need for a really
   long-lived IP address, it may not be necessary to have a global
   mobility management mechanism.  This basically allows the data path
   latency to be lower, since the MAP is meant to be geographically
   closer to the mobile node.  When Route Optimization is used for MIP,
   this data path latency is not an issue.  However, even when Route
   Optimization is used, HMIP is useful to ensure that frequent
   registrations with the correspondent node are not needed.
   Registrations with the correspondent node will need to be modified
   only upon handoff to a new MAP.  In reality, the local network
   regions managed by MAPs is likely to be overlapping, in which case,
   make-before-break HMIP transitions can be made.  This is especially
   feasible with HMIP, since there is no requirement on trust
   relationships between the Access Routers and the MAP.  Once the
   mobile node possesses a security association with the MAP, it can
   register any LCoA with it.  The overlapping MAP boundaries may be
   indicative of a geographically closer MAP, implying a MAP transition
   for more optimal communication.  Such an overlap provides the mobile
   node the opportunity to bootstrap the HMIP session with the new MAP
   before switching the data path to it.  However, this places a
   requirement on the mobile node to be able to handle multiple HMIP
   sessions simultaneously for a short period of time.  It must be noted
   that an overlap is harder for inter-administrative domains, since
   even though there is no trust relationship requirement between the
   Access Routers and the MAPs, the Access Routers are required to
   advertise the presence of the MAPs to the mobile nodes.

   When the three protocols are all used, the mobile node has several IP
   addresses to choose from for communication purposes.  For really



Narayanan, et al.        Expires August 29, 2007               [Page 23]

Internet-Draft  IP Mobility and Multi-homing Interations   February 2007


   long-lived connections, it is always better to use the most permanent
   IP address - this would be the Home Address of the mobile node.
   However, the mobile node may be running some latency sensitive
   applications that are not necessarily long-lived.  Voice over IP is
   one such application.  In those cases, tunneling all the data packets
   through the Home Agent may introduce unacceptable latency for the
   application.  When Route Optimization is used, it is feasible to
   avoid such tunneling - however, route optimization support may not be
   available and it may also be considered expensive in some cases.  For
   such cases, it would be an option to use the HMIP RCoA as the IP
   address for applications.  Especially in situations of overlapping
   HMIP coverage as discussed above, the transition from one HMIP RCoA
   to another may be made seamlessly via SIP Re-Invite messages for the
   purposes of applications such as VoIP.  Such a transition would be
   needed when the application persists while the mobile node is moving
   across MAP boundaries.  It is also feasible to continue keeping the
   association with the old MAP until the end of the application, if it
   was going to only be short-lived.

6.1.2.  MIP and MOBIKE

   One method of combining MIP and MOBIKE is described for MIP4 in [3].
   In that model, MIP is used for mobility inside a given secure
   network, while MOBIKE with a VPN gateway is used for mobility outside
   the secure network.  The general goal there is to allow enterprise
   mobile devices to keep the same IP address while roaming in and out
   of the enterprise network.  There are other possible combinations as
   well.

   There is the question of the usefulness of MOBIKE when MIP6 is
   employed.  MIP6 inherently provides a means of updating the IKE
   endpoint IP address when the mobile node registers a new Care-of-
   Address for itself.  This functionality is supported by indicating
   the need for dynamic key management in the MIP6 binding update sent
   by the mobile node with a new Care-of-Address.  This is functionality
   that would be duplicated by MOBIKE if both protocols were to be used
   in conjunction.  By using a MIP6 Home Agent as also a VPN gateway, it
   is then feasible to just use MIP6 for mobility and still provide
   protected access.  However, in addition to allowing changes to the
   local IP address of the initiator (typically the MIP6 mobile node),
   MOBIKE also allows the responder (typically the MIP6 Home Agent) to
   be multihomed and change the IP address used in a security
   association - this is not functionality supported by MIP6.  Hence,
   depending on the requirements, it may make sense to run MIP6 and
   MOBIKE together or not in a given system.

   Further, if the goal is to provide support for mobile devices roaming
   in and out of enterprise networks, it is likely that both protocols



Narayanan, et al.        Expires August 29, 2007               [Page 24]

Internet-Draft  IP Mobility and Multi-homing Interations   February 2007


   are needed, unless detection of protected vs. unprotected network can
   happen through other means.  This is due to the fact that in the
   MIP6-only mode, the Home Agent is made reachable from inside and
   outside the protected network.  Hence, if the policy to use IPsec for
   data traffic only applies when the client is outside the protected
   network, the client must be able to securely determine whether it is
   attached to the protected network or not.  If not, an impersonating
   element in the access network will successfully cause the mobile node
   to send sensitive data without any protection.  In the model
   described in [3], the Home Agent is not reachable from an external
   network and hence, that provides a rather secure means of ensuring
   that unprotected data exchange does not occur while the MN is
   attached to an untrusted network.

   Future revisions of this document will address this kind of
   combination in greater detail.

6.1.2.1.  Security Implications

   As in the case of multi-level node-based IP mobility management, this
   mechanism also requires the mobile node to possess appropriate
   security associations with the Home Agent and the VPN gateway
   performing MOBIKE.  The security association for MIP must be tied to
   the home address, while the IPsec selectors for the security
   association created or modified using MOBIKE will depend on the type
   of protection that is intended using that SA.

   Additionally, the security of the internal IP addressing semantics of
   a protected network may be important to consider while designing a
   solution that requires both VPNs and mobility support.  For example,
   the VPN gateway, in many networks, is the only reachable device from
   an unprotected network.  If a MIP6 Home Agent was made reachable from
   an external network, it may be exposed to additional threats than the
   case where the Home Agent is "behind" the VPN gateway and only
   accessible from the protected network.  Also, another consideration
   while deciding to choose between a MIP6-only with data protection and
   a combined MIP6-MOBIKE solution with separate VPN gateway and Home
   Agent, is ensuring the ability to securely detect the connectivity to
   an untrusted network to avoid sending unprotected sensitive data over
   the untrusted network.  An alternative would be to always require
   that data be sent in a protected manner, irrespective of the location
   of the mobile node.  However, that adds a lot of load on the Home
   Agent/VPN Gateway device to process a lot more protected traffic and
   is often unnecessary.

6.1.3.  MIP and SHIM6

   As described in Section 3, MIP and SHIM6 can either be deployed in a
   complementary or competing fashion.  The mobile node may be multi-
   addressed in the local networks by virtue of either the local network
   being multi-homed or attaching to multiple local networks.  In such
   cases, if MIP is employed to handle mobility, it is easier for the
   local multi-addressing to be handled as part of mobility.  In other
   words, the mobile node may register multiple Care-of-Addresses tied
   to the same Home Address with the HA.  The mobile node may then use
   any Care-of-Address to send or receive data.

   However, when the mobile node is multi-addressed with IP addresses
   from multiple home networks, even if MIP is used in each home
   network, it only ties each Home Address with one or more of the Care-
   of-Addresses that the mobile node possesses.  So, while multiple Home
   Addresses can each be bound to multiple (same or different) Care-of-
   Addresses, MIP does not facilitate tying the Home Addresses itself
   together.  This is due to the fact that MIP requires a central entity
   (Home Agent) for address mappings and each such entity can only
   handle IP addresses belonging to it.  SHIM6 is a potential solution
   to handle such multihoming.  Using SHIM6, both Home Addresses can be
   tied together by providing a common ULID to a correspondent node.
   Hence, the correspondent nodes may reach the mobile node via either
   Home Addresses, and this helps to ensure reachability even when one
   of the home networks is down.  Some of this concept is covered in
   [4].  Future revisions of this document will provide more details.

                         Figure 6: MIP and NETLMM

   This section describes how node-based global mobility and network-
   based local mobility can co-exist in an architecture.  Figure 6 shows
   an architecture that has a MIP Home Agent as part of the home network
   and network-based mobility entities, LMA and MAG in the local
   network.  Network-based mobility discussions in this section apply
   equally to solutions described in [5], [6], and [7].  The term NetLMM
   is used to refer to any of these solutions in a generic manner.

   Figure 6 shows the architectural entities involved in the two
   protocols.  While this is architecturally similar to the MIP/HMIP
   overlay described in Section 6.1.1, there are some significant
   differences arising due to the fact that the local mobility here



Narayanan, et al.        Expires August 29, 2007               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft  IP Mobility and Multi-homing Interations   February 2007


   happens without mobile node involvement.

   Conceptually, there are similarities between this model and the MIP/
   HMIP overlay model.  The MAP and LMA are equivalent in function and
   scope - the LMA keeps track of the mobility of the mobile node within
   the local network.  However, an important difference is that local
   mobility is achieved here by preserving the same local address for
   the mobile node within the local network, as described in
   Section 4.2.  The mobile node may register such a local address
   anchored at the LMA as its Care-of-Address with the Home Agent - MIP
   updates are then only necessary when the mobile node associates with
   a new LMA.

   As in the case of the MIP/HMIP overlay, it is feasible to have one of
   the local networks as the Mobile IP home network of the mobile node.
   In such a case, the LMA and Home Agent for a given mobile node would
   be collocated in that local network and the mobile node would be
   "home" from a MIP perspective while attached to that network.  MIP
   operation is then only needed when the mobile node is not attached to
   that network.  However, this model has some security implications
   that are worth noting and those are captured in Section 6.2.1.  In
   addition to the security implications, this model may also lead to
   some race conditions which are analyzed in Section 6.2.4.

   As the mobile node moves within a local network, its current location
   will be updated at the LMA by the appropriate MAG.  A separate
   protocol between the mobile node and the MAG may be employed to
   detect the attachment of an mobile node to a MAG.  Alternately, some
   technologies may allow mobile node movement detection at the network
   and trigger a context transfer between MAGs to provide the necessary
   information to complete the new location registration.

6.2.1.  Security Implications

   The node-based mobility here is handled by the mobile node and Home
   Agent and the network-based mobility is handled by the MAG and LMA.
   The mobile node needs to possess a security association with the Home
   Agent tied to its Home Address for MIP operation, as is normally the
   case.  For the NetLMM operation, there must be a Security Association
   between the MAG and the LMA.  This security association provides the
   needed data origin authentication.  However, it does not guarantee
   the attachment of the mobile node with that particular MAG.  Without
   mobile node involvement or some authorization checks involving an
   entity such as a AAA server, it is not feasible to provide any
   guarantees about the actual presence of the mobile node at that MAG.
   Hence, a malfunctioning or compromised MAG would be able to redirect
   traffic meant for that mobile node by creating an incorrect binding
   at the LMA.  However, such a threat can be limited in scope by



Narayanan, et al.        Expires August 29, 2007               [Page 28]

Internet-Draft  IP Mobility and Multi-homing Interations   February 2007


   ensuring that a MAG is only capable of updating bindings for
   addresses that are valid in that local domain.  This requires
   appropriate prefix partitioning and verification of the address
   claimed by the LMA for the mobile node against the prefix it is
   authorized to serve.  In such a case, the MAG would be unable to
   redirect traffic of an mobile node that is not within its local
   network.

   An additional security implication is when one of the local networks
   is considered to be the MIP home network, making the local address
   acquired by the mobile node in that network its MIP Home Address.  In
   this case, while the mobile node is within that domain, the security
   risks are analogous to what has been described so far.  However, it
   is feasible for a MAG to redirect traffic belonging to a mobile node
   even when the mobile node is no longer in that local network.  Even
   if the redirection is not successful in some cases, it is capable of
   leading to ambiguity in mobile node's current location at the LMA/
   Home Agent.  This is due to the fact that the MAG and the mobile node
   are both authorized to perform updates corresponding to the same IP
   address.  This would basically result in the security guarantees of
   MIP being affected by the use of NetLMM.  Such a threat may be
   mitigated by requiring the LMA to reject any updates to the mobile
   node's local address (which is the same as the Home Address in this
   case) by a MAG when there is an existing binding for that address
   created by the mobile node.  However, this leads to some undesirable
   inter-dependencies between the two protocols and also may lead to
   less than ideal mobility management, as described in Section 6.2.4.

6.2.2.  Multihoming Implications

   Unlike the HMIP case, multi-homing at the local networks level cannot
   be handled by the NetLMM class of solutions.  For instance, the
   mobile node may be multihomed by virtue of attachment to two MAGs
   within the same LMA or under different LMAs.  An IP node will obtain
   a distinct global IP address on each of its interfaces (physical or
   virtual) - hence, if the mobile node is attached to two MAGs at any
   given time, it will acquire separate IP addresses.

   NetLMM provides mobility to each IP address and by itself, has no
   means of tying the multiple IP addresses to the same mobile node.
   Hence, mobility for these IP addresses will be handled independently
   by default.  However, certain technologies may have the capability to
   identify (say, via L2 mapping) that a given set of IP addresses
   belong to the same mobile node.  In such a case, it is feasible for
   this to be known at the LMA.  However, even so, it is not feasible
   for these IP addresses to be associated with any per-packet
   identifier.  Unlike the ULID in SHIM6 or RCoA in HMIP, NetLMM does
   not have anything available for the mobile and correspondent nodes to

   use for communication.

   Extracting from the above, in terms of data flow, these addresses are
   practically independent and the ability to correlate multiple IP
   addresses belonging to the same mobile node at the LMA is of little
   use.  In other words, it is unlike the case where the correspondent
   nodes pick one IP address of the mobile node to get the data to the
   LMA, with multiple possible paths available to the mobile node from
   there.  In this case, the correspondent node and the mobile node need
   to pick a particular mobile node address to correspond with.  Note
   that when MIP is used, this correspondent node may actually be the
   Home Agent.  Hence, when the mobile node has multiple IP addresses,
   the decision of picking an address to correspond with is still left
   to the application and not handled by NetLMM.

   Extending this analysis to multihoming for mobile nodes with multi-
   radio capabilities, it is not even feasible for the network to
   provide any correlation between IP addresses of the mobile node,
   given that there is no common L2 identifier.  With involvement on the
   mobile node's part, it may be feasible to obtain an access agnostic
   identity to correlate with the multiple IP addresses.  However, that
   would be defeating one of the motivations of having network-based
   mobility transparent to the mobile node.

   It is conceivable that the same global IP address is assigned to the
   mobile node for multiple interfaces - however, that requires a
   fundamental change to the functioning of regular IP nodes.  Further,
   it also places restrictions on the simultaneous use of such multiple
   interfaces.  It also requires intelligence below the IP layer to pick
   the correct interface for different packets sent with the same IP
   address, which would typically not be needed.

   The above analysis leads to the following conclusions.

   o  Without an out-of-band mechanism, it is not feasible for the MAG
      or LMA to correlate multiple IP addresses as belonging to the same
      mobile node.

   o  Even with such correlation, there is no means of presenting a
      single IP address to applications with multiple paths over the
      network.  Hence, applications are exposed to multiple IP addresses
      by default.

   o  Providing the same global IP address to multiple interfaces would
      require undesirable changes to mobile nodes and places
      restrictions on simultaneous use of the interfaces.

   By this analysis, it appears that network-based mobility management

Internet-Draft  IP Mobility and Multi-homing Interations   February 2007


   is not well-suited to handle any kind of multi-homing of a mobile
   node.  The mobile node is in the best position to determine the
   availability and connection capabalities of its various interfaces
   and hence, multi-addressing and multi-homing is best handled using
   node-based mobility management.

6.2.3.  Network-based mobility for non-MIP nodes

   We have analyzed the co-existence of node and network-based mobility
   for a given mobile node for two-level mobility management thus far.
   The other model is where network-based mobility is only intended for
   nodes that are incapable of mobility management on their own, such as
   legacy mobile devices.  In that case, a given network must support
   network-based mobility for such devices and let other mobile nodes
   handle their own mobility.  In the NetLMM class of solutions, the
   entire local network is made to appear as having the same IP prefix -
   this is achieved by advertising the same prefix to the mobile node as
   it moves within the local network.  By virtue of such a protocol, it
   is not feasible to differentiate between MIP-capable and non-MIP-
   capable endpoints using functionality provided in the protocol
   itself.  Such detection is only feasible via some out-of-band
   mechanism.  In some systems, it may be feasible for the network to
   know the capabilities of the nodes that attach to it.  If the network
   is aware of the capabilities, it would be feasible to present an
   unchanging IP address or prefix throughout the local network only to
   devices that need network-based mobility.

6.2.4.  Other Analysis

   This section provides additional analysis on the scenario where
   network-based local mobility is used on the mobile node's home
   network to make the entire local network appear to the mobile node as
   its Mobile IP home network.  Section 6.2.1 describes the security
   implications of the model and shows that it is essential to ensure
   that a network-based mobility binding for the mobile node's Home
   Address is only accepted when there is no current binding for that
   address created by the mobile node itself.  That will ensure that the
   MIP security guarantees are still available to the mobile node.
   However, that may lead to a less than ideal mobility solution for the
   mobile node.  It is possible that a registration from the network
   node arrives at the entity serving as the LMA/Home Agent before the
   mobile node has a chance to de-register with the Home Agent.  In that
   case, such a registration will be rejected until the mobile node is
   successfully de-registered from a MIP perspective and its binding is
   removed at the Home Agent.  This may result in undesirable handoff
   latency for the mobile node, when the mobile node is moving in and
   out of its home network.

   This further introduces the need for some inter-dependency between
   the node and network-based mobility protocols.  Specifically, the
   NetLMM solution must be able to detect the presence of a MIP binding
   for a given IP address before accepting a certain registration for an
   mobile node.  When the NetLMM solution used is PMIP, this may be less
   painful - nevertheless, it is still undesirable behavior.

   Overall, systems evaluating such an approach must take such
   shortcomings into account before using it.  The use of this approach
   allows data exchange in this extended home network without additional
   tunnel overhead (as MIP6 would have) between the mobile node and the
   Access Router.  It is important to evaluate the need for this, along
   with the other solutions such as header compression (say, RoHC) that
   may be deployed in the system.  RoHC, for instance handles two IP
   headers as easily as it does one - hence, if RoHC is needed anyway,
   the tradeoffs of using this approach may not be worth it.
