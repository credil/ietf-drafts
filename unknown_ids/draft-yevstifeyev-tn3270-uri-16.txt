INTERNET DRAFT            'tn3270' URI scheme          February 11, 2011


1.  Introduction

   The 'tn3270' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme was firstly
   mentioned in RFC 1738 [RFC1738] as used for "Interactive 3270
   emulation sessions".  Following the creation of the URI scheme
   registries per RFC 4395 [RFC4395], this scheme was added to the
   "Provisional URI Schemes" sub-registry in the "Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) Schemes" IANA registry [URIREG].  However RFC 1738
   [RFC1738] does not give any definition of syntax and semantics of the
   'tn3270' URI scheme and does not have any guidelines for its
   registration.

   Since there are no any acceptable specification of 'tn3270' URI
   scheme, there is a risk that somebody might try to implement it with
   some new, possibly undocumented syntax, just by looking at IANA
   registry.  In order to minimize such risk, this documents gives
   precise definition of syntax, semantics and use of this URI scheme.

   The generic syntax of URIs is described in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]. 
   Registration procedures for new URI schemes are defined in RFC 4395
   [RFC4395].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

INTERNET DRAFT            'tn3270' URI scheme          February 11, 2011


2.  Scheme Definition 

   The 'tn3270' URI scheme is used to access services that are provided
   via Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270) (provided by 'Telnet 3270 regime'
   Telnet option [RFC1041]; see RFC 1576 [RFC1576] for TN3270 practices
   and IBM Publication GA23-0059 [GA23-0059] for details on 3270 data
   stream mode) and Telnet 3270 Enchanted Mode (TN3270E) (provided by
   'TN3270E' Telnet option [RFC2355]).  In fact TN3270 and TN3270E are
   Telnet [RFC854] service with special data transfer mode.

   Note: This document does not specify the TN3270 and TN3270E 
         services themselves, but only the URI scheme for them.

   The 'tn3270' URI takes the following form (given in ABNF, as
   described in RFC 5234 [RFC5234]):

   tn3270uri = "tn3270:" hier-part 
   hier-part = "//" host [":" port] ["/"]

   The 'host' and 'port' rules are specified in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  If
   'port' is omitted, it SHALL default to 21.  The final character "/"
   MAY be omitted.

3.  Security Considerations

   Generic security considerations for the usage of URIs are discussed
   in Section 7 of [RFC3986].

   Since 'tn3270' URIs provide access to services that are available via
   TN3270 and TN3270E, that do not add any new security issues to Telnet
   session, as they are designated via Telnet option, there are no other
   security considerations for 'tn3270' URI not discussed in RFC 4248
   [RFC4248] - the 'telnet' URI scheme specification.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to update the registration of tn3270 URI scheme using
   the following registration template (see [RFC4395]):

     URI scheme name: tn3270

     Status: Permanent

     URI scheme syntax: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx

     URI scheme semantics: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx

     URI scheme encoding considerations: generic encoding considerations
     for URI schemes, defined in Section 2 of [RFC3986], concern
     'tn3270' one as well.  Non-ASCII characters are to be mapped as
     defined in Section 3.1 of RFC 3987 [RFC3987]

     Protocols that use the scheme: Telnet 3270 mode (TN3270) (provided
     by 'Telnet 3270 regime' Telnet option [RFC1041]; see RFC 1576
     [RFC1576] for TN3270 practices and IBM Publication GA23-0059 [GA23-
     0059] for details on 3270 data stream mode) and Telnet 3270
     Enchanted Mode (TN3270E) (provided by 'TN3270E' Telnet option
     [RFC2355])

     Security considerations: see Section 3 of RFC xxxx
