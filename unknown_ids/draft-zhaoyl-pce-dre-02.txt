     Protocol Extension Requirement for Cooperation between PCE and
            Distributed Routing Controller in GMPLS Networks
                        draft-zhaoyl-pce-dre-02

Abstract

   Path Computation Element (PCE) is proposed for path computation in
   multi-layer and multi-domain networks where PCE can be implemented in
   centralized method or distributed method.  In the former case, PCE
   can serve tens or hundreds of nodes simultaneously, while in the
   later case, each node is equipped with a PCE, which can be regarded
   as a distributed routing controller (DRC) in GMPLS networks providing
   similar path computation capability.  PCE and DRC have different
   advantages in path computation respectively.  PCE is suitable for
   cross-layer and cross-domain path computation, especially in multi-
   constraints environment.  But distributed routing controller is good
   at path computation in parallel and distributed network control in
   local domain.  A cooperative path computation architecture named Dual
   Routing Engine (DRE) is necessary in the future networks, for it
   based on the two path computation engines and can take the advantages
   of both centralized and distributed method.  The corresponding PCE
   communication protocol extension and other protocol requirements for
   cooperation between PCE and distributed routing controller are listed
   in this document.

1.  Introduction

   Path Computation Element (PCE) is proposed to complete the
   constraint-based shortest path computation in Multi-protocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) multi-layer and multi-
   domain networks [RFC4665].  Then a series of Request for Comments
   (RFCs) related to PCE technology, such as requirements for PCE
   discovery, PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP), a backward recursive
   PCE-based computation procedure (BRPC) and so on, have been
   standardized.  Studies prove that PCE is suitable for cross-layer and
   cross-domain design of networks, capable of end-to-end path
   computation under multiple constraints [1-2] and could be potentially
   applied to resource assignment and routing optimization [3-4].  PCE
   can be implemented in centralized method or distributed method.  In
   the former case, PCE can serve tens or hundreds of nodes
   simultaneously. while in the later case, each node is equipped with a
   PCE, which can be regarded as a distributed routing controller (DRC)
   in GMPLS networks providing similar path computation capability.  DRC
   in GMPLS/ASON control plane is good at the path computation in
   parallel and distributed network control in local domain.  On the
   other hand, as the huge bandwidth requirement emerges, links with the
   transmission capacity of Tbit/s and switching at Pbit/s are necessary
   for next generation optical networks.  According to the current
   photonics technology level, the node architecture will be very
   complicated and of large power consumption.  Therefore, how to
   configure the switching architecture in the node will be very
   important for the entire network performance.  DRC can also be used
   in the management and configuration of resource in internal node.  Of
   course, each of PCE and DRC has corresponding different disadvantages
   respectively.

   In order to optimize the performance of optical networks under
   different application scenarios, PCE and distributed routing
   controller need to cooperate with each other.  A cooperative path
   computation architecture named Dual Routing Engine (DRE) is proposed,
   which includes two path computation engines, i.e.  PCE and
   distributed routing controller, and can combine advantages of both
   sides.  Several different application scenarios are described in this
   document.  PCE communication protocol extension and other protocol
   extension requirements for cooperation between PCE and distributed
   routing controller are listed here.

3.  General Assumptions

   PCE and distributed routing controller are two path computation
   engines which have been standardized by IETF working group.  They can
   both complete the path computation in GMPLS networks.  In order to
   show how the cooperative architecture based on PCE and distributed
   routing controller works, we make some assumptions as follows.

   o  Each GMPLS-based control node is equipped with a distributed
      routing controller which can complete the path computation in
      local domain, even the path computation and resource configuration
      in the internal node, and each domain is equipped with no less
      than one PCE which cannot only complete the intra-domain path
      computation, but also complete the inter-domain path computation.

   o  The topology and TE information are updated as soon as any change
      occurs in the network, and the information kept at PCE and
      distributed routing controller are synchronized by OSPF-TE.

   o  PCE and distributed routing controller can be selected arbitrary
      according to the local routing strategy.

   o  Constraints and strategies can be considered by PCE during the
      process of path computation including the intra-domain path
      computation and inter-domain path computation.

   o  An end-to-end path which crosses domains or crosses layers can be
      completed by several PCEs or several DRCs or several PCEs and
      DRCs.  For example, the section of an end-to-end path in one
      domain may be computed by PCE, but the section of this path in
      another domain may be computed by DRC.


4.  Cooperative Architecture based on PCE and Distributed Routing
    Controller

   As shown in Fig. 1, cooperative architecture consists of Path
   Computation Element (PCE) and distributed routing controller (DRC).
   Both of them maintain Traffic Engineering Databases (TEDs) to keep
   network topology and other status information within the scope of
   their respective functions.  There is a function module named Routing
   Engine Selector (RES) at each control node, which is responsible for
   managing the switchover process between PCE and DRC and choosing the
   right one when a LSP setup request arrives.  At the same time, RES
   posses the function of PCC and can be implemented in Connection
   Controller (CC) module of GMPLS-based control plane.

4.1.  DRC

   DRC offers general routing functions based on GMPLS/ASON control
   plane including link state advertisement, topology update and path
   computation.  A typical DRC contains two essential modules which are
   topology analysis module and path computation module.  The former
   floods network topology and resource utilization information to
   maintain TED in each node.  The latter responds to a routing request
   from Connection Controller (CC), finds the optimized path solution
   and returns it to CC.  Besides the general routing functions, DRC can
   also complete the resource allocation and configuration, which refers
   to internal resource allocation, ports interconnection, and switch
   fabric configuration in the internal node.  This function is getting
   more and more important as the structure of the internal node getting
   more and more complex.  Details of DRC operation are out of this
   document.

4.2.  PCE

   PCE is of particular advantage of centralized path computation in
   multi-layer and multi-domain networks, especially in multi-
   constraints environment.  There is a Client/Server model between RES
   and PCE.  RES sends a TE-LSP computation request to PCE.  PCE
   performs path computation and returns the results back to RES.

   Firstly RES chooses the best PCE based on a certain policy.  It sends
   performance query requests to multiple related PCEs, each of which
   evaluates itself individually and then feeds back to the RES.  RES
   gathers performance status information from PCEs and decides which
   one is feasible.  Thus a combination of RES and PCE is founded.
   Secondly PCE serves to deal with the path computation requests coming
   from RES through message parser.  If a request carries path
   information, it will be directed towards path computer.  If it
   carries policy information from RES, it is first interpreted by
   policy parser along with local policy settings and then loaded into
   path computer.  Finally path computer implements multi-constraint
   routing on the basis of the path information, policy information and
   TE information.  If path computation is successful the details of the
   whole route will be returned to RES.  If it only gets an incomplete
   route a new application for path computation request will be sent to
   the next hop RES.  Then a PCE or DRC will be selected to complement
   the incomplete route.

5.  Different Application Scenarios

   Cooperation between PCE and DRC is one of the key issues in the
   cooperative architecture, for it helps to achieve fast and exact
   routing due to the advantages of both PCE and DRC.  This section will
   list several typical application scenarios of cooperation between PCE
   and DRC.

5.1.  Cross layers and cross domains

   It is necessary for PCE to collaborate with DRC when the requirements
   for path computation occur in multi-layer and multi-domain GMPLS
   networks.  PCE could be shared among several domains or layers and
   make the best use of the inter-domain and inter-layer network
   resources, so it is more suitable for inter-domain or inter-layer
   path computation.  In contrast to PCE, DRC usually runs to fulfill
   intra-domain or intra-layer routing.

5.2.  Independent coexistence

   Both PCE and DRC are working independently under this scenario.
   While one customer applies a TE-LSP computation RES could select PCE
   or DRC arbitrarily.  Of course each time only one path computation
   engine can be selected.  If a lot of applications for path
   computation arrive simultaneously, the burst computing load may be
   also balanced between them.  The changed topology and resource status
   information should be maintained in PCE and DRC.  So it is difficult
   to manage the information synchronization on both sides.

5.3.  Security backup

   The cooperation mechanisms among different engines make it possible
   that PCE and DRC backup each other to enhance the routing security
   and reliability, since they both satisfy the demands of path
   computation from customers.  When the working engine (e.g.  PCE)
   fails, computation tasks could be switched to another reserved engine
   (e.g.  DRC) as soon as possible.  In such a case both PCE and DRC
   should maintain the accordant network topology and resource status
   information.

5.4.  Policy-enabled

   In order to compute the optimal path in consideration of traffic
   engineering, different policies are involved, which mean there are
   series of rules and actions from management plane or control plane.
   PCE is obviously more suitable for policy-enabled path computation
   framework than DRC.  Tab.1 lists some typical policy application
   instances that may be exerted to the cooperative path computation

   architecture.  Effective combinations of the above scenarios as well
   as possible new scenarios could occur in the real networks.

                                  Table 1

5.5.  Constraint-based

   Constraint-based path computation is a basic function especially for
   TE-LSP establishment.  Available bandwidth, diversity, Shared Risk
   Link Group (SRLG), optical impairments, wavelength continuity and
   other constraints are likely to be considered.  However, it is
   difficult to compute an optimal path with these constraints under the
   condition of the general GMPLS/ASON routing architecture.  The
   centralized operation manner makes PCE easy to fulfill constraint-
   based path computation.

5.6.  Service-oriented

   PCEs can collaborate to finish constraint-based path computation
   without sharing TE information with each other, which are
   particularly useful when end-to-end constraints have to be taken into
   account because of protection and path diversity.  PCEs should play
   an important role of service-oriented applications such as Layer 1
   Virtual Private Network (L1 VPN), Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) and so
   on.  Based on GMPLS/ASON architecture, the advantages of PCE and
   service plane can be combined to implement the framework of service-
   oriented application.

5.7.  Cooperation between network level and node level

   In this application scenario, PCE maintains Traffic Engineering
   Databases (TEDs) to keep network topology, and DRC maintains Resource

Internet-Draft       Cooperation between PCE and DRC          April 2011


   Information Databases (RIDs) to keep node internal topology and
   resource status.  Both of them maintain the status information within
   the scope of their functions.  Routing Engine Selector (RES) is
   responsible for managing the switchover process between PCE and DRC
   and choosing the right one when a LSP setup request arrives.

   The interconnection between different nodes is the routing problem
   generally, which can be solved by PCE framework effectively,
   especially in multi-domain, multi-layer and multi-constraints
   scenarios, while the interconnection within the node is the problem
   of resource allocation and configuration, which refers to internal
   resource allocation, ports interconnection, and switch fabric
   configuration.  Through the cooperation of PCE and DRC, we can make
   resource configuration more effectively and improve the performance
   of the entire optical networks.


6.  PCEP Extension Requirements

   As an extension of PCC, RES can not only complete the communication
   between PCE and DRC, but also complete the cooperation between PCE
   and DRC.  There are some PCEP extension requirements for the
   cooperative path computation architecture and the procedure.

6.1.  PCEP extension requirement for the communication between RES and
      PCE

   PCEP is the communication protocol between RES and PCE.  However,
   there is some extension requirement for PCEP in the cooperative path
   computation architecture.

   Firstly, an identification which appoints different application
   scenarios should be added to the path computation request messages
   from RES to PCE, and the corresponding data structure should be
   defined according to different identifications.  For example, in the
   policy-enabled scenario, a policy object is necessary to be defined
   in the message sent from RES to PCE, and PCE should be able to parse
   the different policies and conduct the corresponding operations
   during the procedure of path computation.

   Secondly, in the reply message from PCE to RES, some indication
   information should be contained besides the routes information, such
   as the inter-domain loose path or the intra-domain path, the complete
   end-to-end path or section path, some failure information and path
   computation engine switchover requests.

6.2.  PCEP extension requirement for the communication between RES and
      DRC

   DRC can complete the path computation in local domain in the
   distributed method, which is usually implemented in the OSPF-TE
   module of GMPLS-based control plane.  After the path computation, DRC
   returns the computation results to RES (CC) including the detailed
   routes and some failure or indication information.

   As another important application, DRC can complete the path
   computation, resource management and configuration in the internal
   node even as the node structure is getting more and more complex.  In
   this application scenario, DRC has the function of routing and
   resource allocation.

   In all the application scenarios, DRC has the analogous functions
   with PCE and some different extension functions, such as the
   functions above.  So there is requirement for application scenarios
   identification in the communication message between RES and DRC.  The
   communication protocol between RES and DRC is necessary to be
   standardized as the function of control node getting more and more
   complex.  Because RES and DRC are implemented in the same control
   node and DRC has similar functions with PCE, then a simplified PCEP
   can be used as the communication protocol between RES and DRC, which
   can include the path computation request, identification and reply
   messages only.


7.  Other Protocol Extension Requirements

7.1.  OSPF-TE extension requirement for the cooperative architecture

   In the cooperative path computation architecture, the topology and TE
   information should be kept and synchronized at each control node and
   PCE in local domain, and should also be updated as soon as any change
   occurs.  Meanwhile, all the inter-domain links and TE information
   should be kept and synchronized at each PCE.  So there is extension
   requirement for OSPF-TE to guarantee the information at each node
   synchronized in time.

   Besides the normal topology and TE information, some other
   constraints information may be necessary to be contained in the
   OSPF-TE protocol flooding in the entire networks, such as the
   physical impairment information.  Then there is an extension
   requirement for the OSPF-TE protocol to enable the synchronization of
   all the constraint information at each node, which is of great value
   for the path computation and resource allocation.

7.2.  RSVP-TE extension requirement for the cooperative architecture

   In different cooperation modes between PCE and DRC, an end-to-end
   path may be computed by several PCE and DRC, and then be setup by
   signaling from the source node to the destination node.  However,
   sometimes an end-to-end path which crosses domains or layers may be
   computed and setup section by section.  Signaling should be triggered
   when a section path is gained.  The current RSVP-TE protocol is
   necessary to be extended to support this application scenario.

   Furthermore, as the scheme of path and resource allocation in the
   internal node is gained, the resource reservation and action of
   switches are to be conducted by some protocol as the control node is
   getting more and more complex.  RSVP-TE is the optimal option for
   this function, and to be extended.


8.  Discussions

   According to the development of GMPLS networks, the cooperative
   architecture can be introduced in two steps.  First, PCE and DRC can
   cooperate with each other to complete the path computation of the
   entire networks at network level.  Second, PCE and DRC can cooperate
   with each other to complete the path computation at network level and
   resource computation and allocation at node level with the network
   size increasing and node structure getting complex.


9.  Security Considerations

   The cooperation between PCE and DRC can enhance the security of
   networks because they can backup each other.  However, because the
   information is kept at both PCE and each DRC, especially the exchange
   of information across domain boundaries is necessary in the multi-
   domain operation, there is some security and confidentiality risk,
   which can inherits the security requirement defined [RFC5440] and
   [RFC5376].
