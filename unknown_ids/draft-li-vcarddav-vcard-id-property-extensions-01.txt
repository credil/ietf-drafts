Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                January 2011


1.  Introduction

   This specification adds three new properties to vCard 4.0, to specify
   the date of death, the place of birth, and the place of death of the
   object the vCard represents.

1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Syntax specifications shown here use the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234], and are specified as in the base
   vcard specification [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].


2.  Identification Property Extensions

2.1.  Property: DEATHDAY

   Namespace:

   Property name:  DEATHDAY

   Purpose:  To specify the date of death of the object the vCard
       represents.

   Value type:  The default is a single date-and-or-time value.  It can
       also be reset to a single text value.

   Cardinality:  *1

   Property parameters:  VALUE, CALSCALE, LANGUAGE
       CALSCALE can only be present when the value is a
       date-and-or-time value and actually contains a date or date-time.
       LANGUAGE can only b present when the value is text.

   Description:

   Format definition:
       DEATHDAY-param =  DEATHDAY-param-date / DEATHDAY-param-text
       DEATHDAY-value =  date-and-or-time / text
           ; Value and parameter MUST match.

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                January 2011


       DEATHDAY-param-date =  "VALUE=date-and-or-time"
       DEATHDAY-param-text =  "VALUE=text" / language-param

       DEATHDAY-param =/  altid-param / calscale-param / any-param
           ; calscale-param can only be present when DEATHDAY-value is
           ; date-and-or-time and actually contains a date or date-time.

   Examples:
       DEATHDAY:19960415
       DEATHDAY:--0415
       DEATHDAY;19531015T231000Z
       DEATHDAY;VALUE=text:circa 1800

2.2.  Property: BIRTHPLACE

   Namespace:

   Property name:  BIRTHPLACE

   Purpose:  To specify the place of birth of the object the vCard
       represents.

   Value type:  A single text value (default) or a single URI value.

   Cardinality:  *1

   Property parameters:  VALUE, LANGUAGE

   Description:

   Format definition:
       BIRTHPLACE-param =  "VALUE=" / ("text" / "uri")
       BIRTHPLACE-value =  text / uri
           ; Value and parameter MUST match.

       BIRTHPLACE-param =/  altid-param / language-param / any-param

   Examples:
       BIRTHPLACE:Babies'R'Us Hospital
       BIRTHPLACE;VALUE=uri:http://example.com/hospitals/babiesrus.vcf
       BIRTHPLACE;VALUE=uri:geo:46.769307,-71.283079

2.3.  Property: DEATHPLACE

3.  Security Considerations

   This presents no security considerations beyond those in section 9 of
   the base vcard specification [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev].


4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add the following entries to the vCard
   Properties registry, defined in [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-vcardrev] section
   10.3.1.

         +-----------+--------------+---------+------------------------+
         | Namespace | Property     | Status  | Reference              |
         +-----------+--------------+---------+------------------------+
         |           | DEATHDAY     | Current | RFCXXXX, section 2.1   |
         |           | BIRTHPLACE   | Current | RFCXXXX, section 2.2   |
         |           | DEATHPLACE   | Current | RFCXXXX, section 2.3   |
