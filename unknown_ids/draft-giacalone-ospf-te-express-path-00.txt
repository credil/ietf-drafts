   Abstract

   In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
   information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network
   performance criteria (e.g. latency) have become (or are becoming) as
   (or more) critical to data path selection than other metrics.

   This document describes extensions to OSPF TE (RFC3630) such that
   network performance information can be distributed and collected in a
   scalable fashion. The information collected from OSPF TE Express Path
   can then be used to make path selection decisions. Additionally, the
   information passed in these extensions will permit granular network
   performance monitoring.

   Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network
   performance information is distributed. The mechanisms for measuring
   network performance or acting on that information, once distributed,
   are outside the scope of this document.

1. Introduction

   In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial
   information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network
   performance information (e.g. latency) have (or are becoming) as (or
   more) critical to data path selection than other metrics. In many of
   these networks, bandwidth is relatively rich and homogeneous (e.g. a
   core network of all 10 or 20 Gigabit Ethernet links, or greater),
   however path length (and therefore latency) can vary in between end-
   points (e.g. PE nodes), and segment length or latency can change
   based on the path protection scheme used. In these networks,
   extremely large amounts of money rest on the ability to predictably
   make trades faster than the competition and the ability to access
   real time market data.

   In certain financial services networks, hop count, cost, and
   bandwidth are only tangentially important. Rather, it would be

   beneficial to be able to granularly monitor network performance
   and/or make path selection decisions based on performance data (such
   as latency) in a cost-effective and scalable way. In addition, since
   these networks may be built as overlays on top of multiple service
   provider networks, strict link-by-link service level agreement
   monitoring and enforcement mechanisms are needed.

   This document describes extensions to OSPF TE (hereafter called "OSPF
   TE Express Path"), that can be used to distribute various pieces of
   network performance information (such as link latency). The
   mechanisms described in this document only disseminate performance
   information. The methods for initially gathering that performance
   information, or acting on it once it is distributed are outside the
   scope of this document. OSPF Express Path provides a number of
   benefits:

   The data distributed by OSPF TE Express Path can be used to make path
   selection decisions. Using the link-by-link performance information
   data distributed by OSPF TE Express Path, end-to-end path selection
   can be performed based on performance metrics, as part of the normal
   operation of various routing protocols (e.g. by replacing cost with
   latency) or by using "second order" control plane protocols such as
   CSPF,  RSVP-TE [RFC3209], etc.

   OSPF TE Express Path enables a scalable, open mechanism for link-by-
   link SLA compliance monitoring, which is an important issue in large,
   diverse networks that use transport services from various providers.
   In networks like this, end-to-end latency is not always useful for
   enforcement of "underlying" SLAs (since various links from different
   providers may make up a path). This link-by-link performance
   monitoring data could easily be gathered by looking at a routing
   protocol's state database (on any router in an area, depending on
   what is being monitoring and disseminated by the routing protocol),
   using SNMP [RFC1441] on a per device basis, or in other ways.

3. Express Path Extensions to OSPF TE

   The extensions in this document build on the ones provided in OSPF TE
   (RFC3630) and GMPLS (RFC4203) to permit path selection and network
   monitoring based on various network performance items. As such, this
   document proposes new OSPF TE sub-TLVs that can be announced in OSPF
   TE LSAs. OSPF TE LSAs (RFC3630) are opaque LSAs (RFC5250) with area
   flooding scope. Each TLV has one or more nested sub-TLVs which
   permit the TE LSA to be readily extended. There are two main types
   of OSPF TE LSA; the Router Address or Link TE LSA. Like the GMPLS
   extensions (RFC4203), this document proposes additional sub-TLVs for
   the Link TE LSA. As background, all OSPF TE TLVs and sub-TLVs use
   the same general format (RFC3630):



     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |              Type             |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                            Value...                           |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   As per (RFC3630) the Length field defines the length of the value
   portion of the sub-TLV in octets (thus a TLV with no value portion
   would have a length of zero). TLVs are padded to four-octet
   alignment; padding is not included in the length field (so a three
   octet value would have a length of three, but the total size of the
   TLV would be eight octets). Unrecognized types are ignored.

   OSPF TE Express Path defines several new sub-TLVs. These sub-TLVs
   fall into 2 distinct categories; "Routine" or "Significant". Routine
   and Significant sub-TLVs are intended to be used for different
   purposes (i.e. monitoring or control plane manipulation,
   respectively). The technical differences between Routine and
   Significant sub-TLVs are related to the averaging periodicity and
   announcement frequency of each category of sub-TLV. More information
   on this subject can be found in section 5.

   The following sub-TLVs are defined in OSPF TE Express Path:

         Value       Length   Name

5. Announcement Periodicity

   Routine announcements are intended to announce data for trending
   applications (e.g. advertising small variations in performance
   occurring over a longer period of time). Significant sub-TLVs are
   intended to announce the occurrence of more dramatic events that
   affect network performance (e.g. protection switching). A primary
   function of Significant sub-TLVs are to manipulate the control plane.

   Since Routine and Significant sub-TLVs have generally different
   goals, implementations SHOULD permit them to be announced using
   different thresholds and filtering (i.e. rolling average) parameters.



6. Announcement Suppression

   Implementations MAY suppress Routine announcements when performance
   metrics averages do not change by more than a certain amount. These
   suppression thresholds SHOULD be configurable.

   Significant announcements MUST only be sent when configurable
   thresholds are surpassed.



7. Compatibility

   As per (RFC3630), unrecognized TLVs should be silently ignored



8. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce security issues beyond those
   discussed in [RFC3630] and [RFC5329].



9. IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the registry for the sub-TLVs. OSPF TE Express Path
   will require one new type code per sub-TLV defined in this document.
