Abstract
   The IETF policies about rights in Contributions to the IETF are
   designed to ensure that such Contributions can be made available to
   the IETF and Internet communities while permitting the authors to
   retain as many rights as possible. This memo details the IETF
   policies on rights in Contributions to the IETF. It also describes
   the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.  This memo
   obsoletes RFC 3978 and 4748 and, with RFC 3979 and RFC xxx (rfc
   editor - replace with the RFC # of -outgoing), replaces Section 10 of
   RFC 2026.

1. Definitions
   The following definitions are for terms used in the context of this
   document. Other terms, including "IESG," "ISOC," "IAB," and "RFC
   Editor," are defined in [RFC2028].

   a. "Contribution": any submission to the IETF intended by the
      Contributor for publication as all or part of an Internet-Draft or
      RFC (except for RFC Editor Contributions described in Section 4
      below) and any statement made within the context of an IETF
      activity. Such statements include oral statements in IETF
      sessions, as well as written and electronic communications made at
      any time or place, which are addressed to:
      o the IETF plenary session,
      o any IETF working group or portion thereof,
      o any Birds of a Feather (BOF) session,
      o the IESG, or any member thereof on behalf of the IESG,



Bradner & Contreras                                             [Page 2]

Internet-Draft              RFC 3978-incoming              24 March 2008


      o the IAB or any member thereof on behalf of the IAB,
      o any IETF mailing list, including the IETF list itself, any
         working group or design team list, or any other list
         functioning under IETF auspices,
      o the RFC Editor or the Internet-Drafts function (except for RFC
         Editor Contributions described in Section 4 below).

      Statements made outside of an IETF session, mailing list or other
      function, that are clearly not intended to be input to an IETF
      activity, group or function, are not IETF Contributions in the
      context of this document.
   b. "Contributor": an individual submitting a Contribution.
   c. "Indirect Contributor": any person who has materially or
      substantially contributed to a Contribution without being
      personally involved in its submission to the IETF.
   d. "Copyright" means the legal right granted to an author in a
      document or other work of authorship under applicable law.  A
      "copyright" is not equivalent to a "right to copy".  Rather a
      copyright encompasses all of the exclusive rights that an author
      has in a work, such as the rights to copy, publish, distribute and
      create derivative works of the work.  An author often cedes these
      rights to his or her employer or other parties as a condition of
      employment or compensation.
   e. "IETF": In the context of this document, the IETF includes all
      individuals who participate in meetings, working groups, mailing
      lists, functions and other activities which are organized or
      initiated by ISOC, the IESG or the IAB under the general
      designation of the Internet Engineering Task Force or IETF, but
      solely to the extent of such participation.
   f. "IETF Documents": RFCs and Internet-Drafts that are used in the
      IETF Standards Process as defined in 1(g).
   g. "IETF Standards Process": the activities undertaken by the IETF in
      any of the settings described in 1(a) above.
   h. "IETF Trust": A trust established under the laws of the
      Commonwealth of Virginia, USA, in order to hold and administer
      intellectual property rights for the benefit of the IETF.
   i. "Internet-Draft": temporary documents used in the IETF Standards
      Process. Internet-Drafts are posted on the IETF web site by the
      IETF Secretariat.  As noted in Section 2.2 of RFC 2026, Internet-
      Drafts have a nominal maximum lifetime of six months in the IETF
      Secretariat's public directory.
   j.  "Legend Instructions" means the standardized text that is
      maintained by the IETF Trust and is included in IETF Documents and
      the instructions and requirements for including that standardized
      text in IETF Documents, each as posted from time to time at
      http://www.ietf.org/legends.
   k. "RFC": the basic publication series for the IETF. RFCs are
      published by the RFC Editor.  Although RFCs may be superseded in



Bradner & Contreras                                             [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              RFC 3978-incoming              24 March 2008


      whole or in part by subsequent RFCs, the text of an RFC is not
      altered once published in RFC form. (See [RFC2026] Section 2.1)
   l. "Reasonably and personally known": means something an individual
      knows personally or, because of the job the individual holds,
      would reasonably be expected to know. This wording is used to
      indicate that an organization cannot purposely keep an individual
      in the dark about certain information just to avoid the disclosure
      requirement.
   m. "RFC Editor Documents": means Internet-Drafts that are submitted
      to the RFC Editor independently of the IETF Standards Process.
      (See Section 4.)

2. Introduction
   In all matters of copyright and document procedures, the intent is to
   benefit the Internet community and the public at large, while
   respecting the legitimate rights of others.

   Under the laws of most countries and current international treaties
   (for example the "Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and
   Artistic Work" [Berne Convention]), authors obtain numerous rights in
   the works they produce automatically upon producing them. These
   rights include copyrights, moral rights and other rights. In many
   cases, if the author produces a work within the scope of his or her
   employment, most of those rights are usually assigned to the
   employer, either by operation of law or, in many cases, under
   contract. (The Berne Convention names some rights as "inalienable",
   which means that the author retains them in all cases.)

   In order for Contributions to be used within the IETF Standards
   Process, including when they are published as Internet-Drafts or
   RFCs, certain limited rights must be granted to the IETF Trust, which
   then grants the necessary rights to the IETF. In addition,
   Contributors must make representations to the IETF Trust and the IETF
   regarding their ability to grant these rights.

   Section 1 provides definitions used in these policies.  Sections 3
   and 4 of this document explain the rationale for these provisions.
   Sections 1, 2, 5 and 6 of this document are normative, the other
   sections are informative.  A companion document RFC 3979 [RFC3979]
   deals with rights, including possible patent rights, in technologies
   developed or specified as part of the IETF Standards Process. This
   document is not intended to address those issues.  This memo
   obsoletes RFC 3978 [RFC3978] and 4748 [RFC4748] and, with RFC 3979
   [RFC3979] and [-outgoing], replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026 [RFC2026].

   This document is not intended as legal advice. Readers are advised to
   consult their own legal advisors if they would like a legal
   interpretation of their rights or the rights of the IETF Trust



Bradner & Contreras                                             [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              RFC 3978-incoming              24 March 2008


   [RFC4371] in any Contributions they make.

2.1 No Retroactive Effect
   This memo does not retroactively obtain additional rights from
   Contributions that predate the date that the IETF Trust announces the
   adoption of these procedures.

3. Exposition of Why These Procedures Are the Way They Are

3.1. Rights Granted in Contributions
   The IETF Trust and IETF must obtain the right to publish an IETF
   Contribution as an RFC or an Internet-Draft from the Contributors.

   A primary objective of this policy is to obtain from the document
   authors only the non-exclusive rights that are needed to develop and
   publish IETF Documents and to use IETF Contributions in the IETF
   Standards Process and potentially elsewhere.

   The authors retain all other rights, but cannot withdraw the above
   rights from the IETF Trust and IETF.

   It is important to note that under this document Contributors are
   required to grant certain rights to the IETF Trust, (See Section
   5.3.) which holds all IETF-related intellectual property on behalf of
   the IETF community.  The IETF Trust will, in turn, grant a sublicense
   of these rights to all IETF participants for use in the IETF
   Standards Process.  (See Section 5.4.) This sublicense is necessary
   for the standards development work of the IETF to continue.  In
   addition, the IETF Trust may grant certain other sublicenses of the
   rights that it is granted under this document.  In granting such
   other sublicenses, the IETF Trust will be guided and bound by
   documents such as [-outgoing].

3.2. Rights to use Contributions
   It is important that the IETF receive assurances from all
   Contributors that they have the authority to grant the IETF the
   rights that they claim to grant because, under the laws of most
   countries and applicable international treaties, copyright rights
   come into existence when a work of authorship is created (but see
   Section 3.5 below regarding public domain documents), and the IETF
   cannot make use of IETF Contributions if it does not have sufficient
   rights with respect to these copyright rights.  IETF and its
   participants would run a greater risk of liability to the owners of
   these rights without this assurance.  To this end, IETF asks
   Contributors to give the assurances in Section 5.6 below. These
   assurances are requested, however, only to the extent of the
   Contributor's reasonable and personal knowledge. (See Section 1(k))

Internet-Draft              RFC 3978-incoming              24 March 2008


3.3. Right to Produce Derivative Works
   The IETF needs to be able to evolve IETF Documents in response to
   experience gained in the deployment of the technologies described in
   such IETF Documents, to incorporate developments in research and to
   react to changing conditions on the Internet and other IP networks.
   The IETF may also decide to permit others to develop derivative works
   based on Contributions.  In order to do this, the IETF must be able
   to produce derivatives of its documents; thus the IETF must obtain
   the right from Contributors to produce derivative works.  Note that
   the right to produce translations is required before any Contribution
   can be published as an RFC to ensure the widest possible distribution
   of the material in RFCs.  The right to produce derivative works, in
   addition to translations,  is required for all IETF standards track
   documents and for most IETF non-standards track documents. There are
   two exceptions to this requirement: documents describing proprietary
   technologies and documents that are republications of the work of
   other standards organizations.

   The right to produce derivative works must be granted in order for an
   IETF working group to accept a Contribution as a working group
   document or otherwise work on it. For non-working group Contributions
   where the Contributor requests publication as a standards track RFC,
   the right to produce derivative works must be granted before the IESG
   will issue an IETF Last-Call and, for most non-standards track non-
   working group Contributions, before the IESG will consider the
   Internet-Draft for publication.  Occasionally a Contributor may not
   want to grant publication rights or the right to produce derivative
   works before finding out if a Contribution has been accepted for
   development in the IETF Standards Process. In these cases the
   Contributor may include a limitation on the right to make derivative
   works in the form specified in the Legend Instructions. A working
   group can discuss the Contribution with the aim to decide if it
   should become a working group document, even though the right to
   produce derivative works or to publish the Contribution as an RFC has
   not yet been granted.  However, if the Contribution is accepted for
   development, the Contributor must resubmit the Contribution without
   the limitation notices before a working group can formally adopt the
   Contribution as a working group document.  The IETF Trust may
   establish different policies for granting sublicenses with respect to
   different types of Contributions and content within Contributions
   (such as executable code versus descriptive text or references to
   third party materials).  The IETF Trust's policies concerning the
   granting of sublicenses to make derivative works will be guided by
   RFC [-outbound].

   The IETF has historically encouraged organizations to publish details
   of their technologies, even when the technologies are proprietary,
   because understanding how existing technology is being used helps



Bradner & Contreras                                             [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              RFC 3978-incoming              24 March 2008


   when developing new technology. But organizations that publish
   information about proprietary technologies are frequently not willing
   to have the IETF produce revisions of the technologies and then
   possibly claim that the IETF version is the "new version" of the
   organization's technology. Organizations that feel this way can
   specify that a Contribution be published with the other rights
   granted under this document but may withhold the right to produce
   derivative works other than translations.

   In addition, IETF Documents frequently make normative references to
   standards or recommendations developed by other standards
   organizations. Since the publications of some standards organizations
   are not public documents, it can be quite helpful to the IETF to
   republish, with the permission of the other standards organization,
   some of these documents as RFCs so that the IETF community can have
   open access to them to better understand what they are referring to.
   In these cases the RFCs can be published without the right for the
   IETF to produce derivative works.  In both of the above cases in
   which the production of derivative works is excluded, the Contributor
   must include a special legend in the Contribution, as specified in
   the Legend Instructions, in order to notify IETF participants about
   this restriction.

3.4. Rights to Use Trademarks
   Contributors may wish to seek trademark or service mark protection on
   any terms that are coined or used in their Contributions. IETF makes
   no judgment about the validity of any such trademark rights.
   However, the IETF requires each Contributor, under the licenses
   described in Section 5.3 below, to grant IETF Trust a perpetual
   license to use any such trademarks or service marks solely in
   exercising rights to reproduce, publish, discuss and modify the IETF
   Contribution. This license does not authorize IETF or others to use
   any trademark or service mark in connection with any product or
   service offering.

3.5. Contributions Not Subject to Copyright
   Certain documents, including those produced by the U.S. government
   and those which are in the public domain, may not be protected by the
   same copyright and other legal rights as other documents.
   Nevertheless, we ask each Contributor to grant to the IETF the same
   rights as he or she would grant, and to make the same
   representations, as though the IETF Contribution were protected by
   the same legal rights as other documents, and as though the
   Contributor could be able to grant these rights. We ask for these
   grants and representations only to the extent that the Contribution
   may be protected. We believe they are necessary to protect the ISOC,
   the IETF Trust, the IETF, the IETF Standards Process and all IETF
   participants, and also because the IETF does not have the resources



Bradner & Contreras                                             [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              RFC 3978-incoming              24 March 2008


   or wherewithal to make any independent investigation as to the actual
   proprietary status of any document submitted to it.

3.6.  Copyright in RFCs.
   As noted above, Contributors to the IETF (or their employers) retain
   ownership of the copyright in their Contributions.  This includes
   Internet-Drafts and all other Contributions made within the IETF
   Standards Process (e.g., via e-mail, oral comment and otherwise).
   However, it is important that the IETF (through the IETF Trust) own
   the copyright in documents that are published as RFCs (other than
   Informational RFCs and RFCs that are submitted as RFC Editor
   Contributions).  Ownership of the copyright in an RFC does not
   diminish the Contributors' rights in their underlying contributions,
   but it does prevent anyone other than the IETF Trust (and its
   licensees) from republishing or modifying an RFC in RFC format.  In
   this respect, Contributors are treated the same as anybody else:
   though they may extract and republish their own Contributions without
   limitation, they may not do so in the RFC format used by the IETF.
   And while this principle (which is included in Section 5.9 below) may
   appear to be new to IETF, it actually reflects historical practice
   and has been observed for many years through the inclusion of an ISOC
   or IETF Trust copyright notice on all RFC documents since the
   publication of RFC 2026.

4.  RFC Editor Documents
   This document only relates to Contributions made as part of the IETF
   Standards Process.  Other documents that are referred to as Internet-
   Drafts and RFCs may be submitted to and published by the RFC Editor
   independently of the IETF Standards Process.  Such "RFC Editor
   Documents" are not covered by this document.  RFC Editor
   Contributions must be marked appropriately as described in the Legend
   Instructions.  See the RFC Editor web page for information about the
   policies concerning rights in RFC Editor Documents.

5. Rights in Contributions

5.1. General Policy
   By submission of a Contribution, each person actually submitting the
   Contribution, and each named co-Contributor, is deemed to have read
   and understood the rules and requirements set forth in this document.
   Each Contributor is deemed, by the act of submitting a Contribution,
   to enter into a legally-binding agreement to comply with the terms
   and conditions set forth in this document.

   The Contributor is further deemed to have agreed that he/she has
   obtained the necessary permissions to enter into such an agreement
   from any party that the Contributor reasonably and personally knows
   may have rights in the Contribution, including, but not limited to,



Bradner & Contreras                                             [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              RFC 3978-incoming              24 March 2008


   the Contributor's sponsor or employer.

   No further acknowledgement, signature or other action is required to
   bind a Contributor to these terms and conditions.  The operation of
   the IETF and the work conducted by its many participants is dependent
   on such agreement by each Contributor, and each IETF participant
   expressly relies on the agreement of each Contributor to the terms
   and conditions set forth in this document.

5.2. Confidentiality Obligations
   No information or document that is subject to any requirement of
   confidentiality or any restriction on its dissemination may be
   submitted as a Contribution or otherwise considered in any part of
   the IETF Standards Process, and there must be no assumption of any
   confidentiality obligation with respect to any Contribution. Each
   Contributor agrees that any statement in a Contribution, whether
   generated automatically or otherwise, that states or implies that the
   Contribution is confidential or subject to any privilege, can be
   disregarded for all purposes, and will be of no force or effect.

5.3. Rights Granted by Contributors to the IETF Trust
   To the extent that a Contribution or any portion thereof is protected
   by copyright or other rights of authorship, the Contributor, and each
   named co-Contributor grant a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive,
   royalty-free, world-wide, sublicensable right and license to the IETF
   Trust under all such copyrights and other rights in the Contribution:

   (A) to copy, publish, display, and distribute the Contribution, in
      whole or in part,
   (B) to prepare translations of the Contribution into languages other
      than English, in whole or in part, and to copy, publish, display,
      and distribute such translations or portions thereof,
   (C) to modify or prepare derivative works (in addition to
      translations) that are based on or incorporate all or part of the
      Contribution, and to copy, publish, display, and distribute such
      derivative works, or portions thereof unless explicitly disallowed
      in the notices contained in a Contribution [in the form specified
      by the Legend Instructions], and
   (D) to reproduce any trademarks, service marks or trade names which
      are included in the Contribution solely in connection with the
      reproduction, distribution or publication of the Contribution and
      derivative works thereof as permitted by this Section 5.3,
      provided that when reproducing Contributions, trademark and
      service mark identifiers used in the Contribution, including TM
      and (R), will be preserved.

5.4.  Sublicenses by IETF Trust
   The IETF Trust will sublicense the rights granted to it under Section



Bradner & Contreras                                             [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              RFC 3978-incoming              24 March 2008


   5.3 to all IETF participants for use within the IETF Standards
   Process.  This license is expressly granted under a license agreement
   issued by the IETF Trust and must contain a pointer to the full IETF
   Trust agreement.

   In addition, the IETF Trust may grant additional sublicenses of the
   licenses granted to it hereunder.  In doing so, the IETF Trust will
   comply with the guidance provided under RFC xxx [-outbound].

5.5.  No Patent License
   The licenses granted in Section 5.3 shall not be deemed to grant any
   right under any patent, patent application or other similar
   intellectual property right disclosed by the Contributor under BCP 79
   or otherwise.

5.6. Representations and Warranties
   With respect to each Contribution, each Contributor represents that
   to the best of his or her knowledge and ability:

   a. The Contribution properly acknowledges all Contributors including
      Indirect Contributors.
   b. No information in the Contribution is confidential and the IETF,
      IETF Trust, ISOC, and its affiliated organizations may freely
      disclose any information in the Contribution.
   c. There are no limits to the Contributor's ability to make the
      grants, acknowledgments and agreements herein that are reasonably
      and personally known to the Contributor.
   d. The Contributor has not intentionally included in the Contribution
      any material which is defamatory or untrue or which is illegal
      under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Contributor has
      his or her principal place of business or residence.
   e. All trademarks, trade names, service marks and other proprietary
      names used in the Contribution that are reasonably and personally
      known to the Contributor are clearly designated as such where
      reasonable.

5.7. No Duty to Publish
   The Contributor, and each named co-Contributor, acknowledges that the
   IETF has no duty to publish or otherwise use or disseminate any
   Contribution. The IETF reserves the right to withdraw or cease using
   any Contribution that does not comply with the requirements of this
   Section 5.

5.8. Trademarks
   Contributors who claim trademark rights in terms used in their IETF
   Contributions are requested to state specifically what conditions
   apply to implementers of the technology relative to the use of such
   trademarks. Such statements should be submitted in the same way as is

   done for other intellectual property claims. (See [RFC3979] Section
   6.)

5.9.  Copyright in RFCs
   Subject to each Contributor's (or its sponsor's) ownership of its
   underlying Contributions as described in Section 5.6(which ownership
   is qualified by the irrevocable licenses granted under Section 5.3),
   each Contributor hereby acknowledges that the copyright in any RFC in
   which such Contribution is included, other than an RFC that is an RFC
   Editor Contribution, shall be owned by the IETF Trust.   Such
   Contributor shall be deemed to assign to the IETF Trust such
   Contributor's copyright interest in the collective work constituting
   such RFC upon the submission of such RFC for publication, and
   acknowledges that a copyright notice acknowledging the IETF Trust's
   ownership of the copyright in such RFC will be included in the
   published RFC.

5.10. Contributors retention of rights
   Although Contributors provide specific rights to the IETF, it is not
   intended that this should deprive them of their right to exploit
   their Contributions. To underscore this principle, the IETF Trust is
   directed to issue a license or assurance to Contributors which
   confirms that they may each make use of their Contributions as
   published in an RFC in any way they wish, subject only to the
   restriction that no Contributor has the right to represent any
   document as an RFC, or equivalent of an RFC, if it is not a full and
   complete copy or translation of the published RFC.

6. Legends, Notices and Other Standardized Text in IETF Documents
   The IETF requires that certain standardized text be reproduced
   verbatim in certain IETF Documents (including copies, derivative
   works and translations of IETF Documents).  Some of this standardized
   text may be mandatory (e.g., copyright notices and disclaimers that
   must be included in all RFCs) and some may be optional (e.g.,
   limitations on the right to make derivative works).  The text itself,
   as well as the rules that explain when and how it must be used, are
   contained in the Legend Instructions.  The Legend Instructions may be
   updated from time to time, and the version of the standardized text
   that must be included in IETF Documents is that which was posted in
   the Legend Instructions on the date of publication.

   The IETF reserves the right to refuse to publish Contributions that
   do not include the legends and notices required by the Legend
   Instructions.

   It is important to note that each Contributor grants the IETF Trust
   rights pursuant to this document and the policies described herein.
   The legends and notices included in certain written Contributions

   such as Internet-Drafts do not themselves convey any rights.  They
   are simply included to inform the reader (whether or not part of the
   IETF) about certain legal rights and limitations associated with such
   documents.

   It is also important to note that additional copyright notices are
   not permitted in IETF Documents except in the case where such
   document is the product of a joint development effort between the
   IETF and another standards development organization or the document
   is a republication of the work of another standards development
   organization.  Such exceptions must be approved on an individual
   basis by the IAB.

IANA Considerations (RFC Editor - please remove this section when
   publishing)
   This document presents no issues that should be considered by the
   IANA (this section is here to mollify the ID-nits checker)

7. Security Considerations
   This memo relates to IETF process, not any particular technology.
   There are security considerations when adopting any technology, but
   there are no known issues of security with IETF Contribution rights
   policies.

   The editors would like to acknowledge the help of the IETF IPR
   Working Group provided during the development of the document.

10. Changes since RFF 3978
   This document represents a significant reorganization and rewording
   of RFC 3978 along with a number of substantive changes.

   The most basic change is to limit this document to the rights that a
   Contributor grants to the IETF Trust when making a Contribution.  All
   sublicenses of rights for the use of IETF Documents must be provided
   by the IETF Trust.  (See Section 5.4.)

   Material added from RFC 4748 that recognized the IETF Trust.

   Most of the material relating to RFC-Editor documents has been
   removed since the RFC-Editor maintains their own rules and processes
   for RFC-Editor documents.

   Changes in the definitions section include defining the terms
   "Contribution," "Indirect Contributor," "Copyright," "IETF Trust,"
   and "Legend Instructions" as well as minor tweaks to some of the
   other definitions.

   The responsibility for the text of notices has been given to the IETF
   Trust and removed from this document.  (See Section 6.)

   Clarified that Contributors enter into a legally binding contract
   when they submit a Contribution. (See Section 5.1.)

   The right to produce derivative works provided by the Contributor to
   the IETF Trust is not limited to being within the IETF Standards
   Process.

   Made it clear that this document does not deal with patent licenses.
   (See Section 5.5.)

   Clarified the ownership of the Copyrights to IETF Documents.  (See
   Section 5.9.)

   Clarified the rights retained by authors of IETF Contributions.  (See
   Section 5.10.)
