Abstract

   A dictionary-based key exchange protocol is proposed.  Two mobile
   host users that physically meet each other can use this protocol to
   authenticate each other.  PKI nor certificates are not needed.

1.  Introduction

   A dictionary-based key exchange protocol is proposed.  Two mobile
   host users that physically meet each other can use this protocol to
   authenticate each other.  PKI nor certificates are not needed.


2.  Protocol description

   The proposed protocol is briefly described below:


          Initiator              MitM                 Responder

                     Request RSA public key PK
           ----------------------------------------------->
                                  PK
         | <--------------------------------------------
      T  |
         | <========== Read 40-bit fingerprint ============
   human verification
   of 40-bit fingerprint

           -----------------{secret key}PK --------------->

   where
           PK: a one time RSA public key
           ===: voice channel, i.e. responder user tells the fingerprint
                to the initiator user through oral communication.
           MitM: Man in the Middle

                                 Figure 1

   The octets of the fingerprint will typically be mapped to a
   dictionary of easy to pronounce and type well-known words.  For
   example, with a dictionary containing 256 words, each octet can be
   represented with one word in the dictionary, and only 40/8=5 words
   need to be checked.

   In T time units, MitM has to find a PK' giving the same fingerprint
   as PK, and return it to the initiator before PK. 2^40 is large
   enough to assume that the attacker cannot reasonably succeed.


3.  Security considerations

   TBD.

4.  IANA considerations

   None.


5.  Conclusion

   This document described a dictionary-based key exchange protocol.
   The idea of human verification of a public key fingerprint is not
   new.  A 40-bit fingerprint is normally too short and considered
   insecure (See for example [SB].).  In the proposed protocol, however,
   the fingerprint is used to authenticate a one-time public key that is
   used to exchange a secret key and possibly other material.
