                     ALTO Deployment Considerations
                 draft-stiemerling-alto-deployments-00

Abstract

   Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as
   pieces of information or server processes, which are available in
   several equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but
   is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal
   of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
   guidance to these applications, which have to select one or several
   hosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired
   resource.  The protocol is under specification in the ALTO working
   group.  However, this document discusses the deployment
   considerations of ALTO and also some preliminary security
   considerations.

1.  Introduction

   Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as
   pieces of information or server processes, which are available in
   several equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but
   is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal
   of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
   guidance to applications, which have to select one or several hosts
   from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired
   resource.  The basic ideas of ALTO are described in the problem space
   of ALTO is described in [RFC5693] and the set of requirements is
   discussed in [I-D.kiesel-alto-reqs].

   However, there are no considerations about what issues are to be
   expected once ALTO will be deployed.  This includes, but is not
   limited to, location of the ALTO server, imposed load to the ALTO
   server, or from whom the queries are performed.

   Comments and discussions about this memo should be directed to the
   ALTO working group: alto@ietf.org.

2.  Overview

   The ALTO protocol is a client/server protocol, operating between a
   number of ALTO clients and an ALTO server, as sketched in Figure 1.

   The ALTO working groups defines the ALTO protocol based on the P4P
   proposal [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol], but there are also other past and
   current protocol proposals, such as, H12 [I-D.kiesel-alto-h12], or
   the oracle approach [I-D.akonjang-alto-proxidor] the infoexport
   approach [I-D.shalunov-alto-infoexport].  Irrespectivelty of all
   mentioned protocols, the common set is always where the ALTO server
   is located an who is actually the querying entity to that ALTO
   server.

                Figure 1: Network Overview of ALTO Protocol

   An ALTO server stores information about preferences (e.g., a list of
   preferred autonomous systems, IP ranges, etc) and ALTO clients can
   retrieve these preferences.  However, there are basically two
   different approaches on where the preferences are actually processed:

   1.  The ALTO server has a list of preferences and clients can
       retrieve this list via the ALTO protocol.  This preference list
       can be partially updated by the server.  The actual processing of
       the data is done on the client and thus there is no data of the
       client's operation revealed to the ALTO server .  This approach
       has been proposed by [I-D.shalunov-alto-infoexport].

   2.  The ALTO server has a list of preferences or preferences
       calculated during runtime and the ALTO client is sending

       information of its operation (e.g., a list of IP addresses) to
       the server.  The server is using this operational information to
       determine its preferences and returns these preferences (e.g., a
       sorted list of the IP addresses) back to the ALTO client.  This
       approach has been initially described in [ACM.ispp2p], but never
       been described on the protocol level.

   Approach 1 (we call it H1) has the advantage (seen from the client)
   that all operational information stays within the client and is not
   revealed to the provider of the server.  On the other hand, does
   approach 1 require that the provider of the ALTO server, i.e., the
   network operator, reveals information about its network structure
   (e.g., AS numbers, IP ranges, topology information in general) to the
   ALTO client.

   Approach 2 (we call it H2) has the advantage (seen from the operator)
   that all operational information stays with the ALTO server and is
   not revealed to the ALTO client.  On the other hand, does approach 2
   require that the clients send their operational information to the
   server.

   Both approaches have their pros and cons and are extensively
   discussed on the ALTO mailing list.  But there is basically a
   dilemma: Approach 1 is seen as the only working solution by peer-to-
   peer software vendors and approach 2 is seen as the only working by
   the network operators.  But neither the software vendors nor the
   operators seem to willing to change their position.  However, there
   is the need to get both sides on board, to come to a solution.

   actually located, i.e., if the tracker and the ALTO server are in the
   same ISP's domain, or if the tracker and the ALTO server are managed/
   owned/located in different domains.  The latter is the typical use
   case, e.g., taking Pirate Bay as example that serves Bittorrent users
   world-wide.

   Figure Figure 3 shows the operational model for applications that do
   not use a tracker, such as, edonky, or in if the tracker should be
   the queriyng party.  This use case also holds true for CDNs.  The
   ALTO server can also be queried by CDNs to get a guidance about where
   the a particular client accessing data in the CDN is excatly located
   in the ISP's network.

3.  Placement of ALTO Server

   This section discuss where the ALTO server can be placed and which
   entities are querying the ALTO server from what ALTO client.  The
   section assumes a P2P system relying a tracker to initially find
   other peers.  However, the tracker can be replaced by any other
   database that provides a rendezvous point for an application.  The
   limitation to a tracker is made for educational purpose, i.e. to ease
   the general understanding.

      Figure 4: Global tracker accessing ALTO server at various ISPs

   Figure Figure 4 depicts a tracker-based system, where the tracker
   embeds the ALTO client.  The tracker itself is hosted and operated by
   an entity different than the ISP hosting and operating the ALTO
   server.  Initially, the tracker has to look-up the ALTO server in
   charge for each peer where it receives a ALTO query for.  Therefore,
   the ALTO server has to discover the handling ALTO server, as
   described in [I-D.kiesel-alto-3pdisc].  However, the peers do not
   have any way to query the server themselves.  This setting allows to
   give the peers a better selection of candidate peers for their
   operation at an initial time, but does not consider peers learned
   through direct peer-to-peer knowledge exchange, AKA peer exchange in
   various peer-to-peer protocols.

               Figure 5: Global Tracker - Local ALTO Servers

   The scenario in Figure Figure 5 lets the peers directly communicate
   with their ISP's ALTO server (i.e., ALTO client embedded in the
   peers), giving thus the peers the most control on which information
   they query for, as they can integrate information received from
   trackers and through direct eer-to-peer knowledge exchange.

      Figure 6: P4P approach with local tracker and local ALTO server

   There are some attempts to let ISP's to deploy their own trackers, as
   shown in Figure 6.  In this case, the client has no chance to get
   guidance from the ALTO server, other than talking to the ISP's
   tracker.  However, the peers would have still chance the contact
   other trackers, deployed by entities other than the peer's ISP.

   The figures Figure 6 and Figure 4 ostensibly take peers the
   possibility to directly query the ALTO server, if the communication
   with the ALTO server is not permitted for any reason.  However,
   considering the plethora of different applications of ALTO, e.g.,
   multiple tracker and non-tracker based P2P systems and or
   applications searching for relays, it seems to be beneficial for all
   participants to let the peers directly query the ALTO server.  The
   peers are also the single point having all operational knowledge to
   decide whether to use the ALTO guidance and how to use the ALTO
   guidance.  This is a preference for the scenario depicted in Figure
   Figure 5.

4.  API between ALTO Client and Application

   This sections gives some informational guidance on how the interface
   between the actual application using the ALTO guidance and the ALTO
   client can look like.

   This is still TBD.

5.  Security Considerations

   The ALTO protocol itself, as well as, the ALTO client and server
   raise new security issues beyond the one mentioned in
   [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] and issues related to message transport over
   the Internet.  For instance, Denial of Service (DoS) is of interest
   for the ALTO server and also for the ALTO client.  A server can get
   overloaded if too many TCP requests hit the server, or if the query
   load of the server surpasses the maximum computing capacity.  An ALTO
   client can get overloaded if the responses from the sever are, either
   intentionally or due to an implementation mistake, too large to be
   handled by that particular client.

5.1.  Information Leakage from the ALTO Server

   The ALTO server will be provisioned with information about the owning
   ISP's network and very likely also with information about neighboring
   ISPs.  This information (e.g., network topology, business relations,
   etc) is consider to be confidential to the ISP and must not be
   revealed.

   The ALTO server will naturally reveal parts of that information in
   small doses to peers, as the guidance given will depend on the above
   mentioned information.  This is seen beneficial for both parties,
   i.e., the ISP's and the peer's.  However, there is the chance that
   one or multipe peers are querying an ALTO server with the goal to
   gather information about network topology or any other data
   considered confidential or at least sensitive.  It is unclear whether
   this is a real technical security risk or whether this is more a
   perceived security risk.

5.2.  ALTO Server Access

   Depending on the use case of ALTO, several access restrictions to an
   ALTO server may or may not apply.  For an ALTO server that is solely
   accessible by peers from the ISP network (as shown in Figure 5), for
   instance, the source IP address can be used to grant only access from
   that ISP network to the server.  This will "limit" the number of
   peers able to attack the server to the user's of the ISP (however,
   including botnet computers).

   On the other hand, if the ALTO server has to be accessible by parties
   not located in the ISP's network (see Figure Figure 4), e.g., by a
   third-party tracker or by a CDN system outside the ISP's network, the
   access restrictions have to be more loose.  In the extreme case,
   i.e., no access restrictions, each and every host in the Internet can
   access the ALTO server.  This might no the intention of the ISP, as
   the server is not only subjec to more possible attacks, but also on

   the load imposed to the server, i.e., possibly more ALTO clients to
   serve and thus more work load.

5.3.  Faking ALTO Guidance

   It has not yet been investigated how a faked or wrong ALTO guidance
   by an ALTO server can impact the operation of the network and also
   the peers.

   Here is a list of examples how the ALTO guidance could be faked and
   what possible consequences may arise:

   Sorting  An attacker could change to sorting order of the ALTO
      guidance (given that the order is of importance, otherwise the
      ranking mechanism is of interest), i.e., declaring peers located
      outside the ISP as peers to be preferred.  This will not pose a
      big risk to the network or peers, as it would mimic the "regular"
      peer operation without traffic localization, apart from the
      communication/processing overhead for ALTO.  However, it could
      mean that ALTO is reaching the opposite goal of shuffling more
      data across ISP boundaries, incurring more costs for the ISP.

   Preference of a single peer  A single IP address (thus a peer) could
      be marked as to be preferred all over other peers.  This peer can
      be located within the local ISP or also in other parts of the
      Internet (e.g., a web server).  This could lead to the case that
      quite a number of peers to trying to contact this IP address,
      possibly causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

   This section is solely giving a first shot on security issues related
   to ALTO deployments.

6.  Conclusion

   This is the first version of the deployment considerations and for
   sure the considerations are yet incomplete and imprecise.

   The first two figures have been deliberately taken from the
   requirements draft.
