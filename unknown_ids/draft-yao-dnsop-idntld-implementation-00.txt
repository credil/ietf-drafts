Abstract

   ICANN is pushing the IDN TLD into the root server.  Some IDN TLD has
   the variants.  Currently, there are two proposals to implement the
   IDN TLD variants in the root servers:1, implement it with the DNAME
   record; 2, implement it with NS record.  The IDN TLD variants may be
   reserved or activated.  If the IDN TLD variants are activated, these
   variants will be allocated to the same TLD manager in order to avoid
   the possible phishing problems.  How to deal with the IDN TLD variant
   issue is a big challenge ahead of us.  This document discusses the
   IDN TLD variants implementation issues related with DNAME and NS
   resource record way.  This memo also gives a proposal about how to
   avoid the possible phishing problem after putting the IDN TLD
   variants into the root.

1.  Introduction

   ICANN is pushing the IDN TLD into the root server.  Some IDN TLD has
   the variants.  Currently, there are two proposals to implement the
   IDN TLD variants in the root servers:1, implement it with the DNAME
   record; 2, implement it with NS record.  The IDN TLD variants may be
   reserved or activated.  If IDN TLD variants are activated, these
   variants will be allocated to the same TLD manager in order to avoid
   the possible phishing problems.  How to deal with the IDN TLD variant
   issue is a big challenge ahead of us.  This document discusses the
   IDN TLD implementation issues related with DNAME and NS resource
   record way.  This memo also gives a proposal about how to avoid the
   possible phishing problem after putting the IDN TLD variants into the
   root.

1.1.  Terminology

   All the basic terms used in this specification are defined in the
   documents [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC2672], [RFC3490] and [RFC3743].
   Understanding of the [RFC2672] and [RFC3743] is necessary to
   understand this document.  In particular, the term "variant" is
   defined in section 1.3.2 of [RFC4290]. the "normal domain name" is
   the domain name which can be configured with the DNS Resource Record
   directly.


2.  IDN TLD Variant

   In ASCII [ASCII] letters, the upper case "A" and lower case 'a' are
   same in the meaning.  In many cases, the upper case "A" and lower
   case 'a' are exchangeable.  We can regard the upper case "A" as the
   variant of the lower case 'a'.  In some languages, some characters
   has the variants, which look differently or very similar but are
   identical in the meaning.  For example, Chinese character U+56FD and
   its variant U+570B look differently, but are identical in the
   meaning.  If Internationalized Domain Label" or "IDL" [RFC3743] are
   composed of variant characters, we regard this kind of IDL as the IDL
   variant.  If these IDL variants are put into the root, they are
   regarded as the IDN TLD variants.  For example, if the IDL "China"
   (U+4E2D U+56FD) and its IDL variant (U+4E2D U+570B) are put into the
   root, the first one (U+4E2D U+56FD) is called as the original IDN TLD
   and the second one (U+4E2D U+570B) is called as the IDN TLD variant.
   In ideal way, the original IDN TLD and its IDN TLD variant SHOULD be
   identical in the DNS resolution.  For example, the ".com" is
   identical to ".COM" in the DNS resolution.  Currently, we can not
   find the ideal solution for the IDN TLD variants.  Two proposals are
   suggested to solve the problem: DNAME record and NS record.

3.  DNAME

   A DNAME record is defined in [RFC2672].  DNAME provides redirection
   from a part of the DNS name tree to another part of the DNS name
   tree.  DNAME does not direct itself (the owner name).  The basic DNS
   documents [RFC1034] and [RFC1035] were defined in the year of 1987
   while the DNAME [RFC2672] was defined in the year of 1999.  There are
   12 years gap between them.  So there are a lot of legacy DNS
   applications which are unaware of DNAME.  DNAME protocol itself also
   has some kind of problems.

3.1.  Domain Name Resolution Failure

   The Section 4.1 of [RFC2672] specifies that DNS clients sending
   Extended DNS [EDNS0] queries with Version 0 or non-extended queries
   are presumed not to understand the semantics of the DNAME record, so
   a server which implements this DNAME specification , when answering a
   non-extended query or the query with the Extended DNS Version 0
   [EDNS0], SHOULD synthesize a CNAME record for each DNAME record
   encountered during query processing.  This means that the synthesized
   CNAME record is not always provided.  If there has the Extended DNS
   queries with Version 1 (EDNS1) in future, the resolver with EDNS1
   query may not support DNAME and the synthesized CNAME may not
   provided.  This can be regarded as the hole of original DNAME
   specification.  The [RFC2672bis] has updated it to "A CNAME RR with
   TTL equal to the corresponding DNAME RR is synthesized and included
   in the answer section for resolvers that did not indicate
   understanding of DNAME in queries."  There are many legacy DNS
   applications and resolvers which do not support DNAME.  If the
   synthesized CNAME resource record is not provided to these
   applications or resolvers, the relative domain name under the DNAME
   owner will not be resolved.  It is unsafe to use the DNAME for some
   very import domain name since there is an potential possibility that
   the domain name may be unavailable to the internet users.  In other
   side, whether the DNAME-unaware cache server can provide the
   synthesized CNAME to the DNAME-unaware resolvers are not clear.  If
   it can not, it will also cause some domain name resolving failure.

3.2.  Zero TTL

   The section 4.1 of [RFC2672] specifies that the synthesized CNAME RR,
   if provided, MUST have TTL equal to zero.  It means that the DNAME-
   unaware resolver will not cache this resource record.  The DNAME-
   unaware resolver will go to other servers to lookup the relative
   answers every time when the DNAME record is involved.  This will
   cause much load to the servers which provide the DNAME service.  The
   [RFC2672bis] has updated it to " A CNAME RR with TTL equal to the
   corresponding DNAME RR is synthesized and included in the answer

   section for resolvers that did not indicate understanding of DNAME in
   queries."  In the current implementation based on [RFC2672], the TTL
   for synthesized CNAME Resource record is 0, which means there will be
   no cache in the resolvers.  So every query from DNAME-unaware
   resolvers has to go to the DNS servers which provide the DNAME
   service.  This will cause a big load to the DNAME DNS servers.

3.3.  Mis-configuration

   DNAME RFC specifies that resource records MUST NOT exist at any sub-
   domain of the owner of a DNAME RR.  Some DNS administrators may not
   know it and still configure the RR in the sub-domain of the owner of
   a DNAME RR, which may lead the failure resolving.  The DNAMEed domain
   name is not a normal domain name.  The normal domain name itself can
   be configured with the DNS resource record such as A or MX record.
   Many DNS administrators will mis-configure it.  The registrant of
   this domain name may not understand the DNAME and regard the DNAMEed
   domain name as the normal domain name.


4.  NS Resource Record

   The NS record is defined in the basic DNS documents [RFC1034] and
   [RFC1035].  NS resource record is deployed widely.  If IDN TLD
   variants are delegated via the NS resource record way, the original
   IDN TLD and its variants can be delegated to totally different
   servers.  In the DNS zone, they are the different domain names.


5.  IDN TLD variants implementation guideline

5.1.  The principle of IDN TLD variants implementation

   In ideal way, the original IDN TLD and its variant ones SHOULD be
   identical in the DNS resolution, such as ".com"== ".COM".  Any policy
   or technology SHOULD be used to guarantee that the IDN TLD and its
   variant SHOULD belong to the same registry; the DNS administrators
   SHOULD try their best to make the IDN TLD and its variants be
   identical in the DNS resolution.  There have 2 ways to deal with it.
   In technique, the DNS operators may use some technology to implement
   it; In policy, the DNS administrators can use some management policy
   or some guideline to make the original IDN TLD and its variants be
   identical in the DNS resolution.  If the IDN TLD and its variants are
   delegated to different registry, it will cause phishing problems.  In
   order to avoid the possible phishing, these IDN TLD SHOULD be
   delegated to the same registry.  Based on the current technology,
   there are two technique: DNAME and NS records which can be used in
   the IDN TLD variants implementation.  The following section will

Internet-Draft                     tld                      October 2009


   discuss the usage of DNAME and NS resource records, and its relative
   policy to manage the IDN TLD and its variants.

5.2.  IDN TLD variants in the root

5.2.1.  DNAME is not proper for IDN TLD variants

   If the DNAME is implemented into the IDN TLD variants, some domain
   names may not be resolved by the DNAME unaware resolvers.  The
   synthesized CNAME RR for the DNAME has the TTL Zero, which will cause
   too much load to the root servers since many DNAME-unaware resolvers
   will not cache the synthesized CNAME RR for the DNAME and lookup from
   the root when they receive the requests related to DNAME.  The easy
   mis-configuration problem by the DNS administrator is also a problem
   to make the DNS administrators and the registrant be confused about
   the domain name availability.  So the problems above make the DNAME
   un-proper for applying the DNAME to IDN TLD variants.

5.2.2.  NS is good for IDN TLD variants

   The DNS administrators can apply NS records to IDN TLD variants.  In
   registration policy, the original IDN TLD and its IDN TLD variants
   SHOULD be allocated to the same registrant.  For the DNS
   administration, the configuration of the original IDN TLD and its
   variant SHOULD be same.  That is that any parameters or configuration
   applied to the original IDN TLD SHOULD be available to its variants.
   This can guarantee that the resolution in the root for the IDN TLD
   and its variants are identical.

5.3.  The second level names under the IDN TLD variants

   Whether DNAME or NS is used for the IDN TLD and its variants, the DNS
   administrator can consider three factors:
   o  Are IDN TLD variants often used or resolved by the internet users?
   o  DNS servers' performance?
   o  The DNS administrators' knowledge of DNAME?

5.3.1.  Apply DNAME

   If some of the following criterias are satisfied, we can consider to
   use the DNAME in the second level domain names.
   o  The IDN TLD variants are seldom used or resolved by the internet
      users and the owner of the domain name can bear its potential
      resolving failure
   o  The DNS servers' performance is good enough to support a lot of
      resolution from the DNAME-unaware resolvers

Internet-Draft                     tld                      October 2009


   o  The DNS administrator has the knowledge of DNAME, and can
      configure it properly
   We can use the following configuration form:

     [the IDN TLD variants] DNAME TTL IN [the original IDN TLD]

   Since the owner of DNAME does not redirect itself, the other RR
   records except NS DNAME records under the IDN TLD variants SHOULD be
   same with the original IDN TLD in the DNS administration.

5.3.2.  Apply NS

   If some of the following criterias are satisfied, we can consider to
   use the NS in the second level domain names.
   o  The IDN TLD variants are often used or resolved by the internet
      users and the owner of the domain name can not bear the possible
      resolving failure
   o  The DNS servers' performance is not good enough to support a lot
      of resolution from the DNAME-unaware resolvers
   o  The DNS administrator has not the knowledge of DNAME, and can not
      configure it properly
   In order to avoid the possible phishing or confusing, the
   configuration of names under the original IDN TLD and its variant
   SHOULD be same in the DNS administration.  That is that any
   parameters or configuration applied to the names of the original IDN
   TLD SHOULD be available to the names of its variants.  This can
   guarantee that the resolutions in the IDN TLD and its variants are
   identical.


6.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration.


7.  Security Considerations

   If IDN TLD variants are implemented, this guideline is suggested to
   be used to avoid the possible phishing


8.  Acknowledgements

   Some ideas are discussed in the ICANN IDN variant working group.
   Some nice comments are from Harald Alvestrand in this group.  Thanks
   a lot to Sun Guonian for his helpful discussion with me about DNAME
   technology.
