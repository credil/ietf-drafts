                  IMAP4 Multimailbox SEARCH Extension
                 draft-ietf-morg-multimailbox-search-02

Abstract

   The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selected
   mailbox.  A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a
   client that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and
   SEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the
   next.  This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes
   with one command, limiting the round-trips and waiting for various
   searches to complete, and not requiring disruption of the currently
   selected mailbox.  This also uses MAILBOX and TAG fields in ESEARCH
   responses, allowing a client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.

Note

   A revised version of this draft document will be submitted to the RFC
   editor as a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community.  Discussion
   and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to
   morg@ietf.org.

Internet-Draft     IMAP4 Multimailbox SEARCH Extension     February 2010


1.  Introduction

   The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selected
   mailbox.  A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a
   client that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and
   SEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the
   next.  The commands can't be pipelined, because the server might run
   them in parallel, and the untagged SEARCH responses could not then be
   distinguished from each other.

   This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes with one
   command, and includes MAILBOX and TAG fields in the ESEARCH response,
   yielding the following advantages:

   o  A single command limits the number of round-trips needed to search
      a set of mailboxes.

   o  A single command eliminates the need to wait for one search to
      complete before starting the next.

   o  A single command allows the server to optimize the search, if it
      can.

   o  A command that is not dependent upon the selected mailbox
      eliminates the need to disrupt the selection state, or to open
      another IMAP connection.

   o  The MAILBOX and TAG fields in the responses allow a client to
      distinguish which responses go with which search (and which
      mailbox).  A client can safely pipeline these search commands
      without danger of confusion.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   In examples, "C:" indicates lines sent by a client that is connected
   to a server.  "S:" indicates lines sent by the server to the client.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft     IMAP4 Multimailbox SEARCH Extension     February 2010


   Arguments:  OPTIONAL source options
               OPTIONAL result options
               OPTIONAL charset specification (see [RFC2978])
               searching criteria (one or more)

   Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: SEARCH or ESEARCH

   Result:     OK - search completed
               NO - error: cannot search that charset or criteria
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

   This section further updates definition of the SEARCH command
   described in section 2.6.1 of [RFC4466] (initially described in
   section 6.4.4 of [RFC3501] and extended by [RFC4731]).

   The SEARCH command is extended to allow for optional source and
   result options.  This document does not define any new result options
   (see Section 3.1 of [RFC4731]).  A server that supports this
   extension includes [[fix-for-pub-1: "X-DRAFT-I03-MMBX" (changes for
   publication)]] in its IMAP capability string.

2.1.  The ESEARCH response

   Unless specified otherwise by a description of a result option, in
   the presence of a search source option the server MUST return ESEARCH
   responses [RFC4731] instead of the corresponding SEARCH responses.
   Because message numbers are not useful for mailboxes that are not
   selected, each ESEARCH response MUST return information about UIDs,
   not message numbers, regardless of whether it is in response to a
   SEARCH or a UID SEARCH command.  In particular, the responses MUST
   contain the UID indicator.  This is true even if the source options
   specify that only the selected mailbox be searched.

   Presence of a source option in absence of a result option implies the
   "ALL" result option (see Section 3.1 of [RFC4731]).  Note that this
   is not the same as the result from the SEARCH command described in
   the IMAP base protocol.

   Source options describe which mailboxes must be searched for
   messages.  A SEARCH/UID SEARCH command with source options does not
   affect which mailbox, if any, is currently selected, regardless of
   which mailboxes are searched.

   For each mailbox satisfying the source options, a single ESEARCH
   response MUST be returned if any messages in that mailbox match the
   search criteria.  An ESEARCH respoonse SHOULD NOT [[Barry: Why not
   MUST NOT ?]] be returned for mailboxes that contain no matching
   messages.  This is true even when result options such as MIN, MAX,

Internet-Draft     IMAP4 Multimailbox SEARCH Extension     February 2010


   and COUNT are specified (see section 3.1 of [RFC4731]), and the
   values returned (lowest UID matched, highest UID matched, and number
   of messages matched, respectively) apply to the mailbox reported in
   that ESEARCH response.

   Note that it is now possible for a SEARCH command to return NO
   untagged responses (no SEARCH nor ESEARCH responses), in the case
   that there are no matches to the search in any of the mailboxes that
   satisfy the source options.  Clients can detect this situation by
   finding the tagged OK response without having received any matching
   untagged ESEARCH responses.

   Each ESEARCH response MUST contain the MAILBOX, TAG, and UIDVALIDITY
   correlators.  Correlators allow clients to issue several SEARCH/UID
   SEARCH commands at once (pipelined).  The server MAY perform
   pipelined searches in parallel; or it MAY instead serialize them.

2.2.  Source options -- specifying mailboxes to search

   The source options, if present, MUST contain a mailbox specifier as
   defined in the IMAP NOTIFY extension [RFC5465], section 6 (using the
   "filter-mailboxes" ABNF item), with the following changes:

   1.  The "selected-delayed" specifier is not valid here.

   2.  A "subtree-one" specifier is added.  The "subtree" specifier
       results in a search of the specified mailbox and all selectable
       mailboxes that are subordinate to it, through an indefinitely
       deep hierarchy.  The "subtree-one" specifier results in a search
       of the specified mailbox and all selectable child mailboxes, one
       hierarchy level down.

   If "subtree" is specified, the server MUST defend against loops in
   the hierarchy (for example, those caused by recursive file-system
   links within the message store).  The server SHOULD do this by
   keeping track of the mailboxes that have been searched, and
   terminating the hierarchy traversal when a repeat is found.  If it
   can not do that, it MAY do it by limiting the hierarchy depth.

   If the source options are not present, the value "selected" is
   assumed -- that is, only the currently selected mailbox is searched.

   The "personal" source option is a particularly convenient way to
   search all of the current user's mailboxes.  Note that there is no
   way to use wildcard characters to search all mailboxes; the
   "mailboxes" source option does not do wildcard expansion.

   If the source options include (or default to) "selected", the IMAP

Internet-Draft     IMAP4 Multimailbox SEARCH Extension     February 2010


   session MUST be in "selected" state.  If the source options specify
   other mailboxes and NOT "selected", then the IMAP session MUST be in
   either "selected" or "authenticated" state.  If the session is not in
   a correct state, the SEARCH command returns a "BAD" result.

   If the server supports the ACL [RFC4314] extension, then the logged
   in user is required to have the 'r' right for each mailbox she wants
   to search.  Mailboxes matching the source options for which the
   logged in user has no 'r' right MUST be ignored by a multimailbox
   search.  In particular, ESEARCH responses MUST NOT be returned for
   those mailboxes.


3.  Open Issues

   [[Issues: This is a section of To-Do items and considerations before
   this draft is done.  This section will be worked through, emptied,
   and removed before we send this on.]]

   The Security Considerations section needs to be written.

   Interaction with IMAP Contexts [RFC5267] needs to be defined.

   Suggestion: UPDATE option of IMAP Notify [RFC5465] might have to be
   prohibited when both Context and this extension are used.  [Barry:
   But why?  Isn't this then the equivalent of doing many SEARCH
   commands with the UPDATE option?]

   There's a suggestion to add an EXCLUDE clause (with a nested search
   criteria).  For example, one might want to search "personal" but
   exclude "mailboxes (Trash Spam)".

   Cyrus suggests you can use metadata to tag mailboxes that you do or
   don't want to search, and use search criteria to exclude them (good
   for mailboxes that you NEVER want searched (as Trash and Spam,
   above)).


4.  Examples

   C: tag1 SEARCH IN ((mailboxes "folder1" subtree "folder2")) unseen
   C: tag2 SEARCH IN ((mailboxes "folder1" subtree-one "folder2"))
   subject "chad"
   S: * ESEARCH (TAG "tag1" MAILBOX "folder1" UIDVALIDITY 1) UID ALL
   4001,4003,4005,4007,4009
   S: * ESEARCH (TAG "tag2" MAILBOX "folder1" UIDVALIDITY 6789023554)
   UID ALL 195001:195004,169788
   S: * ESEARCH (TAG "tag1" MAILBOX "folder2/banana" UIDVALIDITY 503)

6.  Security Considerations

   [[Security: This needs to be filled in.]]


7.  IANA Considerations

   IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a standards track or
   IESG approved experimental RFC.  The registry is currently located
   here:


      http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities


   This document defines the IMAP capability [[fix-for-pub-2: X-DRAFT-
   I03-MMBX (changes for publication)]], and IANA is asked to add it to
   the registry.
