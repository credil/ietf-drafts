1.  Introduction

   Autonomous System 0 is listed in the IANA Autonomous System Number
   Registry as "Reserved - May be use to identify non-routed networks"
   ([IANA.AS_Numbers]).

   [I-D.ietf-sidr-iana-objects] specifies that AS number zero in a ROA
   is used to mark an NLRI which is to be marked as Invalid.

   No clear statement that AS 0 was proscribed could be found in any BGP
   specification.

   As at least two implementations discard routes containing AS 0 (and
   to allow approaches such as the above) this document codifies this
   behavior.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Behavior

   This document specifies that a BGP speaker MUST NOT originate or
   propapate an announcement with an AS number of zero, and a BGP
   listener MUST NOT accept an announcement which has an AS number of
   zero in the AS-PATH attribute, and SHOULD log the fact that it has
   done so.

   In addition if a BGP listener recives zero as the peer AS in an OPEN
   message, it MUST abort the connection and send a NOTIFICATION with
   Error Code "OPEN Message Error" and subcode "Bad Peer AS" (see
   [RFC4271] Section 6.2).  Obviosuly enough, a router MUST NOT
   initialte a connection claiming to be AS number zero.


3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to update the Reference for number 0 in the
   "Autonomous System (AS) Numbers" registry to refernce this document.


4.  Security Considerations

   By allowing resource holders to say that AS 0 is the only valid
   origin for a route, we allow them to state that a particular address

   resource is not in use.  By ensuring that all implementations that
   see AS 0 in a route ignore that route, we prevent a malicious party
   from announcing routes containing AS 0 in an attempt to hijack those
   resources.

   In addition, by standardizing the behavior upon reception of an AS
   PATH containing AS 0, this document makes the behavior better
   defined, and security gotchas often lurk in the undefined spaces.
