      <t>This document provides a problem statement, lists requirements and captures design aspects
        for a Geopriv Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol L7 (LCP). This protocol aims to allow
        an end host to obtain location information, by value or by reference, from a Location
        Information Server (LIS) that is located in the access network. The obtained location
        information can then be used for a variety of different protocols and purposes. For example,
        it can be used as input to the Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) or to convey
        location within SIP to other entities.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document provides a problem statement, lists requirements and captures design aspects
        for a Geopriv Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol L7 (LCP). The protocol has two
        purposes:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>It is used to obtain location information (referred as "Location by Value" or LbyV)
            from a dedicated node, called the Location Information Server (LIS).</t>
          <t>It enables the Target to obtain a reference to location information (referred as
            "Location by Reference" or LbyR). This reference can take the form of a subscription
            URI, such as a SIP presence URI, a HTTP/HTTPS URI, or another URI. The requirements
            related to the task of obtaining a LbyR are described in a separate document, see <xref
              target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements"/>.</t>
        </list>The need for these two functions can be derived from the scenarios presented in <xref
          target="scenarios"/>. </t>
      <t>For this document we assume that the GEOPRIV Layer 7 LCP runs between the end host (i.e.,
        the Target in <xref target="RFC3693"/> terminology) and the LIS.</t>
      <t>This document is structured as follows. <xref target="discovery"/> discusses the challenge
        of discovering the LIS in the access network. <xref target="identifier"/> compares different
        types of identifiers that can be used to retrieve location information. A list of
        requirements for the L7 LCP can be found in <xref target="requirements"/>. </t>
      <t>This document does not describe how the access network provider determines the location of
        the end host since this is largely a matter of the capabilities of specific link layer
        technologies or certain deployment environments.</t>
    </section>
    <!-- **************************************************************************************** -->
    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
        described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>, with the qualification that unless otherwise
        stated these words apply to the design of the GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration
        Protocol.</t>
      <t> The term Location Information Server (LIS) refers to an entity capable of determining the
        location of a Target and of providing that location information, a reference to it, or both
        via the Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) to the requesting party. In most cases the
        requesting party is the Target itself but it may also be an authorized entity that acts on
        behalf of it, such as a SIP proxy or another LIS.</t>
      <t>This document also uses terminology from <xref target="RFC3693"/> (such as Target) and
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-requirements"/> (such as Internet Access Provider (IAP),
        Internet Service Provider (ISP), and Application Service Provider (ASP)).</t>
      <t>With the term "Access Network Provider" we refer to the Internet Access Provider (IAP) and
        the Internet Service Provider (ISP) without further distinguishing these two entities as it
        is not relevant for the purpose of this document. An additional requirements document on
        LIS-to-LIS <xref target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-lis2lis-req"/> shows scenario where the
        separation between IAP and ISP is important.</t>

      <t>This section describes a few network scenarios where the L7 LCP may be used. Note that this
        section does not aim to exhaustively list all possible deployment environments. Instead we

        <t> The customer premises consists of a router with a Network Address Translator with Port
          Address Translation (NAPT) and a DHCP server as used in most Customer Premises Networks
          (CPN) and the Network Termination Equipment (NTE) where Layer 1 and sometimes Layer 2
          protocols are terminated. The router in the home network (e.g., broadband router, cable or
          DSL router) typically runs a NAPT and a DHCP server. The NTE is a legacy device and in
          many cases cannot be modified for the purpose of delivering location information to the
          end host. The same is true of the device with the NAPT and DHCP server. </t>
        <t> It is possible for the NTE and the home router to physically be in the same box, or for
          there to be no home router, or for the NTE and end host to be in the same physical box
          (with no home router). An example of this last case is where Ethernet service is delivered
          to customers' homes, and the Ethernet NIC in their PC serves as the NTE.</t>
        <t> Current Customer Premises Network (CPN) deployments frequently show the following
          characteristics: </t>
        <t>
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>CPE = Single PC <list style="numbers">

                <t> with USB DSL or cable modem [PPPoA, PPPoE, or DHCP on PC]</t>
              </list> Note that the device with NAPT and DHCP of <xref target="dsl-figure"/> is not
              present in such a scenario. </t>
            <t>One or more hosts with at least one router (DHCP Client or PPPoE, DHCP server in
              router; VoIP can be soft client on PC, stand-alone VoIP device, or Analog Terminal
              Adaptor (ATA) function embedded in router)<list style="numbers">
                <t>combined router and NTE </t>
                <t>separate router with NTE in bridged mode </t>
                <t>separate router with NTE (NTE/router does PPPoE or DHCP to WAN, router provides
                  DHCP server for hosts in LAN; double NAT)</t>
              </list>
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t> The majority of fixed access broadband customers use a router. The placement of the VoIP
          client is mentioned to describe what sorts of hosts may need to be able to request
          location information. Soft clients on PCs are frequently not launched until long after
          bootstrap is complete, and are not able to control any options that may be specified
          during bootstrap. They also cannot control whether a VPN client is running on the end
          host. </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Moving Network">
        <t>An example of a moving network is a "WIMAX-like fixed wireless" scenario that is offered
          in several cities, like New Orleans, Biloxi, etc., where much of the communications
          infrastructure was destroyed due to a natural disaster. The customer-side antenna for this
          service is rather small (about the size of a mass market paperback book) and can be run
          off battery power. The output of this little antenna is a RJ-45 Ethernet jack. A laptop
          can be plugged into this Ethernet jack. The user would then run a PPPoE client to connect
          to the network. Once the network connection is established, the user can run a SIP client
          on the laptop.</t>
        <t> The network-side antenna is, for example, connected through ATM to the core network, and
          from there to the same BRASs that serve regular DSL customers. These Broadband Remote
          Access Servers (BRASs) terminate the PPPoE sessions, just like they do for regular DSL. </t>
        <t> The laptop and SIP client are, in this case, unaware that they are "mobile". All they
          see is an Ethernet connection, and the IP address they get from PPPoE does not change over
          the coverage area. Only the user and the network are aware of the laptop's mobility.</t>
        <t>Further examples of moving networks can be found in busses, trains, and airplanes. </t>

    <section anchor="discovery" title="Discovery of the Location Information Server">
      <t>When a Target wants to retrieve location information from the LIS it first needs to
        discover it. Based on the problem statement of determining the location of the Target, which
        is known best by entities close to the Target itself, we assume that the LIS is located in
        the local subnet or in access network. Several procedures have been investigated that aim to discover the LIS
        in such an access network.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="DHCP-based Discovery:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>In some environments the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
            (DHCP) might be a good choice for discovering the FQDN or the IP address of the LIS. In
            environments where DHCP can be used it is also possible to use the already defined
            location extensions. In environments with legacy devices, such as the one shown in <xref
              target="fixed-wireless"/>, a DHCP based discovery solution may not be possible.<vspace
              blankLines="1"/>
          </t>
          <t hangText="DNS-based Discovery:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>Before a DNS lookup can be started it is necessary to learn the 
            domain name of the access network that runs a LIS. Several ways to learn the domain name
            exist. For example, the end host obtains its own public IP address, for example via STUN 
            <xref target="RFC3489"/>, and performs a reverse DNS lookup (assuming the data is provisioned 
            into the DNS). Then, the SRV or NAPTR record for that domain is retrieved. 
            A more detailed description
            of this approach can be found in <xref target="I-D.thomson-geopriv-lis-discovery"
              />.<vspace blankLines="1"/>
          </t>
          <t hangText="Redirect Rule:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>A redirect rule at a device in the access network, for example
            at the AAA client, could be used to redirect the L7 LCP signalling messages (destined to
            a specific port) to the LIS. The end host could then discover the LIS by sending a
            packet with a specific (registered) port number to almost any address (as long as the destination IP address does not target a
            device in the local network). The packet would be redirected to the respective LIS being

            intercepted and redirected.<vspace blankLines="1"/> To some extend this approach is
            similar to packets that are marked with a Router Alert option <xref target="RFC2113"/>
            and intercepted by entities that understand the specific marking. In the above-mentioned
            case, however, the marking is provided via a registered port number instead of relying
            on a Router Alert option. <vspace blankLines="1"/>

          <t hangText="Multicast Query:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>An end node could also discover a LIS by sending a DNS query to
            a well-known address. An example of such a mechanism is multicast DNS (see <xref
              target="RFC4795"/> and <xref target="I-D.cheshire-dnsext-multicastdns"/>).
            Unfortunately, these mechanisms only work on the local link. <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

          <t hangText="Anycast:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/> With this solution an anycast address is defined (for IPv4 and
            IPv6) in the style of <xref target="RFC3068"/> that allows the endhost to route
            discovery packets to the nearest LIS. Note that this procedure would be used purely for
            discovery and thereby similar to local Teredo server discovery approach outlined in
            Section 4.2 of <xref target="I-D.nward-v6ops-teredo-server-selection"/>.</t>

            <vspace blankLines="1"/>The Target's MAC address is known to the end host, but not

          <t hangText="ATM VCI/VPI:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/> The VPI/VCI is generally only seen by the DSL modem. Almost all
            routers in the US use 1 of 2 VPI/VCI value pairs: 0/35 and 8/35. This VC is terminated
            at the DSLAM, which uses a different VPI/VCI (per end customer) to connect to the ATM
            switch. Only the network provider is able to map VPI/VCI values through its network.
            With the arrival of VDSL, ATM will slowly be phased out in favor of Ethernet. <vspace

            <vspace blankLines="1"/>In DSL networks the user credentials are, in many cases, only
            known by the router and not configured at the Target itself. To the network, the authenticated user
            identity is only available if a network access authentication procedure is executed. In
            case of roaming it still might not be available to the access network since security
            protocols might offer user identity confidentiality and thereby hiding the real identity
            of the user allowing the access network to only see a pseudonym or a randomized
              string.<vspace blankLines="1"/>
          </t>
          -->

          <t hangText="Host Identifier:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>The Host Identifier introduced by the Host Identity Protocol
              <xref target="I-D.ietf-hip-base"/> allows identification of a particular host.
            Unfortunately, the network can only use this identifier for location determination if
            the operator already stores an mapping of host identities to location information.
            Furthermore, there is a deployment problem since the host identities are not used in
            todays networks. <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          </t>
          <t hangText="Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA):">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>The concept of a Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) was
            introduced by <xref target="RFC3972"/>. The basic idea is to put the truncated hash of a
            public key into the interface identifier part of an IPv6 address. In addition to the
            properties of an IP address it allows a proof of ownership. Hence, a return routability
            check can be omitted. It is only available for IPv6 addresses.<vspace blankLines="1"/>
          </t>
          <t hangText="Network Access Identifiers:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>A Network Access Identifier <xref target="RFC4282"/> is used
            during the network access authentication procedure, for example in RADIUS <xref
              target="RFC2865"/> and Diameter <xref target="RFC3588"/>. In DSL networks the user
            credentials are, in many cases, only known by the home router and not configured at the
            Target itself. To the network, the authenticated user identity is only available if a
            network access authentication procedure is executed. In case of roaming the user's
            identity might not be available to the access network since security protocols might
            offer user identity confidentiality and thereby hiding the real identity of the user
            allowing the access network to only see a pseudonym or a randomized string.<vspace
              blankLines="1"/>
          </t>
          <t hangText="Unique Client Identifier">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/> The DSL Forum has defined that all devices that expect to be
            managed by the TR-069 interface be able to generate an identifier as described in
            Section 3.4.4 of the TR-069v2 DSL Forum document. It also has a requirement that routers
            that use DHCP to the WAN use RFC 4361 <xref target="RFC4361"/> to provide the DHCP
            server with a unique client identifier. This identifier is, however, not visible to the
            Target when legacy NTE device are used.<vspace blankLines="1"/>
          </t>
          <t hangText="IP Address:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>The Target's IP address may be used for location determination.
            This IP address is not visible to the LIS if the end host is behind one or multiple
            NATs. This may not be a problem since the location of a host that is located behind a
            NAT cannot be determined by the access network. The LIS would in this case only see the
            public IP address of the NAT binding allocated by the NAT, which is the expected
            behavior. The property of the IP address for a return routability check is attractive to
            return location information only to the address that submitted the request. If an
            adversary wants to learn the location of a Target (as identified by a particular IP
            address) then it does not see the response message (unless he is on the subnetwork or at
            a router along the path towards the LIS).<vspace blankLines="1"/> On a shared medium an
            adversary could ask for location information of another Target. The adversary would be
            able to see the response message since it is sniffing on the shared medium unless
            security mechanisms, such as link layer encryption, are in place. With a network
            deployment as shown in <xref target="fixed-wireless"/> with multiple hosts in the
            Customer Premise being behind a NAT the LIS is unable to differentiate the individual
            end points. For WLAN deployments as found in hotels, as shown in <xref target="wireless"
            />, it is possible for an adversary to eavesdrop data traffic and subsequently to spoof
            the IP address in a query to the LIS to learn more detailed location information (e.g.,
            specific room numbers). Such an attack might, for example, compromise the privacy of
            hotel guests. <!-- Note that DHCP would suffer from the same
            problem here unless each node uses link layer security mechanism. -->
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            <!-- Return routability checks are useful only if the adversary does not see the response
            message and if the goal is to delay state establishment. If the adversary is in a
            broadcast network then a return routability check alone is not sufficient to prevent the
            above attack since the adversary will observe the response. -->
