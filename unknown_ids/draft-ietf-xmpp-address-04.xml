  <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
    <t>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol <xref target='XMPP'/> is an application profile of the Extensible Markup Language <xref target="XML"/> for streaming XML data in close to real time between any two or more network-aware entities.  The address format for XMPP entities was originally developed in the Jabber open-source community in 1999, first described by <xref target='XEP-0029'/> in 2002, and defined canonically by <xref target='RFC3920'/> in 2004.</t>
    <t>As specified in RFC 3920, the XMPP address format re-uses the "stringprep" technology for preparation of non-ASCII characters <xref target='STRINGPREP'/>, including the Nameprep profile for internationalized domain names as specified in <xref target='NAMEPREP'/> and <xref target='IDNA2003'/> along with two XMPP-specific profiles for the localpart and resourcepart.  However, since the publication of RFC 3920, IDNA2003 has been superseded by IDNA2008 (see <xref target='IDNA-PROTO'/> and related documents).  As a result, other protocols that use stringprep (including XMPP) have begun to migrate from stringprep toward more "modern" approaches.</t>
    <t>Because work on improved handling of internationalized addresses is currently in progress, specifying the XMPP address format in the specification that obsoletes RFC 3920 would unacceptably delay the revision process.  Therefore, this specification provides updated documentation of the XMPP address format (essentially copied from RFC 3920), with the intent that it can be superseded once work on a new approach to internationalization is complete.</t>

    <section title="Overview" anchor="addressing-overview">
      <t>An XMPP entity is anything that is network-addressable and that can communicate using XMPP.  For historical reasons, the native address of an XMPP entity is called a Jabber Identifier or JID.  A valid JID is a string of <xref target='UNICODE'/> code points, encoded using <xref target='UTF-8'/>, and structured as an ordered sequence of localpart, domainpart, and resourcepart (where the first two parts are demarcated by the '@' character used as a separator, and the last two parts are similarly demarcated by the '/' character).</t>
      <t>The syntax for a JID is defined as follows using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form as specified in <xref target="ABNF"/>.</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
   jid           = [ localpart "@" ] domainpart [ "/" resourcepart ]
   localpart     = 1*(nodepoint)

        ]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>All JIDs are based on the foregoing structure.  One common use of this structure is to identify a messaging and presence account, the server that hosts the account, and a connected resource (e.g., a specific device) in the form of &lt;localpart@domain/resource&gt;.  However, localparts other than clients are possible; for example, a specific chat room offered by a multi-user chat service (see <xref target='XEP-0045'/>) is addressed as &lt;room@service&gt; (where "room" is the name of the chat room and "service" is the hostname of the multi-user chat service) and a specific occupant of such a room could be addressed as &lt;room@service/nick&gt; (where "nick" is the occupant's room nickname).  Many other JID types are possible (e.g., &lt;domain/resource&gt; could be a server-side script or service).</t>
      <t>Each allowable portion of a JID (localpart, domainpart, and resourcepart) MUST NOT be zero bytes in length and MUST NOT be more than 1023 bytes in length, resulting in a maximum total size (including the '@' and '/' separators) of 3071 bytes.</t>
      <t>An entity's address on an XMPP network MUST be represented as a JID (without a URI scheme) and not a <xref target="URI"/> or <xref target="IRI"/> as specified in <xref target="XMPP-URI"/>; the latter specification is provided only for identification and interaction outside the context of XMPP itself.</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Implementation Note: When dividing a JID into its component parts, an implementation needs to match the separator characters '@' and '/' before applying any transformation algorithms, which might decompose certain Unicode code points to the separator characters (e.g., U+FE6B SMALL COMMERCIAL AT might decompose into U+0040 COMMERCIAL AT).</t></list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Domainpart" anchor="addressing-domain">
      <t>The DOMAINPART of a JID is that portion after the '@' character (if any) and before the '/' character (if any); it is the primary identifier and is the only REQUIRED element of a JID (a mere domainpart is a valid JID).  Typically a domainpart identifies the "home" server to which clients connect for XML routing and data management functionality.  However, it is not necessary for an XMPP domainpart to identify an entity that provides core XMPP server functionality (e.g., a domainpart can identify an entity such as a multi-user chat service, a publish-subscribe service, or a user directory).</t>
      <t>The domainpart for every server or service that will communicate over a network SHOULD be a fully qualified domain name or "FQDN" (see <xref target='DNS'/>); although the domainpart is allowed to be either an Internet Protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) address or a text label that is resolvable on a local network (commonly called an "unqualified hostname"), it is possible that domainparts that are IP addresses will not be acceptable to other services for the sake of interdomain communication.  Furthermore, domainparts that are unqualified hostnames MUST NOT be used on public networks but MAY be used on private networks.</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Note: If the domainpart includes a final character considered to be a label separator (dot) by <xref target='IDNA2003'/> or <xref target='DNS'/>, this character MUST be stripped from the domainpart before the JID of which it is a part is used for the purpose of routing an XML stanza, comparing against another JID, or constructing an <xref target='XMPP-URI'/>; in particular, the character MUST be stripped before any other canonicalization steps are taken, such as application of the <xref target='NAMEPREP'/> profile of <xref target='STRINGPREP'/> or completion of the ToASCII operation as described in <xref target='IDNA2003'/>.</t></list></t>
      <t>A domainpart MUST NOT be zero bytes in length and MUST NOT be more than 1023 bytes in length.</t>
      <t>A domainpart consisting of a fully qualified domain name MUST be an "internationalized domain name" as defined in <xref target='IDNA2003'/>, that is, it MUST be "a domain name in which every label is an internationalized label" and MUST follow the rules for construction of internationalized domain names specified in <xref target='IDNA2003'/>.  When preparing a text label (consisting of a sequence of UTF-8 encoded Unicode code points) for representation as an internationalized label in the process of constructing an XMPP domainpart or comparing two XMPP domainparts, an application MUST ensure that for each text label it is possible to apply without failing the ToASCII operation specified in <xref target='IDNA2003'/> with the UseSTD3ASCIIRules flag set (thus forbidding ASCII code points other than letters, digits, and hyphens).  If the ToASCII operation can be applied without failing, then the label is an internationalized label.  (Note: The ToASCII operation includes application of the <xref target='NAMEPREP'/> profile of <xref target='STRINGPREP'/> and encoding using the algorithm specified in <xref target='PUNYCODE'/>; for details, see <xref target='IDNA2003'/>.)  Although XMPP applications do not communicate the output of the ToASCII operation (called an "ACE label") over the wire, it MUST be possible to apply that operation without failing to each internationalized label.  If an XMPP application receives as input an ACE label, it SHOULD convert that ACE label to an internationalized label using the ToUnicode operation (see <xref target='IDNA2003'/>) before including the label in an XMPP domainpart that will be communicated over the wire on an XMPP network (however, instead of converting the label, there are legitimate reasons why an application might instead refuse the input altogether and return an error to the entity that provided the offending data).</t>
      <t>In the terms of IDNA2008 <xref target='IDNA-DEFS'/>, the domainpart of a JID is a "domain name slot".</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Localpart' anchor='addressing-localpart'>
      <t>The LOCALPART of a JID is an optional identifier placed before the domainpart and separated from the latter by the '@' character.  Typically a localpart uniquely identifies the entity requesting and using network access provided by a server (i.e., a local account), although it can also represent other kinds of entities (e.g., a chat room associated with a multi-user chat service).  The entity represented by an XMPP localpart is addressed within the context of a specific domain.</t>
      <t>A localpart MUST NOT be zero bytes in length and MUST NOT be more than 1023 bytes in length.</t>
      <t>A localpart MUST be formatted such that the Nodeprep profile of <xref target="STRINGPREP"/> can be applied without failing (see <xref target="nodeprep"/>).  Before comparing two localparts, an application MUST first ensure that the Nodeprep profile has been applied to each identifier (the profile need not be applied each time a comparison is made, as long as it has been applied before comparison).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Resourcepart" anchor="addressing-resource">
      <t>The resourcepart of a JID is an optional identifier placed after the domainpart and separated from the latter by the '/' character.  A resourcepart can modify either a &lt;localpart@domainpart&gt; address or a mere &lt;domainpart&gt; address.  Typically a resourcepart uniquely identifies a specific connection (e.g., a device or location) or object (e.g., an occupant in a multi-user chat room) belonging to the entity associated with an XMPP localpart at a local domain.</t>
      <t>When an XMPP address does not include a resourcepart (i.e., when it is of the form &lt;domainpart&gt; or &lt;localpart@domainpart&gt;), it is referred to as a BARE JID.  When an XMPP address includes a resourcepart (i.e., when it is of the form &lt;domain/resource&gt; or &lt;localpart@domain/resource&gt;), is referred to as a FULL JID.</t>
      <t>A resourcepart MUST NOT be zero bytes in length and MUST NOT be more than 1023 bytes in length.</t>
      <t>A resourcepart MUST be formatted such that the Resourceprep profile of <xref target="STRINGPREP"/> can be applied without failing (see <xref target="resourceprep"/>).  Before comparing two resourceparts, an application MUST first ensure that the Resourceprep profile has been applied to each identifier (the profile need not be applied each time a comparison is made, as long as it has been applied before comparison).</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Note: For historical reasons, the term "resource identifier" is often used in XMPP to refer to the optional portion of an XMPP address that follows the domainpart and the "/" separator character; to help prevent confusion between an XMPP "resource identifier" and the meanings of "resource" and "identifier" provided in Section 1.1 of <xref target="URI"/>, this specification uses the term "resourcepart" instead of "resource identifier" (as in RFC 3920).</t></list></t>
      <t>XMPP entities SHOULD consider resourceparts to be opaque strings and SHOULD NOT impute meaning to any given resourcepart.  In particular:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>Use of the '/' character as a separator between the domainpart and the resourcepart does not imply that XMPP addresses are hierarchical in the way that, say, HTTP addresses are hierarchical; thus for example an XMPP address of the form &lt;localpart@domain/foo/bar&gt; does not identify a resource "bar" that exists below a resource "foo" in a hierarchy of resources associated with the entity "localpart@domain".<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>The '@' character is allowed in the resourcepart, and is often used in the "nick" shown in XMPP chatrooms.  For example, the JID &lt;room@chat.example.com/user@host&gt; describes an entity who is an occupant of the room &lt;room@chat.example.com&gt; with an (asserted) nick of &lt;user@host&gt;.  However, chatroom services do not necessarily check such an asserted nick against the occupant's real JID.</t>

  <section title="Internationalization Considerations" anchor="i18n">
    <t>XMPP servers MUST, and XMPP clients SHOULD, support <xref target="IDNA2003"/> for domainparts (including the <xref target="NAMEPREP"/> profile of <xref target="STRINGPREP"/>), the <xref target='nodeprep'>Nodeprep</xref> profile of <xref target="STRINGPREP"/> for localparts, and the <xref target='resourceprep'>Resourceprep</xref> profile of <xref target="STRINGPREP"/> for resourceparts; this enables XMPP addresses to include a wide variety of characters outside the US-ASCII range.  Rules for enforcement of the XMPP address format are provided in <xref target='XMPP'/>.</t>

  <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
    <section title="Reuse of Stringprep" anchor="security-stringprep">
      <t>The security considerations described in <xref target="STRINGPREP"/> apply to the <xref target="nodeprep">Nodeprep</xref> and <xref target="resourceprep">Resourceprep</xref> profiles defined in this document for XMPP localparts and resourceparts.  The security considerations described in <xref target="STRINGPREP"/> and <xref target="NAMEPREP"/> apply to the Nameprep profile that is re-used here for XMPP domainparts.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Reuse of Unicode" anchor="security-unicode">
      <t>The security considerations described in <xref target='UNICODE-SEC'/> apply to the use of Unicode characters in XMPP addresses.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Confusable Characters" anchor="security-confusables">
      <t>The Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 repertoires have many characters that look similar (so-called "confusable characters").  In many cases, users of security protocols might perform visual matching, such as when comparing the names of trusted third parties.  Because it is impossible to map similar-looking characters without a great deal of context (such as knowing the fonts used), stringprep does nothing to map similar-looking characters together, nor to prohibit some characters because they look like others.  Some specific suggestions about identification and handling of confusable characters appear in the Unicode Security Considerations <xref target='UNICODE-SEC'/>.</t>
      <t>A localpart can be employed as one part of an entity's address in XMPP.  One common usage is as the username of an instant messaging user; another is as the name of a multi-user chat room; and many other kinds of entities could use localparts as part of their addresses.  The security of such services could be compromised based on different interpretations of the internationalized localpart; for example, a user entering a single internationalized localpart could access another user's account information, or a user could gain access to a hidden or otherwise restricted chat room or service.</t>
      <t>A resourcepart can be employed as one part of an entity's address in XMPP.  One common usage is as the name for an instant messaging user's connected resource; another is as the nickname of a user in a multi-user chat room; and many other kinds of entities could use resourceparts as part of their addresses.  The security of such services could be compromised based on different interpretations of the internationalized resourcepart; for example, a user could attempt to initiate multiple connections with the same name, or a user could send a message to someone other than the intended recipient in a multi-user chat room.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Address Spoofing" anchor="security-spoofing">
      <t>There are two forms of address spoofing: forging and mimicking.</t>
      <section title="Address Forging" anchor="security-forging">
        <t>In the context of XMPP technologies, address forging occurs when an entity is able to generate an XML stanza whose 'from' address does not correspond to the account credentials with which the entity authenticated onto the network (or an authorization identity provided during SASL negotiation).  For example, address forging occurs if an entity that authenticated as "juliet@im.example.com" is able to send XML stanzas from "nurse@im.example.com" or "romeo@example.net".</t>
        <t>Address forging is difficult in XMPP systems, given the requirement for sending servers to stamp 'from' addresses and for receiving servers to verify sending domains via server-to-server authentication (see <xref target='XMPP'/>).  However, address forging is not impossible, since a rogue server could forge JIDs at the sending domain by ignoring the stamping requirement.  Therefore, an entity outside the security perimeter of a particular server cannot reliably distinguish between bare JIDs of the form &lt;localpart@domainpart&gt; at that server and thus can authenticate only the domainpart of such JIDs with any level of assurance.  This specification does not define methods for discovering or counteracting such rogue servers.</t>
        <t>Furthermore, it is possible for an attacker to forge JIDs at other domains by means of a DNS poisoning attack if DNS security extensions <xref target='DNSSEC'/> are not used.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Address Mimicking" anchor="security-mimicking">
        <t>Address mimicking occurs when an entity provides legitimate authentication credentials for and sends XML stanzas from an account whose JID appears to a human user to be the same as another JID.  For example, in some XMPP clients the address "paypa1@example.org" (spelled with the number one as the final character of the localpart) might appear to be the same as "paypal@example.org (spelled with the lower-case version of the letter "L"), especially on casual visual inspection; this phenomenon is sometimes called "typejacking".  A more sophisticated example of address mimicking might involve the use of characters from outside the US-ASCII range, such as the Cherokee characters U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2 instead of the US-ASCII characters "STPETER".</t>
        <t>In some examples of address mimicking, it is unlikely that the average user could tell the difference between the real JID and the fake JID.  (Indeed, there is no way to distinguish with full certainty which is the fake JID and which is the real JID; in some communication contexts, the JID with Cherokee characters might be the real JID and the JID with US-ASCII characters might thus appear to be the fake JID.)  Because JIDs can contain almost any Unicode character, it can be relatively easy to mimic some JIDs in XMPP systems.  The possibility of address mimicking introduces security vulnerabilities of the kind that have also plagued the World Wide Web, specifically the phenomenon known as phishing.</t>
        <t>As noted in <xref target='IDNA-DEFS'/>, "there are no comprehensive technical solutions to the problems of confusable characters".  Mimicked JIDs that involve characters from only one character set or from the character set typically employed by a particular user are not easy to combat (e.g., the simple typejacking attack previously described, which relies on a surface similarity between the characters "1" and "l" in some presentations).  However, mimicked addresses that involve characters from more than one character set, or from a character set not typically employed by a particular user, can be mitigated somewhat through intelligent presentation.  In particular, every human user of an XMPP technology presumably has a preferred language (or, in some cases, a small set of preferred languages), which an XMPP application SHOULD gather either explicitly from the user or implicitly via the operating system of the user's device.  Furthermore, every language has a range (or a small set of ranges) of characters normally used to represent that language in textual form.  Therefore, an XMPP application SHOULD warn the user when presenting a JID that mixes characters from more than one character set or that uses characters outside the normal range of the user's preferred language(s).  This recommendation is not intended to discourage communication across language communities; instead, it recognizes the existence of such language communities and encourages due caution when presenting unfamiliar character sets to human users.</t>

<abstract>
<t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list>
<t>
      The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL
      NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;,  &quot;MAY&quot;, and
      &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.

The framework includes methods for stream setup and teardown, channel encryption, authentication of a client to a server and of one server to another server, and primitives for push-style messages, publication of network availability information ("presence"), and request-response interactions between any two XMPP entities.

<t>&lt;p>This document defines a new protocol element, the Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI), as a complement of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). An IRI is a sequence of characters from the Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646). A mapping from IRIs to URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used instead of URIs, where appropriate, to identify resources.&lt;/p>&lt;p> The approach of defining a new protocol element was chosen instead of extending or changing the definition of URIs. This was done in order to allow a clear distinction and to avoid incompatibilities with existing software. Guidelines are provided for the use and deployment of IRIs in various protocols, formats, and software components that currently deal with URIs.&lt;/p></t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>Punycode is a simple and efficient transfer encoding syntax designed for use with Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA). It uniquely and reversibly transforms a Unicode string into an ASCII string. ASCII characters in the Unicode string are represented literally, and non-ASCII characters are represented by ASCII characters that are allowed in host name labels (letters, digits, and hyphens). This document defines a general algorithm called Bootstring that allows a string of basic code points to uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a larger set. Punycode is an instance of Bootstring that uses particular parameter values specified by this document, appropriate for IDNA. [STANDARDS TRACK] </t></abstract></front>

<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

        <t>This appendix defines the "Nodeprep" profile of stringprep.  As such, it specifies processing rules that will enable users to enter internationalized localparts in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) and have the highest chance of getting the content of the strings correct.  (An XMPP localpart is the optional portion of an XMPP address that precedes an XMPP domainpart and the '@' separator; it is often but not exclusively associated with an instant messaging username.)  These processing rules are intended only for XMPP localparts and are not intended for arbitrary text or any other aspect of an XMPP address.</t>

          <t>The mappings used: specified in Section 3</t>

          <t>To avoid confusion with the terms "resource" and "identifier" as used in <xref target="URI"/>, changed the term "resource identifier" to "resourcepart".</t>
