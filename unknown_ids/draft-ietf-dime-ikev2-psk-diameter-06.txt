Diameter IKEv2 PSK: Pre-Shared Secret-based Support for IKEv2 Server to
                      Diameter Server Interaction
               draft-ietf-dime-ikev2-psk-diameter-06.txt

Abstract

   The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) is a component
   of the IPsec architecture and is used to perform mutual
   authentication as well as to establish and to maintain IPsec security
   associations (SAs) between the respective parties.  IKEv2 supports
   several different authentication mechanisms, such as the Extensible
   Authentication Protocol (EAP), certificates, and pre-shared secrets.

   With [RFC5778] the Diameter interworking for Mobile IPv6 between the
   Home Agent, as a Diameter client, and the Diameter server has been
   specified.  However, that specification focused on the usage of EAP
   and did not include support for pre-shared secret based
   authentication available with IKEv2.  This document specifies IKEv2
   server, as a Diameter client, to the Diameter server communication
   for IKEv2 with pre-shared secret based authentication.

Internet-Draft             Diameter IKEv2 PSK                   May 2011


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4306] defines the version 2 of Internet Key Exchange (IKE) as a
   protocol that performs mutual authentication between two parties and
   establishes a security association (SA) that includes shared secret
   information that can be used to efficiently establish SAs for
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] and/or Authentication
   Header (AH) [RFC4302], and a set of cryptographic algorithms to be
   used by the SAs to protect the traffic that they carry.  The IKEv2
   protocol allows several different mechanisms for authenticating a
   IKEv2 Peer to be used, such as the Extensible Authentication
   Protocol, certificates, and pre-shared secrets.

   From a service provider perspective, it is important to ensure that a
   user is authorized to use the services.  Therefore, the IKEv2 Server
   must verify that the IKEv2 Peer is authorized for the requested
   services possibly with the assistance of the operator's Diameter
   servers.  [RFC5778] defines the home agent as a Diameter client to
   the Diameter server communication when the mobile node authenticates
   using the IKEv2 protocol with the Extensible Authentication Protocol
   (EAP) [RFC3748] or using the Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol
   [RFC4285].  This document specifies IKEv2 server, as a Diameter
   client, to the Diameter server communication for IKEv2 with pre-
   shared secret based authentication.

   This document does not assume that the IKEv2 Server has the pre-
   shared secrets (PSK) with the IKEv2 Peer.  Instead, it allows for PSK
   to be derived for a specific IKEv2 session and exchanged between
   IKEv2 Server and Home Authentication, Authorization and Accounting
   (HAAA) server.  This is accomplished through the use of a new
   Diameter application specifically designed for performing IKEv2
   authorization decisions.

   This specification defines a new Diameter application and its
   respective Application Identifier:

      Diameter IKE PSK  (IKEPSK)  TBD1 by IANA


   The IKEPSK Application Identifier is used when the IKEv2 Peer is to
   be authenticated and authorized using IKEv2 with PSK-based
   authentication.

4.  Protocol Description

4.1.  Support for IKEv2 and Pre-Shared Secrets

   When IKEv2 is used with PSK-based initiator authentication, the
   Diameter commands IKEv2-PSK-Request/Answer defined in this document
   are used between IKEv2 server and a Home AAA server (HAAA) to
   authorize the IKEv2 Peer for the services.  Upon receiving the
   IKE_AUTH message from the IKEv2 Peer, the IKEv2 Server uses the
   information received in IDi and the SPI if available, to determine if
   it has the PSK for this IKEv2 Peer.  If there is no PSK found
   associated with this IKEv2 Peer, the IKEv2 Server MUST send an
   Authorize-Only (Auth-Request-Type set to "Authorize-Only") Diameter
   IKEv2-PSK message with the IKEv2 Peer's IDi payload and SPI if
   available to the HAAA to obtain the PSK.  The IDi payload extracted
   from the IKE_AUTH message MUST contain an identity that is meaningful
   for the Diameter infrastructure, such as a Network Access Identifier
   (NAI), since it is used by the IKEv2 Server to populate the User-Name
   AVP in the Diameter message.  The IKEv2 Server also includes in the
   IKEv2-Nonces AVP of the same Diameter message the initiator and
   responder nonces (Ni and Nr) exchanged during initial IKEv2 exchange.

   The IKEv2-PSK-Request message is routed to the IKEv2 Peer's HAAA.
   Upon receiving Diameter IKEv2-PSK-Request message from the IKEv2
   Server, the HAAA SHALL use the User-Name AVP and the Key-SPI AVP if
   included to retrieve the associated keying material.  The HAAA SHALL
   use the nonces Ni and Nr received in IKEv2-Nonces AVP to generate the
   PSK.  The HAAA returns the PSK to the IKEv2 Server using the Key AVP
   as specified in [I-D.ietf-dime-local-keytran].  It is outside of
   scope of this document how the HAAA obtains or generates the PSK.
   For example, if the HAAA previously performed EAP based access
   authentication and authorization of the IKEv2 Peer, it can use the
   available EMSK to generate the PSK [RFC5295].

   Once the IKEv2 Server receives the PSK from the HAAA, the IKEv2
   Server verifies the IKE_AUTH message received from the IKEv2 Peer.
   If the verification of AUTH is successful, the IKEv2 Server sends the
   IKE message back to the IKEv2 Peer.

4.2.  Session Management

   The HAAA may maintain state or may be stateless.  This is indicated
   by presence or absence of the Auth-Session-State AVP.  The IKEv2
   Server MUST support the Authorization Session State Machine defined
   in [RFC3588].

   This specification makes an assumption that each IKE_SA created
   between the IKEv2 Peer and the IKEv2 Server as a result of a

   successful IKEv2 negotiation exchange together with CHILD_SAs set up
   through that particular IKE_SA corresponds to one currently active
   PSK and one active Diameter session.

4.2.1.  Session-Termination-Request/Answer

   In the case where HAAA is maintaining session state, when the IKEv2
   Server terminates the SA it SHALL send a Session-Termination-Request
   (STR) message [RFC3588] to inform the HAAA that the authorized
   session has been terminated.

   The Session-Termination-Answer (STA) message [RFC3588] is sent by the
   HAAA to acknowledge the notification that the session has been
   terminated.

4.2.2.  Abort-Session-Request/Answer

   The Abort-Session-Request (ASR) message [RFC3588] is sent by the HAAA
   to the IKEv2 Server to terminate the authorized session.  When the
   IKEv2 Server receives the ASR message, it MUST delete the
   corresponding IKE_SA and all CHILD_SAs set up through it.

   The Abort-Session-Answer (ASA) message [RFC3588] is sent by the IKEv2
   Server in response to an ASR message.

8.  AVP Flag Rules

   The following table describes the Diameter AVPs, their AVP Code
   values, types, possible flag values, and whether the AVP MAY be
   encrypted.  The Diameter base [RFC3588] specifies the AVP Flag rules
   for AVPs in Section 4.5.


                                               +--------------------+

9.  IANA Considerations

   Upon publication of this memo as an RFC, IANA is requested to assign
   values as described in the following sections.

9.1.  Command Codes

   IANA is requested to allocate a command code value for the the
   following new command from the Command Code namespace defined in
   [RFC3588].

      Command Code                     | Value
      ---------------------------------+------
      IKEv2-PSK-Request/Answer         | TBD2



9.2.  AVP Codes

   This specification requires IANA to register the following new AVPs
   from the AVP Code namespace defined in [RFC3588].


   o  IKEv2-Nonces - TBD4

   o  Ni - TBD5

   o  Nr - TBD6


   The AVPs are defined in Section 6.

9.3.  AVP Values

   IANA is requested to create a new value for the Key-Type AVP.  The
   new value TBD3 signifies that IKEv2 PSK is being sent.

9.4.  Application Identifier

   This specification requires IANA to allocate one new value "Diameter
   IKE PSK" from the Application Identifier namespace defined in
   [RFC3588].

   Application Identifier         | Value
   -------------------------------+------
   Diameter IKE PSK (IKEPSK)      | TBD1

10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the Diameter Base protocol [RFC3588]
   are applicable to this document.

   The Diameter messages between the IKEv2 Server and the HAAA may be
   transported via one or more AAA brokers or Diameter agents.  In this
   case, the IKEv2 Server to the Diameter server AAA communication
   relies on the security properties of the intermediating AAA inter-
   connection networks, AAA brokers, and Diameter agents.  Furthermore,
   any agents that process IKEv2-PSK-Answer messages can see the
   contents of the Key AVP.  For this reason, this specification
   strongly recommends avoiding Diameter agents when they cannot be
   trusted to keep the keys secret.

   This specification expects that the HAAA derives and returns the
   associated session key to the IKEv2 Server.  For the key derivation
   this specification recommends the use of short lived secrets,
   possibly based on a previous network access authentication run, if
   such secrets are available.  To ensure key freshness, limit the key
   scope etc., this specification also recommends the use of nonces, if
   nonces are included in IKEv2-PSK-Request.  However, this
   specification does not define how the Diameter server actually
   derives required keys.  The details of the key derivation depends on
   the deployment where this specification is used and therefore the
   security properties of the system depend on how this is done.
