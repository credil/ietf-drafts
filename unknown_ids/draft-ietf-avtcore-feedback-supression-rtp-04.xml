    <abstract>
      <t>In a large RTP session using the RTCP feedback mechanism defined in
      RFC 4585, a feedback target may experience transient overload if some
      event causes a large number of receivers to send feedback at once. This
      overload is usually avoided by ensuring that feedback reports are
      forwarded to all receivers, allowing them to avoid sending duplicate
      feedback reports. However, there are certain cases where it is not
      possible to forward feedback reports, and this may allow feedback
      implosion. This memo defines a new RTCP third-party loss report that can
      be used to inform receivers that a feedback target is aware of some loss
      event, allowing them to suppress feedback. Associated SDP signalling is
      also defined.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>RTCP feedback messages <xref target="RFC4585"></xref> allow the
      receivers in an RTP session to report events and ask for action from the
      media source (or a delegated feedback target defined in SSM <xref
      target="RFC5760"></xref>). There are cases where multiple receivers may
      initiate the same, or an equivalent message towards the same media
      source. When the receiver count is large, this behavior may cause
      transient overload of the media source, the network or both. This is
      known as a "feedback storm" or a "NACK storm". One common cause of such
      a feedback storm is receivers utilizing RTP retransmission <xref
      target="RFC4588"></xref> as a packet loss recovery technique based,
      sending feedback using RTCP NACK messages <xref target="RFC4585"></xref>
      without proper dithering of the retransmission requests.</t>

      <t>Another use case involves video Fast Update requests. A storm of
      these feedback messages can occur in conversational multimedia scenarios
      like Topo-Video-switch-MCU <xref target="RFC5117"></xref>. In this
      scenario, packet loss may happen on an upstream link of an intermediate
      network element such as a Multipoint Control Unit(MCU). Poorly designed
      receivers that blindly issue fast update requests (i.e., Full Intra
      Request (FIR) described in <xref target="RFC5104"></xref>), can cause an
      implosion of FIR requests from receivers to the same media source.</t>

      <t>RTCP feedback storms may cause short term overload, and in extreme
      cases to pose a possible risk of increasing network congestion on the
      control channel (e.g. RTCP feedback), the data channel, or both. It is
      therefore desirable to provide a way of suppressing unneeded
      feedback.</t>

      <t>One approach to this, suggested in <xref target="DVB-IPTV"></xref>,
      involves sending a NACK message to the other clients (or receiver) in
      the same group as the sender of NACK. However sending multicast NACK to
      the group can not prevent large amount of unicast NACK addressed to the
      same media source or middlebox, for example when the NACK is used as a
      retransmission request <xref target="RFC4588"></xref>. Also NACK is
      defined as a receiver report sent from a receiver observing a packet
      loss, therefore it only inform others that sender of NACK detected loss
      while the case the sender of the feedback has received reports that the
      indicated packets were lost is not covered. This document specifies a
      new message for this function. It further is more precise in the
      intended uses and less likely to be confusing to receivers. It tells
      receivers explicitly that feedback for a particular packet or frame loss
      is not needed for a period of time and can provide an early indication
      before the receiver reacts to the loss and invokes its packet loss
      repair machinery.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol Overview">
      <t>This document extends the RTCP feedback messages defined in the
      Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF) and define the Third Party
      Loss Report message. The Third Party Loss Report message informs the
      receiver in the downstream path of the middlebox that the sender of the
      Third Party Loss Report has received reports that the indicated packets
      were lost and asks a receiver to not send feedback messages for
      particular packets (indicated by their RTP sequence numbers) independent
      of whether the receiver detected the packet loss or detected a need for
      a decoder refresh point.</t>

      <t>In order to observe packet loss before the receivers perceive it, one
      or more intermediate nodes may be placed between the media source and
      the receivers. These intermediates are variously referred to as
      Distribution servers, MCUs, RTP translator, or RTP mixers, depending on
      the precise use case. These intermediaries monitor for packet loss
      upstream of themselves by checking RTP sequence numbers, just as
      receivers do. If an intermediary notices the loss itself, then it may
      send a NACK both downstream towards the receivers and upstream towards
      the media source, to indicate that it has noticed the loss, and to
      suppress feedback from other downstream receivers. If an intermediary
      receives a NACK from another system, it should redistribute that NACK to
      all other systems that would not otherwise receive it. An example of
      this is RTCP-SSM in simple feedback model <xref
      target="RFC5760"></xref>, where the distribution source reflects NACKs
      to other systems. If an intermediary receives a NACK from another
      system, but, for some reason, cannot redistribute that NACK, then it may
      send a third-party loss report to the systems that were unable to
      receive the NACK, and won't receive the NACK via other means. An example
      would be a distribution source using RTCP-SSM in Distribution Source
      Feedback Summary model <xref target="RFC5760"></xref>. Therefore the
      intermediate node can be reasonably certain that it will help the
      situation by sending a Third Party Loss Report message to all the
      relevant receivers, thereby indicating to the receivers that they should
      not transmit feedback messages for a period of time. The intermediate
      node needs to take into account such factors as the tolerable
      application delay, packet loss recovery techniques, the network
      dynamics, and the media type. Loss-repair methods such as retransmission
      and Forward Error Correction may be used to recover the missing
      packet.</t>

      <t>Alternatively, the media source may directly monitor the amount of
      feedback reports it receives from downstream. If the media source
      receives a NACK from another system, it should redistribute that NACK to
      all other systems that would not otherwise receive it. An example of
      this is RTCP-SSM in simple feedback model <xref
      target="RFC5760"></xref>, where the distribution source reflects NACKs
      to other systems. If an intermediary receives a NACK from another
      system, but, for some reason, cannot redistribute that NACK, then it may
      send a third-party loss report to the systems that were unable to
      receive the NACK, and won't receive the NACK via other means. An example
      would be a distribution source using RTCP-SSM in Distribution Source
      Feedback Summary model <xref target="RFC5760"></xref>. </t>

      <t>When a receiver gets such a Third Party Loss Report message, it
      should refrain from sending a feedback request (e.g., NACK or FIR) for
      the missing packets reported in the message for a period of time. A
      receiver may still have sent a Feedback message according to the AVPF
      scheduling algorithm of <xref target="RFC4585"></xref>before receiving a
      Third Party Loss Report message, but further feedback messages for those
      sequence numbers will be suppressed by this technique for a period of
      time. Nodes that do not understand the Third Party Loss Report message
      will ignore it, and might therefore still send feedback according to the
      AVPF scheduling algorithm of <xref target="RFC4585"></xref>. The media
      source or intermediate nodes cannot assume that the use of a Third Party
      Loss Report message actually reduces the amount of feedback it
      receives.</t>

      <t>RTCP Third Party Loss Report follows the similar format of message
      type as RTCP NACK. But unlike RTCP NACK, the third party loss report is
      defined as an indication that the sender of the feedback has received
      reports that the indicated packets were lost and conveys the packet
      receipt/loss events at the sequence number level from the middlebox to
      the receivers in the downstream path of middlebox while NACK <xref
      target="RFC4585"></xref> just indicates that the sender of the NACK
      observed that these packets were lost. The Third Party Loss Report
      message is generated by RTP middlebox that has not seen the actual
      packet loss and sent to the corresponding receivers. Intermediaries
      downstream of an intermediary receiving the upstream report obviously
      SHOULD NOT initiate their own additional Third Party Loss Report
      messages for the same packet sequence numbers. They may either simply
      forward the Third Party Loss Report message received from upstream, or
      send its own Third Party Loss Report message that reflects the loss they
      have been told. The Third Party Loss Report does not have the
      retransmission request <xref target="RFC4588"></xref> semantics.</t>

      <t>Since Third Party Loss Report interacts strongly with repair timing,
      it has to work together with feedback to not adversely impact the repair
      of lost source packets. One example is the middle box gets the
      retransmitted packet by sending a NACK upstream and sent it downstream.
      This retransmitted packet was lost on the downstream link. In order to
      deal with this, the downstream receiver can start a timeout in which it
      expected to get a retransmission packet. When this timeout expires and
      there is no retransmitted packet or a new third party loss report
      message, it can take its normal behavior as if there is no current
      retransmission suppression. In some cases where the loss was detected
      and repair initiated much closer to the source, the delay for the
      receiver to recover from packet loss can be reduced through the
      combination of intermediary feedback to the source and Third Party Loss
      Report downstream. In all (properly operating) cases, the risk of
      increasing network congestion is decreased.</t>

    <section anchor="sec4" title="Format of RTCP Feedback Messages">
      <t>This document registers two new RTCP Feedback messages for Third
      Party Loss Report. Applications that are employing one or more
      loss-repair methods MAY use Third Party Loss Report together with their
      existing loss-repair methods either for every packet they expect to
      receive, or for an application-specific subset of the RTP packets in a
      session. In other words, receivers MAY ignore Third Party Loss Report
      messages, but SHOULD react to them unless they have good reason to still
      send feedback messages despite having been requested to suppress
      them.</t>

    <section title="Example Use Cases">
      <t>The operation of feedback suppression is similar for all types of RTP
      sessions and topologies <xref target="RFC5117"></xref>, however the
      exact messages used and the scenarios in which suppression is employed
      differ for various use cases. The following sections outline the
      intended use cases of using Third Party Loss Report for feedback
      suppression and give an overview of the particular mechanisms.</t>

      <section title="Source Specific Multicast (SSM) use case">
        <t>In SSM RTP sessions as described in <xref target="RFC5760"></xref>,
        one or more Media Sources send RTP packets to a Distribution Source.
        The Distribution Source relays the RTP packets to the receivers using
        a source-specific multicast group.</t>

        <t>As outlined in the [RFC5760], there are two Unicast Feedback models
        that may be used for reporting, - the Simple Feedback model and the
        Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model. In the simple Feedback
        Model, NACKs are reflected by the distribution source to the other
        receivers, and there's no need for distribution source to create the
        third-party loss report. The third-party loss report is only generated
        at the distribution source when downstream loss report is received in
        Distribution Source Feedback Summary model. Therefore the RTCP
        extension for Third Party Loss Report specified in the Section 4 of
        this document only works in Distribution Source Feedback models.
        Details of operation are specified in <xref
        target="SummaryModel"></xref>.</t>

        <t>In order to avoid the forms of Feedback implosion described in
        section 1,the distribution source should be told that the indicated
        packets were lost. When one downstream receiver reports loss, the
        distribution source creates a Third Party Loss Report and sent it to
        all the other RTP receivers which are not aware of feedback report,
        over the multicast channel. Another possibility is when there may be
        multiple distribution sources placed between the media source and the
        receivers, each distribution source may send its own Third Party Loss
        report to downstream receivers respectively when downstream loss is
        reported to each distribution source. And also the upstream
        distribution source may inform downstream distribution sources in the
        path of the detected packet loss using the Third Party Loss Report
        messages. In response, if the upstream Third Party Loss Report reports
        the different event, the downstream distribution sources forward Third
        Party Loss Report received from upstream to all the RTP receivers,
        over the multicast channel. If the same event is reported both from
        upstream distribution source and from the downstream receiver, the
        downstream distribution source may suppress creating and sending its
        own report to the relevant RTP receivers. This Third Party Loss Report
        message tells the receivers that the sender of the third party loss
        report has received reports that the indicated packets were lost. The
        distribution source then can (optionally) ask for the lost packets
        from the media source or itself on behalf of all the RTP receivers.
        The lost packets will either be forthcoming from distribution source,
        or it irretrievably lost such that there is nothing to be gained by
        the receiver sending a NACK to the media source.</t>

        <t>The distribution source must be able to communicate with all group
        members in order for either mechanism to be effective at suppressing
        feedback. If the media source(s) are part of the SSM group for RTCP
        packet, the Distribution Source must filter this packet out. If the
        media source(s) are not part of the SSM group for RTCP packets, the
        Distribution Source must not forward this RTCP Third Party Loss Report
        message to the media source(s).</t>

        <section anchor="SummaryModel"
                 title="Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model">
          <t>In the distribution source feedback summary model, we assume
          there are two distribution sources between media source and
          receivers: distribution source A and distribution source B. The
          distribution source A is at the upstream of distribution source
          B.</t>

          <t>The distribution source A must listen on the RTP channel for
          data. When the distribution source A observes RTP packets from a
          media source are not consecutive by checking the sequence number of
          packets, the distribution source A generates the NACK message, and
          then send it to receivers in the downstream path via the multicast
          channel. Also the distribution source A may create a Third Party
          Loss Report and send it to all the other RTP receivers which are not
          aware of feedback report, over the multicast channel when downstream
          loss is reported to distribution source A. </t>

          <t>The Distribution Source B must also listen for RTCP data sent to
          the RTCP port. Upon receiving the RTCP Third Party Loss Report or
          NACK message from the Distribution Source A, the Distribution Source
          B needs to check whether it sees the same event reported both from
          upstream distribution source A and downstream receiver. If the
          upstream Third Party Loss Report reports the different event, the
          distribution source B passes through any Third Party Loss Report
          message it receives from the upstream direction. If the same event
          is reported from both distribution source A and downstream receiver
          of distribution source B, the distribution source B may suppress
          creating and sending its own report with the same event to the
          downstream RTP receiver.</t>

          <t>Also the Distribution Source B may create and send its own Third
          Party Loss Report described in the Section 4 to the group over the
          multicast RTCP channel in response to NACKs received from
          downstream. if downstream loss is reported using NACK to the
          distribution source B.</t>

      <section title="Unicast based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast Stream (RAMS) use case">
        <t>The typical RAMS architecture <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp"></xref> may have
        several Burst/Retransmission Sources(BRS) behind the multicast source
        (MS) These BRSes will receive the multicast SSM stream from the media
        source. If one of the BRSes receives downstream loss report (i.e.,
        First loss in <xref target="fig4"></xref>) on its downstream link, but
        the others BRSes have not, as the packet loss took place on the SSM
        tree branch that does not impact the other BRSes. In such case, the
        BRSes not being impacted are not aware of downstream loss at their
        downstream link, therefore these BRSes will not create new Third Party
        Loss Report message and send it to receivers in their downstream path.
        If the BRS impacted by packet loss has been told the actual packet
        loss, the BRS MAY choose to create new Third Party Loss Report message
        and send it to the receivers in the downstream link. Note that BRS
        must use its own SSRC as packet sender SSRC for transmitting the
        feedback suppress message.</t>

        <t>The BRS may also send a NACK upstream to request the retransmitted
        packet. Upon receiving the retransmitted packet, the BRS sent it
        downstream. Note that this retransmitted packet may get lost (i.e.,
        second loss in the <xref target="fig4"></xref>) on the downstream
        link. In order to deal with this issue, the downstream receiver can
        start a timeout clock in which it expected to get a retransmission
        packet. When this timeout expires and there is no retransmitted packet
        or a new Third Party Loss Report message, it can take its normal
        behavior as if there is no current retransmission suppression in
        place. <figure align="center" anchor="fig4" title="RAMS Use Case">

      <section title="RTP transport translator use case">
        <t>A Transport Translator (Topo-Trn-Translator), as defined in <xref
        target="RFC5117"></xref> is typically forwarding the RTP and RTCP
        traffic between RTP clients, for example converting between multicast
        and unicast for domains that do not support multicast. The translator
        can identify packet loss from the upstream and send the Third Party
        Loss Report message to the unicast receivers. Note that the translator
        must be a participant in the session and can then use it's own SSRC as
        packet sender SSRC for transmitting the Third Party Loss Report
        message</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) use case">
        <t>In point to multipoint topologies using video switching MCU
        (Topo-Video-switch-MCU) <xref target="RFC5117"></xref>, the MCU
        typically forwards a single media stream to each participant, selected
        from the available input streams. The selection of the input stream is
        often based on voice activity in the audio-visual conference, but
        other conference management mechanisms (like presentation mode or
        explicit floor control) exist as well.</t>

        <t>In this case the MCU may detect packet loss from the sender or may
        decide to switch to a new source. In both cases the receiver may lose
        synchronization with the video stream and may send a FIR request. If
        the MCU itself can detect the mis-synchronization of the video, the
        MCU can send the FIR suppression message to the receivers and send a
        FIR request to the video source. As suggested in RFC 5117, this
        topology is better implemented as an Topo-mixer, in which case the
        mixer's SSRC is used as packet sender SSRC for transmitting Third
        Party Loss Report message.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The defined messages have certain properties that have security
      implications. These must be addressed and taken into account by users of
      this protocol.</t>

      <t>Spoofed or maliciously created feedback messages of the type defined
      in this specification can have the following implications:</t>

      <t>Sending Third Party Loss Report with wrong sequence number of lost
      packet that makes missing RTP packets can not be compensated.</t>

      <t>To prevent these attacks, there is a need to apply authentication and
      integrity protection of the feedback messages. This can be accomplished
      against threats external to the current RTP session using the RTP
      profile that combines Secure RTP <xref target="RFC3711"></xref> and AVPF
      into SAVPF <xref target="RFC5124"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Note that middleboxes that are not visible at the RTP layer that wish
      to send Third Party Loss Reports on behalf of the media source can only
      do so if they spoof the SSRC of the media source. This is difficult in
      case SRTP is in use. If the middlebox is visible at the RTP layer, this
      is not an issue, provided the middlebox is part of the security context
      for the session.</t>

      <t>Also note that endpoints that receive a Third Party Loss Report would
      be well-advised to ignore it, unless it is authenticated via SRTCP or
      similar. Accepting un-authenticated Third Party Loss Report can lead to
      a denial of service attack, where the endpoint accepts poor quality
      media that could be repaired.</t>
