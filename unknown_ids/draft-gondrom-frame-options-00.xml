      <t>To improve the protection of web applications against Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
      and Clickjacking this standards defines a http response header that declares a policy 
      communicated from a host to the client browser whether the transmitted content MUST NOT be displayed in frames of other 
      pages from different origins or a list of trusted origins which are allowed to frame the content. 
      </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In 2009 and 2010 many browser vendors introduced the use of a non-standard http header <xref target="RFC2616">RFC 2616</xref>
      "X-Frame-Options" to protect against <xref target="Clickjacking">Clickjacking</xref>
      and Cross Site Request Forgery <xref target="CSRF">(CSRF)</xref>. This standard is to replace the non-standard header.</t>
      
      <t>With Clickjacking and CSRF an attacker tricks a user into clicking on a button 
      or link to another page and by thus executing an unintended command in the 
      context of a different web application. For example with Clickjacking the attacker 
      might use transparent or opaque layers to integrate and obscure a button 
      to another page so that the user may click on it in the expectation of a different action. 
      So, in this way the attacker is "hijacking" the "Click" on a button meant by the user to be sent to host A, 
      while clicking the button in effect sends a message to host B.
      If the user does for example also have an open session with host B this can lead to a CSRF attack 
      and executing a command in the session context of the user (using the user's authentication and authorization) 
      on host B without his intention or knowledge.</t>

      <t>The by "Frame-Options" provided defense mechanism against Clickjacking is to allow a secure web page from host B to declare that its content 
      (for example a button, links, text, etc.) must not be displayed in a frame of another page 
      (e.g. from host A). In principle this is done by a policy declared in the HTTP header and obeyed
      by conform browser implementations.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

    <section title="Frame-Options Header">
    <t>The Frame-Options HTTP response header indicates a policy whether a browser MUST 
    NOT allow to render a page in a<![CDATA[ <frame> or <iframe> ]]>. Hosts can declare this policy in the 
    header of their HTTP responses to prevent clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content 
    is not embedded into other pages or frames.</t>
    <section title="Syntax">
	<t>The header field name is: 
<vspace /><vspace />
		Frame-Options
		
 	</t>

	<t>There are three different values for the header field. 
	These values are exclusive, that is NOT more than one of the three values MUST be set.
  	<list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
    <t hangText="DENY"><vspace />
          A browser receiving content with this header MUST NOT display this content in any frame.</t>
    <t hangText="SAMEORIGIN"><vspace />
          A browser receiving content with this header MUST NOT display this content in any frame from a page of different origin than the content itself.</t>
    <t hangText="TRUSTED"> (followed by a list of URIs of trusted origins)<vspace />
          A browser receiving content with this header MUST NOT display this content in any frame from a page of different origin than any of the listed origins. 
          This allows deployment with multi-domain sites, as the webmaster can define a whitelist of origins that are allowed to frame the page.
          While this can expose the page to risks by the trusted origins, in some cases it may be necessary to use content from other domains or more than one origin (hostname).</t>
