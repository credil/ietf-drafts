    <abstract>
      <t>The syntax for allowed Top-Level Domain (TLD) labels in
        the Domain Name System (DNS) is not clearly applicable
        to the encoding of Internationalised Domain Names (IDNs)
        as TLDs.</t>

      <t>This document provides a concise specification of TLD
	label syntax based on existing syntax documentation, extended
	minimally to accommodate IDNs.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The syntax of Top-Level Domain (TLD) labels in the
	Domain Name System (DNS) was specified somewhat imprecisely
	in <xref target="RFC1123"/> which required that TLD names
	be "alphabetic".  This is commonly interpreted as excluding
	the hyphen character and numeric digits from TLD labels.
	This restriction does not accommodate the US-ASCII encoding
	of Internationalised Domain Names (IDNs), as specified in
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-idnabis-defs"/>.  A more detailed
        discussion of the existing specifications can be found
        in <xref target="background"/>.</t>

      <t>This document updates the definition of allowable top-level
	domain names to support IDNs but places some restrictions
	on the choice of IDN labels, consistent with the existing
	specification for US-ASCII TLD labels.  See <xref
	target="specification"/> for the updated specification.</t>

      <t>This document focuses narrowly on the issue of allowable
	labels in TLDs and does not (and is not intended to)
	make any other changes or clarifications to existing domain
	name syntax rules.</t>

      <t>It is carefully noted that the specification in this
	document is not the only factor in choosing TLD labels, and
	that many considerations external to the IETF are included
	in that wider policy.  See <xref target="policy"/> for more
	discussion of policy considerations.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Background" anchor="background">
      <t><xref target="RFC0952"/> defines a host name as follows:

        <list style="empty">
          <t>'A "name" ... is a text string up to 24 characters
            drawn from the alphabet (A-Z), digits (0-9), minus sign
            (-), and period (.).  Note that periods are only allowed
            when they serve to delimit components of "domain style
            names".  (See RFC-921, "Domain Name System Implementation
            Schedule", for background).  No blank or space characters
            are permitted as part of a name.  No distinction is made
            between upper and lower case.  The first character must
            be an alpha character.  The last character must not be
            a minus sign or period.' [Unnumbered section titled
            "ASSUMPTIONS", first paragraph]</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t><xref target="RFC1123"/> reaffirms this
        definition, making two additional changes to the syntax:

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>'The syntax of a legal Internet host name was specified
            in RFC-952 [DNS:4].  One aspect of host name syntax is
            hereby changed: the restriction on the first character
            is relaxed to allow either a letter or a digit.  Host
            software MUST support this more liberal syntax.' [Section
            2.1]</t>

          <t>'However, a valid host name can never have the
            dotted-decimal form #.#.#.#, since at least the
            highest-level component label will be alphabetic.'
            [Section 2.1]</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>Neither <xref target="RFC0952"/> nor <xref target="RFC1123"/>
	explicitly states the reasons for these restrictions.  It
	might be supposed that human factors considerations were
	involved; <xref target="RFC1123"/> appears to suggest that
	one of the reasons was to prevent confusion between
	dotted-decimal IPv4 addresses and host domain names.  In any
	case, it is reasonable to believe that the restrictions are
	often assumed in deployed software, and that changing the
	rules should be undertaken with caution.</t>

      <t>The Internationalised Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)
        2008 specification provides a protocol for encoding
        unicode strings in DNS labels.  The unicode string used by
        applications is known as a U-Label; its corresponding
        encoding in the DNS is known as an A-Label.  The terms A-Label
        and U-Label are used in this document as defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-idnabis-defs"/>.  Valid A-Labels always
        contain non-alphabetic characters.</t>

      <t>In order to accommodate the wish to express TLD names in
	scripts other than Latin (or rather, the US-ASCII subset
	of Latin), it is necessary to allow non-alphabetic characters
	in TLD DNS labels.  To make the change as small as possible,
	we restrict the U-label form of the label in ways functionally
	compatible with the restrictions (from <xref target="RFC0952"/>
	and <xref target="RFC1123"/>) on US-ASCII labels for TLDs.
	This restriction will not enable new A-label TLDs to function
	with existing software that checks DNS top-level labels for
	conformance with the alphabetic restriction.  It merely makes
	the same traditional rule work in a similar way for IDNA
	top-level labels.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="TLD Label Syntax Specification" anchor="specification">
      <t>This document relaxes the existing specification to allow
	TLD labels to be well-formed A-Labels, but places restrictions
	on the corresponding U-Labels.</t>

      <figure>
        <preamble>The ABNF expression that matches a valid TLD
          label is as follows:</preamble>

        <artwork type="abnf">
          tldlabel = traditional-tld-label / idn-label


          traditional-tld-label = 1*63(ALPHA)

          idn-label = Restricted-A-Label

          ALPHA    = %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>Restricted-A-label is an A-Label as defined in
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-idnabis-defs"/> converted from (and
	convertible to) a U-Label that is consistent with the
	definition in <xref target="I-D.ietf-idnabis-defs"/> and that
	is further restricted to contain only Unicode characters
	with the derived property value PVALID and of General
	Category "L" or "Mn".  Note that "L" contains several
	sub-categories, and that many characters of the "L" category
	do not have the derived property value PVALID.  Most emphatically,
	this specification does not allow use of any character in a
	Restricted-A-Label that has derived property value of
	CONTEXT.</t>

      <t>More specifically, a Restricted-A-Label consists of one or
	more Unicode characters such that all of the following
	statements are true:

        <list style="numbers">
	  <t>the label is a valid A-Label according to
	    <xref target="I-D.ietf-idnabis-defs"/>;</t>
	  <t>the derived property value of all codepoints, as defined
	    by <xref target="I-D.ietf-idnabis-defs"/>, is PVALID;</t>
	  <t>the general category of all codepoints, is one of {
	    Ll, Lo, Lm, Mn }.</t>
	</list>
      </t>

      <t>This new specification reflects current practice in
	registration of TLD names by the IANA, extended to
        accommodate IDNs.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Policy Considerations" anchor="policy">
      <t>This document provides a technical specification for
	TLD label syntax; it does not encapsulate a complete policy
	under which TLD names may be chosen.</t>

      <t>At the time of writing, the policy under which TLD names
        are chosen is developed and maintained by ICANN in
        consultation with a wide base of stakeholders.  As the
        Internet continues to grow to serve new user communities,
        applications and services, it is to be expected that the 
        corresponding policy will be changed accordingly.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document makes no requests of the IANA.</t>

      <t>This section needs IANA review.  :-)</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document is believed to have limited security
	implications.</t>

      <t>The creation of new TLDs has the potential to conflict
	with software which (for example) does not accommodate TLD
	labels which did not exist at the time the software was
	written.  Such software problems might in turn lead to
	security vulnerabilities; e.g., in the event that a DNS name
	specified by a user is truncated or otherwise misinterpreted,
	causing an application to interact with a different remote
	host from that which the user intended.  It should be noted
	that this is not a new phenomenon, and has been observed
	following the creation of new TLDs prior to the publication
	of this document.</t>

      <t>The issue of characters that can be confused with each other
        is a risk, but it is discussed at length in the Security
        Considerations section of
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-idnabis-defs"/>.</t>
