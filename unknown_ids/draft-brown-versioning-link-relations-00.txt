Internet-Draft      Version Navigation Link Relations          June 2009


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines link relations that may be used on a
   resource that exists in a system that supports versioning to navigate
   among the different resources available, such as past versions.


2.  Terminology

   The terms below are borrowed from the Versioning Extensions to WebDAV
   (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) ([RFC3253]).

   Version-Controlled Resource, Checked-Out

      When a versionable resource is put under version control, it
      becomes a "version-controlled resource".  A version-controlled
      resource can be "checked out" to allow modification.

   Checked-Out Resource

      A "checked-out resource" is a resource under version control that
      is in the checked-out state.

   Version Resource

      A "version resource", or simply "version", is a resource that
      contains a copy of a particular state of a version-controlled
      resource.  A version is created by "checking in" a checked-out
      resource.  The server allocates a distinct new URL for each new
      version.

   Version History Resource

      A "version history resource", or simply "version history", is a
      resource that contains all the versions of a particular version-
      controlled resource.

   Predecessor, Successor, Ancestor, Descendant

      When a version-controlled resource is checked out and then
      subsequently checked in, the version that was checked out becomes
      a "predecessor" of the version created by the checkin.  A client
      can specify multiple predecessors for a new version if the new
      version is logically a merge of those predecessors.  When a
      version is connected to another version by traversing one or more
      predecessor relations, it is called an "ancestor" of that version.
      The inverse of the predecessor and ancestor relations are the
      "successor" and "descendant" relations.  Therefore, if X is a

      predecessor of Y, then Y is a successor of X, and if X is an
      ancestor of Y, then Y is a descendant of X.

   Root Version Resource

      The "root version resource", or simply "root version", is the
      version in a version history that is an ancestor of every other
      version in that version history.

   Working Resource

      A "working resource" is a checked-out resource created by the
      server at a server-defined URL when a version (instead of a
      version-controlled resource) is checked out.
      [[issue.working.resource: Is this true for JCR and CMIS as well?
      Maybe we need to relax the definition? --jre]]


3.  Link Relations

   The following link relations are defined:

   all-versions  When included on a version controlled resource, this
      link points to a resource containing the version history for this
      resource.

   latest-version  When included on a version controlled resource, this
      link points to a resource containing the latest (e.g., current)
      version. [[issue.latest.version: I think "latest" is misleading,
      as it may not be the "latest" when different branches are
      involved.  JCR 1.0 has "base version", defined as "The base
      version of a particular node N is the one that will serve as the
      default immediate predecessor of the next version of N that is
      created." -- can we adopt that? (see
      <http://www.day.com/specs/jcr/1.0/8.2.3_The_Base_Version.html>).
      --jre]]

   working-copy  When included on a Checked-Out resource, this link
      points to a Working Resource. [[issue.working.resource.2: I think
      the working resource *is* checked out, and the link lives on
      either a version or version controlled resource (which stays
      checked in). --jre]]

   predecessor-version  When included on a version resource, this link
      points to a resource containing the predecessor version in the
      version history.

Internet-Draft      Version Navigation Link Relations          June 2009


   successor-version  When included on a version resource, this link
      points to a resource containing the successor version in the
      version history.


4.  Examples

   [[anchor2: To Be Done]]


5.  Security Considerations

   Automated agents should take care when these relation crosses
   administrative domains (e.g., the URI has a different authority than
   the current document).


6.  IANA Considerations

   The link relations defined in Section 3 are to be registered by IANA
   per [RFC4287].

   All link relations defined in this document will have the following
   expected display characteristics:

      Undefined; this relation can be used for background processing or
      to provide extended functionality without displaying its value.
