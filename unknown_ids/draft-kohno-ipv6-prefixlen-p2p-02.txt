           Using 127-bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter-Router Links
                 draft-kohno-ipv6-prefixlen-p2p-02.txt

Abstract

   On inter-router point-to-point links, it is useful for security and
   other reasons, to use 127-bit IPv6 prefixes.  Such a practice
   parallels the use of 31-bit prefixes in IPv4 [RFC3021].  This
   document outlines some of these reasons and specifies that 127-bit
   IPv6 prefix lengths must be supported on such links.

1.   Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   RFC 4291 [RFC4291] specifies that interface IDs for all unicast
   address, except those that start with the binary value 000, are
   required to be 64 bits long and to be constructed in Modified EUI-64
   format.  In addition, it defines the Subnet-Router anycast address,
   which is intended to be used for applications where a node needs to
   communicate with any one of the set of routers on a link.

   Some operators have been using 127-bit prefixes, but this has been
   discouraged due to conflicts with Subnet-Router anycast [RFC3627].
   However, using 64-bit prefixes creates security issues which are
   particularly problematic on inter-router links, and there are other
   valid reasons to use prefixes longer than 64 bits, in particular /127
   (see Section 5).

   This document provides rationale for using 127-bit prefix lengths,
   reevaluates the reasons why doing so was considered harmful, and
   specifies that /127 prefixes MUST be supported on inter-router links
   configured for use as point-to-point links.


3.  Scope Of This Memo

   This document is applicable to cases where operators assign specific
   addresses on inter-router point-to-point links and do not rely on
   link-local addresses.  Many operators assign specific addresses for
   purposes of network monitoring, reverse DNS resolution for traceroute
   and other management tools, EBGP peering sessions, and so on.

   For the purposes of this document, an inter-router point-to-point
   link is a link to which only two routers and no hosts are attached.
   This may include Ethernet links which are configured to be point-to-
   point.  In such cases, there is no need to support Neighbor Discovery
   for address resolution, and other general scenarios like the use of
   stateless addresss autoconfiguration are not relevant.

   Links between a router and a host, or links to which both routers and
   hosts are attached, are out of scope of this document.

4.  Problems identified with 127-bit prefix lengths in the past

   [RFC3627] discourages the use of 127-bit prefix lengths due to
   conflicts with the Subnet-Router anycast addresses, while stating
   that the utility of Subnet-Router Anycast for point-to-point links is
   questionable.

   [RFC5375] also says the usage of 127-bit prefix lengths is not valid
   and should be strongly discouraged, but the stated reason for doing
   this is to be in compliance with [RFC3627].

   Though the analysis in the RFCs are correct, it contradicts the
   reality as to the /127 discussion.  Given that Subnet-Router Anycast
   is not currently used, the RFCs could have been to recommend that
   Subnet-Router Anycast be disabled on prefixes that are 127 bits long.


5.  Reasons for using longer prefixes

   There are various reasons for network operators to use IPv6 prefix
   length greater than 64, particularly 127, for inter-router links.

5.1.  Ping-pong issue

   As described in [PINGPONG], a forwarding loop may occur on a point-
   to-point link with a prefix length shorter than 127.  This does not
   affect interfaces that perform Neighbor Discovery, but some point-to-
   point links, which uses medium such as SONET, do not use Neighbor
   Discovery.  As a consequence, configuring any prefix length shorter
   than 127 bits on these links can create an attack vector in the
   network.

   The pingpong issue happens in case of IPv4 as well.  But due to the
   scarcity of IPv4 address space, the current practice is to assgin
   long prefix lengths such as /30 or /31 [RFC3021] on point-to-point
   links, thus the problem did not come to the fore.

   The latest ICMPv6 specification [RFC4443] provides a solution to this
   issue by specifying that a router receiving a packet on a point-to-
   point link sent to an address on the link itself must not forward the
   packet back onto the same link, instead generating an ICMPv6
   Destination Unreachable (Code 3) message.  However, checking every
   packets for this condition could have some drawbacks.

5.2.  Neighbor Cache Exhaustion issue

   As described in Section 4.3.2 of [RFC3756], the use of a 64-bit
   prefix length on an inter-router link that uses Neighbor Discovery



Kohno, et al.           Expires January 30, 2011                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             IPv6 prefixlen p2p                  July 2010


   (e.g., Ethernet) potentially allows for denial-of-service attacks on
   the routers on the link.

   Consider an Ethernet link between two routers A and B to which a /64
   subnet has been assigned.  A packet sent to any address on the /64
   (except the addresses of A and B) will cause the router attempting to
   forward it to create an new cache entry in state INCOMPLETE, send a
   Neighbor Solicitation message to be sent on the link, start a
   retransmit timer, and so on [RFC4861].

   By sending a continuous stream of packets to a large number of the
   2^64 - 3 addresses on the link that are not assigned to the routers
   (one for each router and one for Subnet-Router Anycast), an attacker
   can cause the routers to create a large number of neighbor cache
   entries and send a large number of Neighbor Solicitation packets
   which will never receive replies, possibly consuming a
   disproportionate amount of memory and processing resources.  Sending
   the packets to one of the 2^24 addresses on the link that have the
   same Solicited-Node multicast address as of one of the routers also
   causes the other router to spend disproportionate amounts of
   processing time discarding useless Neighbor Solicitation messages.

   Careful implementation and rate-limiting can limit the impact of such
   an attack, but are unlikely to neutralize it completely.  Rate-
   limiting neighbor solicitation messages will reduce CPU usage, and
   following the garbage-collection recommendations in [RFC4861] will
   maintain reachability, but if the link is down and neighbor cache
   entries have expired while the attack is ongoing, legitimate traffic
   (for example, BGP sessions) over the link might never be re-
   established because the routers cannot resolve each others' IPv6
   addresses to MAC addresses.

   This attack is not specific to point-to-point links, but is
   particularly harmful in the case of point-to-point backbone links,
   which may carry large amounts of traffic to many destinations over
   long distances.

5.3.  Other reasons

   Though address space conservation considerations are less important
   for IPv6 than they are in IPv4, it may still be desirable to use the
   smallest possible prefix to number links (and thus use, for example,
   /127 for point-to-point links).  For example, a large end-site that
   is assigned a /48 of IPv6 space may not want to reserve a full /64
   for every point-to-point link to avoid renumbering in the future.

6.  Recommendations

      In light of the above reasons, this document specifies that 127-
      bit prefix lengths MUST be supported on inter-router point-to-
      point links, and proposes that such links MAY be assigned 127-bit
      prefix lengths.  If such a prefix is assigned to a link, Subnet-
      Router Anycast MUST be disabled for the prefix.

      The [RFC4291]is to be revised to allow longer prefix than /64, and
      state that Subnet-router anycast address MUST be disabled if the
      prefix length of the link is /127.
