     1. Introduction 

        This document defines a subset of the Management Information 
        Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols for power 
        and energy monitoring of network devices and devices attached to 
        the network, as specified in the Power Management Architecture 
        [EMAN-FMWK], which in turn, is based on the Power Monitoring 
        Requirements [EMAN-REQ] . 
         
        This module's special focus is on monitoring energy-aware 
        networks and devices.  The module addresses device 
        identification, context information, and relationships between 
        reporting devices, remote devices, and monitoring probes. 
      
        Devices and their sub-components may be characterized by the 
        power-related attributes of a physical entity present in the 
        ENTITY MIB, even though ENTITY MIB compliance is not a 
        requirement due to the variety and broad base of devices 
        concerned with energy management. 
         
     1.1. Energy Management Document Overview 

        The EMAN standards provides network administrators with energy 
        management.   
        This document, which specifies the Energy-aware Networks and 
        Devices MIB document is based on the Energy Management Framework 
        [EMAN-FMWK], per the Energy Management requirements specified in 
        [EMAN-REQ], which allows networks and devices to become energy 
        aware. 
                           
        The Power and Energy Monitoring MIB [EMAN-MON-MIB] contains the  
        managed objects for monitoring of power states and energy 
        consumption/production.  The monitoring of power states 
        includes: retrieving power states, properties of power states, 
        current power state, power state transitions, and power state 
        statistics. This MIB provides the detailed properties of the

        actual energy rate (power) and of accumulated energy, along with 
        the power quality. 
         
        The applicability statement document [EMAN-AS] provides the list 
        of use cases, cross-reference between existing standards and the 
        EMAN standard, and shows how the EMAN framework relates to other 
        frameworks. 
           
        EDITOR'S NOTE: [EMAN-MON-MIB] and [EMAN-AS] are not EMAN working 
        group documents.  Hence, these references will be changed in the 
        future. 
         
         
     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
        current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
        section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant with  
        SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, 
        RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
         
     3. Use Cases 

        Requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking 
        devices are specified in [EMAN-REQ].  The requirements in [EMAN-
        REQ] cover devices typically found in communications networks, 
        such as switches, routers, and various connected endpoints.  For 
        a power monitoring architecture to be useful, it should also 
        apply to facility meters, power distribution units, gateway 
        proxies for commercial building control, home automation 
        devices, and devices that interface with the utility and/or 
        smart grid.  Accordingly, the scope of the MIB modules in this 
        document is broader than that specified in [EMAN-REQ]. 
         
         
     4. Terminology 

       The definitions of basic terms like Energy Management, Energy 
       Monitoring, "Power, Energy, and Energy Consumption", Power 
       Monitor, Power Monitor Parent, Power Monitor Child, Power

       Monitor Meter Domain, Power Level, and Manufacturer Power Level, 
       Nameplate Power, Power Proxy, Power Aggregator, Power 
       Distributor can be found in the Power Management Architecture 
       [EMAN-FMWK]. 
        
       EDITOR'S NOTE: not sure if all terms will be used in the final 
       version of the draft 
        
       EDITOR'S NOTE: [EMAN-FMWK] is an informational non normative 
       reference. Is this fine? 
        
        
     5. Architecture Concepts Applied to the MIB Module 

        This section describes the basic concepts specified in the Power 
        Monitor Architecture [EMAN-FMWK], with specific information 
        related to the MIB module specified in this document   
        This subsection maps to the section "Architecture High Level 
        Concepts" in the Power Monitoring Architecture [EMAN-FMWK]. 
      
         
         
     5.1 Power Monitor Information    

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Information" section in [EMAN-FMWK] 
        for background information.  An energy aware device is 
        considered an instance of a power monitor as defined in the 
        [EMAN-FMWK]. 
         
        The Power Monitor information is specified in the MIB module 
        primary table, i.e. the pmTable.  Every Power Monitor SHOULD 
        have a printable name pmName, and MUST HAVE a unique Power 
        Monitor index pmIndex. 
         
        The pmIndex is a unique index greater than zero for each Power 
        Monitor.  It is recommended that values be assigned sequentially 
        starting from 1.  The value for each pmIndex must remain 
        constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's 
        network management system to the next re-initialization.  In 
        addition, the Power Monitor can potentially have an 
        entityPhysicalIndex from the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133] in the 
        pmPhysicalEntity, if supported by the Power Monitor.  In case of 
        Power over Ethernet (if the Power over Ethernet MIB is supported 
        on the Power Monitor), the Power Monitor pmethPortIndex and 
        pmethPortGrpIndex must contain the values of pethPsePortIndex 
        and pethPsePortGroupIndex, respectively.  In case of LLDP-MED 
      
      
     <Parello, Claise>       Expires June 22, 2011            [Page 5] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Energy-aware Networks and Devices MIB>  Dec 2010 
      
        (if the LLDP-MED MIB is supported on the Power Monitor), the 
        Power Monitor pmLldpPortNumber must contain the lldpLocPortNum 
        from the LLDP MIB.    
         
        Possible pmName conventions are: textual DNS name, MAC-address 
        of the device, interface ifName, or a text string uniquely 
        identifying the Power Monitor.  However, if entPhysicalName is 
        present for the respective pmPhysicalEntity (i.e. if the ENTITY-
        MIB is supported), then the pmName SHOULD be identical to the 
        entPhysicalName.  The pmName SHOULD be unique.  As an example, 
        in the case of IP phones, pmName can be the device DNS name, 
        while in the case of router/switch line cards, the pmName should 
        contain the entPhysicalName.   
         
        To distinguish if a Power Monitor is considered producing, 
        consuming or metering power, the pmPowerCategory MIB object must 
        be implemented.  
      
         
       5.2 Power Monitor Meter Domain 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Meter Domain" section in [EMAN-FMWK] 
        for background information. 
      
        When a Power Monitor Parent acts as a Power Aggregator or a 
        Power Proxy, the Power Monitor Parent and its Power Monitor 
        Child/Children MUST be a member of Power Monitor Meter Domain, 
        specified by the pmDomainName MIB Object.  The pmDomainName, 
        which is part of the pmTable, is a read-write MIB object. 
        The Power Monitor Meter Domain SHOULD map 1-1 with a metered or 
        sub-metered portion of the site.  The Power Monitor Meter Domain 
        MUST be configured on the Power Monitor Parent.  The Power 
        Monitor Children MAY inherit their domain values from the Power 
        Monitor Parent or the Power Monitor Meter Domain MAY be 
        configured directly in a Power Monitor Child.  
         
         
         
       5.3 Power Monitor Parent and Child 

       Refer to the "Power Monitor Parent and Child" section in [EMAN-
       FMWK] for background information.  In order to link the Power 
       Monitor Child and the Power Monitor Parent, the pmParentId is 
       introduced.  When a Power Monitor Parent is a Power Proxy, , the 
       Power Monitor Parent should enumerate the capabilities it is 
       providing for the Power Monitor Child.  The Power Monitor Child 
       expresses, thanks to the pmParentCapabilities MIB object, that 
       it wants its parent to proxy capabilities such as, energy

       reporting, power state configurations, non physical wake 
       capabilities (such as WoL)), or any combination of capabilities. 
      
      
       5.4 Power Monitor Context 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Context" section in [EMAN-FMWK] for 
        background information. 
         
        A Power Monitor can provide a pmImportance value in the range of 
        1..100 to help differentiate the use or relative value to the 
        site.  The importance range is from 1 (least important) to 100 
        (most important).  The default importance value is 1.   
      
        A Power Monitor can provide a set of pmKeywords.  These keywords 
        are a list of tags that can be used for grouping and summary 
        reporting within or between Power Monitor Meter Domains. 
         
        Additionally, a Power Monitor can provide a pmRoleDescription 
        string that indicates the purpose the Power Monitor serves in 
        the network or for the site/business. 
         

         
     6. Structure of the MIB 

        The primary MIB object in this MIB module is the 
        EnergyAwareDeviceMIBObject.  The pmTable table of 
        EnergyAwareDeviceMIBObject describes an entity in the network 
        that is a Power Monitor according the [EMAN-FMWK]. 

        A Power Monitor that implements the EnergyAwareDeviceMIB 
        contains information describing itself as an entity in the 
        context of the network (such as its Power Monitor Meter Domain 
        pmDomainName) and attributes for describing its business context 
        (such as pmImportance, pmRoleDescription and pmKeywords).  

        The information in this MIB describes the device itself so that 
        the device is aware of its context in a communication network 
        with respect to power.  The actual power usage, which is 
        described in [EMAN-FMWK], is specified in [EMAN-MON-MIB].

     8. Security Considerations  

        Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
        thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these 
        objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects 
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.   
         
        There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB 
        modules with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
        create.  Such objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable 
        in some network environments.  The support for SET operations in 
        a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
        negative effect on network operations.  The following are the 
        tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         
          . Unauthorized changes to the pmDomainName, pmName, 
             pmRoleDescription, pmKeywords, and/or pmImportance MAY 
             disrupt power and energy collection, and therefore any 
             predefined policies defined in the network. 
         
      
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
      
      
     <Parello, Claise>       Expires June 22, 2011           [Page 18] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Energy-aware Networks and Devices MIB>  Dec 2010 
      
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using 
        IPsec), there is still no secure control over who on the secure 
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB modules. 
         
         
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 
         
         
     9. IANA Considerations 

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
         
          Descriptor                         OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
          ----------                         ----------------------- 
          energyAwareMIB   { mib-2 xxx } 
                     
        Additions to this MIB module are subject to Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested MIB objects for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description.  Requests for MIB objects that duplicate the 
        functionality of existing objects SHOULD be declined.  The 
        smallest available OID SHOULD be assigned to a new MIB objects.  
        The specification of new MIB objects SHOULD follow the structure 
        specified in Section 6 and MUST be published using a well-
        established and persistent publication medium.
