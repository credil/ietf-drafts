          Advantages of using an IPFIX File Format for SIPCLF
                    draft-niccolini-sipclf-ipfix-00

Abstract

   The SIPCLF WG is currently trying to identify file format(s) suitable
   for its scope as defined in the current charter.  The group has so
   far received proposals for a text format and an indexed-text format
   that are going to be soon combined.  Several people believe that
   IPFIX could be a valid alternative to these two proposals for several
   reasons detailed in this document.

   This document discusses the main advantages related to the usage of
   IPFIX file format for SIPCLF.  Additionally it gives preliminary
   indications on the basic set of information elements that would need
   to be defined by the SIPCLF WG.

Internet-Draft              IPFIX for SIPCLF               February 2010


1.  Introduction

   The SIPCLF WG is chartered to produce a format suitable for logging
   at any SIP element.  The charter explicitly addresses the need to
   search, merge and summarize log records from one or more possibly
   diverse elements as well as the need to correlate messages from
   multiple elements.  An additional consideration to be taken into
   account when defining the file format is the extensibility of SIP.
   The SIPCLF WG is chartered to identify the fields to appear in a log
   record and provide one or more formats for encoding those fields.
   Specifying the mechanics of exchanging, transporting, and storing SIP
   Common Log Format records is explicitly out of scope.

   This document tries to detail why a file format based on IPFIX would
   make sense for SIPCLF, trying to highlight the main advantages
   correlated to it.  The intention of the authors is to consider both
   the needs of finding an easy solution today, as well as one that is
   also ready to accommodate future requirements asily.


2.  Why IPFIX makes sense for SIPCLF

   These are the main advantages in favor of IPFIX:
   o  The IPFIX Information Model.  The primary advantage of IPFIX is
      that it already contains an Information Model, initially based on
      [RFC5102] and updated with IANA
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipfix/ipfix.xhtml.  The PSAMP
      protocol [RFC5476] also uses the IPFIX protocol and therefore the
      same IANA IPFIX registry.  Note that, referring to "On the
      Difference between Information Models and Data Models" [RFC3444],
      one could argue whether the IANA IPFIX registry is an information
      model or a data model.
   o  IPFIX has a self-describing syntax model that allows the
      definition of a common set of "standard" fields to be recorded in
      the SIPCLF record.  Specifically, a standard-defined IPFIX record
      template can be agreed upon and published, which contains the
      common SIP fields the group wishes to record.
   o  Both SIP extensibility and vendor-specific requirements (e.g.,
      vendor X want to record proprietary info A/B/C, vendor Y want to
      record D/E/F info) indicate that more will be needed on top of the
      "standard" subset (in addition to the fact that the "standard set"
      will undoubtedly grow over time, too).  This will drive the need
      for a way to type-indicate that vendor-proprietary and future spec
      info in the file, which the IPFIX format already supports.
   o  There are a number of applicable tools that already parse IPFIX
      today from routers/data-boxes.  The ability to reuse these tools
      for SIPCLF scopes would avoid re-inventing the wheel for SIP.

   o  The requirements that lead to the definition of a file format
      today will soon be augmented by additional requirements that lead
      to the definition of a protocol mechanism to export the log record
      to collectors, then filtering controls/config., etc., which IPFIX
      has already defined in the past.
   o  IPFIX supports both binary and ascii record field values.  If, at
      some point in time, SIPCLF needs to support encoding the entire
      SIP Message, a binary-capable encoding is necessary since SIP
      Messages can contain binary bodies (e.g., ISUP, QSIG).
   o  IPFIX records support length encoding, thereby enabling a parser
      to skip past record fields or entire records without parsing their
      contents.

   These points suggest that, even if today file format has potentially
   not much overlap with the IPFIX one now, there are advantages in
   choosing IPFIX file format from the beginning of SIPCLF design.  This
   solution will allow quicker adoption in the beginning (thanks to the
   tools parsing IPFIX that are already available and can be reused
   right away) and avoid sub-optimality (e.g., proxy translating formats
   between each other) in the future.

2.1.  Thinking about the future

   Thinking about the future (even if the charter doesn't address these
   points), there are high chances that:
   o  The SIPCLF file format will have to include information elements
      that are already defined in the IANA IPFIX registry, combining SIP
      related information elements with flow related information
      elements.  For example, simply an IP address (refer to Section 5).
   o  The SIPCLF file format will have to include proprietary
      information elements, as multiple vendors will have to distinguish
      from each other.  IPFIX offers the ability to have proprietary
      information elements, called Enterprise-Specific Information
      Elements in [RFC5101].  In the future,
   o  In the future, the information contained the SIPCLF file format
      will have to be transferred (pushed or pulled) in order to do some
      correlation.  While a file can transferred with any protocol, such
      as FTP, TFTP, RCP, etc., using the IPFIX protocols offers some
      advantages: for example, a push mechanism and a single collection
      protocol for the performance management product, avoiding
      additional costly correlation tools for the integration of IPFIX
      information elements with SIPCLF file format.  When the charter
      mentions "Furthermore, these log records can also be used to train
      anomaly detection systems and feed events into a security event
      management system.", most tools in the market depend one way or
      the other on NetFlow version 9 [RFC3954], which is the basis
      protocol for IPFIX.

3.  IPFIX File Format

   A draft on using IPFIX for SIPCLF does not need to completely detail
   a file format - the "file format" is already defined in [RFC5655] and
   the SIPCLF one would be based on that.  The advantage of this file
   format is that it was already designed to facilitate interoperability
   and reusability among a wide variety of storage, processing, and
   analysis tools.


4.  Information Model and Information Elements for SIPCLF

   As defined in [RFC3444] the main purpose of an Information Model is
   to model managed objects at a conceptual level, independent of any
   specific implementations or protocols used to transport the data.

   This draft does not yet attempt to formally define information
   elements for SIPCLF.  Below you can find initial reasoning about the
   "standard set" needed for logging SIP events.

   Main information for SIPCLF log record is largely already defined in
   other documents, e.g., in [RFC3261].

   There are fundamentally two options depending on how detailed the
   information elements needs to be.  The first possible option is to
   keep the information elements coarse grained, e.g., for each SIP
   message that is logged, a Status-Line or Request-Line, an ordered
   list of pairs of where each pair has a header-name and a header-
   value, and finally zero or one message-bodies.  Additional
   information could be about where the message was coming from and
   going to from the transport layer as well as a timestamp.  The second
   option is to have fine grained definition of information elements,
   e.g., defining SIP to and from tags as elements themselves (the list
   could be extended to include Call-Id, CSeq, Max-Forwards, Via,
   Contact, etc.).  This draft does not favor one option or another as
   they both have pros and cons; the authors just want to point out that
   the definition of such information elements is going to be quite
   straightforward once the SIPCLF WG has agreed on the level of detail
   and complexity that SIPCLF log record requires (an example of these
   fields is available here [I-D.gurbani-sipclf-problem-statement].

   The authors wish to point out that there have been already attempts
   to define IPFIX information elements for when using IPFIX for SIP
   previously.  This has been discussed already in the IPFIX WG based on
   an expired draft (draft-huici-ipfix-sipfix-00), the paper that was
   linked with that draft is referenced here [IM.sipfix].  This solution
   clearly goes beyond what is the current chartered scope of SIPCLF WG
   but it is an useful reference with concrete examples on how the

   information elements that could be defined (excluding the information
   elements for the media plane that are out of scope for the SIPCLF
   WG).


5.  IPFIX file format for SIPCLF: an example visualized

   This section is meant to give a short example of how an IPFIX file
   format would look like in the case of SIPCLF in order to increase
   understanding of what IPFIx would mean for SIPCLF.  The SIPCLF fields
   used for defining the information elements (IEs) are meant to be just
   an example and are taken from available references of the SIPCLF WG
   [I-D.gurbani-sipclf-problem-statement].

   The information elements used by this example are shown in the table
   below; new Information Elements necessary for SIPCLF that are not yet
   registered with IANA have placeholder numbers ("AAA", "BBB", etc.)

   [OPEN ISSUES WITH THIS IE SET: sip(Request|From|To)URI duplicate an
   enormous amount of information; is there value in parsing these out?
   For example, do they not always share a scheme?  What about the host
   part; to what extent are these shared by To and Request, and how
   often are From and the sourceIPv[46]address the same?  Do hosts need
   to be stored as names or will addresses suffice?  What is a "tag"
   (From and To), and should it be separated; what structure does it
   have?  What, if any, structure is there to sip(Server|
   Client)Transaction: is this always just an opaque ASCII string?  Same
   question for sipCallId.  Even if there are not "always" answers, we
   can leverage templates here to significantly increase the efficiency
   of common cases while still handling technically legal but weird
   ones.  I'll start the box are bytefield drawing once these questions
   are answered; for now, here are tables describing the records.  Here
   I'm specifying separate request and response records, but parsing
   these and tracking them based on transaction associations seems
   somewhat cumbersome.  Is it possible to also provide a unified
   request/response template for the common case?  Are sip(Server|
   Client)Transaction always necessary, or just for forking and for
   associating requests to responses; can we leave them off otherwise?]

   A request record is then described by the following templates:

   A SIPCLF IPFIX file then consists of an IPFIX Message containing the
   template definitions above, followed by multiple IPFIX Messages
   containing the records in Data Sets corresponding to those template
   definitions, as in the figure below:

   Within each data set is one or more records, packed and encoded
   according to the template.  Fixed length fields appear in place
   without additional framing or length prefixing.  Variable length
   fields use length prefixing.  Values 0-254 bytes long can be
   represented using a single-byte length prefix, 0x00 - 0xFE.  Values
   0-65516 bytes long can be represented using a three-byte length
   prefix, 0xFF followed by the length in network byte order.  All
   SIPCLF variable-length fields are strings, and all IPFIX strings are
   encoded using UTF8.

   [Note that the placement of data set and message boundaries are
   implementation dependent; some implementations may group and emit
   records by template, some may have only one record per data set or

   data set per message.  If SIPCLF requires strict ordering of records
   by time, this can be specified, but is not mandatory IPFIX or IPFIX
   File behavior.]


6.  Summary

   Quoted from Dave Harrington on the mailing list: "IPFIX already
   provides a protocol and a data modeling language.  In addition,
   [RFC5655] specifies a file format for storing data that has been
   received in the ipfix file format.  The IPFIX File format is designed
   to facilitate interoperability and reusability among a wide variety
   of flow storage, processing, and analysis tools.", let us ask the
   question differently: why would we have yet another data modeling
   language?


7.  Security Considerations

   To be worked out.


8.  IANA Considerations

   None.


9.  Acknowledgments

   Cullen Jennings and many others provided insightful discussions,
   specific comments and much needed corrections.
