1. INTRODUCTION

        The Domain Name System (DNS) is the standard way
   that Internet nodes locate information about addresses,
   mail exchangers, and other data relating to remote Internet
   nodes. [Mock87a, Mock87b] More recently, the IETF have
   defined standards-track security extensions to the
   DNS. [AALMR05] These security extensions can be used to
   authenticate signed DNS data records and can also be used to
   store signed public keys in the DNS.  Further, the IETF have
   defined a standards-track approach to enable secure dynamic
   update of DNS records over the network. [Well00]

        This document defines two new optional Resource
   Records.  This note specifies the syntax and other items
   required for independent implementations of these four DNS
   resource records.  The reader is assumed to be familiar with
   the basics of DNS, including familiarity with [Mock87a]
   [Mock87b].

        This document is not on the IETF standards-track
   and does not specify any level of standard.  This document
   merely provides information for the Internet community.

2. NEW RESOURCE RECORDS

        This document specifies two new and closely related
   DNS Resource Records (RRs).  The two new RR types have the
   mnemonics "L" and "I".  The L and I records are associated
   with a fully-qualified domain name.

        These resource records are not on the IETF standards
   track and are not standards of any sort.  Instead, these
   records are defined for use in limited deployment and
   experimental work within certain existing IP-based networks.

2.1 "L" Resource Record

     An "L" record has the DNS TYPE of "L" and a numeric value
   of <to be assigned by IANA>.  An "L" record is a member of
   the Internet ("IN") CLASS in the DNS.  Each L record is
   associated with a <domain-name> entry in the DNS.  The
   Preference field indicates the domain-name's relative
   preference for this particular L record among other L
   records for the same domain-name.

   An L record has the following logical components:
        <domain-name>  IN  L  <preference>   <L>

Internet Draft                  ILNP DNS                    10 June 2008


        In the above, <domain-name> is any valid domain name
   string, <preference> is an unsigned 16-bit value, while <L>
   is an unsigned 64-bit value that names a subnetwork where
   <domain-name> is directly attached.

        A given <domain-name> may have zero or more L values
   at a given time.  A multi-homed host will, by definition,
   have multiple L values while multi-homed.  A domain-name
   that is not a host may have an "L" record as a wild-card
   entry, in this case the domain-name must be naming a
   subnetwork.  This last usage is most common operationally
   when the named subnetwork is, was, or might become, mobile.

        The Preference field indicates the domain-name's
   relative preference for this L record among other L records
   associated with this domain-name.  Lower values are
   preferred.

     The L DNS record has the following RDATA format:

       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |               Preference                      |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |                                               |
       |                   L                           |
       |                                               |
       |                                               |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+


   where:

   Preference     A 16-bit unsigned integer which specifies the
                   preference given to this RR among others at
                   the same owner.  Lower values are preferred.

   L               A 64-bit unsigned integer that names a
                   subnetwork.

2.2 "I" Resource Record

   An I record has the following logical components:
        <domain-name>  IN  I  <preference>   <I>


        An "I" record has the DNS TYPE of "I" and a numeric
   value of <to be assigned by IANA>.  An "I" record is a
   member of the Internet ("IN") CLASS in the DNS.  Each I

Internet Draft                  ILNP DNS                    10 June 2008


   record is associated with a <domain-name> entry in the DNS.
   Only a <domain-name> that is associated with an Internet
   node may have an "I" record.  Any <domain-name> that is not
   a node on the Internet must not have an "I" record.

        The Preference field indicates the domain-name's
   relative preference for this I record among other I records
   associated with this domain-name.  Lower values are
   preferred.

        In the above <domain-name> is any valid domain name
   string, while <I> is an unsigned 64-bit value.  A given
   <domain-name> may have zero or more I records at a given
   time.  In normal operation, nodes that support the
   Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) will have at
   least one valid I record.

     The I DNS record has the following RDATA format:

       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |               Preference                      |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       |                                               |
       |                   I                           |
       |                                               |
       |                                               |
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+


   where:

   Preference     A 16-bit unsigned integer which specifies the
                   preference given to this RR among others at
                   the same owner.  Lower values are preferred.

   I               A 64-bit unsigned integer.


3. Usage Example

        Given a domain-name, one can use the Domain Name
   System (DNS) to discover the set of I records and the set
   of L records associated with that domain-name.  A given
   domain-name might have zero or more I records at a time
   and might have zero or more L records at a time.  This
   lookup process is considered to be in the "forward"
   direction.

Internet Draft                  ILNP DNS                    10 June 2008


        The preference fields associated with the I and L
   records are used to indicate the domain-name's preference
   for others to use one particular I or L record, rather than
   use another I or L record also associated with that
   domain-name.

        A DNS server should supply both the set of I
   records and the set of L records associated with a target
   <domain-name> upon receiving either an I request, an L
   request, or an AAAA request for that <domain-name>.

4. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS


        These new DNS resource record types do not create
   any new vulnerabilities.  Existing mechanisms for DNS
   security can be used unchanged with these record types.

        In situations where authentication of DNS data
   is a concern, the DNS Security extensions should be
   used.[AALMR05]

        If these DNS records are updated dynamically over
   the network, then the Secure Dynamic DNS Update [Well00]
   mechanism should be used to secure such transactions.


5. IANA CONSIDERATIONS

        IANA is requested to allocate each of these two DNS
   Resource Records a value from the "Specification Required"
   block (32768 - 65279) according to the procedures of Section
   3.1 on page 7 of RFC-2929 for "Specification Required".
