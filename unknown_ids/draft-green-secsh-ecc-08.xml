			<t>Due to its inclusion in National Security Agency's Suite B and its small key sizes elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is becoming a widely utilized and attractive public-key cryptosystem.</t>

			<t>In the interest of adding Suite B algorithms to SSH this document adds three ECC Suite B algorithms to the Secure Shell arsenal: Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV), Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), as well as utilizing the SHA2 family of secure hash algorithms.</t>
			
			<t>Compared to cryptosystems such as RSA, the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), and Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange, ECC variations on these schemes offer equivalent security with smaller key sizes.  This is illustrated in the following table, based on Section 5.6.1 of NIST 800-57 <xref target="NIST-800-57" />, which gives approximate comparable key sizes for symmetric- and asymmetric-key cryptosystems based on the best known algorithms for attacking them.  L is field size and N is sub-field size.</t>

		<section anchor="ecc" title="ECC Public Key Algorithm">

			<t>The ECC public key algorithm is defined by its key format, corresponding signature algorithm ECDSA, signature encoding and algorithm identifiers.</t>

			<t>This section defines the family of "ecdsa-sha2-*" public key formats and corresponding signature formats.  Every compliant SSH ECC implementation MUST implement this public key format.</t>

			<section anchor="ecc-key-format" title="Key Format">

				<t>The "ecdsa-sha2-*" key formats all have the following encoding:</t>

				<figure>
				<artwork>
   string   "ecdsa-sha2-[identifier]"
   byte[n]  ecc_key_blob</artwork>
				</figure>

				<t>The ecc_key_blob value has the following specific encoding:</t>
				<figure>
				<artwork>
   string   [identifier]
   string   Q</artwork>
				</figure>
	
				<t>The string [identifier] is the identifier of the elliptic curve domain parameters. The format of this string is specified in <xref target="names-curveid" />. Information on the required and recommended sets of elliptic curve domain parameters for use with this algorithm can be found in <xref target="params" />.</t>

				<t>Q is the public key encoded from an elliptic curve point into an octet string as defined in Section 2.3.3 of <xref target="SEC1" />; point compression MUST NOT be used.</t>

				<t>The algorithm for ECC key generation can be found in Section 3.2 of <xref target="SEC1" />.  Given some elliptic curve domain parameters, an ECC key pair can be generated containing a private key, an integer d, and a public key, an elliptic curve point Q.</t>

				<section anchor="ecc-sig-alg" title="Signature Algorithm">

					<t>Signing and verifying is done using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).  ECDSA is specified in <xref target="SEC1" />.  The message hashing algorithm must be from the SHA2 family of hash functions <xref target="FIPS-180-3" /> and is chosen according to the curve size as specified in <xref target="names-ecdsa" />.</t>

				</section>

				<section anchor="ecc-sig-enc" title="Signature Encoding">

					<t>Signatures are encoded as follows:</t>
					<figure>
					<artwork>
   string   "ecdsa-sha2-[identifier]"
   string   ecdsa_signature_blob</artwork>

					<t>The string [identifier] is the identifier of the elliptic curve domain parameters. The format of this string is specified in <xref target="names-curveid" />.

   mpint    r
   mpint    s</artwork>
					</figure>

					<t>The integers r and s are the output of the ECDSA algorithm.</t>

					<t>The width of the integer fields is determined by the curve being used.  Note that the integers r and s are integers modulo the order of the curve, which may be larger than the size of the finite field.  Thus, the integers r and s are encoded as octet strings each of length ciel(log[2](n)/8) using Section 2.3.7 of <xref target="SEC1" />, where n is the order of the elliptic curve group.</t>

	<section anchor="ecdh" title="ECDH Key Exchange">

		<t>The Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange method generates a shared secret from an ephemeral local elliptic curve private key and ephemeral remote elliptic curve public key.  This key exchange method provides explicit server authentication as defined in <xref target="RFC4253" /> using a signature on the exchange hash.  Every compliant SSH ECC implementation MUST implement ECDH Key Exchange.</t>

		<t>The primitive used for shared key generation is ECDH with cofactor multiplication, the full specification of which can be found in Section 3.3.2 of <xref target="SEC1" />.  The algorithm for key pair generation can be found in Section 3.2 of <xref target="SEC1" />.</t>
		
		<t>The family of key exchange method names defined for use with this key exchange can be found in <xref target="names-ecdh" />.  Algorithm negotiation chooses the public key algorithm to be used for signing and the method name of the key exchange.

		<t>*It is recommended that the client verify that the host key sent is the server's host key (using certificates or a local database).  The client is allowed to accept the host key without verification, but doing so will render the protocol insecure against active attacks; see the discussion in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC4251" />.</t>

	<section anchor="ecmqv" title="ECMQV Key Exchange">

		<t>The Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV) key exchange algorithm generates a shared secret from two local elliptic curve key pairs and two remote public keys.  This key exchange method provides implicit server authentication as defined in <xref target="RFC4253" />.  The ECMQV key exchange method is OPTIONAL.</t>
		
		<t>The key exchange method name defined for use with this key exchange is "ecmqv-sha2".  This method name gives a hashing algorithm that is to be used for the HMAC below.  Future RFCs may define new method names specifying new hash algorithms for use with ECMQV.  More information about the method name and HMAC can be found in <xref target="names-ecmqv" />.</t>
		
		<t>In general the ECMQV key exchange is performed using the ephemeral and long term key pair of both the client and server, a total of 4 keys.  Within the framework of SSH the client does not have a long term key pair that needs to be authenticated.  Therefore we generate an ephemeral key and use that as both the clients keys.  This is more efficient than using two different ephemeral keys and does not adversely affect security (it is analogous to the one-pass protocol in Section 6.1 of <xref target="LMQSV98" />).</t>
		
		<t>A full description of the ECMQV primitive can be found in Section 3.4 of <xref target="SEC1" />.  The algorithm for key pair generation can be found in Section 3.2 of <xref target="SEC1" />.</t>
		
		<t>During algorithm negotiation with the SSH_MSG_KEXINIT messages the ECMQV key exchange method can only be chosen if a Public Key Algorithm supporting ECC host keys can also be chosen.  This is due to the use of implicit server authentication in this key exchange method.  This case is handled the same way that key exchange methods requiring encryption/signature capable public key algorithms are handled in Section 7.1 of <xref target="RFC4253" />.  If ECMQV key exchange is chosen then the Public Key Algorithm supporting ECC host keys MUST also be chosen.</t>
		
		<t>ECMQV requires that all the keys used to generate a shared secret are generated over the same elliptic curve domain parameters.  Since the host key is used in the generation of the shared secret, allowing for implicit server authentication, the domain parameters associated with the host key are used throughout this section.</t>
		
		<t>All elliptic curve public keys MUST be validated after they are received.  An example of a validation algorithm can be found in A.16.10 of <xref target="IEEE1363" />.  If a key fails validation the key exchange MUST fail.</t>
		
		<t>The elliptic curve public keys (points) that must be transmitted are encoded into octet strings before they are transmitted.  The transformation between elliptic curve points and octet strings is specified in Sections 2.3.3 and 2.3.4 of <xref target="SEC1" />; point compression MAY be used.  The output of shared key generation is a field element xp.  The ssh framework requires that the shared key be an integer.  The conversion between a field element and an integer is specified in Section 2.3.9 of <xref target="SEC1" />.</t>

		<t>The Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement algorithm is defined in <xref target="SEC1" />.  The appropriate security considerations of that document apply.</t>
		
		<t>The Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone key agreement algorithm is defined in <xref target="SEC1" />.  The security considerations raised in that document also apply.  A more detailed discussion of security considerations can be found in Section 4.7 of the Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography <xref target="HMV04" />.</t>
		
		<t>The server's host key is used in the ECMQV key exchange algorithm.  This means that the strength of the server's ECC host key determines the strength of the ECMQV key exchange algorithm.  This should be taken into consideration when generating ECC keys for a server.</t>
		
		<t>The methods defined in <xref target="names" /> rely on the SHA2 family of hashing functions as defined in <xref target="FIPS-180-3" />.  The appropriate security considerations of that document apply.</t>

		<t>The hashing algorithms defined for use with ECDH and ECMQV are defined by their method names so that if security problems are found with the SHA2 family of hashing algorithms or more secure hashing algorithms become the standard then future documents can extend this document to include new hashing algorithms by defining new method names.</t>
		
		<t>Additionally a good general discussion of the security considerations that must be taken into account when creating an ECC implementation can be found in Section 5 of the Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography <xref target="HMV04" />.</t>
		
		<t>Since ECDH and ECMQV allow for elliptic curves of arbitrary sizes and thus arbitrary security strength, it is important that the size of elliptic curve be chosen to match the security strength of other elements of the SSH handshake.  In particular, host key sizes, hashing algorithms and bulk encryption algorithms must be chosen appropriately.  Information regarding estimated equivalence of key sizes is available in <xref target="NIST-800-57" />; the discussion in <xref target="RFC3766" /> is also relevant. We note in particular that when ECDSA is used as the signature algorithm and ECDH is used as the key exchange method, if curves of different sizes are used, then it is possible that different hash functions from the SHA2 family could be used.</t>
