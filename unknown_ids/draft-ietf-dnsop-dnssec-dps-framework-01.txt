          DNSSEC Signing Policy & Practice Statement Framework
                draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-dps-framework-01

Abstract

   This document presents a framework to assist writers of DNSSEC
   Signing Policy and Practice Statements such as Regulatory Authorities
   and Registry Managers on both the TLD and secondary level, who is
   operating a DNS zone with Security Extensions (DNSSEC) implemented.

   In particular, the framework provides a comprehensive list of topics
   that potentially (at the writer's discretion) needs to be covered in
   a DNSSEC Signing Policy definition and Practice Statement.

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC, RFC 4033
   [RFC4033]) is a set of IETF specifications for securing the Domain
   Name System.  DNSSEC provides a way for software to validate the
   authenticity of Domain Name System (DNS) data and that such data have
   not been modified during Internet transit.

   The DNS was not originally designed with strong security mechanisms
   to provide integrity and authenticity of DNS data.  Over the years, a
   number of vulnerabilities had been discovered that threaten the
   reliability and trustworthiness of the system.  DNSSEC addresses
   these vulnerabilities by adding data origin authentication, data
   integrity verification and authenticated denial of existence
   capabilities to DNS by incorporating public key cryptography into the
   DNS hierarchy.

   DNSSEC differs from the X.509 PKI in many ways.  For instance, in
   DNSSEC there is no central control of assurance or trust levels.
   Each zone manager may have its own way of managing keys and
   operations, and there is no necessity to perform any coordination
   between different zones or levels in the DNS.  The degree to which a
   relying party can trust the binding embodied in the DNSSEC chain is
   dependent on the weakest link in that chain.  As an implication of
   this nature, the security of domains becomes more critical the higher
   up in the DNS hierarchy one gets.

   To provide means for the relying parties to evaluate the trust and
   strength of the chain, registries may choose to publish DNSSEC
   Practice Statements (DPSs), comprising statements of critical
   security controls and procedures relevant to the relying parties.

   Even though this document is heavily inspired by RFC 3647 [RFC3647]
   and large parts drawn from that document, one significant difference
   is that the DPS framework is focused only on stating the security
   posture of the registry, rather than for all participants in the
   domain name system.  The DNS is almost of a ubiquitous nature, and
   there exists no agreements with the relying (third) parties, which is
   basically everyone using the Internet.

1.2.  Purpose

   The purpose of this document is twofold.  Firstly, the document aims
   to explain the concept of a DPS and describe the relationship between
   the DPS, the registry, the domain holders and the relying (third)
   parties.  Second, this document aims to present a framework to



Ljunggren, et al.      Expires September 24, 2010               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


   encourage and assist writers of DPSs in creating heterogenous and
   comparable policies and practices.  In particular, the framework
   identifies the elements that may need to be considered in formulating
   a DPS.  The purpose is not to define a particular Policy or Practice
   Statement, per se.  Moreover, this document does not aim to provide
   legal advice or recommendations as to particular requirements or
   practices that should be contained within a DPS.

1.3.  Scope

   The scope of this document is limited to discussion of the topics
   that can be covered in a DPS and does not go into the specific
   details that could possibly be included in each topic.  In
   particular, this document describes the types of information that
   should be considered for inclusion in a DPS.

   This DPS framework should be viewed and used as a tool that could act
   as a checklist of factors that should be taken in to consideration
   prior to deploying DNSSEC, and an outline to create a document that
   states the actual DNSSEC operations.  The framework is primarily
   aimed at organizations providing registry services, but may be used
   by high-value domain holders and serve as a check sheet for DNSSEC
   readiness at a high level.

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the general
   concepts of DNS, DNSSEC and PKI.


2.  Definitions


3.  Concepts

   This section describes the concept of a DNSSEC Signing Policy and
   Practices Statement.  Other related concepts are described as well.

3.1.  DPS

   Most DNSSEC participants may not have the need to create a thorough
   and detailed statement of practices.  For example, the registrant may
   itself be the relying party of its own zone and would already be
   aware of the nature and trustworthiness of its services.  In other
   cases, a Registry may provide registration services providing only a
   very low level of assurances where the domain names being secured may
   pose only marginal risks if compromised.  In these cases, an
   organization implementing DNS Security Extensions may only want to
   use a registrant agreement.  In such circumstances, that agreement
   may serve as the only "statement of practices" used by one or more



Ljunggren, et al.      Expires September 24, 2010               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


   registries within that Zone.  Consequently, that agreement may also
   be considered a DPS and can be entitled or subtitled as such.

   A DPS should contain information which is relevant to the DNSSEC
   participants.  Since the participants generally include the Internet
   community, it should not contain such information which could be
   considered to be sensitive details of a registry's operations, but
   rather reference such processes and procedures, which need not be
   public information.

   The DPS does not automatically constitute a contract and do not
   automatically bind DNSSEC participants as a contract would.  In most
   cases there exists no contractual agreement between the registry and
   the relying party.  Where a document serves the dual purpose of being
   a registrant agreement and a DPS, the document is intended to be part
   of a contract and constitutes a legally binding document to the
   extent that a registrant agreement would ordinarily be considered as
   such.

   Therefore, DPS's terms have a binding effect as contract terms only
   if a separate document creates a contractual relationship between the
   parties and where that document incorporates parts or all of the DPS
   by reference.

3.2.  Relationship between DNSSEC Signing Policy and Practice Statement

   A DNSSEC Signing Policy and a DNSSEC Practice Statement address the
   same set of topics that are of interest to the relying party in terms
   of the degree to and purpose for which a signature should be trusted.
   Their primary difference is in the focus of their provisions.  A
   Signing Policy sets forth the requirements and standards to be
   implemented for a DNSSEC Signed Zone.  In other words, the purpose of
   the Signing Policy is to establish what participants must do.  A
   Practice statement, by contrast, states how a Registry and other
   participants in a given Zone implement procedures and controls to
   meet the requirements stated in the Policy.  In other words, the
   purpose of the Practice Statement is to disclose how the participants
   perform their functions and implement controls.

   An additional difference between a Signing Policy and a Practice
   Statement relates the scope of coverage of the two kinds of
   documents.  Since a Signing Policy is a statement of requirements, it
   best serves as the vehicle for communicating minimum operating
   guidelines that must be met by complying parties.  Thus, a Signing
   Policy may apply to multiple Registries, multiple organizations, or
   multiple zones.  By contrast, a Practice Statement applies only to a
   single Registry or single organization.




Ljunggren, et al.      Expires September 24, 2010               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


   For example, a Regulatory Authority might define requirements in a
   Signing Policy for DNSSEC operations for one or more Registries.  The
   Signing Policy will be a broad statement of the general requirements
   for participants within the Registry's Zone.

   A registry may be required to write its own Practice Statement to
   support this Signing Policy by explaining how it meets the
   requirements of the Signing Policy.  Or, a Registry not governed by
   any Signing Policy may choose to publish a Practice Statement to
   provide transparency and gain community trust and acceptance.

   An additional difference between a Signing Policy and a Practice
   Statement concerns the level of detail of the provisions in each.
   Although the level of detail may vary, a Practice Statement will
   generally be more detailed than a Signing Policy.  A Practice
   Statement provides a detailed description of procedures and controls
   in place to meet the Signing Policy requirements, while a Signing
   Policy is more general.

   The main differences between a Signing Policy and Practice Statement
   can therefore be summarized as follows:

   (a)  Operation of a DNS Zone with DNSSEC may be governed by a Signing
        Policy, to establish requirements that state what the parties
        within the zone must do.  A single Registry or organization can
        use a Practice Statment to disclose how it meets the
        requirements of a Signing Policy or how it implements its
        practices and controls.
   (b)  A Signing Policy may facilitate interoperation of level of trust
        through several parts or levels in the DNS hierarchy.  By
        contrast, a Practice Statement is a statement of a single
        Registry or organization.
   (c)  A Practice Statement is generally more detailed than a Signing
        Policy and specifies how the Registry meets the requirements
        specified in the one or more Signing Policies under which it
        operates DNSSEC.

3.3.  Set of provisions

   A set of provisions is a collection of Signing Policy and/or Practice
   statements, spanning a range of standard topics for use in expressing
   a Signing Policy or Practice Statement employing the approach
   described in this framework by covering the topics appearing in
   Section 5 below.  They are also described in detail in Section 4
   below.

   A Signing Policy can be expressed as a single set of provisions.




Ljunggren, et al.      Expires September 24, 2010               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


   A Practice Statement can be expressed as a single set of provisions
   with each component addressing the requirements of one or more
   Signing Policies, or, alternatively, as an organized collection of
   sets of provisions.  For example, a Practice Statement could be
   expressed as a combination of the following:

   (a)  a list of Signing Policies supported by the DPS;
   (b)  for each Signing Policy in (a), a set of provisions that
        contains statements responding to that Signing Policy by filling
        in details not stipulated in that policy or expressly left to
        the discretion of the Signing Policy (in its Practice
        Statement); such statements serve to state how this particular
        Practice Statement implements the requirements of the particular
        Signing Policy; or
   (c)  a set of provisions that contains statements regarding the
        practices of the DNSSEC operations, regardless of Signing
        Policy.

   The statements provided in (b) and (c) may augment or refine the
   stipulations of an applicable Signing Policy, but generally must not
   conflict with any of the stipulations of such Signing Policy.  In
   certain cases, however, a Policy Authority may permit exceptions to
   the requirements in a Signing Policy, because certain compensating
   controls of the registry are disclosed in its DPS that allow the
   registry to provide assurances that are equivalent to the assurances
   provided by registries that are in full compliance with the DPS.

   This framework outlines the contents of a set of provisions, in terms
   of eight primary components, as follows:

   1.  Introduction
   2.  Publication and Repositories
   3.  Operational Requirements
   4.  Facilities, Management, and Operational Controls
   5.  Technical Security Controls
   6.  Zone Signing
   7.  Compliance Audit
   8.  Legal Matters

   Policy authorities can use this framework of eight primary components
   to write a DNSSEC Signing Policy.  Moreover, a Registry can use this
   same framework to write a DNSSEC Practice Statement.

   Therefore, a Registry can establish a set of basic documents (with a
   Signing Policy, Practice statement, and Registrant agreement) all
   having the same structure and ordering of topics, thereby
   facilitating comparisons and mappings among these documents and among
   the corresponding documents of other Zones.

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


   This basic framework may also be useful for the establishing of
   agreements with registrars or outsourcing of certain services.

   Drafters of DPSs are permitted to add additional levels of
   subcomponents below the subcomponents described in Section 4 for the
   purpose of meeting the needs of the drafter's particular
   requirements.


4.  Contents of a set of provisions

4.1.  Introduction

   This component identifies and introduces the set of provisions, and
   indicates the types of entities and applications for which the
   document (either the Signing Policy or the Practice Statement being
   written) is targeted.

4.1.1.  Overview

   This subcomponent provides a general introduction to the document
   being written.  This subcomponent can also be used to provide a
   synopsis of the community to which the Signing Policy or Practice
   Statement applies.

4.1.2.  Document Name and Identification

   This subcomponent provides any applicable names or other identifiers
   of the document.

4.1.3.  Community and Applicability

   This subcomponent addresses the stakeholders in DNSSEC along with the
   expected roles and responsibilities.  This includes but are not
   limited to an entity signing the zone, an entity that relies on the
   signed zone, other entities that have operational dependency on the
   signed zone and an entity that entrusted the zone signing.

4.1.4.  Specification Administration

   This subcomponent includes the name and mailing address of the
   organization that is responsible for drafting, registering,
   maintaining, and updating of the DPS.  It also includes the name,
   electronic mail address and telephone number of a contact person.  As
   an alternative to naming an actual person, the document may name a
   title or role, an e-mail alias, and other generalized contact
   information.  In some cases, the organization may state that its
   contact person, alone or in combination with others, is available to

   answer questions about the document.

   Moreover, when a formal or informal Policy Authority is responsible
   for determining whether a Registry should be allowed to operate a
   Zone, it may wish to approve the DPS of the Registry as being
   suitable for the Policy Authority's Signing Policy.  If so, this
   subcomponent can include the name or title, electronic mail address
   (or alias), telephone number and other generalized information of the
   entity in charge of making such a determination.  Finally, in this
   case, this subcomponent also includes the procedures by which this
   determination is made.

4.2.  Publication and Repositories

   This component contains any applicable provisions regarding:

   o  An identification of the entity or entities that operate
      repositories within the community, such as a Registry;
   o  The responsibility of a registry to publish information regarding
      its practices, public keys, and the current status of such keys,
      which may include the responsibilities of making the DPS publicly
      available using various mechanisms and of identifying components,
      subcomponents, and elements of such documents that exist but are
      not made publicly available, for instance, security controls,
      clearance procedures, or business information due to their
      sensitivity;
   o  When information must be published and the frequency of
      publication; and
   o  Access control on published information objects.


4.3.  Operational Requirements

   This component describes the operational requirements when operating
   DNSSEC.

4.3.1.  Meaning of domain names

   This section describes the meaning of names in child zones, if any.

4.3.2.  Activation of DNSSEC for child zone

   This section describes how the child zone would be tied into the
   parent zone by incorporating DS record into the zone.

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


4.3.3.  Identification and authentication of child zone manager

   This section will specify the methodology of identifying and
   authenticating the requester of the child zone to determine whether
   the request is valid or not.

4.3.4.  Registration of delegation signer (DS) resource records

   This section describes how the delegation signer resource records are
   incorporated into the parent zone.

4.3.5.  Method to prove possession of private key

   This section describes how the child zone manager proves the
   possession of the Key Signing Key to the parent zone when requesting
   a delegation signer resource record to be incorporated.

4.3.6.  Removal of DS resource records

   This section will explain how, when and under which circumstances the
   DS record may be removed from the zone file.

4.4.  Management, Operational, and Physical Controls

   This component describes non-technical security controls (that is,
   physical, procedural, and personnel controls) used by the Registry to
   securely perform the DNSSEC related functions such as key management,
   zone signing, key roll-over, zone distribution, auditing and
   archiving.

   These non-technical security controls are critical for trusting the
   signatures since lack of security may compromise DNSSEC operations
   resulting for example, in the creation of signatures with erroneous
   information or compromising the Key Signing Key and/or Zone Signing
   Key.

   Within each subcomponent, separate consideration will, in general,
   need to be given to each entity type.

4.4.1.  Physical Controls

   In this subcomponent, the physical controls on the facility housing
   the entity systems are described.  Topics addressed may include:

   o  Site location and construction, such as the construction
      requirements for high-security areas and the use of locked rooms,
      cages, safes, and cabinets;




Ljunggren, et al.      Expires September 24, 2010              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


   o  Physical access, i.e., mechanisms to control access from one area
      of the facility to another or access into high-security zones,
      such as locating Registry operations in a secure computer room
      monitored by guards, cameras or security alarms and requiring
      movement from zone to zone to be accomplished using a token,
      biometric readers, and/or access control lists;
   o  Power and air conditioning;
   o  Water exposures;
   o  Fire prevention and protection;
   o  Media storage, for example, requiring the storage of backup media
      in a separate location that is physically secure and protected
      from fire, smoke, particle and water damage;
   o  Waste disposal; and
   o  Off-site backup.


4.4.2.  Procedural Controls

   In this subcomponent, requirements for recognizing trusted roles are
   described, together with the responsibilities for each role.
   Examples of trusted roles include system administrators, security
   officers, and system auditors.

   For each task identified, the number of individuals required to
   perform the task (n out m rule if applicable) should be stated for
   each role.  Identification and authentication requirements for each
   role may also be defined.

   This component also includes the separation of duties in terms of the
   roles that cannot be performed by the same individuals.

4.4.3.  Personnel Controls

   This subcomponent addresses the following:

   o  Qualifications, experience, and clearances that personnel must
      have as a condition of filling trusted roles or other important
      roles.  Examples include credentials, job experiences, and
      official government clearances that candidates for these positions
      must have before being hired;
   o  Background checks and clearance procedures that are required in
      connection with the hiring of personnel filling trusted roles or
      perhaps other important roles; such roles may require a check of
      their criminal records, financial records, references, and
      additional clearances that a participant undertakes after a
      decision has been made to hire a particular person;





Ljunggren, et al.      Expires September 24, 2010              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


   o  Training requirements and training procedures for each role
      following the hiring of personnel;
   o  Any retraining period and retraining procedures for each role
      after completion of initial training;
   o  Frequency and sequence for job rotation among various roles;
   o  Sanctions against personnel for unauthorized actions, unauthorized
      use of authority, and unauthorized use of entity systems for the
      purpose of imposing accountability on a participant's personnel;
   o  Controls on personnel that are independent contractors rather than
      employees of the entity; examples include:

      *  Bonding requirements on contract personnel;
      *  Contractual requirements including indemnification for damages
         due to the actions of the contractor personnel;
      *  Auditing and monitoring of contractor personnel; and
      *  Other controls on contracting personnel.

   o  Documentation to be supplied to personnel during initial training,
      retraining, or otherwise.


4.4.4.  Audit Logging Procedures

   This subcomponent is used to describe event logging and audit
   systems, implemented for the purpose of maintaining a secure
   environment.  Elements include the following:

   o  Types of events recorded, such as attempts to access the system,
      and requests made to the system;
   o  Frequency with which audit logs are processed or archived, for
      example, weekly, following an alarm or anomalous event, or when
      ever the audit log is n% full;
   o  Period for which audit logs are kept;
   o  Protection of audit logs:

      *  Who can view audit logs, for example only the audit
         administrator;
      *  Protection against modification of audit logs, for instance a
         requirement that no one may modify or delete the audit records
         or that only an audit administrator may delete an audit file as
         part of rotating the audit file; and
      *  Protection against deletion of audit logs.

   o  Audit log back up procedures;
   o  Whether the audit log accumulation system is internal or external
      to the entity;





Ljunggren, et al.      Expires September 24, 2010              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


   o  Whether the subject who caused an audit event to occur is notified
      of the audit action; and
   o  Vulnerability assessments, for example, where audit data is run
      through a tool that identifies potential attempts to breach the
      security of the system.


4.4.5.  Compromise and Disaster Recovery

   This subcomponent describes requirements relating to notification and
   recovery procedures in the event of compromise or disaster.  Each of
   the following may need to be addressed separately:

   o  Identification or listing of the applicable incident and
      compromise reporting and handling procedures.
   o  The recovery procedures used if computing resources, software,
      and/or data are corrupted or suspected to be corrupted.  These
      procedures describe how a secure environment is re-established,
      whether the Key Signing Key or Zone Signing key requires a roll
      over, how to assess the damage and carry out the root cause
      analysis.
   o  The recovery procedures used if the Key Signing Key or Zone
      Signing Key is compromised.  These procedures describe how a
      secure environment is re- established, how the keys are rolled
      over, how the new Trust Anchor is provided to the users and how
      new zone file is published.
   o  The entity's capabilities to ensure business continuity following
      a natural or other disaster.  Such capabilities may include the
      availability of a disaster recovery site at which operations may
      be recovered.  They may also include procedures for securing its
      facility during the period of time following a natural or other
      disaster and before a secure environment is re-established, either
      at the original site or at a disaster recovery site.  For example,
      procedures to protect against theft of sensitive materials from an
      earthquake-damaged site.


4.4.6.  Entity termination

   This subcomponent describes requirements relating to procedures for
   termination, termination notification and transition of
   responsibilities of a Registry.  The major purpose is to ensure that
   the transition process will be transparent to the relying party and
   will not affect the service.

4.5.  Technical Security Controls

   This component is used to define the security measures taken by the
   Registry to protect its cryptographic keys and activation data (e.g.,
   PINs, passwords, or manually-held key shares).  Secure key management
   is critical to ensure that all secret and private keys and activation
   data are protected and used only by authorized personnel.

   This component also describes other technical security controls used
   by the Registry to perform securely the functions of key generation,
   authentication, registration, auditing, and archiving.  Technical
   controls include life-cycle security controls (including software
   development environment security, trusted software development
   methodology) and operational security controls.

   This component can also be used to define other technical security
   controls on repositories, authoritative name servers or other
   participants where applicable.

4.5.1.  Key Pair Generation and Installation

   Key pair generation and installation need to be considered for the
   Registry.  The following questions potentially need to be answered:

   1.  Who generates the Registry's public, private key pair?
       Furthermore, how is the key generation performed?  Is the key
       generation performed by hardware or software?
   2.  How is the private key installed in all parts of the key
       management system?
   3.  How is the Registry's public key provided securely to potential
       relying parties?
   4.  Who generates the public key parameters, and is the quality of
       the parameters checked during key generation?
   5.  For what purposes may the key be used, or for what purposes
       should usage of the key be restricted?


4.5.2.  Private key protection and Cryptographic Module Engineering
        Controls

   Requirements for private key protection and cryptographic modules
   need to be considered for key generation and creation of signatures.
   The following questions potentially need to be answered:








Ljunggren, et al.      Expires September 24, 2010              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


   1.   What standards, if any, are required for the cryptographic
        module used to generate the keys?  A cryptographic module can be
        composed of hardware, software, firmware, or any combination of
        them.  For example, are the zones signatures required to be
        generated using modules compliant with the US FIPS 140-2?  If
        so, what is the required FIPS 140-2 level of the module?  Are
        there any other engineering or other controls relating to a
        cryptographic module, such as the identification of the
        cryptographic module boundary, input/output, roles and services,
        finite state machine, physical security, software security,
        operating system security, algorithm compliance, electromagnetic
        compatibility, and self tests.
   2.   Is the private key under n out of m multi-person control?  If
        yes, provide n and m (two person control is a special case of n
        out of m, where n = m = 2)?
   3.   Is the private key escrowed?  If so, who is the escrow agent,
        what form is the key escrowed in (examples include plaintext,
        encrypted, split key), and what are the security controls on the
        escrow system?
   4.   Is the private key backed up?  If so, who is the backup agent,
        what form is the key backed up in (examples include plaintext,
        encrypted, split key), and what are the security controls on the
        backup system?
   5.   Is the private key archived?  If so, who is the archival agent,
        what form is the key archived in (examples include plaintext,
        encrypted, split key), and what are the security controls on the
        archival system?
   6.   Under what circumstances, if any, can a private key be
        transferred into or from a cryptographic module?  Who is
        permitted to perform such a transfer operation?  In what form is
        the private key during the transfer (i.e., plaintext, encrypted,
        or split key)?
   7.   How is the private key stored in the module (i.e., plaintext,
        encrypted, or split key)?
   8.   Who can activate (use) the private key?  What actions must be
        performed to activate the private key (e.g., login, power on,
        supply PIN, insert token/key, automatic, etc.)?  Once the key is
        activated, is the key active for an indefinite period, active
        for one time, or active for a defined time period?
   9.   Who can deactivate the private key and how?  Examples of methods
        of deactivating private keys include logging out, turning the
        power off, removing the token/key, automatic deactivation, and
        time expiration.
   10.  Who can destroy the private key and how?  Examples of methods of
        destroying private keys include token surrender, token
        destruction, and overwriting the key.

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


   11.  Provide the capabilities of the cryptographic module in the
        following areas: identification of the cryptographic module
        boundary, input/output, roles and services, finite state
        machine, physical security, software security, operating system
        security, algorithm compliance, electromagnetic compatibility,
        and self tests.  Capability may be expressed through reference
        to compliance with a standard such as U.S. FIPS 140-2,
        associated level, and rating.


4.5.3.  Other Aspects of Key Pair Management

   Other aspects of key management need to be considered for the
   Registry and other participants.  For each of these types of
   entities, the following questions potentially need to be answered:

   1.  Is the public key archived?  If so, who is the archival agent and
       what are the security controls on the archival system?
   2.  What is the operational period of the keys.  What are the usage
       periods, or active lifetimes for the pairs?


4.5.4.  Activation data

   Activation data refers to data values other than whole private keys
   that are required to operate private keys or cryptographic modules
   containing private keys, such as a PIN, passphrase, or portions of a
   private key used in a key-splitting scheme.  Protection of activation
   data prevents unauthorized use of the private key, and potentially
   needs to be considered for the Registry.  Such consideration
   potentially needs to address the entire life-cycle of the activation
   data from generation through archival and destruction.  For each of
   the entity types, all of the questions listed in 4.5.1 through 4.5.3
   potentially need to be answered with respect to activation data
   rather than with respect to keys.

4.5.5.  Computer Security Controls

   This subcomponent is used to describe computer security controls such
   as: use of the trusted computing base concept, discretionary access
   control, labels, mandatory access controls, object re-use, audit,
   identification and authentication, trusted path, security testing,
   and penetration testing.  Product assurance may also be addressed.

   A computer security rating for computer systems may be required.  The
   rating could be based, for example, on the Trusted System Evaluation
   Criteria (TCSEC), Canadian Trusted Products Evaluation Criteria,
   European Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC),



Ljunggren, et al.      Expires September 24, 2010              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


   or the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security
   Evaluation, ISO/IEC 15408:1999.  This subcomponent may also address
   requirements for product evaluation analysis, testing, profiling,
   product certification, and/or product accreditation related activity
   undertaken.

4.5.6.  Network Security Controls

   This subcomponent addresses network security related controls,
   including firewalls.

4.5.7.  Timestamping

   This subcomponent addresses requirements or practices relating to the
   use of timestamps on various data.  It may also discuss whether or
   not the time-stamping application must use a trusted time source.

4.5.8.  Life Cycle Technical Controls

   This subcomponent addresses system development controls and security
   management controls.

   System development controls include development environment security,
   development personnel security, configuration management security
   during product maintenance, software engineering practices, software
   development methodology, modularity, layering, use of failsafe design
   and implementation techniques (e.g., defensive programming) and
   development facility security.

   Security management controls include execution of tools and
   procedures to ensure that the operational systems and networks adhere
   to configured security.  These tools and procedures include checking
   the integrity of the security software, firmware, and hardware to
   ensure their correct operation.

   This subcomponent can also address life-cycle security ratings based,
   for example, on the Trusted Software Development Methodology (TSDM)
   level IV and V, independent life-cycle security controls audit, and
   the Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model (SEI-
   CMM).

4.6.  Zone Signing

   This component covers all aspects of zone signing including, the
   cryptographic specification surrounding the Key Signing Key and Zone
   Signing Key, methodology and signing scheme for key roll-over and the
   actual zone signing.  Child zones and other relying parties may
   depend on the information in this section to understand the expected



Ljunggren, et al.      Expires September 24, 2010              [Page 18]

   data in the signed zone and determine their own behavior.  In
   addition, this section will be used to state the compliance to the
   cryptographic and operational requirements pertaining to zone signing
   if applicable.

4.6.1.  Key lengths and algorithms

   This subcomponent describes the key generation algorithm and the key
   length used to create the Key Signing Key and the Zone Signing Key.

4.6.2.  Authenticated denial of existence

   Authenticated denial of existence refers to the usage of NSEC (RFC
   4034 [RFC4034]), NSEC3 (RFC 5155 [RFC5155]) or any other record
   defined in the future that is used to authenticate the denial of
   existence of the resource record.

4.6.3.  Signature format

   This subcomponent is used to describe the signing method and
   algorithms used for the zone signing.

4.6.4.  Zone signing key roll-over

   This subcomponent explains the Zone signing key roll-over scheme.

4.6.5.  Key signing key roll-over

   This subcomponent addresses the Key signing key roll-over scheme.

4.6.6.  Signature life-time and re-signing frequency

   This subcomponent identifies the life-cycle of the Resource Record
   Signature (RRSIG) record.

4.6.7.  Verification of zone signing key set

   This subsection addresses the controls around the keyset signing
   process performed by the Key Signing Key. The procedures surrounding
   KSK management may be different from those of the ZSK, hence it may
   be necessary to authenticate the data signed by the KSK.

4.6.8.  Verification of resource records

   This subsection addresses the controls around the verification of the
   resource records in order to validate and authenticate the data to be
   signed.

4.6.9.  Resource records time-to-live

   This subcomponent specifies the time-to-live (TTL) for each DNSSEC
   related resource record such as DNSKEY, NSEC/NSEC3, DS and RRSIG.

4.7.  Compliance Audit

   The ideal and the only way to prove the statements in the DNSSEC
   Signing Policy or Practices Statement is to conduct an audit.  This
   component describes the outline of how the audit is conducted at the
   registry.

4.7.1.  Frequency of entity compliance audit

   This subcomponent describes the frequency of the compliance audit.
   An audit could be considered as a health check of the service
   therefore it is ideal to have an audit at least once a year to know
   the current status.

4.7.2.  Identity/qualifications of auditor

   This subcomponent addresses what is the qualifications for the
   auditor.  For instance it may be an auditor from a specific
   association or an auditor that has a certain certifications.

4.7.3.  Auditor's relationship to audited party

   This subcomponent is used to clarify the relationship between the
   auditor and the entity being audited.  This becomes important if
   there is any requirements or guidlines for selection of the auditor.

4.7.4.  Topics covered by audit

   Topics covered by audit refers to the scope of the audit.  Since the
   DNSSEC Signing Policy and Practices Statement is the document to be
   audited against, it is ideal to set the scope to the scope of the
   DPS.  However, the scope may be narrowed down or expanded as needed
   for example in case there is not enough resources to conduct a full
   audit, or some portion is under development and not ready for the
   audit.

4.7.5.  Actions taken as a result of deficiency

   This subcomponent specifies the action taken in order to correct any
   discrepancy.  This could be the remediation process for the audit
   findings or any other action to correct any descrepancy with the
   DNSSEC Signing Policy or Practices Statement.

4.7.6.  Communication of results

4.8.  Legal Matters

   This component covers legal matters.  Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of the
   framework discuss the business issues of fees to be charged for
   various services and the financial responsibility of participants to
   maintain resources for ongoing operations and for paying judgments or
   settlements in response to claims asserted against them.  The
   remaining sections are generally concerned with legal topics.

   With respect to many of the legal subcomponents within this
   component, a DPS drafter may choose to include in the document terms
   and conditions that apply directly to registrants or relying parties.
   For instance, a Registry may set forth limitations of liability that
   apply to registrants and relying parties.  The inclusion of terms and
   conditions is likely to be appropriate where the DPS is itself a
   contract or part of a contract.

   In other cases, however, the DPS is not a contract or part of a
   contract; instead, it is configured so that its terms and conditions
   are applied to the parties by separate documents, which may include
   associated agreements, such as registrar or registrant agreements.
   In that event, a DPS drafter may write a Polict so as to require that
   certain legal terms and conditions appear (or not appear) in such
   associated agreements.  For example, a Signing Policy might include a
   subcomponent stating that a certain limitation of liability term must
   appear in a Registrys registrant agreements.  Another example is a
   Signing Policy that contains a subcomponent prohibiting the use of a
   registrar or registrant agreement containing a limitation upon
   Registry liability inconsistent with the provisions of the Signing
   Policy.  A DPS drafter may use legal subcomponents to disclose that
   certain terms and conditions appear in associated agreements in use
   by the Registry.  A DPS might explain, for instance, that the
   Registry writing it uses an associated registrar or registrant
   agreement that applies a particular provision for limiting liability.

4.8.1.  Fees

   This subcomponent contains any applicable provisions regarding fees
   charged by the Registry for DNSSEC or services related to DNSSEC.

4.8.2.  Financial responsibility

   This subcomponent contains requirements or disclosures relating to
   the resources available to the Registry, and to remain solvent and
   pay damages in the event they are liable to pay a judgment or
   settlement in connection with a claim arising out of such operations.

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


   Such provisions include:

   o  A statement that the participant maintains a certain amount of
      insurance coverage for its liabilities to other participants;
   o  A statement that a participant has access to other resources to
      support operations and pay damages for potential liability, which
      may be couched in terms of a minimum level of assets necessary to
      operate and cover contingencies that might occur, and a right
      under an agreement to an indemnity under certain circumstances;
      and
   o  A statement that a participant has a program that offers first-
      party insurance or warranty protection to other participants in
      connection with their use of the Registry services.


4.8.3.  Confidentiality of business information

   This subcomponent contains provisions relating to the treatment of
   confidential business information.  Specifically, this subcomponent
   addresses:

   o  The scope of what is considered confidential information;
   o  The types of information that are considered to be outside the
      scope of confidential information; and
   o  The responsibilities of participants that receive confidential
      information to secure it from compromise, and refrain from using
      it or disclosing it to third parties.


4.8.4.  Privacy of personal information

   This subcomponent relates to the protection that participants,
   particularly the Registry, may be required to afford to personally
   identifiable private information of registrants and other
   participants.  Specifically, this subcomponent addresses the
   following, to the extent pertinent under applicable law:

   o  The designation and disclosure of the applicable privacy plan that
      applies to a participant's activities, if required by applicable
      law or policy;
   o  Information that is or is not considered private within the
      Registry;
   o  Any responsibility of participants that receive private
      information to secure it, and refrain from using it and from
      disclosing it to third parties;
   o  Any requirements as to notices to, or consent from individuals
      regarding use or disclosure of private information; and

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                   March 2010


   o  Any circumstances under which a participant is entitled or
      required to disclose private information pursuant to judicial,
      administrative process in a private or governmental proceeding, or
      in any legal proceeding.


4.8.5.  Limitations of liability

   This subcomponent can include limitations of liability in a DPS or
   limitations that appear or must appear in an agreement associated
   with the DPS, such as a registrar or registrant agreement.  These
   limitations may fall into one of two categories: limitations on the
   elements of damages recoverable and limitations on the amount of
   damages recoverable, also known as liability caps.  Often, contracts
   contain clauses preventing the recovery of elements of damages such
   as incidental and consequential damages, and sometimes punitive
   damages.  Frequently, contracts contain clauses that limit the
   possible recovery of one party or the other to an amount certain or
   to an amount corresponding to a benchmark, such as the amount a
   vendor was paid under the contract.

4.8.6.  Term and termination

   This subcomponent can include the time period in which a DPS remains
   in force and the circumstances under which the document, portions of
   the document, or its applicability to a particular participant can be
   terminated.  In addition or alternatively, the DPS may include
   requirements that certain term and termination clauses appear in
   agreements, such as registrar or registrant agreements.  In
   particular, such terms can include:

   o  The term of a document or agreement, that is, when the document
      becomes effective and when it expires if it is not terminated
      earlier.
   o  Termination provisions stating circumstances under which the
      document, certain portions of it, or its application to a
      particular participant ceases to remain in effect.
   o  Any consequences of termination of the document.  For example,
      certain provisions of an agreement may survive its termination and
      remain in force.  Examples include acknowledgements of
      intellectual property rights and confidentiality provisions.
      Also, termination may trigger a responsibility of parties to
      return confidential information to the party that disclosed it.

6.  Security Considerations

   The sensitivity of the information protected by DNSSEC on all levels
   in the DNS tree will vary significantly.  There are also not any
   restrictions of what kinds of information that can be protected using
   DNSSEC.  Entities must evaluate their own environment and the chain
   of trust originating from their Trust Anchor, the associated threats
   and vulnerabilities, to determine the level of risk they are willing
   to accept.
