1. Introduction 

   This document presents home control and automation application 
   specific requirements for Routing Over Low power and Lossy 
   networks (ROLL). In a modern home, a high number of wireless 
   devices are used for a wide set of purposes. Examples include 
   actuators (relay, light dimmer, heating valve), sensors (wall 
   switch, water leak, blood pressure) and advanced controllers. 
   Basic home control modules such as wall switches and plug-in 
   modules may be turned into an advanced home automation solution 
   via the use of an IP-enabled application responding to events 
   generated by wall switches, motion sensors, light sensors, rain 
   sensors, and so on. 

   Network nodes may be sensors and actuators at the same time. An 
   example is a wall switch for replacement in existing buildings. 
   The push buttons may generate events for a controller node or for 
   activating other actuator nodes. At the same time, a built-in 
   relay may act as actuator for a controller or other remote 
   sensors. 

   Because ROLL nodes only cover a limited radio range, routing is 
   often required. These devices are usually highly constrained in 
   term of resources such as battery and memory and operate in 
   unstable environments. Persons moving around in a house, opening 
   or closing a door or starting a microwave oven affect the 
   reception of weak radio signals. Reflection and absorption may 
   cause a reliable radio link to turn unreliable for a period of 
   time and then being reusable again, thus the term "lossy". 

   Unlike other categories of PANs, the connected home area is very 
   much consumer-oriented. The implication on network nodes is that 
   devices are very cost sensitive, which leads to resource-
   constrained environments having slow CPUs and small memory 
   footprints. At the same time, nodes have to be physically small 
   which puts a limit to the physical size of the battery; and thus, 
   the battery capacity. As a result, it is common for low-power 
   sensor-style nodes to shut down radio and CPU resources for most 
   of the time. The radio tends to use the same power for listening 
   as for transmitting 

   Section 2 describes a few typical use cases for home automation 
   applications. Section 3 discusses the routing requirements for 
   networks comprising such constrained devices in a home network 
   environment. These requirements may be overlapping requirements 
   derived from other application-specific routing requirements. A 
   full list of requirements documents may be found in the end of the 
   document.

2. Home Automation Applications 

   Home automation applications represent a special segment of 
   networked devices with its unique set of requirements. 
   Historically, such applications used wired networks or power line 
   communication (PLC), but wireless solutions have emerged; allowing 
   existing buildings to be upgraded more easily. 

   To facilitate the requirements discussion in Section 3, this 
   section lists a few typical use cases of home automation 
   applications. New applications are being developed at a high pace 
   and this section does not mean to be exhaustive. Most home 
   automation applications tend to be running some kind of 
   command/response protocol. The command may come from several 
   places. 

2.1. Lighting Application In Action 

   A lamp may be turned on, not only by a wall switch but also by a 
   movement sensor. The wall switch module may itself be a push-
   button sensor and an actuator at the same time. This will often be 
   the case when upgrading existing buildings as existing wiring is 
   not prepared for automation. 

   One event may cause many actuators to be activated at the same 
   time. 
   Using the direct analogy to an electronic car key, a house owner 
   may activate the "leaving home" function from an electronic house 
   key, mobile phone, etc. For the sake of visual impression, all 
   lights should turn off at the same time. At least, it should 
   appear to happen at the same time. A well-known problem in 
   wireless home automation is the "popcorn effect": Lamps are turned 
   on one at a time, at a rate so slow that it is clearly visible.  
    
   Some existing home automation solutions use a clever mix of a 
   "subnet groupcast" message in direct range with no acknowledgement 
   before sending acknowledged singlecast messages to each device. 
   Subnet groupcast, being an application-level feature, is not 
   further discussed in this specification. 

   The controller forms the group and decides which nodes should 
   receive a message. 

2.2. Energy Conservation and Optimizing Energy Consumption 

   In order to save energy, air conditioning, central heating, window 
   shades etc. may be controlled by timers, motion sensors or 
   remotely via internet or cell. Central heating may also be set to 
   a reduced temperature during night time. 


 
 
Brandt                   Expires May 19, 2009                  [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs       November 2008 
    

   The power grid may experience periods where more wind-generated 
   power is produced than is needed. Typically this may happen during 
   night hours.  

   In periods where electricity demands exceed available supply, 
   appliances such as air conditioning, climate control systems, 
   washing machines etc. can be turned off to avoid overloading the 
   power grid. 
   This is known as Demand-Side Management (DSM). 
   Remote control of household appliances is well-suited for this 
   application. 

   The start/stop decision for the appliances can also be regulated 
   by dynamic power pricing information obtained from the electricity 
   utility companies. This method called Demand-Response (DR) works 
   by motivation of users via pricing, bonus points, etc. For 
   example, the washing machine and dish washer may just as well work 
   while power is cheap. The electric car should also charge its 
   batteries on cheap power. 

   In order to achieve effective electricity savings, the energy 
   monitoring application must guarantee that the power consumption 
   of the ROLL devices is much lower than that of the appliance 
   itself. 

   Most of these appliances are mains powered and are thus ideal for 
   providing reliable, always-on routing resources. Battery-powered 
   nodes, by comparison, are constrained routing resources and may 
   only provide reliable routing under some circumstances.  

2.3. Moving a Remote Control Around 

   A remote control is a typical example of a mobile device in a home 
   automation network. An advanced remote control may be used for 
   dimming the light in the dining room while eating and later on, 
   turning up the music while doing the dishes in the kitchen. 
   Reaction must appear to be instant (within a few hundred 
   milliseconds) even when the remote control has moved to a new 
   location. The remote control may be communicating to either a 
   central home automation controller or directly to the lamps and 
   the media center. 

2.4. Adding A New Module To The System 

   Small-size, low-cost modules may have no user interface except for 
   a single button. Thus, an automated inclusion process is needed 
   for controllers to find new modules. Inclusion covers the 
   detection of neighbors and assignment of a unique node ID. 
   Inclusion should be completed within a few seconds. 


 
 
Brandt                   Expires May 19, 2009                  [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs       November 2008 
    

   If assignment of unique addresses is performed by a central 
   controller, it must be possible to route the inclusion request 
   from the joining node to the central controller before the joining 
   node has been included in the network. 

2.5. Controlling Battery Operated Window Shades 

   In consumer premises, window shades are often battery-powered as 
   there is no access to mains power over the windows. For battery 
   conservation purposes, such an actuator node is sleeping most of 
   the time. A controller sending commands to a sleeping actuator 
   node via ROLL devices will have no problems delivering the packet 
   to the nearest powered router, but that router may experience a 
   delay until the next wake-up time before the command can be 
   delivered. 

2.6. Remote Video Surveillance 

   Remote video surveillance is a fairly classic application for Home 
   networking providing the ability for the end user to get a video 
   stream from a Web Cam reached via the Internet. The video stream 
   may be triggered by the end-user after receiving an alarm from a 
   sensor (movement or smoke detector) or the user simply wants to 
   check the home status via video. 
   Note that in the former case, more than likely, there will be a 
   form of inter-device communication: Upon detecting some movement 
   in the home, the movement sensor may send a request to the light 
   controller to turn on the lights, to the Web Cam to start a video 
   stream that would then be directed to the end user's cell phone or 
   Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) via the Internet. 
   In contrast to other applications, e.g. industrial sensors, where 
   data would mainly be originated by sensor to a sink and vice 
   versa, this scenario implicates a direct inter-device 
   communication between ROLL devices. 

2.7. Healthcare 

   By adding communication capability to devices, patients and 
   elderly citizens may be able to do simple measurements at home. 
   Thanks to online devices, a doctor can keep an eye on the 
   patient's health and receive warnings if a new trend is discovered 
   by automated filters.  

   Fine-grained daily measurements presented in proper ways may allow 
   the doctor to establish a more precise diagnosis. 

   Such applications may be realized as wearable products which 
   frequently do a measurement and automatically deliver the result 
   to a data sink locally or over the Internet.

   Applications falling in this category are referred to as at-home 
   health reporting. Whether measurements are done in a fixed 
   interval or if they are manually activated, they leave all 
   processing to the receiving data sink. 

   A more active category of applications may send an alarm if some 
   alarm condition is triggered. This category of applications is 
   referred to as at-home health monitoring. Measurements are 
   interpreted in the device and may cause reporting of an event if 
   an alarm is triggered. 

   Many implementations may overlap both categories. 

2.7.1. At-home Health Reporting 

   Applications might include: 

   o  Temperature 
   o  Weight 
   o  Blood pressure 
   o  Insulin level 

   Measurements may be stored for long term statistics. At the same 
   time, a critically high blood pressure may cause the generation of 
   an alarm report. Refer to 2.7.2.  

   To avoid a high number of request messages, nodes may be 
   configured to autonomously do a measurement and send a report in 
   intervals. 

2.7.2. At-home Health Monitoring 

   An alarm event may become active e.g. if the measured blood 
   pressure exceeds a threshold or if a person falls to the ground. 
   Alarm conditions must be reported with the highest priority and 
   timeliness. 

   Applications might include: 

   o  Temperature 
   o  Weight 
   o  Blood pressure 
   o  Insulin level 
   o  Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
   o  Position tracker 

2.8. Alarm Systems 

   A home security alarm system is comprised of various sensors 
   (vibration, fire or carbon monoxide, door/window, glass-break, 
   presence, panic button, etc.).

Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs       November 2008 
    

   Some smoke alarms are battery powered and at the same time mounted 
   in a high place. Battery-powered safety devices should only be 
   used for routing if no other alternatives exist to avoid draining 
   the battery. A smoke alarm with a drained battery does not provide 
   a lot of safety. Also, it may be inconvenient to exchange battery 
   in a smoke alarm.  

   Alarm system applications may have both a synchronous and an 
   asynchronous behavior; i.e. they may be periodically queried by a 
   central control application (e.g. for a periodical refreshment of 
   the network state), or send a message to the control application 
   on their own initiative. 

   When a node (or a group of nodes) identifies a risk situation 
   (e.g. intrusion, smoke, fire), it sends an alarm message to a 
   central controller that could autonomously forward it via Internet 
   or interact with other network nodes (e.g. try to obtain more 
   detailed information or ask other nodes close to the alarm event). 

   Finally, routing via battery-powered nodes may be very slow if the 
   nodes are sleeping most of the time (they could appear 
   unresponsive to the alarm detection). To ensure fast message 
   delivery and avoid battery drain, routing should be avoided via 
   sleeping devices. 

3. Unique Routing Requirements of Home Automation Applications 

   Home automation applications have a number of specific routing 
   requirements related to the set of home networking applications 
   and the perceived operation of the system. 

   The relations of use cases to requirements are outlined in the 
   table below:

3.1. Constraint-based Routing 

   For convenience and low operational costs, power consumption of 
   consumer products must be kept at a very low level to achieve a 
   long battery lifetime. One implication of this fact is that Random 
   Access Memory (RAM) is limited and it may even be powered down; 
   leaving only a few 100 bytes of RAM alive during the sleep phase. 

   The use of battery powered devices reduces installation costs and 
   does enable installation of devices even where main power lines 
   are not available. On the other hand, in order to be cost 
   effective and efficient, the devices have to maximize the sleep 
   phase with a duty cycle lower than 1%. 

   Some devices only wake up in response to an event, e.g. a push 
   button. 

   Simple battery-powered nodes such as movement sensors on garage 
   doors and rain sensors may not be able to assist in routing. 
   Depending on the node type, the node never listens at all, listens 
   rarely or makes contact on demand to a pre-configured target node.

   Attempting to communicate to such nodes may at best require long 
   time before getting a response. 

   Other battery-powered nodes may have the capability to participate 
   in routing. The routing protocol SHOULD route via mains-powered 
   nodes if possible. 

   The routing protocol MUST support constraint-based routing taking 
   into account node properties (CPU, memory, level of energy, sleep 
   intervals, safety/convenience of changing battery). 

3.2. Support of Mobility 

   In a home environment, although the majority of devices are fixed 
   devices, there is still a variety of mobile devices: for example a 
   multi-purpose remote control is likely to move. Another example of 
   mobile devices is wearable healthcare devices. 

   While healthcare devices delivering measurement results can 
   tolerate route discovery times measured in seconds, a remote 
   control appears unresponsive if using more than 0.5 seconds to 
   e.g. pause the music. 

   While, in theory, all battery-powered devices and mains-powered 
   plug-in modules may be moved, the predominant case is that the 
   sending node has moved while the rest of the network has not 
   changed. 

   The routing protocol MUST provide mobility with convergence time 
   below 0.5 second if only the sender has moved. 

   A non-responsive node can either be caused by 1) a failure in the 
   node, 2) a failed link on the path to the node or 3) a moved node. 
   In the first two cases, the node can be expected to reappear at 
   roughly the same location in the network, whereas it can return 
   anywhere in the network in the latter case. 

3.3. Sleeping Nodes 

   Sleeping nodes may appear to be non-responsive. The routing 
   protocol MUST take into account the delivery time to a sleeping 
   target node. 

   The wake-up interval of a sleeping node MUST be less than one 
   second. 

3.4. Healthcare Routing 

   Because most health care applications may run on battery, this 
   leads to specific requirements for the routing protocol. Most 
   health care applications may also be portable and therefore need

   to locate a new neighbor router on a frequent basis. 
   Not being powered most of the time, the nodes should not be used 
   as routing nodes. However, battery-powered nodes may be involved 
   in routing. Examples include cases where a person falls during a 
   power blackout. In that case it may be that no mains-powered 
   routers are available for forwarding the alarm message to a 
   (battery-backed) internet gateway located out of direct range. 

   Delivery of measurement data has a more relaxed requirement for 
   route discovery time compared to a remote control. On the other 
   hand, it is critical that a "person fell" alarm is actually 
   delivered. 

3.5. Scalability 

   Looking at the number of wall switches, power outlets, sensors of 
   various nature, video equipment and so on in a modern house, it 
   seems quite realistic that hundreds of low power devices may form 
   a home automation network in a fully populated "smart" home. 
   Moving towards professional building automation, the number of 
   such devices may be in the order of several thousands. 

   The routing protocol MUST support 250 devices in the network. 

3.6. Convergence Time 

   A wireless home automation network is subject to various 
   instabilities due to signal strength variation, moving persons and 
   the like. Furthermore, as the number of devices increases, the 
   probability of a node failure also increases.  

   Measured from the transmission of a packet, the following 
   convergence time requirements apply. 

   The routing protocol MUST converge within 0.5 second if no nodes 
   have moved. 

   The routing protocol MUST converge within 2 seconds if the 
   destination node of the packet has moved. 

   In both cases, "converge" means "the originator node has received 
   a response from the destination node". 

3.7. Manageability 

   The ability of the home network to support auto-configuration is 
   of the utmost importance. Indeed, most end users will not have the 
   expertise and the skills to perform advanced configuration and 
   troubleshooting. Thus the routing protocol designed for home 
   automation networks MUST provide a set of features including zero-
   configuration of the routing protocol for a new node to be added

Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs       November 2008 
    

   to the network. From a routing perspective, zero-configuration 
   means that a node can obtain an address and join the network on 
   its own, without human intervention. 

3.8. Stability 

   The routing protocol MUST support the ability to isolate a 
   misbehaving node thus preserving the correct operation of the 
   overall network. 

4. Traffic Pattern 

   Depending on the design philosophy of the home network, wall 
   switches may be configured to directly control individual lamps or 
   alternatively, all wall switches send control commands to a 
   central lighting control computer which again sends out control 
   commands to relevant devices. 

   In a distributed system, the traffic tends to be multipoint-to-
   multipoint. In a centralized system, it is a mix of multipoint-to-
   point and point-to-multipoint. 

   Wall switches only generate traffic when activated, which 
   typically happens from a one to tens of times per hour.  

   Remote controls have a similar transmit pattern to wall switches, 
   but are activated more frequently. 

   Temperature/air pressure/rain sensors send frames when queried by 
   the user or can be preconfigured to send measurements at fixed 
   intervals (typically minutes). Motion sensors typically send a 
   frame when motion is first detected and another frame when an idle 
   period with no movement has elapsed. The highest transmission 
   frequency depends on the idle period used in the sensor. 
   Sometimes, a timer will trigger a frame transmission when an 
   extended period without status change has elapsed. 

   All frames sent in the above examples are quite short, typically 
   less than 5 bytes of payload. Lost frames and interference from 
   other transmitters may lead to retransmissions. In all cases, 
   acknowledgment frames with a size of a few bytes are used.

6. Security Considerations 

   Implementing security mechanisms in ROLL network devices may 
   degrade energy efficiency and increase cost. 

   The routing protocol chosen for ROLL MUST allow for low-power, 
   low-cost network devices with limited security needs. 

   Protection against unintentional inclusion in neighboring networks 
   MUST be provided.
