    A URI Template is a compact sequence of characters
    for describing a range of Uniform Resource Identifiers
    through variable expansion.
    This specification defines the URI Template
    syntax and the process for expanding a URI Template into a
    URI reference, along with guidelines for the
    use of URI Templates on the Internet.

     A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) <xref target="RFC3986"/>
     is often used to identify a specific resource within a common
     space of similar resources. For example, personal web spaces
     are often delegated using a common pattern, such as
    </t>
    <figure><artwork>
  http://example.com/~fred/
  http://example.com/~mark/
    </artwork></figure>
    <t>
     or a set of dictionary entries might be grouped in a hierarchy
     by the first letter of the term, as in
    </t>
    <figure><artwork>
  http://example.com/dictionary/c/cat
  http://example.com/dictionary/d/dog
    </artwork></figure>
    <t>
     or a service interface might be invoked with various user input
     in a common pattern, as in
    </t>
    <figure><artwork>
  http://example.com/search?q=cat&amp;lang=en
  http://example.com/search?q=dog&amp;lang=fr
    </artwork></figure>
    <t>
     URI Templates provide a mechanism for abstracting a space of
     resource identifiers such that the variable parts can be easily
     identified and described.  URI templates can have many uses,
     including discovery of available services, configuring resource
     mappings, defining computed links, specifying interfaces, and
     other forms of programmatic interaction with resources.
     For example, the above resources could be described by the
     following URI templates:
    </t>
    <figure><artwork>
  http://example.com/~{username}/
  http://example.com/dictionary/{term:1}/{term}
  http://example.com/search{?q,lang}
    </artwork></figure>
    <t>
     We define the following terms:
     <list style="symbols">
      <t>expression -
         The text between '{' and '}', including the enclosing braces,
         as defined in <xref target="syntax"/>.</t>
      <t>expansion -
         The string result obtained from a template expression after
         processing it according to its expression type, list of variable
         names, and value modifiers, as defined in <xref target="expansion"/>.</t>
      <t>template processor -
         A program or library that, given a URI Template and a set of
         variables with values, transforms the template string into a
         URI-reference by parsing the template for expressions and
         substituting each one with its corresponding expansion.</t>
      </list>
     </t>
    <t>
     A URI Template provides both a structural description of a URI
     space and, when variable values are provided, a simple instruction
     on how to construct a URI corresponding to those values.
     A URI Template is transformed into a URI-reference by replacing each
     delimited expression with its value as defined by the
     expression type and the values of variables named within the
     expression.  The expression types range from simple string
     expansion to multiple key=value lists.  The expansions
     are based on the URI generic syntax, allowing an implementation
     to process any URI Template without knowing the scheme-specific
     requirements of every possible resulting URI.
    </t>
    <t>
     For example, the following URI Template includes a
     form-style parameter expression, as indicated by the "?" operator
     appearing before the variable names.
    </t>
    <figure><artwork>
  http://www.example.com/foo{?query,number}
    </artwork></figure>
    <t>
     Each template expression describes, in a machine-readable manner,
     how a URI is to be constructed.  In this example,
     the expansion process for templates beginning with the
     question-mark ("?") operator follows the same pattern
     as form-style interfaces on the World Wide Web.
    </t>
    <figure><artwork>
  http://www.example.com/foo{?query,number}
                            \_____________/
                               |
                               |
          For each defined variable in [ 'query', 'number' ],
          substitute "?" if it is the first substitution or "&amp;"
          thereafter, followed by the variable name, '=', and the
          variable's value.
    </artwork></figure>
    <t>
     If the variables have the values
    </t>
    <figure><artwork>
  query  := "mycelium"
  number := 100
    </artwork></figure>
    <t>
     then the expansion of the above URI Template is
    </t>
    <figure><artwork>
  http://www.example.com/foo?query=mycelium&amp;number=100
    </artwork></figure>
    <t>
     Alternatively, if 'query' is undefined, then the expansion
     would be
    </t>
    <figure><artwork>
  http://www.example.com/foo?number=100
    </artwork></figure>
    <t>
     or if both variables are undefined, then it would be
    </t>
    <figure><artwork>
  http://www.example.com/foo
    </artwork></figure>
    <t>
     A URI Template may be provided in absolute form, as in the examples
     above, or in relative form.  A template MUST be expanded before the
     resulting reference can be resolved from relative to absolute form.
    </t>
    <t>
     Although the URI syntax is used for the result, the template
     string is allowed to contain the broader set of characters
     that can be found in IRI references <xref target="RFC3987"/>.
     A URI Template is therefore also an IRI template, and the result
     of template processing can be rendered as an IRI by transforming
     each of the pct-encoded sequences to their corresponding Unicode
     character if that character is not in the reserved set.
    </t>
   </section>

   <section title="Levels and Expression Types" anchor="types">
    <t>
     URI Templates are similar to a macro language with a fixed set of
     macro definitions: the expression type determines the expansion
     process.  The default expression type is simple string expansion, wherein
     a single named variable is replaced by its value as a string after UTF-8
     encoding the characters and then pct-encoding any octets that are
     not in the unreserved set.
    </t>
    <t>     
     Since most template processors implemented prior to this specification
     have only implemented the default expression type, we refer to these as
     Level 1 templates.

     Finally, Level 4 templates add the ability to specify value modifiers
     as a suffix to the variable name.  The prefix modifier (":") indicates
     that only a limited number of characters from the beginning of the
     value are used by the expansion.  The explode ("*") modifier tells
     the expansion process to treat the value as a multivalued structure ---
     a list of values or key=value pairs -- rather than as a single string.

   <section title="Design Considerations" anchor="design">
    <t>
     Mechanisms similar to URI Templates have been defined within
     several specifications, including WSDL, WADL and OpenSearch.
     This specification extends and formally defines the syntax so
     that URI Templates can be used consistently across multiple
     Internet applications and within Internet message fields,
     while at the same time retaining compatibility with those
     earlier definitions.
    </t>
    <t>
     The URI Template syntax has been designed to carefully balance
     the need for a powerful expansion mechanism with the need for
     ease of implementation. The syntax is designed to be trivial
     to parse while at the same time providing enough flexibility to
     express many common template scenarios.  Implementations are able
     to parse the template and perform the expansions in a single pass.
    </t>
    <t>
     Templates are simple and readable when used with common
     examples because the single-character operators match the URI
     generic syntax delimiters.  The operator's associated delimiter
     (";", "?", "/", and ".") is omitted when none of the listed variables
     are defined.  Likewise, the expansion process for ";"
     (path-style parameters) will omit the "=" when the variable value
     is empty, whereas the process for "?" (form-style parameters)
     will not omit the "=" when the value is empty.  Multiple variables
     and list values have their values joined with "," if there is no
     predefined joining mechanism for the operator.  Only one operator,
     plus ("+"), will substitute unencoded reserved characters found
     inside the variable values; the other operators will pct-encode
     reserved characters found in the variable values prior to expansion.
    </t>
    <t>
     The most common cases for URI spaces can be described with
     Level 1 template expressions.  If we were only concerned with
     URI generation, then the template syntax could be limited to
     just simple variable expansion, since more complex forms could
     be generated by changing the variable values.  However, URI
     Templates have the additional goal of describing the layout of
     identifiers in terms of preexisting data values.  The template
     syntax therefore includes operators that reflect how
     resource identifiers are commonly allocated.  Likewise, since
     prefix substrings are often used to partition large spaces of
     resources, modifiers on variable values provide a way
     to specify both the substring and the full value string
     with a single variable name.
    </t>
   </section>

   <section title="Limitations" anchor="limitations">
    <t>
     Since a URI Template describes a superset of the identifiers,
     there is no implication that every possible expansion for
     each delimited variable expression corresponds to a URI of an
     existing resource.  Our expectation is that an application
     constructing URIs according to the template will be provided
     with an appropriate set of values for the variables being
     substituted and will be able to cope with any errors that might
     occur when the resulting URI is used for name resolution or access.
    </t>
    <t>
     URI Templates are not URIs: they do not identify
     an abstract or physical resource, they are not parsed as URIs,
     and should not be used in places where a URI would be expected
     unless the template expressions will be expanded by a template
     processor prior to use.  Distinct field, element, or attribute
     names should be used to differentiate protocol elements that
     carry a URI Template from those that expect a URI reference.

   <section title='Character Encoding and Unicode Normalization'
            anchor="unicode-normal">
    <t>
     This specification uses the terms "character" and "coded
     character set" in accordance with the definitions provided
     in <xref target="RFC2978"/>, and "character encoding" in
     place of what <xref target="RFC2978"/> refers to as a "charset".
    </t>
    <t>
     The ABNF notation defines its terminal values to be
     non-negative integers (codepoints) that are a superset of the
     US-ASCII coded character set <xref target="ASCII"/>.  This
     specification defines terminal values as codepoints within the
     Unicode coded character set <xref target="UNIV4"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
     In spite of the syntax and template expansion process being defined
     in terms of Unicode codepoints, it should be understood that
     templates occur in practice as a sequence of characters in
     whatever form or encoding is suitable for the context in which
     they occur, whether that be octets embedded in a network protocol
     element or paint applied to the side of a bus.
     This specification does not mandate any particular character encoding
     for mapping between URI Template characters and the octets used to
     store or transmit those characters.
     When a URI Template appears in a protocol element, the character
     encoding is defined by that protocol; without such a definition,
     a URI Template is assumed to be in the same character encoding as
     the surrounding text.  It is only during the process of template
     expansion that a string of characters in a URI Template MUST be
     transformed into its corresponding sequence of normalized
     Unicode codepoints.
    </t>
    <t>
     The Unicode Standard <xref target="UNIV4"/> defines various
     equivalences between sequences of characters for various purposes.
     Unicode Standard Annex #15 <xref target="UTR15"/> defines various
     Normalization Forms for these equivalences, in particular
     Normalization Form KC (NFKC: Compatibility Decomposition followed
     by Canonical Composition).  The normalization form determines how
     to consistently encode the equivalent strings.
    </t>
    <t>
     In theory, all URI processing implementations, including template
     processors, should use the same normalization form for generating
     or handling a URI reference.  In practice, they do not.  However,
     template processors transform the template literals and variable
     values from characters to codepoints, expand the expressions, and
     then transform the resulting codepoints back to characters again.
     In order to promote consistent generation of URI references from
     templates, template processors MUST ensure that the template and
     each variable value is in NFKC when they are transformed to
     a sequence of Unicode codepoints.  The final step of template
     processing will encode the expanded sequence of Unicode
     codepoints, which should still be in NFKC, as UTF-8
     <xref target="RFC3629"/> and then further pct-encode any octets
     within the UTF-8 string that are not allowed in a URI.
    </t>
   </section>
  </section>

  <section title="Syntax" anchor="syntax">
   <t>
    A URI Template is a string of printable Unicode characters
    that contains zero or more embedded variable expressions, each
    expression being delimited by a matching pair of braces ('{', '}').
   </t>
   <figure><artwork type="abnf">
  URI-Template  = *( literals / expression )
   </artwork></figure>
   <t>
    Although templates (and template processor implementations) are
    described above in terms of four gradual levels, we define the
    URI-Template syntax in terms of the ABNF for Level 4.  A template
    processor limited to lower level templates MAY exclude the ABNF
    rules applicable only to higher levels.  However, it is RECOMMENDED
    that all parsers implement the full syntax such that unsupported
    levels can be properly identified as such to the end user.
   </t>
   <t>
    Each character in a URI Template MUST be transcoded to an NFKC
    Unicode codepoint prior to evaluation.  If a character sequence
    in the template consists of pct-encoded triplets corresponding
    to a valid sequence of octets in UTF-8 that represent a character
    not in the reserved set, then the triplets MUST be replaced with
    their corresponding Unicode codepoint.  In other words, pct-encoded
    UTF-8 found within the template is decoded prior to further processing
    unless the corresponding character is in the reserved set.
   </t>

   <section title="Literals" anchor="literals">
    <t>
     The characters outside of expressions in a URI Template string
     are intended to be translated literally to the URI-reference.

    <t>
     A sequence of pct-encoded literals that corresponds to a UTF-8
     encoded character that is not within the reserved set will be
     transcoded during template processing, as describe above.  If
     such a character is not in the unreserved set, it will be
     re-pct-encoded during the final step of template processing.
     Unreserved characters will therefore be normalized to their
     unencoded form as a side-effect of template processing.
    </t>
   </section>

   <section title="Expressions" anchor="expressions">
    <t>
     Template expressions are the parameterized parts of a URI Template.
     Each expression contains an optional operator, which defines the
     expression type and its corresponding expansion process, followed by a
     comma-separated list of variable specifiers (variable names and
     optional value modifiers).  If no operator is provided, the expression
     defaults to simple variable expansion of unreserved values.

     The operator characters have been chosen to reflect each of their roles
     as reserved characters in the URI generic syntax.  The operators defined
     by this specification include:
     plus ("+") for substituting values that may contain reserved characters;
     dot (".") for substituting values as a sequence of name labels prefixed
     by ".";
     slash ("/") for substituting values as a sequence of path segments

    <t>
     The operator characters comma (","), exclamation ("!"), and at-sign ("@")
     are reserved for future extensions.  A processor that unexpectedly
     encounters such an extension operator SHOULD pass the expression
     through unexpanded and MAY also indicate a warning to the invoking
     application.
    </t>
    <t>
     The expression syntax specifically excludes use of the dollar ("$")
     and parentheses ["(" and ")"] characters so that they remain

   <section title="Variables" anchor="variables">
    <t>
     After the operator (if any), each expression contains a list of
     one or more comma-separated variable specifiers (varspec).
     The variable names serve multiple purposes: documentation for
     what kinds of values are expected, identifiers for associating
     values within a template processor, and the string to use
     for each key on key=value expansions.

     An expression MAY reference variables that are unknown
     to the template processor or whose value is set to a special
     "undefined" value, such as undef or null.  Such undefined
     variables are given special treatment by the expansion process.
    </t>
    <t>
     A variable value that is a string of length zero is not considered
     undefined; it has the defined value of an empty string.
    </t>
    <t>
     A variable may have a composite or structured value, such as a
     list of values, an associative array of (key, value) pairs, or
     a structure of components defined by some separate schema.
     Such value types are not directly indicated by the template
     syntax, but do have an impact on the expansion process.  A
     composite or structured value with zero member values is
     considered undefined.
    </t>
    <t>
     If a variable appears more than once in an expression or
     within multiple expressions of a URI Template, the value of
     that variable MUST remain static throughout the expansion

     purpose of calculating each expansion).

   <section title="Value Modifiers" anchor="modifiers">
    <t>
     Each of the variables in a Level 4 template expression can have
     a modifier indicating either that its expansion is limited to a
     prefix of the variable's value string or that its expansion is
     exploded into components based on an external type or schema
     associated with that variable.

    <section title="Prefix Values" anchor="prefix-values">
     <t>
      A prefix modifier indicates that the variable expansion is limited
      to a prefix of the variable's value string.  Prefix modifiers are
      often used to partition an identifier space hierarchically, as is
      common in reference indices and hash-based storage.  It also serves
      to limit the expanded value to a maximum number of characters.

  prefix        =  ":" offset
  max-length    =  %x31-39 *DIGIT   ; positive integer

     <t>
      The max-length is a positive integer that refers to a maximum number
      of characters from the beginning of the variable's value as a
      Unicode string.
      Note that this numbering is in characters, not octets, in order to
      avoid splitting between the octets of a multi-octet UTF-8 encoded
      character or within a pct-encoded triplet.
      If the max-length is greater than the length of the variable's
      value, then the entire value string is used.

      An explode modifier ("*") indicates that the
      variable represents a composite value that may be substituted
      in full or partial forms, depending on the variable's type or
      schema.  Since URI Templates do not contain an indication of
      type or schema, this is assumed to be determined by context.
      An example context is a mark-up element or header field that
      contains one attribute that is a template and one or more other
      attributes that define the schema applicable to variables found
      in the template.  Likewise, a typed programming language might
      differentiate variables as strings, lists, associative arrays,
      or structures.

     <figure><artwork type="abnf">
  explode       =  "*"

     <t>
      Explode modifiers improve brevity in the URI Template syntax.
      For example, a resource that provides a geographic map for a
      given street address might accept a hundred permutations on
      fields for address input, including partial addresses (e.g.,
      just the city or postal code).  Such a resource could be
      described as a template with each and every address component
      listed in order, or with a far more simple template that makes
      use of an explode modifier, as in
     </t>
     <figure><artwork>
   /mapper{?address*}
     </artwork></figure>
     <t>
      along with some context that defines what the variable named
      "address" can include, such as by reference to some other
      standard for addressing (e.g., UPU S42 or AS/NZS 4819:2003).
      A recipient aware of the schema can then provide appropriate
      expansions, such as:
     </t>
     <figure><artwork>
   /mapper?city=Newport%20Beach&amp;state=CA
     </artwork></figure>
     <t>
      If an explode modifier is present, the expansion process for that
      variable, as defined in <xref target="expansion"/>, is dependent on
      both the operator being used and the type or schema of the value
      being substituted.

   <section title="Value Defaults" anchor="defaults">
    <t>
     Each of the variables in Level 2 (and above) templates may also
     be supplied with a default value to be used when a template processor
     determines that variable to be undefined. The default value is
     limited to unreserved characters, the equal sign ("="), and
     pct-encoded triplets, since the default is provided in the exact
     form that it would appear in the expanded URI reference.
     The default is not affected by any variable modifiers, since we
     assume that the default string provided in the expression already
     reflects the desired value.

  <section title="Expansion" anchor="expansion">
   <t>
    The process of URI Template expansion is to scan the template
    string from beginning to end, copying literal characters as-is
    and replacing each expression with the result of applying the
    expression's operator to the value of each variable named in
    the expression.
   </t>
   <t>
    Each variable value MUST be formed as a sequence of NFKC Unicode
    codepoints prior to template expansion.  A value is assumed to be
    raw data that might need to be encoded by the template processor
    during expansion, depending on the expression type.
   </t>
   <t>
    If a template processor encounters an error outside of an expression,
    such as a character sequence that does not match the &lt;URI-Template&gt;
    grammar, then processing of the template SHOULD cease, the URI-reference
    result SHOULD be undefined, and the location and type of error SHOULD be
    indicated to the invoking application.  If an error is encountered inside
    an expression, such as an operator or value modifier that it does not
    recognize or cannot support, then the expression SHOULD be copied to
    the result unexpanded, processing of the remainder of the template SHOULD
    continue, and the location and type of error SHOULD be indicated to
    the invoking application.
   </t>

   <section title='Literal Expansion' anchor="literal-expansion">
    <t>
     If the literal character is allowed anywhere in the URI
     syntax (unreserved / reserved), then it is copied directly
     to the result string.  Otherwise, the pct-encoded equivalent
     of the literal character is copied to the result string by
     encoding the character in UTF-8 (a sequence of octets) and
     then encoding each octet as a pct-encoded triplet.
    </t>
   </section>

   <section title='Expression Expansion' anchor="expression-expansion">
    <t>
     Each expression is indicated by an opening brace ("{") character
     and continues until the next closing brace ("}").  The expression
     is expanded by determining the expression type and then following
     that type's expansion process for each comma-separated varspec
     in the expression.  Level 1 templates are limited to the default
     operator (simple string value expansion) and a single variable
     per expression.  Level 2 templates are limited to a single
     varspec per expression.
    </t>
    <t>
     The expression type is determined by looking at the first
     character after the opening brace.  If the character is an
     operator, then remember the expression type associated with
     that operator for later expansion decisions and skip to the
     next character for the varspec list.  If the first character
     is not an operator, then the expression type is simple
     expansion and the first character is the beginning of the
     varspec list.
    </t>

    <section title='Undefined Variable Expansion' anchor="undef-expansion">
     <t>
      Regardless of the expression type, a variable that is undefined has
      no value.  A variable defined as a list or structure of component
      values is considered undefined if the list contains zero members or
      all of the structure's components are undefined.
     </t>
     <t>
      If a default value is provided for an undefined variable, as described
      for Level 2 (and above) templates in <xref target="defaults"/>, then 
      the default string is substituted in its place as the entire expansion
      for that varspec.  If all of the variables in an expression are 
      undefined and no defaults are given, then the expression's expansion
      is the empty string.

    <section title='Simple String Expansion: {var}' anchor="op-simple">

      The default expression type when no operator is given is
      simple string expansion.  For each defined variable in the
      variable-list, modify its value as indicated by the optional
      modifiers (if any), encode the value as UTF-8, pct-encode any
      octets that are not in the unreserved set, and then append
      the encoded value to the result string.  If more than one
      value is appended, separate each value with a comma (",").

      Level 1 templates are limited to single variable expressions

      Simple string expansion in Level 2 templates adds variable
      defaulting, as defined in <xref target="defaults"/>.
      Level 3 templates allow a list of variables.
      Level 4 templates add compound variable types and value modifiers,
      as follows:

     <t>
      For a variable defined as a single value string, the explode
      modifier has no effect.  The prefix modifier limits the
      expansion to the first max-length characters of that single
      value.   If the value contains pct-encoded triplets,
      multibyte UTF-8, or both, care must be taken to avoid
      splitting the value in mid-character: count each Unicode
      codepoint as one character.
     </t>
     <t>
      For a variable defined as a list of values, when no value
      modifier is present or the explode modifier is given, the
      variable's string expansion consists of a concatenation
      of the individual values with each value separated by a
      comma (",").  A prefix modifier has no effect.
     </t>
     <t>
      A variable defined as an associative array is expanded as a list
      of alternating key and value pairs, excluding any keys for which
      the corresponding value is undefined, when no value modifier is
      present.  If the explode modifier is given, then the keys with
      defined values are expanded as "key=value" pairs instead of

      associative array is expanded by appending the (key, value)
      pairs as alternating segments (i.e., "/key/value"), but
      excluding any keys for which the corresponding value is
      undefined.  If the explode modifier is given, then the keys with
      defined values are expanded as "/key=value" instead of
      "/key/value".  A prefix modifier has no effect.

  <section title="Example URI Template Parser" anchor="parser">
   <t>
    Parsing a valid URI Template expression does not require
    building a parser from the given ABNF. Instead, the set of allowed
    characters in each part of URI Template expression has been
    chosen to avoid complex parsing, and breaking an expression into
    its component parts can be achieved by a series of splits
    of the character string.
   </t>
   <t>
    Here is example Python code that parses a URI Template
    expression and returns the operator, argument, and
    variables as a tuple. The variables are returned
    as a dictionary of variable names mapped to their
    default values. If no default is given then the
    name maps to None.

  <section title="Revision History (to be removed by RFC Editor)" anchor="revisions">
   <t>05 - Introduced levels to differentiate between legacy, partial,
      and full implementations of URI Templates.
      Changed the default indicator to pipe ("|") to allow the defaults
      to contain the equals character and thus remove the need for complex
      defaulting for the different variable types.
      Removed suffix, remainder, and labelled value expansion because
      there didn't seem much interest in them.
      Clarified that templates and values are processed as sequences of
      Unicode codepoints rather than prematurely encoded as UTF-8, since
      that is easier to explain and more consistent with common language
      routines for processing Unicode strings.
      </t>
   <t>04 - Changed the operator syntax to a single character that is
      analogous to its reserved role within the URI generic syntax,
      resulting in templates that are far more readable for the common
      cases. Added value modifiers for prefix and suffix expansion.
      Added explode modifiers to allow expansion of complex variables
      and lists according to (external) variable types or schema.
      Replaced use of "expansion" with "expression", since expansion
      is traditionally used to refer to the result after expanding
      a macro (not the macro itself). Made applicable to any hypertext
      reference string, such that the process for template expansion
      also includes transforming the surrounding string into a proper
      URI-reference rather than assuming it is already in absolute URI form.
      Rewrote the text accordingly.</t>
   <t>03 - Added more examples. Introduced error conditions and defined
      their handling. Changed listjoin to list. Changed -append to -suffix,
      and allowed -prefix and -suffix to accept list variables. Clarified
      the handling of unicode.</t>
   <t>02 - Added operators and came up with coherent
      percent-encoding and reserved character story.
      Added large examples section which is extracted
      and tested against the implementation.
