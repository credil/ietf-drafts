INTERNET DRAFT           The tn3270 URI scheme          December 5, 2010


1.  Introduction

   The tn3270 URI scheme was first mentioned in RFC 1738 [RFC1738].
   Following the creation of the URI scheme registries per RFC 4395
   [RFC4395], it was added to the "Provisional" registry. However there
   are no clear and acceptable specifications so far for this scheme. 

   The generic syntax of URIs is described in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]. URI
   registering procedures are defined in RFC 4395 [RFC4395].

   This document gives a specification of syntax, semantics and use of
   tn3270 URI scheme.

2.  Scheme Definition 

   The tn3270 URI scheme is used to access services that are provided
   via TN3270 Telnet Service - Interactive 3270 emulation session (see
   RFC 1041 [RFC1041] and RFC 2355 [RFC2355] for details). TN3270
   service practices are defined in RFC 1576 [RFC1576]. In fact this is
   Telnet service with special data transfer mode so the form of URI is
   similar to that of telnet one.

   The tn3270 URI takes the following form (given in ABNF, as described
   in RFC 5234 [RFC5234]; core URI rules are defined in Section 3 of RFC
   3986 [RFC3986]):

   tn3270_uri = "tn3270:" "//" authority ["/"]

   The final character "/" can be omitted.

3.  Security Considerations

   Generic security considerations for the usage of URIs are discussed
   in Section 7 of [RFC3986].

   Many security consideration for telnet URI scheme defined in Section
   3 of RFC 4248 [RFC4248] concern tn3270 one as well. 

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to update the registration of tn3270 URI scheme using
   the following registration template:

   URI scheme name: tn3270

   Status: Provisional

   URI scheme syntax: see Section 2

   URI scheme semantics: see Section 2

   URI scheme encoding considerations: generic encoding considerations
   for URI schemes, defined in Section 2 of [RFC3986], concern tn3270
   one as well. Non-ASCII characters are to be treated as defined in RFC
   3987 [RFC3987]

   Protocols that use the scheme: Telnet TN3270 mode (see RFC 1041
   [RFC1041] and RFC 2355 [RFC2355] for details)

   Security considerations: see Section 3
