               Holding the Ongoing Sessions on MIF Hosts
                    draft-cao-mif-ongoing-session-00

Abstract

   This document discusses the problem of holding the ongoing sessions
   on a multi-homed host.  When there is an application running on one
   interface and another interface with a better routing metric is
   enabled, it is desirable to hold the application on the current
   interface and avoid it being terminated and shifted to another
   interface.

1.  Introduction

   Current laptops, personal computers and smart phones typically have
   multiple access network interfaces and are able to connect to them
   simultaneously.  MIF Working Group is chartered to study the problems
   raised by multiple interface hosts connecting to different domains.
   The central problem [MIF-PS] faced by MIF is that the configuration
   objects are usually provided via a node-scoped way while the desired
   behavior is domain-scoped.

   This document discusses the problem of holding the ongoing sessions
   on a multi-homed host.  When there is an application running on one
   interface and another interface with a better routing metric is
   enabled, it is desirable to hold the application on the current
   interface and avoid it being terminated and shifted to another
   interface.

2.  The Problem

   The problem is illustrated in Figure 1.  Suppose the host has two
   interfaces, If-1 and If-2, and If-2 has a better metric than If-1.
   So if both If-1 and If-2 are enabled, the default route on the host
   will be going through If-2.  For example, If-1 is a WiFi interface,
   and If-2 is a wired ethernet interface.

   Suppose the host initially only enables If-1 with IP address
   10.1.1.0/24, and the host has an on-going session with the remote
   server.  This on-going session is routed via Interface-1 and through
   Net-1.  At this time, when this session is still going on, the host
   enables If-2.  Because If-2 has a better metric than If-1, and if
   there is not a specific route on the host towards the remote server,
   the default route on the host will take effect and all outbound
   traffic will be routed via If-2.  Consequently, the on-going session
   will be terminated.  In order to continue communicating with the
   remote server, the host should normally try to re-connect the server
   via If-2.

   If the client application is able to retain the data got from the on-
   going session, the reconnection will take effect.  Otherwise, the
   data got from the previous session will completely be discarded.  It
   is desirable to hold the on-going session on the interface that
   serves it.

                                 +--------+
              +------------------|  Net-1 |------------------+
          If-1|10.1.1.0/24       +--------+                  |
          +-------+                                      +-------+
          | Host  |                                      | Server|
          +-------+                                      +-------+
          If-2|10.1.2.0/24       +--------+                  |
              +------------------| Net-2  |------------------+
                                 +--------+

             Figure 1: Problem of Holding the Ongoing Session

   We have tested this scenario on Windows XP PCs.  The host first only
   enables its WLAN interface and launches a FTP download.  While the
   download session is going on one interface, we turn on the wired
   interface.  The FTP session will be terminated on the WLAN interface
   and switched to the wired interface.
