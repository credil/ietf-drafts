Abstract

   This document describes a new approach to handling user mobility at
   the network layer in the context of Multiprotocol Label Switched
   Networks (MPLS).  This approach does not rely on the existing IP
   mobility management protocols such as Mobile IP, and is instead based
   on the combination of Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) and MPLS.  This
   document proposes to introduce new protocol elements to MP-BGP to
   achieve Mobility Label distribution at the network control plane and
   the optimal packet delivery to the mobile node by the network
   forwarding plane using MPLS.

2.  Introduction

   The requirements to support user mobility range from the physical
   aspects of wireless access networks to the logical aspects of the
   network control and forwarding plane operation.  In the context of
   this work the main requirement for the mobility support architecture
   is to decouple the network layer addressing and the associated
   logical network topology from the ability of the network to optimally
   deliver the packets to the mobile user.  The optimal traffic delivery
   is interpreted as the delivery of packets to the new node location
   following the best (often the shortest in terms of the routing
   protocol metrics) path between the mobile node and the correspondent
   node.

   The issue is that this optimal path cannot be used by the network to
   communicate with the mobile user based on the IP address and routing
   protocols.  This is due to the inability of a conventional IP network
   to react to the mobile user movements by adjusting the routing and
   forwarding information in the network nodes (routers) to reflect the
   new location of the mobile user with respect to the IP topology.

   Thus a method is required to identify the logical location of the
   user in the network topology in such a manner that the traffic
   delivery to the user at a new location follows the optimal path in
   the context of the routing protocol used in the network.  A natural
   fit to provide this method is the MPLS architecture.  MPLS does not
   perform the forwarding of IP traffic based on the IP addresses and
   uses labels instead.  The important point, however, is that MPLS by
   itself cannot solve the mobility problem as ultimately the traffic
   must originate from the source IP address and terminate at the
   destination IP address (which would still be the old home address).
   In order to use MPLS to forward the traffic to the new user location
   along the optimal path the labels must be assigned specifically to
   the mobile node at the new location and distributed to the network
   nodes.  These special labels are referred to as Mobility Labels and
   are associated (bound) to the mobile node IP address.

   This document proposes to use the Mobility Label as a second label in
   the MPLS label stack.  The first label in the stack is the one that
   identifies the LSP (Label Switched Path) between the two Label Edge
   Routers and the second label in the stack can be used to identify the
   IP address of the mobile node and deliver the traffic to it.  The
   assignment and the distribution of the first label in the stack is
   handled by the conventional MPLS architecture elements and protocols
   such as LDP (Label Distribution Protocol [RFC5036]).  It is proposed
   that the assignment and distribution of the second label - the
   Mobility Label - be based on the existing framework of MP-BGP
   (Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol [RFC4760]).  The mobility

   management scheme based on MP-BGP at the control plane level and MPLS
   at the forwarding plane level represents a system in which both the
   control and forwarding processes are integrated to ensure the optimal
   traffic delivery that is not fully achieved in the existing network
   layer mobility management approaches.

2.1.  Architecture Requirements

   Integrated control and forwarding plane - the network update process
   by the Control Plane must result in the optimal traffic delivery by
   the Forwarding Plane.

   Robust and flexible protocol framework - the Mobility Management
   Control Plane Protocol and the associated functions must be placed at
   the intelligent network edges and allow to avoid the need to involve
   all nodes in the network (including the core nodes) in the network
   update process.

   The Mobility Management Control Plane Protocol must allow for
   flexible and seamless introduction of new features and for support
   for Mobile Hosts and Mobile Routers.

   Evolutionary architecture and implementation approach - the Mobility
   Management scheme should be based as much as possible on the existing
   network architectures and protocol framework.  Only minimal changes
   to the operation of mobile nodes should be expected.

   Efficient network responsiveness - the impact on the mobile
   application due to the service disruption caused by the mobile node's
   movements and the associated network update and delivery processes
   should be reasonably minimal.

   Acceptable network scalability and performance - the new requirements
   for Mobility Management functions should not result in decreased
   network scalability and performance.

2.2.  Existing Solutions

2.2.1.  Mobile IP

   Mobile IP [RFC3344] was developed to provide macro mobility
   management for the mobile hosts using IP version 4 (IPv4).  It was
   subsequently extended to support IPv6.  Due to its complete reliance
   on the logical network topology determined by the distribution of the
   IP subnets Mobile IP solves the mobility problem by using the
   following two major techniques: mobile node registration and traffic
   tunneling.  The main entities in Mobile IP are the Mobile Node (MN)
   itself, the Correspondent Node (CN) - the host that is communicating



Berzin & Malis             Expires May 2, 2008                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Mobility Label Based Network          October 2007


   with the MN, the Home Agent (HA) - this is the router that owns the
   original home subnet to which the MN is assigned, the Foreign Agent
   (FA) - this is the router that owns the subnet to which the MN has
   moved (the foreign subnet), and finally the Care-of-Address (CoA) -
   the IP address that belongs to the FA and that is used to represent
   the MN while it is located in the foreign subnet.  The basic mobility
   handling by Mobile IP results in a sub-optimal forwarding path in the
   direction of traffic from the CN to the new location of the MN.  This
   is because the traffic is first sent to the HA and then tunneled to
   the FA/MN.  Although the route optimization scheme exists where the
   mobility bindings are sent by the HA directly to the CN with the CoA
   of the MN for direct traffic forwarding, it requires the CN to i)
   implement the binding processing and ii) use IP tunneling to send
   packets to the MN.

2.2.2.  Mobile IPv6/HMIP/NEMO

   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] provides macro-mobility support for IPv6.  It
   improves Mobile IPv4 by eliminating the need for the FA, use of the
   IPv6 neighbor discovery instead of ARP, use of the IPv6 Link Local
   (LLOC) address instead of CoA.  It also provides basic support for
   mobile routers via NEMO (Network Mobility) [RFC3963] and enables
   hierarchical mobility management (HMIP).  However MIPv6 does not
   provide for the integration of the control and forwarding planes and
   still requires the use of the HA which results in sub-optimal traffic
   routing.  The routing optimization based on the direct binding
   exchange between the CN and the MN resolves the sub-optimal routing
   but introduces the requirement for the return routability procedure
   and the use of a special IPv6 routing header (similar in function to
   IPv4 tunneling) directly on the CN and MN.  In addition, Hierarchical
   MIPv6 requires registrations to multiple entities (MAP - Mobility
   Anchor Point, HA) and supports IPv6 only.

2.2.3.  MPLS Micro-Mobility

   MPLS Micro-Mobility [MM-MPLS] integrates MIP and MPLS traffic
   forwarding to provide a solution in which MIP is used for macro
   mobility management and MPLS is used to support micro-mobility.
   Micro-mobility reflects the mobile host movements that can be handled
   without the re-registration with the MIP HA.  To achieve this, the MN
   registers with a hierarchical set of Label Edge Mobility Agents
   (LEMA).  The LEMA at the top of the hierarchical set is registered
   with the MIP HA as the FA for the MN.  The MIP HA tunnels all packets
   from the CN to the MN to the top level LEMA as in regular MIP.  The
   LEMA then sends packets on the MPLS LSP to the network location of
   the MN using MPLS labels.  As the MN moves to new locations, the
   hand-off procedures are invoked that start with the MN requesting the
   hand-off and the LEMA(s) performing the set of signaling steps



Berzin & Malis             Expires May 2, 2008                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Mobility Label Based Network          October 2007


   resulting in the redirection of the MPLS LSP from the old serving
   LEMA to the new serving LEMA.  If the MN movement results in a
   condition in which the old top level LEMA can no longer serve the MN,
   the MN re-registers with the new hierarchical set of LEMA(s) and the
   top level LEMA is registered as the FA with the Mobile IP HA.
   Although MPLS Micro-Mobility makes use of the MPLS traffic forwarding
   it still is an extension of Mobile IP and therefore does not result
   in the elimination of triangular routing.

2.3.  Protocol Overview

   MP-BGP and its ability to carry the overlay MPLS label information
   [RFC3107] is proposed for the mobility management.  Namely when the
   mobile hosts or routers change their network locations they can
   register with the edge nodes of the MPLS network (LER) and at that
   time assigned Mobility Labels.  The Mobility Labels in turn are
   associated with the IP addresses of mobile hosts or routers thus
   forming the Mobility Bindings.  These Mobility Bindings are then
   encoded in the Multiprotocol BGP Address Family messaging structure
   and are distributed among the rest of the MPLS network LER nodes
   using the MP-BGP protocol.  The Mobility Binding provides an explicit
   association between the overlay MPLS label and a single or multiple
   individual IP addresses of mobile hosts or IP address ranges
   (prefixes) that are served by mobile routers.  The MP-BGP NEXT_HOP
   attribute associated with the BGP UPDATE message [RFC4271] used to
   carry the Mobility Binding provides an implicit association between
   the overlay Mobility Label and the infrastructure MPLS label that is
   in turn associated with the LSP to reach the LER that sourced the
   Mobility Binding.  The MPLS LER capability to provide mobility
   support can be referred to as the Mobility Support Function (MSF)
   (see Section 3).  The MSF includes: a) Mobile Host/Router Discovery,
   Registration and Status Procedures, b) Mobility Label Association and
   de-Association Procedures, c) Integration with MP- BGP and d) Mobile
   Application Priority Indication and Recognition.

2.4.  Architecture Overview

   This mobility architecture is proposed in the context of MPLS
   networks.  As such it is a requirement of this architecture that all
   nodes in the network support MPLS control and forwarding plane
   procedures and in particular it is a further requirement that the
   edge nodes of the MPLS network implement the Mobility Support
   Function described in Section 3.  This architecture does not rely on
   Mobile IP for macro-mobility support.  In other words there is no
   concept of a home network that the mobile node belongs to and
   therefore there is no requirement to register with the Home Agent.
   It is the assumption of this architecture that a mobile host or
   router is always identified as being in the foreign network thus



Berzin & Malis             Expires May 2, 2008                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        Mobility Label Based Network          October 2007


   always requiring mobility support.  In addition, there is no
   requirement for the CoA.

   The simplest way to implement this assumption is to administratively
   allocate a range of IP addresses for all mobile hosts and routers of
   an organization and to implement in the MSF the configurable ability
   to recognize the pre-allocated mobility address ranges.  As such, a
   service provider would assign IP addresses to all of their mobile
   subscribers from a pre-allocated address range.  This range does not
   have to be flat and can be in turn subnetted.  The IPv4 or IPv6
   mobility address pre-allocation scheme allows utilization of this
   mobility management architecture as a separate overlay MPLS service.
   The only requirement related to the LER MSF pre-configuration is the
   static identification of the overall mobility address range in the
   scope of the LER-wide MSF.

   Regardless of the static identification of the overall address range
   allocated to the mobile devices, the individual mobile nodes identify
   themselves dynamically to the MSF.  This capability is especially
   useful when this architecture is applied to provide mobility support
   to both mobile hosts and routers.  Specifically, during the
   registration procedure a mobile node could identify itself as either
   a mobile host or a mobile router.  If it is a mobile router the MSF
   is expected to establish a routing protocol adjacency with the mobile
   router as well as to utilize an extended Mobility Binding structure
   in which multiple IP prefixes served by the mobile router may be sent
   in a single Mobility Binding optionally associated with a single
   Mobility Label.

   The mobile node must always register with the serving MSF and thus be
   associated with the Mobility Label.  This requirement will support
   the ability to implement specific mobility features such as the
   application sensitivity recognition via the processing prioritization
   scheme.

2.4.1.  Node Roles

   From the network architecture perspective the proposed mobility
   solution follows the classical MPLS network architecture with two
   major node classes: LSR and LER also known as P and PE respectively.
   The LER (PE) nodes reside at the edges of the network and perform the
   corresponding edge functions such as the customer interface
   management, label stack imposition/deposition and label information
   distribution for both the infrastructure MPLS transport and the
   overlay MPLS services.  In addition to these edge functions we
   introduce the Mobility Support Function that integrates directly with
   the LER control plane responsible for the overlay MPLS services.  The
   role of the LSR (P) nodes remains exactly the same as in the



Berzin & Malis             Expires May 2, 2008                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        Mobility Label Based Network          October 2007


   classical MPLS architecture - participate in the infrastructure label
   distribution process and switch traffic based on the MPLS labels
   (outer labels) between the LER nodes.  The LSR (P) nodes need not
   implement the MSF.  Other aspects of the architecture include the
   access interface, the interface to other networks and the network
   hierarchy.

2.4.2.  Attachment Options

   The two major access interface options considered here are: Direct
   Attachment of the LER node to the Radio Access Network and Indirect
   Attachment of the LER node to the Radio Access Network.  The terms
   direct and indirect are not used to indicate that the LER node has or
   does not have the integrated wireless radio interface.  The term
   direct is used to reflect that a direct layer 2 path exists between
   the mobile node and the MSF enabled LER either via the integrated
   radio interface or via the wireline grooming network to the wireline
   side of the Radio Access Network Base Stations.  The term Indirect is
   used to reflect that there is no direct layer 2 path between the
   Radio Access Network and the MSF enabled LER node.  The Indirect
   Attachment means that there is another layer 3 device (such as the
   Customer Edge - CE router in the MPLS Architecture terminology)
   between the MSF enabled LER and the Radio Access Network.  The CE
   router in turn connects to the Radio Network via Direct Attachment
   (in the sense of the term defined here) by using the integrated
   wireless interface or by using the wireline grooming network.  The
   reason for establishing these two access options relates to the type
   of service environments that the proposed architecture will most
   likely be applicable to.

   The Direct Attachment option is most suitable for the use case where
   mobility is offered as an overlay service in a service provider's
   mobility enabled MPLS network.  In this case the Mobility Support
   Function may be viewed as one of the functions in the MPLS for Mobile
   Networks Architecture.  An example of such a use case is the Wireless
   Telephone service with data or multimedia capabilities (such as
   EV-DO) in which mobility management is handled by the MSF enabled
   MPLS network.  The mobile nodes may be the wireless telephone sets
   with IPv4 or IPv6 stacks and the corresponding mobility addresses
   assigned by the service provider, communicating via the Radio Access
   Network Base Stations to the MSF enabled LER nodes.  A simple
   registration procedure triggers the assignment of the overlay
   Mobility Labels and the subsequent mobility management by MP-BGP.

   The Indirect Attachment option is most suitable when the mobility
   service is integrated with other overlay MPLS services such as Layer
   3 VPN [RFC4364].  This use case is applicable for the enterprise

   wireless IP telephones, and the enterprise sites connecting to the
   service provider's mobility enabled MPLS network via the CE routers.
   The simplest way to accommodate the presence of the CE routers is to
   implement the MSF function on the CE router and use the MP-BGP and
   Mobility Labels between the CE router and the LER (PE) router in the
   context of the customer specific MPLS VPN.  This also implies the use
   of MPLS and MP-BGP between the CE and PE routers for the delivery of
   traffic to the mobile nodes behind the CE router, but since there
   will be no LSR (P) routers between the MSF enabled CE and the PE
   router there is actually no need for the outer stack MPLS labels and
   therefore no need to integrate the CE routers with the service
   provider's MPLS infrastructure.  The MPLS LER (PE) router will need
   to accept the Mobility Binding information via the use of MP-BGP from
   the CE router within the MPLS VPN and then propagate that information
   into the MPLS network using the L3 VPN MPLS overlay service also
   based on MP-BGP.

   The direct attachment option is shown in Fig.1, where a MSF enabled
   LER node interfaces with multiple Radio Cells or Cell Clusters via
   the L2 network such as Ethernet.  Each Radio Cell Cluster is assigned
   into a L2 Virtual LAN and associated with a L3 subnet that is
   terminated at a logical interface of the LER node.  The logical
   interfaces are controlled by the MSF and the associated set of Radio
   Cells or Clusters forms a Mobility Region.

   In Fig. 2 a similar arrangement is illustrated but in this case there
   is no direct L2 path between the Radio Access Network and the MPLS
   edge.  A CE router provides the MSF and communicates the Mobility
   Binding information by means of MP-BGP to the MPLS LER (PE) router.

2.4.3.  Network Hierarchy

   The distribution of the Mobility Binding information using MP-BGP may
   be achieved by constructing a flat or hierarchical MP-BGP peering
   topology among the participating LER nodes.  The flat peering logical
   structure requires a full mesh of MP-BGP sessions and the
   hierarchical peering structure can make use of the BGP Route
   Reflectors in which some LER nodes are designated as the Route
   Reflectors and establish peering sessions between themselves and all
   other LER supporting MSF (Route-Reflector-Clients).  The BGP Route
   Reflectors capable of supporting MPLS Mobility are referred to as
   Mobility Route Reflectors.  It is important to note that the Mobility
   Route Reflectors need not support the MSF but must be able to
   interpret and relay the MSF related MP-BGP messaging.

2.4.4.  Interface to Other Networks

   The interface to other networks depends on how the mobility is to be
   managed between the interconnecting networks.  If all mobility

   functions are to be managed by a service provider's network (given
   that the network has sufficient coverage) then the interface to other
   networks can be as simple as the peering gateway node that connects
   the service provider's MPLS network to the rest of the world.  In
   this case there is no need to extend the MPLS processing over this
   interface, and since by construction all mobility IP addresses belong
   to the IP address space of the service provider, the general peering
   arrangement to other networks where the IP address range of the
   service provider is advertised out to the Internet will enable the
   communication between the mobile nodes and the outside destinations.
   In case of the mobile node roaming, this may be supported between the
   service provider networks that both implement the customer facing
   Mobility Support Function and the Network-to-Network Interface (NNI)
   that employs the use of MPLS label exchange (including the Mobility
   Labels).

3.  Mobility Support Function

   This section describes the proposed set of functional elements of the
   MPLS LER node capable of providing mobility management services.
   This document refers to these functional elements as a Mobility
   Support Function (MSF).

3.1.  Mobile Node Discovery, Registration and Status

3.1.1.  Discovery Process - IPv4

   As in [RFC3344] the discovery of the MSF by the mobile nodes is based
   on the ICMP Router Discovery [RFC1256] with specific extensions for
   Mobility Label Based Network (MLBN).  The format of the extensions
   used in this proposal also follows the [RFC3344] section 1.9.

   The discovery process should be initiated by a mobile host or router
   by sending the ICMP Router Solicitation message with MLBN MSF
   Discovery Extension and the TTL set to 1.  This ICMP message along
   with the MLBN Extension is referred to as the MSF Discovery message.
   The MSF Discovery message should carry the information about the type
   of the mobile node: Mobile Host or Mobile Router.

   Upon receipt of the MSF Discovery message the MSF LER must respond
   with the ICMP Router Advertisement including the MLBN specific
   Extension.  This message is referred to as the MSF Advertisement.
   The MSF Advertisement will carry different information depending on
   the type of the mobile node and the registration mode.

      Region_ID - An Identifier (1-255) associated with the Regional
      Mobility Route Reflector.  Region_ID=0 must be used for initial
      registrations by mobile nodes.

      Correlation ID - a number used to keep track of the registration
      requests and the corresponding reply message pairs.

   The MSF Advertisement should be sent to the unicast link layer
   address and the unicast IP address of the mobile host or router that
   were used in the MSF Discovery link layer header and the MSF
   Discovery Extension payload respectively.

   Upon receipt of the MSF Advertisement mobile hosts should continue to
   send the MSF Discovery messages with the interval of 1/3 of the
   specified Registration Lifetime.  The MSF should send the MSF
   Advertisements in response to the periodic MSF Discovery messages
   from the mobile hosts using the corresponding Correlation IDs.  If a
   mobile host does not get responses to three MSF Discovery messages
   (serving as the keepalives) the mobile host should initiate a new MSF
   Discovery process using a new Correlation ID.

   If the L flag in the MSF Advertisement is set, and the R flag is not,
   indicating the Lightweight Registration mode (see Section 3.1.3.1),
   the mobile hosts may start sending datagrams to their IP destinations
   using the link layer address of the MSF.  The L and R flags are
   mutually exclusive and cannot be set at the same time.

   If the R flag is set in the MSF Advertisement, indicating that
   explicit registration is required, mobile hosts should transition to
   the Full Registration mode (see Section 3.1.3.1.2).

   The R flag must always be set in the MSF Advertisement if it is in
   reply to the MSF Discovery sent by a mobile router.  Upon receipt of
   the MSF Advertisement a mobile router must transition to the Routing
   Adjacency Establishment mode (see Section 3.1.3.2).

3.1.2.  Discovery Process - IPv6

   The MSF discovery process for IPv6 is identical to the discovery
   process for IPv4 with the exception of the use of IPv6 specific
   Router Solicitation and Advertisement messages based on ICMPv6
   [RFC4443].  These messages are specified in [RFC4861].  As in the
   IPv4 case the Router Solicitation and Advertisement messages carry
   the MLBN extensions and are termed the MSF Discovery and the MSF
   Advertisement respectively.

   Please refer to [RFC4861] for the specification of the remaining
   fields in both of the above messages.

3.1.2.1.  MSF Discovery by Mobile Hosts - IPv6

   The MSF Discovery message format for IPv6 mobile hosts is identical
   to the IPv4 message with the IPv6 Source Address used instead of the
   IPv4 (see Section 3.1.1.1).

3.1.2.2.  MSF Discovery by Mobile Routers - IPv6

   The MSF Discovery message format for IPv6 mobile routers is identical
   to the IPv4 message with the IPv6 Router ID used instead of the IPv4
   (see Section 3.1.1.2).

3.1.2.3.  MSF Advertisement - IPv6

   The MSF Advertisement message format for IPv6 is identical to the
   IPv4 message format (see Section 3.1.1.3).

3.1.3.  Registration and Status - IPv4

3.1.3.1.  Mobile Host Registration - IPv4

3.1.3.1.1.  Lightweight Registration - IPv4

   MLBN eliminates the need for the registrations with the Home Agent
   and Care-of-Addresses.  This makes it possible to implement a
   Lightweight Registration procedure which is simply the completion of
   the MSF Discovery process (Section 3.1.1).  The Lightweight
   Registration is indicated by the presence of the L flag in the MSF
   Advertisement message.  With the Lightweight Registration the MSF
   should allocate the local Mobility Label and create the Mobility
   Binding structure (Section 3.2.2) immediately following the receipt
   of the MSF Discovery message from a mobile host.  The MSF should also

   initiate the network update process (see Section 4) based on the
   selected update mode and the indicated mobile application priority.

   The network update mode selection may be based on the Application
   Service Type Indication (ASTI) from the MSF discovery message sent by
   the mobile host.  ASTI is a 3-bit field that may be used to indicate
   to the MSF what type of service is to be used by the mobile host.
   For example, "Internet Access Only" or "Full Mobile-to-Mobile
   Routing".  This indication can then be mapped to the Network Update
   Mode Code used in the Mobility Binding structure.

3.1.3.1.2.  Full Registration - IPv4

   Full Registration is a registration mode which allows to perform
   additional functions as part of the registration process.  An example
   of such function is the Mobile Host Authentication.  Full
   registration mode is indicated in the MSF Advertisement by setting
   the R flag.

   Full Registration messaging makes use of the UDP port RRR and may
   provide a mechanism for various functional extensions.  Full
   Registration uses two message types:

      Registration Request - Type 1

      Registration Reply - Type 2

   The Registration Message formats are shown below.

      Correlation ID - a number used to keep track of the registration
      requests and the corresponding reply message pairs.

3.1.3.1.3.  Group Registration - IPv4

   Clearly the discovery and registration procedure has a great effect
   on the network responsiveness especially when a mobile host moves
   from one serving MSF to another.  The following enhanced registration
   scheme can be implemented to simplify the registrations resulting
   from the MSF-to-MSF handoff and therefore improve the network
   responsiveness.  We refer to it as the Group Registration.

   The entire MPLS edge network may be divided in groups or regions
   containing the geographically close MSF enabled LER nodes.  Each
   group should be assigned a unique Group ID (1-255).  The mobile host
   will register with a LER node within a group using a Group
   Registration procedure.  The LER node will distribute the
   registration information to the rest of the group members using the
   established MP-BGP peering sessions.  These messages may be coded as
   another type of the NLRI in the Address Family structure.  The size
   of the region should be large enough to ensure a high probability
   that the range of movements of a mobile host will be covered by the
   service area of the group but at the same time not too large to avoid
   a large registration table size shared among the group members.  The
   group members can be identified administratively and preconfigured in
   the MSF serving LER nodes.

Internet-Draft        Mobility Label Based Network          October 2007


   During the initial registration process and as part of the
   registration acknowledgement the serving LER may indicate to the
   mobile host that it is registered to a group and from now on should
   use a group virtual link layer address and a group virtual IP address
   for further communications (the addresses may be communicated in the
   acknowledgement payload).

   The group registration allows to implement the implicit logic by
   which no further registrations are required from the mobile node due
   to its movements once the initial group registration has been
   established.  The group members may also pre-allocate the Mobility
   Labels and have them ready in case the mobile node moves into the
   member's serving area.  Once the mobile node has moved into the
   serving area of the new MSF group member it continues to send packets
   to the group virtual link layer address and the virtual IP address.
   As soon as the packet from the mobile node is received by the group
   member it will forward the packet to its destination and distribute
   the new Mobility Binding to the network.  A mobile host should
   continue to send the MSF Discovery messages destined to the group
   link layer address in order to keep the group registration active.

   The group member that is servicing the mobile host can periodically
   send the registration update messages to the group members in order
   to keep the Mobility Bindings in the standby status.  If a group
   member has not received any keepalives or packets from the mobile
   host in a specified period of time it should silently deactivate its
   local registration entry and release the Mobility Label.  If the
   mobile host happens to be serviced by another group member, this
   member will be sending the registration update messages to the group
   keeping the registration active.  If no group member hears from the
   mobile node, the registration must be removed from the group database
   after a specified time and the associated Mobility Binding may be
   withdrawn from the network by means of the MP-BGP update.

   Group Registration message formats are very similar to the Full
   Registration message formats.  The Group Registrations starts with
   the mobile host sending the MSF Discovery message and the MSF
   replying with the MSF Advertisement having the G flag set, indicating
   that the Group Registration is supported.  After this the mobile host
   must transition to the Group Registration protocol using the same UDP
   port RRR as for the Full Registration.

   Group Registration uses two message types:

      Group Virtual Link Layer Address - a MAC address shared and
      recognized by all MPLS LER interfaces of all MSF's that belong to
      the Registration Group identified by the Group ID.  This address
      may specifically be used to support Group Micro-Mobility (see
      Section 4.3.2).

      Correlation ID - a number used to keep track of the registration
      requests and the corresponding reply message pairs.

      Region_ID - An Identifier (1-255) associated with the Regional
      Mobility Route Reflector.  Region_ID=0 must be used for initial
      registrations by mobile nodes.

   As in the Full Registration case the Group Registration allows to
   perform additional functions as part of the registration process by
   means of using the functional extensions.  An example of such a
   function is the Mobile Host Authentication.

   After the completion of the Group Registration with the initial MSF
   that is part of the Registration Group, the mobile host must send the
   MSF Discovery messages destined to the Group Virtual Link Layer
   Address listing the Group ID and the Group Virtual IP Address.  The
   registration information is communicated among the group members
   using MP-BGP signaling with the specific SAFI value assigned for this
   purpose (see Section 3.2.3).  Any group member receiving the MSF
   Discovery messages from a mobile host for which the group
   registration is active must reply with the MSF Advertisement messages
   to the mobile host.  When a mobile host moves from one group member
   to another it should continue to send packets to its IP destination
   using the Group Virtual Link Layer Address.

3.1.3.2.  Mobile Router Registration - IPv4

   Mobile routers should initiate the registration procedure by sending
   the registration message with the mobile router identification flag
   set and its Router ID (an IP address that belongs to the router)
   specified (see Section 3.1.1.2).

   Upon receipt of this registration information the MSF should initiate
   the establishment of the dynamic routing protocol adjacency with the
   mobile router using protocols such as BGPv4 [RFC4271].  The mobile
   router should advertise to the MSF the IP prefixes it serves using
   the established routing adjacency.

3.1.3.2.1.  Routing Adjacency Establishment

   The MSF should receive the routing protocol update from the mobile
   router and allocate a single Mobility Label to represent all of the

Internet-Draft        Mobility Label Based Network          October 2007


   served prefixes.  This label should then be used in the Mobility
   Binding structure exported to the network by MP-BGP (see Figure 18).
   Optionally, each served IP prefix advertised by the mobile router can
   be associated with a separate Mobility Label.  This can be used to
   provide different mobility processing priority to different IP
   prefixes.

   The mobile router status detection can be based on the state of the
   dynamic routing protocol adjacency maintained by the periodic
   keepalive messaging common to the routing protocols.

3.1.4.  Registration and Status - IPv6

   The registration procedures described for IPv4 in Section 3.1.3 are
   fully extended to IPv6 using the same message formats and the UDP
   port number.  In all messages the IPv4 addresses are replaced with
   their IPv6 equivalents (with the corresponding increase in the
   required field length).

   Thus, for mobile hosts the Lightweight, Full and Group Registration
   modes are supported (see Section 3.1.3.1.1, Section 3.1.3.1.2,
   Section 3.1.3.1.3), and for mobile routers the same IPv4 procedure
   described in Section 3.1.3.2 and modified to include the IPv6
   messages should be supported.

   In addition to the use of the MSF Discovery/Advertisement message as
   keepalives for determining the status of the reachability of the
   serving MSF function, mobile nodes may utilize IPv6 Neighbor
   Unreachability Detection procedures specified in [RFC4861] section
   7.3.

3.2.  Integration with MP-BGP

   In order to integrate the MSF on the LER with the MP-BGP processing,
   a new Address Family must be created.  This Address Family must be
   assigned a new and unique AFI following the Address Family structure
   of MP-BGP.  This Address Family may be referred to as the Mobility
   Address Family.  In fact a number of Mobility Address Families may be
   created to support IPv4/IPv6 unicast/multicast protocols.  In all
   cases the Address Families must use the structure that allows them to
   carry the overlay MPLS label information (a specially designated
   value of SAFI).

3.2.1.  Mobility Address Family

   In order to carry the Mobility Binding information the BGP UPDATE
   message with the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI optional non-
   transitive attributes is used as specified in [RFC4760].

   For the mobility management purposes a set of new Address Family
   Identifiers (AFI) and Subsequent Address Family Identifiers (SAFI)
   are defined.  Specifically the following new AFI values are defined:

      Mobility IPv4 Unicast - AFI X1 SAFI Y1

      Mobility IPv6 Unicast - AFI X2 SAFI Y1

   The MP_REACH_NLRI attribute is used to update the LER nodes with new
   Mobility Binding information.  The structure of the attribute is

   group members using existing MP-BGP peering sessions.  To achieve
   this, the MSF should allow for a configuration capability to identify
   the group membership by assigning a Group ID to the MP-BGP peers that
   belong to the same group.  The same capability should be provided

   within the Mobility Route Reflectors in order to be able to
   successfully update the group members with the mobile node
   registration information.

   The mobile host registration information includes the IP address of
   the mobile host, the Group ID, the priority and the ASTI codes as
   well as the MAC address of the mobile host.  This information is
   encoded in the Address Family structure using the AFI values
   specified in Section 3.2.1 but with a specifically designated value
   of SAFI.  The encoded information is then carried in the

      Correlation ID - a number used to keep track of the registration
      requests and the corresponding reply message pairs.

   The group registration information updates may be sent periodically
   by the group members.  The registration information for multiple
   mobile hosts may be aggregated in a single MP-BGP UPDATE message.
   The mobile host registration information may be explicitly withdrawn
   by the group member that was the last to "hear" from the mobile host.

   If a group member receives the MP-BGP registration information update
   listing a mobile host that has an active local registration entry,
   the local registration information must be silently discarded and the
   corresponding local Mobility Binding deleted.  The local Mobility
   Label should be returned to the local available label pool.

   If a local registration entry for a mobile host has expired, and if a
   mobile host registration information is not found in the incoming
   periodic MP-BGP registration information updates from any of the
   group members, the group member should send the MP-BGP registration
   information update carrying the host's registration information in
   the MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute.  In addition the group member should
   initiate a network update using the MP_UNREACH_NLRI with the encoded

   Mobility Binding for the host in order to withdraw the Mobility
   Binding from the MSF databases of the MPLS LER nodes.

3.2.4.  BGP Capability Advertisement

   The {AFI, SAFI} pairs defined in this document for mobility
   management must be supported by all BGP speakers participating in
   mobility management.  A BGP Capability Advertisement as specified in
   [RFC4760] must be used by the BGP speakers to ensure compatibility.

3.3.  Mobile Application Priority Indication and Recognition

   Given the sensitivity of applications to the network service
   disruption the MSF function should include a mechanism by which an
   application may indicate the level of tolerance to the disruption due
   to the network handling of the handoff process.  This indication may
   be encoded in the registration messaging payload and then
   incorporated into the Mobility Binding protocol structure.  The
   application sensitivity prioritization scheme may be used to control
   the Mobility Binding processing priority during the distribution
   process.  For example a mobile host running a real time interactive
   application may be given a higher processing priority over the mobile
   host running an elastic data transfer application.  The
   prioritization of processing leads to a differential treatment of the
   mobile application at various processing points of the mobile network
   such as the ingress MSF, the intermediate hierarchical route
   processing by MP-BGP Route Reflectors and the egress MSF.

   In addition to the processing priority, the priority indication
   mechanism may be used to implement the network update grouping and
   timing policies in a manner that could decrease the frequency of the
   updates and thus increase the scalability of the network.
   Specifically, the indicated application priorities may be mapped into
   the network update classes where the top priority may get an
   immediate network update and the lower priorities may be organized
   into classes.  For each class the network update process may be
   delayed for a time period that is not expected to result in the
   unreasonable disruption to an application of a given priority level.
   The network updates for any new registration events of the same
   priority level that have occurred during the corresponding delay
   period may be grouped in a single MP-BGP update message.  If a single
   update message cannot carry all of the newly arrived registrations an
   additional update should be created and sent.  The update mode may be
   determined from the Application Service Type Indication communicated
   during the registration.

3.4.  Application Service Type Indication

   Application Service Type Indication (ASTI) is a 3-bit field that may
   be used to indicate to the MSF what type of service is to be used by
   the mobile host.  For example, "Internet Access Only" or "Full
   Mobile-to-Mobile Routing".  This indication may then be mapped to the
   Network Update Type Code used in the Mobility Binding structure.  For
   example, if ASTI code 001 (binary) is used to indicate the "Internet
   Access Only" service, the local MSF may use the Selective Downstream
   Push (see Section 4.1.2) Network Update mode.  In addition the MSF
   may include the corresponding Update Type code in the Mobility
   Binding structure in order to indicate to the Mobility Route
   Reflectors that the Selective Downstream Push is to be used.

4.  Network Update and Hand-off Processing

4.1.  Network Update Modes

   The following four modes for the Mobility Binding Distribution or
   Withdrawal are proposed: i) unsolicited downstream push, ii)
   selective downstream push, iii) predictive downstream push, and iv)
   hierarchical on-demand distribution.

4.1.1.  Unsolicited Downstream Push

   In this mode the originating LER node updates all other MSF enabled
   LER nodes that are directly peered with it.  In case of a
   hierarchical topology the originating LER node sends a MP-BGP update
   with the Mobility Binding information to a Route Reflector which in
   turn updates all of the participating MSF enabled LER Route Reflector
   clients.  Thus the network wide update can only considered to be
   complete if and only if all of the MSF LER nodes are updated.
   Clearly this distribution mode has scalability limitations and may be
   applicable for a relatively small number of the MSF enabled LER
   nodes.  The Update Type Code for this mode is binary 000.

4.1.2.  Selective Downstream Push

   In this mode the Mobility Binding updates are only sent to a select
   set of the MSF enabled LER nodes.  The underlying idea for this mode
   is that it is very likely that the most used destinations from the
   mobile host when it communicates with the Internet are the
   destinations reachable via a finite set of the service provider's
   Internet gateway nodes which are in turn reachable via a finite set
   of the MSF enabled LER nodes.  As such, when a mobile host registers
   with the serving MSF, instead of using the Unsolicited Downstream
   Push to all LER nodes, the Mobility Binding update for this mobile
   host would be sent to a finite set of the LER nodes connected to the
   service provider Internet gateways.  This mode can be used for the
   initial update process and the Unsolicited Downstream Push can be
   used at a later point in time.  The Update Type Code for this mode is
   binary 001.

4.1.3.  Predictive Downstream Push

   In this mode the Mobility Binding updates are sent to those MSF
   enabled LER nodes which are identified as a NEXT_HOP for the FEC (and
   the corresponding LSP) leading to the destination of the packet
   originated by a mobile node.  This mode is based on the fact that if
   the destination FEC exists in the serving MSF LER's routing table,
   and the mobile node sends a packet to the FEC, the LER will perform
   the label imposition (for the infrastructure label) by selecting the

Internet-Draft        Mobility Label Based Network          October 2007


   label corresponding to the FEC NEXT_HOP.  This NEXT_HOP in turn
   identifies the destination MSF enabled LER node to which the Mobility
   Binding update needs to be sent.  The predictive feature of this mode
   comes from the fact that the Mobility Binding update destination is
   predicted as the result of the originating LER's lookup of the
   destination FEC and its NEXT_HOP.  Clearly it is likely that the LER
   node to which the predictive Mobility Binding update is sent may
   receive the reply packet from the mobile node's destination before
   the Mobility Binding for the originating host is received.  In this
   case the LER that is being updated may buffer the reply packet for a
   reasonable period of time to wait for the mobility update.  The
   Update Type Code for this mode is binary 010.

4.1.4.  Hierarchical On-Demand Distribution

   The Mobility Binding update is first sent by a serving MSF LER to a
   set of Mobility Route Reflectors using the Selective Downstream Push.
   Once the Mobility Route Reflectors have been updated, all other LER
   nodes must explicitly request Mobility Labels from the Mobility Route
   Reflectors for packets destined to a mobile node.  The Update Type
   Code for this mode is binary 011.

4.1.4.1.  On-Demand Requests for Mobility Binding Information

   To support the Hierarchical On-Demand Distribution Network Update
   Mode the following explicit Mobility Binding information request
   procedure based on MP-BGP may be used.  When a MPLS LER supporting
   MPLS Mobility receives an IP packet, it first should check if the
   Destination Address listed in the IP header belongs to the overall IP
   address range assigned to the mobility functions and the
   corresponding mobile device fleet.  If the Destination Address falls
   within this range and the matching Mobility Binding is present in the
   LER MSF database, the packet should be encapsulated using the
   appropriate MPLS label stack and forwarded on the LSP toward the LER
   that is listed as the "Origin MP-BGP NEXT_HOP" in the Mobility
   Binding.  If the IP address is outside of the mobility fleet range
   the packet must be treated in accordance with the conventional rules
   based on either the IP or MPLS forwarding tables.

   If the packet falls into the mobility fleet range and no matching
   Mobility Binding entry exists in the MSF database, the LER should
   send an on-demand request for Mobility Binding Information to the
   designated Mobility Route Reflector.  This request is encoded as a
   special type of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute using a specific SAFI
   value and one of the AFI values defined earlier.  The Mobility Route
   Reflector should process the request and return the Mobility Binding
   update to the requesting LER using the NLRI encoding shown in
   Section 3.2.2.

   Specifically the following new SAFI value is defined for the On-

      L.R. Region_ID - ID of the Regional mRR serving the LER from which
      the On-Demand Mobility Binding Information Request for the mobile
      node in question was last received (may be more than one).

4.1.5.  Network Hierarchy Considerations

   The first three update modes are directly applicable for the flat MSF
   LER peering topology and the fourth to the hierarchical peering
   environment.  In the hierarchical peering environment only
   Unsolicited Downstream Push does not require any modifications to the
   Route Reflector operation.  The Selective and Predictive modes
   require that the Route Reflectors perform selective MP-BGP updates
   for the Mobility Bindings distribution.  This can be achieved by a
   modification of the Route Reflector update process where destinations
   of the selective updates indicated by the Update Type Code can be
   derived from the "Target NEXT_HOP" parameter in the Mobility Binding
   structure.  The Hierarchical On-Demand mode requires the Route
   Reflectors to store the Mobility Bindings and respond to the on-
   demand Mobility Binding requests initiated by the client MSF LER
   nodes or other Mobility Route Reflectors.

4.1.6.  Regionalization and Scalability

   To improve the scalability of the network update process the entire
   serving network may be divided into the Registration Regions.  Each
   registration region is served by a Regional Mobility Route Reflector
   (mRR) with the individual MSF LER nodes falling within the region
   serving as the Route Reflector Clients.  Each MSF LER node in turn
   may serve a specific geographic area called a Mobility Region that is
   covered by a given set of Radio Access Networks using Direct or In-
   direct Attachment options.  This type of the regionalized mobility
   signaling infrastructure is referred to as the Mobility Information
   Location System (MILS) and is shown in the figure below.

                                 Figure 22

4.1.6.1.  Mobility Information Location System (MILS)

   The operation of MILS is based on the Hierarchical On-Demand Network
   Update mode and requires the individual MSF LER nodes to only
   directly update their respective Regional Mobility Route Reflectors
   (using the Selective Update).  After the Regional mRR's have been
   updated with the Mobility Binding information, these bindings may be
   explicitly requested by the MSF LER's in the same Registration Region
   or the LER's in other regions via their mRR's.  To facilitate the
   hand-off process a Last Requestor List (LRL) is introduced and
   associated with each Mobility Binding at the Regional mRR level.  The
   LRL is a list of 2-tuples where each 2-tuple consists of the
   Router_ID and Region_ID of the MSF LER nodes that have requested
   Mobility Binding information for a particular mobile node.  The
   logical operation of MILS is described below based on Figure 22.

   1.  Assume that a previously unknown MN initiated a Discovery and

   Registration process in the Mobility Region 11.  Upon successful
   registration MN communicates its IP address to the MSF in LER11 and
   receives the related MSF information including the Region_ID=1.
   (During the registration the newly initialized MN should use
   Region_ID=0).

   2.  LER11 creates a local Mobility Binding for the MN and updates
   mRR1 using the Selective Mode specifying the MN's IP address, It's
   own Router_ID, the Mobility Label and the initial Region_ID=0.  LER11
   stores the received Mobility Binding and associates an empty LRL with
   it.

   3.  Assume that a Correspondent Node (CN) in the Mobility Region 34
   sends a packet to the MN in the Mobility Region 11.  The packet
   reaches LER34.

   4.  LER34 identifies that the packet falls into the mobility address
   range and requests Mobility Binding information from its Regional
   mRR3 using On-Demand Mobility Binding Request (see Figure 20).  LER34
   uses the value of the Region_ID=3 in the request.

   5.  Since mRR3 does not have the Mobility Binding for the MN it
   forwards the requests to both mRR1 and mRR2. mRR1 replies with the
   Mobility Binding and mRR3 forwards the reply to LER34.  Both mRR1 and
   mRR3 associate an LRL with the Mobility Binding listing the LER34
   Router_ID and the Region_ID=3.

   6.  LER34 forwards the packet to the MN using the LSP between LER11
   and LER34 and a stacked Mobility Label extracted from the received
   Mobility Binding.

   7.  Assume that MN now moves into the Mobility Region 22.  It
   initiates a new Discovery and Registration procedure and registers
   with the MSF at LER22 specifying its IP address and the Last
   Region_ID=1.

   8.  LER22 creates a local Mobility Binding for the MN and updates its
   regional mRR2 using Selective Mode and sending the Region_ID=1 along
   with the Mobility Binding.

   9. mRR2 receives the new Mobility Binding and examines the associated
   value of Region_ID.  If it is not equal to 0 then the LRL for this
   binding must be requested from the mRR identified by the Region_ID.
   In this case mRR2 sends the On-Demand request to mRR1 asking for the
   associated LRL created in step 5.

   10. mRR2 receives the LRL={Router_ID=LER34, Region_ID=3} from mRR1
   (see Figure 21) and sends a Mobility Binding update to mRR3 using the

   Selective Downstream Push Mode with the "Target MP-BGP NEXT_HOP" set
   to the LER34 Router_ID.

   11. mRR3 receives the updated Mobility Binding and looks up the
   "Target MP-BGP NEXT_HOP".  In this case it is equal to the LER34
   Router_ID. mRR3 updates LER34 with the new Mobility Binding using
   Selective Downstream Push.  LER34 starts to forward packets to the MN
   using the LSP between LER34 and LER22 (listed as the "Origin MP-BGP
   NEXT_HOP" in the updated Mobility Binding) and the new overlay
   Mobility Label.

4.2.  Hand-off Processing

   The use of the Multi-Protocol BGP for mobility management allows a
   simple basic hand-off processing scheme to be implemented.  In
   particular, when a mobile node detects that it can no longer receive
   the keepalive acknowledgements from the serving MSF it initiates the
   new discovery and registration procedure.  After the successful
   registration the new serving MSF will assign and distribute a new
   Mobility Binding to the rest of the participating LER nodes thus
   replacing the corresponding old Mobility Binding entries in their MSF
   databases.  Once the entries have been replaced by the new Mobility
   Binding the LER nodes will automatically forward the packets destined
   for the mobile node onto the new LSPs connecting to the mobile node's
   new serving MSF and the corresponding new Radio Access Network.

   The described hand-off procedure provides a basic hand-off handling
   in that it requires a new mobile node registration to trigger the
   Mobility Binding update to the network.  The service disruption due
   to the time required to detect the loss of communication and to
   discover the new MSF and register with it can be minimized by
   selecting the fast keepalive timers but this in turn will result in
   the increased processing overhead and a possible impact on
   scalability.  At the same time the frequency of the hand-offs between
   the MSF LER nodes can reasonably be expected to be much lower then
   the frequency of the Layer 2 hand-offs because the MSF enabled LER is
   expected to serve a large area potentially covered by multiple Radio
   Access Networks.  Therefore a reasonable configuration of the
   keepalive timers and the low frequency of the MSF-to-MSF hand-offs
   may result in an acceptable network responsiveness especially for
   disruption tolerant applications.

   In cases where the application sensitivity requires a better network
   responsiveness a number of more sophisticated hand-off methods can be
   implemented.  One of the methods may make use of the Group
   Registration as described above.  In this case no discovery or
   registration is required from the mobile node when it moves into the
   new service area - it simply must continue to send packets to the



Berzin & Malis             Expires May 2, 2008                 [Page 46]

Internet-Draft        Mobility Label Based Network          October 2007


   group address and whichever group member happens to be serving the
   mobile node will distribute the pre-assigned Mobility Label to update
   the network.  Thus the hand-off latency becomes only a function of
   the MP-BGP update processing as opposed to being a function of a
   combination of a potentially lengthy discovery and registration as
   well as the MP-BGP update procedures.  Again, this scheme requires a
   trade-off analysis between the gain in the network responsiveness and
   the cost in signaling and processing required to maintain the shared
   registration table.

4.3.  Micro-Mobility Handling

   In the context of Mobile IP Micro-Mobility can be defined as a range
   of the mobile node movements that do not require re-registrations
   with the Mobile IP HA.  A number of proposals exist that are targeted
   to extend the range of micro-mobility by utilizing the hierarchical
   mobility management schemes.

   In the context of this document micro-mobility is defined as the
   range of the mobile node's movements that do not result in the
   registration with a new MSF or the network update by MP-BGP, or both.
   As such the following two micro-mobility scenarios are considered by
   this proposal.

4.3.1.  Local Micro-Mobility

   Local micro-mobility is defined as the range of movements of the
   mobile node that is contained within the serving area of a given MSF
   enabled LER node.  Referring to Figure 1 this moving pattern would
   correspond to the mobile node transitioning between the radio cells
   associated with the L3 logical interfaces local to the serving LER
   node.  Clearly such a movement pattern should not result in either
   the re-registration with the MSF or the network update by MP-BGP.

   In order to support Local Micro-Mobility the MSF should have the
   capability of "tracking" the mobile node association with the LER L3
   logical interfaces.  This "tracking" may simply be based on the
   reception of the datagrams from the mobile node.  If the packets from
   the same L2 address and L3 source addresses started arriving on a new
   L3 logical interface of the LER and the MSF registration for the
   mobile node in question is active the MSF should associate the new L3
   logical interface with the existing registration entry and the
   corresponding local Mobility Binding.

4.3.2.  Group Micro-Mobility

   Group Micro-Mobility makes direct use of the Group Registration
   described in Section 3.1.3.  In this case the Group Micro-Mobility is

   defined as the range of the mobile node's movements that do not
   result in the MSF re-registration process.  Group Micro-Mobility
   still requires the network update by MP-BGP.

5.  Datagram Delivery

   The delivery of packets from the MSF registered mobile node to other
   network destinations uses the same processing as in the other MPLS
   services.  Namely, when a packet is received from the mobile node the
   LER looks up the MPLS forwarding database to find a FEC to which the
   destination IP address belongs.  Once the FEC is identified the
   corresponding MPLS label (or label stack) is used to send the packet
   on the LSP toward the destination.

   For the packets destined to the mobile node, when the packet is
   received by the LER the MSF performs a lookup in the overlay MPLS
   forwarding table to find the Mobility Binding matching the
   destination address of the mobile node (this binding entry was
   populated as the result of the Mobility Binding Distribution
   process).  Once the match is found the inner MPLS label is pushed
   onto the MPLS label stack.  Then the LER performs an additional
   lookup to find a FEC and the corresponding label matching the "Origin
   MP-BGP NEXT_HOP" LER IP address associated with this Mobility
   Binding.  This outer label is then pushed onto the MPLS label stack
   and the packet is forwarded on the LSP.

   At the receiving MSF enabled LER the packet is processed and the
   inner MPLS label is examined to find the reverse Mobility Binding
   match in order to identify the IP address of the mobile node.  Once
   the IP address is identified the corresponding Layer 2 address is
   found in the MSF registration database.  The packet payload is then
   encapsulated into the Layer 2 protocol and delivered to the mobile
   node.

   In the case when the mobility service is provided to the mobile
   router, the forwarding of packets follows the same procedure for the
   service provider MPLS network segment.  The packet forwarding between
   the mobile router and the serving MSF enabled LER does not have to
   use MPLS and can be based on IPv4 or IPv6 and the corresponding radio
   attachment layer 2 protocol.

6.  Security Considerations

   The Lightweight Registration procedure (see Section 3.1.3.1.1) and
   the associated Network Update and traffic processing provides the
   capability to bypass the Full Registration mode in favor of the
   ability to significantly decrease the registration processing time.
   From the security perspective this procedure should only be allowed
   if the layer 2 radio access network provides acceptable mobile node
   authentication.

   To provide for stronger authentication, the Full or the Group
   Registration procedures must be used (see Section 3.1.3.1.2,
   Section 3.1.3.1.3).  These procedures allow to use additional
   authentication procedures by making use of the Registration Request
   and Reply message extensions (see Figure 10, Figure 11).

   For the Mobile Routers, existing routing protocol security procedures
   such as the peer authentication may be used.
