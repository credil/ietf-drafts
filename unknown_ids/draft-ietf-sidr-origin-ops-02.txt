Internet-Draft   RPKI-Based Origin Validation Operation     January 2011


1.  Introduction

   RPKI-based origin validation relies on widespread propagation of the
   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch].  How
   the RPKI is distributed and maintained globally is a serious concern
   from many aspects.

   The global RPKI has yet to be deployed, only a testbed exists, and
   some beta testing is being done by the IANA and some RIRs.  It is
   expected to be deployed incrementally over a number of years.  It is
   thought that origin validation based on the RPKI will deploy over the
   next year to five years.

   Origin validation only need be done by an AS's border routers and is
   designed so that it can be used to protect announcements which are
   originated by large providers, upstreams and downstreams, and by
   small stub/entetprise/edge routers.

   Origin validation has been designed to be deployed on current routers
   without hardware upgrade.  It should be used by everyone from large
   backbones to small stub/entetprise/edge routers.

   RPKI-based origin validation has been designed so that, with prudent
   local routing policies, there is little risk that normal Internet
   routing is threatened by unprudent deployment of the global RPKI, see
   Section 5.


2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, [RFC4271], the RPKI,
   see [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch], the RPKI Repository Structure, see
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-repos-struct], ROAs, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-format],
   the RPKI to Router Protocol, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr], and RPKI-
   based Prefix Validation, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-pfx-validate].


3.  RPKI Distribution and Maintenance

   The RPKI is a distributed database containing certificates, CRLs,
   manifests, ROAs, and Ghostbuster Records as described in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-repos-struct].  Policies and considerations for RPKI
   object generation and maintenance are discussed elsewhere.

   A local valid cache containing all RPKI data may be gathered from the
   global distributed database using the rsync protocol and a validation
   tool such as rcynic.

   Validated caches may also be created and maintained from other
   validated caches.  An operator should take maximum advantage of this
   feature to minimize load on the global distributed RPKI database.

   As RPKI-based origin validation relies on the availability of RPKI
   data, operators will likely want border routers to have one or more
   nearby caches.

   For redundancy, a router may peer with more than one cache at the
   same time.  Peering with two or more, one local and others remote, is
   recommended.

   If an operator or site trusts upstreams to carry their traffic, they
   might as well trust the RPKI data those upstreams cache and peer with
   of those caches.  Note that this places an obligation on those
   upstreams to maintain fresh and reliable caches.

   A transit provider or a network with peers will want to validate
   origins in announcements made by downstreams and peers.  They still
   may choose to trust the caches provided by their upstreams.


4.  Within a Network

   Origin validation need only be done by edge routers in a network,
   those which border other networks/ASs.

   A validating router will use the result of origin validation to
   influence local policy within its network, see Section 5.  In
   deployment this policy should fit into the AS's existing policy,
   preferences, etc.  This allows a network to incrementally deploy
   validation capable border routers.

   eBGP speakers which face more critical peers or up/downstreams would
   be candidates for the earliest deployment.  Validating more critical
   received announcements should be considered in partial deployment.


5.  Routing Policy

   Origin validation based on the RPKI merely marks a received
   announcement as having an origin which is Valid, NotFound, or
   Invalid.  See [I-D.ietf-sidr-pfx-validate].  How this is used in
   routing is specified by the operator's local policy.

   Local policy using relative preference is suggested to manage the
   uncertainty associated with a system in flux, applying local policy
   to eliminate the threat of unroutability of prefixes due to ill-

   advised certification policies and/or incorrect certification data.
   E.g. until the community feels comfortable relying on RPKI data,
   routing on Invalid origin validity, though at a low preference, will
   likely be prevalent for a long time.

   As origin validation will be rolled out incrementally, coverage will
   be incomplete for a long time.  Therefore, routing on NotFound
   validity state will be advisable for a long time.  As the transition
   moves forward, the number of BGP announcements with validation state
   NotFound should decrease.  Hence an operator's policy should not be
   overly strict, preferring Valid announcements, attaching a lower
   preference to, but still using, NotFound announcements, and giving
   very low preference to, but still using, Invalid announcements.

   Some may choose to use the large Local-Preference hammer.  Others
   might choose to let AS-Path rule and set their internal metric, which
   comes after AS-Path in the BGP decision process.

   Announcements with Valid origins SHOULD be preferred over those with
   NotFound or Invalid origins.

   Announcements with NotFound origins SHOULD be preferred over those
   with Invalid origins.

   Announcements with Invalid origins MAY be used, but SHOULD be less
   preferred than those with Valid or NotFound.


6.  Notes

   Like the DNS, the global RPKI presents only a loosely consistent
   view, depending on timing, updating, fetching, etc.  Thus, one cache
   or router may have different data about a particular prefix than
   another cache or router.  There is no 'fix' for this, it is the
   nature of distributed data with distributed caches.

   There is some uncertainty about the origin AS of aggregates and what,
   if any, ROA can be used.  The long range solution to this is the
   deprecation of AS-SETs, see [I-D.wkumari-deprecate-as-sets].


7.  Security Considerations

   As the BGP origin is not signed, origin validation is open to
   malicious spoofing.  It is only designed to deal with inadvertent
   mis-advertisement.

   Origin validation does nothing about AS-Path validation and therefore

   is open to monkey in the middle path attacks.

   The data plane may not follow the control plane.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA Considerations.
