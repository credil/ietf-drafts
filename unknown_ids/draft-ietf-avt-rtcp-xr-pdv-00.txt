Internet-Draft       RTCP XR Packet Delay Variation         October 2008


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Packet Delay Variation Metrics Block

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The new block type provides information on Packet Delay Variation
   using one of several standard metrics.

   The metrics belong to the class of transport metrics defined in
   [MONARCH] (work in progress).

   Instances of this Metrics Block refer by tag to the separate
   auxiliary Measurement Identity block [MEASIDENT] which contains
   information such as the SSRC of the measured stream, and RTP sequence
   numbers and time intervals indicating the span of the report.

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This draft defines a new Extended Report block that
   MUST be used as defined in [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [PMOLFRAME] provides guidance on
   the definition and specification of performance metrics.  Metrics
   described in this draft either reference external definitions or
   define metrics generally in accordance with the guidelines in
   [PMOLFRAME].

1.4.  Applicability

   These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications.

   arriving at the RTP system.

2.2.  Definition of Fields in PDV Metrics Block

   block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Packet Delay Variation Metrics Report Block is identified by the
      constant NJB.

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NPDV with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Packet Delay Variation
      metrics block is an Interval or a Cumulative report, that is,
      whether the reported values apply to the most recent measurement
      interval duration between successive metrics reports (I=1) (the
      Interval Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=0) (the Cumulative Duration).
      Numerical values for both these intervals are provided in the
      Measurement Identifier block referenced by the tag field below.

   Measurement Identifier association (tag): 3 bits

      This field is used to identify the Measurement Identifier block
      [MEASIDENT] which describes this measurement.  The relevant
      Measurement Identifier block has the same tag value as the Packet

      Delay Variation Metrics block.  Note that there may be more than
      one Measurement Identifier block per RTCP packet.

   Packet Delay Variation Metric Type (pdvtyp): 4 bits

      This field is used to identify the Packet Delay Variation Metric
      Type used in this report block, according to the following code:


       bits 014-017
           0: PPDV according to [RFC3550],
           1: MAPDV according to [G.1020],
           2: IPDV according to [Y.1540]
           Other values reserved

   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Packet Delay Variation Metrics block, the block length is
      equal to 3.

   Positive Threshold/Peak PDV: 16 bit, S11:4 format

      The PDV associated with the Positive PDV percentile expressed in
      milliseconds.  The term Positive is associated with packets
      arriving later than the expected time.

      If the measured value is more negative than -2047.9375 (the value
      which would be coded as 0x8001), the value 0x8000 SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range negative measurement.  If the
      measured value is more positive than +2047.8125 (the value which
      would be coded as 0x7FFD), the value 0x7FFE SHOULD be reported to
      indicate an over-range positive measurement.  If the measurement
      is unavailable, the value 0x7FFF SHOULD be reported.

   Positive PDV Percentile: 16 bit, 8:8 format

      The percentage of packets on the call for which individual packet
      delays were less than the Positive Threshold PDV.

      If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be
      reported.

   Negative Threshold/Peak PDV: 16 bit, S11:4 format

      The PDV associated with the Negative PDV percentile expressed in
      milliseconds.  The term Negative is associated with packets
      arriving earlier than the expected time.

Internet-Draft       RTCP XR Packet Delay Variation         October 2008


      If the measured value is more negative than -2047.9375 (the value
      which would be coded as 0x8001), the value 0x8000 SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range negative measurement.  If the
      measured value is more positive than +2047.8125 (the value which
      would be coded as 0x7FFD), the value 0x7FFE SHOULD be reported to
      indicate an over-range positive measurement.  If the measurement
      is unavailable, the value 0x7FFF SHOULD be reported.

   Negative PDV Percentile: 16 bit, 8:8 format

      The percentage of packets on the call for which individual packet
      delays were more than the Negative Threshold PDV.

      If the measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be
      reported.

   If the PDV Type indicated is IPDV and the Positive and Negative PDV
   Percentiles are set to 100.0 then the Positive and Negative
   Threshold/Peak PDV values are the peak values measured during the
   reporting interval (which may be from the start of the call for
   cumulative reports).  In this case, the difference between the
   Positive and Negative Threshold/Peak values defines the range of
   IPDV.

   Mean PDV: (16 bit, S11:4 format) expressed in milliseconds

      For MAPDV this value is generated according to [G.1020].  For
      interval reports the MAPDV value is reset at the start of the
      interval.

      For PPDV the value reported is the value of J(i) calculated
      according to [RFC3550] at the time the report is generated.

      For IPDV, the value reported is the mean of per-packet IPDV
      values.  This metric indicates the arrival time of the first media
      packet of the session with respect to the mean of the arrival
      times of every packet of the session.  A single value of the
      metric (for a single session) may not be useful by itself, but its
      average over a number of sessions may be useful in diagnosing
      media delay at session startup.  For example, this might occur if
      media packets are often delayed behind signalling packets due to
      head-of-line blocking.

      If the measured value is more negative than -2047.9375 (the value
      which would be coded as 0x8001), the value 0x8000 SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range negative measurement.  If the
      measured value is more positive than +2047.8125 (the value which
      would be coded as 0x7FFD), the value 0x7FFE SHOULD be reported to

      indicate an over-range positive measurement.  If the measurement
      is unavailable, the value 0x7FFF SHOULD be reported.

   unused: 16 bits

      These bits are unused.  They SHOULD be set to zero by the sender
      and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

2.3.  Examples of use

   (a) To report PPDV (RFC3550):

   Threshold PDV = FFFF (Undefined); PDV Percentile = FFFF (Undefined);
   PDV type = 0 (PPDV)

   causes PPDV to be reported in the Mean PDV field.

   (b) To report MAPDV (G.1020):

   Pos Threshold PDV = 50.0; Pos PDV Percentile = 95.3; Neg Threshold
   PDV = 50.0 (note - implies -50ms); Neg PDV Percentile = 98.4; PDV
   type = 1 (MAPDV)

   causes average MAPDV to be reported in the Mean PDV field.

   Note that implementations may either fix the reported percentile and
   calculate the associated PDV level OR may fix a threshold PDV level
   and calculate the associated percentile.  From a practical
   implementation perspective it is simpler to use the second of these
   approaches (except of course in the extreme case of a 100%
   percentile).

   IPDV, according to Y.1540 is the difference in delay between the
   current packet and the first packet of the stream.  If the sending
   and receiving clocks are not synchronized, this metric includes the
   effect of relative timing drift.

3.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

   (defined in [RFC3611])

   xr-format = xr-format / xr-pdv-block

        xr-pdv-block  = "delay" [ "," pdvtype ] [ "," nspec "," pspec ]


        pdvtype     = "pdv="    0      ; ppdv  RFC 3550
                              / 1      ; mapdv ITU-T G.1020
                              / 2      ; ipdv  ITU-T Y.1540
        nspec       = "nthr=" fixpoint     ; negative threshold PDV (ms)
                    / "npc=" fixpoint    ; negative PDV percentile
        pspec       = "pthr=" fixpoint     ; positive threshold PDV (ms)
                    / "ppc=" fixpoint    ; positive PDV percentile


        fixpoint       = 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT  ; fixed point decimal
        DIGIT          = %x30-39

   When SDP is used in offer-answer, a system sending SDP may request a
   specific type of PDV measurement.  In addition, they may state a
   specific percentile or threshold value, and expect to receive the
   corresponding threshold or percentile metric, respectively.  The
   system receiving the SDP SHOULD send the PDV metrics requested, but
   if the metric is not available, the system receiving the SDP SHOULD
   send the flag value indicating that the metric is unavailable.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates a new block type within the IANA "RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry" called the Packet Delay Variation Metrics Block, and a
   new parameter xr-pdv within the "RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry".

5.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
