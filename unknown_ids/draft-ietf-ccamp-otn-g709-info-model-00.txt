      Information model for G.709 Optical Transport Networks (OTN)
                draft-ietf-ccamp-otn-g709-info-model-00

Abstract

   The recent revision of ITU-T recommendation G.709 [G.709-v3] has
   introduced new fixed and flexible ODU containers in Optical Transport
   Networks (OTNs), enabling optimized support for an increasingly
   abundant service mix.

   This document provides a model of information needed by the routing
   and signaling process in OTNs to support Generalized Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (GMPLS) control of all currently defined ODU
   containers.

Internet-Draft       Information model for G.709 OTN          April 2011


1.  Introduction

   GMPLS[RFC3945] extends MPLS to include Layer-2 Switching (L2SC),
   Time-Division Multiplexing (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, and OTN),
   Wavelength (OCh, Lambdas) Switching and Spatial Switching (e.g.,
   incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber).

   The establishment of LSPs that span only interfaces recognizing
   packet/cell boundaries is defined in [RFC3036, RFC3212, RFC3209].
   [RFC3471] presents a functional description of the extensions to
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) signaling required to support
   GMPLS.  ReSource reserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
   -specific formats,mechanisms and technology specific details are
   defined in [RFC3473].

   From a routing perspective, Open Shortest Path First-Traffic
   Engineering (OSPF-TE) generates Link State Advertisements (LSAs)
   carrying application-specific information and floods them to other
   nodes as defined in [RFC5250].  Three types of opaque LSA are
   defined, i.e. type 9 - link-local flooding scope, type 10 - area-
   local flooding scope, type 11 - AS flooding scope.

   Type 10 LSAs are composed of a standard LSA header and a payload
   including one top-level TLV and possible several nested sub-TLVs.
   [RFC3630] defines two top-level TLVs: Router Address TLV and Link
   TLV; and nine possible sub-TLVs for the Link TLV, used to carry link
   related TE information.  The Link type sub-TLVs are enhanced by
   [RFC4203] in order to support GMPLS networks and related specific
   link information.  In GMPLS networks each node generates TE LSAs to
   advertise its TE information and capabilities (link-specific or node-
   specific)through the network.  The TE information carried in the LSAs
   are collected by the other nodes of the network and stored into their
   local Traffic Engineering Databases (TED).

   In a GMPLS enabled G.709 Optical Transport Networks (OTN), routing
   and signaling are fundamental in order to allow automatic calculation
   and establishment of routes for ODUk LSPs.  The recent revision of
   ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G709-V3] has introduced new fixed and
   flexible ODU containers that augment those specified in foundation
   OTN.  As a result, it is necessary to provide OSPF-TE and RSVP-TE
   extensions to allow GMPLS control of all currently defined ODU
   containers.

   This document provides the information model needed by the routing
   and signaling processses in OTNs to allow GMPLS control of all
   currently defined ODU containers.

   OSPF-TE and RSVP-tE requirements are defined in [OTN-FWK], while

   protocol extensions are defined in [OTN-OSPF] and [OTN-RSVP].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  OSPF-TE requirements overview

   [OTN-FWK] provides a set of functional routing requirements
   summarized below :

      - Support for link multiplexing capability advertisement: The
      routing protocol has to be able to carry information regarding the
      capability of an OTU link to support different type of ODUs

      - Support of any ODUk and ODUflex: The routing protocol must be
      capable of carrying the required link bandwidth information for
      performing accurate route computation for any of the fixed rate
      ODUs as well as ODUflex.

      - Support for differentiation between switching and terminating
      capacity

      - Support for the client server mappings as required by
      [G.7715.1].  The list of different mappings methods is reported in
      [G.709-v3].  Since different methods exist for how the same client
      layer is mapped into a server layer, this needs to be captured in
      order to avoid the set-up of connections that fail due to
      incompatible mappings.

      - Support different priorities for resource reservation.  How many
      priorities levels should be supported depends on operator
      policies.  Therefore, the routing protocol should be capable of
      supporting either no priorities or up to 8 priority levels as
      defined in [RFC4202].

      - Support link bundling either at the same line rate or different
      line rates (e.g. 40G and 10G).  Bundling links at different rates
      makes the control plane more scalable and permits better
      networking flexibility.

3.  RSVP-TE requirements overview

   [OTN-FWK] also provides a set of functional signaling requirements
   summarized below :

      - Support for LSP setup of new ODUk/ODUflex containers with
      related mapping and multiplexing capabilities

      - Support for LSP setup using different Tributary Slot granularity

      - Support for Tributary Port Number allocation and negoziation

      - Support for constraint signaling


4.  G.709 Digital Layer Info Model for Routing and Signaling

   The digital OTN layered structure is comprised of digital path layer
   networks (ODU) and digital section layer networks (OTU).  An OTU
   section layer supports one ODU path layer as client and provides
   monitoring capability for the OCh.  An ODU path layer may transport a
   heterogeneous assembly of ODU clients.  Some types of ODUs (i.e.,
   ODU1, ODU2, ODU3, ODU4) may assume either a client or server role
   within the context of a particular networking domain.  ITU-T G.872
   recommendation provides two tables defining mapping and multiplexing
   capabilities of OTNs, which are reproduced below.

                   Figure 2: OTN multiplexing capability

   How an ODUk connection service is transported within an operator
   network is governed by operator policy.  For example, the ODUk
   connection service might be transported over an ODUk path over an
   OTUk section, with the path and section being at the same rate as
   that of the connection service (see Table 1).  In this case, an
   entire lambda of capacity is consumed in transporting the ODUk
   connection service.  On the other hand, the operator might exploit
   different multiplexing capabilities in the network to improve
   infrastructure efficiencies within any given networking domain.  In

Internet-Draft       Information model for G.709 OTN          April 2011


   this case, ODUk multiplexing may be performed prior to transport over
   various rate ODU servers (as per Table 2) over associated OTU
   sections.

   From the perspective of multiplexing relationships, a given ODUk may
   play different roles as it traverses various networking domains.

   As detailed in [OTN-FWK], client ODUk connection services can be
   transported over:

      o Case A) one or more wavelength sub-networks connected by optical
      links or

      o Case B) one or more ODU links (having sub-lambda and/or lambda
      bandwidth granularity)

      o Case C) a mix of ODU links and wavelength sub-networks.

   This document considers the TE information needed for ODU path
   computation and parameters needed to be signaled for LSP setup.

   The following sections list and analyze each type of data that needs
   to be advertised and signaled in order to support path computation
   and LSP setup.

4.1.  Tributary Slot type

   ITU-T recommendations define two types of TS but each link can only
   support a single type at a given time.  The rules to be followed when
   selecting the TS to be used are:

      - If both ends of a link can support both 2.5Gbps TS and 1.25Gbps
      TS, then the link will work with 1.25Gbps TS.

      - If one end can support the 1.25Gbps TS, and another end the
      2.5Gbps TS, the link will work with 2.5Gbps TS.

   In case the bandwidth accounting is provided in number of TSs, the
   type of TS is needed to perform correct routing operations.
   Currently such information is not provided by the routing protocol
   and not taken into account during LSP signaling.

   The tributary slot type information is one of the parameters needed
   to correctly configure physical interfaces, therefore it has to be
   signaled via RSVP-TE.  This allows the end points of the FA knwo
   which TS should be used.

   [editor note]: SG15 ITU-T G.798 describes the so called PT=21-to-



Belotti, et al.         Expires October 20, 2011                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       Information model for G.709 OTN          April 2011


   PT=20 interworking process that explains how two equipments with
   different PayloadType, and hence different TS granularity (1.25Gbps
   vs. 2.5Gbps), can be coordinated so to permit the equipment with 1.25
   TS granularity to adapt his TS allocation accordingly to the
   different TS granularity (2.5Gbps) of a neighbour.  Therefore, in
   order to let the NE change TS granularity accordingly to the
   nieghbour requirements, the AUTOpayloadtype needs to be configured
   and the HO ODU source can be either not provisioned (i.e.  TS not
   allocated) or configured following a specific mapping depending of
   the type of LO ODU carried.  In this case the process of auto-
   negotiation makes the system self consistent and the only reason for
   signaling the TS granularity is to provide the correct label (i.e.
   label for PT=21 has twice the TS number of PT=20).  On the other
   side, if the AUTOpayloadtype is not configured, the RSVP-TE
   consequent actions in case of TS mismatch need to be defined.

4.2.  Tributary Port Number

   [RFC4328] supports only the deprecated auto-MSI mode which assumes
   that the Tributary Port Number is automatically assigned in the
   transmit direction and not checked in the receive direction.

   As described in [G709-V3] and [G798-V3], the OPUk overhead in an OTUk
   frame contains n (n = the total number of TSs of the ODUk) MSI
   (Multiplex Structure Identifier) bytes (in the form of multi-frame),
   each of which is used to indicate the association between tributary
   port number and tributary slot of the ODUk.

   The association between TPN and TS has to be configured by the
   control plane and checked by the data plane on each side of the link.
   (Please refer to [OTN-FWK] for further details).  As a consequence,
   the RSVP-TE signaling needs to be extended to support the TPN
   assignment function.

4.3.  Signal type

   From a routing perspetive, [RFC 4203] allows advertising foundation
   G.709 (single TS type) without the capability of providing precise
   information about bandwidth specific allocation.  For example, in
   case of link bundling, dividing the unreserved bandwidth by the MAX
   LSP bandwidth it is not possible to know the exact number of LSPs at
   MAX LSP bandwidth size that can be set up. (see example fig. 3)

   The lack of spatial allocation heavily impacts the restoration
   process, because the lack of information of free resources highly
   increases the number of crank-backs affecting network convergence
   time.

Internet-Draft       Information model for G.709 OTN          April 2011


   Moreover actual tools provided by OSPF-TE only allow advertising
   signal types with fixed bandwidth and implicit hierarchy (e.g.  SDH/
   SONET networks) or variable bandwidth with no hierarchy (e.g. packet
   switching networks) but do not provide the means for advertising
   networks with mixed approach (e.g.  ODUflex CBR and ODUflex packet).

   For example, advertising ODU0 as MIN LSP bandwidth and ODU4 as MAX
   LSP bandwidth it is not possible to state whether the advertised link
   supports ODU4 and ODUflex or ODU4, ODU3, ODU2, ODU1, ODU0 and
   ODUflex.  Such ambiguity is not present in SDH networks where the
   hierarchy is implicit and flexible containers like ODUFlex do not
   exist.  The issue could be resolved by declaring 1 ISCD for each
   signal type actually supported by the link.

   Supposing for example to have an equivalent ODU2 unreserved bandwidth
   in a TE-link (with bundling capability) distributed on 4 ODU1, it
   would be advertised via the ISCD in this way:

      MAX LSP Bw: ODU1

      MIN LSP Bw: ODU1

      - Maximum Reservable Bandwidth (of the bundle) set to ODU2

      - Unreserved Bandwidth (of the bundle) set to ODU2

   Moreover with the current IETF solutions, ([RFC4202], [RFC4203]) as
   soon as no bandwidth is available for a certain signal type it is not
   advertised into the related ISCD, losing also the related capability
   until bandwidth is freed.

   In conclusion, the OSPF-TE extensions defined in [RFC4203] require a
   different ISCD per signal type in order to advertise each supported
   container.  This motivates attempting to look for a more optimized
   solution, without proliferations of the number of ISCD advertised.
   The OSPF LSA is required to stay within a single IP PDU;
   fragmentation is not allowed.  In a conforming Ethernet environment,
   this limits the LSA to 1432 bytes (Packet_MTU (1500 Bytes) -
   IP_Header (20 bytes) - OSPF_Header (28 bytes) - LSA_Header (20
   bytes)).

   With respect to link bundling, the utilization of the ISCD as it is,
   would not allow precise advertising of spatial bandwidth allocation
   information unless using only one component link per TE link.

   On the other hand, from a singaling point of view, [RFC4328]
   describes GMPLS signaling extensions to support the control for G.709
   OTNs [G709-V1].  However,[RFC4328] needs to be updated because it

   does not provide the means to signal all the new signal types and
   related mapping and multiplexing functionalities.

4.4.  Bit rate and tolerance

   In the current traffic parameters signaling, bit rate and tolerance
   are implicitly defined by the signal type.  ODUflex CBR and Packet
   can have variable bit rates and tolerances (please refer to [OTN-FWK]
   table 2); it is thus needed to upgrade the signaling traffic
   patameters so to specify requested bit rates and tolerance values
   during LSP setup.

4.5.  Unreserved Resources

   Unreserved resources need to be advertised per priority and per
   signal type in order to allow the correct functioning of the
   restoration process.  [RFC4203] only allows advertising unreserved
   resources per priority, this leads not to know how many LSPs of a
   specific signal type can be restored.  As example it is possible to
   consider the scenario depicted in the following figure.


                  +------+ component link 1 +------+
                  |      +------------------+      |
                  |      | component link 2 |      |
                  |  N1  +------------------+  N2  |
                  |      | component link 3 |      |
                  |      +------------------+      |
                  +------+                  +---+--+


                   Figure 3: Concurrent path computation

   Suppose to have a TE link comprising 3 ODU3 component links with
   32TSs available on the first one, 24TSs on the second, 24TSs on the
   third and supporting ODU2 and ODU3 signal types.  The node would
   advertise a TE link unreserved bandwidth equal to 80 TSs and a MAX
   LSP bandwidth equal to 32 TSs.  In case of restoration the network
   could try to restore 2 ODU3 (64TSs) in such TE-link while only a
   single ODU3 can be set up and a crank-back would be originated.  In
   more complex network scenarios the number of crank-backs can be much
   higher.

4.6.  Maximum LSP Bandwidth

   Maximum LSP bandwidth is currently advertised in the common part of
   the ISCD and advertised per priority, while in OTN networks it is
   only required for ODUflex advertising.  This leads to a significant

   waste of bits inside each LSA.

4.7.  Distinction between terminating and switching capability

   The capability advertised by an interface needs further distinction
   in order to separate termination and switching capabilities.  Due to
   internal constraints and/or limitations, the type of signal being
   advertised by an interface could be just switched (i.e. forwarded to
   switching matrix without multiplexing/demultiplexing actions), just
   terminated (demuxed) or both of them.  The following figures help
   explainig the switching and terminating capabilities.



             MATRIX                   LINE INTERFACE

       |                 |          |        \/       |
       |                 |          |         ---------> OTU-3
       +-----------------+          +-----------------+


             Figure 4: Switching and Terminating capabilities

   The figure in the example shows a line interface able to:

      - Multiplex an ODU2 coming from the switching matrix into and ODU3
      and map it into an OTU3

      - Map an ODU3 coming from the switching matrix into an OTU3

   In this case the interface bandwidth advertised is ODU2 with
   switching capability and ODU3 with both switching and terminating
   capabilities.

   This piece of information needs to be advertised together with the
   related unreserved bandwidth and signal type.  As a consequence
   signaling must have the possibility to setup an LSP allowing the

   local selection of resources consistent with the limitations
   considered during the path computation.

   In figures 6 and 7 there are two examples of the need of termination/
   switching capability differentiation.  In both examples all nodes are
   supposed to support single-stage capability.  The figure 6 addresses
   a scenario in which a failure on link B-C forces node A to calculate
   another ODU2 LSP path carrying ODU0 service along the nodes B-E-D.
   Being D a single stage capable node, it is able to extract ODU0
   service only from ODU2 interface.  Node A has to know that from E to
   D exists an available OTU2 link from which node D can extract the
   ODU0 service.  This information is required in order to avoid that
   the OTU3 link is considered in the path computation.

       Figure 5: Switching and Terminating capabilities - Example 1

   Figure 7 addresses the scenario in which the restoration of the ODU2
   LSP (ABCD) is required.  The two bundled component links between B
   and E could be used, but the ODU2 over the OTU2 component link can
   only be terminated and not switched.  This implies that it cannot be
   used to restore the ODU2 LSP (ABCD).  However such ODU2 unreserved
   bandwidth must be advertised since it can be used for a different
   ODU2 LSP terminating on E, e.g.  (FBE).  Node A has to know that the
   ODU2 capability on the OTU2 link can only be terminated and that the
   restoration of (ABCD) can only be performed using the ODU2 bandwidth
   available on the OTU3 link.

4.8.  Priority Support

   The IETF foresees that up to eight priorities must be supported and
   that all of them have to be advertised independently on the number of
   priorities supported by the implementation.  Considering that the
   advertisement of all the different supported signal types will
   originate large LSAs, it is advised to advertise only the information
   related to the really supported priorities.

4.9.  Multi-stage multiplexing

   With reference to the [OTN-FWK], introduction of multi-stage
   multiplexing implies the advertisement of cascaded adaptation
   capabilities together with the matrix access constraints.  The
   structure defined by IETF for the advertisement of adaptation
   capabilities is ISCD/IACD as in [RFC4202] and [RFC5339].
   Modifications to ISCD/IACD, if needed, have to be addressed in the
   releted encoding documents.

4.10.  Generalized Label

   The ODUk label format defined in [RFC4328] could be updated to
   support new signal types defined in [G709-V3] but would hardly be
   further enhanced to support possible new signal types.

   Furthermore such label format may have scalability issues due to the



Belotti, et al.         Expires October 20, 2011               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft       Information model for G.709 OTN          April 2011


   high number of labels needed when signaling large LSPs.  For example,
   when an ODU3 is mapped into an ODU4 with 1.25G tributary slots, it
   would require the utilization of thirty-one labels (31*4*8=992 bits)
   to be allocated while an ODUflex into an ODU4 may need up to eighty
   labels (80*4*8=2560 bits).

   A new flexible and scalable ODUk label format needs to be defined.
