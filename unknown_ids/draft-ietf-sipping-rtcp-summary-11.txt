 Session Initiation Protocol Event Package for Voice Quality Reporting
                   draft-ietf-sipping-rtcp-summary-11

Abstract

   This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event
   package that enables the collection and reporting of metrics that
   measure the quality for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) sessions.
   Voice call quality information derived from RTP Control Protocol
   Extended Reports (RTCP-XR) and call information from SIP is conveyed
   from a User Agent (UA) in a session, known as a reporter, to a third
   party, known as a collector.  A registration for the application/
   vq-rtcp-xr MIME type is also included.

Internet-Draft   SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting       June 2010


1.  Introduction

   Real time communications over IP networks use SIP for signaling with
   RTP/RTCP for media transport and reporting respectively.  These
   protocols are very flexible and can support an extremely wide
   spectrum of usage scenarios.  For this reason, extensions to these
   protocols must be specified in the context of a specific usage
   scenario.  In this memo, extensions to SIP are proposed to support
   the reporting of RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports [4] metrics.

1.1.  Applicability Statement

   RTP is utilized in many different architectures and topologies.  RFC
   5117 [15] lists and describes the following topologies: point to
   point, point to multipoint using multicast, point to multipoint using
   the RFC 3550 translator, point to multipoint using the RFC 3550 mixer
   model, point to multipoint using video switching MCUs, point to
   multipoint using RTCP-terminating MCU, and non-symmetric mixer/
   translators.  As the abstract to this document points out, this
   specification is for reporting quality of Voice over Internet
   Protocol(VoIP) sessions.  As such, only the first topology, point to
   point, is currently supported by this specification.  This reflects
   both current VoIP deployments which are predominantly point to point
   using unicast, and also the state of research in the area of quality.

   How to accurately report the quality of a multipart conference or a
   session involving multiple hops through translators and mixers is
   currently an area of research in the industry.  However, this
   mechanism can easily be used for centrally mixed conference calls, in
   which each leg of the conferences is just a point to point call.
   This mechanism could be extended to cover additional RTP topologies
   in the future once these topics progress out of the realm of research
   and into actual Internet deployments.

1.2.  Use of the Mechanism

   RTCP reports are usually sent to other participating endpoints in a
   session which can make collection of performance information by
   administration or management systems too complex.  In the usage
   scenarios addressed in this memo, the data contained in RTCP XR VoIP
   metrics reports (RFC3611 [4]) are forwarded to a central collection
   server systems using SIP.

   Applications residing in the server or elsewhere can aid in network
   management to alleviate bandwidth constraints and also to support
   customer service by identifying and acknowledging calls of poor
   quality.  Specifying such applications are however beyond the scope
   of this paper.

Internet-Draft   SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting       June 2010


   There is a large portfolio of quality parameters that can be
   associated with VoIP, but only a minimal necessary number of
   parameters are included on the RTCP-XR reports:

   1.  The codec type, as resulting from the SDP offer-answer
   negotiation in SIP,

   2.  The burst gap loss density and max gap duration, since voice cut-
   outs are the most annoying quality impairment in VoIP,

   3.  Round trip delay because it is critical to conversational
   quality,

   4.  Conversational quality as a catch-all for other voice quality
   impairments, such as random distributed packet loss, jitter, annoying
   silent suppression effects, etc.

   In specific usage scenarios where other parameters are required,
   designers can include other parameters beyond the scope of this
   paper.

   RTCP reports are best effort only, and though very useful have a
   number of limitations as discussed in [3].  This must be considered
   when using RTCP reports in managed networks.

   This document defines a new SIP event package, vq-rtcpxr, and a new
   MIME type, application/vq-rtcpxr, that enable the collection and
   reporting of metrics that measure quality for RTP [3] sessions.  The
   definitions of the metrics used in the event package are based on
   RTCP Extended Reports [4] and RTCP [3]; a mapping between the SIP
   event parameters and the parameters within the aforementioned RFC's
   is defined within this document in section 4.6.2.

   Monitoring of voice quality is believed to be the highest priority
   for usage of this mechanism and as such, the metrics in the event
   package are largely tailored for voice quality measurements.  The
   event package is designed to be extensible.  However the negotiation
   of such extensions is not defined in this document.

   The event package supports reporting both the voice quality metrics
   for both inbound and outbound directions.  Voice quality metrics for
   the inbound direction can generally be computed locally by the
   reporting endpoint however voice quality metrics for the outbound
   direction are computed by the remote endpoint and sent to the
   reporting endpoint using the RTCP Extended Reports [4].

   Configuration of usage of the event package is not covered in this
   document.  It is the recommendation of this document that the SIP

Internet-Draft   SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting       June 2010


   configuration framework [8] be used.  This is discussed in Section
   4.8.

   The event package SHOULD be used with the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY method
   however it MAY be also used with the PUBLISH method for backward
   compatibility with some existing implementations.  Message flow
   examples for both methods are provided in this document.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].


3.  SIP Events for VoIP Quality Reporting

   This document defines a SIP events package [5] for Voice over IP
   performance reporting.  A SIP UA can send these events to an entity
   which can make the information available to other applications.  For
   purposes of illustration, the entities involved in SIP vq-rtcpxr
   event reporting will be referred to as follows:

   o REPORTER is an entity involved in the measurement and reporting of
   media quality i.e. the SIP UA involved in a media session.

   o COLLECTOR is an entity that receives SIP vq-rtcpxr events.  A
   COLLECTOR may be a proxy server or another entity that is capable of
   supporting SIP vq-rtcpxr events.

3.1.  SUBSCRIBE NOTIFY Method

   The COLLECTOR SHALL send a SUBSCRIBE to the REPORTER to explicitly
   establish the relationship.  The REPORTER SHOULD send the voice
   quality metric reports using the NOTIFY method.  The REPORTER MUST
   NOT send any vq-rtcpxr events if a COLLECTOR address has not been
   configured.  The REPORTER populates the Request-URI according to the
   rules for an in-dialog request.  The COLLECTOR MAY send a SUBSCRIBE
   to a SIP Proxy acting on behalf of the reporting SIP UA's.

3.2.  PUBLISH Method

   A SIP UA that supports this specification MAY also send the service
   quality metric reports using the PUBLISH method, however this
   approach SHOULD NOT be used in unmanaged Internet services.  The
   PUBLISH method MAY be supported for backward compatibility with
   existing implementations.



Pendleton, et al.       Expires December 18, 2010               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting       June 2010


   The REPORTER MAY therefore populate the Request-URI of the PUBLISH
   method with the address of the COLLECTOR.  To ensure security of SIP
   proxies and the COLLECTOR, the REPORTER MUST be configured with the
   address of the COLLECTOR, preferably using the SIP UA configuration
   framework [8], as described in section 5.8.

   It is recommended that the REPORTER send an OPTIONS message to the
   COLLECTOR to ensure support of the PUBLISH message.

3.3.  Multi-Party and Multi-Segment Calls

   A voice quality metric report may be sent for each session
   terminating at the REPORTER and may contain multiple report bodies.
   For a multi-party call the report MAY contain report bodies for the
   session between the reporting endpoint and each remote endpoint for
   which there was an RTP session during the call.

   Multi-party services such as call hold and call transfer can result
   in the user participating in a series of concatenated sessions,
   potentially with different choices of codec or sample rate, although
   these may be perceived by the user as a single call.  A REPORTER MAY
   send a voice quality metric report at the end of each session or MAY
   send a single voice quality metric report containing a report body
   for each segment of the call.

3.4.  Overload Avoidance

   Users of this extension should ensure they implement general SIP
   mechanisms for avoiding overload.  For instance, an overloaded proxy
   or COLLECTOR MUST send a 503 Service Unavailable or other 5xx esponse
   with an appropriate Retry-After time specified.  REPORTERs MUST act
   on these responses and respect the retry after time interval.  In
   addition, future SIP extensions to better handle overload as covered
   in [17] should be followed as they are standardized.

   To avoid overload of SIP Proxies or COLLECTORS it is important to do
   capacity planning and to minimize the number of reports that are
   sent.

   Approaches to avoiding overload include:

   a.  Send only one report at the end of each call

   b.  Use interval reports only on "problem" calls that are being
   closely monitored

   c.  Limit the number of alerts that can be sent to a maximum of one
   per call.

4.  Event Package Formal Definition

4.1.  Event Package Name

   This document defines a SIP Event Package as defined in RFC 3265 [5].

4.2.  Event Package Parameters

   No event package parameters are defined.

4.3.  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   SUBSCRIBE bodies are described by this specification.

4.4.  Subscribe Duration

   Subscriptions to this event package MAY range from minutes to weeks.
   Subscriptions in hours or days are more typical and are RECOMMENDED.
   The default subscription duration for this event package is one hour.

4.5.  NOTIFY Bodies

   There are three notify bodies: a Session report, an Interval session
   report, and an Alert report.

   The Session report SHOULD be used for reporting when a voice media
   session terminates or when a media change occurs, such as a codec
   change or a session forks and MUST NOT be used for reporting at
   arbitrary points in time.  This report MUST be used for cumulative
   metric reporting and the report timestamps MUST be from the start of
   a media session to the time at which the report is generated.

   The Interval report SHOULD be used for periodic or interval reporting
   and MUST NOT be used for reporting for the complete media session.
   This report is intended to capture short duration metric reporting
   and the report intervals SHOULD be non-overlapping time windows.

   The Alert report MAY be used when voice quality degrades during a
   session.  The time window to which an Alert report relates MAY be a
   short time interval or from the start of the call to the point the
   alert is generated; this time window SHOULD be selected to provide
   the most useful information to support problem diagnosis.

   Session, Interval and Alert reports MUST populate the metrics with
   values that are measured over the interval explicitly defined by the
   "start" and "stop" timestamps.

   Voice quality summary reports reference only one codec (payload



Pendleton, et al.       Expires December 18, 2010               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting       June 2010


   type).  This payload type SHOULD be the main voice payload, not
   comfort noise or telephone events payloads.  For applications that
   consistently and rapidly switch codecs, the most used codec should be
   reported.  All values in the report, such as IP addresses, SSRC, etc
   represent those values as received by the REPORTER.  In some
   scenarios, these may not be the same on either end of the session -
   the COLLECTOR will need logic to be able to put these sessions
   together.  The values of parameters such as sample rate, frame
   duration, frame octets, packets per second, round trip delay, etc
   depend on the type of report they are present in.  If present in a
   Session or an Interval report, they represent average values over the
   session or interval.  If present in an Alert report, they represent
   instantaneous values.

   The REPORTER always shares local quality reporting information and
   should, if possible, share remote quality reporting information.
   This remote quality could be available from received RTCP-XR reports
   or other sources.  Reporting this is useful in cases where the other
   end might support RTCP-XR but not this voice quality reporting.

   This specification defines a new MIME type application/vq-rtcpxr
   which is a text encoding of the RTCP and RTCP-XR statistics with some
   additional metrics and correlation information.

4.6.  Voice Quality Event and Semantics

   This section describes the syntax extensions required for event
   publication in SIP.  The formal syntax definitions described in this
   section are expressed in the Augmented BNF [6] format used in SIP
   [2], and contains references to elements defined therein.

   Additionally, the definition of the timestamp format is provided in
   [7].  Note that most of the parameters are optional.  In practice,
   most implementations will send a subset of the parameters.  It is not
   the intention of this document to define what parameters may or may
   not be useful for monitoring the quality of a voice session, but to
   enable reporting of voice quality.  As such, the syntax allows the
   implementer to choose which metrics are most appropriate for their
   solution.  As there are no "invalid", "unknown", or "not applicable"
   values in the syntax, the intention is to exclude any parameters for
   which values are not available, not applicable, or unknown.

   The authors recognize that implementers may need to add new parameter
   lines to the reports and new metrics to the existing parameter lines.
   The extension tokens are intended to fulfill this need.

4.6.2.  Parameter Definitions and Mappings

   Parameter values, codec types and other aspects of the endpoints may
   change dynamically during a session.  The reported values of metrics
   and configuration parameters SHALL be the current value at the time
   the report is generated.

   The Packet Loss Rate and Packet Discard Rate parameters are
   calculated over the period between the starting and ending timestamps
   for the report.  These are normally calculated from a count of the
   number of lost or discarded packets divided by the count of the
   number of packets, and hence are based on the current values of these
   counters at the time the report was generated.

   Packet delay variation, signal level, noise level, echo level are
   computed as running or interval averages, based on the appropriate
   standard (e.g.  RFC3550 for PDV) and the sampled value of these
   running averages is reported.  Delay, packet size, jitter buffer size
   and codec related data may change during a session and the current
   value of these parameters is reported as sampled at the time the
   report is generated.

4.6.2.1.  General mapping percentages from 8 bit, fixed point numbers

   RFC3611 uses an 8 bit, fixed point number with the binary point at
   the left edge of the field.  This value is calculated by dividing the
   total number of packets lost by the total number of packets expected
   and multiplying the result by 256, and taking the integer part.

   For any RTCP XR parameter in this format, to map into the equivalent
   SIP vq-rtcpxr parameter, simply reverse the equation i.e. divide by
   256 and taking the integer part.

4.6.2.2.  Timestamps

   Following SIP and other IETF convention, timestamps are provided in
   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) using the ABNF format provided in
   RFC 3339 [7].  These timestamps SHOULD reflect, as closely as
   possible, the actual time during which the media session was running
   to enable correlation to related events occurring in the network and
   to accounting or billing records.

4.6.2.3.  SessionDescription

   The parameters in this field provide a shortened version of the
   session SDP(s), containing only the relevant parameters for session
   quality reporting purposes.  Where values may change durina a
   session, for example a codec may change rate, then the most recent
   value of the parameter is reported.

4.6.2.3.1.  Payload Type

   This is the "payload type" parameter used in the RTP packets i.e. the
   codec.  This field can also be mapped from the SDP "rtpmap" attribute
   field "payload type".  IANA registered types SHOULD be used.

4.6.2.3.2.  Payload Desc

   This parameter a text description of the codec.  This parameter
   SHOULD use the IANA registry for media-type names where it
   unambiguously defines the codec.  Refer to:
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/audio/

4.6.2.3.3.  Sample Rate

   This parameter is mapped from the SDP "rtpmap" attribute field "clock
   rate".  The field provides the rate at which voice was sampled,
   measured in Hertz (Hz).

4.6.2.3.4.  Packets Per Second

   This parameter is not contained in RTP or SDP but can usually be
   obtained from the device codec.  Packets per second provides the
   (rounded) number of RTP packets that are transmitted per second.

4.6.2.3.5.  Frame Duration

   This parameter is not contained in RTP or SDP but can usually be
   obtained from the device codec.  The field reflects the amount of
   voice content in each frame within the RTP payload, measured in
   milliseconds.  Note this value can be combined with the
   FramesPerPacket to determine the packetization rate.  Also, where a
   sample-based codec is used, a "frame" refers to the set of samples
   carried in an RTP packet.

4.6.2.3.6.  Frame Octets

   This parameter is not contained in RTP or SDP but is usually provided
   by the device codec.  The field provides the number of octets in each
   frame within the RTP payload.  This field is usually not provided
   when the FrameDuration is provided.  Also, where a sample-based codec
   is used, a "frame" refers to the set of samples carried in an RTP
   packet.

4.6.2.3.7.  Frames Per Packet

   This parameter is not contained in RTP or SDP but can usually be
   obtained from the device codec.  This field provides the number of
   frames in each RTP packet.  Note this value can be combined with the
   FrameDuration to determine the packetization rate.  Also, where a
   sample-based codec is used, a "frame" refers to the set of samples
   carried in an RTP packet.

4.6.2.3.8.  FMTP Options

   This parameter is taken directly from the SDP attribute "fmtp".

4.6.2.3.9.  Silence Suppression State

   This parameter does not correspond to SDP, RTP, or RTCP XR.  It
   indicates whether silence suppression, also known as Voice Activity
   Detection (VAD) is enabled for the identified session.

4.6.2.3.10.  Packet Loss Concealment

   This value corresponds to "PLC" in RFC3611 in the VoIP Metrics Report
   Block.  The values defined by RFC3611 are reused by this

   recommendation and therefore no mapping is required.

4.6.2.4.  LocalAddr

   This field provides the IP address, port and synchronization source
   (SSRC) for the session from the perspective of the endpoint that is
   measuring performance.  The IPAddress can be IPv4 or IPv6 format.
   The SSRC is taken from SDP, RTCP, or RTCP XR input parameters.

   In the presence of NAT and where a NAT-traversal mechanism such as
   STUN [9] is used, the external IP address can be reported, since the
   internal IP address is not visible to the network operator.

4.6.2.5.  RemoteAddr

   This field provides the IP address, port and ssrc of the session peer
   from the perspective of the remote endpoint measuring performance.
   In the presence of NAT and where a NAT-traversal mechanism such as
   STUN [9] is used, the external IP address can be reported, since the
   internal IP address is not visible to the network operator.

4.6.2.6.  Jitter Buffer Parameters

4.6.2.6.1.  Jitter Buffer Adaptive

   This field corresponds to "RERL" in RFC3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block.  This field provides the ratio between the original
   signal and the echo level in decibels, as measured after echo
   cancellation or suppression has been applied.  This value can be used
   directly without extra conversion.

4.6.2.11.  Quality Scores

4.6.2.11.1.  ListeningQualityR

   This field reports the listening quality expressed as an R factor
   (per G.107).  This does not include the effects of echo or delay.
   The range of R is 0-95 for narrowband calls and 0-120 for wideband
   calls.  Algorithms for computing this value SHOULD be compliant with
   ITU-T Recommendations P.564 [11] and G.107 [12].

4.6.2.11.2.  RLQEstAlg

   This field provides a text name for the algorithm used to estimate
   ListeningQualityR.  This field will be free form text and not
   necessarily reflective of any standards or recommendations.

4.6.2.11.3.  ConversationalQualityR

   This field corresponds to "R factor" in RFC3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block.  This parameter provides a cumulative measurement of
   voice quality from the start of the session to the reporting time.
   The range of R is 0-95 for narrowband calls and 0-120 for wideband
   calls.  Algorithms for computing this value SHOULD be compliant with
   ITU-T Recommendation P.564 and G.107.  Within RFC3611 a reported R
   factor of 127 indicates that this parameter is unavailable; in this
   case the ConversationalQualityR parameter MUST be omitted from the
   vq-rtcpxr event.

4.6.2.11.4.  RCQEstAlg

   This field provides a text name for the algorithm used to estimate
   ConversationalQualityR.  This field will be free form text and not
   necessarily reflective of any standards or recommendations.

   measured by the local endpoint for incoming connection on "other"
   side (refer to RFC3611 for a more detailed explanation).  The range
   of R is 0-95 for narrowband calls and 0-120 for wideband calls.
   Algorithms for computing this value SHOULD be compliant with ITU-T
   Recommendation P.564 and G.107.  Within RFC3611 a reported R factor
   of 127 indicates that this parameter is unavailable; in this case the
   ConversationalQualityR parameter MUST be omitted from the vq-rtcpxr
   event.

4.6.2.11.6.  ExtRInEstAlg

   This field provides a text name for the algorithm used to estimate
   ExternalR-In.  This field will be free form text and not necessarily
   reflective of any standards or recommendations.

4.6.2.11.7.  ExternalR-Out

   This field corresponds to "ext.  R factor" in RFC3611 in the VoIP
   Metrics Report Block.  Here, the value is copied from RTCP XR message
   received from the remote endpoint on "other" side of this endpoint
   refer to RFC3611 for a more detailed explanation).  The range of R is
   0-95 for narrowband calls and 0-120 for wideband calls.  Algorithms
   for computing this value SHOULD be compliant with ITU-T
   Recommendation P.564 and G.107.  Within RFC3611 a reported R factor
   of 127 indicates that this parameter is unavailable; in this case the
   ConversationalQualityR parameter SHALL be omitted from the vq-rtcpxr
   event.

4.6.2.11.8.  ExtROutEstAlg

   This field provides a text name for the algorithm used to estimate
   ExternalR-Out.  This field will be free form text and not necessarily
   reflective of any standards or recommendations.

4.6.2.11.9.  MOS Reporting

   Conversion of RFC3611 reported MOS scores for use in reporting MOS-LQ
   and MOS-CQ MUST be performed by dividing the RFC3611 reported value
   by 10 if this value is less than or equal to 50 or omitting the
   MOS-xQ parameter if the RFC3611 reported value is 127 (which
   indicates unavailable).

4.6.2.11.9.1.  MOS-LQ

   This field corresponds to "MOSLQ" in RFC3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block.  This parameter is the estimated mean opinion score for
   listening voice quality on a scale from 1 to 5, in which 5 represents
   "Excellent" and 1 represents "Unacceptable".  Algorithms for

   computing this value SHOULD be compliant with ITU-T Recommendation
   P.564 [11].  This field provides a text name for the algorithm used
   to estimate MOS-LQ.

4.6.2.11.9.2.  MOS-CQ

   This field corresponds to "MOSCQ" in RFC3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block.  This parameter is the estimated mean opinion score for
   conversation voice quality on a scale from 1 to 5, in which 5
   represents excellent and 1 represents unacceptable.  Algorithms for
   computing this value SHOULD be compliant with ITU-T Recommendation
   P.564 with regard to the listening quality element of the computed
   MOS score.

4.6.2.11.9.3.  MOSCQEstAlg

   This field provides a text name for the algorithm used to estimate
   MOS-CQ.  This field will be free form text and not necessarily
   reflective of any standards or recommendations.

4.6.2.11.10.  QoEEstAlg

   This field provides a text description of the algorithm used to
   estimate all voice quality metrics.  This parameter is provided as an
   alternative to the separate estimation algorithms for use when the
   same algorithm is used for all measurements.  This field will be free
   form text and not necessarily reflective of any standards or
   recommendations.

4.8.  Configuration Dataset for vq-rtcpxr Events

   It is the suggestion of the authors that the SIP configuration
   framework [8] be used to establish the necessary parameters for usage
   of vq-rtcpxr events.  A dataset for this purpose should be designed
   and documented in a separate draft upon completion of the framework.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new SIP Event Package and a new MIME type.

5.1.  SIP Event Package Registration

      Package name: vq-rtcpx
      Type: package
      Contact: Amy Pendleton <aspen@telchemy.com>
      Published Specification: This document

5.2.  application/vq-rtcp-xr MIME Registration

   MIME media type name: application
   MIME subtype name: vq-rtcpxr
   Mandatory parameters: none
   Optional parameters: none
   Encoding considerations: 7bit
   Security considerations: See next section.
   Interoperability considerations: none.
   Published specification: This document.

   Applications which use this media type: This document type is
   being used in notifications of VoIP quality reports.

   Additional Information:

   Magic Number: None
   File Extension: None
   Macintosh file type code: "TEXT"

      Personal and email address for further information: Amy Pendleton
      <aspen@telchemy.com>

      Intended usage: COMMON

      Author/Change controller: The IETF.


6.  Security Considerations

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide
   information about the nature and duration of a session established
   between two or more endpoints.  As a result, any third party wishing
   to obtain this information SHOULD be properly authenticated by the
   SIP UA using standard SIP mechanisms and according to the
   recommendations in [5].  Additionally the event content MAY be
   encrypted to ensure confidentiality; the mechanisms for providing
   confidentiality are detailed in [2].


7.  Contributors

   The authors would like to thank Rajesh Kumar, Dave Oran, Tom Redman,
   Shane Holthaus and Jack Ford for their comments and input.
