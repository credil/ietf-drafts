Abstract

   This document describes one of the network models that is designed
   for smooth transition to IPv6.  It is called NAT444 model.  NAT444
   model is composed of IPv6, and IPv4 with Large Scale NAT (LSN).

   NAT444 is the only scheme not to require replacing Customer Premises
   Equipment (CPE) even if IPv4 address exhausted.  But it must be noted
   that NAT444 has serious restrictions i.e. it limits the number of
   sessions per CPE so that rich applications such as AJAX and RSS feed
   cannot work well.

   Therefore, IPv6 which is free from such a difficulty has to be
   introduced into the network at the same time.  In other words, NAT444
   is just a tool to make IPv6 transition easy to be swallowed.  It is
   designed for the days IPv4 and IPv6 co-existence.

Internet-Draft       NAT444 with ISP Shared Address           March 2009


1.  Introduction

   The only permanent solution of the IPv4 address exhaustion is to
   deploy IPv6.  Now, just before the exhaustion, it's time to make a
   transition to IPv6.

   After the exhaustion, unless ISP takes any action, end users will not
   be able to get IPv4 address.

   The servers that have only IPv4 address will continue to exist on the
   Internet after the IPv4 address exhaustion.  In this situation, IPv6
   only hosts cannot reach IPv4 only hosts.

   This document explains NAT444 model that bridges the gap between the
   coming IPv6 Internet and the present IPv4 Internet.


2.  Definition of NAT444 Model

   NAT444 Model is a network model that uses two Network Address and
   Port Translators (NAPTs) with three types of IPv4 address blocks.

   The first NAPT is in CPE, and the second NAPT is in Large Scale NAT
   (LSN) [I-D.nishitani-cgn].  LSN is supposed to be installed in the
   ISP's network.

   The first IPv4 address block is Private Address [RFC1918] inside CPE.
   The second one is an IPv4 Address block between CPEs and LSN.  It
   could be Global Address, Private Address (10/8), Class-E (240/4)
   [I-D.wilson-class-e], or (newly defined) ISP Shared Address.  The
   third one is IPv4 Global Addresses that is outside LSN.  The ISPs
   using NAT444 provide IPv6 connectivity by dual stack model.

3.  Behavior of NAT444 Model

   The IPv6 packets from the host reach the IPv6 Internet without using
   NAT functionality.

   The following figure shows the behavior of the IPv4 packet from the
   host to the IPv4 server via two NATs.  The first NAT in CPE
   overwrites the Source IP Address and Source Port from 10.0.0.2:tt to
   w.w.w.w:uu.  Then the second NAT in LSN overwrites them from
   w.w.w.w:uu to y.y.y.y:vv.  Destination IP Address and Port are not
   overwritten.

   Address and Port Number from y.y.y.y:vv to w.w.w.w:uu.  Then the
   second NAT in CPE overwrites them from w.w.w.w:u to 10.0.0.2:tt.

4.  Pros and Cons of NAT444 Model

4.1.  Pros of NAT444 Model

   This network model has following advantages.

   - This is the only network model that doesn't require replacing CPEs
   those are owned by customers.
   - This network model is composed of the present technology.
   - This network model doesn't require address family translation.
   - This network model doesn't require DNS rewriting.
   - This network model doesn't require additional fragment for the
   packets because it doesn't use tunneling technology.

4.2.  Cons of NAT444 Model

   This network model has some technical restrictions.

   - Some application such as SIP requires special treatment, because IP
   address is written in the payload of the packet.  Special treatment
   means application itself aware double NAPT or both of two NAPTs

   support inspecting and rewriting the packets.
   - Because both IPv4 route and IPv6 route exist, it doubles the number
   of IGP route inside the LSN.
   - UPnP doesn't work with double NAPTs.


5.  Address Block of ISP's Network

   The address block mentioned in this section is the one between CPE
   and LSN.  The best address block is "ISP Shared Address" which is
   defined in [I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr] and briefly described in
   this section.

5.1.  Global Address

   ISP cannot assign IPv4 Global Address any more after the exhaustion.

5.2.  Private Address

   It has two major problems.

5.2.1.  Policy Based Routing Issue

   If both source and destination address of the packet are inside LSN,
   it has to go through LSN.  The reason is that some servers reject
   receiving packets when the source address of receiving packet is
   Private Address.  Therefore packets have to go through the LSN for
   rewriting the source address from Private Address to Global Address.
   Additionally, if Private Address and Global Address co-exist inside
   LSN, the ISP has to use Policy Based Routing (PBR).

5.2.2.  Address Block Duplication Issue

   The Private Address in ISP's network could conflict with its
   customer's network address.  Many CPEs between customer's network and
   ISP's network cannot route the packet under this situation.  To avoid
   this, ISP has to negotiate with its all customers not to use the
   reserved Private Address block.

5.3.  Class-E Address (240/4)

   It is known that some equipment such as routers and servers reject
   packets from or to this address block.  So, to use this address block
   in ISP's network, ISP has to request its customers to replace their
   equipment.  In addition to that, ISP might have to replace their
   equipment when it doesn't handle Class-E address packets properly.

Internet-Draft       NAT444 with ISP Shared Address           March 2009


5.4.  ISP Shared Address

   ISP Shared Address is the newly defined IPv4 address block that is to
   be allocated from IANA free pool.  It doesn't have any problem.
   Spending some blocks from the exhausting IANA free pool could be
   regarded as a problem, but from long view, this problem is much
   smaller than its great merit.  ISP Shared Address is defined in
   [I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr]


6.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks for the input and review by Shirou Niinobe, Takeshi Tomochika,
   Tomohiro Fujisaki, Dai Nishino, JP address community members, AP
   address community members and JPNIC members.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is to allocate a certain size of address block from IANA free
   pool.  The size of it is described in [I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr]


8.  Security Considerations

   Each customer inside a LSN looks using the same Global Address. from
   outside an ISP.  In case of incidents, the ISP must have the function
   to trace back the record of each customer's access without using only
   IP address.

   If a Global Address of the LSN is listed on the blacklist, other
   customers who share the same address could be affected.

Appendix A.  Example IPv6 Transition Scenario

   The steps of IPv6 transition are as follows.

   Step 1: Enabling softwire client in host

   ISP provides IPv6 connectivity to customers with softwire [RFC4925].
   ISP installs LSN and softwire concentrator in its network.  A
   softwire client in host connects to the IPv6 internet via ISP's
   concentrator.  ISP can use existing IPv4 equipments.  Customers can
   just use existing CPE.

   Step 2: Enabling softwire client in CPE

   A customer enables softwire client in CPE.  A softwire client in CPE
   connects to the IPv6 internet via ISP's concentrator.  A Customer's

   ISP provides dual stack access to CPE.  A CPE uplink is now dual
   stack.

Appendix B.  Example Architectures

   This section explains example architectures how to design NAT444 with
   ISP Shared Address.

B.1.  Direct Routing inside LSN

   This architecture enables direct communication between customers
   inside same LSN.  It has the following advantages.

   - The packets don't go through LSN.  (No hairpining)
   - The customers inside LSN can use bidirectional applications (e.g.
   TV Conference, VPN).
   - No need to use Policy Based Routing.

                 (The IPv4 Internet)
                          | Global Address
                     +----+----+
                     |   LSN   |
                     +----+----+
                          |
   ISP Shared +-----------+----------+ ISP Shared
      Address |      ..........      | Address
         +----+----+ :        : +----+----+
         | CPE NAT | :        : | CPE NAT |
         +----+----+ :        : +----+----+
      Private |      :        :      | Private
      Address |      v        v      | Address
         +----+----+            +----+----+
         |IPv4 Host|            |IPv4 Host|
         +---------+            +---------+

B.2.  LSN Bypassing

   This architecture is bypassing the NAT function of LSN.  It has the
   following advantage.

   - The customers inside an ISP can use bidirectional applications
   (e.g.  TV Conference, VPN).
   -Any communication in single ISP doesn't consume LSN external port.
   -ISP's servers outside LSN can access CPE. (e.g.  ICMP echo, SNMP,
   remote access)
   -ISP's servers outside LSN can distinguish which customer's
   connection it receives. (e.g.  DNS, Mail)

B.3.  Global Address Customers inside LSN

   This architecture enables co-existing Global Address and ISP Shared
   Address inside LSN.

   It enables direct communications from ISP Shared Address customer to
   Global Address customer inside same LSN.  It has the following
   advantage.

   - The ISP can put ISP Shared Address customer and Global Address
   customer in the same concentrator.
   - The packets don't go through LSN.  (No hairpining)
   - The customers inside LSN can use bidirectional applications (e.g.
   TV Conference, VPN).
   - No need to use Policy Based Routing.
