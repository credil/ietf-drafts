           Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules for IPv6
                    draft-raszuk-idr-flow-spec-v6-00

Abstract

   Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules [RFC5575] provides a
   protocol extension for propagation of traffic flow information for
   the purpose of rate limiting or filtering.  The [RFC5575] specifies
   those extensions for IPv4 protocol data packets.

   This specification extends the current [RFC5575] and defines changes
   to the original document in order to make it also usable and
   applicable to IPv6 data packets.

1.  Introduction

   The growing amount of IPv6 traffic in private and public networks
   requires the extension of tools used in the IPv4 only networks to be
   also capable of supporting IPv6 data packets.

   In this document authors analyze the differences of IPv6 [RFC2460]
   flows description from those of traditional IPv4 packets and propose
   subset of new encoding formats to enable Dissemination of Flow
   Specification Rules [RFC5575] for IPv6.

   This specification should be treated as an extension of base
   [RFC5575] specification and not its replacement.  It only defines the
   delta changes required to support IPv6 while all other definitions
   and operation mechanisms of Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules
   will remain in the main specification and will not be repeated here.


2.  IPv6 Flow Specification encoding in BGP

   The [RFC5575] defines a new SAFIs (133 for IPv4) and (134 for VPNv4)
   applications in order to carry corresponding to each such application
   flow specification.

   This document will redefine the [RFC5575] SAFIs in order to make them
   AFI specific and applicable to both IPv4 and IPv6 applications.

   The following changes are defined:

      "SAFI 133 for IPv4 dissemination of flow specification rules" to
      now be defined as "SAFI 133 for IP dissemination of flow
      specification rules"

      "SAFI 134 for VPNv4 dissemination of flow specification rules" to
      now be defined as "SAFI 134 for L3VPN dissemination of flow
      specification rules"

   For both SAFIs the indication to which address family they are
   referring to will be recognized by AFI value (AFI=1 for IPv4 or
   VPNv4, AFI=2 for IPv6 and VPNv6 respectively).  Such modification is
   fully backwards compatible with existing implementation and
   production deployments.

   It needs to be observed that such choice of proposed encoding is
   compatible with filter validation against routing reachability
   information as described in section 6 of RFC5575.  Validation tables
   will now be performed according to the following rules.

      Flow specification received over AFI/SAFI=1/133 will be validated
      against routing reachability received over AFI/SAFI=1/1

      Flow specification received over AFI/SAFI=1/134 will be validated
      against routing reachability received over AFI/SAFI=1/128

      Flow specification received over AFI/SAFI=2/133 will be validated
      against routing reachability received over AFI/SAFI=2/1

      Flow specification received over AFI/SAFI=2/134 will be validated
      against routing reachability received over AFI/SAFI=2/128


3.  IPv6 Flow Specification types changes

   The following component types are redefined or added for the purpose
   of accommodating new IPv6 header encoding.  Unless otherwise stated
   all other types as defined in RFC5575 apply to IPv6 packets as is.

   Type 1 - Destination IPv6 Prefix

      Encoding: <type (1 octet), prefix length (1 octet), prefix offset
      (1 octet), prefix>

      Defines the destination prefix to match.  Prefix offset has been
      defined to allow for flexible match on the part of the IPv6
      address where we want to skip (don't care) of N first bits of the
      address.  This can be especially useful where part of the IPv6
      address consists of embedded IPv4 address and match needs to
      happen only on the part of embedded IPv4 address.  The default
      value for prefix offset is 0x00 (match on all bits as indicated by
      prefix length).  Otherwise prefixes are encoded as in BGP UPDATE
      messages, a length in bits is followed by enough octets to contain
      the prefix information.

   Type 2 - Source IPv6 Prefix

      Encoding: <type (1 octet), prefix length (1 octet), prefix offset
      (1 octet), prefix>

      Defines the source prefix to match.  Prefix offset has been
      defined to allow for flexible match on the part of the IPv6
      address where we want to skip (don't care) of N first bits of the
      address.  This can be especially useful where part of the IPv6
      address consists of embedded IPv4 address and match needs to
      happen only on the part of embedded IPv4 address.  The default
      value for prefix offset is 0x00 (match on all bits as indicated by
      prefix length).  Otherwise prefixes are encoded as in BGP UPDATE

      messages, a length in bits is followed by enough octets to contain
      the prefix information.

   Type 3 - Next Header

      Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

      Contains a set of {operator, value} pairs that are used to match
      the Next Header value octet in IPv6 packets.  The operator byte is
      encoded as specified in component type 3 of [RFC5575].

   Type 11 - Traffic Class

      Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

      Contains a set of {operator, value} pairs that are used to match
      the Traffic Class 8-bit field [RFC2460] encoded in a single
      octet.The operator byte is encoded as specified in component type
      3 of [RFC5575].

   Type 11 - Fragment - Removed

      This type is removed for IPv6 flow specification as in IPv6
      fragmentation does not happen in the network.

   Type 13 - Flow Label - New type

      Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

      Contains a set of {operator, value} pairs that are used to match
      the 20-bit Flow Label field [RFC2460].The operator byte is encoded
      as specified in the component type 3 of [RFC5575].


4.  IPv6 Flow Specification Traffic Filtering Action changes

   One of the traffic filtering actions which can be expressed by BGP
   extended community is defined in [RFC5575] as traffic-marking.  This
   extended community type is of value: 0x8009.

   For the purpose of making it compatible with IPv6 header action
   expressed by presence of this extended community has been modified to
   read:

   Traffic Marking: The traffic marking extended community instructs a
   system to modify the Traffic Class bits of a transiting IPv6 packet
   to the corresponding value.  This extended community is encoded as a
   sequence of 5 zero bytes followed by the 8 bit Traffic Class value

Internet-Draft        draft-raszuk-idr-flow-spec-v6         January 2011


   encoded in the 6th byte.


5.  Security considerations

   No new security issues are introduced to the BGP protocol by this
   specification.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to rename currently defined SAFI 133 and SAFI 134
   per [RFC5575] to read:


   133     Dissemination of flow specification rules
   134     L3VPN dissemination of flow specification rules

   IANA is requested to create and maintain a new registry entitled:
   "Flow Spec IPv6 Component Types".  The following component types have
   been registered:


   Type 1 - Destination IPv6 Prefix
   Type 2 - Source IPv6 Prefix
   Type 3 - Next Header
   Type 4 - Port
   Type 5 - Destination port
   Type 6 - Source port
   Type 7 - ICMP type
   Type 8 - ICMP code
   Type 9 - TCP flags
   Type 10 - Packet length
   Type 11 - Traffic Class
   Type 12 - Reserved
   Type 13 - Flow Label
