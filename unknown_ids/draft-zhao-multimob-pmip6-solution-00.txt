2.  Introduction

   Multicast is a very important fundamention service.  It can be
   applied to support so many difference applications, such as IPTV,MBMS
   etc.Meanwhile,Proxy mobile IP is a technology to be provided to those
   hosts that didn't need MIP to do mobility management by network.So
   how to support multicast service for hosts used the proxy mobile IP
   protocol is needed to be designed and definitioned.
   draft-deng-multimob-pmip6-requirement-01.txt has discussed this kind
   of requirement.  In this draft, we will discuss how to meet those
   requirement and make the hosts with pmip protocol to support
   multicast.

4.  Overview

   To proxy mobile multicast protocol, we need to re-use those current
   existed mature protocols related to pmip and multicast as more as
   possible.  And keep the requirement of mobile node as simple as
   possible.  In this direction, it need to keep consistent with
   RFC5213.  The MAG can represent the MN to establish and maintenance
   the multicast service based on existed info provided by pre-config ,
   policy store, context transfer or even MN's request.And the multicast
   service can be terminated by MN,network policy or multicast service
   it self.

4.1.  Initiation of proxy mobile multicast service

   The mobile multicast service in proxy mobile IP domain can be
   initiated by both of network and mobile node.  They have the common
   handover process.  When it is initiated from mobile node, the MN will
   need to send IGMP/MLD to triggered MAG to start to establish the
   multicast service,Meanwhile, from those profile infomation or some
   pre-configured materials , MAG can just start the multicast service
   represent that Mobile node without the need of IGMP/MLD sent from
   Mobile node.  Becarefully, even in this case, Mobile node still can
   ask for join some multicast group, it is no any impact on that.

4.1.1.  Triggered from network

   In some multicast architecture, the MAG may initiate multicast
   subscription.In that case,the MAG will initiates multicast
   subscription and MN just sends IGMP to avoid the packet to be
   filtered by the OS; but IGMP is not sent to the network.  And if
   implementation support,MN can also didn't send MLD out to ask for
   join those related multicast group.

   When the MN just attachs to a MAG, the MAG gets the MN's profile and
   knows some pre-configured multicast services need to be established,
   then it will request the LMA to provide the respective service, in
   this case, the method used to communicate to LMA from MAG can be
   either PMIP signals or MLD report(join) messages etc.  LMA will check
   about this request and do the decision based on it's acknowledges
   about it.  The progress as the following:

4.1.2.  Triggered by mobile node

   If the mobile node knows some multicast groups should be joined , it
   can send MLD report to MAG about those target multicast groups it
   want to join in.

   In addition, if the mobile node has just received the MLD query from
   MAG, it can also response to it by MLD report including those
   multicast groups it want to receive.

   After receiving MLD report sent from MN,MAG will inform this to LMA/
   Multicast router.  But before that, MAG will do some related
   authorization or authentication to check about this request.

   Meanwhile,MAG didn't need to inform LMA/Multicast router about every
   request from MNs, it just inform LMA about those the firstest comer

   to some one multicast group.

4.2.  proxy mobile multicast service during handover

   Generally,without any optimization,the handover will need the
   involved of MNs by sending MLD report to inform new MAG about those
   multicast services they want to receive.

   But,for performance consideration,the CXT is expect to provide
   necessary multicast infomation during handover progress.  And if
   needed, a 3-rd party policy store is required to be used to provide
   necessary information whenever CXT will be used or not.

4.3.  Termination of proxy mobile multicast service

4.3.1.  Terminated from network

   When the schedule of some on-going multicast service is to the
   end,then the MAG can terminate to send those traffic to MNs whatever
   the multicast source is work or not.If no receiver of a multicast
   service under a MAG is existed, it will inform LMA about this event
   by related signals depend on which one is selected by LMA, for
   example, PBU/PBA,MLD leave message etc.

4.3.2.  Terminated by mobile node

   Mobile Node will send MLD leave message to inform MAG about the
   termination of a/some multicast service if he won't receive that
   service.After receiving that and finishing some necessary checkings
   for authorization or authentication , MAG will end to send that/those
   multicast services to MN again.  Respectly, if no one receiver of
   a/some multicast service under the MAG will be existed,MAG can inform
   LMA about this event by related signals depend on which one is
   selected by LMA, for example, PBU/PBA,MLD leave message etc.

5.  Mobile Access Gateway Operation

   To MAG, whether MN will run MLD protocol is not the key.  MAG should
   have the ability to interact with MN via MLD messages.And it also
   didn't need to ask MN must to send the MLD message for initiate or
   end a multicast service.Respectively, MAG can get related multicast
   infomation for particular MN from such as policy store, to initiate
   or terminate a multicast service.

   Meanwhile,MAG can disable all timers listening for MLD query if it
   has sent to MN.As to when the multicast should be ended, that will
   depend on related network policy and MN's interesting,and can be
   triggered from both of network and MN.

5.1.  Operated as MLD Proxy

   TBD.

5.2.  Operated as MLD Router

   TBD.

5.3.  Operated as MLD listener

   For route optimization reason, MAG should have the ability to join a
   Multicast group without the bi-direction tunnel between MAG and
   LMA.This can based a pre-configured configuration or MN's profile or
   a interaction between MAG and LMA.  But difference the possible
   multicast router in current design, the MAG no need so heavy
   implement to support it.  A MLD listener is enough.

6.  Local Mobility Anchor Operation

6.1.  Operated as MLD Proxy

   In pmipv6,every MAG and LMA will own a bi-direction tunnel.  There
   are only these two nodes on this tunnel.  Meanwhile, there are PBUs/
   PBAs are applicable for multicast group management.  In addition,
   since the tunnel between MAG and LMA can be multicast capable,IGMP/
   MLD can also be run in that tunnel.To one multicast group, MAG can
   only join once to LMA,it will save a lagre signal consumtion and
   including following multicast traffics invoide to make the tunnel to
   be involved the neck phenomenon.

   A MLD proxy can simplify the implementation of LMA, so that is a
   valued choice as well.The benefit is similiar to the description of
   MLD proxy located on MAG.

   To query those MAGs connected to a LMA,the LMA acting as an MLD proxy
   can use MLD Query messages or PBAs(Need some extensions) to inform
   those MAGs.After that, if LMA receives MLD Report messages or
   PBUs(Also need some extensions) from MAGs,it will forwards or send
   MLD Report messages to the multicast router it has connected with
   using it's link-local address.  That is belong to current regular
   multicast domain.

   As a MLD proxy, LMA need configure its upstream and downstream
   interfaces statistically.To downstream , it is connected those MAGs
   and to upstream , it is suggested a multicast router or maybe the
   multicast source is dedicated.  Since, there are some many difference
   prefixes located LMA,it can select only one or several interfaces
   owned for respective prefixes as the multicast listener interface
   face to upstream.

6.2.  Operated as MLD Router

   TBD.

7.  Mobile Node Consideration

7.1.  Operation without MLD

   After all, the MLD protocol need host to support and the
   transfermation of MLD protocol over air-interface will cost another
   consumetion.  In addition, the network have so many infomation can be
   referenced in some cases in pmip domian.  MAG can establish and
   maintenance the proxy mobile multicast service represent the MN.  So
   MN can just keep listening about the multicast traffic without send
   any expicite messages to MAG to manage the multicast service.

   It should be noted that, even if MLD report is not expected to be
   sent to the MAG many kernel implementation requires host's
   application to create/add joined multicast group membership structure
   inside its kernel and open device driver to capture the data whose IP
   multicast address is the specified one.

   If no such operation, the host must receive all multicast data with
   promiscuous mode, which is worst and not willing to any host.

   To this case, one hand,this mode is applicable to those hosts that
   didn't support MLD protocol.In addition, to those support MLD hosts
   it will rely on the management of MAG.  Since the link mode is p2p
   link. the MN is only connected to MAG on like.  So it require the MAG
   just control to send which kind of multicast services and send what
   to this mobile node.  In another hand, to p2p link, what will be the
   promiscuous mode?  Since all of data need to be received by hosts,
   and MAG just kick off those service that not related to that MN.So,it
   will be not worst in pmip case.

8.  Protocol compitable considerations

   By the introduction of difference roles of MAG and LMA, the co-
   ordination between the differentiate type of p-MAG and n-MAG is a
   requirement.  But, of course, we can pre-defined or advice to
   operators to only deploy one type of function (MLD Proxy/MLD Router
   etc) inside of MAG or LMA.  That can make both of this protocol and
   PMIPv6 domain as simple as possible.  If we can make this assumtion,
   then a negotiation will be needed.  Here we can utilize CXT or policy
   store to do this.  And a dual-mode MAG will be required to be
   operated in different method.

8.1.  negotiation during handover

   TBD.
