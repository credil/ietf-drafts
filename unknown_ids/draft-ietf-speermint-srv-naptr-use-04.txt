Internet-Draft   DNS SRV and NAPTR Records for SPEERMINT   November 2008


1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   A service provider needs to identify the ingress Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) (RFC 3261 [RFC3261]) server of a peering network
   before it can signal and route SIP-based real-time communications
   sessions.  This function of locating the ingress SIP server of a
   peering network is typically performed by the egress SIP server of
   the service provider originating the SIP session.  Also, the ingress
   server in the peering network needs to locate the originating service
   provider's egress server in situations where the peering connection
   is terminated after receiving a SIP request or if the egress SIP
   server of originating service provider fails.  The SIP servers at the
   originating and peering sides use DNS [NEED REFERENCE HERE]
   procedures, using both SRV [RFC3261] and NAPTR [RFC3404] records, in
   order to locate each other.


3.  Session Peering Setup

   SIP systems are represented by user agents (UA).  The diagram below
   shows the case of direct peering where a user agent (UA1), hosted by
   a service provider (SP1), initiates a SIP session to a User Agent
   (UA2), hosted by another service provider (SP2).  The egress SIP
   server of SP1 is a SIP signaling path border element (SBE) as defined
   in section 3 of [SPEERMINT-Terminology] [VERIFY SECTION NUMBER IN
   REFERENCE], called SBE1, that interfaces with session peering service
   provider SP2.  The SIP session initiated by UA1 is received by this
   network element, SBE1.  The resource to which the SIP request needs
   to be routed by SBE1 is identified by a SIP or SIPS URI.  For
   example, this could be the SIP URI of UA2 found in the Request-URI of
   the SIP request received by SBE1.  Alternatively, for example, this
   could also be the next hop from SBE1 found in the topmost Route
   header of SIP request.  In order to determine the resource to route
   the request to, SP1 MAY make use of ENUM [RFC3761] lookup services or
   some other internal lookup to determine the SIP URI of the resource.
   Such an ENUM lookup service may use e164.arpa or one or more other
   private ENUM zones.  This lookup MAY be performed by SBE1 or another
   network element of SP1.

                                 Figure 1

   In order to route the SIP request to this resource in SP2, SBE1 needs
   to determine the ingress SIP signaling path border element for SP2,
   called SBE2, by resolving the SIP or SIPS URI using DNS.  SBE1 makes
   use of the NAPTR and DNS SRV mechanism defined in [RFC3263] to
   determine the IP address, port, and transport protocol for peering
   with the SP2 ingress SIP proxy server (i.e.  SBE2).  SBE1 and SBE2
   which are involved in the session peering, support a set of protocols
   and have list of preferences for these protocols.  UDP, TCP and TLS
   MUST be supported by these proxies {PER JOHN ELWELL, EXAMINE THE MUST
   STATEMENT, CONSIDER REWORDING].

   As a best current practice, SBE1 and SBE2 SHOULD be deployed in a
   highly scalable and highly available manner, such as a cluster of
   servers.  These servers are of different prioritization and weight,
   to ensure capacity-based load balancing.  [THIS LAST SENTENCE NEEDS
   TO BE REWORDED]

   The figure below shows the case of indirect/transit peering where
   SBE2 is the ingress SIP server of a transit service provider [DOUBLE
   CHECK AGAINST TERM I-D, ADD REFERENCE].  The mechanism to locate SBE2
   is the same as described for direct peering scenario.

                                 Figure 2

   The figure below shows a high level SIP call flow setting up a direct
   SIP peering session between SP1 and SP2.  In this call flow a VoIP
   session is established between a caller, Bob (sip:bob@example1.com),
   in SP1 and callee, Alice(sip:alice@example2.com), in SP2 using SIP
   INVITE request.  All SIP signaling MUST go through both SBE1 and
   SBE2, as these are the ingress and egress points in SP1 and SP2
   networks, respectively.

   [Q: DO WE NEED A CALL FLOW FOR INDIRECT PEERING?]

   [PROBABLY NEED A SUB-SECTION NUMBER PRIOR TO NEXT SENTENCE, AND NEED
   TO EXPAND IT WITH MORE TEXT]

   The target, to which the request is sent, is determined by SBE1 as
   follows:

Internet-Draft   DNS SRV and NAPTR Records for SPEERMINT   November 2008


3.1.  Target Determination

   The target resource is identified with a SIP or SIPS URI.  This is
   the URI in the Route header, if present, or the URI from the request
   URI of the SIP request received by SBE1.  The host value of the
   hostport component of the URI is the TARGET [VERIFY / CLARIFY AS
   NEEDED].  This TARGET is the domain to be contacted.  The NAPTR/SRV/A
   resource record lookup as described in the following section should
   be skipped if the transport/port/IP address is already specified for
   the target URI.

3.2.  NAPTR Lookup

   Next, SBE1 determines the transport protocol of the TARGET, SBE2, by
   performing a NAPTR query for the TARGET.  NAPTR processing as
   described in [RFC2915] will result in the discovery of the most
   preferred transport protocol [CONSIDER REWORDING / VALIDATE PREVIOUS
   3 WORDS] of a server instance of SBE2 and SRV records.

   Considering our example call flow above [INCL LOCAL REFERENCE HERE],
   SBE1 wishes to resolve sip:alice@example2.com and performs a NAPTR
   query for that TARGET domain example2.com, and the following NAPTR
   records are returned:

   ;         order   pref  flags   service         regexp   replacement
   IN NAPTR  50  50  "s"    "SIPS+D2T"   ""  _sips._tcp.example2.com
   IN NAPTR  90  50  "s"    "SIP+D2T"    ""  _sip._tcp.example2.com
   IN NAPTR 100  50  "s"    "SIP+D2U"    ""  _sip._udp.example2.com

                                 Figure 4

   DNS MUST return at least three records - one with "SIP+D2T", one with
   "SIP+D2U" and one with "SIPS+D2T" service type for the case of direct
   and indirect peering (section 4.3 in [SPEERMINT-Terminology]).  For
   indirect (transit) peering (section 4.4 in [SPEERMINT-Terminology])
   since domain validation as specified in section 26.3.2.2 of [RFC3261]
   for TLS at layer 5 will not work, SIPS over TLS cannot be used.
   [CONSIDER EXPANSION OF THIS SECTION]

3.3.  SRV Lookup

   Depending on what transport protocols SBE1 supports, SBE1 selects one
   from the preference list of NAPTR results and performs the SRV lookup
   to obtain a list of available server instances for SBE2.  TLS SHOULD
   be the preferred transport protocol for peering between SBE1 and
   SBE2.

   In our example, SBE1 uses TCP, the SRV lookup for _sip._tcp.sp2.com

   Alternatively, if no NAPTR records are found, then SBE1 uses the
   preferred transport protocol and issues an SRV query for that
   specific transport using "sips" for SIPS URI and SIP URI with TLS and
   "sip" for SIP URI as the SRV domain prefix.

   In our example, SBE1 prefers to use TCP and target SIP URI of SP2 is
   sip:alice@example2.com, it sends a SRV query for
   _sip._tcp.example2.com.

   The SRV responses MAY also include A records with it.

3.4.  Using SRV Results

   If A records are not returned with the SRV responses, procedures from
   RFC 2782 [NEED XML REFERENCE HERE] describes how to use and interpret
   the results obtained from the SRV query.  The target entry of the SRV
   RRs is looked up by querying the DNS for address records.  If the SRV
   response from DNS includes A records with it, it will cut down on
   round trips and lookup of DNS again for target entry.  On determining
   the transport protocol, service, port and address record from the SRV
   RRs as described above, the SBE1 will try to connect to the
   (protocol, address, service).  Once the connection is established to
   an available instance of SBE2, SBE1 sends the SIP request to SBE2.
   SBE1 MUST act in a stateful manner and any retransmission of SIP
   requests for a specific SIP transaction, including ACKS for non-2xx
   response or CANCEL for that SIP transaction MUST go to the same
   server instance of SBE2.

   When SBE1 sends the SIP request to SBE2, it SHOULD set the sent-by
   parameter of the topmost Via header in the SIP request to a domain
   that identifies SBE1.  It MUST NOT specify the port.

   [WG QUESTION: SHOULD THE ABOVE SENTENCE SAY MUST NOT OR SOMETHING
   ELSE?]


4.  High Availability

   High Availability is ensured by detecting failures in the ability to
   connect to SBE1 and SBE2 server instances.  In the event of a

   failure, when SBE1 tries to send SIP INVITE to SBE2, the following
   failures could occur:

4.1.  SBE1 Fails to Reach SBE2

   A 503 error response is reported by the transaction layer, or failure
   can occur at the transport layer due to TCP disconnect in connection,
   ICMP error in UDP or time out at transport layer or SIP layer timeout
   when its not receiving any SIP response.  In such situations, SBE1
   tries a new SIP request transaction to the next available server
   instance of SBE2 as determined by SRV RRs entry.  The SIP T1 timer on
   SBE1 SHOULD be configurable with a upper limit value of 500ms.  A
   shorter value of T1, say 100ms, reflects a faster fail-over support.

4.2.  Using SRV Results

   Failure may also occur after the request is received by SBE2 from
   SBE1 due to closure of the transport connection the request came in
   on at SBE2, before the response can be sent back to SBE1.  In this
   situation, SBE2 uses the domain value present in the 'sent-by'
   parameter in the top most Via header of the received SIP INVITE, and
   queries for SRV records at this domain name using the service
   identifier "_sips" if the Via transport is "TLS", "_sip" otherwise.
   The sorted list of SRV RRs are obtained and used as described in
   [RFC2782] to send the response back to SBE1.  If the topmost element
   in the list of server instances of SBE1 fails, the next available one
   is tried.

   [FOR NEXT REV: SHOULD WE ADD CALL FLOW FOR FAILURE SCENARIO DESCRIBED
   IN 4.1 AND 4.2]


5.  Caching/TTL

5.1.  Caching

   SBE SHOULD use caching of DNS results to eliminate unnecessary DNS
   queries.

5.2.  TTL

   SRV RRs have a TTL value based on which the SBE1 caches the entry for
   that duration, if it supports caching, and any further requests to
   the same TARGET domain are delivered to the cached server instance.
   The TTL recommended for SRV is about 1 hr.  The TTL for NAPTR is much
   higher, about 1 day (24hrs) since the NAPTR records do not vary that
   often as compared to SRV.
