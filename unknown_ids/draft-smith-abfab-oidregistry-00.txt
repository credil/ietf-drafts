Internet-Draft               ABFAB Use Cases                   June 2011


1.  Introduction

   IANA has assigned the IETF ABFAB working group an OID arc of
   1.3.6.1.5.5.15 (iso.org.dod.internet.security.mechanisms.abfab).  The
   goal of this document is to catalogue usage within the arc and the
   procedures for IANA to use to control the arc after the ABFAB working
   group has handed the arc over.

2.  OID Registry

2.1.  IANA Arc

   OIDs in usage under this arc are to be passed to IANA when the ABFAB
   working group deems the arc sufficiently mature.  This list is
   intended to be exhaustive.

   Obviously TODO as we have no usage yet...

      0   Reserved      Reserved

2.2.  Other Arcs

   There are also OIDs in usage under other private arcs.  These are not
   intended to be passed to IANA, but are temporarily recorded here,
   purely for completeness.  This subsection is intended to be removed
   for the final version of this I-D.  Note that this list may not be
   exhaustive.  TODO - remove this section before final draft.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TODO.

   All applications for assigned numbers under the ABFAB OID arc should
   be reviewed.  TODO - Review process?  TODO - Mailing list?  Guidance
   to IANA if not review process?
