Internet-Draft   IANA Registration for Enumservice 'iax'    January 2011


1.  Introduction

   The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) [RFC3986] Dynamic
   Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM)
   [I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis] transforms E.164 [E164] numbers into Uniform
   Resource Identifiers (URIs) using the Domain Name System (DNS)
   [RFC1035].

   IAX (Inter-Asterisk eXchange) [RFC5456] is an "all in one" protocol
   for handling multimedia in IP networks.  It combines both control and
   media services in the same protocol.

   This document registers an Enumservice for the IAX [RFC5456] protocol
   according to the guidelines given in
   draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].

Internet-Draft   IANA Registration for Enumservice 'iax'    January 2011


3.1.  Simple IAX Registration

   The following is an example of the use of the Enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record.

     $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.

     @     IN NAPTR ( 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax"
                  "!^.*$!iax:example.com/chas!" .   )

   This contact information indicates that service identified by the
   "+442079460148" E.164 number can be accessed using the IAX protocol
   to domain 'example.com'.  The called party, service, or program on
   that domain is identified by 'chas'.

3.2.  Registration with Multiple Priorities

   The next example demonstrates that service identified by the
   "+441632960083" E.164 number is preferably accessed by IAX, secondly
   via SIP [RFC3764], thirdly by H.323 [RFC3762] for voice and general
   commmunication, and lastly by SMTP for messaging.  Note that the
   tokens "iax", "SIP", "H323", and "email" are types registered with
   IANA, and they have no implicit connection with the protocols or URI
   schemes with the same names.

   In each case, the next step in the resolution process is to use the
   resolution mechanism appropriate to each of the protocols (specified
   by the URI schemes iax, sip, h323, and mailto).

     $ORIGIN 3.8.0.0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.

     @    IN NAPTR ( 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax"
                 "!^.*$!iax:example.com/mccarthy!" . )

     @    IN NAPTR ( 10 101 "u" "E2U+SIP"
                 "!^.*$!sip:mccarthy@example.com!" . )

     @    IN NAPTR ( 10 102 "u" "E2U+H323"
                 "!^.*$!h323:mccarthy@example.com!" . )

     @    IN NAPTR ( 10 103 "u" "E2U+email:mailto"
                 "!^.*$!mailto:mccarthy@example.com!" . )

3.3.  Registration with an IAX context

   The following is an example of the use of the Enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record that contains a
   destination 'context'.

Internet-Draft   IANA Registration for Enumservice 'iax'    January 2011


     $ORIGIN 9.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.

     @     IN NAPTR ( 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax"
                  "!^.*$!iax:example.com/joe?developers!" )

   This contact information indicates that +442079460149 may be
   contacted by using the IAX protocol at domain 'example.com' with the
   called party 'joe' in the context (or user partition) 'developers'.
   See Section 2 of [RFC5456].

3.4.  IPv6 Registration

   The following is an example of the use of the Enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record that contains an IPV6
   destination address.

   $ORIGIN 9.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.

   @     IN NAPTR ( 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax"
                  "!^.*$!iax:[2001:db8::1]:4569/alice?friends!"  . )

   This contact information indicates that +442079460149 may be
   contacted by using the IAX protocol at IPv6 address 2001:db8::1, port
   4569 with the called party 'alice' in the context (or user partition)
   'friends'.


4.  Security Considerations

   The 'iax' Enumservice does not introduce any new security issues
   beyond any already present in the ENUM, DNS and IAX protocols except
   that this Enumservice provides for disclosure of information that may
   facilitate an attack or a violation of user privacy in some way.  The
   primary result of these exploits is unwanted communications.  These
   issues are discussed in further detail in [RFC3833].

   The use of DNSSEC [RFC4035] is recommended to improve operational
   security.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests registration of the 'iax' Enumservice
   according to the guidelines and specifications in
   draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide]
   and the definitions in Section 2 in this document.

6.  DNS Considerations

   DNS considerations related to the 'iax' Enumservice are similar to
   those of the 'SIP' Enumservice.

   Misconfiguration or delays in zone changes can result in call loops,
   perhaps with different protocols or networks.  Implementations should
   take care to ensure such loops can be detected without interrupting
   other services including SIP-based, IAX-based, and DNS itself.

8.  Draft Changes

   [Note to RFC-Editor: This section is to be removed before publishing.
   XML source is available upon request.]

8.1.  Changes since draft-ietf-enum-iax-06

   * KD: Changed title from "IANA Registration for IAX Enumservice" to
   "IANA Registration for Enumservice 'iax'" as the service type is in
   small letters

   * KD: Changed introduction (ENUM maps to URIs, not domains) - used
   wording from Enumservices draft [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].

   * KD: Changed introduction: shortened IAX description - this RFC is
   not about IAX but about the ENUM service.

   * KD: Changed introduction: shortend description (the service field
   actually does not describe the class of functionality, but is mostly
   a pointer to supported communication protocols)

   * KD: Use the same wording in abstract and introduction: The
   Enumservice is not IAX but iax, thus used different wording.

   * KD: Fixed double-spaces

   * KD: IANA Registration: changed functional description: fixed
   wording, use 'communication' instead of 'call origination'

   * KD: IANA Registration: remove reference to URI registry (no clean

   way to reference) and moved reference to [RFC5456] one paragraph up

   * KD: Todo: Fix references "thisRFC" in IANA Registration

   * KD: Registration with multiple priorities: write "SIP", "H323" for
   the tokens, instead of "sip", "h323" and add 'mailto' to the
   protocols

   * KD: Examples: replaced "This contact information indicates that the
   domain 9.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa. may be contacted" with
   "This contact information indicates that +442079460149 may be
   contacted" as a domain is not contacted (although the previous text
   was from the ENUM RFC)

   * KD: Examples: Write IPv6 address in text without [] as the port is
   mentioned separately

   * KD: IANA Considerations: removed the sub-type as we do not register
   a sub-type

   * KD: DNS Considerations: removed "Since IAX is typically deployed in
   a proxy configuration" as there is no "proxy" configuration in IAX

   * KD: DNS Considerations: removed reference to [RFC4759] as IMO it
   does not solve the loop problem on DNS changes and chached data (it
   does not even contain the word 'loop')

   * KD: Security Considerations: removed reference to RFC 4035
   regarding "unwanted communication" as DNSSEC is here not relevant.

   * KD: as suggested by Bernie: fixed references to RFC3761bis and
   draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide

   * KD: as suggested by Bernie: verified that all example numbers are
   UK drama numbers (http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/
   numbering/guidance-tele-no/numbers-for-drama) and 2001:db8::1 is a
   "documentation" IPv6 address

   * KD: as suggested by Bernie: replaced "Editor" with "RFC-Editor"

   * KD: Acknowledgments: added Bernie

8.2.  Changes since draft-ietf-enum-iax-05

   * Changed to be compatible with [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].

   * Added DNS Considerations section.

   * Per Dan Harkin's review, improved language in security
   considerations section and fixed typo.

   * Per Peter Koch's review, change DNS continuation character from \
