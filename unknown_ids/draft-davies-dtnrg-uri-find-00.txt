Internet-Draft       Adding find opname to dtn: URI         October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the addition of an extra operation to the
   proposed dtn: URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) scheme documented in
   [I-D.irtf-dtnrg-dtn-uri-scheme].

   The purpose of the "find" operation is to allow DTN nodes to access
   services that they do not or cannot support through exchange of DTN
   bundles.  In the spirit of DTN operation, nodes expect to be able to
   operate independently and may not know exactly where such a service
   is implemented, but has a reasonable expectation that such a service
   is provided by another node accessible using DTN.

   In order for the "find" operation to work satisfactorily, the routing
   service, whether static or dynamic, would need to collect and
   propagate information about the "services" offered by the nodes to
   which it was able to route bundles.  With the help of this
   information, the DTN routing system could offer a form of "anycast"
   service that delivered appropriately addressed bundles to one or more
   nodes that offer the services requested in the "find" adressing
   format.  Especially in the dynamic case, service announcements will
   need to be propagated in the DTN network.  The mechanism to be used
   to provide these announcements requires further study.  Where
   services are provided by gateway nodes at the edge of the Internet
   static configuration in some DTN nodes may be sufficient.


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Changes to "dtn" Scheme Syntax and Rules

3.1.  Syntax

   The general syntax of a dtn URI as defined in
   [I-D.irtf-dtnrg-dtn-uri-scheme] is unchanged except for the addition
   of "find" to opname.  The revised ABNF [RFC5234] is:

   dtnURI = "dtn:" ("none" / nontrivialSSP)

   where:

   nontrivialSSP = dtnURIelt *("!" dtnURIelt)

Internet-Draft       Adding find opname to dtn: URI         October 2009


   dtnURIelt = [opname] ":" URI ; URI as defined in RFC 3986 [*]

   opname = "push" / "pop" / "next" / "flood" / "exec"/ "find"

3.2.  Changes to Resolution of DTN Endpoint IDs

   Section 2.2 of [I-D.irtf-dtnrg-dtn-uri-scheme] contains defintions of
   the various operations listed under "opname" in the ABNF.  For the
   "find" operation the following definition should be added after
   thedefinition of "exec":

   find:  When the operation name is "find", the bundle agent SHOULD use
      information accumulated by the DTN routing system in use to
      forward the bundle towards one or more nodes that are able to
      deliver the requested service or would be better able to forward
      the bundle towards such a node.  However, the node MAY determine
      that it is able to deliver the bundle locally to an agent that can
      provide the requested service: in this case the operation is
      equivalent to the "pop" operation.  If the node is unable to
      determine a suitable target it MAY drop the bundle.


4.  Examples

4.1.  dtn:find:mailto:another@example.org,second@example.org

   Citing this EID as the destination of a bundle causes the bundle to
   be delivered to a node that provides an (outgoing) email server that
   can forward the payload of the bundle as an email to the specified
   address(es) in the mailto URI or local account(s) to which the email
   can be delivered.  In this case the bundle payload is expected to
   contain one or more emails in [RFC2822] format.

4.2.  dtn:find:service:printer?printer-color-supported=true

   Citing this EID as the destination of a bundle causes the bundle to
   be delivered to a node that provides a printing service.  The
   specified attribute requests that a color capable printer be used to
   print the payload carried in the bundle.  This example uses the
   service: URI template "printer.2.0.en"
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/svrloc-templates/printer.2.0.en>
   that conforms to the specification in [RFC2609].

4.3.  dtn:find:service:fax?destination=+4416324960123

   Citing this EID as the destination of a bundle is intended to cause
   the bundle to be delivered to a node that provides a telephone
   facsimile (fax) service.  Note that this would require the definition

   of a new service: URI template for a fax delivery service which
   provided the "destination" attribute that would be the telephone
   number called.  The payload of the bundle would be sent as a fax to
   the specified destination.

4.4.  dtn:find:service:httpproxy:http://example.com/
      somepage.html?depth=3

   Citing this EID as the destination of a bundle is intended to cause
   the bundle to be delivered to a node that provides a (caching) web
   proxy service.  As with the previous example, this proposes the use
   of a yet-to-be created service: URI template for a web proxy service
   that would access the specified URI using the HTTP protocol.
   Typically the HTML in the page returned from the initial request
   would require additional accesses to build up the entire displayed
   page (c.f., the GNU "wget" tool that returns content from web servers
   <http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>).  The "depth" parameter controls
   the depth of recursion of such accesses.  The suite of returned HTML
   documents would be combined into a single bundle that would be
   returned to the requestor.  The complete service would provide
   additional parameters to control the behavior of the service and
   possibly cause repeated operation on a timed basis.

4.5.  dtn:find:service:httpproxy:http:?telephone+number+example,
      &width=5,&depth=3

   This example is similar to the previous example in Section 4.4,
   except that the intention is to have the service access a suitable
   web search engine (to be chosen by the service provider) to look up
   information according to the query (in this case information about
   example numbers to be used when describing a telephone service) with
   parameters that control the number of returned results (&width
   parameter) to be examined in more detail by accessing the returned
   URIs recursively to the value of the &depth parameter.  Again the
   complete set of results would be returned as a single bundle and
   additional parameters could be defined.

4.6.  dtn:find:intent#
      role(?E,coffee),location(?E,Loc),within(100,(1,3),Loc)

   The concept of intentional naming is described in
   [I-D.pbasu-dtnrg-naming].  An example of the naming scheme used with
   the GRAIN (Gradient-Based Algorithm for Intentional Naming)
   salgorithm to locate nodes that satisfy the intentional naming
   specification is given at the end of Section 5.5 of the draft.  The
   mechanism needs additional support from the dtn: URI scheme to be
   usable in a DTN network.  We suggest that the "find" operation could
   be used in the way illustrated in this example to direct bundles to

   appropriate nodes using an intentional naming scheme.  We also note
   that it would also be possible to specify the intentional naming
   mechanism through a service: URI service template which would allow
   it to be used in the wider Internet instead of defined a separate
   "intent" URI scheme restricted to DTN.


5.  Security Considerations

   The addition of the "find" operation does not appear to introduce any
   extra security issues beyind the considerable challenges already
   facing DTN security.


6.  IANA Considerations

   It is intended that the "find" operation will be folded into the dtn:
   URI scheme being defined in [I-D.irtf-dtnrg-dtn-uri-scheme] which
   will be registered in the URI registry defined in [RFC4395].

   The "find" operation expects to use URIs following the service: URI
   scheme ([RFC2609]) and possibly other existing schemes.  It may
   require the definition of new service templates according to the
   service: URI definition.
