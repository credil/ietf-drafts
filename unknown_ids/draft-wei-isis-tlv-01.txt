                    New TLV for Purge Packet in ISIS
                         draft-wei-isis-tlv-01

Abstract

   At present the purge packet does not contain information of the
   source router generating it.  Thus under the circumstance of purge
   packet propagation, it is difficult to tracback and locate the source
   router.

   To address the problem, this document proposes to add a new TLV in
   purge packet to record the system ID of the IS generating it.  This
   TLV should not be changed in purge packets sent by other routers.

Internet-Draft      New TLV for Purge Packet in ISIS          March 2010


1.  Introduction

   ISIS [ISO 10589] routing protocol has been widely used large-scale IP
   networks because of its strong scalability and fast speed of
   convergence.  ISIS is a kind of link-state routing protocols by
   flooding the LSP to advertise route network widely.

   When router A receives a corrupted LSP from router B, which may be
   caused by router B or the link between them, router A should generate
   a corruptedLSPReceived event and then discard the corrupted LSP
   according to [ISO 10589].

   Some implementations, however, will remove routes to router B,
   generate purge packet and flood it to the whole network.  The purge
   packet informs other routers in the network that the LSP is wrong and
   the route to router B is not reachable.  Other routers receiving the
   purge packet will do the same operation: delete the route and flood
   the purge packet.  The route will be recovered until router B
   generates a new LSP to inform the whole network. if again, the LSP is
   damaged when it receives Router A, the above procedure will repeat
   and the whole network will flap.  Such phenomenon was observed in
   China Mobile's network consisting of hundreds of routers in 20007, 5
   years after the publication of [ISO 10589].

   ISIS protocol is vulnerable to purge packet propagation.  And it has
   no mechanism to trackback and locate the source when purge packet
   propagation does occure in the network.  To address this problem,
   this document proposes to add a new TLV in purge packet to record the
   system ID of the router generating it.

3.  Cases to generate purge packet

   The legitimate purge cases:

   (1)Originating IS purges its own LSP.

   (2)LSP owned by another IS ages out.

   (3)A new DIS is elected.

   The inappropriate purge cases:

   (1)An implementation misunderstanding [ISO 10589] generates purge
   packet when it receives corrupted LSP.

   (2)An implementation with bugs tries to self-purge and makes some
   truly egregious mistakes.

   (3)An implementation fails to retain the LSP header after purging
   while flooding is still in progress.

4.  Proposed New TLV in Purge Packet

   This document proposes a new TLV for purge packet, which records the
   system ID of the IS generating the purge packet.  This kind of TLV
   SHOULD not be changed in purge packets sent by other routers than the
   initiator.

   The purpose to introduce this kind of TLV is to taceback and locate
   the source IS that initiates the purge packet when purge packet
   propagation occures in the network, which is usually caused by the
   inappropriate cases mentioned in above section of this document.
   This method is useful in both lab and field network.  It is helpful
   for both developers and network operators.

   The new TLV is:

   CODE - XX (to be assigned)

   LENGTH - total length of the value field.

   VALUE - System ID of the Intermediate System that initiates the Purge
   packet
