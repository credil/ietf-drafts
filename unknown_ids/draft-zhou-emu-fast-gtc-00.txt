Abstract

   The flexible authentication via secure tunneling EAP method (EAP-
   FAST) enables secure communication between a client and a server by
   using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a mutually
   authenticated tunnel.  Within this tunnel a basic password exchange,
   based on the generic token card method (EAP-GTC), may be executed to
   authenticate the peer.

Internet-Draft            EAP-FAST with EAP-GTC              August 2007


1.  Introduction

   EAP-FAST [RFC4851] is an EAP method that can be used to mutually
   authenticate peer and server.  This document describes the inner EAP
   method used by EAP-FAST to carry out a basic password exchange, based
   on EAP-GTC, to authenticate the user.  EAP-GTC, described in
   [RFC3748], was chosen due to its versatility and simplicity.  Message
   exchanges, including user credentials, are in clear text strings, but
   within the encrypted TLS tunnel and thus are considered secure.  All
   EAP-GTC packets sent within the TLS tunnel must be encapsulated in
   EAP-Payload TLVs.

1.1.  Specification Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  EAP-FAST GTC authentication

   All EAP-GTC packets used in EAP-FAST must follow the "LABEL=Value"
   format.  For instance, the server request MUST be in the form of
   "REQUEST=please enter your password." and peer response MUST be in
   the form of "RESPONSE=user@example.com\0secret", where
   "user@example.com" is the user identity, "secret" is the user
   password, and "\0" is the NULL character to separate user name and
   password.  If the peer or the server receive EAP-GTC request or
   response not in the format specified, it should fail the
   authentication by sending Result TLV with a failure.

   After the TLS encryption tunnel is established and EAP-FAST
   Authentication Phase 2 starts, the EAP Server sends an EAP-GTC
   Request, which contains a server challenge, often with a displayable
   message for the user prompt.

   A peer may prompt the user for the user credentials, or decide to use
   the user credentials gained through some other means without
   prompting the user.  The peer sends the user credentials back in the
   EAP-GTC Response using the following format:

   "RESPONSE=user@example.com\0secret"

   where "user@example.com" is the actual user name and "secret" is the
   actual password.  The NULL character is used to separate the user
   name and password.

   The inclusion of both username and secret in a single message is to
   achieve optimization by eliminating the inner method EAP-Identity and
   save an extra round trip by peer sending both use name and password
   in the first response packet.

   Once the EAP-FAST Server receives the user credentials, it SHOULD
   first validate the user identity with the I-ID in the PAC-Opaque and
   if it matches, it will continue to authenticate the user with
   internal or external user databases.

   Additional exchanges may occur between the EAP-FAST server and peer
   to facilitate various user authentications.  The EAP-FAST Server
   might send additional challenges to the peer for additional
   information, such as password change or new pin mode in the OTP
   [RFC2289] case.  The peer may prompt the user again and send back the
   needed information in EAP-GTC Response.

   If the EAP-FAST server finishes authentication, it will proceed to
   Protected Termination as described in [RFC4851].

Internet-Draft            EAP-FAST with EAP-GTC              August 2007


   An EAP-GTC server implementation within EAP-FAST uses the following
   format if an authentication fails:

       "E=eeeeeeeeee R=r C=cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc M=<msg> "

   where

   The "eeeeeeeeee" is the ASCII representation of a decimal error code
   corresponding to one of those listed below, though implementations
   should deal with codes not on this list gracefully.  The error code
   need not be 10 digits long.

   Below are some pre-defined error codes:

        646 ERROR_RESTRICTED_LOGON_HOURS
        647 ERROR_ACCT_DISABLED
        648 ERROR_PASSWD_EXPIRED
        649 ERROR_NO_DIALIN_PERMISSION
        691 ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE
        709 ERROR_CHANGING_PASSWORD
        755 ERROR_PAC_I-ID-NO_MATCH

   The "r" is a single character ASCII flag set to '1' if a retry is
   allowed, and '0' if not.  When the EAP server sets this flag to '1'
   it disables short timeouts, expecting the peer to prompt the user for
   new credentials and resubmit the response.

   The <msg> is human-readable text in the appropriate character set and
   language [RFC2484].

   The "cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc" is the ASCII representation of
   a hexadecimal challenge value.  This field is reserved for future
   use.

   The error format described above is similar to what are defined in
   MSCHAPv2 [RFC2759], except for the server challenge.  So if the EAP-
   FAST Server is distributing MSCHAPV2 exchanges to the backend inner
   method server, it can simply just return what the backend inner
   method server returns.  In the case of connecting to an OTP or LDAP
   [RFC4511] server, the EAP-FAST Server can format the error message
   into this format and define some additional error codes.  With the
   addition of the retry count, peer can potentially prompt the user for
   new credentials to try again without restarts the EAP-FAST
   authentication from the beginning.  Peer will respond to the error
   code with another EAP-GTC Response with either the new Username and
   Password or in case of other unrecoverable failures, an empty EAP-GTC
   packet for acknowledgement.

   In the case of an unrecoverable EAP-GTC authentication failure, the
   EAP server can send a GTC error code as described above, along with
   the Result TLV for protected termination.  This way, no extra round
   trips will occur.  The peer can acknowledge the GTC failure as well
   as the Result TLV within the same EAP-FAST packet.  Once server
   receives the acknowledgement, the TLS tunnel will be torn down and a
   clear text EAP-Failure will be sent.

   The username and password, as well as server challenges MAY support
   non-ASCII characters.  In this case, International username,
   password, and messages are based on the use of Unicode characters,
   encoded as UTF-8 and processed with a certain algorithm to ensure a
   canonical representation.  The input should be processed according to
   [RFC4282] Section 2.4.

   Since EAP-GTC doesn't generate session keys, the ISK used for crypto-
   binding for EAP-FAST will be filled with all zeros.

3.  Security Considerations

   The EAP-GTC method sends password information in the clear and MUST
   NOT be used outside of a protected tunnel such as the one provided by
   EAP-FAST.  In addition, the peer SHOULD authenticate the server
   before disclosing its credentials.  Since EAP-FAST with anonymous
   provisioning does not authenticate the server, EAP-GTC MUST NOT be
   used for anonymous provisioning mode.  EAP-GTC can only be used with
   EAP-FAST provisioning mode if server authentication is performed.

4.  IANA Considerations

   EAP-GTC has already been assigned the value of 6.

   The document defines a registry for EAP-GTC error code, which may be
   assigned by Specification Required as defined in [RFC2434].  A
   summary of the error code types defined so far is given below:

   646  ERROR_RESTRICTED_LOGON_HOURS

   647  ERROR_ACCT_DISABLED

   648  ERROR_PASSWD_EXPIRED

   649  ERROR_NO_DIALIN_PERMISSION

   691  ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE

   709  ERROR_CHANGING_PASSWORD

   755  ERROR_PAC_I-ID-NO_MATCH
