Abstract

   Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are facing problems where localized
   congestion prevents full utilization of the path between sender and
   receiver at today's "broadband" speeds.  ISPs desire to control this
   congestion, which often appears to be caused by a small number of
   users consuming a large amount of bandwidth.  Building out more
   capacity along all of the path to handle this congestion can be
   expensive and may not result in improvements for all users so network
   operators have sought other ways to manage congestion.  The current
   mechanisms all suffer from difficulty measuring the congestion (as
   distinguished from the total traffic).

   The ConEx Working Group is designing a mechanism to make congestion
   along any path visible at the Internet Layer.  This document
   describes example cases where this mechanism would be useful.

Internet-Draft               ConEx Mechanism                   July 2010


1.  Introduction

   The growth of "always on" broadband connections, coupled with the
   steady increase in access speeds [OfCom], have caused unforeseen
   problems for network operators and users alike.  Users are
   increasingly seeing congestion at peak times and changes in usage
   patterns (with the growth of real-time streaming) simply serve to
   exacerbate this.  Operators want all their users to see a good
   service but are unable to see where congestion problems originate.
   But congestion results from sharing network capacity with others, not
   merely from using it.  In general, today's "DSL" and cable-internet
   users cannot "cause" congestion in the absence of competing traffic.
   (Wireless ISPs and cellular internet have different tradeoffs which
   we will not discuss here.)

   Congestion generally results from the interaction of traffic from an
   ISPs own subscribers with traffic from other users.  The tools
   currently available don't allow an operator to identify which traffic
   contributes most to the congestion and so they are powerless to
   properly control it.

   While building out more capacity to handle increased traffic is
   always good, the expense and lead-time can be prohibitive, especially
   for network operators that charge flat-rate feeds to subscribers and
   are thus unable to charge heavier users more for causing more
   congestion [BB-incentive].  For an operator facing congestion caused
   by other operators' networks, building out its own capacity is
   unlikely to solve the congestion problem.  Operators are thus facing
   increased pressure to find effective solutions to dealing with the
   increasing bandwidth demands of all users.

   The growth of "scavenger" behaviour (e.g.  [LEDBAT]) helps to reduce
   congestion, but can actually make the ISPs problem less tractable.
   These users are trying to make good use of the capacity of the path
   while minimising their own costs.  Thus, users of such services may
   show very heavy total traffic up until the moment congestion is
   detected (at the Transport Layer), but then will immediately back
   off.  ISP monitoring (at the Internet Layer) cannot detect this
   congestion avoidance if the congestion in question is in a different
   domain further along the path; and must treat such users as
   congestion-causing users.

   The ConEx working group proposes that Internet Protocol (IP) packets
   have two "congestion" fields.  The exact protocol details of these
   fields are for another document, but we expect them to provide
   measures of "congestion so far" and "congestion still expected".

      Re-worded bullet on distinguishing ConEx and non-ConEx traffic in
      Section 8.

2.  Definitions

   ConEx expects to build on Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
   [RFC3168] where it is available.  Hence we use the term "congestion"
   in a manner consistent with ECN, namely that congestion occurs before
   any packet is dropped.  In this section we define a number of terms
   that are used throughout the document.

   Congestion:  Congestion is a measure of the probability that a given
      packet will be ECN-marked or dropped as it traverses the network.
      At any given router it is a function of the queue state at that
      router.  Congestion is added in a combinatorial manner, that is,
      routers ignore the congestion a packet has already seen when they
      decide whether to mark it or not.

   Congestion Volume:  Congestion volume is defined as the congestion a
      packet experiences, multiplied by the size of that packet.  It can
      be expressed as the volume of bytes that have been ECN-marked or
      dropped.  By extension, the Congestion Rate would be the
      transmission rate multiplied by the congestion level.

   Upstream Congestion:  The congestion that has already been
      experienced by a packet as it travels along its path.  In other
      words at any point on the path, it is the congestion between the
      source of the packet and that point.

   Downstream Congestion:  The congestion that a packet still has to
      experience on the remainder of its path.  In other words at any
      point it is the congestion still to be experienced as the packet
      travels between that point and its destination.

   Whole Path Congestion:  The total congestion that a packet
      experiences between the ingress to the network and the egress.

   Network Ingress:  The Network Ingress is the first node a packet
      traverses that is outside the source's own network.  In a domestic
      network that will be the first node downstream from the home
      access equipment.  In a business network it may be the first
      router downstream of the firewall.

   Network Egress:  The Network Egress is the last node a packet
      traverses before it enters the destination network.

Internet-Draft               ConEx Mechanism                   July 2010


   ConEx-Enabled:  Any piece of equipment (end-system, router, tunnel
      end-point, firewall, policer, etc) that fully implements the ConEx
      protocol.

   ECN-enabled:  Any router that fully enables Explicit Congestion
      Notification (ECN) as defined in [RFC3168] and any relevant
      updates to that standard.

3.  Existing Approaches to Congestion Management

   A number of ISPs already use some form of traffic management.
   Generally this is an attempt to control the peak-time congestion
   within their network and to better apportion shared network resources
   between customers.  Even ISPs that don't impose such traffic
   management (such as those in Germany) may have caps on the capacity
   they allow for Best Effort traffic in their backhaul.

   These attempts to control congestion have usually focused on the peak
   hours and aim to rate limit heavy users during that time.  For
   example, users who have consumed a certain amount of bandwidth during
   the last 24 hours may be elected to have their traffic shaped once
   the total traffic reaches a given level in certain nodes within the
   operator's network.

   The authors have chosen not to exhaustively list current approaches
   to congestion management.  Broadly these approaches can be divided
   into those that happen at Layer 3 of the OSI model and those that use
   information gathered from higher layers.  In general these approaches
   attempt to find a "proxy" measure for congestion.  Layer 3 approaches
   include:

   o  Volume accounting -- the overall volume of traffic a given user or
      network sends is measured.  Users may be subject to an absolute
      volume cap (e.g. 10Gbytes per month) or the "heaviest" users may
      be sanctioned in some manner.

   o  Rate measurement -- the traffic rate per user or per network can
      be measured.  The absolute rate a given user sends at may be
      limited at peak hours or the average rate may be used as the basis
      for inter-network billing.

   Higher layer approaches include:

   o  Bottleneck rate policing -- bottleneck flow rate policers aim to
      share the available capacity at a given bottleneck between all
      concurrent users.





Briscoe, et al.         Expires January 13, 2011                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               ConEx Mechanism                   July 2010


   o  DPI and application rate policing -- deep packet inspection and
      other techniques can be used to determine what application a given
      traffic flow is associated with.  ISPs may then use this
      information to rate-limit or otherwise sanction certain
      applications at peak hours.

   All of these current approaches suffer from some general limitations.
   First, they introduce performance uncertainty.  Flat-rate pricing
   plans are popular because users appreciate the certainty of having
   their monthly bill amount remain the same for each billing period,
   allowing them to plan their costs accordingly.  But while flat-rate
   pricing avoids billing uncertainty, it creates performance
   uncertainty: users cannot know whether the performance of their
   connection is being altered or degraded based on how the network
   operator manages congestion.

   Second, none of the approaches is able to make use of what may be the
   most important factor in managing congestion: the amount that a given
   endpoint contributes to congestion on the network.  This information
   simply is not available to network nodes, and neither volume nor rate
   nor application usage is an adequate proxy for congestion volume,
   because none of these metrics measures a user or network's actual
   contribution to congestion on the network.

   Finally, none of these solutions accounts for inter-network
   congestion.  Mechanisms may exist that allow an operator to identify
   and mitigate congestion in their own network, but the design of the
   Internet means that only the end-hosts have full visibility of
   congestion information along the whole path.  ConEx allows this
   information to be visible to everyone on the path and thus allows
   operators to make better-informed decisions about controlling
   traffic.

4.  Exposing Congestion

   We argue that current traffic-control mechanisms seek to control the
   wrong quantity.  What matters in the network is neither the volume of
   traffic nor the rate of traffic: it is the contribution to congestion
   over time -- congestion means that your traffic impacts other users,
   and conversely that their traffic impacts you.  So if there is no
   congestion there need not be any restriction on the amount a user can
   send; restrictions only need to apply when others are sending traffic
   such that there is congestion.

   For example, an application intending to transfer large amounts of
   data could use a congestion control mechanism like [LEDBAT] to reduce
   its transmission rate before any competing TCP flows do, by detecting
   an increase in end-to-end delay (as a measure of impending

Internet-Draft               ConEx Mechanism                   July 2010


   congestion).  However such techniques rely on voluntary, altruistic
   action by end users and their application providers.  ISPs can
   neither enforce their use nor avoid penalizing them for congestion
   they avoid.

   The Internet was designed so that end-hosts detect and control
   congestion.  We argue that congestion needs to be visible to network
   nodes as well, not just to the end hosts.  More specifically, a
   network needs to be able to measure how much congestion any
   particular traffic expects to cause between the monitoring point in
   the network and the destination ("rest-of-path congestion").  This
   would be a new capability.  Today a network can use Explicit
   Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC3168] to detect how much congestion
   the traffic has suffered between the source and a monitoring point,
   but not beyond.  This new capability would enable an ISP to give
   incentives for the use of LEDBAT-like applications that seek to
   minimise congestion in the network whilst restricting inappropriate
   uses of traditional TCP and UDP applications.

   So we propose a new approach which we call Congestion Exposure.  We
   propose that congestion information should be made visible at the IP
   layer, so that any network node can measure the contribution to
   congestion of an aggregate of traffic as easily as straight volume
   can be measured today.  Once the information is exposed in this way,
   it is then possible to use it to measure the true impact of any
   traffic on the network.

   In general, congestion exposure gives ISPs a principled way to hold
   their customers accountable for the impact on others of their network
   usage and reward them for choosing congestion-sensitive applications.

4.1.  ECN - a Step in the Right Direction

   Explicit Congestion Notification [RFC3168] allows routers to
   explicitly tell end-hosts that they are approaching the point of
   congestion.  ECN builds on Active Queue Mechanisms such as random
   early discard (RED) [RFC2309] by allowing the router to mark a packet
   with a Congestion Experienced (CE) codepoint, rather than dropping
   it.  The probability of a packet being marked increases with the
   length of the queue and thus the rate of CE marks is a guide to the
   level of congestion at that queue.  This CE codepoint travels forward
   through the network to the receiver which then informs the sender
   that it has seen congestion.  The sender is then required to respond
   as if it had experienced a packet loss.  Because the CE codepoint is
   visible in the IP layer, this approach reveals the upstream
   congestion level for a packet.

   Alas, this is not enough - ECN gives downstream nodes an idea of the

Internet-Draft               ConEx Mechanism                   July 2010


   congestion so far for any flow.  This can help hold a receiver
   accountable for the congestion caused by incoming traffic.  But a
   receiver can only indirectly influence incoming congestion, by
   politely asking the sender to control it.  A receiver cannot make a
   sender install an adaptive codec, or install LEDBAT instead of TCP
   congestion-control.  And a receiver cannot cause an attacker to stop
   flooding it with traffic.

   What is needed is knowledge of the downstream congestion level, for
   which you need additional information that is still concealed from
   the network.

5.  Requirements for ConEx

   This document is intended to highlight some of the possible uses for
   a congestion exposure mechanism such as the one being proposed by the
   ConEx working group.  The actual ConEx mechanism will be defined in
   another document.

   In this section we set out some basic requirements for any ConEx
   mechanism.  We are not saying this is an exhaustive list of those
   requirements.  This list is simply to allow readers to make a
   realistic assessment of the feasibility and utility of the use cases
   set out in Section 8.

   The three key requirements are

   1.  Timeliness of information.  The limitations of current network
       design gives a minimum delay of 1 round trip time (RTT) for
       congestion information to circulate the network.  It is important
       that the conex mechanism operates on similar timescales to ensure
       the congestion information it exposes is as up to date as
       possible.  Stale congestion information is useless since
       congestion levels can fluctuate widely over relatively short
       timescales.

   2.  Accuracy of information.  In order to be useful, congestion
       information has to be sufficiently accurate for the purposes for
       which it is to be used.  In general the main purposes are
       monitoring congestion and controlling congestion.  As a minimum,
       conex should equal the accuracy required for current TCP
       implementations.  A unary signal such as that provided by ECN is
       sufficient though a more precise signal may be desirable.

   3.  Visibility of information.  In order to be useful conex
       information should be visible at every point in the network.  In
       today's networks that means it must be visible at the IP layer.

5.1.  ConEx Issues

   If ConEx information is to be useful, it has to be accurate (within
   the limitations of the available feedback).  This raises three issues
   that need to be addressed:

   Distinguishing ConEx traffic from non-ConEx traffic:  An ISP may
      reasonably choose to do nothing different with ConEx traffic.
      Alternatively they might want to incentivise it in order to give
      it marginally better service.

   Over-declaring congestion:  ConEx relies on the sender accurately
      declaring the congestion they expect to see.  During TCP slow-
      start a sender is unable to predict the level of congestion they
      will experience and it is advisable to declare that expect to see
      some congestion on the first packet.  However it is important to
      be cautious when over-declaring congestion lest you erode trust in
      the system.  We do not initially propose any mechanism to deal
      with this issue.

   Under-declaring congestion:  ConEx requires the sender to set the
      downstream congestion field in each packet to their best estimate
      of what they expect the whole path congestion to be.  If this
      expected congestion level is to be used for traffic management
      (see use cases) then it benefits the user to under-declare.
      Mechanisms are needed to prevent this happening.

      There are three approaches that may work (individually or in
      combination):

      *  An ingress router can monitor a user's feedback to see what
         their reported congestion level actually is.

      *  If the congestion field carries the actual congestion value
         then a ConEx-Enabled Policer could potentially drop any packet
         with a downstream-congestion value of zero or less.

      *  An egress router can actively monitor some or all flows to
         check that they are complying with the requirement that the
         downstream congestion value should be zero or (slightly
         positive) when it reaches the egress.

6.  A Possible Congestion Exposure Mechanism

   One possible protocol is based on a concept known as re-feedback
   [Re-Feedback], and builds on existing active queue management
   techniques like RED [RFC2309] and ECN [RFC3168] that network elements
   can already use to measure and expose congestion.  The protocol is

Internet-Draft               ConEx Mechanism                   July 2010


   described in more detail in [Fairer-faster], but we summarise it
   below.

   In this protocol packets have two Congestion fields in their IP
   header:

   o  An Upstream Congestion field to record the congestion already
      experienced along the path.  Routers indicate their current
      congestion level by updating this field in every packet.  As the
      packet traverses the network it builds up a record of the overall
      congestion along its path in this field.  This data is sent back
      to the sender who uses it to determine its transmission rate.
      This can be achieved by using the existing ECN field [RFC3168].

   o  A whole-path congestion field that uses re-feedback to record the
      total congestion expected along the path.  The sender does this by
      re-inserting the current Congestion level for the path into this
      field for every packet it transmits.

   Thus at any node downstream of the sender you can see the Upstream
   Congestion for the packet and the whole path congestion (with a time
   lag of one round-trip-time (RTT)) and can calculate the Downstream
   Congestion by subtracting the Upstream from the Whole Path
   Congestion.

   So congestion exposure can be achieved by coupling congestion
   notification from routers with the re-insertion of this information
   by the sender.  This establishes information symmetry between users
   and network providers.

7.  ConEx Architectural Elements

   ConEx is a simple concept that has revolutionary implications.  It is
   that rare thing -- a truly disruptive technology, and as such it is
   hard to imagine the variety of uses it may be put to.  Before even
   thinking what it might be used for we need to address the issue of
   how it can be used.  This section describes four architectural
   elements that can be placed in the network and which utilise ConEx
   information to monitor or control traffic flows.

   In the following we are assuming the most abstract version of the
   ConEx mechanism, namely that every packet carries two congestion
   fields, one for upstream congestion and one for downstream.
   Section 6 outlines one possible approach for this.

7.1.  ConEx Monitoring

   One of the most useful things ConEx provides is the ability to
   monitor (and control) the amount of congestion entering or leaving a
   network.  With ConEx, each packet carries sufficient information to
   work out the Upstream, Downstream and Total Congestion Volume that
   packet is responsible for.  This allows the overall Congestion Volume
   to be calculated at any point in the network.  In effect this gives a
   measure of how much excess traffic has been sent that was above the
   instantaneous transmission capacity of the network.  A 1 Gbps router
   that is 0.1% congested implies that there is 1 Mbps of excess traffic
   at that point in time.

   The figure below shows 2 conceptual pieces of network equipment that
   utilise ConEx information in order to monitor the flow of congestion
   through the network.  The Border Monitor sits at the border between
   two networks, while the Edge Monitor sits at the ingress or egress to
   the Internetwork.

                 Table 1: Requirements for Edge Monitoring

   Edge Monitors are ideally positioned to verify the accuracy of ConEx
   markings.  If there is an imbalance between the expected congestion
   and the actual congestion then this will show up at the egress.  Edge
   Monitors can also be used by an operator to measure the service a
   given customer is receiving by monitoring how much congestion their
   traffic is causing.  This may allow them to take pre-emptive action
   if they detect any anomalies.

   +------------+-----------------+-----------------+------------------+

                Table 2: Requirements for Border Monitoring

   At any border between 2 networks, the operator can see the total
   Congestion Volume that is being forwarded into its network by the
   neighbouring network.  A Border Monitor is able to measure the bulk
   congestion markings and establish the flow of Congestion Volume each
   way across the border.  This could be used as the basis for inter-
   network settlements.  It also provides information to target upgrades
   to where they are actually needed and might help to identify network
   problems.  Border Monitoring really needs the majority of the network
   to be ECN-Enabled in order to provide the necessary Upstream
   Congestion signal.  Clearly the greatest benefit comes when there is
   also ConEx deployment in the nnetwork.  However, as long as the
   sender is sending accurate ConEx information and the majority of the
   network is ECN-enabled, border monitoring will work.

7.2.  ConEx Policing

   As shown above, ConEx gives an easy method of measuring Congestion
   Volume.  This information can be used as a control metric for making
   traffic management decisions (such as deciding which traffic to
   prioritise) or to identify and block sources of persistent and
   damaging congestion.  Simple policer mechanisms, such as those

   described in [Policing-freedom] and [re-ecn-motive], can control the
   overall congestion volume traversing a network.  Ingress Policing
   typically happens at the Ingress Node, Egress Policing typically
   happens at the Egress Node and Border Policing can happen at any
   border between two networks.  The current charter concentrates on use
   cases employing Egress Policers.

   user's traffic has caused throughout the network, and then use this
   to prioritise the traffic accordingly.  By itself, such a policer
   cannot tell how much of this congestion was caused in the ISP's own
   network, but it will identify which users are the "heaviest" in terms
   of the congestion they have caused.  Assuming the ConEx information
   is accurate then the Egress Policer will be able to see how much
   congestion exists between it and the final destination (what you
   might call "last-mile" congestion).  There are a number of strategies
   that could be used to determine how traffic is treated by an Egress
   Policer.  Obviously traffic that is not ConEx enabled needs to
   receive some form of "default" treatment.  Traffic that is ConEx
   enabled may have under-declared congestion in which case it would be
   reasonable to give it a low scheduling priority.  Traffic that
   appears to be over-declaring congestion may be simply a result of
   especially high "last-mile" congestion, in which case the ISP may
   want to upgrade the access capacity, or may want to try and reduce
   the volume of traffic.  Where the ISP knows what the "last-mile"
   congestion is (for instance if it is able to measure several users
   sharing that same capacity) then any remaining over-declared
   congestion might be seen as a signal that the sender wishes to
   prioritise this traffic.

   At the Network Ingress, an ISP can police the amount of congestion a
   user is causing by limiting the congestion volume they send into the
   network.  One system that achieves this is described in
   [Policing-freedom].  This uses a modified token bucket to limit the
   congestion rate being sent rather than the overall rate.  Such
   ingress policing is relatively simple as it requires no flow state.
   Furthermore, unlike many mechanisms, it treats all a user's packets
   equally.

                   Table 5: Border Policer Requirements

   A Border Policer will allow an operator to directly control the
   congestion that it allows into its network.  Normally we would expect
   the controls to be related to some form of contractual obligation
   between the two parties.  However, such Policing could also be used
   to mitigate some effects of Distributed Denial of Service (see
   Section 8.3).  In effect a Border Policer encourages the network
   upstream to take responsibility for congestion it will cause

   downstream and could be seen as an incentive for that network to
   participate in ConEx (e.g. install Ingress Policers)

8.  ConEx Use Cases

   This section sets out some of the use cases for ConEx.  These use
   cases rely on some of the conceptual network elements (policers and
   monitors) described in Section 7 above.  The authors don't claim this
   is an exhaustive list of use cases, nor that these have equal merit.
   In most cases ConEx is not the only solution to achieve these.  But
   these use cases represent a consensus among people that have been
   working on this approach for some years.

8.1.  ConEx as a basis for traffic management

   Currently many ISPs impose some form of traffic management at peak
   hours.  This is a simple economic necessity -- the only reason the
   Internet works as a commercial concern is that ISPs are able to rely
   on statistical multiplexing to share their expensive core network
   between large numbers of customers.  In order to ensure all customers
   get some chance to access the network, the "heaviest" customers will
   be subjected to some form of traffic management at peak times
   (typically a rate cap for certain types of traffic) [Fair-use].
   Often this traffic management is done with expensive flow aware
   devices such as DPI boxes or flow-aware routers.

   ConEx offers a better approach that will actually target the users
   that are causing the congestion.  By using Ingress or Egress
   Policers, an ISP can identify which users are causing the greatest
   Congestion Volume throughout the network.  This can then be used as
   the basis for traffic management decisions.  The Ingress Policer
   described in [Policing-freedom] is one interesting approach that
   gives the user a congestion volume limit.  So long as they stay
   within their limit then their traffic is unaffected.  Once they
   exceed that limit then their traffic will be blocked temporarily.

8.2.  ConEx to incentivise scavenger transports

   Recent work proposes a new approach for QoS where traffic is provided
   with a less than best effort or "scavenger" quality of service.  The
   idea is that low priority but high volume traffic such as OS updates,
   P2P file transfers and view-later TV programs should be allowed to
   use any spare network capacity, but should rapidly get out of the way
   if a higher priority or interactive application starts up.  One
   solution being actively explored is LEDBAT which proposes a new
   congestion control algorithm that is less aggressive in seeking out
   bandwidth than TCP.




Briscoe, et al.         Expires January 13, 2011               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft               ConEx Mechanism                   July 2010


   At present most ISPs assume a strong correlation between the volume
   of a flow and the impact that flow causes in the network.  This
   assumption has been eroded by the growth of interactive streaming
   which behaves in an inelastic manner and hence can cause high
   congestion at relatively low data volumes.  Currently LEDBAT-like
   transports get no incentive from the ISP since they still transfer
   large volumes of data and may reach high transfer speeds if the
   network is uncongested.  Consequently the only current incentive for
   LEDBAT is that it can reduce self-congestion effects.

   If the ISP has deployed a ConEx-aware ingress policer then they are
   able to incentivise the use of LEDBAT because a user will be policed
   according to the overall congestion volume their traffic generates,
   not the rate or data volume.  If all background file transfers are
   only generating a low level of congestion, then the sender has more
   "congestion budget" to "spend" on their interactive applications.  It
   can be shown [Kelly] that this approach improves social welfare -- in
   other words if you limit the congestion that all users can generate
   then everyone benefits from a better service.

8.3.  ConEx to mitigate DDoS

   DDoS relies on subverting innocent end users and getting them to send
   flood traffic to a given destination.  This is intended to cause a
   rapid increase in congestion in the immediate vicinity of that
   destination.  If it fails to do this then it can't be called Denial
   of Service.  If the ingress ISP has deployed Ingress Policers, that
   ISP will effectively limit how much DDoS traffic enters the 'net.  If
   any ISP along the path has deployed Border Monitors then they will be
   able to detect a sharp rise in Congestion Volume and if they have
   Border Policers they will be able to "turn off" this traffic.  If the
   victim of the DDoS attack is behind an Egress Monitor then their ISP
   will be able to detect which traffic is causing problems.  If the
   compromised user tries to use the 'net during the DDoS attack, they
   will quickly become aware that something is wrong, and their ISP can
   show the evidence that their computer has become zombified.

   DDoS is a genuine problem and so far there is no perfect solution.
   ConEx does serve to raise the bar somewhat and can avoid the need for
   some of the more draconian measures that are currently used to
   control DDoS.  More details of this can be found in [Malice].

8.4.  Accounting for Congestion Volume

   Accountability was one of the original design goals for the Internet
   [Design-Philosophy].  At the time it was ranked low because the
   network was non-commercial and it was assumed users had the best
   interests of the network at heart.  Nowadays users generally treat



Briscoe, et al.         Expires January 13, 2011               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft               ConEx Mechanism                   July 2010


   the network as a commodity and the Internet has become highly
   commercialised.  This causes problems for ISPs and others which they
   have tried to solve and often leads to a tragedy of the commons where
   users end up fighting each other for scarce peak capacity.

   The most elegant solution would be to introduce an Internet-wide
   system of accountability where every actor in the network is held to
   account for the impact they have on others.  If Policers are placed
   at every Network Ingress or Egress and Border Monitors at every
   border, then you have the basis for a system of congestion
   accounting.  Simply by controlling the overall Congestion Volume each
   end-system or stub-network can send you ensure everyone gets a better
   service.

8.5.  ConEx as a form of differential QoS

   Most QoS approaches require the active participation of routers to
   control the delay and loss characteristics for the traffic.  For
   real-time interactive traffic it is clear that low delay (and
   predictable jitter) are critical, and thus these probably always need
   different treatment at a router.  However if low loss is the issue
   then ConEx offers an alternative approach.

   Assuming the ingress ISP has deployed a ConEx Ingress Policer, then
   the only control on a user's traffic is dependent on the congestion
   that user has caused.  Likewise, if they are receiving traffic
   through a ConEx Egress Policer then their ISP will impose traffic
   controls (prioritisation, rate limiting, etc) based on the congestion
   they have caused.  If an end-user (be they the receiver or sender)
   wants to prioritise some traffic over other traffic then they can
   allow that traffic to generate or cause more congestion.  The price
   they will pay will be to reduce the congestion that their other
   traffic causes.

   Streaming video content-delivery is a good candidate for such ConEx-
   mediated QoS.  Such traffic can tolerate moderately high delays, but
   there are strong economic pressures to maintain a high enough data
   rate (as that will directly influence the Quality of Experience the
   end-user receives.  This approach removes the need for bandwidth
   brokers to establish QoS sessions, by removing the need to coordinate
   requests from multiple sources to pre-allocate bandwidth, as well as
   to coordinate which allocations to revoke when bandwidth predictions
   turn out to be wrong.  There is also no need to "rate-police" at the
   boundaries on a per-flow basis, removing the need to keep per-flow
   state (which in turn makes this approach more scalable).

8.6.  Partial vs. Full Deployment

   In a fully-deployed ConEx-enabled internet, [QoS-Models] shows that
   ISP settlements based on congestion volume can allocate money to
   where upgrades are needed.  Fully-deployed implies that ConEx-marked
   packets which have not exhausted their expected congestion would go
   through a congested path in preference to non-ConEx packets, with
   money changing hands to justify that priority.

   In a partial deployment, routers that ignore ConEx markings and let
   them pass unaltered are no problem unless they become congested and
   drop packets.  Since ConEx incentivises the use of lower congestion
   transports, such congestion drops should anyway become rare events.
   ConEx-unaware routers that do drop ConEx-marked packets would cause a
   problem so to minimise this risk ConEx should be designed such that
   ConEx packets will appear valid to any node they traverse.  Failing
   that it could be possible to bypass such nodes with a tunnel.

   If any network is not ConEx enabled then the sender and receiver have
   to rely on ECN-marking or packet drops to establish the congestion
   level.  If the receiver isn't ConEx-enabled then there needs to be
   some form of compatibility mode.  Even in such partial deployments
   the end-users and access networks will benefit from ConEx.  This will
   put create incentives for ConEx to be more widely adopted as access
   networks put pressure on their backhaul providers to use congestion
   as the basis of their interconnect agreement.

   The actual charge per unit of congestion would be specified in an
   interconnection agreement, with economic pressure driving that charge
   downward to the cost to upgrade whenever alternative paths are
   available.  That charge would most likely be invisible to the
   majority of users.  Instead such users will have a contractual
   allowance to cause congestion, and would see packets dropped when
   that allowance is depleted.

   Once an Autonomous System (AS) agrees to pay any congestion charges
   to any other AS it forwards to, it has an economic incentive to
   increase congestion-so-far marking for any congestion within its
   network.  Failure to do this quickly becomes a significant cost,
   giving it an incentive to turn on such marking.

   End users (or the writers of the applications they use) will be given
   an incentive to use a congestion control that back off more
   aggressively than TCP for any elastic traffic.  Indeed they will
   actually have an incentive to use fully weighted congestion controls
   that allow traffic to cause congestion in proportion to its priority.
   Traffic which backs off more aggressively than TCP will see
   congestion charges remain the same (or even drop) as congestion

   increases; traffic which backs off less aggressively will see charges
   rise, but the user may be prepared to accept this if it is high-
   priority traffic; traffic which backs off not at all will see charges
   rise dramatically.

9.  Other issues

9.1.  Congestion as a Commercial Secret

   Network operators have long viewed the congestion levels in their
   network as a business secret.  In some ways this harks back to the
   days of fixed-line telecommunications where congestion manifested as
   failed connections or dropped calls.  But even in modern data-centric
   packet networks congestion is viewed as a secret not to be shared
   with competitors.  It can be debated whether this view is sensible,
   but it may make operators uneasy about deploying ConEx.  The
   following two examples highlight some of the arguments used:

   o  An ISP buys backhaul capacity from an operator.  Most ISPs want
      their customers to get a decent service and so they want the
      backhaul to be relatively uncongested.  If there is competition,
      operators will seek to reassure their customers (the ISPs) that
      their network is not congested in order to attract their custom.
      Some operators may see ConEx as a threat since it will enable
      those ISPs to see the actual congestion in their network.  On the
      other hand, operators with low congestion could use ConEx to show
      how well their network performs, and so might have an incentive to
      enable it.

   o  ISPs would like to be part of the lucrative content provision
      market.  Currently the ISP can gain a competitive edge as it can
      put its own content in a higher QoS class, whereas traffic from
      content providers has to use the Best Effort class.  The ISP may
      take the view that if they can conceal the congestion level in
      their Best Effort class this will make it harder for the content
      provider to maintain a good level of QoS.  But in reality the
      Content Provider will just use the feedback mechanisms in
      streaming protocols such as Adobe Flash to monitor the congestion.

   Of course some might say that the idea of keeping congestion secret
   is silly.  After all, end-hosts already have knowledge of the
   congestion throughout the network, albeit only along specific paths,
   and ISPs can work out that there is persistent congestion as their
   customers will be suffering degraded network performance.

10.  Security Considerations

   This document proposes a mechanism tagging onto Explicit Congestion
   Notification [RFC3168], and inherits the security issues listed
   therein.  The additional issues from ConEx markings relate to the
   degree of trust each forwarding point places in the ConEx markings it
   receives, which is a business decision mostly orthogonal to the
   markings themselves.

   One expected use of exposed congestion information is to hold the
   end-to-end transport and the network accountable to each other.  The
   network cannot be relied on to report information to the receiver
   against its interest, and the same applies for the information the
   receiver feeds back to the sender, and that the sender reports back
   to the network.  Looking at each in turn:

   The Network  In general it is not in any network's interest to under-
      declare congestion since this will have potentially negative
      consequences for all users of that network.  It may be in its
      interest to over-declare congestion if, for instance, it wishes to
      force traffic to move away to a different network or simply to
      reduce the amount of traffic it is carrying.  Congestion Exposure
      itself won't significantly alter the incentives for and against
      honest declaration of congestion by a network, but we can imagine
      applications of Congestion Exposure that will change these
      incentives.  There is a perception among network operators that
      their level of congestion is a business secret.  Today, congestion
      is one of the worst-kept secrets a network has, because end-hosts
      can see congestion better than network operators can.  Congestion
      Exposure will enable network operators to pinpoint whether
      congestion is on one side or the other of any border.  It is
      conceivable that forwarders with underprovisioned networks may try
      to obstruct deployment of Congestion Exposure.

   The Receiver  Receivers generally have an incentive to under-declare
      congestion since they generally wish to receive the data from the
      sender as rapidly as possible.  [Savage] explains how a receiver
      can significantly improve their throughput my failing to declare
      congestion.  This is a problem with or without Congestion
      Exposure.  [KGao] explains one possible technique to encourage
      receiver's to be honest in their declaration of congestion.

   The Sender  One proposed mechanism for Congestion Exposure deployment
      adds a requirement for a sender to advise the network how much
      congestion it has suffered or caused.  Although most senders
      currently respond to congestion they are informed of, one use of
      exposed congestion information might be to encourage sources of
      persistent congestion to back off more aggressively.  Then clearly
      there may be an incentive for the sender to under-declare
      congestion.  This will be a particular problem with sources of
      flooding attacks.  "Policing" mechanisms have been proposed to
      deal with this.

   In addition there are potential problems from source spoofing.  A
   malicious sender can pretend to be another user by spoofing the
   source address.  Congestion Exposure allows for "Policers" and
   "Traffic Shapers" so as to be robust against injection of false
   congestion information into the forward path.
