Internet-Draft      TLS Transport Mapping for Syslog           June 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis]) to provide a secure connection for the
   transport of syslog [I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol] messages.  This
   document describes the security threats to syslog and how TLS can be
   used to counter such threats.

1.1.  Terminology

   The following definitions are used in this document:

   o  An "originator" generates syslog content to be carried in a
      message.

   o  A "collector" gathers syslog content for further analysis.

   o  A "relay" forwards messages, accepting messages from originators
      or other relays, and sending them to collectors or other relays.

   o  A "transport sender" passes syslog messages to a specific
      transport protocol.

   o  A "transport receiver" takes syslog messages from a specific
      transport protocol.

   o  A "TLS client" is an application that can initiate a TLS
      connection by sending a Client Hello to a peer.

   o  A "TLS server" is an application that can receive a Client Hello
      from a peer and reply with a Server Hello.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Security Requirements for Syslog

   Syslog messages may transit several hops to arrive at the intended
   collector.  Some intermediary networks may not be trusted by the
   originator, relay, or receiver because the network is in a different
   security domain or at a different security level from the originator,
   relay, or collector.  Another security concern is that the
   originator, relay, or receiver itself is in an insecure network.

   There are several threats to be addressed for syslog security.  The
   primary threats are:

Internet-Draft      TLS Transport Mapping for Syslog           June 2008


   o  Masquerade.  An unauthorized transport sender may send messages to
      a legitimate transport receiver, or an unauthorized transport
      receiver tries to deceive a legitimate transport sender into
      sending syslog messages to it.

   o  Modification.  An attacker between the transport sender and the
      transport receiver may modify an in-transit syslog message and
      then forward the message to the transport receiver.  Such
      modification may make the transport receiver misunderstand the
      message or cause it to behave in undesirable ways.

   o  Disclosure.  An unauthorized entity may examine the contents of
      the syslog messages, gaining unauthorized access to the
      information.  Some data in syslog messages is sensitive and may be
      useful to an attacker, such as the password of an authorized
      administrator or user.

   The secondary threat is:

   o  Message stream modification.  An attacker may delete one or more
      syslog message from a series of messages, replay a message, or
      alter the delivery sequence.  The syslog protocol itself is not
      based on message order, but an event in a syslog message may
      relate semantically to events in other messages, so message
      ordering may be important to understanding a sequence of events.

   The following threats are deemed to be of lesser importance for
   syslog, and are not addressed in this document:

   o  Denial of Service

   o  Traffic Analysis


3.  Using TLS to Secure Syslog

   TLS can be used as a secure transport to counter all the primary
   threats to syslog described above:

   o  Confidentiality to counter disclosure of the message contents;

   o  Integrity checking to counter modifications to a message on a hop-
      by-hop basis;

   o  Server or mutual authentication to counter masquerade.

   Note: This secure transport (i.e., TLS) only secures syslog transport
   in a hop-by-hop manner, and is not concerned with the contents of

Internet-Draft      TLS Transport Mapping for Syslog           June 2008


   syslog messages.  In particular, the authenticated identity of the
   transport sender (e.g., subject name in the certificate) is not
   necessarily related to the HOSTNAME field of the syslog message.
   When authentication of syslog message origin is required,
   [I-D.ietf-syslog-sign] can be used.


4.  Protocol Elements

4.1.  Port Assignment

   A syslog transport sender is always a TLS client and a transport
   receiver is always a TLS server.

   The TCP port NNN has been allocated as the default port for syslog
   over TLS, as defined in this document.

   Note to RFC Editor: please replace NNN with the IANA-assigned value,
   and remove this note.

4.2.  Initiation

   The transport sender should initiate a connection to the transport
   receiver and then send the TLS Client Hello to begin the TLS
   handshake.  When the TLS handshake has finished the transport sender
   MAY then send the first syslog message.

   TLS typically uses certificates [RFC5280] to authenticate peers.
   Implementations MUST support TLS 1.2 [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis] and
   are REQUIRED to support the mandatory to implement cipher suite,
   which is TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA.  This document is assumed to
   apply to future versions of TLS, in which case the mandatory to
   implement cipher suite for the implemented version MUST be supported.

4.2.1.  Certificate-Based Authentication

   Both syslog transport sender (TLS Client) and syslog transport
   receiver (TLS server) MUST implement certificate-based
   authentication.  This consists of validating the certificate and
   verifying that the peer has the corresponding private key.  The
   latter part is performed by TLS.  To ensure interoperability between
   clients and servers, the following methods for certificate validation
   SHALL be implemented:

   o  Certification path validation: The TLS peer is configured with one
      or more trust anchors (typically root CA certificates), which
      allow it to verify a binding between the subject name and the
      public key.  Additional policy controls needed for authorizing the

Internet-Draft      TLS Transport Mapping for Syslog           June 2008


      syslog transport sender and receiver (i.e., verifying that the
      subject name represents an authorized party) are described in
      Section 5.  Certificate path validation is performed as defined in
      [RFC5280].  This method is useful where there is a PKI deployment.

   o  End-entity certificate matching: The transport sender or receiver
      is configured with information necessary to identify the valid
      end-entity certificates of its authorized peers.  The end-entity
      certificates can be self-signed, and no certification path
      validation is needed.  Implementations MUST support certificate
      fingerprints in Section 4.2.2 and MAY allow other formats for end-
      entity certificates such as a DER encoded certificate.  This
      method provides an alternative to a PKI that is simple to deploy
      and still maintains a reasonable level of security.

   Both transport receiver and transport sender implementations MUST
   provide a means to generate a key pair and self-signed certificate in
   the case that a key pair and certificate are not available through
   another mechanism.

   The transport receiver and transport sender SHOULD provide mechanisms
   to record the end-entity certificate for the purpose of correlating
   it with the sent or received data.

4.2.2.  Certificate Fingerprints

   Both client and server implementations MUST make the certificate
   fingerprints for their certificate available through a management
   interface.

   The mechanism to generate a fingerprint is to take the hash of the
   DER-encoded certificate using a cryptographically strong algorithm
   and convert the result into colon separated, hexadecimal bytes, each
   represented by 2 uppercase ASCII characters.  When a fingerprint
   value is displayed or configured the fingerprint is prepended with an
   ASCII label identifying the hash function followed by a colon.
   Implementations MUST support SHA-1 as the hash algorithm and use the
   ASCII label "SHA1" to identify the SHA-1 algorithm.  The length of a
   SHA-1 hash is 20 bytes and the length of the corresponding
   fingerprint string is 64 characters.  An example certificate
   fingerprint is:

      SHA1:E1:2D:53:2B:7C:6B:8A:29:A2:76:C8:64:36:0B:08:4B:7A:F1:9E:9D

   During validation the hash is extracted from the fingerprint and
   compared against the hash calculated over the received certificate.

Internet-Draft      TLS Transport Mapping for Syslog           June 2008


4.2.3.  Cryptographic Level

   Syslog applications SHOULD be implemented in a manner that permits
   administrators, as a matter of local policy, to select the
   cryptographic level and authentication options they desire.

   TLS permits the resumption of an earlier TLS session or the use of
   another active session when a new session is requested, in order to
   save the expense of another full TLS handshake.  The security
   parameters of the resumed session are reused for the requested
   session.  The security parameters SHOULD be checked against the
   security requirement of the requested session to make sure that the
   resumed session provides proper security.

4.3.  Sending data

   All syslog messages MUST be sent as TLS "application data".  It is
   possible that multiple syslog messages be contained in one TLS
   record, or that a syslog message be transferred in multiple TLS
   records.  The application data is defined with the following ABNF
   [RFC5234] expression:

   APPLICATION-DATA = 1*SYSLOG-FRAME

   SYSLOG-FRAME = MSG-LEN SP SYSLOG-MSG

   MSG-LEN = NONZERO-DIGIT *DIGIT

   SP = %d32

   NONZERO-DIGIT = %d49-57

   DIGIT = %d48 / NONZERO-DIGIT

   SYSLOG-MSG is defined in syslog [I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol] protocol.

4.3.1.  Message Length

   The message length is the octet count of the SYSLOG-MSG in the
   SYSLOG-FRAME.  A transport receiver MUST use the message length to
   delimit a syslog message.  There is no upper limit for a message
   length per se.  However, in order to establish a baseline for
   interoperability, this specification requires that a transport
   receiver MUST be able to process messages with a length up to and
   including 2048 octets.  Transport receiver SHOULD be able to process
   messages with lengths up to and including 8192 octets.

Internet-Draft      TLS Transport Mapping for Syslog           June 2008


4.4.  Closure

   A TLS client MUST close the associated TLS connection if the
   connection is not expected to deliver any syslog messages later.  It
   MUST send a TLS close_notify alert before closing the connection.  A
   client MAY choose to not wait for the server's close_notify alert and
   simply close the connection, thus generating an incomplete close on
   the server side.  Once the server gets a close_notify from the
   client, it MUST reply with a close_notify unless it becomes aware
   that the connection has already been closed by the client (e.g., the
   closure was indicated by TCP).

   When no data is received from a connection for a long time (where the
   application decides what "long" means), a server MAY close the
   connection.  The server MUST attempt to initiate an exchange of
   close_notify alerts with the client before closing the connection.
   Servers that are unprepared to receive any more data MAY close the
   connection after sending the close_notify alert, thus generating an
   incomplete close on the client side.  When the client has received
   the close_notify alert from the server and still has pending data to
   send, it SHOULD send the pending data before sending the close_notify
   alert.


5.  Security Policies

   Different environments have different security requirements and
   therefore would deploy different security policies.  This section
   discusses some of the security policies that may be implemented by
   syslog transport receivers and syslog transport senders.  The
   security policies describe the requirements for authentication and
   authorization.  The list of policies in this section is not
   exhaustive and other policies MAY be implemented.

   If the peer does not meet the requirements of the security policy,
   the TLS handshake SHOULD be aborted with an appropriate TLS alert.

5.1.  End-Entity Certificate Based Authorization

   In the simplest case, the transport sender and receiver are
   configured with information necessary to identity the valid end-
   entity certificates of its authorized peers.

   Implementations MUST support specifying the authorized peers using
   certificate fingerprints, as described in Section 4.2.1 and
   Section 4.2.2.

Internet-Draft      TLS Transport Mapping for Syslog           June 2008


5.2.  Subject Name Authorization

   Implementations MUST support specifying the authorized peers using
   locally configured host names, MUST support certification path
   validation [RFC5280] and matching the name with the certificate as
   follows:

   Implementations MUST support matching the locally configured name
   against a SubjectAltName field with a type of dNSName and SHOULD
   support checking the name against the Common Name portion of the
   Subject Distinguished Name.  If more than one identity is present in
   the certificate, a match in any one of the set is considered
   acceptable.  Matching of host names is case-insensitive.
   Implementations also MAY support wildcards in locally configured
   names to match a range of values.  For example, a "*" wildcard
   character MAY be used as the left-most name component.  In this case,
   *.example.com would match a.example.com, foo.example.com, etc., but
   would not match example.com.  Using a wildcard for the entire host
   name makes it possible to deploy trust-root-based authorization where
   all credentials issued by a particular CA trust root are authorized.

   Implementations MAY also support matching a locally configured
   identifier against other parts of the certificate, such as the
   SerialNumber portion of the Subject Distinguished Name, or a
   SubjectAltName of type ipAddress.  Implementations MAY support other
   checks such as restrictions on the depth of a certificate chain.

5.3.  Unauthenticated Transport Sender

   In some environments, the authenticity of syslog data is not
   important or it is verifiable by other means, so transport receivers
   may accept data from any transport sender.  To achieve this, the
   transport receiver can skip transport sender authentication (by not
   requesting client authentication in TLS, or accepting any
   certificate).  In this case, the transport receiver is authenticated
   and authorized, however this policy does not protect against the
   threat of transport sender masquerade described in Section 2.  The
   use of this policy is generally NOT RECOMMENDED for this reason.

5.4.  Unauthenticated Transport Receiver

   In some environments the confidentiality of syslog data is not
   important so messages are sent to any transport receiver.  To achieve
   this, the transport sender can skip transport receiver authentication
   (by accepting any certificate).  While this policy does authenticate
   and authorize the transport sender, it does not protect against the
   threat of transport receiver masquerade described in Section 2,
   leaving the data sent vulnerable to disclosure and modification.  The

Internet-Draft      TLS Transport Mapping for Syslog           June 2008


   use of this policy is generally NOT RECOMMENDED for this reason.

5.5.  Unauthenticated Transport Receiver and Sender

   In environments where security is not a concern at all, both the
   transport receiver and transport sender can skip authentication (as
   described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3).  This policy does not protect
   against any of the threats described in Section 2 and is therefore
   NOT RECOMMENDED.


6.  Security Considerations

   This section describes security considerations in addition to those
   in [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis].

6.1.  Authentication and Authorization Policies

   Section 5 discusses various security policies that may be deployed.
   The threats in Section 2 are mitigated only if both the transport
   sender and transport receiver are properly authenticated and
   authorized, as described in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2.  These are
   the RECOMMENDED configurations for a default policy.

   If the transport receiver does not authenticate the transport sender
   it may accept data from an attacker.  Unless it has another way of
   authenticating the source of the data, the data should not be
   trusted.  This is especially important if the syslog data is going to
   be used to detect and react to security incidents.  The transport
   receiver may also increase its vulnerability to denial of service,
   resource consumption and other attacks if it does not authenticate
   the transport sender.  Because of the increased vulnerability to
   attack, this type of configuration is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   If the transport sender does not authenticate the syslog transport
   receiver then it may send data to an attacker.  This may disclose
   sensitive data within the log information that is useful to an
   attacker resulting in further compromises within the system.  If a
   transport sender is operated in this mode, the data sent SHOULD be
   limited to data that is not valuable to an attacker.  In practice
   this is very difficult to achieve, so this type of configuration is
   NOT RECOMMENDED.

   Forgoing authentication and authorization on both sides allows for
   man-in-the-middle, masquerade and other types of attacks that can
   completely compromise integrity and confidentiality of the data.
   This type of configuration is NOT RECOMMENDED.

6.2.  Name Validation

   The subject name authorization policy authorizes the subject in the
   certificate against a locally configured name.  It is generally not
   appropriate to obtain this name through some other means such as DNS
   lookup since this introduces additional security vulnerabilities.

6.3.  Reliability

   It should be noted that the syslog transport specified in this
   document does not use application-layer acknowledgments.  TCP uses
   retransmissions to provide protection against some forms of data
   loss.  However, if the TCP connection (or TLS session) is broken for
   some reason (or closed by the transport receiver), the syslog
   transport sender cannot always know what messages were successfully
   delivered to the syslog application at the other end.


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Port Number

   IANA is requested to assign a TCP port number in the range 1..1023 in
   the http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers registry which will
   be the default port for syslog over TLS, as defined in this document.


8.  Acknowledgments

   Authors appreciate Eric Rescorla, Rainer Gerhards, Tom Petch, Anton
   Okmianski, Balazs Scheidler, Bert Wijnen, Martin Scheutte, Chris
   Lonvick and members of the syslog working group for their effort on
   issues resolving discussion.  Authors would also like to appreciate
   Balazs Scheidler, Tom Petch and other persons for their input on
   security threats of syslog.  The authors would like to acknowledge
   David Harrington for his detailed reviews of the content and grammar
   of the document and Pasi Eronen for his contributions to certificate
   authentication and authorization sections.
