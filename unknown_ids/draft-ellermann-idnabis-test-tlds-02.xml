        To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion, a few top level
        domain names are reserved for use in private testing, as examples in
        documentation, and the like.  In addition, a few second level domain
        names reserved for use as examples are documented.  This memo
        replaces RFC 2606.

<section title="Introduction"><t>
    The global Internet Domain Name System is documented in
    <xref target="RFC1034" />,
    <xref target="RFC1035" />,
    <xref target="RFC1591" />,
    <xref target="RFC3696" />,
    and numerous additional Requests for Comments. It defines a tree
    of names starting with root, ".", immediately below which are
    top level domain names such as ".com" and ".us". Below top level
    domain names there are normally additional levels of names.
</t><t>
    IPv4 addresses used for tests and in examples are specified in
    <xref target="I-D.iana-rfc3330bis" />, IPv6 addresses used in
    examples are described in <xref target="RFC3849" />.
</t><t>
    The key words "MAY", "RECOMMENDED", and "SHOULD" in this memo
    are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.
</t></section>

<section title="TLDs for Testing, &amp; Documentation Examples"><t>
    There is a need for top level domain (TLD) names that can be used for
    creating names which, without fear of conflicts with current or
    future actual TLD names in the global DNS, can be used for private
    testing of existing DNS related code, examples in documentation, DNS
    related experimentation, invalid DNS names, or other similar uses.
</t><t>
    For example, without guidance, a site might set up some local
    additional unused top level domains for testing of its local DNS code
    and configuration. Later, these TLDs might come into actual use on
    the global Internet.  As a result, local attempts to reference the
    real data in these zones could be thwarted by the local test
    versions.  Or test or example code might be written that accesses a
    TLD that is in use with the thought that the test code would only be
    run in a restricted testbed net or the example never actually run.
    Later, the test code could escape from the testbed or the example be
    actually coded and run on the Internet. Depending on the nature of
    the test or example, it might be best for it to be referencing a TLD
    permanently reserved for such purposes.
</t><t>
    To safely satisfy these needs, four domain names are reserved as
    listed and described below.  See also <xref target="i18n" />.

</t><section title='".example"' anchor="example"><t>
    ".example" is RECOMMENDED for use in documentation or as examples.

</t></section><section title='".invalid"'><t>
    ".invalid" is intended for use in online construction of domain
    names that are sure to be invalid, and for which it is obvious at
    a glance that they are invalid. Applications MAY treat ".invalid"
    as what the name says.

</t></section><section title='".localhost"'><t>
    The ".localhost" TLD has traditionally been statically defined in
    host DNS implementations as having an A record pointing to the
    loop back IP address and is reserved for such use.  Any other use
    would conflict with widely deployed code which assumes this use.

</t></section><section title='".test"' anchor="test"><t>
    ".test" is RECOMMENDED for use in testing of current or new DNS
    related code. Applications SHOULD treat ".test" like any other
    TLD; a special handling could defeat the purpose of a test.

</t></section></section>

<section title="Reserved Example Second Level Domain Names"><t>
    The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) also reserves the
    three second level domain names ".example.com", ".example.net",
    and ".example.org", which can be used in examples as explained
    in <xref target="example" />.
</t><t>
    When TLDs offer further second level domains for examples, the
    TLD administrators are encouraged to publish the relevant policies
    in their TLD as an informational RFC.
</t><t>
    The second level domain names "nic", "whois", and "www" are often
    reserved or used for administrative purposes of the TLD, e.g.,
    "whois.example" for the fully qualified domain name of a host with
    a whois server.  As with second level domains for examples this
    can be an issue in the case of a TLD redelegation.
</t></section>

<section title="Internationalization Considerations" anchor="i18n"><t>
    In 2007 IANA created eleven TLDs for tests of Internationalized
    Domain Names (IDN). The A-labels and corresponding languages are
    listed below; see <xref target="RFC3490" /> or its
    <xref target="IDNAbis" /> successor for
    details about IDN. Applications SHOULD treat these IDN test TLDs
    as explained in <xref target="test" />.

<section title="Security Considerations"><t>
    Confusion and conflict can be caused by the use of a current or
    future top level domain name in experimentation or testing, as an
    example in documentation, to indicate invalid names, or as a synonym
    for the loop back address.  Test and experimental software can escape
    and end up being run against the global operational DNS.  Even
    examples used "only" in documentation can end up being coded and
    released or cause conflicts due to later real use and the possible
    acquisition of intellectual property rights in such "example" names.
</t><t>
    The reservation of several top level domain names for these purposes
    minimizes such confusion and conflict.
</t><t>
    <xref target="RFC4367" /> discusses various false assumptions based
    on domain labels, however this doesn't affect the reserved TLDs in
    this memo.
</t><t>
    Readers need to be aware that the IANA registry of reserved TLDs in
    <xref target="iana" /> won't list all reserved TLDs for specific
    applications and protocols, e.g., <xref target="RFC2965" />. The
    registry can only list reserved TLDs if (1) somebody bothered to
    propose it, typically in an Internet-Draft, and (2) the proposal
    was accepted in an IETF review.
</t></section>

<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana"><t>
    IANA reserves the TLDs ".example", ".invalid", ".localhost", ".test",
    and eleven IDN test TLDs as noted above. IANA reserves the second
    level domains ".example.com", ".example.net", and ".example.org".
</t><t>
    IANA creates a registry of reserved TLDs; this can be done alongside
    existing IANA TLD registries at the discretion of IANA.  The registry
    should contain references to the relevant specifications, for the
    fifteen reserved TLDs mentioned above references to this memo will do.
</t><t>
    Additional reserved TLDs require IETF review as specified in
    <xref target="RFC5226" /> in conjunction with <xref target="RFC2860" />.

        Changes in version 02:
    </t><t>
        <list style="symbols"><t>
            Added the related <xref target="RFC3849" /> and
            <xref target="I-D.iana-rfc3330bis" /> references.
            Added an <xref target="RFC4367" /> reference to the security
            considerations, as this explains one of many issues with any
            "well-known" label below the top level.
        </t><t>
            IDN test SLDs not yet added, it is not clear if they are also
            reserved TLDs. Any "globally reserved labels" at other levels
            including the second level would be utter dubious.
        </t><t>
            Improved the IANA Considerations <xref target="iana" /> based
            on feedback.  The registry of reserved TLDs needs references
            to the relevant specifications.
        </t><t>
            So far nobody insisted on listing the corresponding U-labels
            for the eleven IDN test TLDs.  TBD, it is an editorial layout
            issue, and somebody offering to check the BiDi U-labels would
            be great.
        </t><t>
            Added a caveat that the IANA registry of reserved TLDs cannot
            list all obscure ideas of specific applications and protocols;
            somebody has to trigger an IETF review for new registrations.
            The author refuses to discuss UUCP and LOCAL in this memo, but
            added <xref target="RFC2965" /> as a dubious example, willing
            to pull it again as soon as somebody says "make it so". :-)
        </t></list>
    </t><t>
        Changes in version 01:
    </t><t>
        <list style="symbols"><t>
            Various editorial issues found by Tony Hansen fixed.
        </t><t>
            Added <xref target="IDNAbis" /> reference. The author believes
            that the IETF is not entitled to decree that ".example.edu"
            belongs to the set of three example-SLDs reserved by IANA.
        </t></list>
    </t><t>
        Changes in version 00:
    </t><t>
        <list style="symbols"><t>
            John Klensin suggested clarifying the guidelines for
            examples in <xref target="RFC2606" />, referenced by
            <eref target="http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html" />.
            Documenting the eleven new IDN test TLDs was anyway
            desirable.
