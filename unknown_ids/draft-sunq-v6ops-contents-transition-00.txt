Internet-Draft             Contents Transition                  May 2011


1.  Introduction

   The global IPv4 address depletion becomes a reality.  Although the
   IPv4 to IPv6 transition is considered inevitable, deployments of IPv6
   are still quite limited as this document is written.  Facing the
   pressure of IPv4 address shortage, the operaters may like to provide
   services through IPv6 in some wayes.  However, compared to the
   readiness of operaters' infrastructures, the IPv6 transition on the
   content provider and end user sides moves even more slowly.

   There have been statements from several popular content providers
   that they have turned on, or planned to turn on IPv6 soon, which do
   have a beneficial effect on encouraging end users to transit to
   IPv6.  While given the operational cost and the risk to the
   continuity of service delivery, compared to the number of active IPv6
   users currently, it is difficult to convince much more content
   providers (especially conservative ones and, the great many ones of
   small-to-medium size) to immediately enable IPv6 and make their
   publically-facing services accessible through IPv6 natively.  On the
   other hand, from the users' perspective the IPv6 reachability of
   resources required for their daily lives is one of the foremost
   factors that they concern when making the decision on whether or not
   to access Internet using IPv6.  It is a chicken or egg dilemma, but
   the two perspectives are interdependent.  If the transition of one
   side passes the point of inflexion, the other side will be speeded up
   after.  So, more efforts are needed to encourage the IPv6 adoption
   and reach the point.

   This document describes one deployment model of
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful], aiming at rapidly increasing
   the amount of IPv6 reachable contents for users from IPv6 Internet.
   The contents can be still accessible through IPv4.  While this must
   not be used as a long-term solution, and the native transition of
   contents should always be recommended.

           +----------------+                   +--------------+

   The NAT64 gateway is deployed between the IPv6 Internet and the IPv4
   server.  An IPv6 prefix is assigned to embed the IPv4 addresses of
   the server then form IPv6 addresses (per [RFC6052]) which are used
   for AAAA records adding.  The route of the IPv6 prefix should be
   advertised by the NAT64 gateway to IPv6 Internet.  Also, an IPv4
   address pool is needed on the Xlate to translate IPv6 packets to
   IPv4.  Private addresses (e.g. 10/8) may be used.


3.  Overall procedure

   Before initiating a session, generally an IPv6 user will do a DNS
   lookup to get the AAAA records and learn the addresses of the host to
   be accessed.  In this case, the IPv6 addresses learned through AAAA
   records are those translated from the IPv4 addresses of the server.

   In this deployment model, the NAT64 gateway will perform the
   translation from IPv6 to IPv4, and vice versa.  The communication is
   initiated by the IPv6 side.  When an IPv6 packet arrives, a lookup of
   the mapping table will take place to get the IPv4 address used for
   translation.  If there is no one matched, a new entry will be
   created.

   1:1 mapping is employed in the context of this deployment model,
   which would simplify the packet processing procedure.Then, the
   translated packet with private IPv4 address would be sent to the IPv4
   server.

4.  5. Deployment Considerations

4.1.  Stateful Translation

   The translation functions are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful], which allows clients from IPv6
   Internet to contact IPv4 server in Data Center.

4.2.  Addressing and mapping

   To save global IPv4 addresses which become scarce resources, private
   blocks, for instance 10.0.0.0/8 can be used by the NAT64 gateway for
   Stateful NAT64 operations.  Since the scenario of server side is
   different from that of client side and considering the capacity of
   devices for the scale of traffic in the foreseeable future, we choose
   1:1 address mapping (one IPv6 address mapped to one private IPv4
   address).  In this way, the problems introduced by address sharing
   could be avoided and the efficiency of NAT64 operations could be
   improved (Refer to Section 4.4 for capacity considerations).

   Note that Conflicts might happen when the same private address space
   is used for the interconnection of servers internally. (e.g., for
   Load Balancing)

   An IPv6 prefix is needed to represent the IPv4 servers, and the route
   of the prefix should be advertised to the IPv6 Internet.

4.3.  DNS

   Correspondingly, the AAAA records are needed to serve the end users
   from IPv6 Internet.  Two methods could be considered: deploying the
   DNS64 along with the NAT64 gateway to respond the queries from IPv6
   Internet with dynamically formed AAAA records; manually adding AAAA
   records based on translated addresses into the authorized name
   servers, some auto-configuration tools may be used.

   ...

4.4.  Capacity

   In theory, about 16 million sessions can be established
   simultaneously if for example the 10.0.0.0/8 block is used for 1:1
   stateful NAT64 in the configured-lifetime.

4.5.  Traffic Logging and User Management

   Traffic logging and user management is important.  Since only 1:1
   addressing mapping is used in this model, traffic logging system will

   be substaintially simplified to record IPv6 end-user address,
   translated IPv4 address, timestamp and lifetime.

   The traffic statistics can be used by content providers as a
   reference when setting out the timetable of native transition.

4.6.  ALG

   Only limited ALGs need to be deployed in NAT64 gateway according to
   the services provided.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   Some malicious attackers can send a large number of IPv6 packets with
   different forged source IPv6 addresses, to rapidly deplete the IPv4
   address pool, which is a kind of DOS attack.
