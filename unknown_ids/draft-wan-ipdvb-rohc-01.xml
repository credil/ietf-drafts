            Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE), RFC4326 to carry
            packets compressed with RObust Header Compression (ROHC), RFC 3095

    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
            Header compression promotes efficient use of available bandwidth.
            This is more apparent in the case of DVB-S where satellite link is
            used. This document introduces a method to compress headers of IP 
            packet encapsulated within ULE <xref target="RFC4326"/> Stream 
            using ROHC framework <xref target="RFC3095"/>. 
        </t>

        <t>
            Important concepts of ROHC channel in MPEG2-TS system is
            introduced to differentiate between normal, uncompressed ULE Stream 
            from ROHC compressed stream. Method to map outgoing packet to a ROHC
            channel is also presented. For completeness, a protocol to automate 
            the negotiation and setup of parameters for ROHC channel is discussed.
        </t>
        
        <t>
            This document doesn't try to address compression of broadcast or
            multicast traffic for there is no reliable way to handle ROHC
            feedback from multiple ROHC decompressor. Implementation that wants
            to enable ROHC compression for broadcast or multicast traffic must
            ensure that all recipient gateways are capable of decompressing ROHC
            packet and that all contexts for broadcast and multicast traffic
            must operate in unidirectional mode.

            Compressor gateways and decompressor gateways are connected through
            unidirectional links. This document assumes that these unidirectional 
            links carry IP packets within ULE over MPEG2-TS frames. A 
            unidirectional link from a compressor gateway may have multiple 
            decompressor gateways listening to it. The following figure depicts 
            a generic topology of a compressor gateway, Comp1, with 2 decompressor 
            gateways, Decomp 1 and Decomp 2.

        <t>
            Each decompressor gateway has a dedicated unidirectional link
            connected to compressor gateway. Each unidirectional link may
            contain multiple logical channels which is identified by the PID 
            field of MPEG2-TS frame. Of these logical channels, some of these 
            logical channels may be dedicated for traffic of ROHC compressed 
            packets only. While the rest of the logical channels may be used to 
            carry uncompressed packets. 
        </t>
        <t>
            For the purpose of this discussion, the group of logical channels 
            used to carry streams of uncompressed packets are called 
            uncompressed channels. Uncompressed channel is not reserved 
            exclusively between a pair of gateways and may be shared by multiple
            receiver gateways.
        </t>
        <t>
            ROHC channel is a logical channel that is used to carry ROHC 
            compressed packet from compressor gateway to decompressor gateway.
            ROHC channel is exclusive to a pair of compressor gateway and 
            decompressor gateway.
        </t>
        <t>
            ROHC feedback channel is the logical channel that carries ROHC
            feedback packet from decompressor gateway to compressor gateway.
            This channel is optional. This channel may be shared by co-located 
            compressor at the decompressor gateway to send ROHC compressed 
            packet. When used in this manner, ROHC feedback channel of
            decompressor and ROHC channel of co-located compressor at the
            decompressor gateway share the same logical channel.
        </t>
        <t>
            However, in the absence of co-located compressor at the decompressor
            gateway, ROHC feedback doesn't necessitate a dedicated logical 
            channel as it can be sent via uncompressed channel in the encapsulation
            format depicted in <xref target="feedback"/>. As such, ROHC 
            feedback channel is not an exclusive channel and may be a part 
            uncompressed channel or ROHC channel.
        </t>
        <t>
            <xref target="topology2"/> depicts a possible combination of logical 
            channels for the topology shown in <xref target="topology1"/>. The
            following topology assumes that there is no co-located compressor
            at both decompressor gateways and ROHC feedbacks are sent back
            through uncompressed channel.

        To get a better understanding of the terminologies used in subsequent
        sections, <xref target="bidirectional_topo"/> depicts a topology of 2 
        gateways with both compressor and decompressor. Comp 1 is the compressor 
        for Gateway 1 whereas Decomp 1 is the decompressor for Gateway 1. So is 
        Comp 2 and Decomp 2 for Gateway 2. Comp 1 and Decomp 1 are co-located 
        and associated. The arrow sign from Decomp 1 to Comp 1 means that ROHC
        feedback is being forwarded from Decomp 1 to Comp 1. Decomp 2 is the
        corresponding decompressor of compressor Comp 1. ROHC feedback from
        Decomp 2 can be sent back to Comp 1 through ROHC channel established
        between Comp 2 and Decomp 1.

                The same concept applies for compressed bridge frame PDUs.
                However, the Ethernet header is left untouch. Only the headers
                after the Ethernet frame header are compressed. Decompressed

                of IP header is not present in compressed header and may confuse

                The rationale of reusing existing ULE type to carry ROHC
                compressed packets is twofold:
                <list style="numbers">
                <t>
                    Decompressor gateway can recognize the content of SNDU
                    easily and handle the SNDU in the same way as its
                    uncompressed counterpart after the PDU is decompressed.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The framework will be more extensible. If in the future,
                    when new ULE types are introduced to carry SNDU that can be
                    compressed by ROHC, these new ULE types can be used again to
                    cover for its ROHC compressed counterparts.
                </t>
                </list>
                There can be no ambiguity as to whether a SNDU is carrying
                ROHC compressed PDU or uncompressed SNDU because ROHC compressed
                PDU can only exist in ROHC channel.

                It should be noted that ROHC feedback may be embedded within a
                ROHC compressed packet and doesn't necessarily have to be sent in
                the format presented in <xref target="feedback"/>.

            <t>
                As discussed earlier, ROHC feedback may be sent through ULE
                channel from decompressor gateway. However, there may be
                multiple gateways receiving that particular uncompressed channel.
                To uniquely identify the receiving gateway, Receiver Destination NPA
                Address field must be used to store the Address of the compressor
                gateway when ROHC feedback sent through uncompressed channel.
            </t>
            <t>
                If, however, there is a dedicated ROHC channel from decompressor
                gateway to compressor gateway, Receiver Destination NPA Address
                need not be used. This is situation may occur when there is a 
                co-located compressor at the decompressor gateway with a 
                corresponding decompressor at the compressor gateway like the 
                example shown in <xref target="bidirectional_topo"/>. Therefore, 
                if a decompressor gateway need to send ROHC feedback, it should 
                do so through ROHC channel if one is available.

            Since there may be more than one gateway listening to a transmission,
            a gateway may need to setup multiple ROHC channels each for a
            listening gateways. Before a gateway can compress a packet, it needs
            to decide the right recipient gateway. If not, the gateway won't be
            able to determine which ROHC compressor to use, thereby the right ROHC
            channel to use. Thus, a gateway that wishes to send ROHC compressed
            packet need to learn the topology of its network.
        </t>
        <t>
            The following subsection will present a simple technique for a 
            gateway to learn about topology of its network. Implementation of 
            this document may choose to use any other technique to inform the 
            gateway about the topology of the network.

                Since a gateway needs to listen incoming traffic of other peer
                gateways through individual frontend of DVB receiver card for 
                each peer gateway. Thus each frontend must be mapped to a
                corresponding ROHC channel exclusively.
            </t>
            <t>
                When an incoming packet arrives at a frontend, the source 
                address for the packet will need to be identified. The source
                address may be source IP address of IPv4 and IPv6 PDU or 
                source MAC address of a bridged frame SNDU. Collectively, these
                source addresses are mapped to the ROHC channel that corresponds 
                to this frontend.

            <t>
                When compressor gateway needs to send a packet, it needs to
                identify the destination address of the packet. The destination
                may be destination IP address of IPv4 and IPv6 PDU  or
                destination MAC address of a bridged frame SNDU. The compressor
                gateway then need to look for a ROHC channel that has a matching
                address with this destination address. If a match is found,
                the ROHC channel and its corresponding ROHC compressor will be
                used to compress and send the packet. If no match is found,
                compressor gateway must send the packet uncompressed through
                uncompressed channel.

            This document presents an approach to setup ROHC channel over DVB
            links through a negotiation protocol. Implementation of the
            protocol mentioned in this document is not strictly required,
            implementors may choose to have static configuration for the
            operation of ROHC compression and decompression.

            <t>
                This protocol works through ULE Streams only. It is possible to
                modify this protocol to work on Generic Stream Encapsulation <xref
                target="GSE" /> in the future. While it is possible to extend
                this protocol to work over asymmetrical link, this draft doesn't
                try to address this issue. Since new EtherType can be allocated,
                this protocol can be extended to asymmetrical link via
                Link-Layer Tunneling Mechanism <xref target="RFC3077" /> with
                little modifications. The ULE SNDUs defined in this section
                should be sent within uncompressed channel.
            </t>

                The skeleton format of a ULE SNDU packet for RCPNP message is as
                such:

                                        This value of this field should be less

                                        CIDs will be encoded using small CID 
                                        presentation for the ROHC channel.

                                        ROHC framework reserves most significant
                                        octet of profile ID to denote the version
                                        number of a ROHC profile. Due to this
                                        constraint, there can only be 256
                                        active profiles per channel. 
                                        Therefore, this field occupies 1 octet
                                        instead of 2. Decompressor site should 
                                        send a NACK if it receives more profile 
                                        IDs than it can support.

                                        The compressor will set this field to 0
                                        if none of profile negotiated in Request 
                                        message can be supported. Upon receiving 
                                        this reply, decompressor should discard
                                        any stored information of negotiated 
                                        ROHC channel parameters. Neither

                                        compressor site doesn't expect one. 
                                        However, decompressor site may start a

   <section title="Bidirectional ROHC Channels">
       <t>
           While establishing bidirectional ROHC channels allows for the use of
           ROHC bidirectional optimistic mode and bidirectional reliable mode,
           RCPNP doesn't concern itself with the  establishment of bidirectional
           ROHC channels. Therefore, it is up to  implementers of this protocol
           to support bidirectional ROHC channels. The implementation should be
           as straightforward as mapping correct pair of ROHC channels.
        </t>
        <t>
            Bidirectional ROHC channels must be formed whenever possible by
            associating co-located compressor and decompressor. If co-located
            compressor and decompressor are not associated, decompressor won't
            be able to parse any ROHC compressed packet that piggyback ROHC 
            feedback properly since it doesn't know the size of CID within the 
            piggybacked ROHC feedback.

    <section title="Acknowledgements">
        <t>
            We would like to extend our gratitude to Dr. Gorry Fairhurst for his
            guidance.
        </t>
        <t>
            We also want to thank Rod Walsh (Nokia) for his valuable input and

    <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>
            Technique presented in <xref target="learning"/> allows for DoS. A 
            malicious site may send packet with a fake source address
            matching an address that belongs to a victim site. The
            compressor gateway upon receiving such malicious packet may be 
            fooled about the recipient gateway and thus the intended packet may
            not be received by victim site once it goes through the wrong
            ROHC channel.
        </t>
        <t>
            To mitigate this problem, compressor gateway that receives such 
            suspicious packets with similar source address coming from 
            different frontends of DVB receiver should disable compression 
            and send all packets uncompressed via uncompressed channel when 
            transmitting packets with the destination address.
