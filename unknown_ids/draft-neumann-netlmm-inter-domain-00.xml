      <t>This document specifies mechanisms to setup and maintain handover and

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>A mobile node in the current Internet needs to maintain a fixed
      endpoint when it moves to allow for seamless connectivity with its
      corresponding nodes. When the mobile nodes moves between network-based
      mobility domains that are under different administrative control, this
      becomes challenging. One network is responsible for the communication
      endpoint while the other network provides the actual mobility services
      to the mobile node. This document proposes an approach to solve this
      problem by using inter-domain signaling to setup session handover and
      data forwarding between the different domains.</t>

      <t>A network-based localized mobility management solution like Proxy
      Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) <xref target="I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6"></xref>
      provides a mobile node with mobility within the PMIPv6-enabled domain it
      is deployed in. When the mobile node leaves the network, however, the
      mobility support breaks since the mobile node moves out of the
      administrative reach of the local mobility solution.</t>

        <t>Mobility Session<list style="empty">
            <t>The period of time in which the mobile node needs mobility
            support from the network. If the mobile node reaches a state where
            it currently does not need mobility support, the mobility session
            can safely be reset. During a mobility session the network-based
            mobility solution described in this document offers the mobile a
            fixed end-point for its communications, namely the session
            mobility anchor, which stays valid even when the mobile node moves
            between Proxy Mobile IP domains.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Session Mobility Anchor<list style="empty">
            <t>A fixed end-point which relays all the communication for the
            mobile node. This is the local mobility anchor of the first Proxy
            Mobile IP domain that a mobile node is connected to during a
            mobility session.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>In order to provide continuous mobility support for a mobile nodes
      that is moving between different mobility domains, a steady anchor point
      has to be provided for corresponding nodes. In Mobile IP, for example,
      this is the home agent while in Proxy Mobile IP this is the local
      mobility anchor (LMA). This anchor point allows the mobile node to
      change its point of attachment to a network without its corresponding
      nodes noticing that. All the mobile node's traffic is routed through the
      local mobility anchor which then forwards the traffic to the mobile
      node. When a mobile node leaves a Proxy Mobile IP domain, however, it
      moves beyond the control of the local mobility anchor and therefore its
      mobility breaks.</t>

      <t>When a mobile node initially attaches to a Proxy Mobile IP domain,
      the local mobility anchor becomes the session mobility anchor (SMA) for
      the mobile node. For the duration of the mobility session this session
      mobility anchor will handle all incoming and outgoing connections for
      the mobile node. As long as the mobile node stays within the local Proxy
      Mobile IP domain, this only includes regular Proxy Mobile IPv6
      operations as described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6"></xref>. When the mobile node leaves
      the local Proxy Mobile IP domain, however, the new Proxy Mobile IP
      domain's local mobility anchor will initialize a tunnel to the session
      mobility anchor to allow the session mobility anchor to continue serving
      as an anchor point for the mobile node. Within the new Proxy Mobile IP
      domain all regular Proxy Mobile IP operations still apply with the
      exception that all traffic for the mobile node is tunneled from the new
      local mobility anchor to the session mobility anchor which in turn
      communicates with the correspondent node.</t>

      <t>For all intends and purposes from the point of view of the session
      mobility anchor, the current local mobility anchor of a mobile node can
      be seen as a mobile access gateway which performs the corresponding
      operations.</t>

      <section title="Finding the session mobility anchor">
        <t>When a mobile node attaches to a Proxy Mobile IP domain, the local
        mobility anchor of this domain has to locate the session mobility
        anchor for this mobile node and initiate a tunnel between itself and
        the session mobility anchor. In case the Proxy Mobile IP domain is the
        first domain the mobile node attaches to within its mobility session,
        the current local mobility anchor becomes the session mobility anchor
        and continues with its regular Proxy Mobile IP operations. If the
        mobile node already has been attached to a different Proxy Mobile IP
        domain, it's session mobility anchor resides within this previous
        domain and the local mobility anchor needs to establish a binding with
        the session mobility anchor in order to send and receive the data for
        the mobile node through its session mobility anchor. Depending on the
        scenario, the local mobility anchor can directly or indirectly locate
        the session mobility anchor for a mobile node.</t>

        <section title="Direct location">
          <t>Direct location of a session mobility anchor for a mobile node
          requires some kind of look-up between associated Proxy Mobile IP
          domains. For example, this can be achieved by maintaining a common
          database where session mobility anchors deposit the information for
          which mobile node they are responsible for. Such a database can be
          established by service level agreements between the operators of
          Proxy Mobile IP domains. For a local mobility anchor to locate the
          session mobility anchor for a mobile node it will send a look-up
          request to the database using the mobile node's identity (e.g. its
          Network Access Identifier (NAI) <xref target="RFC4282"></xref>) as
          the look-up key. If the database does not have an entry for the
          mobile node, the local mobility anchor becomes the session mobility
          anchor for the mobility session of the mobile node.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Indirect location">
          <t>If no common database exists between Proxy Mobile IP domains, the
          local mobility anchor can use an indirect scheme to locate the
          session mobility anchor of a mobile node. For this purpose, the
          local mobility anchor infers the session mobility anchor assigned IP
          address of the mobile node and uses this address to send its session
          transfer request to. Since the session mobility anchor is
          responsible for this IP address, the local mobility anchor will
          indirectly reach the session mobility anchor. If there is no reply
          to the request, the local mobility anchor must assume that no
          previous session mobility anchor exists and itself become the
          session mobility anchor for the mobility session of the mobile node.
          The session mobility anchor assigned IP address of a mobile node is
          the IP address the mobile node got assigned when it initially
          attached to a Proxy Mobile IP domain. The local mobility anchor can
          try to infer this IP address, for example, by analyzing the mobile
          node's Router Solicitation messages <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>
          or DHCP requests <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Assumptions">
        <t>This document assumes that there are some operational agreements
        between the operators of the different Proxy Mobile IP domains. Part
        of this agreement are, for example, the conditions under which users
        are allowed to move between domains and the location method that is
        used to find the session mobility anchor.</t>

        <t>Figure <xref target="figure_signal_flow"></xref> shows the
        signaling flow when a mobile node attaches to a Proxy Mobile IP
        domain. As in the normal Proxy Mobile IP case, the mobile node sends a
        Router Solicitation message that is received by the local mobile
        access gateway. The mobile access gateway then sends its Proxy Binding
        Update (PBU) to the local mobility anchor. To register itself with the
        session mobility anchor as the new local mobility anchor for the
        mobile node, the local mobility anchor forwards this Proxy Binding
        Update to the session mobility anchor. The session mobility anchor
        then determines the corresponding policies for the mobile node as it
        would for a local mobile node and constructs the Proxy Binding
        Acknowledgment (PBA). The Proxy Binding Acknowledgment is then sent to
        the local mobility anchor as if it were a local mobile access gateway
        and a bi-directional tunnel is established between the session
        mobility anchor and the local mobility anchor. The local mobility
        anchor forwards the received Proxy Binding Acknowledgment to its
        mobile access gateway which in turn uses the Proxy Binding
        Acknowledgment to configure the mobile node. Also, the local mobility
        anchor establishes the bi-direct tunnel to this mobile access gateway.
        All traffic for the mobile node is then routed from the session
        mobility anchor through the local mobility anchor and the mobile
        access gateway. All future movements of the mobile node within the new
        Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain are covered by local mobility operations as
        described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Local routing">
        <t>Traffic might occur between nodes that are currently allocated in
        the same mobility domain but are associated with session mobility
        anchors outside this domain. The local mobility anchor of the domain
        MAY optimize the delivery of this traffic by locally routing the
        packets instead of sending them over the corresponding session
        mobility anchor(s). The flag EnableMAGLocalRouting MAY be used for
        controlling this behavior. For further local routing considerations,
        see Section 6.10.3. of the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) document <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="Inter-Domain security">
      <t>This document introduces signaling and data forwarding between
      different Proxy Mobile IP domains which needs to be protected. Proxy
      Mobile IP itself recommends using IPsec with established security
      associations to protect the signaling messages, Proxy Binding Update and
      Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message exchanges between the mobile access
      gateway and the local mobility anchor. This document extends this
      recommendation for all message exchanges between the session mobility
      anchor and the local mobility anchor including forwarded data for the
      mobile node. How the IPsec associations are established is beyond this
      document.</t>

    <section anchor="section_security_considerations"
             title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This section deals with the considerations related to intra-domain
      security within one Proxy Mobile IP domain and inter-domain security
      between different Proxy Mobile IP domains that are involved in managing
      a mobile nodes mobility.</t>

      <section title="Intra-domain securtiy considerations">
        <t>This document does not change any intra-domain mobility procedures
        and therefore does not introduce additional intra-domain security
        risks. The security considerations in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-netlmm-proxymip6"></xref> cover security risks inside
        a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Inter-domain security considerations">
        <t>The signaling and data forwarding between different Proxy Mobile IP
        domains where the session mobility anchor resides in one domain and
        the current local mobility anchor for a mobile node resides in the
        other domain is recommended to be protected by using IPsec with
        established security associations. This means that the local mobility
        anchor establishes and maintains an IPsec tunnel to the session
        mobility anchor which is used for communications. How these security
        associations are established is beyond this document. It is
        recommended, however, to establish some kind of service agreements
        between service providers to specify security constraints and to
        arrange the valid endpoints (i.e. the local mobility anchor and
        session mobility anchor addresses).</t>

        <t>In opposite to plain Proxy Mobile IPv6, the signaling between the
        session mobility anchor and the mobile node traverses not only the
        Internet but also the local network of the current Proxy Mobile IP
        domain. The signaling between the session mobility anchor and the
        mobile node is, therefore, at least exposed to the current local
        mobility anchor, and the corresponding mobile access gateways in the
        current Proxy Mobile IP domain. Especially for applicable
        authentication procedures between the session mobility anchor and the
        mobile node, the session mobility anchor is recommended to only use
        procedures that cannot be exploited by overhearing parties.</t>
