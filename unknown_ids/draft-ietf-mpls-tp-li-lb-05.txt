1. Introduction 

   This document specifies one function and describes another function 
   which are applicable to MPLS transport networks. 
    
   The first function enables an operator to lock a transport path.  The 
   second function enables an operator to set that transport path in 
   loopback at a specified node along the path. This document also 
   defines the extensions to the MPLS operation, administration and 
   maintenance (OAM) to perform the lock function.

   The Lock function pertains to Label Switched Paths (LSPs), 
   Pseudowires(including multi-segment Pseudowires) and Sections. As per 
   RFC 5860 [1], lock is an administrative state in which it is expected 
   that no client traffic may be carried. 
   However, test traffic and OAM messages dedicated to the transport 
   path can be mapped on that transport path. 
 
   Taking the example of an LSP, lock is initiated by an operator. 
   Typically when an LSP is locked, both ends of the LSP are 
   independently locked by the operator. It is often difficult to 
   coordinate these lock operations within a tight window. This document 
   defines a new OAM message, Lock Instruct (LI) in order to provide the 
   desired tight coordination. 
 
   When an endpoint of an LSP or PW is locked by an operator, the MEP 
   sends LI messages to its peer MEP. An endpoint considers the LSP to 
   be locked when either it receives an external operator command or 
   when it receives an LI message.    
    
   The Lock function can be performed using an extension to the MPLS OAM 
   as described in the next sections. This is a common mechanism to lock 
   PWs, LSPs and Sections. 
    
   The Lock function can as well be realized using a management plane. 
    
   The Loopback function is operated by NMS from MEP to MEP on 
   bidirectional (associated and co-routed) Label Switched Paths (LSPs),  
   Pseudowires (including multi-segment Pseudowires) and Sections. The 
   Loopback function is additionally operated from MEP to MIP on co-
   routed bidirectional LSPs, on multi-segment Pseudowires and Sections. 
   The Loopback is a function that enables a MEP to request a MEP or a 
   MIP to enter a loopback state. This state corresponds to the 
   situation where, at a given node, a forwarding plane loop is 
   configured and the incoming direction of a transport path is cross-
   connected to the outgoing reverse direction. Therefore, except in the 
   case of early TTL expiry, traffic sent by the source will be received 
   by that source. Note that before setting a given node in Loopback for 
   a specific transport path, this transport path MUST be locked. 
 
   Data plane loopback is an out-of-service function, as required in 
   section 2.2.5 of RFC 5860 [1]. This function loops back all traffic 
   (including user data and OAM). The traffic can be originated from one

   internal point at the ingress of a transport path within an interface 
   or inserted from input port of an interface using an external test 
   equipment. The traffic is looped back unmodified (other than normal 
   per hop processing such as TTL decrement) in the direction of the 
   point of origin by an interface at either an intermediate node or a 
   terminating node. It should be noted that data plane loopback 
   function itself is applied to data plane loopback points that can 
   resides on different interfaces from MIPs/MEPs. All traffic 
   (including both payload and OAM) received on the looped back 
   interface is sent on the reverse direction of the transport path.  
    
   If the data plane loopback point is set somewhere at an intermediate 
   point in bidirectional transport path, the side of loop back function 
   (one side or both side) needs to be configured. A management system 
   can configure one side or both sides to loopback at an intermediate 
   point. 
 
   The Loopback can be performed using a management plane. Management 
   plane MUST insure that the two MEPs are locked before performing the 
   loopback function. 
    

   The Lock function is based on a new G-ACH message using a new channel 
   type as well as an existing TLV. 

   When an LSP is locked, the management or control function is expected 
   to lock both ends. The purpose of the Lock instruct LI message is to 
   ensure the tight coordination of locking and unlocking the two ends. 
   Lock Instruct messages may be lost during looping or maintenance 
   operations, thus locking both ends is required, before such 
   operations occur.

3. Lock Message 

3.1. Message Identification 

   The proposed mechanism uses a new code point in the Associated 
   Channel Header (ACH) described in [4].   

  The LI channel is identified by the ACH as defined in RFC 5586 [4] 
  with the Channel Type set to the LI code point = 0xHH.  [HH to be 
  assigned by IANA from the PW Associated Channel Type registry]  The 
  LI Channel does not use ACH TLVs and MUST NOT include the ACH TLV 
  header. The LI ACH Channel is shown below. 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3

   Version: The Version Number is currently 1.  (Note: the version 
   number is to be incremented whenever a change is made that affects 
   the ability of an implementation to correctly parse or process the 
   message. These changes include any syntactic or semantic changes made 
   to any of the fixed fields, or to any Type-Length-Value (TLV) or sub-
   TLV assignment or format that is defined at a certain version number.  
   The version number may not need to be changed if an optional TLV or 
   sub-TLV is added.) 

   Refresh Timer: The maximum time between successive LI messages 
   specified in seconds.  The default value is 1.  The value 0 is not 
   permitted. When a lock is applied, a refresh timer is chosen.  This 
   value MUST NOT be changed for the duration of that lock. 

   MEP Source ID TLV: This is the "CC/CV MEP ID TLV" defined in [3]. 

4. Lock, Loopback and maintenance operations 

   When an LSP is locked, the management or control function is expected 
   to lock both ends. The purpose of the LI message is to ensure the 
   tight coordination of locking and unlocking the two ends.  LI 
   messages may be lost during looping or maintenance operations, thus 
   locking both ends is required, before such operations occur. 

   When a transport path is put in loopback, traffic sent from the 
   sender MEP will be looped back to that sender MEP. OAM packets not 
   intercepted by TTL expiry will as well be looped back. The use of 
   traffic to measure packet loss, delay and delay variation is outside 
   the scope of this document. 

5. Operation 

5.1. Lock Operation 

   Lock is used to request a MEP to take a transport path out of service   
   so that some form of maintenance can be done or other administrative   
   reasons.   

   When performing a lock, a sender MEP in response to a management 
   system request MUST take the transport path out of service and MUST 
   send LI messages periodically to the target MEP at the end of the

Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-tp-li-lb-05.txt       September 2011 
   transport path. LI messages will be sent once every refresh time 
   interval. 

   The receiver MEP, will lock the transport path as long as it is 
   receiving the periodic LI messages. 

   The receiver MEP once locked, MUST take the transport path out of 
   service. 

   A MEP can be locked because it was requested by NMS to lock and as 
   such it is sending LI OAM messages, and/or it is receiving OAM LI 
   messages from the other MEP.  

5.2. UnLock Operation 

   Unlock is used to request a MEP to bring the previously locked 
   transport path back in service. 

   When a MEP is unlocked via management or control it MUST cease 
   sending LI messages. Further, it must have stopped receiving LI 
   messages for a period of 3.5 times the previously received refresh 
   timer before it brings the transport path back in service. 

   A MEP would unlock transport path and put it back to service if and 
   only if there is no management request to lock the path and it is not 
   receiving in-band LI messages. 

   A MEP is unlocked when there is no NMS request to Lock and no LI OAM 
   messages are received. 

5.3. General Procedures 

   When taking a transport path out of service, the operation MUST first 
   be preceded by a lock operation.  

5.4. Example Topology 

   The next sections discuss the procedures for locking, Unlocking a 
   transport path.  Assume a transport path traverses nodes A <--> B <--
   > C <--> D.  We will refer to the Maintenance Entities involved as 
   MEP-A, MIP-B, MIP-C, and MEP-D respectively. Suppose a maintenance 
   operation invoked at MEP-A requires to lock the transport path.  

   The following sections describe MEP-A setting and unsetting a lock at   
   MEP-D.

Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-tp-li-lb-05.txt       September 2011 
5.5. Locking a transport path 

   1. MEP-A sends an in-band LI Message in response to a Management 
   system request to lock the transport path. The message will include 
   the source MEP-ID TLV.  

   2. Upon receiving the LI message, D uses the received label stack and 
   the source MEP-ID as per [3] to identify the transport path. If no 
   label binding exists or there is no associated transport path back to 
   the originator, or if the source MEP-ID does not match, the event is 
   logged.  Processing ceases. Otherwise the message is processed. 

    

5.6. UnLocking a transport path 

   1. In response to a Management system request to unlock the transport 
   path MEP-A stops sending LI Messages. 

   2. After 3.5 times the refresh timer, both sender MEP A and receive 
   MEP D unlock the transport path and put the transport path back in 
   service. 

    

6. Security Considerations 

   MPLS-TP is a subset of MPLS and so builds upon many of the aspects of   
   the security model of MPLS. MPLS networks make the assumption that it   
   is very hard to inject traffic into a network, and equally hard to   
   cause traffic to be directed outside the network. The control plane   
   protocols utilize hop-by-hop security, and assume a "chain-of-trust"   
   model such that end-to-end control plane security is not used. For   
   more information on the generic aspects of MPLS security, see [6].       

   This document describes a protocol carried in the G-ACh [4], and so 
   is dependent on the security of the G-ACh, itself. The G-ACh is a 
   generalization of the Associated Channel defined in [7]. Thus, this 
   document relies heavily on the security mechanisms provided for the 
   Associated Channel and described in those two documents.  

   A specific concern for the G-ACh is that is can be used to provide a   
   covert channel. This problem is wider than the scope of this   
   document and does not need to be addressed here, but it should be   
   noted that the channel provides end-to-end connectivity and SHOULD   
   NOT be policed by transit nodes. Thus, there is no simple way of   
   preventing any traffic being carried between in the G-ACh consenting   
   nodes.  


 
Boutros                 Expires March 15, 2012                 [Page 8] 
    
Internet-Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-tp-li-lb-05.txt       September 2011 
   A good discussion of the data plane security of an associated channel   
   may be found in [5]. That document also describes some mitigation 
   techniques. 

   It should be noted that the G-ACh is essentially connection-oriented   
   so injection or modification of control messages specified in this   
   document require the subversion of a transit node. Such subversion is   
   generally considered hard in MPLS networks, and impossible to protect   
   against at the protocol level. Management level techniques are more   
   appropriate. 

7. IANA Considerations 

7.1. Pseudowire Associated Channel Type 

   LI OAM requires a unique Associated Channel Type which is assigned by 
   IANA from the Pseudowire Associated Channel Types Registry.
