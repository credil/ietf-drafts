                         The PKCS#11 URI Scheme
                      draft-pechanec-pkcs11uri-00

Abstract

   This memo specifies a PKCS#11 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   Scheme for identifying PKCS#11 objects stored in PKCS#11 tokens, or
   for identifying PKCS#11 tokens themselves.  The URI is based on how
   PKCS#11 objects are identified in the PKCS #11 Cryptographic Token
   Interface Standard.

Internet-Draft           The PKCS#11 URI Scheme               March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The PKCS #11: Cryptographic Token Interface Standard [pkcs11_spec]
   specifies an API, called Cryptoki, for devices which hold
   cryptographic information and perform cryptographic functions.
   Cryptoki, pronounced crypto-key and short for cryptographic token
   interface, follows a simple object-based approach, addressing the
   goals of technology independence (any kind of device may be used?)
   and resource sharing (multiple applications may access multiple
   devices), presenting applications with a common, logical view of the
   device - a cryptographic token.

   It is desirable for applications or libraries that work with PKCS#11
   tokens to accept a common identifier that consumers could use to
   identify an existing PKCS#11 object in a PKCS#11 token, or an
   existing token itself.  The set of object types that can be stored in
   a PKCS#11 token includes a public key, a private key, a certificate,
   a secret key, and a data object.  These objects can be uniquely
   identifiable via the PKCS#11 URI scheme defined in this document.
   The set of attributes that identifies a PKCS#11 token can contain a
   token label, a manufacturer name, a serial number, and a token model.

   Note that the PKCS#11 URI is not intended to be used to create new
   PKCS#11 objects in tokens, or to create PKCS#11 tokens.  It is solely
   to be used to identify existing objects or existing tokens.


2.  PKCS#11 URI Scheme Definition

   In accordance with [RFC4395], this section provides the information
   required to register the PKCS#11 URI scheme.

2.1.  PKCS#11 URI Scheme Name

   pkcs11

2.2.  PKCS#11 URI Scheme Status

   Permanent.

2.3.  PKCS#11 URI Scheme Syntax

   The PKCS#11 URI scheme is a sequence of attribute value pairs.  Given
   that the PKCS#11 specification allows for any byte value to be used
   in the PKCS#11 attributes used, any byte sequence must also be
   allowed in the URI.  Semicolons may be escaped with a backslash.

Internet-Draft           The PKCS#11 URI Scheme               March 2010


   A PKCS#11 URL takes the form (for explanation of Augmented BNF, see
   [RFC5234]):

     pk11-URI              = pk11-scheme ":" pk11-identifier
     pk11-scheme           = "pkcs11"
     pk11-identifier       = *1(pk11-attr *(%x3B pk11-attr))
     pk11-attr             = pk11-token / pk11-manufacturer /
                             pk11-serial / pk11-model / pk11-object /
                             pk11-objecttype / pk11-passphrasedialog
     pk11-semicolon        = "\" %x3B
     pk11-label            = *(%x00-3A / %x3C-FF / pk11-semicolon)
     pk11-token            = "token" "=" pk11-label
     pk11-manufacturer     = "manufacturer" "=" pk11-label
     pk11-serial           = "serial" "=" pk11-label
     pk11-model            = "model" "=" pk11-label
     pk11-object           = "object" "=" pk11-label
     pk11-objecttype       = "objecttype" "=" ("public" / "private" /
                             "cert" / "secretkey" / "data")
     pk11-passphrasedialog = "passphrasedialog" "=" "builtin" / exec
     exec                  = "exec" ":" filename
     filename              = 1*(%x00-3A / %x3C-FF / pk11-semicolon)

   While the PKCS#11 specification limits the length of some fields, eg.
   the manufacturer label can be up to thirty-two characters long, the
   PKCS#11 URI does not impose such limitations.  It is up to the
   consumer of the PKCS#11 URI to perform any necessary sanity checks.

   The attribute "token" represents a token label, the attribute
   "manufacturer" represents a manufacturer ID, the attribute "serial"
   represents a token serial number, the attribute "model" represents a
   token model, the attribute "object" represents a PKCS#11 object
   label, the attribute "objecttype" represents the type of the object,
   and the attribute "passphrasedialog" specifies how the application or
   library should ask for the token PIN, if needed.  The "builtin" value
   suggests that the application or the library should use whatever
   means of reading the PIN it can provide, and the "exec:<filename>"
   value specifies an external application whose standard output should
   be used as the token PIN.


3.  Examples of PKCS#11 URI Schemes

   This section contains some examples of how PKCS#11 tokens or PKCS#11
   token objects can be identified using the PKCS#11 URI scheme.

   An empty PKCS#11 URI might be useful to PKCS#11 consumers:

     pkcs11:

Internet-Draft           The PKCS#11 URI Scheme               March 2010


   One of the simplest and most useful forms might be a PKCS#11 URI that
   specifies only an object label and its type.  The default token is
   used so the URI does not specify it.  Note that when specifying
   public objects, a token PIN might not be required.

     pkcs11:object=my-pubkey;objecttype=public

   Specifying a private key will usually need to use the
   "passphrasedialog" attribute:

     pkcs11:object=my-key;objecttype=private;passphrasedialog=builtin

   The following example identifies a certificate in the software token.
   Note that all attributes aside from "passphrasedialog" and
   "objecttype" may have an empty value.  In our case, "serial" is
   empty.  It's up to the consumer of the URI to perform necessary
   checks if that is not allowed.  Also note that in all three of the
   following examples, newlines and spaces were inserted for better
   readability.  Usage of newlines or spaces after semicolons is illegal
   in the PKCS#11 URI scheme defined above.

     pkcs11:token=Software PKCS#11 softtoken;
            manufacturer=Snake Oil, Inc.;
            serial=;
            model=1.0;
            object=my-certificate;
            objecttype=cert;
            passphrasedialog=exec:/bin/askpass.sh

   The token alone can be identified without specifying any PKCS#11
   objects.  A PIN may still be needed to list all objects, for example.

     pkcs11:token=Sun Software PKCS#11 softtoken;
            manufacturer=Sun Microsystems, Inc.;
            passphrasedialog=exec:/bin/askpass.sh

   The following example shows that the attribute value can contain a
   semicolon.  In this case, it must be escaped.

     pkcs11:token=The token\; created by Joe;
            object=my-certificate;
            objecttype=cert;
            passphrasedialog=exec:/bin/askpass.sh

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI scheme.  The registration template can
   be found in Section 2 of this document.


5.  Security Considerations

   There are many security considerations for URI schemes discussed in
   [RFC3986].

   Given that the PKCS#11 URI is also supposed to be used in command
   line arguments to running programs, and those arguments can be world
   readable on some systems, the URI intentionaly does not allow for
   specifying the PKCS#11 token PIN as a URI attribute.
