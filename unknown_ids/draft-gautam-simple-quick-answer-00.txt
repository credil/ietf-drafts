   IM (here after referred as QA - Quick Answer) can be created, stored
   and used when needed.  This document defines a new QA content type
   and XML namespace that conveys QA between two entities.  The QAs are
   delivered to the instant messaging sender in the same manner as the
   instant messages themselves.

Internet-Draft           Quick Answer for SIMPLE                Oct 2009


1.  Introduction

   In Instant Messaging conversation there may be some situation where
   receiver is unable to compose (type, speak) an IM in reply at that
   point of time.  However, due to the importance of the topic discussed
   and the sender himself, he also doesn't want the sender to feel
   avoided or left waiting for long time.

   To solve this issue this document proposes the concept of "Quick
   Answer" (QA), which are some readily available IM (text, audio,
   video) to the user, from which user can select as a reply to the
   sender.  As described in section 3 in more details, QAs are created
   by user in his/her ideal time using any IM capable client and stored
   on the server (QA Holder) as well as client.  When user logs-in the
   instant messaging system the QA stored on the client and the server
   are synchronized.

      The concept of QA may not be considered solely a client-level
      feature because of the fact that all the Instant Messaging system
      today allows users to log-in the Instant Messaging system using
      different client at different point of time.  In this scenario QA
      created by one client will not be available to another client.
      So, this functionality requires a client-server model.

   These QA are carried using XML, as instance of the XML schema defined
   in section 7 and labeled as application/im-QA+xml content type.  A QA
   is delivered to an instant messaging sender in the same manner as the
   messages themselves.  This document doesn't not emphasize on that
   part considering that it can be done using existing mechanism as
   specified in [2]

      Extensions to presence, such as PIDF [6]were also considered but
      have a number of disadvantages: Adds more overhead as an explicit
      and periodic subscription is required; Presence fits situation
      where IM sender (as watcher) gets information about IM recipient
      (as presentity), here the situation is reverse; Will not allow
      user to choose from different option (QA) available in real-time;
      I may want to send some QA to those who are not my 'watchers'
      (because they don't care about my presence information) but very
      important to me.  The mechanism proposed here would also ease the
      interoperability (translation) between heterogeneous instant
      messaging systems.

   The concept of QA can be considered related with the concept of
   "vacation" [3] used of emails.  However unlike QA, "vacation" does
   not allow user to choose from the list of available options (:handle
   in case of vacation).  In other words, no user intervention is
   required after vacation scripts are created.  Further unlike

Internet-Draft           Quick Answer for SIMPLE                Oct 2009


   "vacation" QAs are not generated automatically.


2.  Terminology and Conventions

   o  QA-Holder: QA holder is a SIP user agent identified by a SIP URI.
      QA Holder stores and manages QA.
   o  Quick Answer: Quick Answer is a readily available IM to the user.
      User can create Quick Answers which are made available to the user
      to choose from.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [5]


3.  Description

3.1.  Message Content

   This section describes the various elements which may be present in a
   QA message.  The normative XML schema is defined in section 5.  A QA
   message consists of a <qa> element with one mandatory element: <msg>,
   containing the actual QA message.  In addition, there are two
   optional element: <id>, used to carry the unique ID, assigned to a
   particular QA by QA Holder back to the UAC; <creationdate>, providing
   the date on which the QA is created.

3.2.  UAC Behavior

3.2.1.  Registration

   While registering, a QA complaint UAC SHALL include a qasupport
   option tag in the supported header of the REGISTER request [1] to let
   registrar know that it supports QA and would like registrar to
   initiate the synchronization process (through QA Holder)

3.2.2.  Composing QA

   Any instant messaging user agent can create a QA.  To do so it create
   a SIP MESSAGE [2] message with content-type as application/im-QA+xml
   and which will carry a QA as an instance of the XML schema define in
   section 5.  This MESSAGE message will be sent to QA Holder.  The
   message consists of a <msg> element containing the actual QA and a
   <creationdate> element providing the current date on which the QA is
   being created.  QA Composer MUST not include <id> element.

3.2.3.  Receving MESSAGE message

   On receiving a MESSAGE message with content type application/
   im-QA+xml, a UAC SHALL store the information (<id> and corresponding
   <msg>) received as a QA.

3.2.4.  Sending QA

   After synchronization is done, the UAC will have all the QA which are
   stored on the server.  User can select one or more QA from the list
   and UAC will send it to the instant message receiver as a normal IM.

3.3.  Post-Registration Behavior

   On registration register will inform (only if qasupport option tag is
   present in the supported header) QA Holder about the registering user
   agent.  To do this registrar will send a third-party REGISTER request
   to QA Holder as specified in [1]

3.4.  QA Holder Behavior

3.4.1.  Receiving third-party REGISTER from registrar

   After receiving third-party REGISTER request form registrar.  QA
   Holder SHALL initiates a session with UAC.  To do this QA Holder
   forms an INVITE request as specified in [1].  UAC receiving INVITE
   SHALL return 200 OK as the success response or the appropriate error
   response.  The session would then be established between QA Holder
   and UAC.  The QA synchronization process will them be performed on
   the session created.

3.4.2.  Receiving MESSAGE message

   On receiving a MESSAGGE message [2] with content type application/
   im-QA+xml, QA Holder SHALL generates a unique ID for the QA just
   received and store the QA with the ID generated.  Further, QA Holder
   SHALL send the ID generated back to UAC.  To do so it will generate a
   SIP MESSAGE message with content type application/im-QA+xml carrying
   an instance of XML schema defined in section 5.  The <id> element is
   used to carry the ID generated.  The <msg> element is used to carry
   the actual message.  The <creationdate> element MAY be present.
