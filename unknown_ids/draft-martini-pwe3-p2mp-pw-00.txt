Abstract

   This document specifies a mechanism to signal Point-to-Multipoint
   (P2MP) Pseudowires (PW) tree using LDP. Such a mechanism is suitable
   for any Layer 2 VPN service requiring P2MP connectivity over an IP or
   MPLS-enabled PSN. A P2MP PW established via the proposed mechanism is
   root initiated.

1. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



2. Introduction

   A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) emulates the essential
   attributes of a unidirectional P2MP Telecommunications service such
   as P2MP ATM over PSN. A major difference between a Point-to-Point
   (P2P) PW outlined in [RFC3985] and a P2MP PW is that the former is
   intended for bidirectional service whereas the latter is intended for
   both unidirectional, or bidirectional service. Requirements for P2MP
   PW are described in [P2MP-PW-REQ].

   P2MP PW can be constructed as either Single Segment (P2MP SS-PW) or
   Multi Segment (P2MP MS-PW) Pseudowires as mentioned in [P2MP-PW-REQ].
   P2MP MS-PW is outside the scope of this document.  A reference model

   for P2MP PW is depicted in Figure 1 below. A transport LSP associated
   with a P2MP SS-PW SHOULD be a P2MP MPLS LSP (i.e., P2MP TE tunnel
   established via RSVP-TE [RFC4875] or P2MP LSP established via mLDP
   [mLDP]) spanning from the ingress PE to the egress PE(s) of the P2MP
   SS-PW tree. For example, in Figure 1, PW1 can be associated with a
   P2MP TE tunnel or P2MP LSP setup using [mLDP] originating from PE1
   and terminating at PE2 and PE3.

   Mechanisms for establishing P2P SS-PW using LDP are described in
   [RFC4447].  In this document, we specify a method to signal P2MP PW
   using LDP. In particular, we define new TLVs, parameters, and status
   codes to facilitate LDP to signal and maintain P2MP PWs.

   Note that even though the traffic flow from an ingress PE to egress
   PEs is P2MP in nature, it may be desirable for any egress PE to send
   unidirectional P2P traffic destined only to the ingress PE. The
   proposed mechanism takes such an option into consideration.

   The P2MP PW requires an MPLS LSP to carry the PW traffic. the PW MPLS
   packet will be encapsulated according to the methods described in
   [RFC5332].

4. Signaling the P2MP PW

   In order to advertise labels as well as exchange PW related LDP
   messages, PEs must establish LDP sessions among themselves using the
   Extended Discovery Mechanisms. A PE discovers other PEs that are to
   be connected via P2MP PWs either via manual configuration or
   autodiscovery [BGP-AD].

   P2MP PW requires that there is an active P2MP PSN LSP set up between
   ingress and egress PEs. Note that the procedure to set up the P2MP
   PSN LSP is different depending on the protocol used: RSVP-TE or mLDP.
   In case of mLDP an egress PE can decide to join the P2MP LSP at any
   time, while in case of RSVP-TE the P2MP LSP is set up by the ingress
   PE, generally at the initial service provisioning time. It should be
   noted that local policy can override any decision to join, add or



Martini, et al.                                                 [Page 4]

Internet Draft     draft-martini-pwe3-p2mp-pw-00.txt        June 3, 2009


   prune existing or new PEs from the tree.

   In any case the PW setup can ignore these differences, and simply
   assume that the P2MP tunnel is available when needed.

   The P2MP PW is initiated by the root (source) Provider Edge router
   (R-PE), by simply sending an P2MP-PW LDP label mapping message to all
   the Leaf Provider Edge routers L-PEs. This label mapping message will
   contain the following:
        -i. P2MP PW FEC element.
       -ii. an Interface Parameters TLV,  as described in [RFC4447] sec
            5.3.2.1
      -iii. a PW Grouping TLV, as described in [RFC4447] sec 5.3.2.2
       -iv. a Transport LSP TLV.
        -v. a label TLV for the upstream-assigned label R-PE to L-PE
            direction.
       -vi. MAY contain a downstream-assigned label for the L-PE to R-PE
            direction.

            The LDP liberal label retention mode is used, and per
            [RFC5036] requirement the label request message MUST also be
            supported.

            The Upstream-assigned label is allocated according to the
            rules in [RFC5331].

            When an egress PE receives a PW Label Mapping Message, it
            MUST verify the associated P2MP transport LSP is in place.

            If the associated transport P2MP LSP is not in place, and
            the transport LSP TLV type is LDP P2MP LSP, an egress PE
            SHOULD attempt to join the P2MP transport associated with
            the P2MP PW.

            If the associated transport P2MP LSP is not in place, and
            the transport LSP TLV type is RSVP-TE P2MP LSP, an egress PE
            SHOULD await RSVP-TE P2MP LSP signaling from the ingress PE.


4.1. PW ingress to egress incompatibility issues

   If an ingress R-PE signals a PW with a pw type, CW mode, or interface
   parameters that a particular egress L-PE cannot accept, then the L-PE
   must simply not enable the PW, and notify the user. In this case a PW
   status message of 0x00000001 - Pseudowire Not Forwarding MUST also be
   sent to the R-PE.

   Note that this procedure does not apply if the L-PE had not been

   provisioned with this particular P2MP PW. In this case according to
   the LDP liberal label retention rules, no action is taken.


4.2. P2MP PW FEC Element

   [RFC4447] specifies two types of LDP FEC elements called "PWid FEC
   Element" and "Generalized PWid FEC Element" used to signal P2P PWs.
   We define a new type of FEC element called "P2MP PWid FEC Element"
   whose type is 0x82 (Pending IANA Allocation) and is encoded as
   follows:

   0                   1                   2                   3

     * PW Type:

       15-bit representation of PW type, and the assigned values are
       assigned by IANA.





Martini, et al.                                                 [Page 6]

     * C bit:

       A value of 1 or 0 indicates whether control word is present or
       absent for the P2MP PW.

     * PW Info Length:

       Sum of the lengths of AGI, SAII and Optional Parameters field in
       octets. If this value is 0, then it references all PWs using the
       specified grouping ID.  In this case, there are no other FEC
       element fields (AGI, SAII, etc.)  present, nor any interface
       parameters TLVs.

     * AGI:

       Attachment Group Identifier can be used to uniquely identify VPN
       or VPLS instance associated with the P2MP PW. This has the same
       format as that of the Generalized PWid FEC element [RFC4447].

     * SAII:

       Source Attachment Individual Identifier is used to identify the
       root of the P2MP PW. The root is represented using AII type 2
       format specified in [RFC5003].  Note that the SAII can be omitted
       by simply setting the length and type to zero.

     * Transport LSP TLV:

       A P2MP PW MUST be associated with a transport LSP. The Transport
       LSP TLV contains the information required to identify the
       transport LSP. Note that the Transport LSP TLV MUST immediately
       follow the FEC , but is not part of the FEC, and SHOULD NOT be
       used in other messages where the FEC is used.

     * Optional Parameters:

       The Optional Parameter field can contain some TLVs that are not
       part of the FEC, but are necessary for the operation of the PW.
       This document defines two such parameters: Interface Parameters
       TLV, and Group ID TLV.

   The Interface Parameters TLV and Group ID TLV specified in [RFC4447]
   can also be used in conjunction with P2MP PW FEC. In this case, the
   sender and receiver of these TLVs should follow the same rules and
   procedures specified in [RFC4447]. Note that since the LDP label
   mapping message is only sent by the R-PE to all the L-PEs it is not
   possible to negotiate any interface parameters.

Internet Draft     draft-martini-pwe3-p2mp-pw-00.txt        June 3, 2009


4.3. Group ID usage

   As Defined in [RFC4447] the Grouping TLV contains a group ID capable
   of indicating an arbitrary group membership of a P2MP-PW. This groupd
   ID can be used in LDP "wild card" status, and withdraw label
   messages, as described in [RFC4447].


4.4. Generic Label TLV

   For a given P2MP PW, a single upstream-assigned label is allocated by
   ingress PE, and is advertised to all egress PEs using the Generig
   Label TLV in the label mapping message containing the P2MP-PW FEC
   element. The ingress PE imposes the upstream-assigned label on the
   outbound packets sent over the P2MP-PW, and using this label, an
   egress PE identifies the inbound packets arriving over the P2MP PW.
   Even though the P2MP PW is unidirectional, it may be possible for an
   ingress PE to receive traffic from any egress PE using a
   unidirectional P2P PW in the reverse direction. For this purpose, the
   ingress PE can also allocate a unique downstream-assigned label for
   each egress PE from which it is intended to receive P2P traffic. In
   other words, Label Mapping Message for a P2MP PW from an ingress PE
   to an egress PE MUST carry a upstream-assigned label and MAY carry an
   OPTIONAL downstream-assigned label.

   As in the case of P2P PW signaling, P2MP PW labels are carried within
   Generic Label TLV contained in LDP Label Mapping Message. A Generic
   Label TLV is formatted and processed as per the rules and procedures
   specified in [RFC4447]. But, as mentioned above, a Label Mapping
   Message for a P2MP PW can have up to two Generic Label TLVs; one for
   upstream-assigned label (always) and another for downstream-assigned
   label (optional). In the case of two Generic Label TLVs, the first
   TLV (from the beginning of the message) carries upstream-assigned
   label and the next generic label TLV carries the downstream-assigned
   label as shown below:

   Note that other type of TLVs may appear between the above generic
   label TLVs, however any other generic label TLV MUST NOT appear
   between the upstream-assigned P2MP Label TLV, and downstream-assigned
   P2P Label TLV.


4.5. Transport LSP TLV

   A P2MP PW MUST be associated with a transport LSP which can be
   established using RSVP-TE or mLDP. Thus, a Label Mapping Message MUST
   contain the identity of the transport LSP. For this purpose, this
   specification introduces a new TLV called "Transport LSP TLV" which

     * Reserved Flags:

       Reserved bits Must be set to 0 when transmitting the message, and
       ignored on receiving the message.

     * PMSI Tunnel Type:

       The Transport LSP Type identifies the type of technology used to
       establish a transport LSP. The PMSI tunnel type is defined in
       [L3VPN-MCAST].

     * Tunnel Identifier:

       The Tunnel containing the Transport LSP is identified by the
       Tunnel Identifier which is defined in [L3VPN-MCAST].

   Transport LSP TLV MUST be present only in the Label Mapping Message.
   An ingress PE sends Label Mapping Message as soon as the transport
   LSP ID associated with the P2MP PW is known (e.g., via configuration)
   regardless of the operational state of the transport LSP. Similarly,
   an ingress PE does not withdraw the labels when the corresponding
   transport LSP goes down.  Furthermore, an egress PE retains the P2MP
   PW labels regardless of the operational status of the transport LSP.

   Note that a given transport LSP can be associated with more than one
   P2MP PW and all P2MP PWs will be sharing the same ingress PE and
   egress PEs.

   In the case of LDP P2MP LSP, when an egress PE receives the Label
   Mapping Message, it can initiate the process of joining the P2MP LSP
   tree associated with the P2MP PW.

   In the case of RSVP-TE P2MP LSP, only the ingress PE initiates the
   signaling of P2MP LSP.


5. P2MP PW status

   In order to support the proposed mechanism, a node MUST be capable of
   handling PW status. As such, PW status negotiation procedure
   described in [RFC4447] is not applicable to P2MP PW.

   Once an egress PE successfully process a Label Mapping Message for a
   P2MP PW, it MUST send appropriate PW status according to the
   procedure specified [RFC4447] to notify the PW status. If there is no
   PW status notification required, then no PW status notification is
   sent. (for example if the P2MP PW is established and operational with
   a status 0f 0x00000000 no pw status message is necessary).

   PW status message sent from any egress PE to ingress PE contains P2MP
   PW FEC to identify the PW. Finally, an ingress PE also sends PW
   status to egress PEs to reflect its view of a P2MP PW state.


6. Security Considerations

   The security measures described in [RFC4447] is adequate for the
   proposed mechanism.


7. IANA Considerations

7.1. FEC Type Name Space

   This document uses a new FEC element types, number 0x82 will be
   requested as an allocation from the registry "FEC Type Name Space"
   for the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP RFC5036).


7.2. LDP TLV TYPE

   This document uses a new LDP TLV types, IANA already maintains a
   registry of name "TLV TYPE NAME SPACE" defined by RFC5036. The
   following value is suggested for assignment:

      TLV type  Description
       0x0971   Transport LSP TLV
