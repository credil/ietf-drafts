Internet-Draft                   6PE MIB                    October 2010


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Provider Edge Routers (6PE) is a IPv6 transition technology,
   which could shift network to provide IPv6 access depending on
   existing Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) core network.
   Operators could deploy IPv6 network without modifying IPv4 enable
   MPLS cloud.  Therefore, 6PE is treated as a IPv6 transition solution
   on the early stage. 6PE will be adapted in more and more operational
   IP networks on account of IPv4 depletion and incremental advantages.

   RFC 4789[RFC4789] has elaborated 6PE technology.  When tunneling IPv6
   packets over the IPv4 MPLS backbone, rather than successively prepend
   an IPv4 header and then perform label imposition based on the IPv4
   header, the ingress 6PE Router MUST directly perform label imposition
   of the IPv6 header without prepending any IPv4 header.  In respect of
   managing IPv6 tunnel, RFC 4087[RFC4087] has specified managed objects
   used for managing tunnels of any type over IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
   But, this MIB module does not support tunnels over non-IP networks.
   RFC4382[RFC4382] has defined managed objects to configure and monitor
   MPLS layer 3 Virtual Private Networks.  Nevertheless, 6PE is neither
   Layer 3 IP tunnel nor MPLS layer 3 VPN.  This document is aimed at
   describing managed objects for 6PE.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410[RFC3410] .

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578[RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579[RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
   2580[RFC2580]


3.  Overview of MIB objects

   The following subsections describe the purpose of each of the objects
   contained in the 6PE-MPLS-STD-MIB.

3.1.  6PETunnelIfTable

   6PETunnelIfTable are defined in the MIBs defining the encapsulation.
   An entry in the 6PE Tunnel MIB will exist for every interface entry
   with this interface type.  An implementation of the 6PE Tunnel MIB
   may allow 6PETunnelIfTable to be created.  Creating a tunnel will
   also add an entry in the 6PETunnelIfTable, and deleting a tunnel will
   likewise delete the entry in the 6PETunnelIfTable.

3.2.  6PEMplsIfTable

   This table controls MPLS-specific parameters when 6PE is going to be
   carried over MPLS cloud.
