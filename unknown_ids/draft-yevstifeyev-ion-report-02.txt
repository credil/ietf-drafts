1.  Introduction

   This document is a report from the experiment with IETF Operational
   Notes (IONs), conducted by RFC 4693 [RFC4693] in accordance with RFC
   3933 [RFC3933].  It discusses the results of this experiment after
   first giving some background information on it in Section 2 and makes
   the appropriate conclusion.  This document updates RFC 4693 [RFC4693]
   and moves it to Historic status [RFC2026].

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Background 

   IETF Operational Notes (IONs) are a series of documents established
   by RFC 4693 [RFC4693] on an experimental basis [RFC3933] in 2006. 
   This series is (in accordance with RFC 4693 [RFC4693])

     intended for use as a repository for IETF operations documents,
     which should be more ephemeral than RFCs, but more referenceable
     than Internet-Drafts, and with more clear handling procedures than
     a random Web page.

   RFC 4693 [RFC4693] contains some regulations regarding this series,
   such as ION attributes, approval procedure, ION store considerations,
   etc.  It also proposes a set off initial IONs to be published and
   sets the sunset period of 1 year.  See RFC 4693 [RFC4693] itself for
   more background information on this topic.


3.  Experiment Notes and Results

   After establishing the IONs series per RFC 4693 [RFC4693], a number
   of IONs proposed by that document, as well as on some other topics,
   were published.  Particularly, the following IONs were issued:

   o ion-ad-sponsoring on "Guidance on Area Director Sponsoring of
     Documents" by Jari Arkko;

INTERNET DRAFT                IONs Report                 March 29, 2011


   o ion-agenda-and-minutes on "Formatting and Content of IETF Working
     Group Agendas and Minutes" by David Meyer and Olaf Kolkman;

   o ion-discuss-criteria on "DISCUSS Criteria in IESG Review" by the
     IESG members (at the date of approval);

   o ion-procdocs on "The IETF Process: an Informal Guide" by Brian
     Carpenter;

   o ion-rfc-2026-in-practice on "RFC 2026 in Practice" by Brian
     Carpenter;

   o ion-execd-tasks on "Tasks previously assigned to the IETF Executive
     Director" by Lucy Lynch and Brian Carpenter;

   o ion-meeting-network-requirements on "IETF Meeting Network
     Requirements" by Karen O'Donoghue, Jim Martin, Chris Elliott and
     Joel Jaeggli;

   o ion-subpoena on "Subpoenas in the IETF: Procedures" by Brian
     Carpenter;

   o ion-tsv-alt-cc on "Experimental Specification of New Congestion
     Control Algorithms" by Lars Eggert;

   o ion-ion-formats on "ION Format specification" by Brian Carpenter
     and Cullen Jennings;

   o ion-ion-store on "The ION Store" by Cullen Jennings and Brian
     Carpenter.

   However in 2008 it was identified that IONs experiment was closed.  

     The IESG has determined that IONs will not be used in the future. 
     It is clear that the IESG, IAB, and IAOC need the ability to
     publish documents that do not expire and are easily updated. 
     Information published as web pages, including IESG Statements, are
     sufficient for this purpose. 

   was mentioned in IESG note on this topic [IESG-IONS] by Russ Housley.

   All IONs were republished whether as IESG statements, Web Pages, or
   were discarded.  The full list is as follows:

   o ion-ad-sponsoring was republished as IESG statement "Guidance on
     Area Director Sponsoring of Documents" [SPONSOR];

   o ion-agenda-and-minutes was republished as Web Page "Formatting and

   o ion-discuss criteria was republished as IESG Statement "DISCUSS
     Criteria in IESG Review" [DISCUSS];

   o ion-procdocs was republished as Web Page "The IETF Process: an
     Informal Guide" [PROCDOCS];

   o ion-rfc2026-in-practice was republished as the Internet-Draft "RFC
     2026 in Practice" [2026PRACTICE] (that, however, at the time of
     publication of this document, has not resulted in RFC and is
     expired);

   o ion-execd-tasks was republished as Web Page "Tasks previously
     assigned to the IETF Executive Director" [EXECD];

   o ion-meeting-network-requirements was republished as Web Page "IETF
     Meeting Network Requirements" [MEETING];

   o ion-subpoena was republished as Web Page "Subpoenas in the IETF:
     Procedures" [SUBPOENAS];

   o ion-tsv-alt-cc was republished as IESG Statement "Experimental
     Specification of New Congestion Control Algorithms" [ALT-CC];

   o ion-ion-formats was discarded;

   o ion-ion-store was discarded.

   All IONs were located at
   <http://www.ietf.org/iesg/content/ions.html>, that is currently
   removed from IETF site.  However the Internet Wayback Machine project
   <http://www.archive.org/web/web.php> currently has some snapshots of
   this page, as well as all IONs, the most current before the
   experiment closure dated 16 April 2008.  You may freely access these
   snapshots at [IONS-SNAP].


4.  Conclusion

   Taking everything into account, it is now considered that IONs were
   an excessive facility, that does not give a great benefit to the
   IETF.  This document formally concludes the IONs experiment
   [RFC4693].  The IONs series SHALL now be terminated; no new IONs MUST
   be either approved or published.


5.  Security Considerations

INTERNET DRAFT                IONs Report                 March 29, 2011


   IONs did not include protocol specifications and therefore
   terminating this series is not believed to have any impact on the
   Internet security.


6.  IANA Considerations

   None.  RFC Editor SHALL delete this section upon publication.


7.  Acknowledgments

   Many thanks to Harald Alvestrand for his work on RFC 4693.  

   I would also like to thank all the authors and editors of IONs for
   their input to the experiment, particularly Jari Arkko, Brian
   Carpenter, Karen O'Donoghue, Lars Eggert, Chris Elliott, Joel
   Jaeggli, Cullen Jennings, Olaf Kolkman, Lucy Lynch, Jim Martin, David
