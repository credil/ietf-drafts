Internet-Draft    Node redundancy for VPLS Inter-domain        June 2011


1.  Introduction

   In many VPLS deployment based on [RFC 4762], inter-domain has been
   deployed without node redundancy, or only with node redundancy in one
   domain.  This document describes how to deploy inter-domain VPLS
   based on [RFC 4762] with node redundancy in both domain.  The draft
   reuses the existing protocols without introducing any new protocols.
   The domain in this document refers to AS, or other administrative
   domain.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.


3.  Motivation

   Inter-AS VPLS has now been wildly deployed between two providers.
   Usually, the physical link and ASBR between the two providers would
   carry many kinds of service, then it is important to provider link
   and node redundancy for such kind of inter-AS service to ensure high
   availability.

   Some current high availability deployments of inter-AS VPLS are
   provided by MC-LAG (Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation) and
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-iccp], but there is a pre-condition that the
   interconnected link between the two providers are Ethernet link.
   There are also many interconnection cases between two providers to
   use POS (Packet over Sonet/SDH) link on which MC-LAG cannot be
   enabled.  Moreover, it is also required for the VPLS between two
   providers to ensure bandwidth control, QoS, MAC address control and
   Broadcast/Multicast traffic control.  Then from the technical point
   of view, it is necessary to use PW to interconnect the two VPLS in
   its corresponding providers, and also to provide link/node redundancy
   to ensure high availability.


4.  Redundancy scenario with ICCP

   The following figure presents a typical inter-AS VPLS deployment
   topology.  PE3 and PE4 are the VPLS edge nodes in network of operator
   A, and PE5 and PE6 are the VPLS edge nodes in network of operator B.
   The PE3/PE4/PE5/PE6 may be ASBR of the AS, or VPLS PE within its own
   AS.

                                 Figure 1

   When inter-AS VPLS is deployed with node redundancy on both AS side,
   node redundancy protocol ICCP[I-D.ietf-pwe3-iccp]SHOULD be
   implemented on the VPLS edge nodes of the AS, e.g, ICCP should be
   running between PE3 and PE4, PE5 and PE6.

   There are several deployment scenarios for inter-domain VPLS:
   o  ICCP deployment option: ICCP is deployed on VPLS edge nodes in one
      domain, or in both domain;
   o  PW redundancy mode: independent or master/slave;

   From the operator's point of view, it is important to keep the
   technical balance and technical independence between the two
   operators.  One operator will not highly rely on the other operator's
   technical choice for inter-domain VPLS node redundancy.  Then it is
   highly recommended to be the deployment scenario as follows:
   o  ICCP deployment option: ICCP is deployed on VPLS edge nodes in
      both domain;
   o  PW redundancy mode: independent only;

   And this draft will only focus on the above deployment option, other
   options are out of the scope.


5.   Node redundancy for VPLS Inter-domain

   The PEs in the RG are required to run an inter-chassis communication
   protocol ([I-D.ietf-pwe3-iccp]) in order to select which
   pseudowire(s) should be in active/standby state for a given VPLS
   service instance.



Liu, et al.              Expires January 1, 2012                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    Node redundancy for VPLS Inter-domain        June 2011


   The procedures to select active/standby pseudowire(s):
   o  The PEs in the RG enable ICCP[I-D.ietf-pwe3-iccp].
   o  The PEs should establish a PW-RED application connection using the
      mechanism described in [I-D.ietf-pwe3-iccp], section 9.1.1.
   o  When the PW-RED application connection first comes up, Each PE
      MUST advertise it local PW configuration to other PEs that are
      members of the same RG.  As part of the configuration information,
      the PE should advertise a PW priority value that is used to
      determine the precedence of a given pseudowire.
   o  Pseudowire Status Synchronization.  A PE MAY re-advertise its PW-
      RED state in an unsolicited/solicited manner, the detailed
      mechanism is described in [I-D.ietf-pwe3-iccp], section 9.1.3.

   The PEs SHOULD then use PW redundancy bit
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy-bit] or basic PW status bit [RFC4447] to
   advertise the outcome of the arbitration to the peer PE(s).

   Before deploying inter-domain VPLS, the operator MUST negotiate to
   configure same PW priority at two end-points.  If different PW
   priority value is configured at the two PW end-points, e.g, PE3 and
   PE5 for PW1, and PE4 and PE6 for PW2 in figure 1, it is possible to
   select PE3 and PE6 as active for the two domain, then both PW1 and
   PW2 will be standby according to the independent mode in
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy-bit].


6.   MAC Withdraw procedure

   It MAY be desirable to remove or unlearn MAC addresses that have been
   dynamically learned for faster convergence.  This is accomplished by
   sending an LDP Address Withdraw Message.  It not only obey the rule
   of MAC withdraw mechanism as described in [RFC4762], but also obey
   the rule that the range of MAC Address Withdraw is confined in the
   same domain for security reason.  That means PE SHOULD not advertise
   MAC Address Withdraw message from one domain to the other.  If not,
   the MAC address withdraw message with empty list originated from one
   domain would lead to a VPLS in another domain to flush all MAC
   addresses which is not necessary, and bring potential network
   instability.  Correspondingly, VPLS PE that connects another domain
   SHOULD also reject any MAC Address Withdraw message received from
   that domain.

   In figure 1, we assume PE3 node failure.  The following case will
   describe MAC Address Withdraw of VPLS Inter-AS in detail.  Upon
   detecting that a remote PE3 that is member of the same RG, has gone
   downGBP[not]PE4 will send Address Withdraw Message to other PEs that
   in the same AS(e.g.,PE2,PE3,and PE1), but will not send to PE6.  The
   receiver PEs nodes flush the MAC addresses associated with

   corresponding VPLS instance.  Upon detecting remote-end PE3 failure,
   PE5 will send Address Withdraw Message to other PEs that in the same
   AS(e.g., PE6, PE7, and PE8).  The receiver PEs flush the MAC
   addresses associated with corresponding VPLS instance.  When PE6
   receives this Address Withdraw Message, it will not re-advertise it
   to PE4.


7.  Load Balancing

   It is recommended to configure different PW priority values for
   different VPLS instance, then the active PW of different VPLS will be
   running on different PEs, to provide load balancing between the two
   PE in one domain.

   In figure 2, it shows two VPLS inter-AS deployment.  VPLS_A will have

   PE4 and PE6, while VPLS_B will have the PW between PE4 and PE6 with
