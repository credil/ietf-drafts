           Adaptive VLAN Assignment for Data Center RBridges
                  draft-zhang-trill-vlan-assign-00.txt

Abstract

   When several RBridges are multi-accessed to a LAN link, each of them
   can act as the packet forwarder for the hosts attached to this link.
   One of the RBridges will be elected as the Designated RBridge (DRB)
   which is responsible to choose the Appointed Forwarder (AF) for each
   VLAN appearing on this LAN link. If the DRB casually assign a VLAN to
   an RBridge as the Appointed Forwarder without considering the number
   of the MAC addresses and traffic load of this VLAN, it may overload
   some of the RBridges while leave other RBridges lightly loaded. This
   unbalanced assignment issue reduces the scalability of a TRILL
   network and undermines its performance. Therefore, the TRILL DRB
   should choose Appointed Forwarders taking their load into
   consideration. The goal of this document is to design a new protocol
   to support the adaptive VLAN assignment (or Appointed Forwarder
   selection) based on the forwarders' reporting of their usage of MAC
   tables and available bandwidth.

1  Introduction

   The scales of Data Center Networks (DCNs) are expanding very fast
   these years. In DCNs, Ethernet switches and bridges are abundantly
   used for the interconnection of servers. The plug-and-play feature
   and the simple management and configuration of Ethernet are appealing
   to the DCN providers. A whole DCN can be a simple large layer 2
   Ethernet which is either built on a real network or on a
   virtualization platform.

   Cloud Computing is growing up from DCNs which can be seen as a
   virtualization platform that provides the reuse of the network
   resources of DCNs. A lot of cloud applications have been developed by
   DCN providers, such as Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Akamai's
   Application Delivery Network (ADN) and Microsoft's Azure. Cloud
   Computing clearly brings new challenges to the traditional Ethernet.
   The scales of the DCNs are becoming too large to be carried on the
   traditional Ethernet. The valuable MAC-tables of the bridges are
   running out of use for storing millions of MAC addresses. The
   broadcast of ARP messages consumes too much bandwidth and computing
   resources. The mobility of end stations brings dynamics to the
   network which can be a heavy burden if the management and
   configuration of the network involves too much manpower. The Spanning
   Tree Protocol used in the traditional Ethernet is outdated since
   there is only a single viable path on the tree for a node pair and
   this path is not always the best path (e.g., shortest path). 

   RBridges are designed to improve the shortcomings of the traditional
   Ethernet. To make use of the rich connections, RBridges introduce
   multi-pathing to the Ethernet to break the single-path constraint of
   STP. Multiple points of attachment is a basic feature supported by
   RBridges and common for Data Center Bridges. This feature not only
   increases the "east-west" capacity but also greatly enhances the
   reliability of DCNs [VL2] [SAN]. If several RBridges are attached to
   a bridged LAN link at the same time, the DRB is responsible for the
   assignment of a VLAN to one of the RBridges as the Appointed
   forwarder. However, the current VLAN assignment is done in a one-way
   manner. The DRB casually assign a VLAN to an RBridge attached to the
   local link without knowing its available MAC-table entries or
   bandwidth. The appointed forwarder does not feedback the utilization
   of its MAC-table or bandwidth either.

   This document aims to open a feedback passageway from a appointed
   forwarder to its DRB. Two types of sub-TLVs are defined, with which a
   forwarder can report its MAC entries and traffic bit rate
   respectively. By gathering these report messages, the VLAN assignment
   can be done in a way that the usage of the MAC tables and bandwidth
   of the attached RBridges are balanced.

INTERNET-DRAFT              VLAN Assignment                March 7, 2011


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  Data Center RBridge

   Data Center Networks grow rapidly recently. Ethernet is widely used
   in data centers because of its simple management and plug-and-play
   features. However, there are shortcomings of Ethernet. RBridges are
   designed to improve these shortcomings. In this section, we analyze
   the characteristics of the DCNs that impact the design of RBridges
   and reveal why the adaptive VLAN assignment is important for RBridges
   to be used in DCNs.

2.1  Scalability

   In the past years, a large DCN is typically composed of tens of
   thousands servers interconnected through switches and bridges. In the
   future cloud computing era, there can be as many as millions of
   servers in one DCN. The management of the numerous MAC addresses of
   the servers on the layer2 devices will become more and more complex.
   RBridges are aimed to replace the traditional bridges. The valuable
   CAM-tables on RBridges can easily be used up if they are not used
   reasonably [CAMtable]. For RBridges to be widely used in DCNs, the
   VLANs should be assigned to the RBridges in a manner that the MAC
   entries of the VLANs on the RBridges are balanced.

2.2  East-West Capacity Increase

   The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) in the traditional LAN blocks some
   ports of the bridges for the purpose of loop avoidance. However, the
   side-effects of STP are obvious. The link bandwidth attached to the
   blocked ports are not used which greatly wastes the capacity of the
   network. On the tree topology, the communication between the bridges
   of the left branch and right branch must transit the single root
   bridge, which forms a "hair-pin turn".

   With the rapid increase of the amount of servers in DCNs and their
   traffic demand, it is urgent to break the constraint of STP and
   enhance the "east-west" capacity of DCNs which are always richly
   connected. RBridges use the multi-path routing to set up the data
   plane of a TRILL network. Multiple RBridges may be attached to the
   same LAN link, which offers multiple access points to the LAN link.
   The hosts on this LAN link is therefore multi-homed to a TRILL
   network. All the attached RBridges can act as the packet forwarder
   for the VLANs carried on this LAN link. In the worst case, all the

INTERNET-DRAFT              VLAN Assignment                March 7, 2011


   VLANs are probably assigned to a single RBridge. Under this scenario,
   the ingress capacity on the other RBridges is wasted. It is necessary
   to balance the traffic load of the VLANs among these RBridges through
   the assignment of the VLANs. 

2.3  Virtualization

   Virtualization is important for increasing the utilization of network
   resources in DCNs. For example, the VPNs can be used to separate the
   traffic from different services therefore they can be carried on the
   same pool of resources. When the VPNs is carried over a TRILL
   network, RBridges can use a VLAN tag to identify each VPN. However,
   the use of VLANs multiplies the entries in the MAC table of the
   RBridges. Since a host can be a member of several VLANs at the same
   time, the RBridges have to store multiple copies of its MAC address
   in its precious MAC table. 

   Virtual Machines (VM) are widely used in DCNs. A physical host can
   support multiple VMs and each of the VMs has to be identified by one
   MAC address that is need to be stored in the MAC tables of the
   RBridges. This seriously increases the numbers of MAC entries in
   RBridges. Moreover, the number of VMs in a VLAN is not necessarily
   equal to the number of the physical hosts. VMs are spawned or
   destroyed based on the demand of the applications. They can also
   migrate from one location to another, which may be either an in-
   service or out-of-service move. VMs bring about the volatility of the
   size of VLANs. It is hard for a TRILL network to provide one static
   VLAN assignment based on the numbers of physical hosts of VLANs that
   is proper for all applications all the time. It is necessarily to do
   VLAN assignment adaptively.

3  MAC Entries Balancing 

   A CAM-table on a switch is expensive, which is a major constraint on
   the scalability of Ethernet [CAMtable]. When a RBridge is used to
   connect lots of hosts in large Data Center Networks, the entries of
   the CAM-table can easily be used up. The network should be tactically
   interconnected and the valuable MAC table entries should be used
   economically.

   RBridges support multiple points of attachment [TRILLbase]. When
   RBridges are used in a DCN to form a TRILL network, a LAN link MAY
   have multiple access points to this network. All the access RBridges
   are able to act as the packet forwarder of the VLANs carried on this
   LAN link. The DRB of this LAN link is responsible to pick out one of
   the RBridge attached to this LAN link as the appointed forwarder for
   each VLAN-x. In other words, the DRB assigns VLAN-x to one of the
   RBridge. For an assigned VLAN, its forwarder is not only responsible

   for forwarding the packets but also need to store the active MAC
   addresses of the hosts on this VLAN. 

   If the VLANs on the LAN link are not appointed properly, some of the
   RBridges's MAC tables are easily to be used up while the other
   RBridges are left idle. Take Figure 2.1 as an example, there are four
   VLANs carried on the LAN link: w, x, y and z. There are two hosts in
   both VLAN-w and VLAN-x and one host in both VLAN-y and VLAN-z. RB1
   and RB2 are both attached to this LAN link. RB1 is elected as the
   Designated RBridge who is responsible to choose the appointed
   forwarder for the above VLANs. The figure shows that VLAN-w,x are
   assigned to RB1 and VLAN-y,z are assigned to RB2. Obviously, this
   assignment is not balanced, since the MAC table of RB1 has four
   entries while the MAC table of RB2 only has two entries. If the DRB
   can reassign VLAN-w to RB1 and reassign VLAN-y to RB2, both RBridges
   will have three MAC entries, therefore a more balanced assignment is
   achieved.

   In order to assign the VLANs in a balanced way, the DRB need to know
   the usage of the MAC tables of its appointed forwarders and the sum
   of the MAC addresses in each VLAN. Since the RBridges only store the
   active MAC addresses and a virtual machine can move from one location
   to another, the MAC entries a VLAN occupy on an RBridge varies from
   time to time. The assignment of the VLANs cannot be done once for
   all. It is necessary for the DRB to do the assignment adaptively
   taking the usage of MAC tables of its appointed forwarders into
   consideration. Therefore, in Section 5.1, the MAC Entries Report sub-
   TLV is defined to deliver this kind of information from a forwarder
   to a DRB.

4  Traffic Load Balancing

   The traffic from the TRILL network to the local LAN link is called
   egress traffic while the traffic from the local LAN link to the TRILL
   network is called ingress traffic. A forwarder RBridge acts as both
   the ingress and egress point of a VLAN's traffic. The assignment of
   the appointed forwarder for each VLAN affects both the egress and
   ingress traffic load distribution.

4.1  Egress Traffic

   One RBridge MAY have multiple ports attached to the same local LAN
   link. These ports are called "port group" [TRILLbase]. When a DRB
   assigns a VLAN to an RBridge, its total available egress bandwidth of
   the port group needs to be taken into consideration. Using the TLV
   defined in Section 5.2, the load of the egress points are reported
   from the appointed forwarders to the DRB on the LAN link. The
   assignment SHOULD NOT cause congestion to an already busy egress
   point.

INTERNET-DRAFT              VLAN Assignment                March 7, 2011


   After VLAN-x has been assigned to an RBridge, the forwarding port
   assignment of one of the port group to VLAN-x as the forwarding port
   is entirely a local matter. Since a LAN link is a STP domain, more
   than one forwarding port for one VLAN will cause a loop. The
   forwarder MUST assign one and only one port for each VLAN. Load
   balancing can be realized through splitting the load among different
   VLANs as suggested in Section 4.4.4 of [TRILLbase]. 

4.2  Ingress Traffic

   After the known unicast packets enter the TRILL network from the
   ingress RBridge, they can be sent through the paths starting at this
   ingress point. Since the DRB knows the whole topology of the TRILL
   network, it can figure out these paths as well. Therefore, the DRB
   should take the available bandwidth of these paths into consideration
   when assigning the appointed forwarder of a VLAN. Any assignment that
   is possible to congest an already busy ingress point or a path should
   be avoided. 

   Traffic Matrices are usually taken as the input to the traffic
   engineering methods [TE]. The work in this section is actually
   changing the Traffic Matrices of the TRILL network. If traffic
   engineering is used in TRILL networks, the forwarder appointment
   mechanism should work together with the traffic engineering method to
   in order to achieve a more balanced global traffic distribution of
   the whole network. The DRB can also collect the probing messages used
   in the traffic engineering and then assign the VLAN according to the
   bandwidth utilization. However, the design of this kind of
   cooperative mechanism for balancing the ingress traffic is left as
   future work when traffic engineering solutions are begin to be used
   on TRILL networks [TBD].

5  Definition of sub-TLVs

   The Appointed Forwarders TLV has already been defined in [TRILLtlv].
   With this TLV, the DRB can appoint an RBridge on the local link to be
   the forwarder for each VLAN. However, there is no feedback from the
   appointed forwarder whether the assignment is reasonable. Two sub-
   TLVs are defined in this section to open the feedback passageway.
   They can be used by the appointed forwarder to report the number of
   MAC addresses and traffic load of VLANs in the reverse direction to
   the DRB. Through the collection of these report messages (these
   messages can be stored in the MIB of DRB [TRILLmib]), the DRB will
   have a vision of the MAC tables usage and bandwidth utilization of
   the RBridges on the LAN link. Based on this vision, the DRB can have
   a adaptive VLAN assignment.

   o  The Number of MAC Entries: The number of MAC Entries that the
      given VLAN occupies in the MAC table of the appointed forwarder.
      These MAC entries does not only contain the local MACs of the
      hosts on the local link but also includes the MAC addresses from
      the same VLAN on the remote link (i.e., the same virtual link).

   All the appointed forwarders will report this sub-TLV messages to the
   DRB of a LAN link. The information contained in these sub-TLV
   messages will help the DRB to make more balanced VLAN assignment
   among the RBridges on the LAN link. Because of host mobility, a
   former balanced VLAN assignment MAY become unbalanced. If a
   forwarder's MAC table is running out of use, the DRB can remove some
   VLANs from it and reassign them to another RBridge as the new
   forwarder. The number of "MAC Entries of VLANs" SHOULD be constrained
   by the inter-RBridge link MTU that defaults to 1470 bytes. If the MTU
   is not big enough to hold all the "MAC Entries of VLANs", the
   appointed forwarder MAY define its own policy to choose which VLANs
   it wants the DRB to remove [TBD].

5.2  Traffic Bit Rate Report sub-TLV 

   The appointed forwarder use Traffic Bit Rate Report sub-TLV to report
   the bandwidth utilization of its port group to the DRB. This sub-TLV
   has the following format:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Type=TrafficRep|                               (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Length       |                               (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  DRB Nickname                 |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Maximum Link Bandwidth       |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Available Link Bandwidth     |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Traffic Bit Rate of VLAN (1)               | (4 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              ......                         | (4 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Traffic Bit Rate of VLAN (n)               | (4 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where each Load of VLAN is of the form:

   o  Type: Traffic Bit Rate Report sub-TLV.

   o  Length:  6+4n bytes, where n is the number of VLANs that the
      appointed forwarder selects to report their traffic load that
      egress onto the port group. 

   o  DRB Nickname: The nickname of the Designated RBridge of the local
      link.

   o  Maximum Link Bandwidth: The maximum bandwidth of the port group
      attached to the local link.

   o  Available Link Bandwidth: The available bandwidth of the port
      group attached to the local link.

   o  RESV: 4 bits that MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

   o  VLAN ID: This field identifies one of the VLANs that assigned to
      the appointed forwarder.

   o  Traffic Bit Rate: The traffic bit rate of the given VLAN onto the
      local link through the port group of the appointed forwarder.

   The appointed forwarder send messages of this sub-TLV to its DRB. The
   DRB will know the bandwidth utilization of the port group of the
   appointed forwarder. If the port group of an RBridge attached to the
   local link is already heavily used, the DRB will refrain from
   assigning additional VLANs to this RBridge. If an appointed
   forwarder's port group attached to the local link is congested, its
   DRB MAY remove some of the VLANs reported in the Traffic Bit Rate
   Report TLV  message and reassign these VLANs to other RBridges
   attached to the same local link, which will decrease the traffic bit
   rate via that RBridge. The policy to decide which VLANs to reassign
   is [TBD].   

6  Security Considerations

   The delivery of the messages types in this document can be protected
   with the cryptographic mechanism proposed in [RFC5310]. In the
   future, TRILL MAY define its own secure control message transmission.
   The new message types introduced in this document can make use of
   that secure channel.

7  IANA Considerations

   Two code points of IS-IS sub-TLVs need to be assigned. This work
   should be done in conjunction with the work of [TRILLtlv].
