Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism of providing mapping service for
   LISP-like architecture.  The mapping service comprises of EID Router
   (ER) mechanism and supplementary DHT Mapping Overlay (MO), in which
   ER mechanism is for non-cached packets tunneling, while the DHT MO
   serves as a supplement that provides specific mappings to reduce
   tunneling cost.  The mechanism is flexibly deployable for ISPs since
   it costs little and is easy to progress.

1.  Introduction

   LISP [I-D.farinacci-lisp] is an architecture for scalable routing.
   It defines two address spaces: Routing Locators (RLOC) and Endpoint
   Identifiers (EID).  LISP uses EIDs as lookup keys for a new EID-to-
   RLOC mapping database, in which way several mapping services are
   built such as [I-D.fuller-lisp-alt] and [I-D.meyer-lisp-cons].  In
   these mapping service solutions, different kinds of overlays are
   designed and built as database for storing mapping information, as
   well as providing mapping lookup results for mapping queries.

   The problem they commonly share is that packets without any caches on
   current ITR have to be waiting for the reply of mapping lookup query,
   or simply be dropped by this ITR as long as no relevant cache exists
   on this ITR.

   One solution to this problem could be that, instead of sending lookup
   queries to the Mapping Overlay (MO), data packet itself is sent to
   the MO as a query and get forwarded in the MO to the final ETR linked
   to the site in which the destination EID resides.  But usually when a
   packet is going through the MO, long latency becomes a remarkable
   problem then.

   In this draft we describe a mechanism that aims:

   o  to eliminate all forwarding entries to distant customer ASes in P
      routers;

   o  to eliminate the forwarding entries, targeted to distant customer
      ASes not behind the border routers, in the border routers;

   o  to be deployed incrementally;

   o  to help reduce the number of tunnels.

2.  Definition of Terms

   Mapping:  EID-to-ELOC mapping.

   EID Router (ER):  a new introduced router which keeps entries to all
      EIDs.

   EID aggregated prefix:  an aggregated prefix which covers some EID
      blocks.

   EID+RLOC aggregated prefix:  an aggregated prefix which covers EID
      blocks and RLOCs.

   Mapping Node (MN):  an entity used for storing a mapping.  Each MN
      holds and can only hold one mapping, and each mapping is related
      to only one MN.

   Master Mapping Node (MMN):  a chosen Mapping Node used to be the
      representative among redundant MNs.  It is in charge of initiating
      mapping query and exchanging mappings.

   Mapping Server (MS):  a server specified to physically store
      mappings.  Each MS can hold more than one Mapping Nodes.

   Mapping Overlay (MO):  a DHT overlay based on Kademlia protocol,
      which is designed for storing the distributed mapping information.
      Only one MO exists among ISPs in the Internet.

3.  Overview

   To achieve the four aims in Section 1, the mechanism described in
   this draft mainly comprises of the following two parts:

   o  EID Router (ER) mechanism for non-cached packets tunneling, and

   o  DHT Mapping Overlay (MO) as a supplement, which provides specific
      mappings to reduce tunneling cost.

   The EID Router mechanism is designed for the first three aims, and
   the DHT MO is designed for the last aim.

   In EID Router mechanism, by manually or automatically setting the
   default route to an ER (each AS at least has one ER), all forwarding
   entries to distant customer ASes in P routers, and a part of
   forwarding entries (targeted to distant customer ASes not behind the
   border routers) in the border routers can be eliminated.

   The current running Border Gateway Protocol [RFC4271] is mainly
   utilized to propagate mappings through the current running BGP
   speaking system.  The most important reason to use the current
   running BGP speaking system is to make the deployment backward
   compatible, so that incremental deployment can be achieved.

   The DHT Mapping Overlay can help reduce the number of tunnels which
   result from deploying the ER mechanism.  It is optional for ISPs and
   only needs a little investment on it.

4.  When an ITR meets packets

   When an ITR receives a packet originated from a customer site, it
   checks whether a copy of mapping exists in its cache first.

   If the mapping exists, the ITR encapsulates the packet in a LISP
   header, putting the RLOC extracted from the mapping onto the outer
   destination address, meanwhile selecting one of the ITR's RLOC as the
   outer source address.

   Else if cache misses (i.e. no relevant copy of mapping exists in the
   ITR), two concurrent events occur:

   o  Data Plane Traffic: the packet simply follows a default route
      preset manually or automatically to an ER in current AS.  Since ER
      knows whole global mapping information, it can forward every
      packet to the right ETR by encapsulating the packet in LISP header
      with the ITR's RLOC in the outer source address and the ETR's RLOC
      in the outer destination address.

   o  Control Plane Traffic: the ITR sends a Mapping Query to its
      default Mapping Server (MS) in the AS.  And then a mapping LOOKUP
      process (details of mapping lookup process are shown in Section 7)
      is launched in the Mapping Overlay (MO) by the Master Mapping Node
      (MMN) of the ITR.  Finally a copy of queried mapping is returned
      to the ITR which initiated the Mapping Query, and is cached for a
      period of time.

5.  Utilization of BGP advertising

   The BGP is an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol.  The primary
   function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability
   information with other BGP systems.  This network reachability
   information includes information on the list of ASes that
   reachability information traverses.  This information is sufficient
   for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability, as
   well as inevitable for constructing the mappings from EIDs onto RLOCs
   automatically.  Moreover, especially for incremental deployment
   requirement, which means ASes deployed new mechanism must work along
   with those who not deployed, it is necessary to apply BGP to mapping
   service.

   The BGP in the mapping service has two functions: to obtain the
   mappings automatically, and to propagate mappings to ERs in other
   ASes.

5.1.  Automatic Mapping obtainment and storage

   When an customer AS advertise an BGP UPDATE message to homed (no
   matter single-homed or multi-homed) provider AS which is deployed the
   DHT mapping server described in Section 7, the provider AS would set
   or update the relevant mapping information according to the
   advertised route to the customer AS.  The announced prefix is treat
   as the EID in the mapping <EID, RLOC> and the address of the ETR
   which directly receives BGP announcement from the customer AS is
   chosen as the RLOC.

   This mapping could be stored both in MN (Mapping Node) and ER (EID
   Router) concurrently.  In the former case, one mapping refers to one
   MN and vice versa as described in Section 7.  However in the latter
   case, the mapping is not only stored in the ER in current provider
   AS, but also propagated to distant provider ASes by BGP
   advertisements and stored in ERs at those ASes.

5.2.  Mapping propagation by BGP

   BGP speakers work as what they act today, in addition that mapping
   information is affiliated in BGP UPDATE message.  Each BGP speaker on
   the route SHALL keep the originality of the mappings (i.e., the
   mappings stay untouched during propagation), except that it
   aggregates some prefixes into one.  New mapping SHOULD be formed when
   such aggregation occurs, in which case both EID and RLOC in mapping
   <EID, RLOC> are updated, that EID is set to the new aggregated EID
   block which covers more prefixes while RLOC is set to the address of
   either ER (if ER is deployed) or border router (if no ER is deployed)
   in current AS.

   Note that since aggregation is permitted during the mapping
   propagation, the number of mappings stored on the ERs would be far
   more less than the number of mappings stored in the MO.

6.  EID Router mechanism

6.1.  Address aggregation policy

   All addresses from edge customer ASes can be seen as the EIDs.  EID
   prefixes can be aggregated to EID aggregated prefix.  Moreover we
   allow EIDs to be aggregated with RLOCs to EID+RLOC aggregated prefix.
   For example, suppose two EID blocks 166.111.8/24 and 166.111.9/24
   belong to two customer ASes homed to a provider AS which has some
   RLOCs range from 166.111.10/24 to 166.111.11/24, the provider AS can
   aggregate either to an EID aggregated prefix 166.111.8/23 or to an
   EID+RLOC aggregated prefix 166.111.8/22.

6.2.  EID Router

   An EID Router is no particular than a legacy router, except that
   special configuration is applied.  It is configured to act as an eBGP
   speaker, and only loads the forwarding entries to all EIDs including
   EID aggregated prefixes.  Note that the EID+RLOC aggregated prefixes
   don't have to be loaded in EID Routers, since the RLOCs in the EID+
   RLOC aggregated prefixes are supposed be reachable (i.e., forwarding
   entries to these prefixes should be preserved in the P routers).

   So the ideal situation becomes:

   o  the EID Routers load the forwarding entries to all EIDs including
      EID aggregated prefixes,

   o  the P routers load the forwarding entries to all RLOCs and all
      EID+RLOC aggregated prefixes, and

   o  the border routers load the forwarding entries to all EIDs, RLOCs
      and EID+RLOC aggregated prefixes of the distant ASes behind the
      border routers.

   So due to deploying the EID Router mechanism, P routers and border
   routers can get their FIB (Forwarding Information Base) size reduced.

6.3.  When an ER meets packets

   When an ER receives a packet, it matches the destination address with
   entries in its forwarding table (that can be seen as the mapping
   table).  Since the ER holds whole mapping table (from its angle of
   view), this packet can be encapsulated in a LISP header and sent out.
   The tunnel end point may be one of the following four kinds of
   routers:

   o  the border router of the peering AS on the path to the
      destination, in which case aggregation occurs in this peering AS
      or this peering AS didn't pass the mapping information to the
      current AS.

   o  the border router of the non-peering AS on the path to the
      destination, in which case aggregation occurs in this non-peering
      AS.

   o  the EID Router of a distant AS (either peering or non-peering) on
      the path to the destination, in which case the downstream AS
      didn't pass the mapping information to this distant AS so that the
      ER in this distant AS created a new mapping (the ER's RLOC is set
      in the mapping).

   o  the destination ETR, in which case the originality of the mapping
      is maintained.

7.  Supplementary DHT Mapping Overlay (MO)

   The DHT Mapping Overlay (MO) is based on Kademlia, a highly efficient
   protocol of Distributed Hash Table (DHT) overlay for Peer-to-Peer
   network, which applies XOR as metric to measure distance.  Here in
   the MO, it is adapted to meet several requirements below:

   o  MO should be scalable;

   o  MO should have a good ability of redundancy;

   o  MO should be self-adaptive for mapping adding or failure;

   o  MO should be flexible for balancing performance and overhead;

   o  MO should support multi-homing scenario.

   The benefit of deploying the MO is that, it provides specific
   mappings since it doesn't aggregate prefixes (i.e., mappings stored
   in MO are finest-granulated that each mapping refers to one relation
   between a customer AS and one of its provider site).  Due to the
   large number of such fines-granulated mappings, the MO should be
   scalable and capable for redundancy.  So DHT is chosen as the means
   of distributing the mappings.

7.1.  Mapping Node (MN) and Mapping Server (MS)

   Each mapping is stored on one Mapping Node (MN) in the Mapping
   Overlay (MO), and each Mapping Server (MS) can accommodate more than
   one MNs.  For example, an ISP is accessed by 5 customer ASes labeled
   as a, b, c, d, e, whose corresponding EIDs are v, w, x, y, z
   respectively.  These five EID prefixes of customer ASes are one-to-
   one mapped, forming five MNs physically existed on one or multiple
   MSes administrated by the ISP.

7.2.  MNID Assignment and K-bucket Table

   In the MO, each MN is assigned a 160 bit ID.  The DHT MO utilizes the
   highest numerical IP address reserved in customer ASes as a MNID.
   For example, assume a customer AS with a prefix 162.137.2/24 is
   mapped to the RLOC 134.121.3.56.  The lower 32 bits of the MNID of
   the corresponding Master Mapping Node (MMN) is 0xA28902FE (i.e.,
   162.137.2.254), and the rest 128 bits are all 0.  The mapping will be
   stored on this MMN and several (at least one) other MNs whose MNIDs
   are closest to the MNID 0xA28902FE.

   Each MN manages a K-bucket table of its own that keeps addresses
   (RLOCs) and some other information (e.g.  MNID) of other nodes.  The

Internet-Draft                    ER+MO                        July 2009


   table of a node N consists of 160 rows in which the i-th row (0 <= i
   < 160) preserves information (i.e.  RLOCs and IDs) of some nodes
   which are at a distance range 2^I ~ 2^(i+1) from node N. If i becomes
   quite large, the number of nodes that the i-th row preserves is
   limited to K at most.

7.3.  LOOKUP Process

   LOOKUP process needs to call FIND_MAP with MNID of destination MN as
   parameter.  Here describes the FIND_MAP procedure:

   1.  MN A calculate the distance D from A to B (D = A XOR B);

   2.  Fetch m MNs from the right row of K-bucket table of MN A and then
       query them (call FIND_MAP for every one of these m MNs);

   3.  MN A set a timer waiting reply for each MN that a called
       FIND_MAP.  If it expires, then delete information of
       corresponding MN in K-bucket table.

   4.  Each MN who received FIND_MAP call will check if it is one of the
       closest MNs destined to B. If so then return mapping to MN A;
       else like in step 1 and 2, calculates distance D and fetches m
       closer MNs, then return them to MN A.

   5.  MN A continues to send FIND_MAP calls to those returned MNs until
       mapping returned or find K closest MNs (which means no such
       mapping existed).

7.4.  Security Consideration of Mapping Storage

   In native Kademlia, any MN can initiate a STORE call to put the <key,
   value> pair on other K closest nodes.  But for the reason that it
   could probably cause security problem, for instance a malicious MN
   store a wrong mapping in other MNs, a mapping can only initially
   stored on one or more MNs (a MMN is chosen) which are under
   supervision of the ISP who in fact controls this mapping.  And only
   the MMN is authorized to call STORE.  After running for hours, MNs in
   some other autonomous systems could keep cache of the mapping.

7.5.  Self-adaptive Capability

   Comparing to other non-DHT mapping system, the DHT MO is more
   adaptive for MN failure and dynamic MN joining.

   Assume an ISP deploys multiple MSes for the address block of a
   customer AS in one or multiple provider ASes it administrates.  When
   some of MNs go down, as long as at least one MN is healthy, mappings



Chen, et al.             Expires January 7, 2010               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                    ER+MO                        July 2009


   service can be normally provided without manually configuration.
   Even if they're all out of health temporarily, mapping information
   cached on other MNs could also be available in a period of time
   (cache updating period).

   When a new customer site accesses to some ISP, a new mapping is
   required to be added in the MO.  It needs to add a new MN u into the
   MO and put this mapping in MN u.  At first, an existing MN w in MO
   should be known and w is put into u's K-bucket table.  Then do a
   LOOKUP process with u's MNID as parameter.  Finally information in
   K-bucket table of MN u can be built up and meanwhile other MNs update
   their K-bucket table as well during the LOOUP process.

7.6.  Dynamic Adjustment of K value and m value

   After one LOOKUP, if the time of this LOOKUP is greater than
   threshold t (manually configured by ISP), which implies that this
   LOOKUP spent too long time, then increase K by 1.  At the same time,
   if 2m < K then m = 2m, otherwise increase m by 1.  Consequently, more
   queries will be sent to MNs during this LOOKUP process.  However if
   the time of this LOOKUP is no greater than t, K value and m value
   stay not changed.

   When congestion occurs in some AS, K value and m value both decrease
   by 1 to suppress number of updates that used to keep in touch with
   other MNs.

7.7.  Mapping Storing and Exchanging in Multi-homing Scenario

   Suppose a scenario that a customer site accesses to more than one
   ISP, which is called multi-homing.  When a new MMN x puts the new
   mapping in the mapping system, another MMN y with the same MNID will
   be probed in the MO.  Different to native Kademlia protocol, no "ID
   Collision Error" occurs.  Instead x tells y this new mapping and
   meanwhile obtains mapping information existed already.  Finally x and
   y both know all mapping information about how to destine for the
   customer AS.  Of course x and y will probe each other to ensure
   availability every period of time.

8.  Incremental Deployment

   This mechanism is practical for incremental deployment, since no big
   changes introduced on existing routers.  Instead of deploying an
   imperative third-party infrastructure over current Internet, an ISP
   only puts one or more MSes in its domain and configures it to join
   the MO if it wants to benefit from deploying the DHT MO.

   An ISP could start from deploying an ER in its domain, through which
   way the number of entries in other routers in this domain could be
   reduced however the length of the intra-domain route grows.  It's up
   to ISPs to decide whether to tolerate such length-stretch to obtain
   decrease of FIB (Forwarding Information Base) size.

   As time goes by, suppose more and more ISPs have deployed ERs.  Some
   of them may then deploy the DHT MO to benefit from specific mappings
   (that can decrease number of tunnels needed in each data
   transmission) by simply putting MSes in their ASes and let them join
   the MO automatically as described in Section 7.

   Note that unlike other mechanisms, no new particular devices are
   required to support backward-compatibility.

10.  Security Considerations

   The ERs can apply any existing security mechanisms for BGP to enhance
   the security.  And for DHT MO, existing authentication methods for
   DHT (especially for Kademlia) can be adapted to enhance its security.
   Other new security enhancements are expected to design to support the
   mechanism in this draft in future.
