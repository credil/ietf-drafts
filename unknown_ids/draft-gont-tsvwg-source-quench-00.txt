Internet-Draft      Deprecation of ICMP Source Quench     September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The ICMP specification [RFC0792] defines the ICMPv4 Source Quench
   message (type 4, code 0), which is meant as a mechanism for
   congestion control.  ICMP Source Quench is known to be an ineffective
   (and unfair) antidote for congestion, and generation of ICMP Source
   Quench messages by routers has been deprecated by [RFC1812] for a
   long time.  However, reaction to ICMP Source Quench messages in
   transport protocols has never been formally deprecated.

   This document formally deprecates reaction to ICMP Source Quench
   messages by transport protocols such as TCP.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  ICMP Source Quench messages

   The ICMP specification [RFC0792] defines the ICMP Source Quench
   message (type 4, code 0), which is meant to provide a mechanism for
   congestion control.  The Host Requirements RFC [RFC1122] states in
   Section 4.2.3.9 that hosts MUST react to ICMP Source Quench messages
   by slowing transmission on the connection, and further adds that the
   RECOMMENDED procedure is to put the corresponding connection in the
   slow-start phase of TCP's congestion control algorithm [RFC5681].

   [RFC1812] notes that research suggests that ICMP Source Quench is an
   ineffective (and unfair) antidote for congestion, and formally
   deprecates the generation of ICMP Source Quench messages by routers,
   stating that routers SHOULD NOT send ICMP Source Quench messages in
   response to congestion.

   [RFC5927] discusses the use of ICMP Source Quench messages for
   performing "blind throughput-reduction" attacks, and notes that most
   TCP implementations silently ignore ICMP Source Quench messages.

   We note that TCP implements its own congestion control mechanisms
   [RFC5681] [RFC3168], that do not depend on ICMP Source Quench
   messages.


3.  Updating RFC 792 and RFC 1122

   If an ICMP Source Quench message is received by a transport-protocol
   instance (e.g., a TCP connection), it SHOULD be silently ignored.

4.  Security Considerations

   ICMP Source Quench messages can be leveraged for performing blind
   throughput-reduction attacks against TCP and similar protocols.  This
   attack vector, along with possible countermeasures, have been
   discussed in great detail in [RFC5927] and [CPNI-TCP].

   Silently ignoring ICMP Source Quench messages, as specified in this
   document, eliminates the aforementioned attack vector.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.  The RFC-Editor can remove
   this section before publication of this document as an RFC.


6.  Acknowledgements

   This document has benefited from discussions within the TCPM Working
   Group while working on [RFC5927].

Appendix A.  Survey of support of ICMP Source Quench in some popular
             TCP/IP implementations

   A large number of implementations completely ignore ICMP Source
   Quench messages meant for TCP connections.  This behavior has been
   implemented in, at least, Linux [Linux] since 2004, and in FreeBSD
   [FreeBSD], NetBSD [NetBSD], and OpenBSD [OpenBSD] since 2005.
