1  Introduction

   File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to
   copy a file from one host to another over a TCP-based network.  It
   has had a very long history; the protocol is rooted in the early
   1970s, the times of ARPANET, with the first specification being RFC
   114 [RFC0114]; however, the most current FTP specification is RFC 959
   [RFC0959].  (Also visit Section 4 pf RFC 1123 [RFC1123] for
   "narrative" description of FTP.)

   Historically, there has been a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   scheme for referencing resources accessible via FTP - 'ftp' URI
   scheme.  The first mention of it appears in RFC 1630 [RFC1630] - pre-
   Standard Track RFC on URIs.  Later, RFC 1738 [RFC1738], Section 3.2
   specified this scheme on IETF Standards Track.  Subsequently, RFC
   1738 was formally obsoleted by RFC 4248 [RFC4248] and RFC 4266
   [RFC4266]; in fact RFC 2396 [RFC2396] and its successor - RFC 3986
   [RFC3986] - replaced and deprecated it (formally they both updated
   RFC 1738).  Currently, almost all of URI schemes specified in RFC
   1738 have been given a separate specification; one of the rare
   exceptions is the 'ftp' URI scheme.  This document removes this
   uncertainty; it gives the 'ftp' URI scheme an official, Standard

   Track documentation. It updates RFC 959 [RFC0959] and RFC 1738
   [RFC1738].

   Please note that the 'ftp' and 'file' URI schemes are not the same,
   even though they both might refer to the resource on the local host.

   Generic URI syntax is described in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]; registration
   procedures for new URI schemes - in RFC 4395 [RFC4395].

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  URI Scheme Specification

2.1. URI Scheme Syntax

   The 'ftp' URI takes the form of <ftp-uri> rule below, specified using
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234]:

   ftp-uri       = "ftp:" ftp-hier-part
   ftp-hier-part = "//" [user-pass "@"] host-port [ftp-path]
   user-pass     = user [":" pass]
   user          = *usp-char
   pass          = *usp-char
   usp-char      = *(unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims)
   host-port     = host [":" port]
   ftp-path      = path-abempty [typecode-part]
   typecode-part = ";typecode=" typecode
   typecode      = "a" / "i" / "d"

   where the <host>, <port>, <unreserved>, <pct-encoded>, <sub-delims>
   and <path-abempty> rules are defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986], Appendix
   A.  The semantics of each part are defined below, in Section 2.2.

2.2. URI Scheme Semantics

   The 'ftp' URI specifies either a FTP server for establishing a
   connection (when <ftp-path> is omitted) or a resource on such FTP
   server (when <ftp-path> is present).

   The application resolving the 'ftp' URI SHALL follow the following
   algorithm:

   o Request the password, if not supplied in the URI (per Section

INTERNET DRAFT            The 'ftp' URI Scheme              May 20, 2011


   2.1.1);

   o Establish the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [RFC0793]
   connection to the resource identified by the <host> on the port
   identified by the <port> (or 21, if not supplied there); 

   o Authenticate itself to the server, using either the credentials of
   the URI, those requested from the user or anonymous FTP [RFC1635];

   o Perform a series of commands according to <ftp-path> part (see
   Section 2.2.3).

   'ftp' URIs may also be used for other operations; for instance, it is
   possible to update or remove a file on a remote file server.  The
   mechanism for doing so is not specified in this document.

     Note:  The 'ftp' URI scheme supports FTP over TCP only; such
     derivations as FTP over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [RFC0768] are
     not supported by it.

   More detailed description of each URI's parts' semantics is below.

2.2.1. The <user-pass> Part

   The <user> part of the 'ftp' URI specifies the user name that will be
   used for FTP authentication; <pass> part - the password.  The user
   name and password SHALL be transmitted using the "USER" and "PASS"
   FTP commands, respectively, defined in RFC 959 [RFC0959].  The user
   name and password are delimited by the colon (":") character (ASCII
   [ASCII] character 0x3A).

   The <user-pass> part is OPTIONAL in 'ftp' URIs.  Thus, if the whole
   <user-pass> part is omitted, the following "anonymous FTP" convention
   [RFC1635] SHALL be used:

   (1) the user name "anonymous"; and 

   (2) the password that is an e-mail address [RFC5322] of the client is
       supplied.

   The <pass> part in the <user-path> is OPTIONAL as well.  Therefore,
   if there is a user name but no password supplied in the 'ftp' URI, it
   SHALL be requested from the user.

   The <user> and <pass> parts of the URI is composed of the characters
   of <usp-char> ABNF production; any other characters SHALL be percent-
   encoded if occur in these parts.  The <usp-chair> rule includes
   characters allowed in RFC 3986 <userinfo> production, excluding the

   colon (":") character, whose use is explicitly specified above.

   RFC 3986 deprecated the use of "user:pass" pair in the <userinfo>
   part of URIs.  However, for some historical reasons, the benefits of
   the use of such construction for denoting the user information are
   valuable enough to overlook this issue.  

2.2.2. The <host-port> Part

   The <host-port> part specifies the FTP server the resource identified
   by a particular 'ftp' URI is located on.

   If the ":<port>" is omitted, the port SHALL default to 21, as
   registered in [IANA-PORTREG].

2.2.3. The <ftp-path> Part

   The <ftp-path> part, which is OPTIONAL, has the following non-
   normative syntax:

   <cwd1>/<cwd2>/.../<cwdN>/<name>;type=<typecode>

   where ";type=<typecode>" is OPTIONAL as well.  This part SHALL be
   interpreted as follows (in this algorithm productions from the
   aforementioned non-normative syntax are enclosed in angle brackets):

    (1) each of <cwd> parts are consistently supplied as arguments to
        the CWD (change working directory) FTP command after
        establishing the FTP connection to the server identified by the
        <host-port> part of the URI; 

   (2a) if the <typecode> is equal to "d", the NLST (name list) FTP
        command (see Section 4.1.3 of RFC 959 [RFC0959]) with <name> as
        the argument is sent out; 

   (2b) otherwise, the TYPE FTP command (see Section 3.1.1 of RFC 959
        [RFC0959]) with the <typecode> as an argument is performed; and 

    (3) access the file identified by the <name> in an appropriate way.

2.2.3.1. A Note on <typecode-part> Part

   The <typecode-part> part has rarely been seen in the wide
   development.  It is not often used in 'ftp' URIs and is included in
   this specification for historical reasons.  Thus, if the <typecode-
   part> is omitted, the client program interpreting the URI SHOULD
   guess the appropriate mode to use.

2.3. Encoding Considerations

   The 'ftp' URIs may contain characters form the Universal Character
   Set (UCS) [UCS], encoded using UTF-8 character encoding [RFC3629], as
   suggested by RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  Those octets that do not correspond
   to the characters in the unreserved set of RFC 3986 SHALL be percent-
   encoded.  In fact, there are no other encoding considerations for
   'ftp' URIs not discussed in Section 2 of RFC 3986.

   Please visit RFC 3536 [RFC3536] for definitions of the terms related
   to encoding and internalization.


3.  Security Considerations

   Generic security considerations for URIs are discussed in Section 7
   of RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

   Security considerations for FTP are addressed in RFC 2577 [RFC2577]. 
   RFC 2228 [RFC2228] and RFC 4217 [RFC4217] provided a bunch of ways
   for securing FTP.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to update the registration of the 'ftp' URI scheme
   using the following template, per RFC 4395 [RFC4395]:

   o URI scheme name: ftp

   o Status: Permanent

   o URI scheme syntax: see Section 2.1 of RFC xxxx

   o URI scheme semantics: see Section 2.2 of RFC xxxx

   o URI scheme encoding considerations: see Section 2.3 of RFC xxxx

   o Protocols that use the scheme: File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
     [RFC0959]

   o Security considerations: see Section 3 of RFC xxxx

   o Contact: IESG <iesg@ietf.org>

   o Author/Change controller: IETF <ietf@ietf.org>

   o References: see Section 5 of RFC xxxx
