Abstract

   This memo discusses applicability for energy management features to
   various types of devices and buildings.  It describes the variety of
   applications that can use the EMAN energy framework and associated
   MIB modules.  P otential examples are building networks, home energy
   gateway, etc.  Finally, the document will also discuss relationships
   of the framework to other architectures and frameworks (such as
   smartgrid).  The applicability statement will explain the
   relationship between the work in this WG and the other existing
   standards such as those from the IEC, ANSI, DMTF, and others.

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The EMAN framework describes functionality for reporting of energy
   information in an Internet Protocol network, as a critical first step
   towards energy management more generally, including control.  Other
   Internet Drafts describe the requirements, framework, and
   implementation of this system.  This document reviews how it is
   expected to be used, and how it relates to other activities regarding
   energy and information technology.

   This document is intended to be useful to a wide set of audiences,
   including those with energy as a primary interest (who do not
   necessarily have any background in networking) as well as the more
   usual network-centric audience in the IETF.

   The most basic example of energy management is a single device
   reporting only basic information about its own energy status; we call
   these "simple devices".  The information is reported directly to a
   Network Management System (NMS).  The framework also provides
   additional features for collecting information from devices
   intermediate between the NMS and end-use devices.  These intermediate
   devices (which we call "complex devices") may have capabilities for
   monitoring or control, may serve to collect information from many
   devices for more efficient data transfer, may process the data (e.g.
   by summing across many devices), or any combination of these.  The
   same protocol is used whether the NMS is communicating with an
   intermediate or end use device.  The same protocol may be used
   between an intermediate and end use device.

   Some aspects of doing energy management include discovering devices,
   understanding power distribution, and the network management system
   (NMS).

   This protocol does not define anything about the network management
   system, but only identifies it as the recipient of information.  The
   NMS will commonly have an entire single building as its scope, though
   in some cases will cover only a part of a building, or multiple
   buildings.  Usually the NMS will be scoped to match the reach of the
   local area network it is part of.

   All devices are in scope, whether they are traditional IT products
   like computers or network equipment, or other energy-using devices
   that are only now beginning to get IP connections, such as
   appliances, lighting, and climate control systems.  (Devices that are
   only ever powered by batteries, such as sensor nodes, could use this
   protocol, but are not a target).

2.  Terminology

   This section reviews select terms used in this draft.

2.1.  Building Network

   Traditional IT local networks are made up of entities that provide
   information services.  Future Building Networks will not be separate
   from the IT network, but will incorporate many devices whose primary
   function is not information, such as those that provide light,
   regulate temperature or ventilation, and appliances.  A building
   network is IP-based and enables full inter-operation of IT and non-IT
   devices.

   Traditional building control systems were developed before IP
   networking, often have limited scope in the services they address,
   and are often based on proprietary technologies.

2.2.  Network Management System

   TBD.


3.  Use Contexts

   This section reviews the applications that the framework is intended
   to be suitable for.  These vary according to the nature of devices
   involved, and the institutional environment.  The other documents
   specify nothing about the network management system (NMS)

3.1.  Management context

   This section reviews the applications that the framework is intended
   to be suitable for.  These vary according to the nature of devices
   involved, and the institutional environment.  The other documents
   specify nothing about the network management system (NMS)

3.1.1.  Highly managed

   Some network environments are closely monitored for what devices are
   introduced to it, their characteristics and capabilities, and the
   functions they provide; many data centers are managed this way.
   These are more likely to use advanced features of energy management
   technology, including accounting for multiple power supplies for
   products, use of power control, and more attention to power
   distribution.  They also are more likely to be concerned with power
   quality characteristics.




Nordman                 Expires September 8, 2011               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


   The NMS in these contexts may be integrated with systems for
   functional control of devices.  For a data center, the primary focus
   is the IT equipment it contains, though the devices that provide
   power and those that do space conditioning are also likely to be
   monitored through the NMS.  Monitoring data may be obtained
   frequently to closely track a dynamic usage environment.

3.1.2.  Loosely managed

   Other environments are not actively managed at all.  Devices enter or
   leave the network on their own terms, and are fundamentally
   autonomous.  Power control is not utilized at all, and the goal of
   the energy management facility is to simply understand what is going
   on, not to carefully mange it.  Most residential buildings are an
   example of this type of network, where there is no personnel or
   procedures for active network management.  Power quality and capacity
   are essentially never a concern.

   The NMS in a loosely managed environment should be as automatic as
   possible, so that the user can get useful information with little or
   no effort.  No functional control is involved.  Such environments
   will have a mixture of devices that can report power information as
   well as many that cannot.  The NMS is principally tracking long-term
   trends and so information gathering is usually not frequent.

3.1.3.  Hybrids

   Most network environments have elements of these two extremes, both
   sets of devices of each sort, as well as devices that are managed in
   an intermediate form.  Commercial buildings are commonly of this
   form, with some devices being highly managed, and others only loosely
   tracked.

   The NMS for a hybrid must be able to accomodate a diverse set of
   devices and is likely to track some closely, and others much less so.

3.2.  Building types

   The EMAN facility is designed to be used in any building type (though
   the specific needs of industrial buildings have not yet been
   considered).  Core building types are residential, commercial, and
   vehicle.  In the United States, buildings account for just over 70%
   of electricity use, with this split almost evenly between residential
   and commercial.

   The cases of multi-tenant buildings (residential and commercial)
   noted below raise the possibility of a device reporting to more than
   one NMS.

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


3.2.1.  Residential

   Residential buildings usually have no existing infrastructure for
   reporting energy use of devices within them.  There are products
   available that can monitor and track whole-building use, either from
   added hardware, or by leveraging a communicating meter.  However,
   this gives no visibilty to how much electricity is being consumed by
   each device.  There are expensive systems available for houses that
   integrate control of many systems (e.g. climate control, lighting,
   security, entertainment) that can incorporate tracking of usage times
   and so well approximate energy use, but these are generally
   proprietary and not IP-based.

   Residential buildings that incorporate multiple units are best dealt
   with as each unit being a separate building for NMS purposes.
   Privacy and security both preclude sharing much information outside
   the NMS, except for services that are centrally provided (e.g. hot
   water or space conditioning).  Such buildings also have energy used
   in common areas and common functions.

3.2.2.  Commercial

   Commercial buildings vary enormously in scale, with some smaller than
   a typical house, to entire campuses of multi-story buildings.
   Smaller buildings share many characteristics with houses in terms of
   technology and management styles.  Larger buildings usually have some
   sorts of building control systems, though usually there are several
   systems for individual types of functions, and most are not IP-based.
   Thus, while some energy information can usually be extracted
   digitally, it is usually not comprehensive, and often derived from
   proprietary systems.

   Some commercial buildings have the multi-tenant character of some
   residential buildings, though the degree to which services are the
   responsibility of the building owner is greater than with
   residential.

3.2.3.  Vehicles

   While it may initially seem curious to treat automobiles, airplanes,
   and boats as types of buildings, for purposes of energy management,
   it is quite appropriate.  They are generally self-contained
   structures with electricity distribution for a variety of uses (some
   infrastructure and some occupant oriented).  Electricity is typically
   more expensive in energy and carbon terms than for fixed buildings
   and may have constrained capacity, so the reason to be concerned with
   energy management is even greater with vehicles.

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


3.3.  Device types

   The EMAN facility is designed to be used for any device type.

3.3.1.  Information technology

   For many years, the only devices on IP networks were computers and
   network equipment.  To these were added other types of information
   technology devices, such as printers and storage.  Even televisions
   have a primary purpose of displaying information, and thus the
   traditional category of entertainment consumer electronics can be
   logically grouped under information technology.  These devices are at
   the core of EMAN and will see the widest initial use of EMAN
   reporting.

3.3.2.  Non-electronic devices

   "Electronics" are devices whose primary function is information so
   that "non-electronics" is everything else in buildings, such as
   lighting, appliances, and equipment for space conditioning.  This
   term does not imply that they have no electronic components, but
   rather that


4.  Framework summary

   The Framework document [REF] provides a detailed description of the
   architecture of the EMAN system.  This section provides a brief
   summary of that architecture.

   NOTE: This summary is highly informed by .  To the extent that there
   are differences between this summmary and the architecture document,
   this is a proposal to modify the architecture.

4.1.  Power distribution

   An aspect of energy reporting that may not be initially apparent is
   how it can support understanding of power distribution systems.  That
   is, different collections of devices in a building may be in
   different 'domains' of electricity distribution, with a common fate
   (e.g. downstream of a circuit breaker), or under the same electricity
   meter.  This is accomplished two ways: via reporting by products
   which have a power distribution function themselves (e.g. a Power
   Distribution Unit or an Ethernet switch that supports Power over
   Ethernet).

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


5.  Discovery

   A Network Management System requires some method of collecting a list
   of the entities on the network that it needs to be cognizant of, both
   when it initially begins operation, and maintaining this on an
   ongoing basis as the population of devices evolves.  There are three
   basic methods: protocol, manual, and opportunistic.  A NMS can
   utilize more than one method.

   In the protocol approach, the NMS periodically broadcasts a request
   for any EMAN reporting entity to identify itself to the NMS.  For
   each entity that replies, the NMS queries it for the specific
   information it has.

   In the manual approach, the identity of each device to be managed is
   provided to the NMS.  Usually, additional information will also be
   provided, such as functional relationships among devices, policies to
   be employed (e.g. prioritization of the importance of each device),
   and control strategies (e.g. under what conditions a device should be
   have its power supply removed or reinstated).

   In the opportunistic approach, the NMS observes the network to notice
   when a new device appears, then queries it for EMAN capabilities.

   A NMS may also participate in one or more service discovery protocols
   to determine when a new device appears, though as none of these
   protocols are universal, this will always be an incomplete method.  A
   NMS also has to deal with the fact that some devices will eventually
   disappear from the network and need to be expired from its databases.
   Also, some devices will be only intermittently on the network, either
   from being physically absent some of the time, or powered down to a
   low-power state in which they can't respond to EMAN queries.


6.  Related Standards and Activities

   This section reviews related standards and other activities that have
   some relationship to the EMAN protocol.

6.1.  Standards that inform measurement

   There are many energy test procedures for specific products.  These
   generally are for tests conducted in laboratory conditions in
   specified configurations to assess energy performance for comparison
   to other models or criteria levels.  However, EMAN measurements are
   not conducted in a laboratory, not under such specified conditions,
   and need to be universal across all products, so a "horizontal" test
   procedure is more relevant.  The most widely used of these is IEC



Nordman                 Expires September 8, 2011               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


   62301 on measurement of standby power.  While 62301 was created by a
   committee with a mandate on household appliances, it has been
   designed to be universal for any product commonly found in
   residential or commercial buildings, and is referenced in test
   procedures for appliances, electronics, and other devices.

6.2.  Standards that inform reporting

   Energy reporting over networks is a relatively new service.  Few
   devices had the hardware ability to measure power, and few of the
   rest made an attempt to estimate it.  Further, for power state,
   devices could only report when they were fully on, so never could
   report themselves when in a low power state.  Finally, the ability to
   remotely apply or remove power from a device has been confined to
   very specific usage environments.

6.2.1.  DMTF

   The Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) has specified
   communication of power state information.

   The DMTF Common Information Model (CIM) includes information about
   power states.

6.2.2.  Ecma SDC

   The Ecma International committee on Smart Data Centre (TC38-SDC) is
   in the process of defining semantics for management of entities in a
   data center such as servers, network equipment, etc.  It covers
   energy as one of many functional resources or attributes of systems
   for measurement and/or control.  It only defines terms and variables,
   and does not reference any specific protocol.  Its goal is to enable
   interoperability of such protocols by ensuring a common semantic
   model across them.

   The SDC process is still underway, with a timeframe similar to EMAN.
   There seems to be no fundamental barrier to the two efforts to
   harmonize on aspects they have in common.  These include identity,
   power states, power levels, accumulated energy use, and tracking of
   time.

6.3.  Other Standards and Programs

   While manufacturers may implement EMAN capabilities in their
   products, their are other organizations that may also do this.
   Future standards may reference EMAN as functionality that more
   comprehensive systems rely on.  They may also define extensions to or
   particular uses of the EMAN facility.



Nordman                 Expires September 8, 2011              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


   In future, energy standards, both voluntary and mandatory, may reward
   or require use of EMAN capabilities.  For example, the Energy Star
   program already references other specific network technologies in a
   variety of its specifications.  In fact, the initial framework
   document for revising the Energy Star Computer specification
   references the IETF eman activity.  The most likely use of EMAN would
   be simply for a device to be able to report on its own basic status
   as defined by EMAN, such as identity, power state, power level, and
   accumulated energy.

6.3.1.  Smart Grid

   There are many definitions of what constitutes the "Smart Grid".  In
   the most general sense, it is the application of information
   technology to our electricity system, so that the EMAN framework is
   an excellent example of that.  Alternatively, it can describe using
   information technology to improve the electricity grid, from the
   power plant through transmission and distribution systems and ending
   at the meter.  In this case, the EMAN framework has no connection to
   the Smart Grid.  The most common definitions of the Smart Grid
   acknowledge that what occurs in buildings is different from the
   utility-managed grid, but specify some communication directly between
   the grid and end-use devices.  The EMAN framework does not anticipate
   communication with entities outside the building, but rather only
   with a local NMS.  The NMS could communicate with the grid, but that
   is well outside the EMAN scope and framework.  End-use devices can
   still coordinate with the grid through other protocols, either in
   one-way communication (receiving demand response or direct price
   signals from the grid), or in two-way communication with the grid.


7.  Security Considerations

   The energy management facilities discussed here raise a number of
   security considerations.  While not a part of the current drafts, the
   ability of one device to control the power state of a second
   connected device can be a problem if they do not share the same
   management goal.  This can be either the act of powering down a
   device (e.g. from on to sleep or off), rendering it unable to perform
   ordinary services it might otherwise accomplish, or powering the
   device up, and consequently using energy resources not otherwise
   desired.  Beyond control, simple information about the current or
   historic energy use of a device can indicate details of occupancy of
   the main person using the device, or of applications running on the
   device.

   The capabilities described in this document do not introduce any new
   capabilities for security.  Rather, any device that implements them

Internet-Draft     Energy perspective on applicability        March 2011


   must use existing security intrastructure and policies.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo creates several possible actions for IANA.  First is a
   single canonical listing of "identity" of a device, in terms of what
   it is.  Second is possible enumeration of power states, and/or
   functional states.
