Internet-Draft         QoS Attributes for Diameter             July 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a number of Diameter Quality of Service (QoS)
   related AVPs that can be used in existing and future Diameter
   applications where permitted by the ABNF of a command.  The
   IPFilterRule AVP, defined in RFC 3588 [RFC3588], and the QoS-Filter-
   Rule AVP, defined in RFC 4005 [RFC4005], provide basic support for
   classification and QoS already.  The classification rule syntax is a
   modified subset of FreeBSD ipfw packet filter implementation.  The
   QoS functionality provided by the IPFilterRule AVP was updated by the
   QoS-Filter-Rule AVP.  The QoS-Rule AVP offers an extended way of
   expressing classification and QoS capabilities.

   The QoS-Resources AVP represents a complete rule set with each rule
   represented by a QoS-Rule AVP.  Each rule consists of a conditions
   part and the corresponding actions to be performed if the conditions
   are satisfied.  The AVPs responsible for expressing a condition are
   defined in Section 4.  The capability to match all or a subset of the
   data traffic is provided and this includes the ability to match on
   Ethernet specific attributes which was not possible with the QoS-
   Filter-Rule AVP.  Additionally, time-based conditions can be
   expressed based on the functionality offered in Section 4.2.  The
   action part of a rule contains information for handling conflict
   resolution, such as a priority value for each individual rule within
   a rule set, and further description regarding QoS related actions.

   The QoS policy rules are defined as Diameter encoded Attribute Value
   Pairs (AVPs) described using a modified version of the Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF), see [RFC3588].  The AVP datatypes are also
   taken from [RFC3588].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Rule Sets and Rules

   As mentioned in the introduction the top-level element is the QoS-
   Resources AVP that encapsulates one or more QoS-Rule AVPs.

3.1.  QoS-Resources AVP

   The QoS-Resources AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and contains
   a list of QoS policy rules.

                   * [ AVP ]

3.2.  QoS-Rule AVP

   The QoS-Rule AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and defines a
   specific condition and action combination.


                       QoS-Rule ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
                                    [ QoS-Rule-Precedence ]

                                    ; ------------------------

                                    ; --------------------

                                    [ QoS-Action ]

                                    ; Info about QoS related Actions
                                    ; ------------------------------

                                    [ QoS-Semantics ]
                                    [ QoS-Profile-Template ]
                                    [ QoS-Parameters ]
                                    [ Excess-Treatment ]


                                    ; Extension Point
                                    ; ---------------
                                  * [ AVP ]

   If the QoS-Profile-Template AVP is not included in the Qos-Rule AVP
   then the default setting is assumed, namely a setting of the
   Vendor-Id AVP to 0 (for IETF) and the QoS-Profile-Id AVP to zero (0)
   (for the profile defined in [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-parameters]).  Note
   that the content of the QoS-Parameters are defined in the respective
   specification defining the QoS parameters.  When the Vendor-Id AVP is
   set to 0 (for IETF) and the QoS-Profile-Id AVP is set to zero (0)
   then the AVPs included in the QoS-Parameters AVP are the AVPs defined
   in [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-parameters].

3.3.  QoS-Rule-Precedence AVP

   The QoS-Rule-Precedence AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32 and
   specifies the execution order of the rules expressed in the QoS-
   Resources AVP.  The lower the numerical value of QoS-Rule-Precedence
   AVP, the higher the rule precedence.  Rules with equal precedence MAY
   be executed in parallel if supported by the Resource Management
   Function.  If the QoS-Rule-Precedence AVP is absent from the QoS-Rule
   AVP, the rules SHOULD be executed in the order in which they appear
   in the QoS-Resources AVP.


4.  Conditions

   This section describes the condition part of a rule.  Two condition
   types are introduced by this document: packet classification
   conditions represented by the Classifier AVP and time of day
   conditions represented by the Time-Of-Day-Condition AVP.

   If more than one instance of the Time-Of-Day-Condition AVP is present
   in the QoS-Rule AVP, the current time at QoS rule evaluation MUST be
   within at least one of the time windows specified in one of the Time-
   Of-Day-Condition AVPs.

   When the Time-Of-Day-Condition AVP and Classifier AVP are present in
   the same QoS-Rule AVP, both the time of day and packet classification
   conditions MUST match for the QoS specification action to be applied.

4.1.  Traffic Classifiers

   Classifiers are used in many applications to specify how to select a
   subset of data packets for subsequent treatment as indicated in the
   action part of a rule.  For example in a QoS application, if a packet
   matches a classifier then that packet will be treated in accordance
   with a QoS specification associated with that classifier.  Figure 1
   shows a typical deployment.

              Figure 1: Example of a Classifier Architecture

   The managed terminal, the terminal for which the classifiers are
   being specified is located on the left of the Classifying Entity.
   The unmanaged terminals, the terminals that receive packets from the
   Managed terminal or send packets to the managed terminal are located
   to the right side of the Classifying Entity.

   The Classifying Entity is responsible for classifying packets that
   are incoming (IN) from the Managed Terminal or packets outgoing (OUT)
   to the Managed Terminal.

   A Classifier consists of a group of attributes that specify how to
   match a packet.  Each set of attributes expresses values about
   aspects of the packet - typically the packet header.  Different
   protocols therefore would use different attributes.

   In general a Classifier consists of the following:

   Identifier:

      The identifier uniquely identifies this classifier and may be used
      to reference the classifier from another structure.

   From:

      Specifies the rule for matching the protocol specific source
      address(es) part of the packet.

   To:

      Specifies the rule for matching the protocol specific destination
      address(es) part of the packet.

   Protocol:

      Specifies the matching protocol of the packet.

   Direction:

      Specifies whether the classifier is to apply to packets flowing
      from the Managed Terminal (IN) or to packets flowing to the
      Managed Terminal (OUT), or packets flowing in both direction.

   Options:

      Attributes or properties associated with each protocol or layer,
      or various values specific to the header of the protocol or layer.
      Options allow matching on those values.


   Each protocol type will have a specific set of attributes that can be
   used to specify a classifier for that protocol.  These attributes
   will be grouped under a grouped AVP called a Classifier AVP.

4.1.1.  Classifier AVP

   The Classifier AVP (AVP Code TBD) is a grouped AVP that consists of a

4.1.2.  Classifier-ID AVP

   The Classifier-ID AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and
   uniquely identifies the classifier.  Each application will define the
   uniqueness scope of this identifier, e.g. unique per terminal or
   globally unique.  Exactly one Classifier-ID AVP MUST be contained
   within a Classifier AVP.

4.1.3.  Protocol AVP

   The Protocol AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated and specifies
   the protocol being matched.  The attributes included in the
   Classifier AVP MUST be consistent with the value of the Protocol AVP.
   Exactly zero or one Protocol AVP may be contained within a Classifier
   AVP.  If the Protocol AVP is omitted from the Classifier, then
   comparison of the protocol of the packet is irrelevant.  The values
   for this AVP are managed by IANA under the Protocol Numbers registry
   as defined in [RFC2780].

4.1.4.  Direction AVP

   The Direction AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated and specifies
   in which direction to apply the Classifier.  The values of the
   enumeration are: "IN","OUT","BOTH".  In the "IN" and "BOTH"
   directions, the From-Spec refers to the address of the Managed
   Terminal and the To-Spec refers to the unmanaged terminal.  In the
   "OUT" direction, the From-Spec refers to the Unmanaged Terminal
   whereas the To-Spec refers to the Managed Terminal.  If the Direction
   AVP is omitted, the Classifier matches packets flowing in both
   directions.


     Value | Name and Semantic
     ------+--------------------------------------------------
       0   | IN - The classifier applies to flows from the
           | Managed Terminal.
       1   | OUT - The classifier applies to flows to the
           | Managed Terminal.
       2   | BOTH - The classifier applies to flows both to
           | and from the Managed Terminal.

4.1.5.  From-Spec AVP

   The From-Spec AVP (AVP Code TBD) is a grouped AVP that specifies the
   Source Specification used to match the packet.  Zero or more of these
   AVPs may appear in the Classifier.  If this AVP is absent from the
   Classifier then all packets are matched regardless of the source
   address.  If more than one instance of this AVP appears in the

   Classifier then the source of the packet can match any From-Spec AVP.
   The contents of this AVP are protocol specific.

   If one instance (or multiple instances) of the IP address AVP (IP-
   Address, IP-Address-Range, IP-Address-Mask, Use-Assigned-Address)
   appear in the From-Spec AVP then the source IP address of the packet
   MUST match one of the addresses represented by these AVPs.

   If more that one instance of the layer 2 address AVPs (MAC-Address,
   MAC-Address-Mask, EUI64-Address, EUI64-Address-Mask) appears in the
   From-Spec then the the source layer 2 address of the packet MUST
   match one of the addresses represented in these AVPs.

   If more that one instance of the port AVPs (Port, Port-Range) appears
   in the From-Spec AVP then the source port number MUST match one of
   the port numbers represented in these AVPs.

   If the IP address, MAC address and port AVPs appear in the same From-
   Spec AVP then the source packet MUST match all the specifications,
   i.e. match the IP address AND MAC address AND port number.


   From-Spec ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
               * [ IP-Address ]
               * [ IP-Address-Range ]

                 [ Use-Assigned-Address ]
               * [ AVP ]

4.1.6.  To-Spec AVP

   The To-Spec AVP (AVP Code TBD) is a grouped AVP that specifies the
   Destination Specification used to match the packet.  Zero or more of
   these AVPs may appear in the Classifier.  If this AVP is absent from
   the Classifier then all packets are matched regardless of the
   destination address.  If more than one instance of this AVP appears
   in the Classifier then the destination of the packet can match any
   To-Spec AVP.  The contents of this AVP are protocol specific.

   If one instance (or multiple instances) of the IP address AVP (IP-
   Address, IP-Address-Range, IP-Address-Mask, Use-Assigned-Address)

   appear in the To-Spec AVP then the destination IP address of the
   packet MUST match one of the addresses represented by these AVPs.

   If more that one instance of the layer 2 address AVPs (MAC-Address,
   MAC-Address-Mask, EUI64-Address, EUI64-Address-Mask) appears in the
   To-Spec then the the destination layer 2 address of the packet MUST
   match one of the addresses represented in these AVPs.

   If more that one instance of the port AVPs (Port, Port-Range) appears
   in the To-Spec AVP then the destination port number MUST match one of
   the port numbers represented in these AVPs.

   If the IP address, MAC address and port AVPs appear in the same To-
   Spec AVP then the destination packet MUST match all the
   specifications, i.e. match the IP address AND MAC address AND port
   number.


   To-Spec ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
             * [ IP-Address ]
             * [ IP-Address-Range ]
             * [ IP-Address-Mask ]
             * [ MAC-Address ]
             * [ MAC-Address-Mask]
             * [ EUI64-Address ]
             * [ EUI64-Address-Mask]
             * [ Port ]
             * [ Port-Range ]
               [ Negated ]
               [ Use-Assigned-Address ]
             * [ AVP ]

4.1.7.  Source and Destination AVPs

   For packet classification the contents of the From-Spec and To-Spec
   can contain the AVPs listed in the subsections below.

4.1.7.1.  Negated AVP

   The Negated AVP (AVP Code TBD) of type Enumerated containing the
   values of True or False.  Exactly zero or one of these AVPs may
   appear in the From-Spec or To-Spec AVP.

   When set to True the meaning of the match is inverted.  Addresses
   other than those in the To-Spec and From-Spec are to be matched
   instead.  When set to False, or when the AVP is not included then the
   address specified To-Spec and From-Spec AVP are to be matched.

   starts at the address specified by the IP-Address-Start AVP and
   includes all the remaining valid IP addresses.

   For the IP-Address-Range AVP to be valid, the IP-Address-Start AVP
   MUST contain a value that is less than that of the IP-Address-End
   AVP.

   If the ICMP-Code AVP is present, the value MUST match that in the
   ICMP header.  If the ICMP-Code AVP is absent, the ICMP type MUST be
   present in the ICMP header but the code is wild carded.

   The Negated AVP is used in conjunction with the ICMP-Code AVPs to
   specify ICMP codes that do not match specific values.  The Negated
   AVP is used without the ICMP-Code AVP to specify ICMP headers which
   do not contain the ICMP type.  As such, the Negated AVP feature
   applies to ICMP-Code AVP if the ICMP-Code AVP is present.  If the
   ICMP-Code AVP is absent, the Negated AVP feature applies to the ICMP-
   Type-Number.

4.1.8.12.  ICMP-Type-Number AVP

   The ICMP-Type-Number AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated and the
   values are managed by IANA under the ICMP Type Numbers registry as
   defined in [RFC2780].

4.1.8.13.  ICMP-Code AVP

   The ICMP-Code AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated and the values
   are managed by IANA under the ICMP Type Numbers registry as defined
   in [RFC2780].

4.1.8.14.  ETH-Option AVP

   The ETH-Option AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and specifies
   Ethernet specific attributes.


   ETH-Option ::= < AVP Header: XXX >

4.1.8.15.  ETH-Proto-Type AVP

   The Eth-Proto-Type AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and
   specifies the encapsulated protocol type.  ETH-Ether-Type and ETH-SAP
   are mutually exclusive.


   ETH-Proto-Type ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
                    * [ ETH-Ether-Type ]
                    * [ ETH-SAP ]
                    * [ AVP ]

4.1.8.16.  ETH-Ether-Type AVP

   The ETH-Ether-Type AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString.  The
   value is a double octet that contains the value of the Ethertype
   field in the packet to match.  This AVP MAY be present in the case of
   DIX or if SNAP is present at 802.2 but the ETH-SAP AVP MUST NOT be
   present in this case.

4.1.8.17.  ETH-SAP AVP

   The ETH-SAP AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString.  The value is
   a double octet representing the 802.2 SAP as specified in
   [IEEE802.2].  The first octet contains the DSAP and the second the
   SSAP.

4.1.8.18.  VLAN-ID-Range AVP

   The VLAN-ID-Range AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and specifies
   the VLAN range to match.  VLAN identities are either specified by a
   single VLAN-ID according to [IEEE802.1Q] or by a combination of
   Customer and Service VLAN-IDs according to [IEEE802.1ad].

   The single VLAN-ID is represented by the C-VID-Start and C-VID-End
   AVPs and the S-VID-Start and S-VID-End AVPs SHALL be ommitted in this
   case.  If the VLAN-ID-Range AVP is omitted from the Classifier, then
   comparison of the VLAN identity of the packet is irrelevant.


   VLAN-ID-Range ::= < AVP Header: XXX >

   and S-VID-End AVPs and their inference:

   o  If S-VID-Start AVP is present but the S-VID-End AVP is absent, the
      S-VID-Start AVP value MUST equal the value of the IEEE 802.1ad
      S-VID bits specified in [IEEE802.1ad] for a successful match.
   o  If S-VID-Start AVP is absent but the S-VID-End AVP is present, the
      S-VID-End AVP value MUST equal the value of the IEEE 802.1ad S-VID
      bits for a successful match.
   o  If both S-VID-Start and S-VID-End AVPs are present and their
      values are equal, the S-VID-Start AVP value MUST equal the value
      of the IEEE 802.1ad S-VID bits for a successful match.
   o  If both S-VID-Start and S-VID-End AVPs are present and the value
      of S-VID-End AVP is greater than the value of the S-VID-Start AVP,
      the value of the IEEE 802.1ad S-VID bits MUST be greater than or
      equal to the S-VID- Start AVP value and less than or equal to the
      S-VID-End AVP value for a successful match.  If the S-VID-Start
      and S-VID-End AVPs are specified, then Ethernet packets without
      IEEE 802.1ad encapsulation MUST NOT match this Classifier.
   o  If the S-VID-Start and S-VID-End AVPs are omitted, then existence
      of IEEE802.1ad encapsulation or comparison of the IEEE 802.1ad
      S-VID bits is irrelevant for this Classifier.

   The following is the list of possible combinations of the C-VID-Start
   and C-VID-End AVPs and their inference:

   o  If C-VID-Start AVP is present but the C-VID-End AVP is absent, the
      C-VID-Start AVP value MUST equal the value of the IEEE 802.1ad
      C-VID bits specified in [IEEE802.1ad] or the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN-ID
      bits specified in [IEEE802.1Q] for a successful match.
   o  If C-VID-Start AVP is absent but the C-VID-End AVP is present, the
      C-VID-End AVP value MUST equal the value of the IEEE 802.1ad C-VID
      bits or the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN-ID bits for a successful match.
   o  If both C-VID-Start and C-VID-End AVPs are present and their
      values are equal, the C-VID-Start AVP value MUST equal the value
      of the IEEE 802.1ad C-VID bits or the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN-ID bits for
      a successful match.
   o  If both C-VID-Start and C-VID-End AVPs are present and the value
      of C-VID-End AVP is greater than the value of the C-VID-Start AVP,
      the value of the IEEE 802.1ad C-VID bits or the IEEE 802.1Q
      VLAN-ID bits MUST be greater than or equal to the C-VID-Start AVP
      value and less than or equal to the C-VID-End AVP value for a
      successful match.  If the C-VID-Start and C-VID-End AVPs are
      specified, then Ethernet packets without IEEE 802.1ad or IEEE
      802.1Q encapsulation MUST NOT match this Classifier.
   o  If the C-VID-Start and C-VID-End AVPs are omitted, the comparison
      of the IEEE 802.1ad C-VID bits or IEEE 802.1Q VLAN-ID bits for
      this Classifier is irrelevant.

4.1.8.19.  S-VID-Start AVP

   The S-VID-Start AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.  The value
   MUST be in the range from 0 to 4095.  The value of this AVP specifies
   the start value of the range of S-VID VLAN-IDs to be matched.

4.1.8.20.  S-VID-End AVP

   The S-VID-End AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.  The value
   MUST be in the range from 0 to 4095.  The value of this AVP specifies

   The User-Priority-Range AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and
   specifies an inclusive range to match the user_priority parameter
   specified in [IEEE802.1D].  An Ethernet packet containing the
   user_priority parameter matches this Classifier if the value is
   greater than or equal to Low-User-Priority and less than or equal to
   High-User-Priority.  If this AVP is omitted, then comparison of the
   IEEE 802.1D user_priority parameter for this Classifier is
   irrelevant.

4.1.8.25.  High-User-Priority AVP

   The High-User-Priority AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.  The
   value MUST be in the range from 0 to 7.

4.2.  Time Of Day AVPs

   In many QoS applications, the QoS specification applied to the
   traffic flow is conditional upon the time of day when the flow was
   observed.  The following sections define AVPs that can be used to
   express one or more time windows which determine when a QoS
   specification is applicable to a traffic flow.

4.2.1.  Time-Of-Day-Condition AVP

   The Time-Of-Day-Condition AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and
   specifies one or more time windows.


   Time-Of-Day-Condition ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
                             [ Time-Of-Day-Start ]
                             [ Time-Of-Day-End ]
                             [ Day-Of-Week-Mask ]
                             [ Day-Of-Month-Mask ]
                             [ Month-Of-Year-Mask ]
                             [ Absolute-Start-Time ]
                             [ Absolute-End-Time ]
                             [ Timezone-Flag ]
                           * [ AVP ]

   For example, a time window for 9am to 5pm (local time) from Monday to
   Friday would be expressed as:

   Time-Of-Day-Condition = {
       Time-Of-Day-Start = 32400;
       Time-Of-Day-End = 61200;
       Day-Of-Week-Mask =
           ( MONDAY | TUESDAY | WEDNESDAY | THURSDAY | FRIDAY );
       Timezone-Flag = LOCAL;
   }

4.2.2.  Time-Of-Day-Start AVP

   The Time-Of-Day-Start AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.  The
   value MUST be in the range from 0 to 86400.  The value of this AVP
   specifies the start of an inclusive time window expressed as the
   offset in seconds from midnight.  If this AVP is absent from the
   Time-Of-Day-Condition AVP, the time window starts at midnight.

4.2.3.  Time-Of-Day-End AVP

   The Time-Of-Day-End AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.  The
   value MUST be in the range from 1 to 86400.  The value of this AVP
   specifies the end of an inclusive time window expressed as the offset
   in seconds from midnight.  If this AVP is absent from the Time-Of-
   Day-Condition AVP, the time window ends one second before midnight.

4.2.4.  Day-Of-Week-Mask AVP

   The Day-Of-Week-Mask AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.  The
   value is a bitmask which specifies the day of the week for the time
   window to match.  This document specifies the following bits:

      Bit  | Name
     ------+------------
       0   | SUNDAY
       1   | MONDAY

       4   | THURSDAY
       5   | FRIDAY
       6   | SATURDAY

   The bit MUST be set for the time window to match on the corresponding
   day of the week.  Bit 0 is the most significant bit and unused bits
   MUST be cleared.  If this AVP is absent from the Time-Of-Day-
   Condition AVP, the time windows match on all days of the week.

4.2.5.  Day-Of-Month-Mask AVP

   The Day-Of-Month AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.  The value
   MUST be in the range from 0 to 2147483647.  The value is a bitmask
   which specifies the days of the month where bit 0 represents the
   first day of the month through to bit 30 which represents the last
   day of the month.  The bit MUST be set for the time window to match
   on the corresponding day of the month.  Bit 0 is the most significant
   bit and unused bits MUST be cleared.  If this AVP is absent from the
   Time-Of-Day-Condition AVP, the time windows match on all days of the
   month.

4.2.6.  Month-Of-Year-Mask AVP

   The Month-Of-Year-Mask AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.  The
   value is a bitmask which specifies the months of the year for the
   time window to match.  This document specifies the following bits:

       8   | SEPTEMBER
       9   | OCTOBER
       10  | NOVEMBER
       11  | DECEMBER

   The bit MUST be set for the time window to match on the corresponding
   month of the year.  Bit 0 is the most significant bit and unused bits
   MUST be cleared.  If this AVP is absent from the Time-Of-Day-
   Condition AVP, the time windows match during all months of the year.

4.2.7.  Absolute-Start-Time AVP

   The Absolute-Start-Time AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Time.  The
   value of this AVP specifies the time in seconds since January 1,
   1900, 00:00 UTC when the time window starts.  If this AVP is absent
   from the Time-Of-Day-Condition AVP, the time window starts on January
   1, 1900, 00:00 UTC.

4.2.8.  Absolute-Start-Fractional-Seconds AVP

   The Absolute-Start-Fractional-Seconds AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type
   Unsigned32.  The value specifies the fractional seconds that are
   added to Absolute-Start-Time value in order to deterimine when the
   time window starts.  If this AVP is absent from the Time-Of-Day-
   Condition AVP then the fractional seconds are assumed to be zero.

4.2.9.  Absolute-End-Time AVP

   The Time-Of-Day-End AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Time.  The value of
   this AVP specifies the time in seconds since January 1, 1900, 00:00
   UTC when the time window ends.  If this AVP is absent from the Time-
   Of-Day-Condition AVP, the time window is open-ended.

4.2.10.  Absolute-End-Fractional-Seconds AVP

   The Absolute-End-Fractional-Seconds AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type
   Unsigned32.  The value specifies the fractional seconds that are
   added to Absolute-End-Time value in order to deterimine when the time

   window ends.  If this AVP is absent from the Time-Of-Day-Condition
   AVP then the fractional seconds are assumed to be zero.

4.2.11.  Timezone-Flag AVP

   The Timezone-Flag AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated and
   indicates whether the time windows are specified in UTC, local time
   at the managed terminal or as an offset from UTC.  If this AVP is
   absent from the Time-Of-Day-Condition AVP, the time windows are in
   UTC.

   This document defines the following values:

     Value | Name and Semantic
     ------+--------------------------------------------------
       0   | UTC - The time windows are expressed in UTC.
       1   | LOCAL - The time windows are expressed in local
           | time at the Managed Terminal.
       2   | OFFSET - The time windows are expressed as an
           | offset from UTC (see Timezone-Offset AVP).

4.2.12.  Timezone-Offset AVP

   The Timezone-Offset AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Integer32.  The
   value of this AVP MUST be in the range from -43200 to 43200.  It
   specifies the offset in seconds from UTC that was used to express
   Time-Of-Day-Start, Time-Of-Day-End, Day-Of-Week-Mask, Day-Of-Month-
   Mask and Month-Of-Year-Mask AVPs.  This AVP MUST be present if the
   Timezone-Flag AVP is set to OFFSET.


5.  Actions

   This section defines the actions associated with a rule.  This
   document only defines QoS specific actions but further actions can be
   specified as extensions.

5.1.  QoS-Action AVP

   The QoS-Action AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated and lists the
   actions that are associated with the condition part of a rule.  The
   following actions are defined in this document:


      0: drop
      1: shape
      2: mark




Korhonen, et al.        Expires January 14, 2010               [Page 26]

Internet-Draft         QoS Attributes for Diameter             July 2009


   drop:

      All traffic that is met by the condition part of a rule MUST be
      dropped.  This action implements firewalling functionality.

   shape:

      [RFC2475] describes shaping as "the process of delaying packets
      within a traffic stream to cause it to conform to some defined
      traffic profile".  When the action is set to 'shape', it is
      expected that the QoS-Parameters AVP carries QoS information to
      indicate how to shape the traffic indicated in the condition part
      of the rule.

   mark:

      [RFC2475] describes marking as "the process of setting the DS
      codepoint in a packet based on defined rules".  When the action is
      set to 'mark', it is expected that the QoS-Parameters AVP carries
      information about the DiffServ marking.


   Further action values can be registered, as described in
   Section 10.3.

   [RFC2475] also describes an action called "policing" as "the process
   of discarding packets (by a dropper) within a traffic stream in
   accordance with the state of a corresponding meter enforcing a
   traffic profile".  This behavior in modeled in the QoS-Rule through
   the inclusion of the Excess-Treatment AVP containing a QoS-Action AVP
   set to "drop".

5.2.  QoS-Profile-Id AVP

   The QoS-Profile-Id AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32 and
   contains a QoS profile template identifier.  An initial QoS profile
   template is defined with value of 0 and can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-parameters].  The registry for the QoS profile
   templates is created with the same document.

5.3.  QoS-Profile-Template AVP

   The QoS-Profile-Template AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and
   defines the namespace of the QoS profile (indicated in the Vendor-ID
   AVP) followed by the specific value for the profile.

   The Vendor-Id AVP contains a 32 bit IANA Private Enterprise Number
   (PEN) and the QoS-Profile-Id AVP contains the template identifier

5.4.  QoS-Semantics

   The QoS-Semantics AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated and
   provides the semantics for the QoS-Profile-Template and QoS-
   Parameters AVPs in the QoS-Rule AVP.

   This document defines the following values:

    (0): QoS-Desired
    (1): QoS-Available
    (2): QoS-Reserved
    (3): Minimum-QoS
    (4): QoS-Authorized

   The semantic of the QoS parameters depend on the information provided
   in the list above.  The semantics of the different values are as
   follows:

   Object Type    Direction   Semantic
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   QoS-Desired     C->S       Please authorize the indicated QoS
   QoS-Desired     C<-S       NA
   QoS-Available   C->S       Admission Control at interface indicates
                              that this QoS is available. (note 1)
   QoS-Available   C<-S       Indicated QoS is available. (note 2)
   QoS-Reserved    C->S       Used for reporting during accounting.
   QoS-Reserved    C<-S       NA
   Minimum-QoS     C->S       Indicates that the client is not
                              interested in authorizing QoS that is
                              lower than Min. QoS.
   Minimum-QoS     C<-S       The client must not provide QoS
                              guarantees lower than Min. QoS.
   QoS-Authorized  C->S       NA
   QoS-Authorized  C<-S       Indicated QoS authorized

   Legend:

     C: Diameter client
     S: Diameter server
     NA: Not applicable to this document;
         no semantic defined in this specification

   Notes:

    (1) QoS-Available is only useful in relationship with QoS-Desired
        (and optionally with Minimum-QoS).
    (2) QoS-Available is only useful when the AAA server performs
        admission control and knows about the resources in the network.

5.5.  QoS-Parameters AVP

   The QoS-Parameters AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type grouped and contains
   Quality of Service parameters.  These parameters are defined in
   separate documents and depend on the indicated QoS profile template
   of the QoS-Profile-Template AVP.  For an initial QoS parameter
   specification see [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-parameters].


   QoS-Parameters  ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
                        * [ AVP ]

5.6.  Excess-Treatment AVP

   The Excess-Treatment AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type grouped and
   indicates how out-of-profile traffic, i.e. traffic not covered by the
   original QoS-Profile-Template and QoS-Parameters AVPs, is treated.



Korhonen, et al.        Expires January 14, 2010               [Page 29]

Internet-Draft         QoS Attributes for Diameter             July 2009


   The additional QoS-Action, QoS-Profile-Template and QoS-Parameters
   AVPs carried inside the Excess-Treatment AVP provide information
   about the QoS treatment of the excess traffic.  In case the Excess-
   Treatment AVP is absent then the treatment of the out-of-profile
   traffic is left to the discretion of the node performing QoS
   treatment.


   Excess-Treatment ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
                        { QoS-Action }
                        [ QoS-Profile-Template ]
                        [ QoS-Parameters ]
                      * [ AVP ]


6.  QoS Capability Indication

   The QoS-Capability AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and contains
   a list of supported Quality of Service profile templates (and
   therefore the support of the respective parameter AVPs).

   The QoS-Capability AVP may be used for a simple announcement of the
   QoS capabilities and QoS profiles supported by a peer.  It may also
   be used to negotiate a mutually supported set of QoS capabilities and
   QoS profiles between two peers.  In such a case, handling of failed
   negotiations is application and/or deployment specific.


   QoS-Capability ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
                    1*{ QoS-Profile-Template }
                    * [ AVP ]

   The QoS-Profile-Template AVP is defined in Section 5.3.


7.  Examples

   This section shows a number of signaling flows where QoS negotiation
   and authorization is part of the conventional NASREQ, EAP or Credit
   Control applications message exchanges.  The signalling flows for the
   Diameter QoS Application are described in
   [I-D.ietf-dime-diameter-qos].

7.1.  Diameter EAP with QoS Information

   Figure 2 shows a simple signaling flow where a NAS (Diameter Client)
   announces its QoS awareness and capabilities included into the DER
   message and as part of the access authentication procedure.  Upon

   completion of the EAP exchange, the Diameter Server provides a pre-
   provisioned QoS profile with the QoS-Semantics in the QoS-Rule AVP
   set to "QoS-Authorized", to the NAS in the final DEA message.

   indicated QoS or rejects the request and informs the NAS about the
   result.  In this scenario the NAS does not need to include the QoS-
   Capability AVP in the AAR message as the QoS-Resources AVP implicitly
   does the same and also the NAS is authorizing a specific QoS profile,
   not a pre-provisioned one.

          Figure 4: Example of an Authorization-Only Message Flow

7.4.  Diameter Server Initiated Re-authorization of QoS

   Figure 5 shows a message exchange for a Diameter server initiated QoS
   re-authorization procedure.  The Diameter server sends the NAS a RAR
   message requesting re-authorization for an existing session and the
   NAS acknowledges it with a RAA message.  The NAS is aware of its
   existing QoS profile and information for the ongoing session that the
   Diameter server requested for re-authorization.  Thus, the NAS must
   initiate re-authorization of the existing QoS profile.  The re-
   authorization procedure is the same as in Figure 4.

   In this case the User is charged as soon as the Service Element (CC
   client) receives the service request.  In this case the client uses
   the "QoS-Desired" QoS-Semantics parameter in the QoS-Resources AVP
   that it sends to the Accounitng server.  The server responds with a
   "QoS-Available" QoS-Semantics parameter in the QoS-Resources AVP

7.7.  QoS Examples

   The following high level description aims to illustrate the
   interworking between the Diameter QoS AVPs defined in this document
   and the QoS parameters defined in [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-parameters].

   Consider the following example where a rule should be installed that
   limits traffic to 1 Mbit/sec and where out-of-profile traffic shall
   be dropped.The Classifers are ignored in this example.

   This would require the QoS-Action AVP to be set to 'shape' and the
   QoS-Parameters AVP carries the Bandwidth AVP indicating the 1 Mbit/
   sec limit.  The QoS-Action carried inside the Excess-Treatment AVP
   would be set to 'drop'.

   In a second, more complex scenario, we consider traffic marking with
   DiffServ.  In-profile traffic (of 5 Mbits/sec in our example) shall
   be associated with a particular PHB-Class "X".  Out-of-profile
   traffic shall belong to a different PHB-Class, in our example "Y".

   This configuration would require the QoS-Action AVP to be set to
   'mark'.  The QoS-Parameters AVPs for the traffic conforming of the

   profile contains two AVPs, namely the TMOD-1 AVP and the PHB-Class
   AVP.  The TMOD-1 AVP describes the traffic characteristics, namely 5
   Mbit/sec, and the PHB-Class AVP is set to class "X".  Then, the
   Excess-Treatment AVP has to be included with the QoS-Action AVP set
   to 'mark' and the QoS-Parameters AVP to carry another PHB-Class AVP
   indicating PHB-Class AVP setting to class "Y".
