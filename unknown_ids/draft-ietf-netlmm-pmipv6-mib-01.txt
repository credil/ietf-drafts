Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB),
   the Proxy Mobile-IPv6 MIB, for use with network management protocols
   in the Internet community.  In particular, the Proxy Mobile-IPv6 MIB
   will be used to monitor and control the mobile access gateway (MAG)
   node and the local mobility anchor (LMA) functions of a Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 (PMIPv6) entity.

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


2.  Overview

2.1.  The Proxy Mobile IPv6 Protocol and entities
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [PMIPv6] is an extension to the Mobile
   IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol which facilitates network-based localized
   mobility management (NETLMM) for IPv6 nodes in a PMIPv6 domain.
   There are three types of entities envisaged by the PMIPv6 protocol.

      mobile node (MN): In the PMIPv6 context the term mobile node
      is used to refer to an IP host or router whose mobility is
      managed by the network.

      local mobility anchor (LMA): Local Mobility Anchor is the
      home agent for the mobile node in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.
      It is the topological anchor point for the mobile node's home
      network prefix(es) and is the entity that manages the mobile
      node's binding state.  The local mobility anchor has the
      functional capabilities of a home agent as defined in Mobile
      IPv6 base specification [RFC3775] with the additional
      capabilities required for supporting Proxy Mobile IPv6
      protocol as defined in the PMIPv6 specification [RFC5213].

      mobile access gateway (MAG): Mobile Access Gateway is the
      entity on an access router that manages the mobility-related
      signaling for a mobile node that is attached to its access
      link.  It is responsible for tracking the mobile node's
      movements to and from the access link and for signaling the
      mobile node's local mobility anchor.

Internet Draft                  pmip6MIB                  September 2009


   This document defines a set of managed objects (MOs) that can be used
   to monitor and control PMIPv6 entities.

2.2.  Terminology
   The terminology used in this document is consistent with the
   definitions used in the Mobile IPv6 protocol specification[RFC3775]
   and in NETLMM Goals document [RFC4831].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Proxy Mobile IPv6 Monitoring and Control Requirements

   For managing a PMIPv6 entity it is necessary to monitor
   the following:
       o capabilities of PMIPv6 entities
       o traffic due to PMIPv6 signalling
       o binding related details (at LMA and MAG)
       o binding related statistics (at LMA and MAG)


4.  MIB Design.

   The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as possible
   and at the same time to make it effective enough so that the
   essential needs of monitoring and control are met.

   It is assumed that the Proxy Mobile IPv6 Management Information Base
   (PMIPV6-MIB) will always be implemented in conjunction with the
   MOBILEIPV6-MIB [RFC4295] and the ifTable from the IF-MIB [RFC2863].
   The PMIP6-MIB uses the textual conventions defined in the INET-
   ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001].

      The PMIPV6-MIB is composed of the following groups of definitions:

          - pmip6Core: a generic group containing objects that are
            common to all the Proxy Mobile IPv6 entities.
          - pmip6Mag: this group models the mobile access gateway
            service.
          - pmip6Lma: this group models the local mobility anchor
            service.
          - pmip6Notifications: defines the set of notifications that
            will be used to asynchronously monitor the Proxy Mobile

                                             interfaces.
          - pmip6MagBLTable                : models the Binding Update List

                                             maintained by the mobile

                                             parameters that are required
                                             by the network entities for
                                             managing the mobile node's

                                             LMA Address acts as a
                                             transport endpoint of the
                                             tunnel between the local

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These
   are the tables and objects and the corresponding
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
      nemoStatus: The value of this object is used to enable or disable
         the PMIPv6 functionality on a PMIPv6 entity. Access to this MO
         may be abused to disrupt the communication that depends on
   PMIPv6.
      pmip6MobileNodeGeneratedTimestampInUse :
      pmip6FixedMagLinkLocalAddressOnAllAccessLinksType:
      pmip6FixedMagLinkLocalAddressOnAllAccessLinks:
      pmip6FixedMagLinkLayerAddressOnAllAccessLinks:
      pmip6MagEnableMagLocalRouting:
      pmip6MagHomeNetworkPrefixLifeTime:
      pmip6LmaMinDelayBeforeBCEDelete:
      pmip6LmaMaxDelayBeforeNewBCEAssign:
      pmip6LmaTimestampValidityWindow:
      pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefixLifeTime:
         Access to the above MOs may be abused to misconfigure PMIPv6
         entities and disrupt communications.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefixType:
      pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefix:
      pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefixLength:
         The above address-related objects may be considered to be
         particularly sensitive and/or private.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should assign a base arc in the 'mib-2' (standards track) OID
   tree for the 'pmip6MIB' MODULE-IDENTITY defined in the PMIPv6 MIB.
