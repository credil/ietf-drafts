1. Introduction

   Layer 2 and 3 VPN services offer secure and logically dedicated
   connectivity among multiple sites for enterprises. VPN-oriented data
   center service is for those VPN customers who want to offload some
   dedicated user data center operations such as software, compute, and
   storage, to the shared carrier data centers.  Those customers often
   do not want to use public Internet as the primary network accessing
   and handling the traffic between the customer (user and user data
   centers) and the carrier data centers.  Instead, they would prefer to
   use the carrier data center as an nature extension of the VPN they
   are already using, realizing the benefits of a multi-tenant data
   center while retaining as much control as possible.  For example,
   they want to maintain the restrictive control on what and how the
   virtualized data center resources, e.g., computing power, disk
   spaces, and/or application licenses, can be shared.

   VPN-Oriented Data center Services allow the VPN services to be
   extended into carrier data centers and to control the virtual
   resources sharing functions. As a carrier, a VPN-Oriented data center
   service product may be offered globally across multiple data centers.
   Some of the data centers may be owned by the carrier, while others
   may be owned by a user/partner/vendor.  In addition, multiple VPN-
   oriented data center Service products can be offered from the same
   data center.

   VPN-Oriented data center services differentiate it from other carrier
   services in the following aspects:

     Strictly maintaining the secure, reliable, and logical isolation
     characteristics of VPN for the end-to-end services provided;
     Making the traditional data center services (like computing,
     storage space, or application licenses) as additional attributes to
     VPNs.
     VPN having the control on how and what data center resources to be
     associated with the VPN.
   This draft describes the characteristics of those services, the
   service requirements, and the corresponding requirements to data
   center networks. It also describes a list of the problems that this
   service is causing to the network provider/operator, especially for

   for service providers to facilitate the addition of virtualized
   services to the VPNs of existing customers.

   DC:      Data Center

   VM:     Virtual Machines

   VPN:     Virtual Private Network

3. Service definitions and requirements

3.1 VPN-oriented data center computing service

   This refers to Virtual Machines (VMs) and/or physical servers in a
   virtualized carrier data center being attached to a customer VPN. The
   customer can choose different properties on the computing power, such
   as dedicated servers, preference on which data center to host those
   servers, or special VMs which are shared with a group of other VPN
   customers, and etc.

3.1.1 VPN-oriented data center computing services requirements

  These requirements apply to all VPN-oriented data center services
described in this draft unless specified otherwise.

         Any virtualized carrier data center providing the VPN-oriented
         computing services SHOULD be able to automatically provision
         and/or change the required resources based on the specified
         properties associated with a VPN.

         VPN customers SHALL be able to automatically instantiate or
         remove Virtual Machines (VMs) to/from the VPN's associated
         hosts or dedicated servers through the changing of the
         customer's VPN properties.

         VPN customers SHOULD be able to move VMs among customer private
         data centers and carrier data centers based on their own load
         balancing criteria and algorithm.

Internet-Draft       VPN-oriented Cloud Services            March 2011


         VPN customers SHALL be able to monitor, log, and track all VM
         usage information on per user, per resource pool, and per
         application basis.

         VPN customers and the service provider SHALL be able to
         monitor, log, and track all VM user information.

         VPN customers SHALL be able to automatically add/remove
         physical servers associated with the VPN through the changing
         of the customer's VPN properties.

         VPN customers SHOULD be able to provision a new VPN and new
         service based on the properties associated with an existing VPN
         and service using the same set (or sub set) of existing
         physical infrastructure.

         VPN customers SHALL be able to control if and how VM mobility
         can occur.

3.2  VPN-oriented data center storage service
     This refers to disk space, either virtual or actual blocks of hard
     drives in data centers, being added to a customer's VPN.

3.2.1 VPN-oriented data center storage service requirements

         The VPN customer SHOULD be able to choose different content
          replication properties.  For example, the customer can control
          if the content has to be replicated locally or has to be
          replicated at a geographically different location
          (identifiable by the customer if needed); if the storage has
          to be co-located with certain VMs/hosts; or which VMs/hosts
          have access to the content, and etc.

         These storage properties SHOULD be associated with the VPN. Any
          data center providing the storage space for a VPN SHOULD be
          able to automatically provision or change the required storage
          space based on the properties associated with the VPN.

         The VPN customer SHOULD be able to automatically add disc space
          or remove disc space to the VPN's associated storage through
          the changing of the VPN properties.

         The VPN customer SHALL have the ability to limit the mobility
          of the stored data based on the VPN's reachability.

         The VPN customer SHOULD have the ability to specify the stored
          content life cycle management properties.  Those properties
          include but not limited to how long the stored content shall
          be stored and how it should be erased/deleted.



4. Requirements of Data Center networks in support of VPN-Oriented Data
   center Services

   The success of VPN services in the enterprise and the government
   world is largely due to its ability to virtually segregate the
   customer traffic at layer 2 and layer 3. The lower the layer that
   segregation can be maintained, the safer it is for the customers from
   security and privacy perspectives. Today's Data Centers use VLANs to
   segregate servers and traffic from different customers. Since each
   customer usually needs multiple service zones to place different
   applications, each customer usually needs multiple VLANs. Even small
   data centers today can have thousands of VLANs.  Therefore, pure VLAN
   segregation is not enough for large data centers. In addition, since
   carrier data center resources can be viewed as added attributes to
   VPNs, traffic segregation per VPN becomes an essential requirement to
   VPN-oriented data center services because of its ability to control
   the data center virtual resources' assignments, thus ensuring end-to-
   end resource allocation for service level performance insurance as
   well as manageability.

4.1 Requirement for extending VPNs into data center networks using VPN
gateways:

   When a data center does not use L2VPN or L3VPN as the intra-data
   center network, but still wants to provide the VPN-oriented data
   center services for external VPN customers, a VPN gateway function
   can be added to the data center networks to extend the external VPNs
   into the data center networks and to connect with the VMs and virtual
   storages.  (None L2/3 data center network technology used can include
   TRILL, PBB, SPB, OpenFlow, STP, and etc.) The VPN gateway function
   has to meet the following requirements:

        o Each external VPN SHALL be given a unique Identification (ID),
          and the traffic separation within the data center SHALL be
          maintained per ID.
        o Each data center Service associated with a VPN SHALL be
          transmitted over an unique set of intra-data center network
          connections (logical or physical).
        o The VPN gateway SHOULD maintain a record and the mapping of
          virtual and physical data center resources to physical/logical
          connections associated with each specific VPN running the VPN-
          oriented data center services.
        o The VPN gateway SHOULD be able to control the traffic flow and
          assign the dedicated virtual resources accordingly.
        o The carrier and the customer SHALL be able to monitor the
          resource assignment and usage per VPN per service.
        o The customer SHOULD be able to dynamically re-configure the
          data center resources assignment and allocation per services
          and/or per VM through the re-configuration of its VPN
          properties.
        o VPN gateway SHALL support multiple services per VPN.
        o VPN gateway SHOULD have the capability to differentiate QoS
          within the VPN on per service basis.  For example, storage
          service may have higher QoS requirement than computing
          service.
        o VPN gateway SHOULD support multiple external VPN instances and
          SHOULD be able to map them to the associated services.
        o  VPN gateway SHALL maintain the reportable record of how
          traffic separation per VPN is achieved through the data center
          network.

        o VPN Gateway SHOULD be able to allocated intra-data center
          network resources according to external VPN network's
          requirements dynamically for bandwidth, QoS and traffic
          engineering purpose.

4.2 Requirement for extending VPNs into data center networks using
intra-data center VPN

   When a L2/3 VPN is used as the network technology inside the data
   center, each external VPN SHALL be mapped to a unique internal VPN.

5. Data Center Resource Management Requirements for VPN-oriented Data
   center Services

   Today, data center server resources are managed by data center
   servers' administrators or management systems, and supported by
   hypervisors on the servers. This process is invisible to the
   underlying networks. The data center management functions include
   managing servers, instantiating hosts to VMs, managing disk space,
   and etc.

   Traffic loading and balancing and QoS assignments for data center
   networks are not considered by Data Center's server administration
   systems. Therefore, there is an interworking gap between the networks
   and the Data Center's server administration systems.  This gap needs
   to be filled in order for the VPN-oriented data center service to
   operate.

     The resources in data center MUST be partitioned per VPN instead
      of per customer.
     The data center service orchestration system SHALL have the
      ability to dedicate a specific block of disk space per services
      per VPN. The dedicated block of disk space CAN be maintained
      permanently or temporarily per VPN requirement, controlled by the
      associated properties of VPN.
     The carrier and the VPN customer SHALL be able to monitor the
      dedicated block of disk space per VPN per services.
     If a VPN specifies its associated storage space to be accessible
      only by certain hosts, the VPN customer SHALL have the ability to
      indicate the mechanism used to prevent the unwanted data retrieval
      for the block of disk space after it is no longer used by the VPN,
      before it can be re-used by other parties.
     The VPN SHALL have the ability to request dedicated network
      resources within the data center such as bandwidth and QoS
      settings.
     The VPN SHALL have the ability to hold the requested resources
      without sharing with any other parties.
     The external VPN's QoS assignments SHOULD be able to synchronize
      with the data center virtual resources' QoS assignments.





So                      Expires Sept30, 2011                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       VPN-oriented Cloud Services            March 2011


6. Security Requirements

       VPN-Oriented Data center Service SHOULD support a variety of
        security measures in securing tenancy of virtual resources such
        as resource locking, containment, authentication, access
        control, encryption, integrity measure, and etc.
       The VPN-Oriented Data center Service SHOULD allow the security
        to be configured end-to-end on a per-VPN/per-service/per-user
        basis. For example, the Data center Systems SHOULD be able to
        resource-lock resources such as memory, and also SHOULD be able
        provide a cleaning function to insure confidentiality before
        being reallocated.
       VPN-Oriented Data center Service SHOULD be able to specify an
        authentication mechanism based for both header and payload.
        Encryption algorithm CAN also be specified to provide additional
        security.
       Security boundaries CAN be specified and created per VPN to
        maintain domains of TRUSTED, UNTRUSTED, and Hybrid. Within each
        domain access control, additional techniques MAY be specified to
        secure resources and administrative domains.


7. Other Requirements

       The VPN-Oriented Data center Service SHALL support automatic
        end-to-end network configuration.
       The VPN-Oriented data center service solution MUST have
        sufficient OAM mechanisms in place to allow consistent end-to-
        end management of the solution in existing deployed networks.
        The solution SHOULD use existing protocols (e.g., IEEE 802.1ag,
        ITU-T Y.1731, BFD) wherever possible to facilitate
        interoperability with existing OAM deployments.


8. VPN-oriented Data center Service Framework

   VPN-oriented data center services do not alter the physical
   connectivity of the service supporting infrastructure. Instead, the
   framework augments the VPN associated properties on the carrier's VPN
   PE router.  In addition, it provides a generic interworking framework
   between the VPN and the data center network, exposing the IP/MAC
   address of the VMs directly to the VPN.


So                      Expires Sept30, 2011                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       VPN-oriented Cloud Services            March 2011


   The VPN-oriented data center services are flexible on the identities
   of service end points, covering all VPN use cases in existence today.
   It can be point-to-point and/or multi-point-to-multi-point, and
   everything in between.  The service can be between carrier data
   center and enterprise private data center, or between carrier data
   center and a remote VPN user.

   Below are three framework diagrams illustrating L3VPN-oriented data
   center services.  The frameworks for L2VPN-oriented data center
   services would be very similar to the ones shown here, using MAC
   addresses instead of IP addresses.

   Figure 1 shows an exemplary framework where 4 unique VPNs (customer
   LAN) accessing a carrier multi-tenant data center.

   Figure 2 shows the logical view of the framework from the vantage
   point of the data center PE router.

   Figure 3 shows the logical view of the service from the vantage point
   of the individual VM and/or VPN customer.  Please note that
