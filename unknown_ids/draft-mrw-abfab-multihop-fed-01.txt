Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for establishing trust across a
   multihop federation within the Application Bridging for Federation
   Beyond the Web (ABFAB) framework.

   This document introduces a new entity, the Trust Router.  Trust
   Routers exchange information about the availability of Trust Paths
   across a multihop federation.  They can be queried by a Relying Party
   to obtain the best Trust Path to reach an Identity Provider.  They
   also provide temporary identities that can be used by a Relying Party
   to traverse a Trust Path.

Internet-Draft         ABFAB Multihop Federations              July 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a mechanism for establishing trust across a
   multihop federation within the Application Bridging for Federation
   Beyond the Web (ABFAB) framework [I-D.lear-abfab-arch].

   This document introduces a new ABFAB entity, the Trust Router.  Trust
   Routers exchange information about the availability of Trust Paths
   across a multihop federation.  ABFAB entity, the Trust Router.  These
   paths are used by RPs to contruct transitive trust chains across a
   federation to a Radius or Diameter server within a target IdP.

   A Trust Path consists of one or more Trust Links.  A Trust Link is an
   assertion that a specific Trust Router is capable of providing
   temporary identies that can be used to access another entity in the
   ABFAB system.  At this point, we anticipate that there will be two
   types of Trust Links in ABFAB: a Trust Link that indicates that one
   Trust Router can be used to reach another Trust Router, and a Trust
   Link that indicates that a Trust Router can be used to reach a Radius
   or Diameter Server.  The first type (Trust Router Links) are shown as
   A->B(T), which indicates that the Trust Router in realm A can create
   identities to reach the trust router in Realm B. The second type
   (Radius/Diameter Links) are shown as A->B(R), to indicate that a
   trust router in Realm A can be used to reach a Radius, RadSec or
   Diameter server in Realm B.

   Trust Routers exchange information about available Trust Links within
   a federation, and each Trust Router maintains a tree of available
   paths to reach all of the IdPs within the federation that can be
   reached from the local realm of the Trust Router.

   When an RP receives a request from a party within a realm that not
   known directly to the RP, the RP will query its local Trust Router to
   obtain the best Trust Path to reach that IdP.  Note that we use the
   term 'best' here to highlight that there may well be multiple paths
   to reach an IdP from a given RP, and the selection of the 'best' path
   may involve several factors in addition to the length of the path,
   such as security and privacy practices, or monetary costs.

   The RP will travers the Trust Path obtained from it's local Trust
   Router.  At each step, the RP will request a temporary identity to
   access the next step in the Trust Path, contructing a transitive
   chain of trust to a Radius or Diameter server within the target IdP.

   To summarize, the Trust Router performs three functions:

   o  Trust Routers peer with other Trust Routers to exchange
      information about available Trust Links, and Trust Paths.  This

Internet-Draft         ABFAB Multihop Federations              July 2011


      information is exchanged between Trust Routers using the Trust
      Router Protocol.  The Trust Router Protocol is described in more
      detail in Section 5.

   o  Trust Routers respond to queries from Relying Parties to make
      information about Trust Paths available.  This exchange is
      referred to as a Trust Path Query Protocol, which is described in
      Section 6.

   o  To follow the Trust Path across a federation, the RP will use KNP
      to ask each Trust Router along the path to provision a temporary
      identity that can be used to gain access to the next step in the
      path.  This mechanism is called a Temporary Identity Request,
      which is described in Section 7.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document introduces the following terms:

   Trust Router:

      This is a logical ABFAB entity that exchanges information about
      Trust Paths that Relying Parties can use to create transtitive
      chains of trust across multihop ABFAB federations.

   Trust Link:

      A Trust Link is an assertion that a given Trust Router is capable
      of providing a temporary identity to communicate with another
      ABFAB entity (either another Trust Router, or a Radius/Diameter
      server within an IdP).

   Trust Path:

      A Trust Path is a concatenation of Trust Links that can be used by
      an RP to contruct a transitive trust chain across a federation to
      a target IdP.

   Trust Router Protocol:

      The Trust Router Protocol is the mechanism used by two Trust
      Routers to exchange information about Trust Links and Trust Paths.

   The terms Identity Provider (IdP), Relying Party (RP), Subject, and
   Federation are used as defined in [I-D.lear-abfab-arch].


3.  Motivation

   Figure 1 shows an example federation where the Relying Party Foo, has
   established relationships with various Identity Providers.



    +---------------+
    | Identity      |
    | Provider      | `..
    | Example-A.org |    `-._
    +---------------+        `..
                                `-._

    | Provider      | '                   |
    | Example-C.org |                    / \
    +---------------+                  Subject


                 Figure 1: One-to-many Federation Example

   When an RP receives a request to access a protected resource (or
   requires authentication and authorization for other purposes) the
   request includes a realm name that indicates the IdP the Subject has
   selected for this exchange.  Offering the Subject the ability to
   choose among many different IdPs is necessary because a Subject may
   have, and want to maintain, uncorrelated identities in several
   different realms within a single federation (i.e. work, school,
   social networking, etc.).  However, this also places a burden on the
   RPs to establish and maintain business agreements and exchange
   security credentials with a potentially large number of Identity
   Providers.

   In order for a single-hop federation to function, each IdP needs to
   maintain business agreements and exchange credentials with every RP
   that its Subjects are authorized to access.  Figure 2, shows the
   likely outcome, which is that a single-hop federation will come to

                     Figure 2: Mesh Federation Example

   As discussed in section 2.1.1 of [I-D.lear-abfab-arch], as the number
   of organizations involved in a ABFAB federation increase, static
   configuration may not scale sufficiently.  Also, using a Trust Broker
   to establish keys between entities near the RP and entities near the
   IDP with improve the security and privacy of an ABFAB federation.
   Figure 3 shows the structure of a federation where each IdP and RP
   has a single connection to the Trust Router infrastructure.

   To improve the operational scalability and security of large ABFAB
   federations, this document proposes a Trust Broker solution
   consisting of of a set of Trust Routers, as described in this
   document, and the Key Negotiation Protocol (KNP), as described in
   [I-D.howlett-radsec-knp].

   A multihop federation exchange matching the above diagram can be
   summarized as follows:

   1.  We start with a single federation including four realms, each
       containing a single Trust Router.  The Trust Routers are peered,
       such that their interconnections form a multihop federation.

   2.  A Subject (with an identity in Realm D) attempts to access a
       service provided by a Relying Party in Realm A.

   3.  The Relying Party does not have direct access to a Radius or
       Diameter server in Realm D that it can use to authenticate the
       Subject, so it asks its local Trust Router for a Trust Path to
       reach Realm D. The Trust Router in Realm A returns the path
       A->B(T)->C(T)->D(T)->D(R), which indicates that the Relying Party
       should use the Trust Routers in Realms B, C and D to reach a
       RADIUS or RADSEC server in Realm D, which could then be used to

Internet-Draft         ABFAB Multihop Federations              July 2011


       authenticate the Subject.

   4.  The Relying Party contacts a Trust Router in Realm B (using its
       permanent identity in Realm A), and requests the creation of a
       temporary identity that can be used to communicate with the Trust
       Router in Realm C.

   5.  The Relying Party then contacts the Trust Router in Realm C
       (using the temporary identity returned in the previous step), and
       asks for a temporary identity that can be used to communicate
       with the Trust Router in realm D.

   6.  The Relying Party then contacts the Trust Router in Realm D
       (using the temporary identity returned in the previous step), and
       asks the Trust Router to provision an identity that it can use to
       speak to the Radius or Diameter server in Realm D (which is part
       of Realm D's Identity Provider).

   7.  At this point, the Relying Party can reach the Subject's Identity
       provider, and the rest of the ABFAB exchange can continue, as
       described in [I-D.lear-abfab-arch].


5.  Trust Router Protocol

   Trust Routers use the Trust Router Protocol to exchange information
   about available Trust Links, and Trust Paths across a federation.

   The Trust Router Protocol differs from an Internet Routing Protocol
   in a couple of important ways:

   o  Trust Links are unidirectional.  It can not be assumed that the
      fact that a Trust Router in Realm A is authorized to create
      temporary identities to access a Trust Router in realm B, that the
      opposite is also true (A -> B(T) does not imply B->A(T)).

   o  Realm names are not necessarily hierarchical.  Although
      aggregation might be possible as a later optimization, the ability
      to aggregate realm names based on shared roots is not currently
      assumed.

   In addition to the existence of the links themselves, Trust Links
   have a set of associated attributes that can be used for filtering
   and tree computation, including:

   o  The cost of the link.

   o  Any security and privacy characteristics associated with the link.

   o  Information indicating how/if the link should be propagated across
      the federation.

   Current thinking is that we will use a BGP-based algorithm for
   computation of the local tree at each Trust Router, and that we will
   communicate a similar set of information between Trust Routers as
   would be communicated between Internet Routers running BGP.


6.  Trust Path Query

   A Trust Path Query is generated by a RP to request a Trust Path to
   reach a specific realm within a given Policy Regime.  If possible,
   the Trust Router will reply with a Trust Path that consists of zero
   or more Trust Router steps and ends with a Radius or Diameter server
   within the IdP for the indicated realm.

   The Trust Path Query is initiated by the RP, and the initial query
   message will contain the destination realm and Policy Regime.

   When a Trust Path Query is received by a Trust Router, the router
   will first authenticate the RP, and check local policy information to
   determine whether or not to reply.

   Assuming that the RP is successfully authenticated and the request
   passes local policy checks, the Trust Router will search it's tree of
   Trust Path information to determine whether a Trust Path exists that
   will reach the destination Realm within the indicated Policy Regime.
   If so, the shortest/best Trust Path will be returned to the Relying
   Party.

   A Trust Path will consist of a list of steps, each of which will
   contain: The type of the step (Trust Router or Radius/Diameter), the
   Policy Regime associated with each step, information needed to reach
   the indicated Trust Router or server (domain name or IP address), and
   any special attributes associated with that step.


7.  Temporary Identity Request

   A Temporary Identity Request is issued by a Relying Party in order to
   obtain an identity that can be used to traverse each step in the
   Trust Path.  When a Temporary Identity is requested, a Trust Router
   will provision a new identity in its local Radius or Diameter
   infrastructure that can be used by the Relying Party to communicate
   with the Trust Router or Radus/Diameter server that represents the

Internet-Draft         ABFAB Multihop Federations              July 2011


   next step in the Trust Path.  Current thinking is that KNP will be
   used as the protocol mechanism for these requests.

   These Temporary Identities will have a finite lifetime and, when
   authenticated, will include a Radius Attribute/Diameter AVP
   indicating that they were generated based on a Temporary Identity
   Request.  This attribute will inlcude the chain of identities that
   preceeded the current identity in the traversal of the Trust Path.

   The details of how these messages will be encoded has not yet been
   determined.  However, it is expected that, for each Trust Router step
   in the Trust Path, the following actions will take place:

   1.  The Relying Party will send a Temporary Identity Request message
       to the Trust Router, containing the identity of the next step in
       the Trust Path, the destination realm that it is trying to reach,
       and the Policy Regime in use.  This request will be sent using
       the identity that the Trust Router obtained from the previous
       step in the Trust Path (or the Trust Router's permanent identity
       in it's home realm, if this is the first step).

   2.  The Trust Router will authenticate the Relying Party.

   3.  If the authentication is successful, the Trust Router will check
       local policy to determine whether it should provision an identity
       for the Relying Party for the indicated purpose (details of this
       check may be implementation dependent).

   4.  If the request passes any policy requirements, the Trust Router
       will provision a temporary identity for the Relying Party within
       the Trust Router's local realm that can be used to access the
       next-hop Trust Router or RADIUS/RADSEC server in the Trust Path.


8.  Security Considerations

   As discussed in [I-D.lear-abfab-arch], the trust broker architecture
   is a mechanism for establishing technical trust in an ABFAB
   federation.  Technical trust mechanisms have three primary
   responsibilities in ABFAB.  They are responsible for integrity
   protection of AAA traffic.  They are responsible for constraining the
   naming of ABFAB entities: for example the technical trust mechanism
   assures that the entity claiming to be the IDP is authenticated and
   authorized to act as the IDP for the realm containing the subject.
   The technical trust mechanism also determines where AAA messages are
   routed.

   The trust broker architecture described in this document is designed

   to meet the security and operational requirements of federations and
   groups of federations with large numbers of organizations.  In these
   environments depending on any common credentials or trust mechanism
   does not make sense.  While federations are expected to interconnect,
   they are not expected to have a common set of trust anchors for a
   public-key infrastructure.  Each realm needs to be able to choose the
   appropriate credentials and security policies to use when
   establishing a relationship with another realm.

   by design, this approach provides flexibility.  Parts of the
   interconnected set of realms can use high-assurance processes and
   mechanisms including strong authentication mechanisms and rigorous
   credentialing and enrollment processes.  Other realms can use lower-
   assurance mechanisms and processes, balancing cost and speed against
   security.  However this flexibility complicates the security policy.
   Just because the local realm has a high-assurance trust link does not
   mean that the path is high-assurance.  Operational mechanisms are
   required in order for RPs to express their security requirements and
   for the trust routers to make sure that resulting trust paths meet
   these requirements.  Similarly, trust routers need to make sure that
   paths to a given IDP are not announced unless that IDP's security
   requirements will be met.

8.1.  Threat Model

   Like all Internet protocols, the trust router protocols and KNP need
   to have strong protection against parties who are not authorized to
   be part of an exchange.  Such attackers do not start out knowing
   credentials necessary to participate in the system.  However these
   attackers can be assumed to observe trust router, KNP, AAA and ABFAB
   exchanges.  The system needs to maintain integrity of all data,
   confidentiality of keys and in some cases confidentiality of other
   data even when these attackers can insert, suppress, modify or replay
   packets.  Reasonable defenses against attacks on the availability of
   the system are required, although obviously there are limits to these
   defenses.  An attacker who can disrupt connectivity with a realm can
   impact availability.

   The interesting threat model surrounds malicious participants
   authorized to participate in the system.  The threat model is similar
   to that of routing protocols [I-D.ietf-karp-threats-reqs].  Defending
   against a compromised actor announcing a trust link that actor would
   be permitted to announce were it functioning correctly is out of
   scope.  Similarly, defending against an compromised actor performing
   some action that actor is authorized to take is out of scope for this
   threat model.

   However, it is a requirement that the system needs to provide tools



Wasserman, et al.       Expires January 12, 2012               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         ABFAB Multihop Federations              July 2011


   to limit the authorization of actors.  For example if a particular
   session between two trust routers is not authorized to announce a
   trust link to a given realm or with certain properties, then attacks
   permitting such a link to be announced are in scope.  Similarly an
   attack permitting a temporary identity with properties inconsistent
   with administrative limits would be in scope.

   The system must permit zones of more or less trust to be created.  An
   attack that permits insiders in the zones of less trust to compromise
   a zone of higher trust beyond what the zone of lesser trust is
   permitted is within the scope of threats.  However, trust can only
   decrease as distance across the transitive network of trust routers
   increases.  A peer two hops away cannot be permitted to make any
   statement that a peer one hop away cannot make.  In general, it is
   unknown whether the peer two hops away actually made the statement.
