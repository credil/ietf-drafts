      Generalized Label for Super-Channel Assignment on Flexible Grid
              draft-hussain-ccamp-super-channel-label-00.txt


Abstract

   To enable scaling of existing transport systems to ultra high data
   rates of 1 Tbps and beyond, next generation systems providing super-
   channel switching capability are currently being developed. To allow
   efficient allocation of optical spectral bandwidth for such high bit
   rate systems, International Telecommunication Union
   Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is extending the
   G.694.1 grid standard (termed "Fixed-Grid") to include flexible grid
   (termed "Flex-Grid") support. This necessitates definition of new
   label format for the Flex-Grid. This document defines a super-
   channel label as a Super-Channel Identifier and an associated list
   of contiguous or non-contiguous set of 12.5 GHz slices representing
   optical spectrum of the super-channel. The label information can be
   encoded using a fixed length or variable length format. This label
   format can be used in GMPLS signaling and routing protocol to
   establish super-channel based optical label switched paths (LSPs).

   modulation formats and flexible channel spectrum bandwidth
   allocation schemes have become pivotal for future spectral efficient
   transport network architectures [1,2].

   A super-channel represents an ultra high aggregate capacity channel
   containing multiple carriers which are co-routed through the network
   as a single entity from the source transceiver to the sink
   transceiver [3]. By multiplexing multiple carriers, modulating each
   carrier with multi-level advanced modulation formats (such as PM-
   QPSK, PM-8QAM, PM-16QAM), allocating an appropriate-sized flexible
   channel spectral bandwidth slot, and using a coherent receiver for
   detecting closely packed sub-carriers, a super-channel can support
   ultra high data rates in a spectrally efficient manner while
   maintaining required system reach. Figure 1 contrasts channel
   spectrum bandwidth allocation schemes for various bit rate optical
   paths on fixed-grid (G.694.1) and flex-grid. ITU-T fixed-grid
   permits allocation of channel spectrum bandwidth in "single" fixed-
   sized slots (e.g., 50GHz, 100GHz etc) independent of the channel bit
   rate. In contrast, a flex-grid can allocate "arbitrary" size channel
   spectral bandwidth as an integer multiple of 12.5 GHz fine
   granularity contiguous slices depending on channel bit rate. This
   means, a flex-grid can support multiple data rates channels (optical
   paths) in a spectrally efficient manner as it allocates appropriate-
   sized spectrum bandwidth slots, as opposed to fixed-sized slots.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

3. Motivation for Super-Channel Label

   [RFC3471] defines new forms of MPLS "label" for the optical domain
   that are collectively referred to as a "generalized label".
   [RFC6205] defines a standard wavelength label based on ITU-T fixed-
   grids ([G.694.1] and [G.694.2]) for use by Lambda-Switch-Capable
   (LSC) LSRs.

   A new label format for super-channels assignment on flex-grid is
   needed because the existing label formats (such as the waveband
   switching label defined in RFC3471 and the wavelength label defined
   in RFC6205) either lack necessary fields to carry required flex-grid
   related information (e.g., channel spacing) or do not allow
   signaling of arbitrary flexible-size optical spectral bandwidth in
   an efficient manner (e.g., in terms of integer multiple of fine
   granularity 12.5GHz slices). For example,

   o  Waveband switching label format (defined in section 3.3.1 of
      RFC3471) lacks fields to carry necessary information to support
      flex-grid.

   o  Wavelength label allows signaling of single fixed-size optical
      spectrum bandwidth slot only.

   o  Wavelength label does not allow signaling of arbitrary flexible-
      size optical spectrum bandwidth needed for super-channels
      assignment on flex-grid.

3.1. Flex-Grid Slice Numbering

   Figure 2 (a) shows a 50 GHz ITU-T G.694.1 grid based on nominal
   central frequency (193.1 THz). In G.694.1, given a channel spacing
   (C.S) value and a value "n", the desired wavelength frequency can
   calculated as follows:

   Frequency (THz) = 193.1 THz + n * channel spacing (THz).

Internet-Draft     Generalized Super-Channel Label            July 2011


   Where "n" is a two's-complement integer (i.e., positive, negative,
   or 0) and "channel spacing" can be 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, or 0.1 THz.

   Figure 2 (b) shows a 12.5 GHz flex-grid with its nominal central
   frequency (193.1 THz) aligned with ITU-T G.694.1 nominal central
   frequency and with each 12.5 GHz slice represented by the "left-
   edge". Given the left edge frequency of a slice, one can calculate
   the value of n i.e., slice number as follows:

   Frequency (THz) = 193.1 THz + n * channel spacing (THz).

   Where "n" is a two's-complement integer (i.e., positive, negative,
   or 0) and "channel spacing" can be 0.0125 THz in this case. For
   example, slice number 0 is denoted by its left-edge frequency i.e.,
   f= 193.1 THz, slice number 1 is represented by its left edge
   frequency of 193.1125 THz (193.1 THz + 0.0125 THz) and so on.

3.2. Super-Channel Label

   In order to setup an optical path manual or dynamically, we need a
   way to identify and reserve resources (i.e., signal optical spectral
   bandwidth for the super-channel) along the optical path. For this
   purpose, this document defines a super-channel label as consisting
   of a Super-Channel Identifier and an associated list of contiguous
   or non-contiguous set of 12.5 GHz slices representing arbitrary size
   optical spectrum of the super-channel (Note: in the future, slice
   granularity could be 6.25 GHz).

      This field represents a logical identifier for a super-channel.
      To disambiguate waveband switching and super-channel label
      applications, we propose to rename the Waveband Identifier (32-
      bit) as a super-channel Identifier (16-bit).

      Grid: 3 bits

      This field indicates the Grid type. The value for Grid should be
      set to xx (to be assigned by IANA) for the ITU-T flex-grid based
      on ongoing [G.694.1] standard flex-grid extensions.

      n_start of Grid: 16-bit

         This field indicates the first slice number in Grid for the
      band being referenced (i.e., the start of the or the left most
      edge of the Grid).

      Num of Slices in Grid: 16-bit

         This field represents the total number of slices in the band.
      The value in this field determines the number of 32-bitmap words
      required for the grid.

      Bit map (Word): 32-bit

         Each bit in the 32-bitmap word represents a particular slice
         with a value of 1 or 0 to indicate whether for that slice
         reservation is required (1) or not (0). Bit position zero in
         the first word represents the first slice in the band (Grid)
         and corresponds to the value indicated in the "n_start of
         Grid" field.



   o  Option B: Encode super-channel label as a list of start and end
      slice numbers corresponding to N groups of contiguous slices with
      each group denoted  by its starting and ending slice number
      (e.g., "n_start_1" and "n_end_1" represent contiguous slices in
      group#1, "n_start 2" and "n_end 2" in group#2, ..., "n_start N"
      and "n_end N" in group#N).

      Number of Entries: 16-bit

         This field represents the number of 32-bit entries in the
      super-channel label (i.e., number of groups with contiguous
      slices). For example, in the case of a super-channel with
      contiguous optical spectrum, this field should have a value of 1
      (indicating one group of contiguous slices).

      n_start_i (i=1,2,...N): 16 bits

      n_end_i (i=1,2,...N): 16 bits

      A super-channel with contiguous or non-contiguous optical
      spectrum can be represented by N groups of slices where two
      adjacent groups can be contiguous or non-contiguous however each
      group contains contiguous slices. Each group is denoted by
      n_start_i (which indicates the lowest or starting 12.5 GHz slice
      number of the group) and n_end_i (which indicates the highest or
      ending 12.5 GHz slice number of the group). "n_start_i" and
      "n_end_i" are two's-complement integer that can take either a
      positive, negative, or zero value.

   Both options allow efficient encoding of super-channel label with
   contiguous and non-contiguous slices. Option A yields a fixed length
   format while option B a variable length format. Option A is
   relatively simpler, more flexible, however, might be less compact
   than option B for encoding super-channel with contiguous optical
   spectrum. In contrast, option B provides a very compact
   representation for super-channels with contiguous optical spectrum,
   however, might be less flexible in encoding super-channels with
   arbitrary non-contiguous set of slices.

   <Add any security considerations>

5. IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to assign a new Grid field value to represent ITU-T Flex-
   Grid.

Appendix A.                 Super-Channel Label Format Example

   Suppose node A and Node Z are super-channel switching capable and
   node A receives a request for establishing a 1 Tbps optical LSP from
   itself to node Z. Assume the super-channel requires a "contiguous"
   spectral bandwidth of 200 GHz with left-edge frequency of 191.475
   THz for the left-most 12.5 GHz slice and left-edge frequency of
   191.6625 THz for the right-most slice. This means n_start = (191.475
   - 193.1)/0.0125 = -130 and n_end = (191.6625 - 193.1)/0.0125 = -115
   (i.e. we need 16 slices of 12.5 GHz starting from slice number -130
   and ending at slice number -115).

   Node A signals the LSP via a Path message including a super-channel
   label format encoding option B defined in section 3.3:

   0                   1                   2                   3
