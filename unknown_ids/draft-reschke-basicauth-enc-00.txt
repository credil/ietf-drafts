          An Encoding Parameter for HTTP Basic Authentication
                     draft-reschke-basicauth-enc-00

Abstract

   The "Basic" authentication scheme defined in RFC 2617 does not
   properly define how to treat non-ASCII characters.  This has lead to
   a situation where user agent implementations disagree, and servers
   make different assumptions based on the locales they are running in.
   There is little interoperability for characters in the ISO-8859-1
   character set, and even less interoperability for any characters
   beyond that.

   This document defines a backwards-compatible extension to "Basic",
   specifying the server's character encoding expectation, using a new
   authentication scheme parameter.

Internet-Draft        Basic Auth Encoding Parameter          August 2010


1.  Introduction

   The "Basic" authentication scheme defined in Section 2 of [RFC2617]
   does not properly define how to treat non-ASCII characters
   ([USASCII]): it uses the Base64 [RFC4648] encoding of the
   concatenation of username, separator character, and password without
   stating which character encoding to use.

   This has lead to a situation where user agent implementations
   disagree, and servers make different assumptions based on the locales
   they are running in.  There is little interoperability for characters
   in the ISO-8859-1 character set ([ISO-8859-1]), and even less
   interoperability for any characters beyond that.

   This document defines a backwards-compatible extension to "Basic",
   specifying the server's character encoding expection, using a new
   auth-param as defined in Section 1.2 of [RFC2617].

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  The 'encoding' auth-param

   Servers MAY use the "encoding" authentication parameter to express
   the character encoding they expect the user agent to use. [[case-
   sens: Are parameter names case-sensitive?]] [[also-cred: Should this
   also work as a parameter on the credentials?  See Appendix B.3.]]

   The only allowed value is "UTF-8", to be matched case-insensitively
   (see [RFC2978], Section 2.3), indicating that the server expects the
   UTF-8 character encoding to be used ([RFC3629]).

   Other values are reserved for future use.

4.  Examples

   In the example below, the server prompts for authentication in the
   "foo" realm, using Basic authentication, with a preference for the
   UTF-8 character encoding:

   WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="foo", encoding="UTF-8"

   Note that the parameter value can be either a token or a quoted
   string; in this case the server chose to use the quoted-string
   notation.

Internet-Draft        Basic Auth Encoding Parameter          August 2010


   The user's name is "test", and his password is the string "123"
   followed by the Unicode character U+00A3 (POUND SIGN).  Following
   Section 1.2 of [RFC2617], but using the character encoding UTF-8, the
   user-pass, converted to a sequence of octets, is:

    't' 'e' 's' 't' ':' '1' '2' '3' pound
    74  65  73  74  3A  31  32  33  C2  A3

   Encoding this octet sequence in Base64 ([RFC4648]) yields:

     dGVzdDoxMjPCow==

   Thus the Authorization header field would be:

     Authorization: Basic dGVzdDoxMjPCow==

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations
   beyond those defined for the "Basic" authentication scheme
   ([RFC2617], Section 4), and those applicable to the handling of UTF-8
   ([RFC3629], Section 10).

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA Considerations related to this specification.

7.  Acknowledgements

   The internationalisation problem has been reported as a Mozilla bug
   back in the year 2000 (see
   <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41489>).  It was Andrew
   Clover's idea to address it using a new auth-param.

Appendix A.  Deployment Considerations

A.1.  User Agents

   User agents which already default to UTF-8 do not need to be changed
   at all.  Other user agents can keep their default behavior, and
   switch to UTF-8 when seeing the new parameter.

   On the other hand, the strategy below may already improve the user-
   visible behavior today:

   o  In the first authentication request, choose the character encoding
      based on the user's credentials: if they do not need any
      characters outside the ISO-8859-1 character set, default to ISO-
      8859-1, otherwise use UTF-8.

   o  If the first attempt failed and the encoding used was ISO-8859-1,
      retry once with UTF-8 encoding instead.

A.2.  Origin Servers

   Origin servers that expect ISO-8859-1 encoding do not require any
   changes.  Other servers that already expect UTF-8 can add the new
   parameter without any risk of breaking existing user agents.
   [[testme: We may want to confirm this with test cases.]]

Appendix B.  FAQ (to be removed by RFC Editor before publication)

B.1.  Why not simply switch the default encoding to UTF-8?

   There are sites in use today that default to a locale encoding, such
   as ISO-8859-1, and expect user agents to use that encoding.  These
   sites will break if the user agent uses a different encoding, such as
   UTF-8.

B.2.  What about Digest?

   Although the solution proposed in this document may be applicable to
   "Digest" is well, any attempt to update this scheme may be an uphill
   battle hard to win.

B.3.  What about a parameter for the credentials?

   Defining a parameter on the credentials would make it easier for the
   server to find out what the client is sending.  As far as clients
   only send the credentials parameter when the server opted-in through
   the challenge, there should be no interop issue.

   This sounds like a nice-to-have, but doesn't seem to be really
   needed.  Feedback appreciated.
