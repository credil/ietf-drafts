Internet-Draft                 SIEVE-XMPP                   October 2007


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   The [NOTIFY] extension to the [SIEVE] mail filtering language is a
   framework for providing notifications by employing URIs to specify
   the notification mechanism.  This document defines how xmpp URIs (see
   [XMPP-URI]) are used to generate notifications via the Extensible
   Messaging and Presence Protocol (see [XMPP]), which is widely
   implemented in Jabber instant messaging technologies.

1.2.  Terminology

   This document inherits terminology from [NOTIFY], [SIEVE], and
   [XMPP].

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [TERMS].


2.  Definition

   The xmpp mechanism results in the sending of an XMPP message to
   notify a recipient about an email message.  The general XMPP syntax
   is as follows:

   o  The notification MUST be an XMPP <message/> stanza.
   o  The value of the XMPP 'type' attribute MUST be 'headline' or
      'normal'.
   o  The value of the XMPP 'from' attribute MUST be the XMPP address of
      the notification service.
   o  The XMPP <message/> stanza MAY include a <subject/> child element
      whose value is some configurable text indicating that the message
      is a Sieve notification.
   o  The notification SHOULD include a URL for the recipient to use as
      a hint in locating the message, encapsulated as the XML character
      data of a <url/> child element of an <x/> element qualified by the
      'jabber:x:oob' namespace as specified in [OOB].

   The recommended mapping of the Sieve notify action into XMPP syntax
   is described in the following sections.

2.1.  Notify parameter "method"

   The "method" parameter MUST be a URI that conforms to the xmpp URI
   scheme (as specified in [XMPP-URI]) and that identifies an XMPP



Saint-Andre & Melnikov    Expires April 3, 2008                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                 SIEVE-XMPP                   October 2007


   account associated with the email inbox.  The URI MAY include the
   resource identifier portion of an XMPP address but SHOULD NOT include
   an authority component, query component, or fragment identifier
   component.  The processing application MUST extract an XMPP address
   from the URI in accordance with the processing rules specified in
   [XMPP-URI].  The resulting XMPP address MUST be encapsulated in XMPP
   syntax as the value of the XMPP 'to' attribute.

2.2.  Notify tag ":from"

   The ":from" tag has no special meaning for this notification
   mechanism, and this specification puts no restriction on its use.  As
   noted, the value of the XMPP 'from' attribute specified in the XMPP
   notification message MUST be the XMPP address of the notification
   service itself.  The value of the ":from" tag MAY be transformed into
   XMPP syntax; if so, it SHOULD be encapsulated as the value of an XMPP
   [SHIM] header named "Reply-To".

2.3.  Notify tag ":options"

   The ":options" tag has no special meaning for this notification
   mechanism.  Any handling of this tag is the responsibility of an
   implementation.

2.4.  Notify tag ":importance"

   The ":importance" tag has no special meaning for this notification
   mechanism, and this specification puts no restriction on its use.
   The value of the ":importance" tag MAY be transformed into XMPP
   syntax (in addition to or instead of including in the default
   message); if so, it MUST be encapsulated as the value of an XMPP
   [SHIM] header named "Urgency", and the XML character of that header
   MUST be "high" if the value of the ":importance" tag is "1", "medium"
   if the value of the ":importance" tag is "2", or "low" if the value
   of the ":importance" tag is "3".

2.5.  Notify tag ":message"

   If included, the ":message" tag MUST be transformed into the XML
   character data of an XMPP <body/> element.  If not included, the rule
   specified in [NOTIFY] SHOULD be followed, as shown in the examples
   below.


3.  Examples

   In the following examples, the sender of the email has an address of
   <mailto:juliet@example.org>, the entity to be notified has an XMPP



Saint-Andre & Melnikov    Expires April 3, 2008                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                 SIEVE-XMPP                   October 2007


   address of romeo@example.com (resulting in an XMPP URI of
   <xmpp:romeo@example.com>), and the notification service has an XMPP
   address of notify.example.com (resulting in an XMPP URI of <xmpp:
   notify.example.com>).

   The following is a basic Sieve notify action with only a method:

     notify "xmpp:romeo@example.com"

   The resulting XMPP <message/> stanza might be as follows:

     <message from='notify.example.com'
              to='romeo@example.com'
              xml:lang='en'>
       <subject>A Sieve instant notification!</subject>
       <body>&lt;juliet@example.org&gt; Wherefore art thou?</body>
     </message>

   The following is a more advanced Sieve notify action with a method,
   importance, subject, and message, as well as a URL pointing to the
   message:

     notify :importance "1"
            :message "Contact Juliet immediately!"
            "xmpp:romeo@example.com?message;subject=SIEVE"

   The resulting XMPP <message/> stanza might be as follows:

     <message from='notify.example.com'
              to='romeo@example.com'
              xml:lang='en'>
       <subject>SIEVE</subject>
       <body>Contact Juliet immediately!</body>
       <headers xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/shim'>
         <header name='Urgency'>high</header>
       </headers>
       <x xmlns='jabber:x:oob'>
         <url>
           imap://romeo@example.com/INBOX;UIDVALIDITY=385759045/;UID=20
         </url>
       </x>
     </message>


4.  Requirements Conformance

   Section 3.8 of [NOTIFY] specifies a set of requirements for Sieve
   notification methods.  The conformance of the xmpp notification



Saint-Andre & Melnikov    Expires April 3, 2008                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 SIEVE-XMPP                   October 2007


   mechanism is provided here.

   1.  An implementation of the xmpp notification method SHOULD NOT
       modify the final notification text (e.g., to limit the length);
       however, a given deployment MAY do so (e.g., if recipients pay
       per character or byte for XMPP messages).  Modification of
       characters themselves should not be necessary, since XMPP
       character data is encoded in [UTF-8].
   2.  An implementation MAY ignore parameters specified in the ":from",
       ":importance", and ":options" tags.
   3.  There is no recommended default message for an implementation to
       include if the ":message" argument is not specified.
   4.  A notification sent via the xmpp notification method MAY include
       a timestamp in the textual message.
   5.  The value of the XMPP 'from' attribute MUST be the XMPP address
       of the xmpp notification service.  The value of the Sieve ":from"
       tag MAY be transformed into the value of an XMPP [SHIM] header
       named "Reply-To".
   6.  An implementation MUST NOT include any other extraneous
       information not specified in parameters to the notify action.
   7.  In accordance with [XMPP-URI], an implementation MUST ignore any
       URI action or parameter it does not understand (i.e., the URI
       MUST be processed as if the action or parameter were not
       present).  It is RECOMMENDED to support the XMPP "message" query
       type (see [QUERIES]) and the associated "body" and "subject"
       parameters, which parameters SHOULD be mapped to the XMPP <body/>
       and <subject/> child elements of the XMPP <message/> stanza type,
       respectively.  However, if included then the Sieve notify
       ":message" parameter MUST be mapped to the XMPP <body/> element,
       overriding the "body" parameter (if any) included in the XMPP
       URI.
   8.  In response to a notify_method_capability test for the "online"
       notification-capability, an implementation SHOULD return a value
       of "yes" if it has knowledge of an active presence session for
       the specified notification-uri and a value of "no" if it does not
       have such knowledge.
   9.  An implementation SHOULD NOT attempt to retry delivery of a
       notification if it receives an XMPP error of type "auth" or
       "cancel", MAY attempt to retry delivery if it receives an XMPP
       error of type "wait", and MAY attempt to retry delivery if it
       receives an XMPP error of "modify" but only if it makes
       appropriate modifications to the notification (see [XMPP]); in
       any case the number of retries SHOULD be limited to a
       configurable number no less than 3 and no more than 10.  An
       implementation MAY throttle notifications if the number of
       notifications within a given time period becomes excessive
       according to local service policy.  Duplicate suppression (if
       any) is a matter of implementation and is not specified herein.

Internet-Draft                 SIEVE-XMPP                   October 2007


5.  Internationalization Considerations

   Although an XMPP address may contain nearly any [UNICODE] character,
   the value of the "method" parameter MUST be a Uniform Resource
   Identifier (see [URI]) rather than an Internationalized Resource
   Identifier (see [IRI]).  The rules specified in [XMPP-URI] MUST be
   followed when generating XMPP URIs.

   In accordance with Section 13 of RFC 3920, all data sent over XMPP
   MUST be encoded in [UTF-8].


6.  Security Considerations

   Depending on the information included, sending a notification can be
   comparable to forwarding mail to the notification recipient.  Care
   must be taken when forwarding mail automatically, to ensure that
   confidential information is not sent into an insecure environment.
   In particular, implementations MUST conform to the security
   considerations given in [NOTIFY], [SIEVE], and [XMPP].


7.  IANA Considerations

   The following template provides the IANA registration of the Sieve
   notification mechanism specified in this document:

     To: iana@iana.org
     Subject: Registration of new Sieve notification mechanism
     Mechanism name: xmpp
