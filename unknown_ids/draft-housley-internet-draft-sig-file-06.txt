INTERNET DRAFT    Digital Signatures on Internet-Drafts        June 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the conventions for storing a digital
   signature on Internet-Drafts.  The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
   [CMS] is used to create a detached signature.  The signature is
   stored in a separate companion file so that no existing utilities are
   impacted by the addition of the digital signature.

   At the time the IETF Secretariat posts the Internet-Draft in the
   repository, the digital signature is generated and posted as a
   companion file in the same repository.  The digital signature allows
   anyone to confirm that the contents of the Internet-Draft have not
   been altered since the time that the document was posted in the
   repository.

   The signature of the IETF Secretariat is intended to provide a
   straightforward way for anyone to determine whether a particular file
   contains the document that was made available by the IETF
   Secretariat.  The signing-time included by the IETF Secretariat
   provides the wall clock time; it is not intended to provide a trusted
   timestamp.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [STDWORDS].

1.2.  ASN.1

   The CMS uses Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [X.680].  ASN.1 is
   a formal notation used for describing data protocols, regardless of
   the programming language used by the implementation.  Encoding rules
   describe how the values defined in ASN.1 will be represented for
   transmission.  The Basic Encoding Rules (BER) [X.690] are the most
   widely employed rule set, but they offer more than one way to
   represent data structures.  For example, definite length encoding and
   indefinite length encoding are supported.  This flexibility is not
   desirable when digital signatures are used.  As a result, the
   Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690] were invented.  DER is a
   subset of BER that ensures a single way to represent a given value.
   For example, DER always employs definite length encoding.

2.  Internet-Draft Signature File

   All Internet-Draft file names begin with "draft-".  The next portion
   of the file name depends on the source of the document.  For example,
   documents from IETF working groups will have "ietf-" followed by the



Housley                                                         [Page 2]

INTERNET DRAFT    Digital Signatures on Internet-Drafts        June 2008


   working group abbreviation, and this is followed by a string that
   helps people figure out the subject of the document.

   All Internet-Draft file names end with a hyphen followed by a two
   digit version number and a suffix.  The suffix indicates the type of
   file.  A plain text file with a suffix of ".txt" is required.  Other
   formats may also be provided, and they employ the appropriate suffix
   for the file format.

   The companion signature file has exactly the same file name as the
   Internet-Draft, except that ".p7s" is added to the end.  This file
   name suffix conforms to the conventions in [MSG].  Here are a few
   example names:

      Internet-Draft: draft-ietf-example-widgets-03.txt
      Signature File: draft-ietf-example-widgets-03.txt.p7s

      Internet-Draft: draft-ietf-example-widgets-03.ps
      Signature File: draft-ietf-example-widgets-03.ps.p7s

      Internet-Draft: draft-housley-internet-draft-sig-file-00.txt
      Signature File: draft-housley-internet-draft-sig-file-00.txt.p7s

   The IETF Secretariat will post the signature file in the repository
   at the same time that the Internet-Draft is posted.

2.1.  Need for Canonicalization of Text Files

   In general, the content of the Internet-Draft is treated like a
   single octet string for the generation of the digital signature.
   Unfortunately, the plain text file requires canonicalization to avoid
   signature validation problems.  The primary concern is the manner in
   which different operating systems indicate the end of a line of text.
   Some systems use a single new-line character, other systems use the
   combination of the carriage-return character followed by a line-feed
   character, and other systems use fixed-length records padded with
   space characters.  For the digital signature to validate properly, a
   single convention must be employed.

2.2.  Text File Canonicalization

   The canonicalization procedure follows the conventions used for text
   files in the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) [FTP].  Such files must be
   supported by FTP implementations, so code reuse seems likely.

   The canonicalization procedure converts the data from its internal
   character representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII
   representation (see TELNET [TELNET]).  In accordance with the NVT



Housley                                                         [Page 3]

INTERNET DRAFT    Digital Signatures on Internet-Drafts        June 2008


   standard, the <CRLF> sequence MUST be used to denote the end of a
   line of text.  Using the standard NVT-ASCII representation means that
   data MUST be interpreted as 8-bit bytes.

   Trailing space characters MUST NOT appear on a line of text.  That
   is, the space character must not be followed by the <CRLF> sequence.
   Thus, a blank line is represented solely by the <CRLF> sequence.

   The form-feed nonprintable character (0x0C) is expected in Internet-
   Drafts.  Other nonprintable characters, such as tab and backspace,
   are not expected, but they do occur.  For robustness, any
   nonprintable characters (ones outside the range 0x20 to 0x7E) MUST
   NOT be changed in any way not covered by the rules for end-of-line
   handling in the previous paragraph.

   Trailing blank lines MUST NOT appear at the end of the file.  That
   is, the file must not end with multiple consecutive <CRLF> sequences.

   Any end-of-file marker used by an operating system is not considered
   to be part of the file content.  When present, such end-of-file
   markers MUST NOT be processed by the digital signature algorithm.

   Note: This text file canonicalization procedure is consistent with
   the ASCII NVT Definition offered in Appendix B of RFC 5198 [UFNI].

2.3.  Canonicalization of Other File Formats

   No canonicalization is needed for file formats other than plain text
   files.  Other file formats are treated as a simple sequence of octets
   by the digital signature algorithm.

3.  CMS Profile

   CMS is used to construct the detached signature of the Internet-
   Draft.  The CMS ContentInfo content type MUST always be present, and
   it MUST encapsulate the CMS SignedData content type.  Since a
   detached signature is being created, the CMS SignedData content type
   MUST NOT encapsulate the Internet-Draft.  The CMS detached signature
   is summarized by:

      ContentInfo {
        contentType          id-signedData, -- (1.2.840.113549.1.7.2)
        content              SignedData
      }







Housley                                                         [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT    Digital Signatures on Internet-Drafts        June 2008


      SignedData {
        version              CMSVersion, -- Always set to 3
        digestAlgorithms     DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers,
        encapContentInfo     EncapsulatedContentInfo,
        certificates         CertificateSet, -- Secretariat certificate(s)
        crls                 CertificateRevocationLists, -- Optional
        signerInfos          SET OF SignerInfo -- Only one signer
      }

      SignerInfo {
        version              CMSVersion, -- Always set to 3
        sid                  SignerIdentifier,
        digestAlgorithm      DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
        signedAttrs          SignedAttributes, -- Always present
        signatureAlgorithm   SignatureAlgorithmIdentifier,
        signature            SignatureValue,
        unsignedAttrs        UnsignedAttributes -- Optional
      }

      EncapsulatedContentInfo {
        eContentType         id-ct-asciiTextWithCRLF,
                                         -- (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.27)
        eContent             OCTET STRING  -- Always absent
      }

3.1.  ContentInfo

   The CMS requires the outer-most encapsulation to be ContentInfo
   [CMS].  The fields of ContentInfo are used as follows:

      contentType
         indicates the type of the associated content, and for the
         detached Internet-Draft signature file, the encapsulated type
         is always SignedData, so the id-signedData
         (1.2.840.113549.1.7.2) object identifier MUST be present in
         this field.

      content
         holds the content, and for the detached Internet-Draft
         signature file, the content is always a SignedData content.

3.2.  SignedData

   The SignedData content type [CMS] contains the signature of the
   Internet-Draft and information to aid in the validation of that






Housley                                                         [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT    Digital Signatures on Internet-Drafts        June 2008


   signature.  The fields of SignedData are used as follows:

      version
         is the syntax version number, and for this specification, the
         version number MUST be set to 3.

      digestAlgorithms
         is a collection of one-way hash function identifiers.  It MUST
         contain the identifier used by the IETF Secretariat to generate
         the digital signature.  See the discussion of digestAlgorithm
         in Section 3.2.1.

      encapContentInfo
         is the signed content, including a content type identifier.
         Since a detached signature is being created, it does not
         encapsulate the Internet-Draft.  The use of the
         EncapsulatedContentInfo type is discussed further in Section
         3.2.2.

      certificates
         is an optional collection of certificates.  It SHOULD include
         the X.509 certificate needed to validate the digital signature
         value.  Certification Authority (CA) certificates and end
         entity certificates MUST conform to the certificate profile
         specified in [PKIX1].

      crls
         is an optional collection of certificate revocation lists
         (CRLs).  It SHOULD NOT include any CRLs; however, any CRLs that
         are present MUST conform to the CRL profile specified in
         [PKIX1].

      signerInfos
         is a collection of per-signer information, and for this
         specification, each item in the collection must represent the
         IETF Secretariat.  More than one SignerInfo MAY appear to
         facilitate transitions between keys or algorithms.  The use of
         the SignerInfo type is discussed further in Section 3.2.1.

3.2.1.  SignerInfo

   The IETF Secretariat is represented in the SignerInfo type.  The
   fields of SignerInfo are used as follows:

      version
         is the syntax version number.  In this specification, the
         version MUST be set to 3.

      sid
         identifies the IETF Secretariat's public key.  In this
         specification, the subjectKeyIdentifier alternative is always
         used, which identifies the public key directly.  This
         identifier MUST match the value included in the
         subjectKeyIdentifier certificate extension in the IETF
         Secretariat's X.509 certificate.

      digestAlgorithm
         identifies the one-way hash function, and any associated
         parameters, used by the IETF Secretariat to generate the
         digital signature.

      signedAttrs
         is an optional set of attributes that are signed along with the
         content.  The signedAttrs are optional in the CMS, but
         signedAttrs is required by this specification.  The SET OF
         Attribute must be encoded with the distinguished encoding rules
         (DER) [X.690].  Section 3.2.3 of this document lists the signed
         attributes that MUST be included in the collection.  Other
         signed attributes MAY also be included.

      signatureAlgorithm
         identifies the digital signature algorithm, and any associated
         parameters, used by the IETF Secretariat to  generate the
         digital signature.

      signature
         is the digital signature value generated by the IETF
         Secretariat.

      unsignedAttrs
         is an optional set of attributes that are not signed.  Unsigned
         attributes are usually omitted; however, the unsigned
         attributes MAY hold a trusted timestamp generated in accordance
         with [TSP].  Section 2.2.4 of [TSP] provides more information
         about this unsigned attribute.

3.2.2.  EncapsulatedContentInfo

   The EncapsulatedContentInfo structure contains a content type
   identifier.  Since a detached signature is being created, it does not
   encapsulate the Internet-Draft.  The fields of
   EncapsulatedContentInfo are used as follows:

      eContentType
         is an object identifier that uniquely specifies the content
         type.  The content type associated with the plain text file



Housley                                                         [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT    Digital Signatures on Internet-Drafts        June 2008


         MUST be id-ct-asciiTextWithCRLF.  Other file formats may also
         be posted, and the appropriate content type for each format is
         discussed in Section 4.  Additional file formats can be added
         if the Internet community chooses.

      eContent
         is optional.  When an encapsulated signature is generated, the
         content to be signed is carried in this field.  Since a
         detached signature is being created, eContent MUST be absent.

3.2.3.  Signed Attributes

   The IETF Secretariat MUST digitally sign a collection of attributes
   along with the Internet-Draft.  Each attribute in the collection MUST
   be DER-encoded.  The syntax for attributes is defined in [X.501], and
   the X.500 Directory provides a rich attribute syntax.  A very simple
   subset of this syntax is used extensively in [CMS], where
   ATTRIBUTE.&Type and ATTRIBUTE.&id are the only parts of the ATTRIBUTE
   class that are employed.

   Each of the attributes used with this CMS profile has a single
   attribute value.  Even though the syntax is defined as a SET OF
   AttributeValue, there MUST be exactly one instance of AttributeValue
   present.

   The SignedAttributes syntax within signerInfo is defined as a SET OF
   Attribute.  The SignedAttributes MUST include only one instance of
   any particular attribute.

   The IETF Secretariat MUST include the content-type, message-digest,
   and signing-time attributes.  The IETF Secretariat MAY also include
   the binary-signing-time signed attribute as well as any other
   attribute that is deemed appropriate.  The intent is to allow
   additional signed attributes to be included if a future need is
   identified.  This does not cause an interoperability concern because
   unrecognized signed attributes are ignored at verification.

3.2.3.1.  Content-Type Attribute

   A content-type attribute is required to contain the same object
   identifier as the content type contained in the
   EncapsulatedContentInfo.  The appropriate content type for each
   format is discussed in Section 4.  The IETF Secretariat MUST include
   a content-type attribute containing the appropriate content type.
   Section 11.1 of [CMS] defines the content-type attribute.






Housley                                                         [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT    Digital Signatures on Internet-Drafts        June 2008


3.2.3.2.  Message-Digest Attribute

   The IETF Secretariat MUST include a message-digest attribute, having
   as its value the output of a one-way hash function computed on the
   Internet-Draft that is being signed.  Section 11.2 of [CMS] defines
   the message-digest attribute.

3.2.3.3.  Signing-Time Attribute

   The IETF Secretariat MUST include signing-time attribute, specifying
   the time, based on the local system clock, at which the digital
   signature was applied to the Internet-Draft.  Section 11.3 of [CMS]
   defines the content-type attribute.

3.2.3.4.  Binary-Signing-Time Attribute

   The IETF Secretariat MAY include a binary-signing-time attribute,
   specifying the time at which the digital signature was applied to the
   Internet-Draft.  If present, the time that is represented MUST match
   the time represented in the signing-time attribute.  The binary-
   signing-time attribute is defined in [BinTime].

3.2.4.  Unsigned Attributes

   Unsigned attributes are usually omitted.  However, an unsigned
   attribute MAY hold a trusted timestamp generated in accordance with
   [TSP].  The idea is to time-stamp the IETF Secretariat digital
   signature to prove that it was created before a given time.  If the
   IETF Secretariat's certificate is revoked the time stamp allows a
   verifier to know whether the signature was created before or after
   the revocation date.  Appendix A of [TSP] defines the signature time-
   stamp attribute that can be used to time-stamp a digital signature.

4.  Content Types

   This section lists the content types that are used in this
   specification.  The eContentType field as described in Section 3.2.2
   contains a content type identifier, and the same value appears in the
   content-type attribute as described in Section 3.2.3.1.

      Extensible Markup Language (XML)   id-ct-xml
      Portable Document Format (PDF)     id-ct-pdf

      id-ct-xml  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::= { id-ct 28 }

      id-ct-pdf  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::= { id-ct 29 }

      id-ct-postscript  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::= { id-ct 30 }

5.  Security Considerations

   The IETF Secretariat MUST protect its private key.  The use of a
   hardware security module is RECOMMENDED because compromise of the
   IETF Secretariat's private key permits masquerade.

   The generation of a public/private key pair for signature operations
   relies on random number generation.  The use of an inadequate pseudo-
   random number generator (PRNG) can result in little or no security.
   An attacker may find it much easier to reproduce the PRNG environment
   that produced the key pair, searching the resulting small set of
   possibilities, rather than brute force searching the whole private
   key space.  The generation of quality random numbers is difficult,
   but [RANDOM] offers important guidance in this area.

   The IETF Secretariat should be aware that cryptographic algorithms
   become weaker with time.  As new cryptoanalysis techniques are
   developed and computing performance improves, the work factor to
   break a particular digital signature algorithm or one-way hash
   function will be reduced.  Therefore, it SHOULD be possible to
   migrate these algorithms.  That is, the IETF Secretariat SHOULD be
   prepared for the supported algorithms to change over time.

   The IETF Secretariat must take care to use the correct time in

   signing-time and binary-signing-time attributes.  The inclusion of a
   compatible date within the Internet-Draft by the authors and the
   signing time attributes by the IETF Secretariat provides confidence
   about the date that the Internet-Draft was posted to the repository.

6.  Deployment and Operational Considerations

   The private key used to generate the IETF Secretariat signature ought
   to be stored in a hardware security module to provide protection from
   unauthorized disclosure.  While the hardware security module will be
   operated by the IETF Secretariat, it ought to be owned by the IETF
   Trust.  Accordingly, the Trustees of the IETF Trust will designate an
   appropriate certification authority to issue a certificate to the
   IETF Secretariat, and they will approve any procedures used by the
   IETF Secretariat for signing documents consistent with this
   specification.

7.  Design Rationale

   A detached signature is used for all file formats.  Some file
   formats, such as PDF and XML, have file-format-specific ways of
   handling digital signatures.  These file-format-specific approaches
   are not used for two reasons.  First, a single way to sign Internet-
   Drafts will ease implementation by the IETF Secretariat.  Second, if
   the author includes a signature using one of these file-format-
   specific approaches, the Secretariat signature does not harm it in
   any way.

   File names are the means linking the detached signature to the signed
   document.  A CMS signed attribute could have been specified to
   include another form of linkage, and this could be added in the
   future.  At this point in time, it is important to support signature
   validation of expired Internet-Drafts that are obtained from non-IETF
   repositories.  Therefore, the appropriate value for such a signed
   attribute is unclear.  This specification allows an Internet-Draft
   and companion signature file to be stored anywhere without hindering
   signature validation.

Appendix: A

   OpenSSL 0.9.9 [OpenSSL] includes an implementation of CMS.  The
   following command line can be used to verify an Internet-Draft
   signature:

      openssl cms -verify -CAfile <cert-file> -content <internet-draft> /
           -inform DER -in <p7s-file> -out /dev/null

   The arguments need to be provided as follows:

      <cert-file>
         the name of the file containing the trust anchor, which is
         typically the self-signed certificate of the certification
         authority that issued a certificate to the IETF Secretariat.

      <internet-draft>
         the name of the file containing the signed Internet-Draft.

      <p7s-file>
         the name of the file containing the detached signature that was
         generated in accordance with this specification.
