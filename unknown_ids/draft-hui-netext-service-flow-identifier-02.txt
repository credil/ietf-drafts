Abstract

   This document proposes extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 that allows
   service flow identification and binding, and PMIP tunnels will be set
   up based on the service flow granularity. Therefore, multiple service
   flows of the mobile node can be separately controlled, e.g. QoS,
   charging, traffic control, and provides the precondition of flow
   mobility among multiple interfaces of the mobile node.

Internet-Draft         Service Flow identifier             March, 2010



1. Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network based local mobility management
   protocol which binds the home network prefix(es) assigned to a given
   interface of a mobile node to its current care-of address (Proxy-CoA).
   The mobile access gateway performs the proxy binding update with the
   local mobility anchor and does the mobility management on behalf of
   the mobile node attached to the network. Details of protocol
   operation and related terminologies are given in RFC 5213 [1].

   PMIPv6 is based on the MIPv6 [2] that is a host based global mobility
   management protocol. It reuses the home agent functionality and the
   message formats used in mobility signaling of MIPv6. In draft-ietf-
   mext-flow-binding [3], MIPv6 is extended to allow the binding of a
   particular flow to a care-of address without affecting other flows
   using the same home address. Therefore, each flow of the mobile
   node's multiple interfaces can be separately forwarded based on the
   flow identifier in the binding update.

   Current PMIPv6 protocol is host granularity basis. There is only one
   tunnel between a pair of LMA and MAG, so the network side cannot
   distinguish the different payload in the tunnel, and the operator
   can't do service control consequently. To enable the traffic control,
   charging and QoS control per service flow basis in PMIPv6 domain,
   PMIPv6 should be enhanced to achieve flow granularity control. To
   support the service flow proxy binding update operation, each service
   flow of the mobile node can be forwarded and controlled separately,
   which is mapped to one PMIPv6 tunnel, one BCE/BULE and one pair of
   GRE Keys.

   In this document, a new Service Flow Identifier option is defined to
   carry the service flow identifier and service flow attributes in the
   Proxy Binding Update and Acknowledgement message. Hence, the mobile
   access gateway can bind mobile node's each service flow to its home
   network prefix, respectively. Therefore, the mobile node's multiple
   service flows can be separately controlled based on the service flow
   identifier. E.g. charging and QoS control can be implemented per each
   service basis, as different charging criteria are applicable to the
   mobile node's different service flows.

              Figure 1  Service Flow (SF) Proxy Binding Update

   Figure 1 shows the signaling call flow using the PMIPv6 extension
   when the mobile node starts a new service flow.

   1. The bi-directional tunnel between the mobile access gateway and
      the local mobility anchor is set up for the mobile node, based on
      the standard attach procedure in PMIPv6, specified in RFC 5213 [1].

   2. When a new service flow of the mobile node is started (e.g. launch
      a new service), the data packet of this service will be routed to
      the mobile access gateway.

   3. The mobile access gateway analyzes the received data packet(this
      analysis mechanism can be achieved in several ways which is out of
      scope of this draft), catching the corresponding packet filter
      attributes, and generates a unique service flow identifier and the
      service flow description option for this service flow. Then it
      sends a Proxy Binding Update message to the mobile node's local
      mobility anchor for updating the service flow binding
      information  including the service flow identifier option and the
      assigned downlink GRE Key for this binding.

   4. Upon receiving the Proxy Binding Update message from the mobile
      access gateway, the local mobility anchor will first check the

      validity of the Proxy Binding Update message and assure the
      uniqueness of the SFID value. If the proxy binding update is
      accepted, it will return a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message
      including the service flow identifier option and the uplink GRE
      Key for this binding. It also creates the new binding cache entry
      that including home network prefix(es) of the mobile node, service
      flow identifier, packet filter attributes, and the assigned uplink
      and downlink GRE Key for this service flow binding. A new BCE/BULE
      and a new pair of GRE Keys are assigned for each service flow.

   5. The new bi-directional tunnel for this specific service flow
      between the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor is
      set up to forward the corresponding data packets.

   6. When the data packet of this service flow is routed to the mobile
      access gateway, it will check the binding update list and attain
      the uplink GRE Key. And then it encapsulates and forwards the data
      packet to the mobile node's local mobility anchor.

   Hence, multiple service flows of the mobile node can be separately
   controlled based on the service flow identifier in the service flow
   identifier option of the Proxy Binding Update message, e.g. different
   charging criteria can be adapted to mobile node's each service flow.

         Figure 4  A Use Case of Multiple Service Flows Binding

   Assume a mobile node establishes two service flows, called SF1 and
   SF2. This two service flows can belong to one interface or two
   different interfaces. The SF1 is peer-to-peer voice over IP traffic
   with its peers that mobile node's port number is 49724 and the peer's
   port is 56512. The SF2 is HTTP traffic with its peer that the peer's
   port is 80.

   When mobility access gateway receives the data packet of the mobile
   node's service flow, it will send the Proxy Binding Update message to
   the local mobility anchor with the service flow identifier option and
   assigned downlink GRE key for this service flow.

      O The service flow identifier option for SF1 included in the Proxy
      Binding Update message is set as follows:

        Service Flow Identifier field is SFID1=1 and PRO field is 0;

        The service flow description option included in the service flow
        identifier option is set as follows: Type field is set to 0,

        Source Port Range field is set to 49724, and Destination Port
        Range field is set to 56512.

      O The service flow identifier option for SF2 included in the Proxy
      Binding Update message is set as follows:

        Service Flow Identifier field is SFID2=2 and PRO field is 0;

        The service flow description option included in the service flow
        identifier option is set as follows: Type field is set to 0, and
        Destination Port Range field is set to 80.

   If the service flow proxy binding update is accepted, the local
   mobility anchor will return a Proxy Binding Acknowledge message with
   service flow identifier option and the assigned uplink GRE key, and
   the Status field is set to 0(success).

   If the mobile access gateway doesn't receive the data packet of the
   peer-to-peer voice over IP traffic from the mobile node for a long
   time, it will send the Proxy Binding Update message to the local
   mobility anchor again to delete this service flow binding.

      O The service flow identifier option included in the Proxy Binding
      Update message is set as follows: Service Flow Identifier field is
      set to 1, and PRO field is set to 2.

Internet-Draft         Service Flow identifier             March, 2010



5. Mobility Access Gateway Operation

5.1. Binding Update List extensions

   Service flow binding is conceptually stored in the binding update
   list entry of the mobile access gateway. To better implement the
   service flow based control, the original BULE should be extended to
   include the following parameters:

   O SFID (service flow identifier): A service flow identifier for the
   service flow of the mobile node MUST be unique within the LMA.

   O Packet filter attributes of the service flow that contained in the
   service flow description option.

5.2. Service Flow Proxy Binding Update Operation

   When a service flow of the mobile node is started or terminated, the
   mobile access gateway will analyze the received data packets,
   generate the unique service flow identifier, and trigger the service
   flow binding update mechanism. It then sends the Proxy Binding Update
   message containing a service flow identifier and the assigned
   downlink GRE key for this binding to the local mobility anchor. The
   service flow identifier option MUST indicate valid Service Flow
   Identifier, PRO, Service Flow Description option fields.

   When the mobile access gateway receives the proxy binding acknowledge
   containing the service flow identifier option from the local mobility
   anchor, the Status field of the service flow identifier indicates the
   status of the service flow binding on the local mobility anchor. If
   it is set to 0 to 127, it means that this service flow binding
   operation is accepted by the local mobility anchor, and the local
   mobility anchor will return the uplink GRE key for this service flow
   binding in the Proxy Binding Acknowledge message.

5.3. Data Forwarding Rules

   As the service flow binding operation is succeed, the mobile access
   gateway and local mobility anchor sets up the bi-directional tunnel,
   and assigns downlink and uplink GRE Key for this service flow binding.

   When the mobile access gateway receives a data packet from the mobile
   node, it MUST check that a service flow binding for the service flow
   that the data packet belongs to is created or not. If the bi-
   directional tunnel is set up, the mobile access gateway will

   encapsulate the data packet with the uplink GRE key, and then forward
   it to the mobile node's local mobility anchor.

   When the mobile access gateway receives a data packet from the bi-
   direction tunnel established with the local mobility anchor, it will
   decapsulate the data packet by removing the outer header, and attains
   the destination address of the inner packet. Then the mobile access
   gateway will forward it to the mobile node on the interface where the
   destination network prefix is hosted.

6. Local Mobility Anchor Operation

6.1. Binding Cache extensions

   Service flow binding is conceptually stored in the binding cache
   entry of the local mobility anchor.  To better implement the service
   flow based control, the original BCE should be extended to include
   the following parameters:

   O SFID (service flow identifier): A service flow identifier for the
   service flow of the mobile node MUST be unique within the LMA.

   O Packet filter attributes of the service flow that contained in the
   service flow description option.

6.2. Service Flow Proxy Binding Acknowledge Operation

   When the local mobility anchor receives the Proxy Binding Update
   message which includes the service flow identifier option, it first
   performs the operation described in section 5.3.1 of RFC 5213. If the
   proxy binding update is accepted, the local mobility anchor then
   checks the service flow identifier option.

   If the PRO field in the service flow identifier option is set to 0
   which indicates to add a new service flow binding, the local mobility
   anchor first checks the service flow identifier field that it MUST a
   value that does not already exist. Then the local mobility anchor
   checks the service flow description option following the service flow
   identifier option. If all of the checks above indicated a valid
   option, the local mobility anchor will return a Proxy Binding
   Acknowledge message with the Status field set to 0 and the uplink GRE
   key, and then add the service flow binding to its binding cache.

   If the PRO field in the service flow identifier option indicates to
   modify or delete an existent service flow binding, the local mobility
   anchor first checks the service flow identifier field that it needs
   to contain a value that already exists. Then the local mobility
   anchor will return a Proxy Binding Acknowledge message with the
   uplink GRE key and modify or delete the corresponding service flow
   binding in its binding cache.

6.3. Data Forwarding Considerations

   When the local mobility anchor receives a data packet from a
   correspondent node with the destination address matching a mobile

   node's home network prefix field, with the source address matching
   the destination address field, and other attributes matching of the
   corresponding fields in the binding cache entry, it MUST encapsulate
   it with the downlink GRE key of this service flow binding, and
   forward it to the mobile access gateway through the bi-directional
   tunnel.

   When the local mobility anchor receives a data packet from the bi-
   directional tunnel with the mobile access gateway, it MUST
   decapsulate the data packet by removing the outer header. Then it
   will forward the data packet to the destination address of the
   correspondent node in the inner header.

7. Security Considerations

   Since the service flow identifier option is part of the mobility
   option in the proxy binding update and acknowledge message, it uses
   the same security as the proxy binding update operation in RFC 5213.

8. IANA Considerations

   This specification defines two new mobility options as in section 2,
   the Service Flow Identifier Option and the Service Flow Description
   Option.
