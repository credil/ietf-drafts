Abstract

   This document describes a method includes generating an aggregated
   pseudowire status message on Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   network Label Switched Path (LSP). The method for transmitting the
   pseudowire (PW) status information is not new, however these protocol
   extension allows a Service Provider (SP) to reliably use the PW
   static status messages on individual PWs. The aggregated pseudowire
   status message configured to verify a current status of all
   pseudowires on the LSP.
