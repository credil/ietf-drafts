Internet-Draft          Atom Hierarchy Relations               June 2009


1.  Introduction

   Many applications, besides blogs, provide their data in the form of
   syndicated Web feeds using formats such as Atom [RFC4287].  Some such
   applications organize Atom Entries in a hierarchical fashion similar
   to a file system.

   This specification describes a means of communicating about Atom
   Entries that are hierarchically related to each other since resource
   identifiers are opaque to clients and cannot be directly manipulated
   for the purposes of representation exchange, i.e., navigation.

   This specification proposes new link relations for hierarchically
   related Atom resources.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses Atom link relations to identify different
   types of links; see the Atom specification [RFC4287] for information
   about their syntax, and the IANA link relation registry for more
   information about specific values.


2.  Hierarchy link relations

   A hierarchy exists when a resource indicates the likelihood of the
   existence of a parent and/or a child resource.  The terms parent and
   child are indicative of the need for the former to exist before the
   latter can be created.

2.1.  Modeling Hierarchy In Atom

   The Atom Syndication Format [RFC4287] defines the Atom Entry
   construct.  The extensions in this specification define two
   specialized kinds of Entry construct -- parent Entry and child Entry.

   A parent Entry is a container for child Entries.  A parent Entry
   could itself be a child of another parent Entry.

   Every Entry construct is represented as an Atom Entry Document
   [RFC4287] referred to in this specification as an "entry" and its
   plural.  A logical Feed comprising entirely of child entries of a

Internet-Draft          Atom Hierarchy Relations               June 2009


   given Entry is called its child feed and one comprising entirely of
   its parent entries is called its parent feed.  Both parent feed and
   child feed are seen from the perspective of a given Entry resource.
   The entries in the parent feed and child feed of an Entry SHOULD be
   disjoint, i.e., not share any entries.

   Applications MAY allow more than one parent Entry to contain a given
   child Entry.  This is similar to hard links in filesystems.  On the
   other hand, certain applications allow only a single parent Entry.

   A child Entry MAY use a logical Feed to represent multiple parent
   Entries.  Alternatively, a child Entry MAY use multiple "up" atom:
   link elements, each to identify one of the parent Entries.

2.2.  The "down" Link

   An Atom link element with a rel attribute value of "down" may be used
   to reference a resource where child entries of an entry may be found.
   If the attribute of the atom:link is omitted, its value is assumed to
   be "application/atom+xml".

   For example,

   <entry xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
     <title type="text">Hanky Panky Portfolio</title>
     <link rel="down" type="application/atom+xml;type=feed"
       href="/portfolios/1/positions/"/>
     <link rel="down" type="text/html"
       href="/portfolios/1;listing"/>
     ...
   </entry>

   Although Atom feed, entry, and source elements MAY each contain any
   number of atom:link elements using the "down" link relation, this
   specification assigns no significance to the presence or order of
   such links.  Multiple down links appearing within an atom:entry may
   reference alternative representations of the same set of children or
   may reference entirely distinct resources containing distinct sets of
   children.  Processors MUST NOT assume that multiple down links are
   referencing different representations of the same resource and MUST
   process each down link independently of any others.

2.3.  The "up" Link

   An Atom link element with a rel attribute value of "up" may be used
   to reference a resource where parent entries of an entry or a feed
   may be found.  If the attribute of the atom:link is omitted, its
   value is assumed to be "application/atom+xml".

   For example,

   <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
     <title type="text">Positions in Hanky Panky</title>
     <link rel="self"
       href="/portfoloios/1/positions/"/>
     <link rel="up"
       href="/portfolios/1"/>
     ...
   </feed>

   Although Atom feed, entry, and source elements MAY each contain any
   number of atom:link elements using the "up" link relation, this
   specification assigns no significance to the presence or order of
   such links.  Multiple up links appearing within an atom:entry may
   reference alternative representations of the same set of parents or
   may reference entirely distinct resources containing distinct sets of
   parents.  Processors MUST NOT assume that multiple up links are
   referencing different representations of the same resource and MUST
   process each up link independently of any others.


3.  Security Considerations

   Hierarchy Extensions for Atom is subject to the security
   considerations found in Section 8 of [RFC4287].


4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification uses the following relation that has been
   previously registered in the Link Relations Registry
   o  Attribute Value: up
   o  Description: A URI that refers to one or more parent resources in
      a hierarchy of resources.
   o  Expected display characteristics: none
   o  Security considerations: See this specification

   This specification defines the following new relations that have been
   added to the Link Relations registry:
   o  Attribute Value: down
   o  Description: A URI that refers to one or more child resources in a
      hierarchy of resources.
   o  Expected display characteristics: none
   o  Security considerations: See this specification
