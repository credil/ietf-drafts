       Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) Extensions
                   draft-forte-lost-extensions-00.txt

Abstract

   An important class of location-based services answer the question
   "What instances of this service are closest to me?"  Examples include
   finding restaurants, gas stations, stores, automated teller machines,
   wireless access points (hot spots) or parking spaces.  Currently, the
   Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol only supports mapping
   locations to a single service based on service regions.  This
   document describes an extension that allows queries of the type "N
   nearest", "within distance X" and "served by".

Internet-Draft               LoST Extensions                  March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol [RFC5222] maps
   service identifiers (URNs) and civic or geospatial information to
   service URIs, based on service regions.  While motivated by mapping
   locations to the public safety answering point (PSAP) serving that
   location, the protocol has been designed to generalize to other
   location mapping services.

   However, the current LoST query model assumes that each service URI
   has a service region and that service regions do not overlap.  This
   fits the emergency services model, where the service region of a PSAP
   is given by jurisdictional boundaries, but does not work as well for
   other services that do not have clearly defined boundaries.  For
   example, any given location is likely served by a number of different
   restaurants, depending on how far the prospective customer is willing
   to walk or drive.

   Generally speaking, we can divide location-based services into two
   main categories.

   Services based on:
   o  how far they are from the user (e.g., ATM machines, takeout)
   o  wether or not their service region includes the client's current
      location (e.g., pizza delivery, NG9-1-1)

   For services included in the first category service regions are not
   relevant while they are important for services included in the second
   category.

   We extend LoST with three additional queries, giving the protocol the
   ability to find the N nearest instances of a particular service, all
   services within a given radius and all services whose service region
   includes the client's current location.

   The LoST extensions defined in this document do not apply to
   emergency services.


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  New Query Types: "N nearest", "within distance X" and "served by"

   We introduce three new types of queries, "N nearest", "within
   distance X" and "served by".  The first query returns the N points of
   interest closest to the client's physical location, the second query
   discovers all those points of interest located within a given
   distance from the client's physical location, the third query returns
   all those points of interest whose service region includes the
   client's current location.


4.  LoST Extensions

   For queries "within distance X", the LoST client needs to specify to
   the server the range within which instances of a particular service
   should be searched.  In order to do this, we make use of various
   shapes [PIDF-LO] in LoST queries.

   For queries "served by", the LoST client needs to let the server know
   that it MUST return only those services whose service region includes
   the client's current location.  In order to do this we introduce the
   <region> element in <findService> queries.  Service region boundaries
   MAY be returned in a LoST <findServiceResponse> as described in
   [RFC5222].

   For queries "N nearest", the LoST client needs to let the server know
   N, that is, the maximum number of service URIs to be returned in a
   response.  In order to specify this, we introduce the <limit> element
   in <findService> queries.

   Also, we introduce a new element in LoST responses, namely
   <serviceLocation>.  This new element is used by the server to
   indicate to the client the physical location of points of interest.
   In doing so, the client can compute the distance and other metrics
   between its current location and the points of interest.

   The new elements <region>, <limit> and <findService> are defined in
   the "lostNe" namespace.  This new namespace is defined in Section 6.

4.1.  New Use of Shapes in Queries

   In [PIDF-LO] different shapes are defined in order to represent a
   point and an area of uncertainty within which the user might be
   situated.  While this remains true for "served by" queries, for
   "within distance X" queries such shapes represent the area within
   which we want to find a service.

   For example, Figure 1 shows a <findService> geodetic query using the

Internet-Draft               LoST Extensions                  March 2010


   circular shape.  In particular, with the query shown in Figure 1, we
   are asking the LoST server to send us a list of service URNs for
   pizza places within 200 meters from our approximate position
   specified in <p2:pos>.

   Aside from the circular shape, other shapes are also useful.  In
   particular, there are situations in which it is useful to query for
   services in a certain direction of movement rather than in an exact
   physical location.  For example, if a user is driving north from New
   York City to Boston, it would be useful for this user to be able to
   query for services north of where he currently is that is, not at his
   current physical location nor at his final destination.

   In order to do this, we use shapes such as an ellipse.  The ellipse
   has a major and a minor dimension thus allowing for defining a
   "priviledged" direction by having the major dimension in the
   direction of movement.  In the present context the circular shape
   allows a device to search for services in any direction sourrounding
   its physical location while shapes such as the ellipse allow the
   device to search for services in a more specific direction.  The
   ellipse shape is defined in [PIDF-LO].

4.2.  Queries Based on Service Areas

   As mentioned in Section 1, we can divide location-based services into
   two main categories.

Internet-Draft               LoST Extensions                  March 2010


   Services based on:
   o  how far they are from the user
   o  wether or not their service region includes the client's current
      location

   For services included in the first category a "within distance X"
   query MUST be used.  For services included in the second category a
   "served by" query MUST be used.

   When querying LoST regarding a specific service, we need to specify
   if such service belongs to either the first or the second category.
   This is necessary since depending on the category the service belongs
   to, the LoST server has to follow a different metric in selecting the
   results to include in the response.

   In order for the client to specify which of the two categories the
   service belongs to, we introduce the <region> element.  This new
   element is of type boolean.  When its value is true it means that the
   requested service belongs to the second category and a search based
   on service regions MUST be performed by the LoST server.  When either
   its value is false or the <region> element is missing, the LoST
   server MUST perform a search based on the distance between the user
   and the points of service.

   For a search based on service regions the LoST server MUST return
   only those services whose service region includes the client's
   current location.  Service region boundaries MAY be returned in a
   LoST <findServiceResponse> as described in [RFC5222].

   <region> element

4.3.  Difference Between "within distance X" and "served by" Queries

   Figures 1 and 2 show an example of a "within distance X" query and a
   "served by" query, respectively.  The two types of queries although
   very similar have three important differences.
   o  A "served by" query can support all the shapes a "within distance
      X" query can support plus the point shape which does not make
      sense for a "within distance X" query.
   o  In a "within distance X" query a shape represents the area within
      which to search for points of service.  In all other types of
      queries including a "served by" query, a shape represents an
      uncertainty in the location of the client.
   o  In a "within distance X" query the value of the <region> element,
      if present, MUST be false.  If such element is not present, its
      value MUST be assumed equal to false.  A "served by" query SHALL
      have the value of the <region> element always set to true.

4.4.  Limiting the Number of Returned Service URIs

   Limiting the number of results is helpful, particularly for mobile
   devices with limited bandwidth.  For "N nearest" queries, the client
   needs to be able to tell the server to return no more than N service
   URIs.  In order to specify such limit we introduce a new element,
   namely <limit>.  This new element is OPTIONAL but when present, it
   MUST be conveyed inside the <findService> element defined in
   [RFC5222].

   Figures 3, 4 and 5 show a <findService> geodetic query where the
   client asks the server to return no more than 20 service URIs.  In
   particular, Figure 3 shows a 'N nearest' query, Figure 4 shows a
   query which is a combination of 'N nearest' and 'within distance X'
   while Figure 5 shows a query which is a combination of 'N nearest'
   and 'served by'.  When receiving such queries, the LoST server will
   return a list of no more than 20 points of interest.

   If the available points of interest are more than N, then the server
   has to identify among the points of interest to return, the N points
   of interest closest to the client's physical location and MUST return
   those in the response.

   When the <limit> element is not present in a <findService> query then
   all available points of interest for the requested type of service
   SHALL be returned by the LoST server.

4.5.  The <serviceLocation> Element in Responses

   It is important for the LoST client to know the location of a point
   of interest so that distance, route and other metrics can be
   computed.  We introduce a new element, namely <serviceLocation>.  The
   <serviceLocation> element contains the geodetic coordinates of a
   point of service and SHOULD be used for all non-emergency services.
   When it is used, it MUST be contained in a <mapping> element.  In
   responses such as <findServiceResponse> [RFC5222], a list of service
   URIs, each with its own <serviceLocation> element, SHOULD be
   returned.  The order of service URIs in the list is not relevant.

   The <serviceLocation> element has one single attribute, 'profile', in
   order to specify the profile used.  Only geodetic profiles SHOULD be
   used as the computation of the distance, route and other metrics
   would at some point require geocoding of the civic address in
   geodetic coordinates.  Because of this, the position specified in
   <serviceLocation> SHOULD be represented by using the <Point> element.
   The <Point> element is described in Section 12.2 of [RFC5222] and in
   Section 5.2.1 of [PIDF-LO].  Figure 6 shows a <findServiceResponse>
   answer containing two location-to-service-URI mappings.

   [NOTE: The <locationUsed> element cannot be extended for this purpose

   as it is defined outside of the <mapping> element.  In particular, in
   a response the <locationUsed> element is always one, while the number
   of service URIs is typically more than one.]

   There are situations, however, in which it is helpful to include a
   civic address together with the geodetic coordinates of a point of
   service.  Usually, databases already contain the civic address of
   points of interest and for devices with limited capabilities it is
   not always possible to perform decoding of geocoordinates in order to
   determine the civic address.  Because of this, including also the
   civic address in a response can be useful.  In order to do this, it
   is RECOMMENDED to include the <civicAddress> element as defined in
   [RFC5139] in each <mapping> element.  Figure 6 shows a
   <findServiceResponse> answer with the <civicAddress> element.

   This section provides the Relax NG schema of LoST extensions in the
   compact form.  The verbose form is included in Section 9.


   namespace a = "http://relaxng.org/ns/compatibility/annotations/1.0"
   default namespace ns1 = "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lostNe"

   ##    Protocol

   ##
   ##    LoST Extensions define three new elements: limit, region and
   ##    serviceLocation.
   ##
   start =
     limit
     | region
     | serviceLocation

   ##
   ##    A limit to the number of returned results.
   ##
   div {
     limit=
       element limit {
         xsd:positiveInteger
       }
   }

   ##
   ##   A boolean variable to request a search
   ##   based on either service areas or distance.
   ##
   div {
     region=
       element region {
         xsd:boolean
       }
   }

   ##
   ##    Location Information
   ##
   div {
     locationInformation =
       extensionPoint+,
       attribute profile { xsd:NMTOKEN }?
   }

   ##
   ##    Location Information about the returned point
   ##    of service.
   ##
   div {
     serviceLocation=
       element serviceLocation { locationInformation }+
