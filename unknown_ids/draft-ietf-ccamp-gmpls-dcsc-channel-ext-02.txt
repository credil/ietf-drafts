Abstract

   This document describes two technology-independent extensions to
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching.  The first extension
   defines the new switching type Data Channel Switching Capable.  Data
   Channel Switching Capable interfaces are able to support switching of
   the whole digital channel presented on single channel interfaces.
   The second extension defines a new type of generalized label and
   updates related objects.  The new label is called the Generalized
   Channel_Set Label and allows more than one data plane label to be
   controlled as part of an LSP.

1. Introduction

   This document describes two technology independent extensions to
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS).  Both of these
   extensions were initially defined to in the context of Ethernet
   services, see [GMPLS-ESVCS] and [GMPLS-MEF-UNI], but are generic in
   nature and may be useful to any switching technology controlled via
   GMPLS.

   The first extension defines a new switching type, which is called
   Data Channel Switching Capable (DCSC).  DCSC interfaces are able to
   support switching of the whole digital channel presented on single
   channel interfaces.  The second extension defines a new type of
   generalized label and updates related objects.  The new label is
   called the Generalized Channel_Set Label and allows more than one
   data plane label to be controlled as part of an LSP.


1.1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. Data Channel Switching

   Current GMPLS switching types are defined in [RFC3945] and [RFC3471]
   and support switching at the packet (PSC), frame (L2SC), time-slot
   (TDM), frequency (LSC) and fiber (FSC) granularities.  One type of
   switching that is not well represented in this current set is
   switching that occurs when all data received on an ingress port is
   switched through a network to an egress port.  While there are
   similarities between this level of switching and the "opaque single
   wavelength" case described in Section 3.5 of [RFC4202], such port-to-
   port switching is not limited to the optical switching technology
   implied by the LSC type. FSC is also similar, but it is restricted to
   fiber ports and also supports multiple data channels with-in the
   fiber port.

   This document defines the new switching type called Data Channel
   Switching Capable (DCSC). Port switching seems a more intuitive name,
   but this naming collides with PSC so it isn't used.  DCSC interfaces
   are able to support switching of the whole digital channel presented
   on single channel interfaces.  Interfaces that inherently support
   multiple channels, e.g., WDM and channelized TDM interfaces, are
   specifically excluded from this type. Any interface that can be
   represented as a single digital channel are included.  Examples



Berger & Fedyk               Standards Track                    [Page 3]

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-dcsc-channel-ext-02.txt  October 14, 2009


   include concatenated TDM and line encoded interfaces.  Framed
   interfaces may also be included when they support switching on an
   interface granularity.

   DCSC is represented in GMPLS, see [RFC3471] and [RFC4202], using the
   value TBA (by IANA).

   Port labels, as defined in [RFC3471], SHOULD be used for LSPs
   signaled using the DCSC Switching Type.  The DCSC Switching Type may
   be used with the Generalized Label Request object, [RFC3473], or the
   Generalized Channel_Set LABEL_REQUEST Object defined below.


2.1. Compatibility

   Transit and egress nodes that do not support the DCSC Switching Type
   when receiving a Path message with a Label Request containing the
   DCSC Switching Type will behave in the same way nodes generally
   handle the case of an unsupported Switching Type.  Specifically, per
   [RFC3473], such nodes are required to generate a PathErr message,
   with a "Routing problem/Unsupported Encoding" indication.

   Ingress nodes initiating a Path message containing a Label Request
   containing the DCSC Switching Type, receiving such a PathErr
   messages, then notify the requesting application user as appropriate.


3. Generalized Channel_Set Label Related Formats

   This section defines a new type of generalized label and updates
   related objects.  This section updates the label related definitions
   of [RFC3473].  The ability to communicate more than one label as part
   of the same LSP was motivated by the support for the communication of
   one or more VLAN IDs. Simple concatenation of labels as is done in
   [RFC4606] was deemed impractical given the large number of VLAN IDs
   (up to 4096) that may need to be communicated.  The formats defined
   in this section are not technology specific and may be useful for
   other switching technologies.  The LABEL_SET object defined in
   [RFC3473] serves as the foundation for the defined formats.

3.1. Generalized Channel_Set LABEL_REQUEST Object

   The Generalized Channel_Set LABEL_REQUEST object is used to indicate
   that the Generalized Channel_Set LABEL Object is to be used with the
   associated LSP.  The format of the Generalized Channel_Set
   LABEL_REQUEST object is the same as the Generalized LABEL_REQUEST
   object and uses a C-Type of TBA.


3.2. Generalized Channel_Set LABEL Object

   The Generalized Channel_Set LABEL Object communicates one or more
   labels, all of which can be used equivalently in the data path
   associated with a single LSP.  The format of the Generalized
   Channel_Set LABEL Object is based on the LABEL_SET object defined in
   [RFC3473].  It differs from the the LABEL_SET object in that the full
   set may be represented in a single object rather than the multiple
   objects required by the [RFC3473] LABEL_SET object.  The object MUST
   be used on LSPs that use the Generalized Channel_Set LABEL_REQUEST
   object.  The object MUST be processed per [RFC3473].  Make-before-
   break procedures, see [RFC3209], SHOULD be used when modifying the
   Channel_Set LABEL object.

   The format of the Generalized Channel_Set LABEL object is:

   o  Generalized Channel_Set LABEL object: Class = 16, C-Type = TBA (By
   IANA)

   The Channel_Set Sub-Object size is measured in bytes and MUST always

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Action: 8 bits

         See [RFC3471] for definition of actions.  Range actions SHOULD
         be used when possible to minimize the size of the Channel_Set
         LABEL Object.

      Number of Subchannels: 10 bits

         Indicates the number of subchannels carried in the sub-object.
         When the number of subchannels required exceeds the limit of
         the field, i.e., 1024, multiple Channel_Set Sub-Objects MUST be
         used.  Note that the size of the sub-object may result in a
         Path message being larger than a single unfragmented IP packet.
         See section 4.4 for an example of how this case may be handled.

         A value of zero (0) has special meaning and MAY be used in
         either the LABEL or UPSTREAM_LABEL object.  A value of zero (0)
         is used in a LABEL or UPSTREAM_LABEL object to indicate that
         the subchannel(s) used in the corresponding (downstream or
         upstream) direction MUST match the subchannel(s) carried in the
         reverse directions label object. When value of zero (0) is
         used, no Subchannels are included in the Channel_Set Sub-Object
         and only one Channel_Set Sub-Object may be present.  The zero
         (0) value MUST NOT be used in both the LABEL and UPSTREAM_LABEL
         object of the same LSP.

      Label Type: 14 bits

         See [RFC3473] for a description of this field.

      Subchannel: Variable

         See [RFC3471] for a description of this field. Note that this
         field might not be 32 bit aligned.

      Padding: Variable

         Padding is used to ensure that the length of a Channel_Set Sub-
         Object meets the multiple of 4 byte size requirement stated
         above.  The field is only required when the Subchannel field is
         not 32 bit aligned and the number of included Subchannel fields
         result in the Sub-Object not being 32 bit aligned.

         The Padding field MUST be included when the number of bits
         represented in all the Subchannel fields included in a
         Generalized Channel_Set Sub-Object result in the Sub-Object not
         being 32 bit aligned.  When present, the Padding field MUST
         have a length that results in the Sub-Object being 32 bit
         aligned.  When present, the Padding field MUST be set to a zero
         (0) value on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.
         These bits SHOULD be passed through unmodified by transit
         nodes.


3.3. Other Label related Objects

   The previous section introduced a new LABEL object.  As such the
   formats of the other label related objects are also impacted.
   Processing of these objects is not modified and remains per their
   respective specifications.  The other label related objects are
   defined in [RFC3473] and include:
      - SUGGESTED_LABEL object
      - LABEL_SET object
      - ACCEPTABLE_LABEL_SET object
      - UPSTREAM_LABEL object
      - RECOVERY_LABEL object

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-dcsc-channel-ext-02.txt  October 14, 2009


3.4. Compatibility

   Transit and egress nodes that do not support the Generalized
   Channel_Set Label related formats will first receive a Path message
   containing Generalized Channel_Set LABEL_REQUEST object.  When such a
   node receives the Path message, per [RFC3209], it will send a PathErr
   with the error code "Unknown object C_Type".

   Ingress nodes initiating a Path message containing a Generalized
   Channel_Set LABEL_REQUEST object on receiving such a PathErr
   messages, then notify the requesting application user as appropriate.


4. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to administer assignment of new values for
   namespaces defined in this document and summarized in this section.


4.1. Data Channel Switching Type

   Upon approval of this document, IANA will make the assignment in the
   "Switching Types" section of the "GMPLS Signaling Parameters"
   registry located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/gmpls-sig-
   parameters:

   Value   Type                                      Reference
   -----   ---------------------------               ---------
     125*   Data Channel Switching Capable (DCSC) [This document]

   (*) Suggested value.

   It should be noted that the assigned value should be reflected in
   IANAGmplsSwitchingTypeTC at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/ianagmplstc-mib.


4.2. Generalized Channel_Set LABEL_REQUEST Object

   Upon approval of this document, IANA will make the assignment in the
   "Class Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types" section of the "RSVP
   PARAMETERS" registry located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-
   parameters.

   A new class type for the existing LABEL_REQUEST Object class number
   (19) with the following definition:

      Class Types or C-Types:

        5* Generalized Channel_Set                  [This document]

   (*) Suggested value.


4.3. Generalized Channel_Set LABEL Object

   Upon approval of this document, IANA will make the assignment in the
   "Class Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types" section of the "RSVP
   PARAMETERS" registry located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-
   parameters.

   A new class type for the existing RSVP_LABEL Object class number (16)
   with the following definition:

      Class Types or C-Types:

        4* Generalized Channel_Set                  [This document]

   (*) Suggested value.


5. Security Considerations

   This document introduces new message object formats for use in GMPLS
   signaling [RFC3473].  It does not introduce any new signaling
   messages, nor change the relationship between LSRs that are adjacent
   in the control plane. As such, this document introduces no additional
   security considerations.  See [RFC3473] for relevant security
   considerations.  Additionally, the existing framework for MPLS and
   GMPLS security is documented in [MPLS-SEC].
