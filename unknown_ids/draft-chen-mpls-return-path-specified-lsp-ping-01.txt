1. Introduction 

   This document defines extensions to the failure-detection protocol 
   for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) 
   known as "LSP Ping" [RFC4379] that can be used to specify the return 
   paths for the echo reply message, increasing the robustness of LSP 
   Ping, reducing the opportunity for error, and improving the 
   reliability of the echo reply message. A new reply mode, which is 
   referred to as "Reply via specified path", is added and a new Type-
   Length-Value (TLV), which is referred to as Reply Path (RP) TLV, is 
   defined in this memo. 

   With the extensions described in this document, a bidirectional LSP 
   and a pair of unidirectional LSPs (one for each direction) could 
   both be tested with a single operational action, hence providing 
   better control plane scalability. The defined extensions can also be 
   utilized for creating a single Bidirectional Forwarding Detection 
   (BFD) [BFD], [BFD-MPLS] session for a bidirectional LSP or for a 
   pair of unidirectional LSPs (one for each direction). 

   In this document, term bidirectional LSP includes the co-routed 
   bidirectional LSP defined in [RFC3945]and the associated 
   bidirectional LSP that is constructed from a pair of unidirectional 
   LSPs (one for each direction), and which are associated with one 
   another at the LSP's ingress/egress points [RFC5654]. 

2. Problem Statements and Solution Overview 

   MPLS LSP Ping is defined in [RFC4379]. It can be used to detect data 
   path failures in all MPLS LSPs, and was originally designed for 
   unidirectional LSPs. 

   LSP are increasingly being deployed to provide bidirectional 
   services. The co-routed bidirectional LSP is defined in [RFC3471] 
   and [RFC3473], and the associated bidirectional LSP is defined in 
   [RFC5654]. With the deployment of such services, operators have a 
   desire to test both directions of a bidirectional LSP in a single 
   operation. 

   Additionally, when testing a single direction of an LSP (either a 
   unidirectional LSP, or a single direction of a bidirectional LSP) 
   using LSP Ping, the validity of the result may be affected by the 
   success of delivering the echo response message. Failure to exchange 
   these messages between the egress Label Switching Router (LSR) and

   the ingress LSR can lead to false negatives where the LSP under test 
   is reported as "down" even though it is functioning correctly. 

2.1. Limitations of Existing Mechanisms for Bidirectional LSPs 

   With the existing LSP Ping mechanisms as defined in [RFC4379], 
   operators have to enable LSP detection on each of the two ends of a 
   bidirectional LSP independently. This not only doubles the workload 
   for the operators, but may also bring additional difficulties when 
   checking the backward direction of the LSP under the following 
   conditions: 

     1. The LSR that the operator logged on to perform the checking 
     operations might not have out-of-band connectivity to the LSR at 
     the far end of the LSP.  That can mean it is not possible to check 
     the return direction of a bidirectional LSP in a single operation 
     - the operator must log on to the LSR at the other end of the LSP 
     to test the return direction.  

     2. The LSP being tested might be an inter-domain/inter-AS LSP 
     where the operator of one domain/AS may have no right to log on to 
     the LSR at the other end of the LSP since this LSR resides in 
     another domain/AS. That can make it completely impossible for the 
     operator to check the return direction of a bidirectional LSP. 

   Associated bidirectional LSPs have the same issues as those listed 
   for co-routed bidirectional LSPs. 

   This document defines a mechanism to allow the operator to request 
   that both directions of a bidirectional LSP be tested by a single 
   LSP Ping message exchange. 

2.2. Limitations of Existing Mechanisms for Handling Unreliable Return 
      Paths 

   [RFC4379] defines 4 reply modes: 

         1. Do not reply 
         2. Reply via an IPv4/IPv6 UDP packet 
         3. Reply via an IPv4/IPv6 UDP packet with Router Alert 
         4. Reply via application level control channel. 
          
   Obviously, the issue of the reliability of the return path for an 
   echo reply message does not apply in the first of these cases. 


 
 
Chen, et al.           Expires April 26, 2010                 [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft     Return Path Specified LSP Ping         October 2009 
    

   [RFC4379] states that the third mode may be used when the IP return 
   path is deemed unreliable. This mode of operation requires that all 
   intermediate nodes must support the Router Alert option and must 
   understand and know how to forward MPLS echo replies. 

   This is a rigorous requirement in deployed IP/MPLS networks 
   especially since the return path may be through legacy IP-only 
   routers. Furthermore, for inter-domain LSPs, the use of the Router 
   Alert option may encounter significant issues at domain boundaries 
   where the option is usually stripped from all packets. Thus, the use 
   of this mode may itself introduce issues that lead to the echo reply 
   messages not being delivered. 

   And in any case, the use modes 2 or 3 cannot guarantee the delivery 
   of echo responses through an IP network that is fundamentally 
   unreliable. The failure to deliver echo response messages can lead 
   to false negatives making it appear that the LSP has failed. 

   Allowing the ingress LSR to control the path used for echo reply 
   messages, and in particular forcing those messages to use an LSP 
   rather than being sent through the IP network, enables an operator 
   to apply an extra level of deterministic process to the LSP Ping 
   test. 

   This document defines extensions to LSP Ping that can be used to 
   specify the return paths of the echo reply message in an LSP echo 
   request message. 

3. Extensions  

   LSP Ping defined in [RFC4379] is carried out by sending an echo 
   request message. It carries the Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) 
   information of the tested LSP which indicates which MPLS path is 
   being verified, along the same data path as other normal data 
   packets belonging to the FEC. 

   LSP Ping [RFC4379] defines four reply modes that are used to direct 
   the egress LSR in how to send back an echo reply. This document 
   defines a new reply mode, the Reply Via Specified Path mode. This 
   new mode is used to direct the egress LSR of the tested LSP to send 
   the echo reply message back along the path specified in the echo 
   request message. 

   In addition, a new TLV, the Reply Path (RP) TLV, is defined in this 
   document. The RP TLV consists of one or more sub-TLVs that can be

Internet-Draft     Return Path Specified LSP Ping         October 2009 
    

   used to carry the specified return path information to be used by 
   the echo reply message. 

3.1. Reply Via Specified Path mode 

   A new reply mode is defined to be carried in the Reply Mode field of 
   the LSP Ping echo request message. 

   The recommended value of the Reply Via Specified Path mode is 5 
   (This is to be confirmed by the IANA). 

         Value    Meaning 
         -----    ------- 
             5     Reply via specified path 
            
   The Reply Via Specified Path mode is used to notify the remote LSR 
   receiving the LSP Ping echo request message to send back the echo 
   reply message along the specified paths carried in the Reply Path 
   TLV. 

3.2. Reply Path (RP) TLV 

   The Reply Path (RP) TLV is optionally included in an echo request 
   message. It carries the specified return paths that the echo reply 
   message is required to follow. The format of RP TLV is as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |   RP (reply path) TLV Type    |          Length               |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
   |                       Reply Paths                             |   
   ~                                                               ~ 
   |                                                               |   
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   RP TLV Type field is 2 octets in length, and the type value is TBD 
   by IANA. 

   The Length field is 2 octets in length. It defines the length in 
   octets of the Reply Paths field. 

   The Reply Paths field is variable in length. It has several nested 
   sub-TLVs that describe the specified paths the echo reply message is 
   required to follow.  
 
 
Chen, et al.           Expires April 26, 2010                 [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft     Return Path Specified LSP Ping         October 2009 
    

    

   When the Reply Mode field is set to "Reply via specified path" in an 
   LSP echo request message, the RP TLV MUST be present. 

3.3. RP TLV sub-TLVs 

   Each of the FEC sub-TLVs defined in [RFC4379] is applicable to be a 
   sub-TLV for inclusion in the RP TLV for expressing a specific return 
   path.  

   In addition, four more new sub-TLVs are defined: IPv4 RSVP Tunnel 
   sub-TLV, IPv6 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLV, Bidirectional sub-TLV and Any 
   Candidate sub-TLV. Detailed definition is in the following sections. 

   With those sub-TLVs defined in [RFC4379] and the sub-TLVs defined in 
   this document, it could provide following options for return paths 
   specifying: 

   1. Specify a particular LSP as return path 
         - use those sub-TLVs defined in [RFC4379], 
            
   2. Specify a more generic tunnel FEC as return path 
         - use the IPv4/IPv6 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLVs defined in Section 
             3.3.1 and Section 3.3.2 of this document 
            
   3. Specify the reverse path of the bidirectional LSP as return path 
         - use the Bidirectional sub-TLV defined in Section 3.3.3 of 
             this document.  
            
   4. Force return path to pure IP path 
         - use the Any Candidate sub-TLV only 
            
   5. Allow any LSPs except specific or general ones as return path 
         - use the Any Candidate sub-TLV, 
         - and include other sub-TLVs 
    

3.3.1. IPv4 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLV 

   The IPv4 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLV is used in the RP TLV to allow the 
   operator to specify a more generic tunnel FEC other than a 
   particular LSP as the return path. The egress LSR chooses any LSP 
   from the LSPs that have the same Tunnel attributes and satisfy the

   conditions carried in the Flag field. The format of IPv4 RSVP Tunnel 
   sub-TLV is as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

   | IPv4 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLV Type |        Length                 | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                 IPv4 tunnel end point address                 |

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   The IPv4 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLV is derived from the RSVP IPv4 FEC TLV 
   that is defined in Section 3.2.3 [RFC4379]. All fields have the same 
   semantics as defined in [RFC4379] except that the LSP-ID field is 
   omitted and a new Flag field is defined. 

   The IPv4 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLV Type field is 2 octets in length, and 
   the recommended type value is 19 (to be confirmed by IANA). 

   The Flag field is 2 octets in length, it is used to notify the 
   egress LSR how to choose the return path. The Flag field is a bit 
   vector and has following format: 

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |      MUST be zero         |S|P| 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   P (Primary): the return path MUST be chosen from the LSPs that have 
   the same Tunnel attributes and the LSP MUST be the primary LSP.  

   S (Secondary): the return path MUST be chosen from the LSPs that 
   have the same Tunnel attributes and the LSP MUST be the secondary 
   LSP.

   P bit and S bit MUST not both be set. If P bit and S bit are both 
   not set, the return path could be any one of the LSPs that have the 
   same Tunnel attributes. 

3.3.2. IPv6 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLV 

   The IPv4 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLV is used in the RP TLV to allow the 
   operator to specify a more generic tunnel FEC other than a 
   particular LSP as the return path. The egress LSR chooses an LSP 
   from the LSPs that have the same Tunnel attributes and satisfy the 
   conditions carried in the Flag field. The format of IPv6 RSVP Tunnel 
   sub-TLV is as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

   |                                                               |

   The IPv6 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLV is derived from RSVP IPv6  FEC TLV that 
   is defined in Section 3.2.4 of [RFC4379].All fields have the same 
   semantics as defined in [RFC4379] except that the LSP-ID field is 
   omitted and a new Flag field is defined..  

   The IPv6 RSVP Tunnel sub-TLV Type field is 2 octets in length, and 
   the recommended type value is 20 (to be confirmed by IANA).

Internet-Draft     Return Path Specified LSP Ping         October 2009 
    

   The Flag field is 2 octets in length and is identical to that 
   described in Section 3.3. 

3.3.3. Bidirectional sub-TLV 

   The Bidirectional sub-TLV is used in the RP TLV when the return path 
   is required to follow the reverse direction of the tested 
   bidirectional LSP. The format of Bidirectional sub-TLV is as follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
    
   The Bidirectional sub-TLV Type field is 2 octets in length, and the 
   recommended type value is 17 (to be confirmed by IANA). 

   The Length field is 2 octets in length, the value of length field 
   MUST be 0, which means that there are no value fields following.  

3.3.4. Any Candidate sub-TLV 

   The Any Candidate sub-TLV is used in the RP TLV when the return path 
   is required to exclude the paths that are identified by any other 
   reply path sub-TLVs carried in the echo request message. This is 
   very useful when one or more previous LSP Ping attempts failed. By 
   carrying an Any Candidate sub-TLV and the previous failed reply path 
   sub-TLVs, a new LSP Ping echo request could be used to help the 
   egress LSR to select another candidate path when sending echo reply 
   message. If there is only an Any Candidate sub-TLV included in the 
   echo request (i.e., no other sub-TLVs are present in the RP TLV), 
   the egress LSR MUST select a non-LSP path (e.g., an IP path) as the 
   return path. This is very useful when reverse MPLS path problems are 
   suspected which can be confirmed when the echo reply is forced to 
   follow an IP path. The format of the Any Candidate sub-TLV is as 
   follows:

   The Any Candidate sub-TLV Type field is 2 octets in length, and the 
   recommended type value is 18 (to be confirmed by IANA). 

   The Length field is 2 octets in length, the value of length field 
   MUST be 0, it means that there is no any value fields follows. 

4. Theory of Operation 

   The procedures defined in this document currently only apply to 
   "ping" mode. The "traceroute" mode is out of scope for this document. 

   In [RFC4379], the echo reply is used to report the LSP checking 
   result to the LSP Ping initiator. This document defines a new reply 
   mode and a new TLV (RP TLV) which enable the LSP ping initiator to 
   specify or constrain the return path of the echo reply. Similarly 
   the behavior of echo reply is extended to detect the requested 
   return path by looking at a specified path FEC TLV. This enables LSP 
   Ping to detect failures in both directions of a path with a single 
   operation, this of course cuts in half the operational steps 
   required to verify the end to end bidirectional connectivity and 
   integrity of an LSP.  

   When the echo reply message is intended to test the return MPLS LSP 
   path, the destination IP address of the echo reply message MUST 
   never be used in a forwarding decision. To avoid this possibility 
   the destination IP address of the echo reply message that is 
   transmitted along the specified return path MUST be set to numbers 
   from the range 127/8 for IPv4 or 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:127/104 for IPv6, 
   and the IP TTL MUST be set 1.  Of course when the echo reply message 
   is not intended for testing the specified return path, the 
   procedures defined in [RFC4379] (the destination IP address is 
   copied from the source IP address) apply unchanged.  

4.1. Sending an Echo Request 

   When sending an echo request, in addition to the rules and 
   procedures defined in Section 4.3 of [RFC4379], the reply mode of 
   the echo request MUST be set to "Reply via specified path", and a RP 
   TLV MUST be carried in the echo request message correspondingly. The 

 
 
Chen, et al.           Expires April 26, 2010                [Page 11] 

Internet-Draft     Return Path Specified LSP Ping         October 2009 
    

   RP TLV includes one or several reply path sub-TLV(s) to identify the 
   return path(s) the egress LSR should use for its reply. 

   For a bidirectional LSP, since the ingress LSR and egress LSR of a 
   bidirectional LSP are aware of the relationship between the forward 
   and backward direction LSPs, only a Bidirectional sub-TLV SHOULD be 
   carried within the RP TLV. If the operator wants the echo reply to 
   be sent along a different path other than the reverse direction of 
   the bidirectional LSP, another FEC sub-TLV SHOULD be carried in the 
   RP TLV instead. 

   In some cases, operators may want to treat two unidirectional LSPs 
   (one for each direction) as a pair. There may not be any binding 
   relationship between the two LSPs. Using the mechanism defined in 
   this document, operators can run LSP Ping one time from one end to 
   complete the failure detection on both unidirectional LSPs. To 
   accomplish this, the echo request message MUST carry (in the RP TLV) 
   a FEC sub-TLV that belongs to the backward LSP. 

4.2. Receiving an Echo Request 

   "Ping" mode processing as defined in Section 4.4 of [RFC4379] 
   applies in this document. In addition, when an echo request is 
   received, if the egress LSR does not know the reply mode defined in 
   this document, an echo reply with the return code set to "Malformed 
   echo request" and the Subcode set to zero will be send back to the 
   ingress LSR according to the rules of [RFC4379]. If the egress LSR 
   knows the reply mode, according to the RP TLV, it SHOULD find and 
   select the desired return path, if there is no such path, an echo 
   reply with Errored TLVs [RFC4379] that contains the RP TLV SHOULD be 
   sent back to the ingress LSR, which is used to tell the ingress LSR 
   that the requested return path does not exist.  

   As described in Section 3.3.4 of this document, the Any Candidate 
   sub-TLV has two functions: 1) helping the egress LSR to exclude some 
   undesired paths, and 2) indicating whether the return path SHOULD be 
   tested (by carrying the FEC stack TLV of the return path). 

   If an Any Candidate sub-TLV is present, the egress LSR MUST exclude 
   the paths identified by those FEC sub-TLVs carried in the RP TLV and 
   select other path to send the echo reply.  

   If no Any Candidate sub-TLV is present, it means that the echo reply 
   is REQUIRED not only to send along the specified path, but to detect 
   the selected return path as well (by carrying the FEC stack TLV of 
   the return path). In addition, the FEC validate results of forward 

 
 
Chen, et al.           Expires April 26, 2010                [Page 12] 

Internet-Draft     Return Path Specified LSP Ping         October 2009 
    

   path LSP SHOULD not affect the egress LSR continue to test return 
   path LSP. 

4.3. Sending an Echo Reply 

   As described in [RFC4379], the echo reply message is a UDP packet, 
   and it MUST be sent only in response to an MPLS echo request. The 
   source IP address is a routable IP address of the replier, the 
   source UDP port is the well-know UDP port for LSP ping. 

   When the echo reply is intended to test the return path, the 
   destination IP address of the echo reply message MUST never be used 
   in a forwarding decision. To avoid this problem, the IP destination 
   address of the echo reply message that is transmitted along the 
   specified return path MUST be set to numbers from the range 127/8 
   for IPv4 or 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:127/104 for IPv6, and the IP TTL MUST be 
   set 1. If the echo reply is required to test the return path, the 
   echo reply MUST have a FEC stack TLV describing the return path, 
   which is used for the ingress LSR to perform FEC validation. The FEC 
   stack TLV of the forward path MUST NOT be copied to the echo reply. 
   And the FEC stack TLV of forward LSP MUST not be copied to the echo 
   reply. 

   If the echo reply message is not intended for testing the specified 
   return path, the same as defined in [RFC4379], the destination IP 
   address and UDP port are copied from the source IP address and 
   source UDP port of the echo request.  

   When sending the echo reply, the RP TLV carried in the received echo 
   request MAY be copied to the echo reply to give the Ingress LSR 
   enough information about the reverse direction of the tested path to 
   verify the consistency of the data plane against control plane. 

4.4. Receiving an Echo Reply 

   The rules and process defined in Section 4.6 of [RFC4379] apply here. 
   When an echo reply is received, if the reply mode is "Reply via 
   specified path" and a FEC stack TLV exists, it means that the echo 
   reply has both Ping result reporting and reverse path checking 
   functions. The ingress LSR MUST do FEC validation as an egress LSR 
   does when receiving an echo request, the FEC validation process 
   (relevant to "ping" mode) defined in Section 4.4.1 of [RFC4379] 
   applies here.  

   When an echo reply is received with return code set to "Malformed 
   echo request received" and the Subcode set to zero. It is possible 

 
 
Chen, et al.           Expires April 26, 2010                [Page 13] 

Internet-Draft     Return Path Specified LSP Ping         October 2009 
    

   that the egress LSR may not know the "Reply via specified path" 
   reply mode, the operator may choose to re-perform another LSP Ping 
   by using one of the four reply modes defined [RFC4379]. 

   On receipt of an echo reply with an Errored TLVs and an RP TLV is 
   carried, if the return code is not set to "TLV not understood", it 
   means that the egress LSR could not find a matched return path as 
   specified. Operators may choose to specify another LSP as the return 
   path or use other methods to detect the path. 

   When the LSP Ping initiator fails after some time to receive the 
   echo reply message, the operator MAY initiate another LSP Ping by 
   resending a new echo request carrying a RP TLV that includes an Any 
   Candidate sub-TLV and the previous sent reply path sub-TLV(s) 
   (Bidirectional sub-TLV or FEC sub-TLVs) to notify the egress LSR to 
   send echo reply message along any other workable path (no matter 
   what MPLS LSP or IP path) excluding the path(s) identified by those 
   Bidirectional sub-TLV or/and FEC sub-TLVs. Hence it could improve 
   the reliability of the echo reply message. In such a mode, the echo 
   reply SHOULD NOT be used to detect the return path. 

5. Security Considerations 

   Security considerations discussed in [RFC4379] apply to this 
   document. In addition to that, in order to prevent using the 
   extension defined in this document for "proxying" any possible 
   attacks, the return path LSP MUST have destination to the same node 
   where the forward path is from.  

6. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to make the following allocations from registries 
   under its control. 

6.1. Reply mode 

   IANA is requested to assign a new reply mode as follows:
