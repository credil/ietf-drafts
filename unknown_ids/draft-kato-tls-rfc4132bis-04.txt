Abstract

   This document specifies a set of cipher suites for the Transport
   Security Layer (TLS) protocol to support the Camellia encryption
   algorithm as a block cipher.  It amends the ciphersuites originally
   specifed in RFC 4132 by counterparts using the newer cryptographic
   hash algorithms from the SHA-2 familiy.  This document obsoletes RFC
   4132.


1.  Introduction

   This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] protocol to support the
   Camellia [RFC3713] encryption algorithm as a block cipher algorithm,
   adding variants using the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash
   algorithms [FIPS180-3] to the TLS cipher suite portfolio originally
   specified in RFC 4132 [RFC4132].  This document obsoletes RFC 4132.

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [RFC3713].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Proposed Cipher Suites

   The cipher suites defined here have the following identifiers:

3.  Cipher Suite Definitions

3.1.  Key Exchange

   The RSA, DHE_RSA, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DH_DSS, and DH_anon key exchanges
   are performed as defined in [RFC5246].

3.2.  Cipher

   The CAMELLIA_128_CBC cipher suites use Camellia [RFC3713] in CBC mode
   with a 128-bit key and 128-bit IV; the CAMELLIA_256_CBC cipher suites
   use a 256-bit key and 128-bit IV.

3.3.  Hash and Pseudorandom Function

3.3.1.  Hash and Pseudorandom Function for TLS 1.1

   The cipher suites ending with _SHA use HMAC-SHA1 as the MAC
   algorithm.

Internet-Draft       Camellia Cipher Suites for TLS           April 2009


   When used with TLS versions prior to 1.2, the PRF is calculated as
   specified in the appropriate version of the TLS specification.

3.3.2.  Hash and Pseudorandom Function for TLS 1.2

   The cipher suites ending with _SHA256 use HMAC-SHA-256 as the MAC
   algorithm.

   For TLS version 1.2, the PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] with SHA-256 as
   the hash function.

   The cipher suites ending with _SHA256 use HMAC-SHA-256 as the MAC
   algorithm.  The PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] with SHA-256 as the hash
   function.  These cipher suites MUST NOT be negotiated by TLS 1.1 or
   earlier versions.  Clients MUST NOT offer these cipher suites if they
   do not offer TLS 1.2 or later.  Servers which select an earlier
   version of TLS MUST NOT select one of thse cipher suites.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has already allocated the following numbers for RFC 4132, and is
   requested to update them to reference this document:

  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA         = { 0x00,0x41 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x42 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x43 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA     = { 0x00,0x44 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA     = { 0x00,0x45 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA     = { 0x00,0x46 };

  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA         = { 0x00,0x84 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x85 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x86 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA     = { 0x00,0x87 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA     = { 0x00,0x88 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA     = { 0x00,0x89 };

   IANA is requested to allocate (has allocated) the following numbers
   in the TLS Cipher Suite Registry:

    CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256   = { TBD,TBD };

    CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256  = { TBD,TBD };

    CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256      = { TBD,TBD };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256   = { TBD,TBD };

    CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256  = { TBD,TBD };


5.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document, there are no known weak keys
   for Camellia.

   Also, Security issues are discussed throughout RFC 5246 [RFC5246],
   especially in Appendices D, E, and F of [RFC5246].
