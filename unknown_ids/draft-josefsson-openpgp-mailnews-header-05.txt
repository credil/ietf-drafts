Internet-Draft   The OpenPGP mail and news header field       April 2008


1.  Preface

   This document is intended to define the "OpenPGP" message header
   field.  This field should be considered "informational" (and
   "optional"), and be suitable for both mail [RFC2822] and netnews
   [RFC1036] messages.  This field should be used to provide information
   about the sender's OpenPGP [RFC4880] key.  This field MAY be used in
   any message.

   This document should be interpreted within the context of RFC 2822.
   In the event of a discrepancy, refer to that document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Background and Motivation

   There are quite a few PGP and GnuPG users who add header fields with
   information about the sender's OpenPGP key.  Fields in current use
   include "X-PGP:", "X-PGP-Key:", "X-Request-PGP:", "X-PGP-KeyID:", and
   "X-PGP-Fingerprint:".  The fields are not standardized, so they
   cannot be reliably parsed automatically by applications, only parsed
   by humans.

   Since both PGP and GnuPG rely on the OpenPGP protocol, it appear
   preferable to use the term "OpenPGP" rather than "PGP", or "GPG", in
   the field name.  The latter forms appear as underhanded attempts to
   advocate specific applications, rather than the open standard they
   both share.  The field specified here is named "OpenPGP".

   The OpenPGP field is not a required part of successful use of OpenPGP
   in e-mail or other messages.  It is intended as a convenience, in
   those situations where the user experience may be enhanced by using
   the information in the field.  Consequently, the information in the
   field should not disrupt the normal OpenPGP key retrieval and web of
   trust mechanism.  Neither the integrity nor the authenticity of the
   information in the field should be assumed to be correct or trust-
   worthy.

   No specific scenario when the field should be used, nor how it should
   be used in that scenario, are suggested by this document.  It is
   acknowledged that the dominant use of the information in the field
   may be by humans and not applications.

   To promote good use of the field, care should be taken so that
   applications do not trigger error messages that may annoy the user,

   when an error condition arise during handling of the OpenPGP field.
   It is generally recommended that an implementation ignore the
   presence of the OpenPGP fields if it would cause an error condition.
   Since the field is optional, this approach should not be difficult to
   implement.  The philosophy here is to enable an enhanced user
   experience.  Error messages rarely contribute to that goal.


3.  OpenPGP Header Field

   The OpenPGP header field is intended to present characteristics of
   the sender's OpenPGP key.  The field typically contains the Key ID
   and the URL where the key can be retrieved.

   Because the mail header is typically not integrity protected, the
   information conveyed in the OpenPGP header field MUST NOT be trusted
   without additional verification.  Some of the information given in
   this field may also be given in the OpenPGP key itself.  When these
   two sources conflict, users SHOULD favor the information from the
   OpenPGP key, as that information can be cryptographically protected.

   The field is of a "structured" type (see section 2.2.2 of RFC 2822).
   In general, the structure consist of one or more parameters, each
   consisting of one attribute and one value.  The terminology and
   format of the field was inspired by MIME [RFC2045].  The various
   provisions of RFC 2045 apply.  In particular, the value part of
   parameters may be quoted; whitespace, folding and comments may occur
   in the middle of parameters; except as noted below.  The provisions
   of MIME [RFC2231] also apply; in particular it deals with handling
   parameters of excessive length.

   The OpenPGP header field is defined as below in the Augmented BNF
   [RFC5234] notation.  By itself, however, this grammar is incomplete.
   It refers by name to syntax rules that are defined in [RFC2822] and
   [RFC3986].  Rather than reproduce those definitions here, and risk
   unintentional differences between the two, this document refer the
   reader to the other documents for the definition of non-terminals.

   Implementations MUST understand the "id", "url", and "preference"
   attributes.  Parameter with unrecognized attributes MUST be ignored.
   The grammar permit unknown parameters to allow for future extensions.
   Each parameter attribute (e.g., "url") MUST NOT occur more than once
   in any single instance of the OpenPGP field.  The OpenPGP field
   itself MAY occur more than once in a single email (for example if the
   sender has multiple keys).

   openpgp     = "OpenPGP:" SP *CFWS o-params CRLF
                   ; CFWS is defined in RFC 2822.
                   ; SP and CRLF are defined in RFC 5234.

   o-params    = (o-parameter *CFWS *(";" *CFWS o-params))

   o-parameter =
                 ("id" "=" id) /
                 ("url" "=" url) /
                 ("preference" "=" preference) /
                 parameter ; normally unused, for extensions
                   ; parameter is defined in RFC 2045.

   id          = 8*HEXDIG
                   ; HEXDIG is defined in RFC 5234.
                   ; Matching of value is case-insensitive.

   url         = absoluteURI / quoted-url
                   ; absoluteURI is defined in RFC 3986.
                   ; If URL contains the character ';',
                   ; the quoted-url form MUST be used.

   quoted-url  = DQUOTE absoluteURI DQUOTE
                   ; DQUOTE is defined in RFC 5234.

   preference  = "sign" / "encrypt" / "signencrypt" / "unprotected"
                   ; Matching of values are case-insensitive.

3.1.  Primary Key ID field: id

   The "id" parameter, if present, MUST hold the Key ID or key
   fingerprint for the primary key.  The value uses the hex [RFC4648]
   notation.  The parameter value is case-insensitive.

   The length of the field determine whether it denotes a Key ID (8 hex
   symbols), a long Key ID (16 hex symbols), a v3 key fingerprint (32
   hex symbols), or a v4 key fingerprint (40 hex symbols).

   Note that each of the following examples includes a comment, which is
   optional.

       id=12345678 (short key ID)
       id=1234567890ABCDEF (long key ID)
       id=1234567890abcdef0123456789ABCDEF01234567 (v4 fingerprint)
       id=1234567890ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF (v3 fingerprint, deprecated)

Internet-Draft   The OpenPGP mail and news header field       April 2008


3.2.  Key URL field: url

   The "url" parameter, if present, MUST specify a URL where the public
   key can be found.  It is RECOMMENDED to use a common URL family, such
   as HTTP [RFC2616] or FTP [RFC0959].  The URL MUST be fully qualified,
   MUST explicitly specify a protocol and SHOULD be accessible on the
   public Internet.

   The content of where the URL points SHOULD be either an ASCII armored
   or binary OpenPGP packet containing the key.  A valid reason for
   storing something else may be if the key has been revoked.

   For example:

       url=http://example.org/pgp.txt
       url="http://example.org/funny;name.txt"

   If the URL contains the character ';' the entire URL MUST be quoted,
   as illustrated in the example.

3.3.  Protection Preference Field: preference

   The "preference" parameter, if present, specify the quality of
   protection preferred by the sender.  The parameter value is case-
   insensitive.

   The available values are as follows.  A "unprotected" token means
   that the sender prefer not to receive OpenPGP protected e-mails.  A
   "sign" token means that the sender prefer to receive digitally signed
   e-mails.  A "encrypt" token means that the sender prefer to receive
   encrypted e-mails.  A "signencrypt" token means that the sender
   prefer to receive encrypted and signed e-mails.

   Note that there is no normative requirement on the receiver to follow
   the stated preference.

   For example:

       preference=sign
       preference=unprotected
       preference=ENCRYPT


4.  Comments

   As discussed in section 3.2.3 of RFC 2822, comments may appear in
   header field bodies.  Comments are not intended to be interpreted by
   any application, but to provide additional information for humans.

   The following are examples of OpenPGP fields with comments:

     id=B565716F (key stored on non-networked laptop)
     id=12345678 (1024 bit RSA Key for Encrypt or Sign)
     id=ABCD0123 (created Sun Jan  2 02:25:15 CET 2005)


5.  Examples

   These are valid examples of how the field may be used.  This list is
   not meant to be exhaustive, but to reflect expected typical usages.

     OpenPGP: id=12345678
     OpenPGP: url=http://example.com/key.txt
     OpenPGP: preference=unprotected
     OpenPGP: url=http://example.com/key.txt; id=12345678
     OpenPGP: id=12345678; url=http://example.com/key.txt;
              preference=signencrypt
     OpenPGP: url=http://example.com/key.txt (down 2-3pm UTC);
              id=12345678 (this key is only used at the office);
              preference=sign (unsigned emails are filtered away)
     OpenPGP: id=12345678; url="http://example.com/openpgp;key.txt"

7.  Security Considerations

   The OpenPGP header field is intended to be a convenience in locating
   public keys.  The OpenPGP header is neither secure nor intended to
   be.  Since the message header is easy to spoof, information contained
   in the header should not be trusted.  The information must be
   verified.

   Applications that interpret the field MUST NOT assume that the
   content is correct, and MUST NOT present the data to the user in any
   way that would cause the user to assume that it is correct.
   Applications that interpret the data within the field SHOULD alert

   the user that this information is not a substitute for personally
   verifying keys and being a part of the web of trust.

   If an application receives a signed message and uses the information
   in the field to automatically retrieve a key, the application MAY
   ignore the retrieved key if it is not the same key used to sign the
   message.  This SHOULD be done before the newly retrieved key is
   imported into the user's keyring.

   The use of HTTPS [RFC2818], DNSSEC [RFC4033], SMTP STARTTLS
   [RFC3207], IMAP/POP3 STARTTLS [RFC2595] and other secure protocols,
   may enhance the security of information conveyed through this field,
   but does not guarantee any level of security or authenticity.
   Developers and users must remain aware of this.

   Version 3 OpenPGP keys can be created with a chosen key id (aka "the
   0xDEADBEEF attack").  Verifying the Key ID of a retrieved key against
   the one provided in the field is thus not sufficient to protect
   against a man-in-the-middle attack.  Instead, the web-of-trust
   mechanism should be used.

   If an attacker wants to check the validity of email addresses, he
   might email arbitrary addresses with a unique OpenPGP header field
   URL (presumably an URL under the attacker's control).  The attacker
   can verify the liveness of each email address by checking if the URL
   for each particular recipient has been retrieved.  To protect against
   this, implementations MUST inform the user of that potential privacy
   issue when retrieving keys from an URL provided by the field of an
   inbound email message: either when the feature is enabled or to be
   used for the first time or every time the MUA detects an unknown key.

   Given the flexibility of the syntax of the field, slightly varying
   the content between messages can be used as a covert channel.  This
   is already possible using other header fields in email, and thus the
   OpenPGP field do not introduce a new vulnerability here.


8.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is asked to register the OpenPGP header field, using the
   template as follows, in accordance with RFC 3864 [RFC3864].

   Header field name: OpenPGP

   Applicable protocol: mail, netnews

   Status: informational
