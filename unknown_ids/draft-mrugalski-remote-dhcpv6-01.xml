    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes remote autoconfiguration mechanism, an
        extension to DHCPv6 protocol. Every time a node attaches to a new link, it must
	renew or obtain new address and parameters, using DHCPv6
	protocol. For mobile nodes it is beneficial to obtain
	address and other configuration parameters remotely, before
	actually attaching to destination link. This document defines
	mechanism using remote configuration and new options 
    required to remotely discover destination DHCPv6 servers. Remote 
    unicast communication with DHCPv6 servers is also defined.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

    <section title="Classic handover and DHCPv6 configuration">
    <t>During normal operation, a node attaches to a link (e.g. 
    after completing, waking up from standby mode, booting up etc.)
    and, if certain condtions are met (see <xref target="RFC4862"></xref>),
    it initiates DHCPv6 operation. It is assumed that initial communication
    with servers (directly or via relays) is performed locally, i.e.
    client and server or relay are attached to the same link.</t>

    <t>In certain mobility scenarios, it may be beneficial to
    initiate configuration and obtain parameters before physically
    attaching to local link. 
    When client (a mobile IPv6 node, likely to be conformant to 
    <xref target="RFC3775"></xref>) changes its physical location, 
    radio signal and other metrics deteriorate and eventually handover decision is made.
	During normal handover procedure, data link layer (e.g. IEEE 802.11 or 
    IEEE 802.16) performs handover procedure. This phase is sometimes
	referred to as link layer handover. After such procedure is completed,
	IPv6 reconfiguration is started. After client
	attaches to its new location, it tries to confirm old or
	obtain new configuration parameters, using DHCPv6 CONFIRM or
	SOLICIT messages. After discovering available DHCPv6 servers,
	MN requests new address and possibly other configuration
	options. Once DHCPv6 configuration is complete, it may start
	other handover related activities, like updating Correspondent
	Nodes (CN) or Home Agent (HA) using Binding Update
	procedure <xref target="RFC3775"></xref>. If aforementioned
	actions are preformed sequencially, delays introduced by each layer 
    are adding up, resulting in a large overall	delay. This introduces
	gaps in communication capabilites that should be avoided, if possible.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Remote DHCPv6 Rationale">
      <t>Instead of performing DHCPv6 configuration after physically 
        attaching to a link, client communicates with server (or 
        relay) located at destination link remotely, while still
        being attached to the old link. Assuming client is able
        to communicate with destination server, it may obtain all
        requested parameters. Although this mechanism is generic
        and not tied to any specific mobility mechanism, there are
        number of benefits client could gain from learning its 
        parameters before handover:</t>
      
      <list>
        <t>Mobile Client may perform certain actions earlier, e.g. Mobile Client 
          may send Binding Update notifications to 
          its correspondent nodes before performing handover. This 
          may potentially halve the Round Trip Time delay.</t>
        <t>Mobile Client may perform many actions at once, e.g. 
          update CNs about its new address while initiating handover 
          preparation. Some network access technologies like IEEE 
          802.16 (WiMAX) allow node to initiate handover procedure 
          and remain attached to old base station. Node maintains 
          full communication capability at that time. The exact detachment 
          event is left up to the client.</t>
        <t>Mobile Client may consider several target locations as
          target destinations. The knowledge about availability 
          (or lack of thereof) of requested services may be leveraged
          during destination selection.</t>
      </list>

      <t>The exact way of exploiting gained knowledge via remote
        autoconfiguration mechanism is outside of scope of this 
        document.</t>
    </section>
    
    </section>

    <section title="Remote DHCPv6 Operation">
      <t>Client, while still connected to its old location, gains
	    information about DHCPv6 servers located at possible handover
	    destinations. One of the possible ways to determine such
	    addresses is specified
	    in <xref target="discover-neighbors"></xref>.</t>
      <t>After gaining
	    knowledge about potential destinations, client chooses one or
	    more destinations and obtains configuration parameters from
	    each chosen location, as defined in <xref target="remote-conf"></xref>.
        The target selection algorithm is outside of scope of this document.</t>
      <t>After changing point of attachment, client behaves as described
        in <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>: attempts to verify its address using
        CONFIRM message.</t>
      <t>Discussion: The concept may be briefly described as &quot;extending unicast 
        communication.&quot; Maybe reference to Server Unicast Option should
        be explicitly mentioned?</t>

      <section anchor="discover-neighbors" title="Discovering Neighboring Networks">
	    <t>Client, while still connected to its old location, sends
	      regular SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW or REBIND message to its
	      locally available DHCPv6 server. Client includes OPTION_NEIGHBORS code 
          in the transmitted Option Request Option (ORO). Server responds with the list
	      of addresses of DHCPv6 servers located at possible
	      handover targets. Such list is conveyed in
	      OPTION_NEIGHBORS option.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="remote-conf" title="Remote Autoconfiguration">
      <t>Client communicates with remote one or more DHCPv6 servers, located at
	    potential destination. To do so, client transmits SOLICIT
	    message to known server unicast address and includes
	    OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF (defined in
	    <xref target="options-format"></xref>. Server, supporting remote
	    autoconfiguration responds as if the message was received
	    locally, e.g. responds with ADVERTISE to client's SOLICIT
	    message. Client continues remote configuration using
	    REQUEST or CONFIRM message. Server concludes remote
	    autoconfiguration by responding using REPLY message.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="options-format" title="DHCPv6 Options Format">
      <t>Following sections define two DHCPv6 options, used in 
        remote autoconfiguration process.</t>
      <section title="Neighbors Option Format" >
      <t>Neighbors Option is used to announce neighboring
        DHCPv6 servers, located in nearby networks. Client requests
        this option to learn about DHCPv6 servers located at nearby
        networks (potential candidates for handovers).

      <t>Discussion: While some network access technologies allow 
        discovery of neighboring networks (e.g. Neighbor Advertisments
        or Scanning mechanism in 802.16 networks), but they provide
        information on link layer level (e.g. BS ID in case of 802.16
        networks). Some mapping between IP information (i.e. neighboring
        DHCPv6 servers) and link layer level (e.g. BSID) may be
        considered here. If such approach is deemed feasible, Neighbors
        Option format should be extended with additional link layer information.</t>

      <t>The Remote Autoconfiguration Option may include suboptions.
        Currently there are no such suboptions defined.</t>
      <t>Discussion: The Remote Autoconfiguration Option is used to
        inform server that client is currently located off-link, but
        would like to get on-link configuration. Also, it informs
        server that unicast communication from non-local prefix.
        However, if server is configured to allow such communication,
        it does not need to know about client's current location (just 
        treat it as regular, local client). In that case, this option
        is not needed.</t>

    <section anchor="server" title="DHCPv6 Server Behavior">
      <t>Servers conformant to this specification MUST support
        unicast communication.</t>
      <t>Server MUST NOT send OPTION_NEIGHBOR to client, unless
      client explicitly requested such option.</t>

    <section anchor="client" title="DHCPv6 Client Behavior">
      <t>Client supporting remote autoconfiguration, SHOULD request
      OPTION_NEIGHBORS every time it sends SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW,
      REBIND or CONFIRM messages.</t>
      <t>Client MUST include OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF in its messages,
        if communicating with server remotely (i.e. client and server
        are currently not on the same link).</t>
      <t>Client MAY initiate remote autoconfiguration at its own
      discretion. Depending on client policy, that may be as soon as
      local configuration is completed, when radio signal quality
      degrades and handover is imminent or when other implementation
      specific conditions are met.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is requested to allocate two DHCPv6 option codes
	referencing this document: OPTION_NEIGHBORS and OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The overall security considerations discussed in <xref
      target="RFC3315"></xref> apply also to this
      document. OPTION_REMOTE_AUTOCONF may be used to attack known
      DHCPv6 server, but that does not differ from attacks directed
      at servers supporting unicast address option. Compromised 
      DHCPv6 server may be used to misinform clients about available
      nearby networks.</t>

      <t>Neither of the above considerations are new and specific to the
      proposed remote configuration option. The mechanisms identified for securing DHCPv6 as
      well as reasonable checks performed by client implementations are deemed
      sufficient in addressing these problems.</t>
