Internet-Draft            DS-Lite DHCPv6 Option               March 2011


1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Dual-Stack Lite [I-D.softwire-ds-lite] is a solution to offer both
   IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity to customers which are addressed only with
   an IPv6 prefix (no IPv4 address is assigned to the attachment
   device).  One of its key components is an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel,
   commonly referred to as a Softwire.  A DS-Lite "Basic Bridging
   BroadBand" (B4) device will not know if the network it is attached to
   offers Dual-Stack Lite service, and if it did would not know the
   remote endpoint of the tunnel to establish a softwire.

   To inform the B4 of the Address Family Transition Router's (AFTR)
   location, a DNS [RFC1035] hostname may be used.  Once this
   information is conveyed, the presence of the configuration indicating
   the AFTR's location also informs a host to initiate Dual-Stack Lite
   (DS-Lite) service and become a Softwire Initiator.

   To provide the conveyance of the configuration information, a single
   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] option is used, expressing the AFTR's Fully
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) to the B4 element.

   The details of how the B4 establishes an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire to the
   AFTR are out of scope for this document.


3.  The AFTR-Name DHCPv6 Option

   The AFTR-Name option consists of option-code and option-len fields
   (as all DHCPv6 options have), and a variable length tunnel-endpoint-
   name field containing a fully qualified domain name that refers to
   the AFTR which the client MAY connect to.

   The AFTR-Name option SHOULD NOT appear in any other than the
   following DHCPv6 messages: Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew,
   Rebind, Information-Request and Reply.

   The format of the AFTR-Name option is shown in the following figure:

       +---------------------------------------------------------------+

           OPTION_AFTR_NAME: (TBD)

                 option-len: Length of the tunnel-endpoint-name field in
                             octets.

       tunnel-endpoint-name: A fully qualified domain name of the AFTR
                             tunnel endpoint.

                 Figure 1: AFTR-Name DHCPv6 Option Format

   The tunnel-endpoint-name field is formatted as required in DHCPv6
   [RFC3315] Section 8 ("Representation and Use of Domain Names").
   Briefly, the format described is using a single octet noting the
   length of one DNS label (limited to at most 63 octets), followed by
   the label contents.  This repeats until all labels in the FQDN are
   exhausted, including a terminating zero-length label.  Any updates to
   Section 8 of DHCPv6 [RFC3315] also apply to encoding of this field.
   An example format for this option is shown in Figure 2, which conveys
   the FQDN "aftr.example.com.".

        +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
        | 0x04 |   a  |   f  |   t  |   r  | 0x07 |   e  |   x  |   a  |
        +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
        |   m  |   p  |   l  |   e  | 0x03 |   c  |   o  |   m  | 0x00 |
        +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+

                  Figure 2: Example tunnel-endpoint-name.

   Note that in the specific case of the example tunnel-endpoint-name
   (Figure 2), the length of the tunnel-endpoint-name is 18 octets, and
   so an option-len field value of 18 would be used.

   The option is validated by confirming that all of the following
   conditions are met:

   1.  the option-len is greater than 3;

Internet-Draft            DS-Lite DHCPv6 Option               March 2011


   2.  the option data can be contained by the option length (that the
       option length does not run off the end of the packet);

   3.  the individual label lengths do not exceed the option length;

   4.  the tunnel-endpoint-name is of valid format as described in
       DHCPv6 Section 8 [RFC3315];

   5.  there are no compression tags;

   6.  there is at least one label of nonzero length.


4.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   A DHCPv6 server SHOULD NOT send more than one AFTR-Name option.  It
   SHOULD NOT permit the configuration of multiple names within one
   AFTR-Name option.  Both of these conditions are handled exceptionally
   by the client, so an operator using software that does not perform
   these validations should be careful not to configure multiple domain
   names.

   RFC 3315 Section 17.2.2 [RFC3315] describes how a DHCPv6 client and
   server negotiate configuration values using the Option Request Option
   (OPTION_ORO).  As a convenience to the reader, we mention here that a
   server will not reply with a AFTR-Name option if the client has not
   explicitly enumerated it on its Option Request Option.


5.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   A client that supports the B4 functionality of DS-Lite (defined in
   [I-D.softwire-ds-lite]) and conforms to this specification MUST
   include OPTION_AFTR_NAME on its OPTION_ORO.

   Because it requires DNS name to address resolution, the client MAY
   also wish to include the OPTION_DNS_SERVERS [RFC3646] option on its
   OPTION_ORO.

   If the client receives the AFTR-Name option, it MUST verify the
   option contents as described in Section 3.

   Note that in different environments, the B4 element and DHCPv6 client
   may be integrated, joined, or separated by a third pieces of
   software.  For the purpose of this specification, we refer to the "B4
   system" when specifying implementation steps that may be processed at
   any stage of integration between the DHCPv6 client software and the
   B4 element it is configuring.

Internet-Draft            DS-Lite DHCPv6 Option               March 2011


   If the B4 system receives more than one AFTR-Name option, it MUST use
   only the first instance of that option.

   If the AFTR-Name option contains more than one FQDN, as distinguished
   by the presence of multiple root labels, the B4 system MUST use only
   the first FQDN listed in configuration.

   The B4 system performs standard DNS resolution using the provided
   FQDN to resolve a AAAA Resource Record, as defined in [RFC3596] and
   STD 13 [RFC1034] [RFC1035].

   If any DNS response contains more than one IPv6 address, the B4
   system picks only one IPv6 address and uses it as a remote tunnel
   endpoint for the interface being configured in the current message
   exchange.  The B4 system MUST NOT establish more than one DS-Lite
   tunnel at the same time per interface.  For a redundancy and high
   availability discussion, see Section 12.3 "High availability" of
   [I-D.softwire-ds-lite].

   Note that a B4 system may have multiple network interfaces, and these
   interfaces may be configured differently; some may be connected to
   networks that call for DS-Lite, and some may be connected to networks
   that are using normal dual stack or other means.  The B4 system
   should approach this specification on an interface-by-interface
   basis.  For example, if the B4 system is attached to multiple
   networks that provide the AFTR Name option, then the B4 system MUST
   configure a tunnel for each interface separately as each DS-Lite
   tunnel provides IPv4 connectivity for each distinct interface.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not present any new security issues, but as with
   all DHCPv6-derived configuration state, it is completely possible
   that the configuration is being delivered by a third party (Man In
   The Middle).  As such, there is no basis to trust that the access the
   DS-Lite Softwire connection represents can be trusted, and it should
   not therefore bypass any security mechanisms such as IP firewalls.

   RFC 3315 [RFC3315] discusses DHCPv6-related security issues.

   [I-D.softwire-ds-lite] discusses DS-Lite related security issues.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate single DHCPv6 option code referencing
   this document, delineating OPTION_AFTR_NAME.
