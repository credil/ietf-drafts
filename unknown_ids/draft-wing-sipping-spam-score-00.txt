Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism for SIP proxies to communicate a
   spam score to downstream SIP proxies and SIP user agents so they can
   provide alternate call routing or call handling.

Internet-Draft               SIP Spam Score                  August 2007


1.  Introduction

   It is desirable for SIP proxies to insert a spam score so that
   downstream SIP proxies and downstream SIP user agents can use a high
   score to decide that special handling is required.  For example, a
   score above 20 might cause one of the spam avoidance techniques,
   described in [I-D.ietf-sipping-spam], to be triggered for this call.

   This specification allows each SIP proxy to contribute spam scoring
   information that can be useful to downstream SIP proxies and the SIP
   UA.  The downstream SIP proxies might ignore that information (e.g.,
   they don't trust it) or might use it (e.g., they trust it because it
   was generated by a federation).

   From a deployment point of view it is expected that the score will
   most likely be benefical (and trustworthy) when inserted by a SIP
   proxy on the recipients side for evaluation by a SIP UA that has a
   direct relationship with this SIP proxy.


2.  Operation of Spam-Scoring Proxy

   A SIP proxy generates a spam score using a local mechanism.  Negative
   scores indicate the SIP request is not considered spam, and positive
   scores indicate the SIP request is considered spam.  The higher the
   value, the more likely a message is spam or is not spam.

   This spam score is inserted into the "Via:" header, which is already
   generated by the proxy.

      The Via header was chosen because it the Via is already correlated
      with the proxy that generated the Via header.


3.  Operation of Proxy or User Agent

   A downstream proxy MAY use the spam score or spam-detail information
   to change call routing or call handling.  It is RECOMMENDED that only
   scores generated by trusted proxies be used.  The behavior of the SIP
   proxy or user agent when the spam score is above a certain value is a
   local matter.  Examples of behavior include:

   o  a SIP request with a high spam score might cause a proxy or user
      agent to redirect the SIP request to company's main telephone
      extension or to the user's voicemail

   o  a user agent might alert the user by flashing the phone (without
      audible ringing)

Internet-Draft               SIP Spam Score                  August 2007


   o  a user agent might allow calls with a spam score below a certain
      value during daylight hours, but deny such calls at night.

   o  a proxy might challenge the caller to complete a Turing test.

   These aspects are discussed in
   [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-framework-spit-reduction].


4.  ABNF

   ABNF using the ABNF syntax of [RFC3261]:

     via-extension      = spam-score / spam-detail

     spam-score         = "spam" EQUAL score
     score              = *"-" 1*4DIGIT [ "." 0*3DIGIT ]

     spam-detail        = "spam-detail" EQUAL detail
     detail             = QUOTE mech SEMI rule-score
                          *(COMMA rule-score) QUOTE
     rule-score         = rule [ "=" score ]
     mech               = token
     rule               = token

5.  Examples

   The following example shows a SIP score generated by biloxi.com and
   atlanta.com.  In this example, atlanta.com is owned by a spammer who
   is trying to fool downstream systems with their low spam score (0.0).
   However, the biloxi.com proxies and user agents only pay attention to
   spam scores from Via:  headers generated by biloxi.com proxies, so
   atlanta.com's attempts are in vain.

     INVITE sip:bob@biloxi.com SIP/2.0
     Via: SIP/2.0/UDP biloxi.com;branch=z9hG4bKnashds8
       ;received=192.0.2.1
       ;spam=-5
       ;spam-detail="Hormel-1.0;whitelist=-10,call_volume=5"
     Via: SIP/2.0/UDP sip.atlanta.com;branch=z9hG4bKfjzc
       ;received=192.0.3.2
       ;spam=-100
       ;spam-detail="Jaeger-3.3;not-a-spammer=-100"

6.  Security Considerations

   SIP proxies and SIP user agents need to ignore spam scores in Via
   headers generated by proxies that aren't trusted.  Via headers have
   the most recent proxy on top, so parsing for spam scores should stop
   at the first Via header from a non-trusted proxy.
