1. Introduction

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a packet transport
   technology based on a profile of the MPLS functionality specific
   to the construction of packet-switched transport networks. 
   MPLS is described in [RFC3031] and requirements for MPLS-TP are
   specified in [RFC5654].
  
   A range of Management Information Base (MIB) modules has been
   developed to help model and manage the various aspects of
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks. These MIB modules
   are defined in separate documents that focus on the specific areas of
   responsibility of the modules that they describe.
   
   This document describes the MIB-based management architecture for
   MPLS-TP and indicates the interrelationships between the existing

draft-farrel-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-00.txt            July 2010


   MIB modules used for MPLS-TP network management. The document also
   indentifies areas where additional MIB modules would be required to
   support an MPLS-TP network.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.


2. Terminology

   This document also uses terminology from the MPLS architecture 
   document [RFC3031] and the following MPLS related MIB modules:
   MPLS TC MIB [RFC3811], MPLS LSR MIB [RFC3813], MPLS TE MIB [RFC3812],
   MPLS LDP MIB [RFC3815], MPLS FTN MIB [RFC3814] and TE LINK MIB 
   [RFC4220].
    

3. The SNMP Management Framework

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).
   
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   This document discusses MIB modules that are compliant to the SMIv2,
   which is described in [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580].


4. Summary of MPLS-TP Management Function

   The management of the MPLS-TP networks is separable from that of its
   client networks so that the same means of management can be used
   regardless of the client. The management functions of MPLS-TP 
   includes fault management, configuration management, performance
   monitoring, and security management.


5. Overview of Existing Work

   [RFC4221] describes the management architecture for MPLS. In 


Farrel & King, et al.                                           [Page 4]

draft-farrel-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-00.txt            July 2010


   particular, it describes how the managed objects defined in various
   MPLS-related MIB modules model different aspects of MPLS, as well as
   the interactions and dependencies between each of these MIB modules.
   
   [RFC4377] describes requirements for user and data plane
   Operations and Management (OAM) and applications for MPLS.  
   
   [MPLS-TP-NM-REQ] specifies the requirements for the management of 
   equipment used in networks supporting an MPLS-TP. It also details the 
   essential network management capabilities for operating networks
   consisting of MPLS-TP equipment.
   
   [MPLS-TP-NM-FRAMEWORK] provides the network management framework for 
   MPLS-TP. The document explains how network elements and networks that
   support MPLS-TP can be managed using solutions that satisfy the 
   requirements defined in [MPLS-TP-NM-REQ]. The relationship between
   MPLS-TP management and OAM is described in the MPLS-TP framework
   [MPLS-TP-NM-FRAMEWORK] document.

5.2.2. Textual Convention Modules

   MPLS-TC-STD-MIB [RFC3811]:

   MIB module which contains Textual Conventions

   for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks.  These Textual
   Conventions should be imported by MIB modules which manage MPLS
   networks.

5.2.3. Mapping Data to LSPs

   MPLS is a packet switching protocol that operates between the
   Network layer and the data link layer in the OSI model.

   There is a clean separation between the control and forwarding
   planes in the MPLS protocol. This helps in easy portability and 
   extensibility to the forwarding functionss.

   The basic unit in an MPLS network is called LSR(Label switched
   router). It implements the control and forwarding plane of MPLS.

   The control plane is responsible for exchaging routing information
   with other LSRs and use this information to program the forwarding
   tables to be used by the forwarding plane. The forwarding plane
   then uses these tables where each entry is indexed by a 20 bit label
   to forward the packet.

   Each entry in this forwarding table corresponds to a forwarding 
   equivalence class(FEC). This can be loosely defined as the set of
   characteristics that are being shared by the packets which will be
   forwarded in a similar fashion and may share the same label.

   MPLS packets are encapsulated by using its own header. This header 
   can contain one more more label entries - also referred to as the 
   label stack. Each label stack entry consists of label, 3 bits for 
   QOS, bottom of stack bit and TTL.

   The ingress and the egress devices of the MPLS network are called 
   Label Edge routers. These routers "Push" an MPLS label into an 
   incoming packet and "pop" off the MPLS label from an outgoing packet
   respectively.

   At the ingress when an unlabeled packet enters, a label is prefixed
   to this packet based on its FEC as discussed above. Then the packet
   is sent to the next-hop router for further processing. The next-hop
   router examines the topmost label in the label stack and then
   does a 'swap, 'push' or 'pop' label operations based on the contents.

   A label stack entry can be 'popped' or removed from the top of the 
   label stack or a label stack entry is 'pushed' or inserted into the
   top of the stack based on the FEC information. 

   When a 'swap' operation is executed, the topmost label stack entry is


Farrel & King, et al.                                           [Page 7]

draft-farrel-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-00.txt            July 2010


   replaced with a different one and the depth of the label stack 
   remains the same. After the swap the packet is forwarded based on the
   new entry.


5.2.4. Label Switching Router Modules

   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813]: This MIB module which describes managed
   objects for modeling a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031]
   Label Switching Router (LSR).
   
   For the support of MPLS-TP, which bears the transport characteristic,
   a multipoint-to-point cross connect should not be configured in this
   MIB module.
   
5.2.5. Label Switched Path Modules

   The path taken through the MPLS domain by a packet is referred to as
   a label switched path(LSP). It is possible that this path may not be
   understood or completely stored in one LSR within the MPLS domain.

   This label switched path can be programmed using a variety of 
   mechanisms. These include manual programming and using a signalling
   protocol.
   
   RSVP-TE(Resource reservation protocol for Traffic Engineering) is
   normally used for signalling LSPs used for Traffic Engineering. LDP
   (Label distribution protocol) is also used to signal and maintain an
   LSP with little operator intervention. 
   
   The two important applications of MPLS are : 
   
   MPLS-TE - MPLS Traffic engineering
   MPLS-VPN - MPLS Virtual Private Networks.

   In a MPLS-VPN network an operator can configure the edge devices 
   (LERs) in the MPLS network connecting to the customer network with
   the details of VPN. The rest of the MPLS configuration is transparent
   and automatic.

   MPLS-FTN-STD-MIB [RFC3814]: This MIB module describes managed objects
   for defining, configuring, and monitoring Forwarding Equivalence
   Class (FEC) to Next Hop Label Forwarding Entry (NHLFE) mappings and 
   corresponding actions for use with Multiprotocol Label Switching 
   (MPLS).

   MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB [RFC3815]: This MIB module describes managed objects
   for the Multiprotocol label Switching, Label Distribution Protocol 
   (LDP).

draft-farrel-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-00.txt            July 2010


   MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB [RFC4382]: This MIB module describes managed 
   objects to configure and/or monitor Multiprotocol Label Switching 
   Layer-3 Virtual Private Networks on a Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) Label Switching Router (LSR) supporting this feature.
   
5.2.6. Pseudowire Modules

   The PWE3 MIB modules architecture provides a layered modular model
   into which any supported emulated service can be connected to any
   supported PSN type.  This specific MIB module provides the glue for
   mapping between the emulated service onto the native PSN service. As
   such, the defining of a PW emulated service requires the use of at
   least three types of MIB modules.

   Starting from the emulated service, the first type is a service-
   specific module, which is dependent on the emulated signal type.
   These modules are defined in other documents.

   The second type is this module, the PW-STD-MIB module, which
   configures general parameters of the PW that are common to all types
   of emulated services and PSN types.

   The third type of module is a PSN-specific module.  There is a
   different module for each type of PSN.  These modules associate the
   PW with one or more "tunnels" that carry the service over the PSN.
   These modules are defined in other documents.

   PW-STD-MIB[RFC5601]: This document defines a MIB module that can be
   used to manage pseudowire (PW) services for transmission over a 
   Packet Switched Network (PSN) [RFC3931] [RFC4447].  This MIB module
   provides generic management of PWs that is common to all types of
   PSN and PW services defined by the IETF PWE3 Working Group.

   PW-MPLS-STD-MIB [RFC5602]: This document describes a model for 
   managing pseudowire services for transmission over different flavors
   of MPLS tunnels.  The general PW MIB module [RFC5601] defines the
   parameters global to the PW regardless of the underlying Packet
   Switched Network (PSN) and emulated service.  This document is
   applicable for PWs that use MPLS PSN type in the PW-STD-MIB.

   This document describes the MIB objects that define pseudowire
   association to the MPLS PSN, in a way that is not specific to the
   carried service.

   Together, [RFC3811] and [RFC3812] describe the modeling of an MPLS
   tunnel, and a tunnel's underlying cross-connects.  This MIB module
   supports MPLS-TE PSN, non-TE MPLS PSN (an outer tunnel created by the
   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) or manually), and MPLS PW label
   only (no outer tunnel).

   PW-ENET-STD-MIB[RFC5603]: This document describes a model for 
   managing Ethernet pseudowire services for transmission over a
   Packet Switched Network (PSN).  This MIB module is generic and common
   to all types of PSNs supported in the Pseudowire Emulation 
   Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architecture [RFC3985], which describes the 
   transport and encapsulation of L1 and L2 services over supported PSN
   types.

   In particular, the MIB module associates a port or specific VLANs on
   top of a physical Ethernet port or a virtual Ethernet interface (for
   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)) to a point-to-point PW.  It is
   complementary to the PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601], which manages the generic
   PW parameters common to all services, including all supported PSN
   types.

   PW-TDM-MIB [RFC5604]: This document describes a model for managing 
   TDM pseudowires, i.e., TDM data encapsulated for transmission over
   a Packet Switched Network (PSN).  The term TDM in this document is
   limited to the scope of Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH).  It
   is currently specified to carry any TDM Signals in either Structure
   Agnostic Transport mode (E1, T1, E3, and T3) or in Structure Aware
   Transport mode (E1, T1, and NxDS0) as defined in the Pseudowire
   Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) TDM Requirements document [RFC4197].

   PW-ATM-MIB[RFC5605] This document describes a model for managing 
   "emulated" ATM services over a Packet Switched Network (PSN).

   The document follows the requirements for Pseudowire Emulation Edge-
   to-Edge [RFC3916]; it is closely related to [RFC4717] and [RFC4816],
   which describe the encapsulation of ATM signals and provide the
   Emulation Service over a Packet Switched Network.

   The ATM management model consists of several MIB modules, following
   the layering model described in the PWE3 Architecture [RFC3985]
   document.  The ATM MIB module described in this document works
   closely with the MIB modules described in [RFC2514], [RFC2515], 
   [RFC2863], [RFC5601], and the textual conventions defined in 
   [RFC5542].  The conceptual layering and relationship among all of
   those is described in Figure 1 and in the "Relation to Other PW-MIB
   Modules" section listed below.  An ATM connection will be a 
   pseudowire (PW) connection.  It will not be treated as an interface
   and will therefore not be represented in the ifTable.
   
   The PWE3 MIB modules architecture provides a layered modular model
   into which any supported emulated service can be connected to any
   supported PSN type.  This specific MIB module provides the glue for
   mapping between the emulated service onto the native PSN service.  As
   such, the defining of a PW emulated service requires the use of at
   least three types of MIB modules.

Farrel & King, et al.                                          [Page 10]

   Starting from the emulated service, the first type is a service-
   specific module, which is dependent on the emulated signal type.
   These modules are defined in other documents.

   The second type is this module, the PW-STD-MIB module, which
   configures general parameters of the PW that are common to all types
   of emulated services and PSN types.

   The third type of module is a PSN-specific module.  There is a
   different module for each type of PSN.  These modules associate the
   PW with one or more "tunnels" that carry the service over the PSN.
   These modules are defined in other documents.

   PW-STD-MIB[RFC5601]: This RFC defines a MIB module that can be used
   to manage pseudowire (PW) services for transmission over a Packet
   Switched Network (PSN) [RFC3931] [RFC4447].  This MIB module provides
   generic management of PWs that is common to all types of PSN and PW
   services defined by the IETF PWE3 Working Group.

   PW-MPLS-STD-MIB [RFC5602]: This document describes a model for 
   managing pseudowire services for transmission over different flavors
   of MPLS tunnels.  The general PW MIB module [RFC5601] defines the
   parameters global to the PW regardless of the underlying Packet 
   Switched Network (PSN) and emulated service.  This document is
   applicable for PWs that use MPLS PSN type in the PW-STD-MIB.

   This document describes the MIB objects that define pseudowire
   association to the MPLS PSN, in a way that is not specific to the
   carried service.

   Together, [RFC3811] and [RFC3812] describe the modeling of an MPLS
   tunnel, and a tunnel's underlying cross-connects.  This MIB module
   supports MPLS-TE PSN, non-TE MPLS PSN (an outer tunnel created by the
   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) or manually), and MPLS PW label
   only (no outer tunnel).

   PW-ENET-STD-MIB[RFC5603]: This document describes a model for 
   managing Ethernet pseudowire services for transmission over a Packet
   Switched Network (PSN).  This MIB module is generic and common to all
   types of PSNs supported in the Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge 
   (PWE3) architecture [RFC3985], which describes the transport and
   encapsulation of L1 and L2 services over supported PSN types.

   In particular, the MIB module associates a port or specific VLANs on
   top of a physical Ethernet port or a virtual Ethernet interface (for
   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)) to a point-to-point PW.  It is
   complementary to the PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601], which manages the generic
   PW parameters common to all services, including all supported PSN
   types.

draft-farrel-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-00.txt            July 2010


   PW-TDM-MIB [RFC5604]: This document describes a model for managing 
   TDM pseudowires, i.e., TDM data encapsulated for transmission over
   a Packet Switched Network (PSN).  The term TDM in this document is
   limited to the scope of Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH).  
   It is currently specified to carry any TDM Signals in either 
   Structure Agnostic Transport mode (E1, T1, E3, and T3) or in
   Structure Aware Transport mode (E1, T1, and NxDS0) as defined in
   the Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) TDM Requirements
   document [RFC4197].

   PW-ATM-MIB[RFC5605] This document describes a model for managing
   "emulated" ATM services over a Packet Switched Network (PSN).

   The document follows the requirements for Pseudowire Emulation Edge-
   to-Edge [RFC3916]; it is closely related to [RFC4717] and [RFC4816],
   which describe the encapsulation of ATM signals and provide the
   Emulation Service over a Packet Switched Network.

   The ATM management model consists of several MIB modules, following
   the layering model described in the PWE3 Architecture [RFC3985]
   document.  The ATM MIB module described in this document works
   closely with the MIB modules described in [RFC2514], [RFC2515], 
   [RFC2863], [RFC5601], and the textual conventions defined in 
   [RFC5542]. The conceptual layering and relationship among all of 
   those is described in Figure 1 and in the "Relation to Other 
   PW-MIB Modules" section listed below.  An ATM connection will be a
   pseudowire (PW) connection.  It will not be treated as an interface
   and will therefore not be represented in the ifTable.

5.2.7. Routing and Traffic Engineering

   In MPLS traffic engineering, its possible to specify explicit routes
   or choose routes based on QOS metrics in setting up a path such that
   some specific data can be routed around network hot spots.

   MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812]:

   This MIB module describes managed objects for modeling a
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031] based traffic
   engineering.  This MIB module should be used in conjunction with the
   companion document [RFC3813] for MPLS based traffic engineering
   configuration and management.

5.2.8. Resiliency
   
5.2.9. Fault Management and Performance Management 




Farrel & King, et al.                                          [Page 12]

draft-farrel-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-00.txt            July 2010


   MPLS manages the faults through LSP ping [RFC4379], VCCV [RFC5085], 
   BFD for LSPs [RFC5884] and BFD for VCCV [RFC5885].
   The above tools mentioned do not have the MIB management model, 
   need to provide support for MPLS before considering above tools for
   MPLS-TP.
  
   As per draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-analysis-01.txt draft, there are 
   MPLS-TP OAM functions (Fault managment and Performance management)
   which need to be supported for MPLS-TP, some of the recommended OAM
   functions can be achieved through existing MPLS-OAM and some of the
   functions can be achieved using the extension of existing tools. More
   information on the MIBs of MPLS-TP OAM can be found in the section 
   6.1 Gap analysis. 

5.2.10. MIB Module Interdependencies

   This section provides an overview of the relationship between the
   MPLS MIB modules for MPLS-TP MIB. More details of these relationships 
   are given below.
   
   The arrows in the following diagram show a 'depends on' relationship.
   A relationship "MIB module A depends on MIB module B" means that MIB
   module A uses an object, object identifier, or textual convention
   defined in MIB module B, or that MIB module A contains a pointer
   (index or RowPointer) to an object in MIB module B.

  Thus:

   -  All the MPLS MIB modules depend on MPLS-TC-STD-MIB.
   
   -  All the GMPLS MIB modules depend on GMPLS-TC-STD-MIB.
   
   -  All the PW MIB modules depend on PW-TC-STD-MIB.

   -  MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB, MPLS-TE-STD-MIB, MPLS-FTN-STD-MIB, 
      GMPLS-LSR-STD-MIB, and PW-MPLS-STD-MIB contain references to 
      objects in MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB.

   -  MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-STD-MIB contains references to objects in 
      MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB.

   -  GMPLS-LSR-STD-MIB contains references to objects in 
      GMPLS-LABEL-STD-MIB. 

   Note that there is a textual convention (MplsIndexType) defined in
   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB that is imported by MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB.

5.2.11. Dependencies on External MIB Modules

   In addition to the MPLS management overview [RFC4221] 
   section 4.12 (Dependencies on External MIB Modules), some of the 
   existing MPLS MIBs, PW MIBs and GMPLS MIBs are re-used with 
   extensions for achieving the MPLS-TP functionality.

   MPLS MIB modules have dependencies with the TE-LINK-STD-MIB 
   for maintaining the traffic engineering informations.

   MPLS MIB modules depend on the CSPF module to get the paths for MPLS
   tunnel to traverse to reach the end point of the tunnel and BFD 
   module to verify the data-plane failures of LSPs and PWs.

   Finally, all of the MIB modules import standard textual conventions
   such as integers, strings, timestamps, etc., from the MIB modules in
   which they are defined.
    
   This is business as usual for a MIB module and is not discussed 
   further in this document.  

6. Applicability of MPLS MIB modules to MPLS-TP
   
   This section provides the information about the extensions of 
   existing MPLS MIB modules for MPLS-TP and the new MPLS-TP MIB
   modules.

6.1.1 MPLS-TP Tunnel
   
   MPLS-TP tunnel table MPLSTP-STD-MIB is an extension of 
   MPLS tunnel table [RFC4221] to support MPLS-TP requirements. 
   Tunnel identifiers are defined based on [MPLS-TP-IDENTIFIERS].

6.1.2 MPLS-TP Pseudowire

   MPLS-TP Pseudowire table MPLSTP-STD-MIB is an extension of 
   Pseudowire table MPLS-PW-STD-MIB to support MPLS-TP requirements.
   Pseudowire identifiers are defined based on [MPLS-TP-IDENTIFIERS].

6.1.3 MPLS-TP Sections

   This section needs to be updated with the section layer network 
   managed objects based on the draft-ietf-mpls-tp-data-plane-04.txt
   (Section 3.2.) draft.

6.1.4 MPLS-TP OAM

   MPLS-LSP-PING-STD-MIB describes managed objects used to model and 
   manage the MPLS LSP ping [RFC4379]. LSP ping is used for 
   connectivity verification and fault isolation in an MPLS LSPs. 

   PW-VCCV-STD-MIB describes managed objects used to model and manage 
   the VCCV [RFC5085]. VCCV used for end-to-end fault detection and 
   diagnostics for a Pseudowire. 

   BFD-MPLS-STD-MIB describes the managed objects for modeling the 
   BFD for MPLS LSPs [RFC5884]. BFD for LSPs used for detecting 
   MPLS LSP data plane failures. 
  
   BFD-PW-VCCV-STD-MIB describes the managed objects for modeling  
   the BFD for Pseudowires [RFC5885]. BFD for Pseudowires used for
   detecting data plane failures. 
   
   MPLS-LSP-PING-STD-MIB, PW-VCCV-STD-MIB, BFD-MPLS-STD-MIB and 
   BFD-PW-VCCV-STD-MIB are newly defined for MPLS. The new MPLS-TP 
   managed objects for LSP ping and BFD are based on 
   draft-ietf-mpls-tp-lsp-ping-bfd-procedures-00.
   
   All MPLS-TP managed for OAM is defined in the MPLSTP-OAM-STD-MIB.

   MPLSTP-TC-STD-MIB describes the textual conventions used for MPLS-TP.

   MPLSTP-STD-MIB describes managed objects used to model and manage 
   the new extensions for LSPs, section and Pseudowires for IP and 
   non-IP packet based MPLS-TP transport networks.

   The MPLS-TP OAM functionalities Continuity Check and Connectivity 
   Verification, Alarm Reporting, Diagnostic, Route Tracing, Loopback 
   tool, Lock Instruct, Lock Reporting Remote Defect Indication, Client
   Failure Indication, Packet Loss Measurement, Packet Delay Measurement
   can be achieved using the MPLSTP-OAM-STD-MIB mib extensions. MPLS-TP


Farrel & King, et al.                                          [Page 16]

draft-farrel-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-00.txt            July 2010


   OAM managed objects are defined based on the drafts 
   draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements-06, 
   draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework-06 and 
   draft-ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers-01. 

6.1.5 MPLS-TP Protection Switching

   An important aspect that MPLS-TP technology provides is protection
   switching. In general, the mechanism of protection switching 
   can be described as the substitution of a protection or standby 
   facility for a working or primary facility. An MPLS-TP protection
   switching can be managed with the following parameters:
   
   o Topology (linear, ring, mesh)
   o Protection architecture (1+1, 1:1, or others as defined in 
     different topologies)
   o Switching type (unidirectional, bidirectional)
   o Operation mode (revertive, non-revertive)
   o Automatic protection channel
   o Protection state
   o Position of the switch
   o Timer values (hold-off, Wait-to-Restore)
   o Failure of protocol

   Among those parameters for protection switching, the topology on 
   that a  protection switching applies has the most significant 
   influence on the other parameters. Besides, the mechanism of a 
   particular protection switching heavily depends on its topology. 
   Therefore, three MIB modules are to be defined to model and 
   manage each of three different topologies protection switching.

   MPLSTP-LPS-STD-MIB describes managed objects used to model and 
   manage the linear protection switching.
   
   MPLSTP-RPS-STD-MIB describes managed objects used to model and
   manage the ring protection switching.
   
   MPLSTP-MPS-STD-MIB describes managed objects used to model and
   manage the mesh protection switching.

6.1.6 MIB Module Interdependencies
   
   This section provides an overview of the relationship between 
   the MPLS-TP MIB modules. More details of these relationships 
   are given below.
   
   The arrows in the following diagram show a 'depends on' 
   relationship. A relationship "MIB module A depends on MIB module

   textual convention defined in MIB module B, or that MIB module A
   contains a pointer (index or RowPointer) to an object in MIB 
   module B.

  Thus:

   -  All the MPLS-TP MIB modules depend on MPLSTP-TC-STD-MIB.
   
   -  MPLSTP-OAM-STD-MIB and MPLSTP-PS-STD-MIB contain references to
      objects in MPLSTP-STD-MIB.

   -  MPLSTP-PS-STD-MIB contains references to objects in 
      MPLSTP-OAM-STD-MIB.

   -  MPLSTP-STD-MIB contains references to objects in 
      MPLS-TE-STD-MIB and PW-STD-MIB.
  
   -  MPLSTP-OAM-STD-MIB contains references to objects in 
      MPLS-LSP-PING-STD-MIB, and
      PW-VCCV-STD-MIB and BFD-MPLS-STD-MIB.

9. Security Considerations

   This document describes the interrelationships amongst the different
   MIB modules relevant to MPLS-TP management and as such does not have
   any security implications in and of itself.

   Each IETF MIB document that specifies MIB objects for MPLS-TP must
   provide a proper security considerations section that explains the
   security aspects of those objects.

   The attention of readers is particularly drawn to the security
   implications of making MIB objects available for create or write
   access through an access protocol such as SNMP.  SNMPv1 by itself is
   an insecure environment.  Even if the network itself is made secure
   (for example, by using IPSec), there is no control over who on the
   secure network is allowed to access and GET (read) the objects in
   this MIB.  It is recommended that the implementers consider the
   security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,
   the use of the User-based Security Model STD 62, RFC 3414 [RFC3414],
   and the View-based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415],
   is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of each MIB module is properly
   configured to give access to only those objects, and to those
   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
