Abstract

   In order to derive a Domain-Specific Root Key (DSRK) from the
   Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) generated as a side-effect of an
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method, the EAP peer must
   discover the name of the domain to which it is attached.

   This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Version
   6 (DHCPv6) option designed to allow a DHCPv6 server to inform clients
   of the name of the local domain..

Internet-Draft     The Local Domain Name DHCPv6 Option    September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) [RFC5296] is designed to
   allow faster re-authentication of a mobile device which was
   previously authenticated by means of the Extensible Authentication
   Protocol [RFC3748].  Given that the local root key (e.g., DSRK RFC
   5295 [RFC5295]) is generated using the local domain name (LDN), LDN
   discovery is an important part of re-authentication.  As described in
   RFC 5296 [RFC5296], the local domain name can be learned by the
   mobile device through the ERP exchange or via a lower-layer
   mechanism.  However, no lower-layer mechanisms for LDN discovery have
   yet been defined.

   This document specifies an extension to DHCPv6 for local domain name
   discovery.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Option Format

   In DHCPv6-based local domain name discovery, the LDN option is used
   by the DHCPv6 client to obtain the local domain name from the DHCPv6
   Server after full EAP authentication has taken place.

3.1.  DHCPv6 Local Domain Name Option

   The format of this option is:

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | OPTION_LOCAL_DOMAIN_NAME    |         option-length         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | local-domain-name...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   option code
      OPTION_LOCAL_DOMAIN_NAME (TBD)

   option-length
      Length of the local-domain-name field, in octets

Internet-Draft     The Local Domain Name DHCPv6 Option    September 2010


   local-domain-name
      This field contains the name of the local domain and MUST be
      encoded as specified in Section 8 of RFC 3315 [RFC3315].

4.  Client Behavior

   If a DHCPv6 client doesn't know the local domain name and requires
   the DHCPv6 Server to provide the DHCPv6 LDN option, it MUST include
   an Option Request option requesting the DHCPv6 LDN option, as
   described in Section 22.7 of RFC 3315 [RFC3315].

   When the DHCPv6 client recieves a LDN option with the local domain
   name present in it, it MUST verify that the option length is no more
   than 256 octets (the maximum length of a single FQDN allowed by DNS),
   and that the local domain name is a properly encoded single FQDN, as
   specified in Section 8, "Representation and Use of Domain Names" of
   RFC3315 [RFC3315].

5.  Relay Agent Behavior

   If a DHCPv6 relay agent has pre-existing knowledge of the local
   domain name (for example, from a previous AAA exchange), it SHOULD
   include it in an instance of the DHCPv6 LDN option and forward to the
   DHPv6 server as a suboption of the Relay-Supplied Options option
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-relay-supplied-options].

6.  Server Behavior

   If the option code for the LDN option is included in an Option
   Request option, the server SHOULD return the DHCPv6 LDN option to the
   client.

7.  Security Considerations

   The communication between the DHCPv6 client and the DHCPv6 server for
   the exchange of local domain name information is security sensitive
   and requires authentication, integrity and replay protection.  DHCPv6
   security [RFC3315] can be used for this purpose.

8.  IANA considerations

   IANA is requested to assign one new option code from the registry of
   DHCP Option Codes maintained at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters, referencing this
   document.
