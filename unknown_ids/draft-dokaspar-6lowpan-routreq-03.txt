Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements      November 2007


1.  Problem Statement

   Low-power wireless personal area networks (LoWPANs) are formed by
   devices complying to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard [7].  LoWPAN devices
   are distinguished by their low bandwidth, short range, scarce memory
   capacity, limited processing capability and other attributes of
   inexpensive hardware.  In this document, the characteristics of nodes
   participating in LoWPANs are assumed to be those described in [5].

   IEEE 802.15.4 networks support star and mesh topologies and consist
   of two different device types: reduced-function devices (RFDs) and
   full-function devices (FFDs).  RFDs have the most limited
   capabilities and are intended to perform only simple and basic tasks.
   RFDs may only associate with a single FFD at a time, but FFDs may
   form arbitrary topologies and accomplish more advanced functions,
   such as multi-hop routing.

   However, neither the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the 6LoWPAN format
   specification ("IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4" [6]) specify how mesh
   topologies could be obtained and maintained.  Routing in mesh
   networks has been the subject of much research.  Also in the IETF, a
   number of experimental protocols have been developed in the Mobile
   Ad-hoc Networks (MANET) working group, such as AODV [2], OLSR [3], or
   DYMO [11].  However, the modification/simplification of these
   existing routing protocols may be required for mesh routing to be
   feasible in a LoWPAN domain, for the following reasons:

   o  A possibly simpler routing problem, because LoWPANs are not
      transit networks.

   o  The more stringent requirements that apply to LoWPANs as opposed
      to high performance and non-battery-operated networks.  LoWPAN
      nodes are characterized by small memory sizes, low processing
      power, and are running on very limited power supplied by primary
      non-rechargeable batteries.  A node's lifetime is usually defined
      by the lifetime of its battery.

   This creates new challenges on obtaining robust and reliable mesh
   routing within LoWPANs.

   Using the 6LoWPAN header format, there are two layers routing
   protocols can be defined at, commonly referred to as "mesh-under" and
   "route-over".  The mesh-under approach supports routing under the IP
   link and is directly based on the link-layer IEEE 802.15.4 standard,
   therefore using (64-bit or 16-bit short) MAC addresses.  On the other
   hand, the route-over approach relies on IP routing and therefore
   supports routing over possibly various types of interconnected links
   (see also Figure 1).

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements      November 2007


   Most statements in this draft apply to both the mesh-under and route-
   over cases.

   The 6LoWPAN problem statement document ("6LoWPAN Problems and Goals"
   [5]) briefly mentions four requirements on routing protocols;

      (a) low overhead on data packets

      (b) low routing overhead

      (c) minimal memory and computation requirements

      (d) support for sleeping nodes considering battery saving

   These four high-level requirements only describe the need for low
   overhead and power saving.  But, based on the fundamental features of
   LoWPAN, more detailed routing requirements are presented in this
   document, which can lead to further analysis and protocol design.

   In summary, the main problems of mesh routing in LoWPANs are:

   1.  Existing routing solutions do not operate in 6LoWPAN's adaptation
       layer (and do not support the addressing scheme defined by IEEE
       802.15.4).  If a routing protocol for 6LoWPAN is designed to run
       in the IP layer, it should be adapted to meet the 6LoWPAN-
       specific requirements.  It must be evaluated which layer is most
       suitable for 6LoWPAN routing.

   2.  The precise 6LoWPAN routing requirements must be defined.

   3.  It needs to be clarified how existing routing solutions can be
       adapted to meet the low-power requirements presented in
       Section 4.

   Considering the problems above, this draft addresses mesh routing
   requirements for 6LoWPANs for both mesh-under and route-over routing
   protocol design.

2.  Design Space

   Apart from a wide variety of routing algorithms possible for 6LoWPAN,
   the question remains as to whether routing should be performed mesh-
   under (in the adaptation layer defined by the 6lowpan format document
   [6]), or in the IP-layer using a route-over approach.  The most
   significant consequence of mesh-under routing is that routing would
   be directly based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, therefore using (64-
   bit or 16-bit shortened) MAC addresses instead of IP addresses, and a
   LoWPAN would be seen as a single IP link.  In case a route-over
   mechanism is to be applied to a LoWPAN it must also support 6LoWPAN's
   unique properties using global IPv6 addressing.

   Additionally, because of the low-performance characteristics of
   LoWPANs, a light-weight routing protocol must be produced that meets
   the design goals and requirements presented in this document.

   Figure 1 shows the place of 6LoWPAN mesh routing in the entire
   network stack;

   In order to avoid packet fragmentation and the overhead for
   reassembly, routing packets should fit into a single IEEE 802.15.4
   physical frame and application data should not be expanded to an
   extent that they no longer fit.

   If a mesh-under routing protocol is built for operation in 6LoWPAN's
   adaptation layer, routing control packets are placed after the
   6LoWPAN Dispatch.  Multiple routing protocols can be supported by the
   usage of different Dispatch bit sequences.  When a route-over
   protocol is built in the IPv6 layer, the Dispatch value can be chosen

3.  Scenario Considerations

   IP-based low-power WPAN technology is still in its early stage of
   development, but the range of conceivable usage scenarios is
   tremendous.  The numerous possible applications of sensor networks
   make it obvious that mesh topologies will be prevalent in LoWPAN
   environments and routing will be a necessity for expedient
   communication.  Research efforts in the area of sensor networking
   have put forth a large variety of multi-hop routing algorithms [8].
   Most related work focuses on optimizing routing for specific
   application scenarios, which can largely be categorized into the
   following models of communication:

   o  Flooding (in very small networks)

   o  Data-aware routing (dissemination vs. gathering)

   o  Event-driven vs. query-based routing

   o  Geographic routing

   Depending on the topology of a LoWPAN and the application(s) running
   over it, these different types of routing may be used.  However, this
   draft abstracts from application-specific communication and describes
   general routing requirements valid for any type of routing in
   LoWPANs.

   The following parameters can be used to describe specific scenarios
   in which the candidate routing protocols could be evaluated.

   a.  Network Properties:

       *  Device Number, Density and Network Diameter:
          These parameters usually affect the routing state directly
          (e.g. the number of entries in a routing table or neighbor
          list).  Especially in large and dense networks, policies must
          be applied for discarding "low-quality" routing entries in
          order to prevent memory overflow.

       *  Connectivity:
          Due to external factors or programmed disconnections, a LoWPAN
          can be in several states of connectivity; anything in the
          range from "always connected" to "rarely connected".  This
          poses great challenges to the dynamic discovery of routes
          across a LoWPAN.

       *  Dynamicity (incl. mobility):
          Location changes can be induced by unpredictable external



Kaspar, et al.            Expires May 22, 2008                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements      November 2007


          factors or by controlled motion, which may in turn cause route
          changes.  Also, nodes may dynamically be introduced into a
          LoWPAN and removed from it later.  The routing state and the
          volume of control messages is heavily dependent on the number
          of moving nodes in a LoWPAN and their speed.

       *  Deployment:
          In a LoWPAN, it is possible for nodes to be scattered randomly
          or to be deployed in an organized manner.  The deployment can
          occur at once, or as an iterative process, which may also
          affect the routing state.

       *  Traffic Patterns, Topology and Applications:
          The design of a LoWPAN and the requirements on its application
          have a big impact on the most efficient routing type to be
          used.  For different traffic patterns (point-to-point,
          multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint) and network
          architectures, various routing mechanisms have been
          introduced, such as data-aware, event-driven, address-centric,
          and geographic routing.

       *  Quality of Service (QoS):
          For mission-critical applications, support of QoS is mandatory
          in resource-constrained LoWPANs and cannot be achieved without
          a certain degree of control message overhead.

       *  Security:
          LoWPANs may carry sensitive information and require a high
          level of security support where the availability, integrity,
          and confidentiality of data are primordial.  Secured messages
          cause overhead and affect the power consumption of LoWPAN
          routing protocols.

   b.  Node Parameters:

       *  Processing Speed and Memory Size:
          These basic parameters define the maximum size of the routing
          state.  LoWPAN nodes may have different performance
          characteristics beyond the common RFD/FFD distinction.

       *  Power Consumption and Power Source:
          The number and topology of battery- and mains-powered nodes in
          a LoWPAN affect routing protocols in their selection of
          optimal paths for network lifetime maximization.

       *  Transmission Range, Rate and Bandwidth:
          These parameters indirectly affect routing.  For example, a
          high transmission range may cause a dense network, which in

          turn results in more direct neighbors of a node and a larger
          routing state.

4.  6LoWPAN Routing Requirements

   This section defines a list of requirements for 6LoWPAN routing.  The
   two most important design properties, unique to low-power networks
   are

   o  Power conservation: some devices are mains-powered, but most are
      battery-operated and need to last several months to a few years
      with a single AA battery.  Many devices are mains-powered most of
      the time, but still need to function for possible extended periods
      from batteries (e.g. before building power is switched on for the
      first time).

   o  Low performance: tiny devices, memory sizes, processors, low
      bandwidth, high loss rates, etc.

   These fundamental features of LoWPANs affect the design of routing
   solutions, so that existing routing specifications should be
   simplified and modified to the smallest extent possible, in order to
   fit the low-power requirements of LoWPANs, meeting the following
   requirements:

4.1.  General Routing Requirements

   The general objectives listed in this subsection should be followed
   by 6LoWPAN routing protocols:

   [R01] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be simple and of low
   computational complexity.

      A LoWPAN routing protocol should be designed to minimize the
      required memory size, computational and algorithmical complexity.
      A routing protocol of low complexity helps to achieve the goal of
      reducing power consumption, improves robustness, is more easy to
      analyze, and is implicitly less prone to security attacks.

   [R02] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD have a low routing state.

      Operation with low routing state (such as routing tables and
      neighbor lists) SHOULD be maintained.  For example, devices may
      have only 32 forwarding entries available.  A LoWPAN routing
      protocol solution should consider the limited memory size
      (typically starting at 4K bytes) and computation capabilities of
      participating devices; due to these hardware restrictions, code
      length should be considered to fit within a small memory size.

   [R03] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be loop-free.




Kaspar, et al.            Expires May 22, 2008                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements      November 2007


      No matter whether a solution is mesh-under or route-over, 6LoWPAN
      routing protocols SHOULD consider a cost-effective loop-free
      mechanism.

   [R04] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be robust to dynamic loss
   rates.

      An important trait of LoWPAN devices is their unreliability due to
      limited system capabilities, and also because they might be
      closely coupled to the physical world with all its unpredictable
      variation, noise, and asynchrony.  It is predicted that LoWPANs
      will be comprised of significantly higher numbers of devices than
      counted in current networks, causing user interaction and
      maintenance to become impractical and therefore requiring
      robustness and self-healing capabilities in their fundamental
      network structure.  The design of mesh routing protocols must
      consider the fact that packets are to be delivered with reasonable
      probability despite unreliable and unresponsive nodes.

   [R05] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD allow for dynamically adaptive
   topologies and mobile nodes.

      There are several challenges that should be addressed by a 6LoWPAN
      routing protocol in order to create robust routing in dynamic
      environments:

      *  Mobile nodes changing their location inside a LoWPAN.

      *  Movement of a LoWPAN with respect to other (inter)connected
         LoWPANs.

      *  Nodes permanently joining or leaving the LoWPAN.

      *  Nodes appearing and disappearing in the network due to changes
         in the physical environment.

      When supporting dynamic topologies and mobile nodes, route
      maintenance should be managed by keeping in mind the goal of a
      minimal routing state.

   [R06] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be scalable.

      A LoWPAN may consist of just a couple of nodes (for instance in a
      body-area network), but may expand to much higher numbers of
      devices (e.g. monitoring of large buildings).  It is therefore
      necessary that routing mechanisms are designed to be scalable for
      operation in various network sizes.  However, due to a lack of
      memory size and computational power, 6LoWPAN routing might limit



Kaspar, et al.            Expires May 22, 2008                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements      November 2007


      forwarding entries to a small number, such as 32 routing table
      entries.  Routing protocols should be designed to achieve both
      scalability and minimality in terms of used system resources.

   [R07] 6LoWPAN protocol control messages SHOULD be secured.

      Security threats within LoWPANs may be different from existing
      threat models in ad-hoc network environments.  Neighbor Discovery
      in IEEE 802.15.4 links may be susceptible to threats as listed in
      RFC3756 [4].  Bootstrapping may also impose additional threats.
      Security is also very important for designing robust routing
      protocols, but it should not cause significant transmission
      overhead.

4.2.  6LoWPAN-specific Requirements

   [R08] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD cause minimal power
   consumption, both in the efficient use of control packet and also in
   the process of packet forwarding after route establishment.

      Saving energy is crucially important to LoWPAN devices that are
      not mains-powered but have to rely on a depleting source, such as
      a battery.  The lifetime of a LoWPAN node depends on the energy it
      can store and harvest.  Routing protocol design for 6LoWPAN should
      consider IEEE 802.15.4 link layer feedback on energy consumption.
      Power-aware routing is a non-trivial task, because it is affected
      by many mutually conflicting goals;

      *  Minimization of total energy consumed in the network

      *  Maximization of the time until a network partition occurs

      *  Minimizing the energy variance at each node

      *  Minimizing the cost per packet

      Compared to functions such as computational operations or taking
      sensor samples, radio communications is by far the dominant factor
      of power consumption [12].  One way of battery lifetime
      optimization is by achieving a minimal control message overhead.

   [R09] 6LoWPAN routing protocol control messages SHOULD not create
   fragmentation of physical layer (PHY) frames.

      In order to save energy, routing overhead should be minimized in
      order to prevent fragmentation of frames on the physical layer
      (PHY).  Therefore, 6LoWPAN routing should not cause packets to
      exceed the IEEE 802.25.4 frame size.  This both reduces the energy

Internet-Draft      6LoWPAN Mesh Routing Requirements      November 2007


      required for transmission and prevents the need for packet
      reassembly.

   [R10] Neighbor discovery for 6LoWPAN routing SHOULD be energy-
   efficient.

      Neighbor discovery is a major precondition to allow routing in a
      network.  Especially in a low-power environment, where nodes might
      be in periodic sleeping states, it is difficult to define whether
      a node is a neighbor of another or not.  Mesh-under neighbor
      discovery for 6LoWPANs is currently still in progress and
      described more detailed in [10].  In case of a route-over
      protocol, IPv6 neighbor discovery should be operated energy-
      efficiently.

   [R11] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be reliable despite
   unresponsive nodes.

      Many nodes in LoWPAN environments might periodically hibernate
      (i.e. disable their transceiver activity) in order to save energy.
      Therefore, mesh routing protocols must ensure robust packet
      delivery despite nodes frequently shutting off their radio
      transmission interface.  Feedback from the lower IEEE 802.15.4
      layer may be considered to enhance the power-awareness of 6LoWPAN
      routing protocols.

4.3.  Technical Approaches

   Routing protocols that address the above mentioned requirements in a
   generic way without making use of the points below may still be
   suboptimal.  The following reminders describe several technical ways
   the above stated requirements can be achieved.

   [T01] For neighbor discovery, 6LoWPAN devices SHOULD avoid sending
   "Hello" messages.  Instead, link-layer mechanisms (such as
   acknowledgments or beacon responses) MAY be utilized to keep track of
   active neighbors.

   [T02] The procedure of local repair and related control messages for
   intermediate nodes MAY be omitted.  In order to find energy-optimal
   routing paths, LoWPAN mesh routing protocols should minimize power
   consumption by utilizing a combination of the link quality indication
   (LQI) provided by the MAC layer and other measures, such as hop
   count.  Route repair and route error messages should be avoided for
   minimizing the overall number of control messages and the required
   energy for sending them.

   [T03] One method for estimating the reliability of a node is to use

   the link quality indication (LQI) provided by the MAC layer in
   combination with other metrics.

   [T04] In case a routing protocol operates in 6LoWPAN's adaptation
   layer, then routing tables and neighbor lists SHOULD support 16-bit
   short and 64-bit extended addresses.
