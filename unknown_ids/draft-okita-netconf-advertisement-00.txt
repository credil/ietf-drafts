Abstract

   This memo describes a configuration interface advertisement method
   for NETCONF device developers.  In the proposal, the developers take
   a configuration interface definition information of target NETCONF
   devices.  On their development environment, they generate stab
   classes to control the devices.  The NETCONF device advertises their
   configuration interface by a WSDL file.  The WSDL file describes
   message type of each NETCONF operation of the device.  The WSDL file
   contains XML Schema in its types element and describes definition of
   the types definition used to configuration data.  By this
   configuration interface advertisement, Network management System
   (NMS) developers can improve their development efficiency of the NMS.

1.  Introduction

   IETF netconf WG made up NETCONF protocol [1] , standard configuration
   protocol between a network management system and network devices.  By
   using this unified management/configuration protocol, operators can
   reduce management/configuration cost.  Developers of the network
   management system (NMS) read configuration interface definition
   document and write code that accesses the configuration interface of
   the NETCONF device.

   Now, there are no standard way to take XML Schema [11] from a target
   NETCONF device.  To implement the NETCONF NMS, the developers should
   check the Schema that defines the configuration data of the target
   NETCONF device.  They should know XML tree construction of the
   configuration data and type definition of the each element in the XML
   tree.

   This document provides the requirements to NETCONF devices and the
   programming model to suppress the implementation cost of the NMS that
   manages NETCONF devices.

   First, this document standardizes how to describe the configuration
   interface of NETCONF devices.  Second, this document standardizes how
   to describe the type definition of the XML elements that occur in the
   NETCONF protocol messages.  Last, this document standardizes how to
   advertise the above configuration interface definition information.

   This document also describe how NETCONF NMS developers automeate the
   construction of NETCONF stack during the development of a NETCONF
   NMS.

2.  NETCONF Protocol

   Characteristics of the NETCONF protocol are (1) XML-format, (2) RPC-
   style, and (3) separation of operation and datamodel.

   The NETCONF protocol has protocol messages described in XML [13]
   format.  XML-format makes it easy for operators to read configuration
   data.  It also improves machine readability of the configuration data
   since XML documents are well-formed.  From a different viewpoint,
   various XML related tools eases development of devices compliant to
   the NETCONF protocol.

   The NETCONF protocol is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) style protocol.
   RPC-style protocols have sets of a request message and a
   corresponding reply message.  It is easy to implement on a management
   software, since each RPC of the protocol corresponds to a function
   call of the programs.

                                 Figure 1

   The NETCONF protocol defines protocol operations and datamodels
   separately.  The NETCONF protocol has four layers.  Figure 1 shows
   the NETCONF protocol structure.  It contains Transport Protocol
   Layer, RPC Layer, Operations Layer and Content Layer.

   In the RPC Layer and Operations Layer, the netconf WG defined RPC
   message and basic protocol operations [1] .  These NETCONF operations
   carry configuration data inside <config> element.  The WG also

   defined the transport mapping of the NETCONF protocol for SSH [2] ,
   SOAP/HTTP [3] and BEEP [4] .

   The Content Layer defines model of the NETCONF content carried by
   NETCONF operations such as <get-config> and <edit-config>.  The
   structure of the configuration data is defined by schema language
   such as DTD [10] , XML Schema [11] or RelaxNG for the each model.

3.  Proposal

   To fulfill the above requirements, we propose adoption of Web-Service
   architecture to the NETCONF system architecture.  The proposed
   NETCONF system uses Web Service Description Language (WSDL) [14] and
   XML Schema (XSD) widely deployed in Web-service system.

   Features of this proposal:

      WSDL for interface advertisement

      XSD for type definition

      HTTP access to the WSDL file with fixed URL

3.1.  Target Architecture

   This proposal assumes the following NETCONF system architecture.
   Developers implement their NMS as a NETCONF manager on their
   development environment with help of the NETCONF configuration
   interface information provided by NETCONF device developers via the
   direct access to the NETCONF device or via indirect access with Web
   server.  The implemented NMS works on a runtime environment and
   access NETCONF devices via NETCONF protocol.

      NETCONF Device

      Development Environment NETCONF Manager

      Runtime Environment NETCONF Manager

      Device vendor's Web server

3.2.  NETCONF Operation Interface Advertisement by WSDL

   NETCONF devices advertise their configuration interface to the
   NETCONF NMS developers.  The developers know name of the operation,
   number and type of arguments, and type of return value from the
   interface advertisement.

   In this proposal, NETCONF system use WSDL file to advertise their
   configuration interface to the NMS developers.  Somehow the NMS
   developers takes a WSDL file corresponding to a target NETCONF
   device, and read the WSDL file.  Then the developers know NETCONF
   operations implemented in the NETCONF device.

   The WSDL file SHOULD include two ordinary NETCONF protocol message
   exchanges: hello exchange and RPC exchange.  In the hello exchange, a

Internet-Draft       NETCONF Interface Advertisement       November 2007


   NETCONF Manager throw <hello> element to a NETCONF devices a NETCONF
   request, and then get <hello> element from the NETCONF device as a
   NETCONF response.  In the RPC exchange, the NETCONF manager throw
   <rpc> element and get <rpc-reply> element.

   Below is a recommended WSDL file example to advertise NETCONF device
   configuration interface proposed in RFC4743[3].  In this example,
   SOAP over HTTP is selected as its transport protocol binding.
   NETCONF device developers can choose their favorite transport binding
   and modify the binding part of this WSDL file.

   The WSDL file describes type definition of the argument and return
   value of each operation by XML Schema.  Developers MAY prepare
   external XML Schema as separate file or inline Schema in this WSDL
   file.  In this example, an external XML Schema defines the types.
   When developers prepare inline schema, they make types element under
   the definition element of this WSDL file and place schema element
   same with external schema under the types element.

          </port>
        </service>

     </definitions>


   When device developers choose SOAP over HTTP binding for the NETCONF
   configuration service, the WSDL file should select "document-literal"
   as its transport binding and message encoding.  In the WSDL file,

   style attribute of the binding element SHOULD be "document". input
   and output element in binding element SHOULD include body element
   that has attribute with "literal" value.

3.3.  Operation and Datamodel Type Definition Advertisement by XSD

   The NETCONF system should prepare XML Schema describing the type of
   argument and return value of rpc request.  As described above, a WSDL
   file describes interface of a NETCONF device.  In addition to the
   interface, the NETCONF device should advertise the type definition.

   The XSD file SHOULD include ordinary NETCONF operations described in
   NETCONF Protocol [1] as the argument of rpc operation defined in the
   above WSDL file.  The XSD file MAY also include NETCONF notification
   subscription operation described in NETCONF Notification [2].  The
   XSD file MAY also include additional NETCONF operations added by
   vendors.

   Ordinary NETCONF operations:

      get

      getConfig

      editConfig

      lock

      unlock

      subscribe

   NETCONF device developers can add configuration datamodel as
   additional type definition in this XSD file.  They can add import
   element for the pointer to an external schema defining configuration
   item elements, for example, interfaceType, vlanType, and etc.  They
   can use proposed configuration datamodels like VLAN datamodel [6],
   Diff-Serv datamodel [7], and ACL datamodel [8].  They can also
   include these type definitions as an inline schema in this XSD file.

   Following describes an example XML Schema advertising the type
   definition of the NETCONF operation messages.  It contains following
   type definitions as an example.  This XML Schema contains types for
   edit-config operation message, interface configuration message, and
   vlan configuration message.  The two types are described by inline
   schema.

3.4.  Publishment of WSDL and XSD by HTTP

   NETCONF device developers can publish their WSDL and XSD by several
   methods as described below.

      HTTP server on the target NETCONF device

Internet-Draft       NETCONF Interface Advertisement       November 2007


      HTTP server on the vendor's Web site.

      FTP server on the target NETCONF device

      Manual for NMS developers

   When they publish their WSDL and XSD file by HTTP server on the
   device or their Web site, they can use several methods to advertise
   URL of the WSDL file for NMS developers as described below.

      Manual for NMS developers

      Inline retrieval operation

      Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI)

   To publish a WSDL file of a NETCONF device, the NETCONF device SHOULD
   publish it by HTTP.  The device MAY use FTP server or text on the
   developer's manual.

   If the NETCONF device publish its WSDL file by HTTP, its URL takes
   following form.  The URL SHOULD contains string "http://", IP
   address, port number followed by a slash and "netconf.wsdl".  The IP
   address in the URL is an IP address of a management interface of the
   target NETCONF device.  If the port number is not 80, they should
   wrote down the appropriate port number in a user's manual.

   http://127.0.0.1:8080/netconf.wsdl

3.5.  Reference Programming Model with Web-Service Middleware

   When a NETCONF device support NETCONF over SOAP and publish its WSDL,
   NMS developers can reduce much of their implementation time.  They
   can utilize Web-Service middleware to construct their NMS code.

   From the WSDL file published by the NETCONF device, the Web-Service
   middleware generate automatically stub classes for NMS code to access
   configuration interface of the NETCONF device via SOAP over HTTP
   transport.  The NMS developers have only to implement NMS logic using
   the stub classes.

   Using WSDL and Web-Service middleware, NMS developers might follow
   the sequence described below.

      prepare a NETCONF device

      take a WSDL file from the device via HTTP
