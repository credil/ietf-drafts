Abstract

   This MIB module defines textual conventions to represent
   Facility and Severity information commonly used in syslog messages.
   The intent is that these textual conventions will be imported and
   used in MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
   representations.

Internet Draft                syslogMIB-TC                 November 2007


1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2. Background

   Operating systems, processes and applications, collectively termed
   "facilities" in the following, generate messages indicating their own
   status or the occurrence of events. These messages have come to be
   known as syslog messages. A syslog message in general will contain
   among other things a code representing the Facility that generated
   the message and a code representing the Severity of the message. The
   Facility and the Severity codes are commonly used to categorize and
   select received syslog messages for processing and display. The
   Facility codes have been useful in qualifying the originator of the
   content of the messages but in some cases they are not specific
   enough to explicitly identify the originator. Implementations of the
   syslog protocol [RFCPROT] that contain Structured Data Elements
   (SDEs) should use these SDEs to clarify the entity that originated
   the content of the message.

   This document defines a set of textual conventions (TCs) that can be
   used to represent Facility and Severity codes commonly used in syslog
   messages.

   For interoperability and backwards compatibility reasons, the mapping
   specified in this document between a label which represents a
   Facility or a Severity, and the value which represents the
   corresponding code, is normative.  So the mapping from a label
   configured by operators in syslog.conf or equivalent will
   consistently map to the same Facility code regardless of
   implementation, but the label itself is often semantically
   meaningless, because it is impractical to attempt to enumerate all

   possible facilities, and the mapping (label and corresponding value)
   that is used for an actual Facility is, and has historically been,
   implementation-dependent.

   For example, the foobar application might log messages as having come
   from local7, even though there is no "local" process on the device,
   and the operator can configure syslog.conf to have local7.critical
   messages be relayed, even though there might be multiple facilities
   using Facility local7. This is typical current practice, and
   originators, relays and collectors know how to handle this situation.
   For improved accuracy, the foobar application can also include an
   APPNAME Structured Data Element [RFCPROT].

4. Security Considerations


   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other MIB
   modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  This document has therefore
   no impact on the security of the Internet.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB modules in this document use the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

   Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
   ----------        -----------------------

   syslogTCMIB       { mib-2 YYYY }

   IANA Reg.: Please assign a value under the 'mib-2' subtree
              for the 'syslogTCMIB' MODULE-IDENTITY  and record
              the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.

   RFC Ed.: When the above assignments have been made, please
              - remove the above note
              - replace "YYYY" here with the assigned values and
              - remove this note.

This section documents the development of the draft. It will be
deleted when the draft becomes an RFC.

Revision History:
Changes from draft-ietf-syslog-tc-mib-01.txt
          to draft-ietf-syslog-tc-mib-02.txt
1. WG stance: The Facility codes are normative.
   - added explanation in the Background part.
   - removed comment in the MIB which said that the
     Facility code is not normative.
2. Added reference RFCPROT.

Changes from draft-ietf-syslog-tc-mib-00.txt
          to draft-ietf-syslog-tc-mib-01.txt

1. Revised the Background section. Added
   The Facility and the Severity codes are commonly used to
   categorize and select received syslog messages for processing and
   display.

2. Revised the comments in the MIB. Added
 -- Facility and Severity values are not normative but often used.
 -- Some of the operating system daemons and processes are
 -- traditionally designated by the Facility values given below.

3. Revised the DESCRIPTION and SYNTAX of SyslogFacility
   Removed the "NoMap    99" enumeration.

4. Removed the reference to Syslog Protocol [RFCPROT].
