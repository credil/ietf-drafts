        OPEN ISSUES: 
         
        1. The terminology must be consistent for all EMAN drafts, and 
          this one included. 
           
        2. Apparently, a Child can have different parents in the 
          monitoring, control, and power distribution. And a Child can 
          have multiple parents in each of the topologies. In other 
          words, the different relationships as defined in the EMAN 
          framework must be inserted in this draft, and the 
          pmParentProxyAbilities re-worked.  
         
        3. Length and format of pmUUID. The pmUUID should be a unique id 
          that identifies the device in the universe. A UUID using RFC 
          4122 seems to suffice. However an x.509 certificate 
          conforming to RFC 5280 could also be appropriate. We have 
          specified the field as variable 16 bytes but would like 
          feedback and consensus on the format that is appropriate.  
           
        4. Some editor's notes.                                         
         
         
     1. Introduction 

        The EMAN standards provides network administrators with energy 
        management. This document defines a subset of the Management 
        Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols 
        for power and energy monitoring of network devices and devices 
        attached to the network, as specified in the Power Management 
        Architecture [EMAN-FMWK], which in turn, is based on the Power 
        Monitoring Requirements [EMAN-REQ]. 
         
        This focus of this MIB module is on monitoring energy-aware 
        networks and devices.  The module addresses device

        identification, context information, and relationships between 
        reporting devices, remote devices, and monitoring probes. 
      
        Devices and their sub-components may be characterized by the 
        power-related attributes of a physical entity present in the 
        ENTITY MIB [RFC4133], even though ENTITY MIB compliance is not a 
        requirement due to the variety and broad base of devices 
        concerned with energy management. 
         
     1.1. Energy Management Document Overview 

        This document, which specifies the Energy-Aware Networks and 
        Devices MIB is based on the Energy Management Framework [EMAN-
        FMWK], and meets the requirements specified in the Energy 
        Management requirements [EMAN-REQ], which allows networks and 
        devices to become energy aware. 
                           
        The Power and Energy Monitoring MIB [EMAN-MON-MIB] contains the  
        managed objects for monitoring of power states, along with the 
        power and energy consumption of network devices.  Monitoring of 
        power states includes: retrieving power states, properties of 
        power states, current power state, power state transitions, and 
        power state statistics. This MIB provides the detailed 
        properties of the actual energy rate (power) and of accumulated 
        energy, along with the power quality. 
         
        The applicability statement document [EMAN-AS] provides the list 
        of use cases, cross-reference between existing standards and the 
        EMAN standard, and shows how the EMAN framework relates to other 
        frameworks. 
           
        EDITOR'S NOTE: [EMAN-MON-MIB] and [EMAN-AS] are not EMAN working 
        group documents.  Hence, these references will be changed in the 
        future. 
         
         
     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
        current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
        section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant with

        SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, 
        RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
         
     3. Requirements and Use Cases 

        Requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking 
        devices are specified in [EMAN-REQ].  The requirements in [EMAN-
        REQ] include communications network devices, such as switches, 
        routers, and various connected endpoints.  Beyond the networking 
        devices, for a power monitoring framework to be useful, it 
        should also apply to facility meters, power distribution units, 
        gateway proxies for commercial building control, home automation 
        devices, and devices that interface with the utility and/or 
        smart grid.   
         
        The use cases are specified in the EMAN applicability statement 
        document [EMAN-AS].  
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: say a few words about the use cases when we will 
        have a stable version of the EMAN applicability statement 
        document. 
         
        Accordingly, the scope of the MIB module in this document is in 
        accordance to the requirements specified in [EMAN-REQ] and the 
        use cases in [EMAN-AS]. 
         
         
     4. Terminology 

       The definitions of basic terms like Energy Management, Energy 
       Monitoring, "Power, Energy, and Energy Consumption", Power 
       Monitor, Power Monitor Parent, Power Monitor Child, Power 
       Monitor Meter Domain, Power Level, and Manufacturer Power Level, 
       Nameplate Power, Power Proxy, Power Aggregator, Power 
       Distributor can be found in the Power Management Architecture 
       [EMAN-FMWK]. 
        
       EDITOR'S NOTE: all terms will be copied over in the final 
       version of the draft. The reason is that [EMAN-FMWK] is an 
       informational document, while this document is standard track.

     5.1 Power Monitor Information    

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Information" section in [EMAN-FMWK] 
        for background information.  An energy aware device is 
        considered an instance of a Power Monitor as defined in the 
        [EMAN-FMWK]. 
      

     5.1.1. Power Monitor Identifier 

        Every Power Monitor MUST HAVE a unique Power Monitor index 
        pmIndex, which identifies the primary Power Monitor information 
        in the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module pmTable table.  The pmIndex is a 
        unique index greater than zero for each Power Monitor.  It is 
        recommended that values be assigned sequentially starting from 
        1. 
         
        The pmIndex is complemented by the Power Monitor Universally 
        Unique Identifier [RFC4122] in the pmUUID MIB object. 
         

     5.1.2. Links to other Identifiers 

        While the pmIndex is the primary index for all MIB objects in 
        the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module, the Energy Management Systems (EMS) 
        and Network Management Systems (NMS) must be able to make the 
        link with the identifier(s) in other supported MIB modules. 
         
        The Power Monitor pmPhysicalEntity MUST contain the 
        entPhysicalIndex from the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133], if the ENTITY-
        MIB is supported by the Power Monitor SNMP agent.   
         
        The Power Monitor pmethPortIndex and pmethPortGrpIndex MUST 
        contain the values of pethPsePortIndex and pethPsePortGroupIndex 
        from the Power over Ethernet MIB [RFC3621], if the Power over 
        Ethernet MIB is supported by the Power Monitor SNMP agent. 
      

      
      
     <Parello, Claise>      Expires January 8, 2012           [Page 8] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Energy-aware Networks and Devices MIB> July 2011 
      
        The Power Monitor pmLldpPortNumber MUST contain the 
        lldpLocPortNum from the LLDP MIB [LLDP-MIB], if the LLDP-MED MIB 
        is supported on the Power Monitor SNMP agent. 
         
        The intent behind the links to the other MIB module 
        identifier(s) is certainly not to limit the scope of the ENERGY-
        AWARE-MIB to cases where the ENTITY-MIB, the Power over 
        Ethernet, and the LLDP MIB modules are supported by the SNMP 
        agent.  Indeed, some use cases would not implement any of these 
        three MIB modules on the Power Monitor.  However, in situation 
        where any of these three MIB modules is implemented, the EMS/NMS 
        must be able to correlate the instances in the different MIB 
        modules. 
         
        The pmAlternateKey alternate key object specifies a manufacturer 
        defined string that can be used to identify the Power Monitor.  
        Since EMS/NMS may need to correlate objects across management 
        systems, this alternate key is provided to facilitate such a 
        link.  This optional value is intended as a foreign key or 
        alternate identifier for a manufacturer or EMS/NMS to use to 
        correlate the unique Power Monitor Id in other systems or 
        namespaces. If an alternate key is not available or is not 
        applicable then NULL should be returned. 
                        
         
     5.1.3. Power Monitor Name 

        Every Power Monitor SHOULD have a printable name pmName.  If the 
        entPhysicalName is present for the respective pmPhysicalEntity, 
        i.e. if the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133] is supported, then the pmName 
        SHOULD be identical to the entPhysicalName value specified in 
        the ENTITY-MIB.  If the entPhysicalName is not present, the 
        process to assign the pmName can be implementation specific. 
        Example: DNS Name, MAC address in canonical form, ifName, etc. 
        Possible conventions for pmName are: a text string uniquely 
        identifying the Power Monitor, textual DNS name, MAC-address of 
        the device, interface ifName, etc...   
         
        As an example, in the case of IP phones that don't support the 
        ENTITY-MIB, the pmName can be the device DNS name, while in the 
        case of router/switch line cards (which support the ENTITY-MIB), 
        the pmName should contain the entPhysicalName.   
         
         
     5.1.4. Power Monitor Meter Domain 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Meter Domain" section in [EMAN-FMWK] 
        for background information. 
      
      
     <Parello, Claise>      Expires January 8, 2012           [Page 9] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Energy-aware Networks and Devices MIB> July 2011 
      
      
        When a Power Monitor Parent acts as a Power Aggregator or a 
        Power Proxy, the Power Monitor Parent and its Power Monitor 
        Child/Children MUST be members of the same Power Monitor Meter 
        Domain, specified by the pmDomainName MIB Object.  The 
        pmDomainName, which is an element of the pmTable, is a read-
        write MIB object.  Note that the Power Monitor MUST belong to a 
        single Power Monitor Meter Domain or in other words, a Power 
        Monitor can not belong to more than one Meter Domain. 
         
        The Power Monitor Meter Domain should map 1-1 with a metered or 
        sub-metered portion of the site.  The Power Monitor Meter Domain 
        MUST be configured on the Power Monitor Parent.  The Power 
        Monitor Children MAY inherit their domain parameters from the 
        Power Monitor Parent or the Power Monitor Meter Domain MAY be 
        configured directly in a Power Monitor Child.  
      

     5.1.5. Power Monitor Identity Persistence 

         
        In some situations, the Power Monitor identity information 
        should be persistent even after a device reload.  For example, 
        in a static setup where a switch monitors a series of connected 
        PoE phones, there is a clear benefit for the NMS if the pmIndex 
        and all associated information persist, as it saves a network 
        discovery.  However, in other situations, such as a wireless 
        access point monitoring the mobile user PCs, there is not much 
        advantage to persist the Power Monitor Information.  Therefore, 
        a specific MIB object, the pmTablePersistence, enables and 
        disables the persistence globally for all Power Monitors 
        information in the ENERGY-AWARE-MIB module. 

         
     5.2 Power Monitor Parent and Child 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Parent and Child" section in [EMAN-
        FMWK] for background information.  In order to link the Power 
        Monitor Child and the Power Monitor Parent, the pmParentId is 
        introduced.  
      
        The Power Monitor Child MUST set the pmParentId content to its 
        Power Monitor Parent pmUUID.  In the case of Power Monitor 
        Parent, the pmParentId MUST be set to the null string. 
         
        The Power Monitor Child can indicate that it wants its Power 
        Monitor Parent to proxy capabilities such as, energy reporting, 
        power state configurations, non physical wake capabilities (such 
      
      
     <Parello, Claise>      Expires January 8, 2012          [Page 10] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Energy-aware Networks and Devices MIB> July 2011 
      
        as Wake-on-LAN)), or any combination of capabilities.  These 
        capabilities are indicated in the pmParentProxyAbilities object. 
        In the case of Power Monitor Parent, the pmParentProxyAbilities 
        MUST be set to "none" (0). 
         
        Since the communication between the Power Monitor Parent and 
        Power Monitor Child may not be via SNMP (as defined in EMAN-
        FMWK), a Power Monitor Child can have additional MIB objects 
        that can be used for easier identification by the NMS. The 
        optional objects pmMgmtMacAddress, omMgmtAddressType 
        pmMgmtDNSName can be used to help identify the relationship 
        between the child and other NMS objects.  These objects can be 
        used as an alternate key to help link the Power Monitor with 
        other keyed information that may be stored within the NMS(s) or 
        EMS(s).   
         
        The pmParentId, pmParentProxyAbilities, pmMgmtMacAddress, 
        pmMgmtAddress, pmMgmtAddressType, and pmMgmtDNSName MIB objects 
        SHOULD be implemented for Power Monitor Children, and MAY be 
        implemented for Power Monitor Parents. 
         
        The pmParentId, and pmParentProxyAbilities MUST be implemented 
        by Power Monitor Children. The pmMgmtMacAddress, pmMgmtAddress, 
        pmMgmtAddressType, and pmMgmtDNSName MIB objects SHOULD be 
        implemented for Power Monitor Children, and MAY be implemented 
        for Power Monitor Parents. 
         
         
      
       5.3 Power Monitor Context 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Context" section in [EMAN-FMWK] for 
        background information. 
         
        A Power Monitor can provide a pmImportance value in the range of 
        1..100 to help differentiate the use or relative value of the 
        device.  The importance range is from 1 (least important) to 100 
        (most important).  The default importance value is 1.   
      
        A Power Monitor can provide a set of pmKeywords.  These keywords 
        are a list of tags that can be used for grouping and summary 
        reporting within or between Power Monitor Meter Domains. 
         
        Additionally, a Power Monitor can provide a pmRoleDescription 
        string that indicates the purpose the Power Monitor serves in 
        the network or for the site/business.

     6. Structure of the MIB 

        The primary MIB object in this MIB module is the energyAwareMIB 
        Object.  The pmTable table of energyAwareMIB Object describes an

     8. Security Considerations  

        Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
        thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these 
        objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects 
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.   
      
      
     <Parello, Claise>      Expires January 8, 2012          [Page 25] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Energy-aware Networks and Devices MIB> July 2011 
      
         
        There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB 
        modules with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
        create.  Such objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable 
        in some network environments.  The support for SET operations in 
        a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
        negative effect on network operations.  The following are the 
        tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         
          . Unauthorized changes to the pmDomainName, pmName, 
             pmRoleDescription, pmKeywords, and/or pmImportance MAY 
             disrupt power and energy collection, and therefore any 
             predefined policies defined in the network. 
         
      
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using 
        IPsec), there is still no secure control over who on the secure 
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB modules. 
         
         
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to GET or SET (change/create/delete) them. 
         
         
     9. IANA Considerations 

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
         
          Descriptor                         OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
          ----------                         ----------------------- 
          energyAwareMIB                     { mib-2 xxx } 
                     
        Additions to this MIB module are subject to Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
      
      
     <Parello, Claise>      Expires January 8, 2012          [Page 26] 
         
     Internet-Draft <Energy-aware Networks and Devices MIB> July 2011 
      
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested MIB objects for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description.  Requests for MIB objects that duplicate the 
        functionality of existing objects SHOULD be declined.  The 
        smallest available OID SHOULD be assigned to a new MIB objects.  
        The specification of new MIB objects SHOULD follow the structure 
        specified in Section 6 and MUST be published using a well-
        established and persistent publication medium.
