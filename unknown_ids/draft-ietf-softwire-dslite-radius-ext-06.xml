    <abstract>
      <t>Dual-Stack Lite is a solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6
      connectivity to customers which are addressed only with an IPv6 prefix.
      Dual-Stack Lite requires to pre-configure the Dual-Stack Lite Address
      Family Transition Router (AFTR) tunnel information on the Basic Bridging
      BroadBand (B4) element. In many networks, the customer profile
      information may be stored in Authentication Authorization and Accounting
      (AAA) servers while client configurations are mainly provided through
      Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). This document specifies a
      new Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attribute to
      carry Dual-Stack Lite Address Family Transition Router Tunnel name; the
      RADIUS attribute is defined based on the equivalent DHCPv6
      OPTION_AFTR_NAME option. This RADIUS attribute is meant to be used
      between the RADIUS Server and the Network Access Server (NAS), it is not
      intended to be used directly between the Basic Bridging BroadBand
      element and the RADIUS Server.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Dual-Stack Lite <xref target="RFC6333"></xref> is a solution to offer
      both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity to customers which are addressed only
      with an IPv6 prefix (no IPv4 address is assigned to the attachment
      device). One of its key components is an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel, but a
      Dual-Stack-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) will not know if the
      network it is attached to offers Dual-Stack Lite support, and if it did,
      would not know the remote end of the tunnel to establish a
      connection.</t>

      <t>To inform the Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) of the Address Family
      Transition Router's (AFTR) location, a Fully Qualified Domain Name
      (FQDN) may be used. Once this information is conveyed, the presence of
      the configuration indicating the AFTR's location also informs a host to
      initiate Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) service and become a Softwire
      Initiator.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC6334"></xref> specifies a DHCPv6 option which is
      meant to be used by a Dual-Stack Lite client (Basic Bridging BroadBand
      element, B4) to discover its Address Family Transition Router (AFTR)
      name. In order to be able to populate such option the DHCPv6 Server must
      be pre-provisioned with the Address Family Transition Router (AFTR)
      name.</t>

      <t>In Broadband environments, customer profile may be managed by AAA
      servers, together with user Authentication, Authorization, and
      Accounting (AAA). Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)
      protocol <xref target="RFC2865"></xref> is usually used by AAA Servers
      to communicate with network elements. <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access"></xref> describes a typical
      broadband network scenario in which the Network Access Server (NAS) acts
      as the access gateway for the users (hosts or CPEs) and the NAS embeds a
      DHCPv6 Server function that allows it to locally handle any DHCPv6
      requests issued by the clients.</t>

      <t>Since the DS-Lite AFTR information can be stored in AAA servers and
      the client configuration is mainly provided through Dynamic Host
      Configuration Protocol (DHCP) running between the NAS and the requesting
      clients, a new RADIUS attribute is needed to send AFTR information from
      AAA server to the NAS.</t>

      <t>This document aims at defining a new RADIUS attribute to be used for
      carrying the DS-Lite Tunnel Name, based on the equivalent DHCPv6 option
      already specified in <xref target="RFC6334"></xref></t>

      <t>The terms DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand element (B4) and the

      <t>The <xref target="fig1"></xref> illustrates how the RADIUS protocol
      and DHCPv6 work together to accomplish DS-Lite configuration on the B4
      element when a PPP Session is used to provide connectivity to the
      user.</t>

      <t>The Network Access Server (NAS) operates as a client of RADIUS and as
      DHCP Server for DHC protocol. The NAS initially sends a RADIUS Access
      Request message to the RADIUS server, requesting authentication. Once
      the RADIUS server receives the request, it validates the sending client
      and if the request is approved, the AAA server replies with an Access
      Accept message including a list of attribute-value pairs that describe
      the parameters to be used for this session. This list MAY also contain
      the AFTR Tunnel Name. When the NAS receives a DHCPv6 client request
      containing the DS-Lite tunnel Option, the NAS SHALL use the name
      returned in the RADIUS DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name attribute to populate the
      DHCPv6 OPTION_AFTR_NAME option in the DHCPv6 reply message.</t>

      <t>In the scenario depicted in <xref target="fig2"></xref> the
      Access-Request packet contains a Service-Type attribute with the value
      Authorize Only (17), thus according to <xref target="RFC5080"></xref>
      the Access-Request packet MUST contain a State attribute.</t>

      <t>After receiving the DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name in the initial Access-Accept
      the NAS MUST store the received AFTR Tunnel Name locally. When the B4
      sends a DHCPv6 Renew message to request an extension of the lifetimes
      for the assigned address or prefix, the NAS does not have to initiate a
      new Access-Request towards the AAA server to request the AFTR tunnel
      name. The NAS retrieves the previously stored AFTR tunnel name and uses
      it in its reply.</t>

      <t>According to <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> if the DHCPv6 server to
      which the DHCPv6 Renew message was sent at time T1 has not responded,
      the DHCPv6 client initiates a Rebind/Reply message exchange with any
      available server. In this scenario the NAS receiving the DHCPv6 rebind
      message MUST initiate a new Access-Request towards the AAA server. The
      NAS MAY include the DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name attribute in its
      Access-Request.</t>

      <t>If the NAS does not receive the DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name attribute in the
      Access-Accept it MAY fallback to a pre-configured default tunnel name,
      if any. If the NAS does not have any pre-configured default tunnel name
      or if the NAS receives an Access-Reject, the IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel
      cannot be established, thus the B4 element has only IPv6 connectivity.

      <t>This section specifies the format of the new RADIUS attribute.</t>

      <section anchor="DSLITE-Name" title=" DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name ">
        <t>Description</t>

        <t>The DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name RADIUS attribute contains a Fully Qualified
        Domain Name that refers to the AFTR the client is requested to
        establish a connection with. The NAS SHALL use the name returned in
        the RADIUS DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name attribute to populate the DHCPv6
        OPTION_AFTR_NAME option <xref target="RFC6334"></xref></t>

        <t>This attribute MAY be used in Access-Request packets as a hint to
        the RADIUS server; for example if the NAS is pre-configured with a
        default tunnel name, this name MAY be inserted in the attribute. The
        RADIUS server MAY ignore the hint sent by the NAS and it MAY assign a
        different AFTR tunnel name.</t>

        <t>If the NAS includes the DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name attribute, but the AAA
        server does not recognize it, this attribute MUST be ignored by the
        AAA Server.</t>

        <t>If the NAS does not receive DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name attribute in the
        Access-Accept it MAY fallback to a pre-configured default tunnel name,
        if any. If the NAS does not have any pre-configured default tunnel
        name, the tunnel can not be established.</t>

        <t>If the NAS is pre-provisioned with a default AFTR tunnel name and
        the AFTR tunnel name received in Access-Accept is different from the
        configured default, then the AFTR tunnel name received in the
        Access-Accept message MUST be used for the session.</t>

        <t>If the NAS cannot support the received AFTR tunnel name for any
        reason, the tunnel SHOULD NOT be established.</t>

        <t>When the Access-Request is triggered by a DHCPv6 Rebind message if
        the AFTR tunnel name received in the Access-Accept is different from
        the currently used one for that session, the NAS MUST force the B4 to
        re-establish the tunnel using the new AFTR name received in the
        Access-Accept message.</t>

        <t>If an implementation includes the Change-of-Authorization (CoA)
        messages <xref target="RFC5176"></xref>, they could be used to modify
        the current established DS-Lite tunnel. When the NAS receives a CoA
        Request message containing the DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name attribute, the NAS
        MUST send a Reconfigure message to a B4 to inform the B4 that the NAS
        has new or updated configuration parameters and that the B4 is to
        initiate a Renew/Reply or Information-request/Reply transaction with
        the NAS in order to receive the updated information.</t>

        <t>Upon receiving an AFTR tunnel name different from the currently
        used one, the B4 MUST terminate the current DS-Lite tunnel and the B4
        MUST establish a new DS-LITE tunnel with the specified AFTR.</t>

        <t>The DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name RADIUS attribute MAY be present in
        Accounting-Request records where the Acct-Status-Type is set to Start,
        Stop or Interim-Update. The DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name RADIUS attribute MUST
        NOT appear more than once in a message.</t>

        <t>A summary of the DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name RADIUS attribute format is
        shown below. The fields are transmitted from left to right.</t>
