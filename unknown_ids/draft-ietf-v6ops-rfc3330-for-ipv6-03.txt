Abstract

   This document describes the global and other specialized IPv6 address
   blocks.It does not address IPv6 address space assigned to operators
   and users through the Regional Internet Registries.  These
   descriptions are useful for route and IP filtering, for documentation
   and other purposes.

Internet-Draft         Special-Use IPv6 Addresses           October 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the global and other specialized IPv6 address
   blocks.It does not address IPv6 address space assigned to operators
   and users through the Regional Internet Registries.  These
   descriptions are useful for route and IP filtering, for documentation
   and other purposes.

   The document is structured by address types.  The document format is
   similar to [RFC3330].

   Some tips about filtering are given, but are not mandatory to
   implement.


2.  Address Blocks

2.1.  Node-scoped Unicast

   ::1/128 is the loopback address [RFC4291].

   ::/128 is the unspecified address [RFC4291].

   Addresses within this block should not appear on the public Internet.

2.2.  IPv4-Mapped Addresses

   ::FFFF:0:0/96 is the IPv4-mapped addresses [RFC4291].  Addresses
   within this block should not appear on the public Internet.

2.3.  IPv4-compatible Addresses

   ::ipv4-address/96 is the IPv4-compatible addresses [RFC4291].  These
   addresses are deprecated and should not appear on the public
   Internet.

2.4.  Link-scoped Unicast

   fe80::/10 are the link-local unicast[RFC4291] addresses.Addresses
   within this block should not appear on the public Internet.

2.5.  Unique-Local

   fc00::/7 are the unique-local addresses [RFC4193].  Addresses within
   this block should not appear by default on the public Internet.
   Procedure of advertising these addresses are further described in
   [RFC4193].

2.6.  Documentation Prefix

   The 2001:db8::/32 are the documentation addresses [RFC3849].  They
   are used for documentation purposes such as user manuals, RFCs, etc.
   Addresses within this block should not appear on the public Internet.

2.7.  6to4

   2002::/16 are the 6to4 addresses [RFC4291][RFC3056].  The 6to4
   addresses may be advertised when the site is running a 6to4 relay or
   offering a 6to4 transit service.  However, the provider of this
   service should be aware of the implications of running such
   service[RFC3964], which includes some specific filtering rules for
   6to4.  IPv4 addresses disallowed in 6to4 prefixes are listed in
   section 5.3.1 of [RFC3964].

2.8.  Teredo

   2001::/32 are the Teredo addresses [RFC4380].  The Teredo addresses
   may be advertised when the site is running a Teredo relay or offering
   a Teredo transit service.

2.9.  6bone

   5f00::/8 were the addresses of the first instance of the 6bone
   experimental network [RFC1897].

   3ffe::/16 were the addresses of the second instance of the 6bone
   experimental network [RFC2471].

   Both 5f00::/8 and 3ffe::/16 were returned to IANA [RFC3701].  These
   addresses are subject to future allocation, similar to current
   unallocated address space.  Addresses within this block should not
   appear on the public Internet until they are reallocated.

2.10.  Default Route

   ::/0 is the default unicast route address.

2.11.  IANA Special Purpose IPv6 Address Block

   An IANA registry (iana-ipv6-special-registry) is set[RFC4773] for
   Special Purpose IPv6 address blocks assignments used for experiments
   and other purposes.  Addresses within this registry should be
   reviewed for Internet routing considerations.

2.12.  Multicast

   ff00::/8 are multicast addresses [RFC4291].  They have a 4 bits scope
   in the address field where only some value are of global scope
   [RFC4291].  Only addresses with global scope in this block may appear
   on the public Internet.

   Multicast routes must not appear in unicast routing tables.


3.  Security Considerations

   This document list addresses and guidelines associated with them.
   The guidelines should improve the security of networks by the
   filtering of invalid routing prefixes.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
