Abstract

   For the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 address pool against the slow
   development of IPv6, IPv4/6 coexistence/transition proved to be a
   long period.  In the IPv4/6 transition process, there are many NAT-
   like technologies existing in the internet.  However the NAT boxes
   such as IPv4 NAT, IPv4/6 NAT is insufficient in their reliability and
   scalability, which might cause a single point of failure in IPv4/6
   transition architecture.  This document defines a reliable and
   scalable NAT(RS-NAT) mechanism to solve the problem.

1.  Introduction

   For the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 address pool against the slow
   development of IPv6, IPv4/6 coexistence/transition proved to be a
   long period.  In order to facilitate the connectivity between IPv4
   and IPv6 network, a NAT functionality should be deployed on the edge
   of different IP family network.

   However most of the NAT-like functions are stateful, which maintain
   the state of address mapping for network translation or ALG function.
   The stateful boxes in the network will bring high risks on
   reliability and scalability when the network becomes huge.  For
   example the box will be a single point of failure in a large-scale
   network.  Although some advices are proposed such as NAT64 using
   multi-box, the static configuration and localized mapping information
   in each box are not able to accommodate the dynamic internet
   environment.

   In this document, we proposed a Reliable and Scalable NAT (RS-NAT)
   mechanism to overcome the stateful NAT problem mentioned above, which
   include IPv4 NAT and IPv4/6 NAT.

2.  RS-NAT Overview

   In the topology shown in figure 1, the network can be divided into
   two parts: the User Network and Service Network.  User Network is the
   realm where the users initiate a communication with servers.  The
   Service Network is the realm where the public service server located.
   In addition there are some RS-NAT boxes which act as bridges between
   the networks.

   Figure 1: General Topology of RS-NAT framework

   The User Network and Service Network could be IPv4,IPv6 or Dual-
   stacks.  As a result there are several communication scenarios could
   be deduced from the general topology using the form of IPvx-IPvy,
   which means users with IPvx protocol initiate connections to servers
   with IPvy protocol.  These communication scenarios are (private)IPv4-
   IPv4, IPv4-IPv6, IPv6-IPv4, and IPv6-IPv6.  VRRP[RFC3768] is suitable
   for IPv4-IPv4 scenarios and there is no need to use NAT for IPv6-
   IPv6.  So in this document we mainly focus on IPv4-IPv6/IPv6-IPv4
   scenarios.

   The User Network and Service Network are logical concepts, which may
   be composed of several ASes.  For example the User Network shown in
   Figure 1 may consist of several IPv4 networks belong to diffrent
   network providers.  The User Network may connect to Service Network
   separately through RS-NAT boxes on which BGP [RFC4271] is performed .

   Note that the User Network and Service Network are exchangable
   because an end user can be regarded as both initiator and server from
   different views.

3.  RS-NAT Box

   The following sections will discuss the requirement of RS-NAT Box and
   its basic functions.

   In order to achieve the role of bridge between the two networks in
   the scenarios, which are depicted in sections 3, the RS-NAT box is
   capable of dual-stack and forwording traffic based on IPv4/6 address
   translator.

   In the IPv6-IPv4 scenario RS-NAT router advertise the prefix64
   [I-D.miyata-behave-prefix64] routing information to User Network, and
   advertise the prefix info of static IPv4 address pool to Service
   Network.  In this scenario DNS64[I-D.bagnulo-behave-dns64] is
   employed to assign the prefix64 for each DNS request, which will be
   discussed in section 5.  In the IPv4-IPv6 scenario RS-NAT router
   advertises its own IPv6 prefix routing information to Service
   Network, and sends the prefix info of static IPv4 address pool to
   User Network.  In this scenario DNS ALG mentioned in NAT-PT[RFC2766]
   will be modified to support the separation of the data plane and
   control plane, which will be discussed in section 5.

   The address mapping modules in RS-NAT is useful not only for the IP
   head translation, but essential for some application that embed
   network-layer addresses as well, such as FTP, SIP etc.

4.  Load Balancing Mechanisms

   This section will show how the RS-NAT run and balance the traffic
   among these RS-NAT boxes.

4.1.  IPv6-IPv4 scenario

   Figure 2 illustrates the connection setup in IPv6-IPv4 scenario.  The
   connection setup follows two steps:

   1) User sends DNS query to DNS64 and get the DNS reply with a IPv4-
   embeded IPv6 addresses in the form of Prefix64::IPv4 adress;

   2) User sends the packet to the IPv4-embeded IPv6 addresses.  The
   different IPv6 prefix will lead the packet to different RS-NAT
   routers, which is achieved by the RS-NAT routing function.


                    The Control Plane

              \         +------+       /
               ---------|RS-NAT|-------
                        +------+
                   --------------------
                    The Data Plane

   Figure 2: IPv6-IPv4 Connection Setup

   As mentioned previously RS-NAT routers run BGP and keep BGP neighbor
   information with each other.  Each RS-NAT router will maintain the
   IPv6 prefix which is identical with the prefix DNS64 stores.  RS-NAT
   will performe a Prefix-Assignment Algorithm to decide individually
   which part of prefix64 they are in charge of.  The Prefix-Assignment
   Algorism follows the new idea that the IPv6 prefix is equally divided
   into several portions.  And, each of them is assigned to RS-NAT
   routers.

   For example, there is 2^8 2001::/24 in prefix64 pool of 2001::/16 and
   2 RS-NAT routers.  The Assignment plan is that prefixes from 2001:
   0000::/24 to 2001:7f00::/24 will be assigned to the router with
   larger IP address, and the prefixes from 2001:8000::/24 to 2001:
   ff00::/24 is in the charge of the other router.  If there are more

Internet-Draft                   RS-NAT                        July 2009


   RS-NAT routers, these prefixes can also easy assigned to them
   according to the IP address sorting.

   In order to balance the traffic among these RS-NAT routers, each
   router should advertise the route of its aggregated prefix64 to User
   Network.  Note that for the Redundancy consideration each router
   could advertise overlapped prefix64 with low priority in case other
   RS-NAT routers are failed.

   Note that once RS-NAT routers are failed or new RS-NAT routers are
   configured to join in, the routing for load balance can be
   automatically configured by RS-NAT routers by themselves.  Prefix-
   Assignment Algorithm will be triggered in each RS-NAT router to
   recompute the router prefix.  BGP KEEPALVE and OPEN messages are used
   to achieve that trigger.

4.2.  IPv4-IPv6 scenario

   The load balancing mechanism in IPv4-IPv6 is similar to the one in
   IPv6-IPv4 in that the IPv4 address pool should shared by RS-NAT
   routers and each RS-NAT router is responsible to advertise the route
   of their IPv4 address pool, which is similar to the routing procedure
   of RS-NAT routers in IPv6-IPv4.  The IPv4-IPv6 Connection Setup is
   shown in figure 3.

   Figure 3 illustrates the connection setup in IPv4-IPv6 scenario.  The
   connection setup follows three steps:

   1) User sends DNS query to DNS4 and the query will be redirected to
   DNS6 through a DNS-ALG box.  Once the DNS reply reachs the DNS-ALG
   box, the box will pick a IPv4 address from the IPv4 address pool and
   form a mapping with the IPv6 address form the answer of the DNS
   reply.  A new DNS relpy will be generated and sent to DNS4 and User.

   2) Because the packet translation will be done in the RS-NAT router,
   the DNS ALG box should send the mapping info to RS-NAT routers using
   new BGP attribute which will be defined in section 6

   3) User sends the packet to the IPv4 address got from the answer of
   DNS reply.  The different IPv4 addresses will lead the packet to
   different RS-NAT routers, which is achieved by the RS-NAT routing
   function.

   Note that in step 1 the DNS-ALG box acts just as DNS-ALG functions
   module in NAT-PT box.  The difference between the two box is that
   DNS-ALG box in our plan is only responsible for the control plan
   without packet translation.  In addition DNS-ALG box should in charge
   of the mapping distribution among those RS-NAT routers

   The differences between the two scenarios include two parts:

   o  The control plane: In IPv6-IPv4 it is the DNS64 that synchronize
      the IPv6 and IPv4 address for IPv4 hosts, while in IPv4-IPv6 a DNS
      ALG server monitors the DNS request and reply forming the mapping
      of IPv4/6 address.

   o  Address mapping advertisement: For the load balancing reason,DNS
      ALG server is not designed for traffic translation and forwarding,
      which are in the charge of RS-NAT routers.  As a result the DNS
      ALG server should send the mapping info to RS-NAT routers using
      new BGP attribute which will be defined in section 6.

5.  Redundancy Mechanisms

   If there exits multi-boxes between the two edge of network, problems
   will arise when some boxes are not stable or failed.  The problems
   are mainly in two aspects.  The first problem is in routing aspect:
   when one box fails, there is no other valid routes to the
   destination.  The second is in address mapping aspect: when one box
   is failed, the address mapping information in the box is lost.
   Furthermore, it will cause the flows broke up and reconnection.

   The first problem is solved in section 4 in which the routing
   mechanism makes sure that the taffic will find a way out through
   another RS-NAT router by setting the different route cost or
   preference.  In this section we will define a BGP attribute that one
   RS-NAT can advertise the local address mapping to other neighbors
   which guarantees the redundancy of mapping info.  With that
   redundancy address mapping information RS-NAT routers are able to
   translate the new traffic

5.1.  Address mapping Attribute

   Address mapping attribute is an optional transitive attribute that is
   composed of a set of TLVs.  The type code of the attribute is to be
   assigned by IANA.  Each TLV contains information corresponding to a
   particular tunnel technology.  The TLV is structured as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |    mapping Type (2 Octets)    |        Length (2 Octets)      |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      |                             Value                             |
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   apping Type (2 octets): It identifies the type of the mapping
   information being transmitted.  This document defines the following
   types:

   - IPv4-IPv4: mapping Type = 1

   - IPv4-IPv6/IPv6-IPv4: mapping Type = 2

   - IPv6-IPv6: mapping Type=3

   Unknown types are to be ignored and skipped upon receipt.

   Length (2 octets): the total number of octets of the Value field.

   Value (variable): The value is composed of the address mapping
   information.  If mapping type is 2, the value contains an IPv4/6
   address mapping just simply structured as follows:

           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
           |    IPv4 address (4 Octets)    |
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
           |                               |
           |    IPv6 address (16 Octets)   |
           |                               |
           |                               |
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

5.2.  Performance consideration

   As the mapping information is tremendous and dynamic.  The
   performance of RS-NAT is an important issue.  BGP reflector can be
   utilized to reduce the BGP update massage.  If reflector is deployed,
   new mechanism should guarantee each RS-NAT routers knowing the number
   of routers.In addition some optimization of RS-NAT and possible
   modifications of BGP will be explored in the next version of this
   document.

   Note that RS-NAT routers are located on the edge of network and they
   may not connect directly.  BGP has its nature advantage to do
   signaling among edge routers over some intra-domain protocol.
