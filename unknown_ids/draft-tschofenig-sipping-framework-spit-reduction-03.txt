Abstract

   Spam, defined as sending unsolicited messages to someone in bulk, is
   likely to become a problem on SIP open-wide deployed networks.  A
   number of solutions have been proposed for dealing with Spam for
   Internet Telephony (SPIT) and unwanted communication, for example,
   content filtering, black lists, white lists, consent-based
   communication, reputation systems, address obfuscation, limited use
   addresses, turing tests, computational puzzles, payments at risk,
   circles of trust, and many others.

   This document describes the big picture that illustrates how the
   different building blocks fit together and can be deployed
   incrementally.

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam         February 2008


1.  Introduction

   The problem of Spam for Internet Telephony (SPIT) is an imminent
   challenge and only the combination of several techniques can provide
   a framework for dealing with unwanted communication attempts.

   [I-D.ietf-sipping-spam] provides four core recommendations that need
   to be considered for a SPIT solution, namely

   o  Strong Identity
   o  White Lists
   o  Solve the Introduction Problem
   o  Don't Wait Until its Too Late

   This document illustrates how existing building blocks can be put
   together to form a solution to deal with SPIT.  New building blocks
   can be added to provide more efficient SPIT handling, since there is
   no single solution that provides 100 % protection.

   The purpose of this document defines a model of internal device
   processing, protocol interfaces, and terminology to illustrate a way
   in which SPIT prevention techniques can be added in a seamless
   fashion.  We focus only on the most important solution components and
   consider many other aspects either outside the scope of this work
   (see Appendix A) and postpone them for future work.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Framework

   Figure 1 shows the interaction between the end host and a SIP proxy
   belonging to its VoIP provider.  One important part of the overall
   solution is the ability to make authorization decisions based on
   incoming communication attempts.  The entity that writes these
   authorization rules is referred as Rule Maker.  The Rule Maker might
   be a user via some form of user interface.  Some rules may be
   generated automatically by a piece of software by observing the users
   behavior.  Furthermore, in certain deployment environments an initial
   rule set will be provided by some third party entity, such as the
   enterprise system administrator or the VoIP provider.

   Policies are processed by corresponding module within the SIP proxy,

   called Authorization Engine, that interacts with the message routing
   component.  By following this architectural approach the Policy
   Decision Point (PDP) and the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) are
   closely combined.  As such, authorization policies are stored at at a
   SIP proxy rather than the SIP UA client itself.  The implications of
   relocating these two functions, PDP and PEP, to the SIP UA client are
   described in Appendix B.

   Assume that an arbitrary entity transmits a message to a specific URI
   that finally hits the SIP proxy on the recipients side.  Information
   provided within that message are used as input to the rule
   evaluation.  Any part of the message may serve as input to the
   evaluation process but for practical reasons only a few selected
   fields do most of the work.  The authenticated identity of the sender

   is probably the most valuable information item.  One could, however,
   imagine that other information, such as reputation information
   obtained from social networks, could offer additional input to the
   authorization engine.

   The protocol interaction for authorizing the message sender refers to
   the ability of the recipient or the proxy to interact with the sender
   to request authorization.  The request for authorization might
   require the message sender to be challenged (e.g., via hash cash
   [I-D.jennings-sip-hashcash], via SIP payment
   [I-D.jennings-sipping-pay], or via CAPTCHAs
   [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-captcha]).  Some other mechanisms, such as
   SIP Identity do not require the verifying entity to challenge the
   authentication service since the identity assertion is pushed towards
   the recipient.

   Figure 2 shows this integration step.  The conditions part of the
   rule offer a mechanisms to incrementally extend the overall framework
   with new components.  Depending on the outcome of the rule
   evaluation, the message may be re-routed to another entity, such as
   an answering machine, to the recipient, rejected or other actions are
   triggered.  The latter aspect is particularly interesting since it
   allows further solution components to be executed.

   Note that some traffic analysis and consequently some form of content
   filtering (e.g., of MESSAGEs) message be applied locally within the
   VoIP provider's domain also under the control of the end user.
   However, this is largely an implementation-specific technique without
   protocol impact.  For example, consider a VoIP provider that wants to

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam         February 2008


   utilize a statistical analysis tool for Spam prevention.  It is not
   necessary to standardized the algorithms nor protocols; the impact
   for the authorization policies is mainly the ability to allow the
   Rule Maker to enable or to disable the usage of these statistical
   techniques and potentially to map the output of the analysis process
   to value range from 0 (i.e., the message is not classified as Spam)
   and 100 (i.e., the message was classified as Spam).  A Rule Maker may
   decide to act with an appropriate action on a certain level of Spam
   marking.

   Authenticated Identities:

      Initial VoIP provider are likely to secure their SIP signaling
      using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or IP security (IPsec)
      between neighboring providers and use P-Asserted-ID [RFC3325].

         Note: SIP Identity is comparable to DomainKeys Identified Mail
         (DKIM) [I-D.ietf-dkim-overview] used for associating a
         "responsible" identity with an email message and provides a
         means of verifying that the association is legitimate.

      SIP Identity [RFC4474] is a proposal for stronger security
      mechanisms used to provide the verification service with the
      authenticated identity.  SIP Identity is a reasonably simple
      specification and does not rely on a huge amount of infrastructure
      support.

      This framework does not assume a specific mechanism for asserting
      identities to be used but a strong identity mechanism is a pre-
      requisity for authorization policy handling to be successful.

   Authorization Policies:

      Even if policy decision making and policy enforcement is done
      outside the SIP UA client then still there might not be a need to
      standardize an authorization policy language if the policies can
      be modified via a webpage.  This approach of policy handling is
      done in many cases today already for various applications.

      Unfortunately, this approach tends to become cumbersome for end
      users and therefore it is better to hide a lot of policy details
      from the end user itself and to make use of context information,
      for example, address books and authorization policies available
      already created for presence based systems.

      Additionally, a user may have multiple devices and a consistent
      view of the policies should be provided.

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam         February 2008


      An example solution for authorization policies for dealing with
      reducing unwanted communication is described in
      [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-spit-policy] with the requirements
      detailed in [I-D.froment-sipping-spit-requirements].

   There is still one significant problem unsolved: since white lists
   need to be created somehow and hence there is an introduction
   problem.  Section 4 discusses this aspect in more details.


4.  Communication Patterns and User Groups

   When communication takes place then at least three types of groups
   can be identified.

4.1.  Closed Groups

   People in this group communicate only with the peers in their group.
   They do not appreciate communication attempts from outside.
   Communication is possible only for people within this list.  Here is
   an example of a closed group: Consider parents that do not want their
   children from getting contacted by strangers.  Hence, they may want
   to create a white list containing the identifies of known friends,
   parents and other relatives on behalf of their kids.

   The usage of authorization policies for usage with closed groups is
   straight forward.  The introduction problem is also not considered
   very large given that the identities are typically known.

4.2.  Semi-Open Groups

   In a semi-open environment all members of the same group are allowed
   to get in contact with everyone else (e.g., for example in a company
   environment).  For members outside the company the communication
   patters depend on the role of the person (e.g., standardization
   people, sales people, etc.) and on the work style of the person.

   For this category we distinguish a number of (non-spam) message
   sources based on their characteristics:

   o  "friends" or "acquaintances", i.e., those we have communicated
      with before.
   o  strangers, divided into 'interesting' and 'uninteresting'.  The
      latter are messages from people that someone does not care to have
      a conversation with or respond to, at least at that particular
      moment.

   Strangers can be defined by individual names or whole domains.  A



Tschofenig, et al.       Expires August 28, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam         February 2008


   special class of 'stranger' messages are transaction-related
   communications, such as Instant Messaging or automated calls from an
   airline or shipping company.

   One way to deal with the introduction problem is to make use of
   techniques like hash cash [I-D.jennings-sip-hashcash] or Completely
   Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart
   (CAPTCHA) based robot challenges [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-captcha].
   Alternatively, a communication attempt may also be forwarded to an
   answering maschine or alternative ways of establishing the initial
   interaction may be proposed.

   The usage of authorization policies for usage with Semi-Open Groups
   is challenging but is considered manageable.

4.3.  Open Groups

   People in this type of group are not allowed to limit communication
   attempts.  Help desks, certain people in governmental agencies,
   banks, insurance companies, etc.

   For open groups a solution for providing SPIT prevention is far more
   complicated.  Consider a person working on a customer support
   helpdesk.  Ideally, they would like to receive only calls from
   friendly customers (although the motivation for calling is most
   likely a problem) and the topic of the calls only relates to problems
   they are able to solve.  Without listening to the caller they will
   have a hard time to know whether the call could be classified as
   SPIT.  Another extreme case is a Public Safety Answering Point where
   emergency service personell is not allowed to reject calls either.

   Many SPIT prevention techniques might not be applicable since
   blocking callers is likely not possible and applying other
   techniques, such as turing tests, might not be ideal in an case of
   open groups.

   Statistical analysis may be helpful in some cases to deliver
   additional information about the calling party.  Social networks
   might provide similar techniques based on reputation based systems.

4.4.  Summary

   Based on the discussions regarding communication patters and groups
   the following observations can be made:

   o  A single person very likely has many roles and they may have an
      impact on the communication patterns.




Tschofenig, et al.       Expires August 28, 2008                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         Framework for Reducing Spam         February 2008


         For example, consider a person who is working in a company but
         also want to be available for family members.
   o  The context in which a person is may change at any time.  For
      example, a person might be available for family members while at
      work except during an important meeting where communication
      attempts may be rejected.  Switching a context has an impact for
      reachability and the means for communicating with a specific
      recipient, based on enabled rule sets.

   From an authorization policy point of view it is important to be able
   to express a sphere (i.e., the state a user is in) and to switch
   between different spheres easily by thereby switching to a different
   rule set.

4.5.  Usability

   An important aspect in the usage of authorization policies is to
   assist the user when creating policies.  Ideally, the policies should
   be established automatically.  Below, there are a couple of examples
   to illustrate the idea given that these aspects are largely
   implementation issues:

   o  It must be possible for the proxy to automatically add addresses
      on outbound messages and calls to the rule set.  This approach is
      similar to stateful packet filtering firewalls where outbound
      packets establish state at the firewall to allow inbound packets
      to traverse it again.
   o  Already available information in the address book can be used for
      building the policy rules there is quite likely already a
      relationship available with these persons existent.
   o  A large amount of email is non-personal, automated communication,
      such as newsletters, confirmations and legitimate advertisements.
      These are often tagged as spam by content filters.  This type of
      correspondence is usually initiated by a transaction over the web,
      such as a purchase or signing up for a service.
      [I-D.shacham-http-corr-uris], for example, defines an HTTP header
      for conveying future correspondence addresses that can be
      integrated in the rule set.


5.  Protocol Interactions

   This section describes the necessary building blocks that are
   necessary to tie the framework together.

5.1.  Rule Enforcement via a Trusted Intermediary

   o  Some from of strong identity assurance is required to build the
      basis for identity-based authorization.  SIP Identity [RFC4474] or
      P-Asserted-ID [RFC3325] are examples of available mechanisms.
      These mechanisms allow the authenticated identity of the sending
      party to be determined.
   o  Authorization Policies based on the Common Policy framework
      [RFC4745], as extended in [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-spit-policy] for
      the purpose of SPIT prevention, are mandatory to implement at the
      end host side and at the trusted intermediary.  The implementation
      of the rule evaluation engine might only be necessary on the
      trusted VoIP proxy.  Harmonization with the work done for presence
      authorization [I-D.ietf-simple-presence-rules], which is based on
      Common Policy [RFC4745], can be accomplished and is highly
      desirable.
   o  XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) [RFC4825] is used to
      create, modify and delete authorization policies and is mandatory
      to implement at the end host side and at the trusted intermediary.

5.2.  Incremental Deployment

   An important property is incremental deployment of additional
   solution components that can be added and used when they become
   available.  This section aims to illustrate how the extensibility is
   accomplished, based on an example.

   Consider a VoIP provider that provides authorization policies that
   provide the following functionality equivalent to the Common Policy
   framework, i.e., identity-based, sphere and validity based conditions
   initially.  For actions only 'redirection' and 'blocking' is
   provided.  In our example we give this basic functionality the AUID
   'new-spit-policy-example' with the namespace
   'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:new-spit-policy-example'.

   When a client queries the capabilities of a SIP proxy in the VoIP
   providers network using XCAP the following exchange may take place.


   GET   /xcap-caps/global/index HTTP/1.1
   Host: xcap.example.com

                    Initial XCAP Query for Capabilities

           Initial XCAP Response with the supported Capabilities

   As shown in the example above, Common Policy and the example SPIT
   extension is implemented and the client can upload rules according to
   the definition of the rule set functionality.

   Later, when the VoIP provider updates the functionality of
   authorization policies as more sophisticated mechanisms become
   available and get implemented the functionality of the authorization
   policy engine is enhanced with, for example, hashcash and the ability
   to perform statistical analysis of signaling message.  The latter
   functionality comes with the ability to mark messages are Spam and
   the ability for end users to enable/disable this functionality.  We
   use the namespaces 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:hashcash' and
   'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:statistical-analysis' for those.

   A end user could now make use of these new functions and a capability
   query of the SIP proxy would provide the following response.


   GET   /xcap-caps/global/index HTTP/1.1
   Host: xcap.example.com

5.3.  Botnets

   A botnet is a large number of compromised maschines that are used to
   create and send spam or viruses or flood a network with messages as a
   denial of service attack.

   Such a botnet represents a significant challenge for a VoIP
   infrastructure and also for the mechanisms proposed in this document.
   Recently observed attacks indicated that some botnets tried to steal
   credentials to distribute messages with "real" identities.  To deal
   with the threat it is useful to classify the behavior of these bots
   into three categories, namely

   o  The botnet does not have access to the user's credentials.  In
      this case identity-based white lists provides adequate protection.
   o  The botnets does have access to user's credentials of compromised
      maschines but distributes messages in a random fashion.  In this
      case identity-based white lists provides adequate protection since
      it is unlikely that the recipient will have that person in their
      whitelist.
   o  In this category the botnet has access to the user's credentials
      and utilizes addresses from the user's addressbook.  In this case
      whitelists do not provide a proper protection.  Since the

      recipient knows the sender of the message it would, in many cases,
      be able to get in contact with him or her and report the observed
      problem.  This approach does not work with a pure maschine-to-
      maschine communication environment without user involvement.


6.  Privacy Considerations

   This document does not propose to distribute the user's authorization
   policies to other VoIP providers nor is the configuration of policies
   at SIP proxies other than the trusted user's VoIP provider necessary.
   Furthemore, if blocking or influencing of the message processing is
   executed by the VoIP provider then they have to be explicitly enabled
   by the end user.  Blocking of messages, even if it is based on
   "super-clever" machine learning techniques often introduces
   unpredictability.

   Legal norms from fields of law can take regulative effects in the
   context of SPIT processing, such as constitutional law, data
   protection law, telecommunication law, teleservices law, criminal
   law, and possibly administrative law.  See, for example, [Law1],
   [Law2] and [Law3].  For example, it is mandatory to pass full control
   of SPIT filtering to the end user, as this minimises legal problems.

   An overview about regulatory aspects can be found in [Spit-AL].


7.  Example

   This section shows an example whereby we consider a user
   Bob@company-example.com that writes (most likely via a nice user
   interface) the following policies.  We use a high-level language to
   show the main idea of the policies.

                         Example of Bob's Rule Set

   At some point in time Bob uploads his policies to the SIP proxy at
   his VoIP providers SIP proxy.


         PUT
         /spit-policy/users/sip:bob@company-example.com/index/~~/ruleset

         HTTP/1.1

         Host: proxy.home-example.com

          <<<< Added policies go in here. >>>>
          [Editor's Note: In a future version an XML example
                          policy document will be listed here.]

                       Uploading Policies using XCAP

   When BoB receives a call from his friends, alice@foo.example and
   tony@bar.example.com, then all the rules related to the spit policy
   are checked.  Only the first rule (rule 1) matches and is applied.
   Thus, the call is forwarded without any further checks based on Rule
   1.  The rules assume that the authenticated identity of the caller
   has been verified.

   When Bob receives a call from a co-worker,

   Charlie@company-example.com, Rule 2 is applied since the domain part
   in the rule matches the domain part of Charlie's identity.

   Now, when Bob receives a contact from an unknown user, called Mallice
   in this example.  Rule 3 indicates that an extended return-
   routability test using hashcash [I-D.jennings-sip-hashcash] is used
   with the call being redirected to Bob's voicebox afterwards.  This
   exchange is shown in Figure 9.

   Depending on the outcome of the exchange the call is forwarded to a
   mailbox sip:voicebox@company-example.com (in case Malory returned the
   correct solution, see Rule 4) or blocked in case an incorrect
   response was provided.  It might be quite easy to see how this rule
   set can be extended to support other SPIT handling mechanisms as well
   (e.g., CAPTCHAs, SIP Pay, etc.).

8.  Security Considerations

   This document aims to describe a framework for addressing Spam for
   Internet Telephony (SPIT) in order to make it simple for users to
   influence the behavior of SIP message routing with an emphasis on
   SPIT prevention.

   The framework relies on three building blocks, namely SIP Identity,
   authorization policies based on Common Policy and Presence
   Authorization Policy, and XCAP.

   As a high-level overview, the framework allows the user to control
   end-to-end connectivity at the SIP message routing level whereby the
   glue that lets all parts fit together is based on authorization
   policies.  Several other solution components can be developed
   independently and can be plugged into the framework as soon as
   available.

   It must be avoided to introduce Denial of Service attacks against the
   recipient by misguiding him or her to install authorization policies
   that allow senders to bypass the policies although that was never
   intended by the recipient.  Additionally, it must not be possible by
   extensions to the authorization policy framework to create policies
   to block legitimate senders or to stall the processing of the
   authorization policy engine.

Appendix A.  Outside the Scope

   We consider the following aspects outside the scope of this document:

   o  Mechanisms to publish SPIT causing parties on the Internet, i.e.,
      information about domains that create SPIT.
   o  Determining the source of unwanted traffic in real-time.
   o  Pushing packet filters and authorization policies towards the SPIT
      sending domain.


Appendix B.  Authorization Engine in SIP UA

   When white lists are stored and managed only at the SIP UA client
   then the authorization policies language and the protocol to modify
   the policies do not need to be standardized; they are purely
   implementation specific details.

   While this appears to be an advantage there are various drawbacks

   including the inability to synchronize policies among different
   devices.  Additionally, some information that is typically available
   to the Policy Decision Point may not be available to the end host.
   To avoid standardizing the exchange of such type of information an
   abstract form of Spam marking is proposed in
   [I-D.wing-sipping-spam-score].
