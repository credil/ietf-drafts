Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE router requirements           August 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document defines basic IPv6 features for a residential or small
   office router referred to as an IPv6 CE router.  Typically these
   routers also support IPv4.

   Mixed environments of dual-stack hosts and IPv6-only hosts (behind
   the CE router) can be more complex if the IPv6-only devices are using
   a translator to access IPv4 servers [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework].
   Support for such mixed environments is not in scope of this document.

   This document specifies how an IPv6 CE router automatically
   provisions its WAN interface, acquires address space for provisioning
   of its LAN interfaces and fetches other configuration information
   from the service provider network.  Automatic provisioning of more
   complex topology than a single router with multiple LAN interfaces is
   out of scope for this document.

   See [RFC4779] for a discussion of options available for deploying
   IPv6 in Service Provider access networks.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

                             router that connect IPv6 hosts.

   IPv6 Customer Edge router a node intended for home or small office
                             use which forwards IPv6 packets not
                             explicitly addressed to itself.  The IPv6
                             CE router connects the end-user network to
                             a service provider network.

   IPv6 host                 any device implementing an IPv6 stack
                             receiving IPv6 connectivity through the
                             IPv6 CE router

                             the end-user network.  Examples are
                             Ethernets (simple or bridged), 802.11
                             wireless or other LAN technologies.  An
                             IPv6 CE router may have one or more network

   Service Provider          an entity that provides access to the
                             Internet.  In this document, a Service
                             Provider specifically offers Internet
                             access using IPv6, and may also offer IPv4
                             Internet access.  The Service Provider can
                             provide such access over a variety of
                             different transport methods such as DSL,
                             cable, wireless, and others.

   WAN interface             an IPv6 CE router's attachment to a link
                             used to provide connectivity to the Service
                             Provider network; example link technologies
                             include Ethernets (simple or bridged), PPP
                             links, Frame Relay, or ATM networks as well
                             as Internet-layer (or higher-layer)
                             "tunnels", such as tunnels over IPv4 or
                             IPv6 itself.


3.  Architecture

3.1.  Current IPv4 End-user Network Architecture

   An end-user network will likely support both IPv4 and IPv6.  It is
   not expected that an end-user will change their existing network
   topology with the introduction of IPv6.  There are some differences
   in how IPv6 works and is provisioned which has implications for the
   network architecture.  A typical IPv4 end-user network consist of a
   "plug and play" router with NAT functionality and a single link
   behind it, connected to the Service Provider network.

   A typical IPv4 NAT deployment by default blocks all incoming
   connections.  Opening of ports is typically allowed using UPnP IGD
   [UPnP-IGD] or some other firewall control protocol.

   Another consequence of using private address space in the end-user
   network is that it provides stable addressing, i.e. it never changes
   even when you change Service Providers, and the addresses are always
   there even when the WAN interface is down or the customer edge router
   has not yet been provisioned.

   Rewriting addresses on the edge of the network also allows for some
   rudimentary multi-homing; even though using NATs for multi-homing
   does not preserve connections during a fail-over event [RFC4864].

   Many existing routers support dynamic routing, and advanced end users

   can build arbitrary, complex networks using manual configuration of
   address prefixes combined with a dynamic routing protocol.

3.2.  IPv6 End-user Network Architecture

   The end-user network architecture for IPv6 should provide equivalent
   or better capabilities and functionality than the current IPv4
   architecture.

   The end-user network is a stub network.  Figure 1 illustrates the
   model topology for the end-user network.

                 An example of a typical end-user network.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE router requirements           August 2010


   o  Provisioning of the LAN interfaces

   Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (ULA) [RFC4193] are used by hosts
   communicating within the End-user Network; this is functionally
   similar to RFC1918 addresses used within an IPv4 End-user Network.
   The IPv6 CE router defaults to acting as the demarcation point
   between two networks by providing a ULA boundary, a multicast zone
   boundary and ingress and egress traffic filters.

   For IPv6 multicast traffic the IPv6 CE router may act as an Multicast
   Listener Discovery (MLD) proxy [RFC4605] and may support a dynamic
   multicast routing protocol.

   The IPv6 CE router may be manually configured in an arbitrary
   topology with a dynamic routing protocol.  Automatic provisioning and
   configuration is described for a single IPv6 CE router only.


4.  Requirements

4.1.  General Requirements

   The IPv6 CE router is responsible for implementing IPv6 routing; that
   is, the IPv6 CE router must look up the IPv6 Destination address in
   its routing table to decide to which interface it should send the
   packet.

   In this role, the IPv6 CE router is responsible for ensuring that
   traffic using its ULA addressing does not go out the WAN interface,
   and does not originate from the WAN interface.

   G-1:  An IPv6 CE router is an IPv6 node according to the IPv6 Node
         Requirements [I-D.ietf-6man-node-req-bis] specification.

   G-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST implement ICMP according to [RFC4443].
         In particular point to point links MUST be handled as described
         in section 3.1 of [RFC4443].

   G-3:  The IPv6 CE router MUST NOT forward any IPv6 traffic between
         its LAN Interface(s) and its WAN Interface until the router has
         successfully completed the IPv6 address acquisition process.

4.2.  WAN Side Configuration

   The IPv6 CE router will need to support connectivity to one or more
   access network architectures.  This document describes an IPv6 CE
   router that is not specific to any particular architecture or Service
   Provider, and supports all commonly used architectures.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE router requirements           August 2010


   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and DHCPv6 protocols operate over any type of
   IPv6 supported link-layer and there is no need for a link-layer
   specific configuration protocol for IPv6 network layer configuration
   options as in e.g.  PPP IPCP for IPv4.  This section makes the
   assumption that the same mechanism will work for any link-layer, be
   it Ethernet, DOCSIS, PPP or others.

   WAN side requirements:

   W-1:  When the router is attached to the WAN interface link it MUST
         act as an IPv6 host for the purposes of stateless or stateful
         interface address assignment ([RFC4862] / [RFC3315]).

   W-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST generate a link-local address and
         finish Duplicate Address Detection according to [RFC4862] prior
         to sending any Router Solicitations on the interface.  The
         source address used in the subsequent Router Solicitation MUST
         be the link-local address on the WAN interface.

   W-3:  Absent of other routing information the IPv6 CE router MUST use
         Router Discovery as specified in [RFC4861] to discover a
         default router(s) and install default route(s) in its routing
         table with the discovered router's address as the next-hop.

   W-4:  The router MUST act as a requesting router for the purposes of
         DHCPv6 prefix delegation ([RFC3633]).

   W-5:  DHCPv6 address assignment (IA_NA) and DHCPv6 prefix delegation
         (IA_PD) SHOULD be done as a single DHCPv6 session.

   W-6:  The IPv6 CE router MUST use a persistent DUID for DHCPv6
         messages.  The DUID MUST NOT change between network interface
         resets or IPv6 CE router reboot.

   Link-layer requirements:

   WLL-1:  If the WAN interface supports Ethernet encapsulation, then
           the IPv6 CE router MUST support IPv6 over Ethernet [RFC2464].

   WLL-2:  If the WAN interface supports PPP encapsulation the IPv6 CE
           router MUST support IPv6 over PPP [RFC5072].

   WLL-3:  If the WAN interface supports PPP encapsulation, in a dual-
           stack environment with IPCP and IPV6CP running over one PPP
           logical channel, the NCPs MUST be treated as independent of
           each other and start and terminate independently.

   Address assignment requirements:

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE router requirements           August 2010


   WAA-1:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support SLAAC [RFC4862].

   WAA-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST follow the recommendation in
           [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-subnet-model] and in particular the
           handling of the L-flag in the Router Advertisement Prefix
           Information Option.

   WAA-3:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support DHCPv6 [RFC3315] client
           behavior.

   WAA-4:  The IPv6 CE router MUST be able to support the following
           DHCPv6 options: IA_NA, Reconfigure Accept [RFC3315],
           DNS_SERVERS [RFC3646].

   WAA-5:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD support the DHCPv6 SNTP option
           [RFC4075] and the Information Refresh Time Option [RFC4242].

   WAA-6:  If the IPv6 CE router receives an RA message (described in
           [RFC4861]) with the M-flag set to 1, the IPv6 CE router MUST
           do DHCPv6 address assignment (request an IA_NA option).

   WAA-7:  If the IPv6 CE router is unable to assign address(es) through
           SLAAC it MAY do DHCPv6 address assignment (request an IA_NA)
           even if the M-flag is set to 0.

   WAA-8:  If the IPv6 CE router does not acquire global IPv6
           address(es) from either SLAAC or DHCPv6, then it MUST create
           global IPv6 address(es) from its delegated prefix(es) and
           configure those on one of its internal virtual network
           interfaces.

   WAA-9:  As a router the IPv6 CE router MUST follow the weak host
           model [RFC1122].  When originating packets out an interface
           it will use a source address from another of its interfaces
           if the outgoing interface does not have an address of
           suitable scope.

   Prefix Delegation requirements:

   WPD-1:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support DHCPv6 prefix delegation
           requesting router behavior as specified in [RFC3633] (IA_PD
           option).

   WPD-2:  The IPv6 CE router MAY indicate as a hint to the delegating
           router the size of the prefix it requires.  If so, it MUST
           ask for a prefix large enough to assign one /64 for each of
           its interfaces rounded up to the nearest nibble and MUST be
           configurable to ask for more.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE router requirements           August 2010


   WPD-3:  The IPv6 CE router MUST be prepared to accept a delegated
           prefix size different from what is given in the hint.  If the
           delegated prefix is too small to address all of its
           interfaces, the IPv6 CE router SHOULD log a system management
           error.

   WPD-4:  The IPv6 CE router MUST always initiate DHCPv6 prefix
           delegation, regardless of the M and O-flags in a received
           Router Advertisement message.

   WPD-5:  If the IPv6 CE Router initiates DHCPv6 before receiving a
           Router Advertisement it MUST also request an IA_NA option in
           DHCPv6.

   WPD-6:  If the delegated prefix(es) are aggregate route(s) of
           multiple, more-specific routes, the IPv6 CE router MUST
           discard packets that match the aggregate route(s), but not
           any of the more-specific routes.  In other words, the next-
           hop for the aggregate route(s) should be the null
           destination.  This is necessary to prevent forwarding loops
           when some addresses covered by the aggregate are not
           reachable [RFC4632].

           (a)  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD send an ICMPv6 Destination
                Unreachable according to section 3.1 [RFC4443] back to
                the source of the packet, if the packet is to be dropped
                due to this rule.

   WPD-7:  If the IPv6 CE router requests both an IA_NA and an IA_PD in
           DHCPv6, it MUST accept an IA_PD in DHCPv6 Advertise/Reply
           messages, even if the message does not contain any addresses.

   WPD-8:  By default an IPv6 CE router MUST NOT initiate any dynamic
           routing protocol on its WAN interface.

4.3.  LAN Side Configuration

   The IPv6 CE router distributes configuration information obtained
   during WAN interface provisioning to IPv6 hosts and assists IPv6
   hosts in obtaining IPv6 addresses.  It also supports connectivity of
   these devices in the absence of any working WAN interface.

   An IPv6 CE router is expected to support an IPv6 end-user network and
   IPv6 hosts that exhibit the following characteristics:

   1.  Link-local addresses are insufficient for allowing IPv6
       applications to communicate with each other in the end-user
       network.  The IPv6 CE router will need to enable this

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE router requirements           August 2010


       communication by providing globally-scoped unicast addresses or
       ULAs [RFC4193] whether or not WAN connectivity exists.

   2.  IPv6 hosts should be capable of using SLAAC and may be capable of
       using DHCPv6 for acquiring their addresses.

   3.  IPv6 hosts may use DHCPv6 for other configuration information,
       such as the DNS_SERVERS option for acquiring DNS information.

   Unless otherwise specified, the following requirements apply to the
   IPv6 CE router's LAN interfaces only.

   Requirements:

   L-1:   The IPv6 CE router MUST support ULA addressing [RFC4193].

   L-2:   The IPv6 CE router MUST have a ULA prefix that it maintains
          consistently across reboots.

   L-3:   The value of the ULA prefix SHOULD be user configurable.

   L-4:   By default the IPv6 CE router MUST act as a site border router
          according to section 4.3 of [RFC4193] and filter packets with
          Local IPv6 source or destination addresses accordingly.

   L-5:   The IPv6 CE router MUST support router behavior according to
          Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 [RFC4861].

   L-6:   The IPv6 CE router MUST assign a separate /64 from its
          delegated prefix(es) (and ULA prefix if configured to provide
          ULA addressing) for each of its LAN interfaces.

   L-7:   The IPv6 CE router MUST make each LAN interface an advertising
          interface according to [RFC4861].

   L-8:   In Router Advertisements messages, the Prefix Information
          Option's A and L-flags MUST be set to 1 by default.

   L-9:   The A and L-flags setting SHOULD be user configurable.

   L-10:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support a DHCPv6 server capable of
          IPv6 address assignment according to [RFC3315] OR a stateless
          DHCPv6 server according to [RFC3736] on its LAN interfaces.

   L-11:  Unless the IPv6 CE router is configured to support the DHCPv6
          IA_NA option, it SHOULD set M=0 and O=1 in its Router
          Advertisement messages [RFC4861].

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE router requirements           August 2010


   L-12:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support providing DNS information in
          the DHCPv6 DNS_SERVERS option [RFC3646].

   L-13:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD make available a subset of DHCPv6
          options (as listed in section 5.3 of [RFC3736]) received from
          the DHCPv6 client on its WAN interface to its LAN side DHCPv6
          server.

   L-14:  If the delegated prefix changes, i.e. the current prefix is
          replaced with a new prefix without any overlapping time
          period, then the IPv6 CE router MUST immediately advertise the
          old prefix with a preferred lifetime of 0 and a valid lifetime
          of 2 hours (which must be decremented in real time) in a
          Router Advertisement message.

   L-15:  The IPv6 CE router MUST send an ICMP Destination Unreachable
          Message, code 5 (Source address failed ingress/egress policy)
          for packets forwarded to it using an address from a prefix
          which has been deprecated.

   L-16:  If the IPv6 CE router loses its default route it SHOULD stop
          advertising itself as a default router.  I.e. by setting the
          "Router Lifetime" field to 0 in subsequent Router
          Advertisement messages.

4.4.  Security Considerations

   It is considered a best practice to filter obviously malicious
   traffic (e.g. spoofed packets, "martian" addresses, etc.).  Thus, the
   IPv6 CE router ought to support basic stateless egress and ingress
   filters.  The CE router is also expected to offer mechanisms to
   filter traffic entering the customer network; however, the method by
   which vendors implement configurable packet filtering is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   Security requirements:

   S-1:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD support
         [I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-simple-security].  In particular, the IPv6
         CE router SHOULD support functionality sufficient for
         implementing the set of recommendations in
         [I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-simple-security] section 4.  Ths document
         takes no position on whether such functionality is enabled by
         default or mechanisms by which users would configure it.
