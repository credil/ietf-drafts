Internet-Draft           Sieve Notify: Presence             October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Sometimes, it's desirable to tailor Sieve [RFC5228] notifications to
   a user's current situation.  Presence information provides some
   information about the user that would be useful to have access to in
   these cases.  The Notification extension [RFC5435] defines a
   mechanism to test for presence (the notify_method_capability
   feature), and defines one test for presence (the "online"
   notification-capability, described in Section 5 of RFC 5435).  This
   extension specifies testing of a wider variety of presence
   information.

1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The upper-case key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Testing presence information

   This extension uses the "notify_method_capability" test, as defined
   in the Sieve [RFC5228] Notify extension [RFC5435], to test presence
   information.  When a Sieve event occurs (mail arrives) for a user, a
   Sieve script running on behalf of that user can present the user's
   presence URI (in the "notification-uri" parameter) and test a
   specific item of notification presence as defined below (in the
   "notification-capability" parameter) against one or more values (in
   the "key-list" parameter).

   This document defines the following items of notification presence,
   which may be specified in the notification-capability parameter:

   busy - An indication of whether the user is considered "busy" now
        (the value "yes") or not (the value "no").  The meaning of
        "busy" is left to the implementation, and may be a state that's
        synthesized from other information (including "show", below).

   show - The availability status of the user, formally specified.  Note
        that this is similar to the presence element with the same name
        that's defined in Section 2.2.2.1 of RFC 3921.[RFC3921] The
        value of this item is one of the following:

        away - The user is temporarily away.

Internet-Draft           Sieve Notify: Presence             October 2010


        chat - The user is online and actively interested in chatting.

        dnd  - Do Not Disturb; the user should not be disturbed now.

        offline  - The user is offline.

        xa   - The user is away for an extended period (xa = "eXtended
             Away").

   status  - A human-readable description of the user's availability
        status.  There is no formal definition for the values this item
        may take.  It is free-form, and may be in any language.  Direct
        comparisons against the value of this field are unlikely to be
        useful; rather, it is provided to enable extraction of the value
        into a variable [RFC5229] for use elsewhere (see example 3 in
        Section 3).  Note that this is similar to the presence element
        with the same name that's defined in Section 2.2.2.2 of RFC
        3921.[RFC3921]

   The script tests the values of notification presence items in the
   key-list parameter.  The values that each item may have are specified
   in the list above; in addition, any item may have the value
   "unknown", if it is not possible to determine the correct value of
   the item.

   There is no capability string associated with this extension, but
   this requires support for "enotify".[RFC5435] If the implementation
   does not support the item being tested, RFC 5435 already specifies
   that the test fail without an error.

   Although this feature was conceived to assist in notifications, and
   the test requires support of the Sieve Notify feature, it is only a
   condition test, and any Sieve action can appear inside it.  There are
   no Sieve actions that conflict with this extension.


3.  Examples

   1.  This example will send a notification only if the recipient is
       not "busy".  If the test for "busy" is not supported, this
       example will not send a notification.


   require ["enotify"];

   if notify_method_capability "xmpp:tim@example.com" "busy" "no"
     {
       notify :message "You got mail"

           "xmpp:tim@example.com?message;subject=SIEVE";
     }




   2.  This example will send a notification only if the recipient is
       not "busy".  If the test for "busy" is not supported, this
       example will send a notification.


   require ["enotify"];

   if not notify_method_capability "xmpp:tim@example.com" "busy" "yes"
     {
       notify :message "You got mail"
           "xmpp:tim@example.com?message;subject=SIEVE";
     }




   3.  This example uses the vacation extension [RFC5230] to generate an
       autoreply [I-D.ietf-sieve-autoreply] if the sender is in the
       recipient's address book [I-D.ietf-sieve-external-lists] and the
       recipient's presence shows "extended away".  The variables
       extension [RFC5229] is used to extract the value of the
       recipient's presence status message, which will be used in the
       response to the sender.  If the test for "show" is not supported,
       this example will not send an autoreply.


   require ["extlists", "vacation", "enotify", "variables"];

   if allof (
       envelope :list "from" "tag:example.com,2009-05-28:mylist",
       notify_method_capability "xmpp:myjid@example.com" "show" "xa"
     ) {
       # :matches "*" is used here to extract the value
       if notify_method_capability :matches
           "xmpp:myjid@example.com" "status" "*" {
         set "resp_msg" "${1}";
       } else {
         set "resp_msg" "I'm away from email for a while."
       }
       vacation :handle "ext-away" "${resp_msg}";
     }

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for Sieve [RFC5228] and the Notify extension
   [RFC5435] apply equally here.  In addition, implementations MUST
   ensure that users can not create scripts that access the presence
   information of others without the proper access controls.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This registers each presence item as a notification-capability
   parameter.  Future extensions that add new presence items should
   register those items similarly, using the instructions in Section 9.3
   of RFC 5435.[RFC5435]
