 Proposal for an extension to RTCP for Retransmission Storm Suppression
                             of RTP Stream
             draft-wu-avt-retransmission-supression-rtp-00

Abstract

   This document extends Receiver Summary Information (RSI) report block
   to define a new sub-report block for retransmission suppression
   within the framework of RTP retransmission.  One of initial
   retransmission requests for the missing packets is RTCP NACK.  This
   feedback message conveys packet loss events.  Unlike NACK, this new
   sub-report block, which is referred to as the Retransmission Storm
   Suppression Report, also carries the information regarding
   retransmission suppression early indication events to the receiver
   before the receiver detects an original packet loss and all the
   packet loss repair methods are applied.  By using Retransmission
   Suppression together with NACK, the delay for the receiver to recover
   from the packet loss can be reduced and the risk of increasing
   network congestion can be mitigated or avoided.  This document also
   registers a new sub-report block type for Retransmission Storm
   Suppression within RTP retransmission framework.

Internet-Draft         Retransmission Suppression          February 2010


1.  Introduction

   RTP retransmission is an effective packet loss recovery technique for
   real-time applications with relaxed delay bounds [RFC4588],e.g.,
   streaming media.  The conventional RTCP feedback (NACK) message that
   indicates the sequence number of the lost RTP packets can be used to
   request the retransmission of the missing packets [RFC4585].

   This RTCP NACK message conveys the RTP sequence number of the lost
   packets and request the sender to compensate the missing RTP packets
   based on the RTP sequence number of these packets.  However, in lots
   of multicast environments, packet loss occurs between the media
   sender and the intermediate network element (e.g., Distribution
   Source) due to oversaturated network link, faulty networking hardware
   or corrupted packets rejected in-transit.  It may result in
   retransmission storm targeting at the same sender, i.e., massive
   retransmission request for the same RTP packets through RTCP NACK to
   the same multicast sender.  To increase the robustness to the loss of
   a NACK or of a retransmission packet, a receiver may also send
   multiple NACKs for the same packet.  As the retransmission storm
   progresses, the network is overwhelmed with constant retransmission
   traffic, in the worsening case, RTP retransmission poses a risk of
   increasing network congestion, with excessive traffic and degrading
   network performance, this can eventually lead to a complete loss of
   network connectivity as the retransmission packets proliferate, the
   network may become unusable.

   In order to solve this, the current text in RTCP-SSM allows the
   distribution source to filter out the NACK messages while this
   document propose an option to let the receivers know that NACK is not
   needed in the specified cases. i.e., generating a new RSI sub-report
   block, which reflects the packet receipt/loss events before the
   receiver detects an original packet loss and retransmission
   suppression early indication events before all the packet loss repair
   methods are applied.

   This new RSI sub-report block, which we refer to as Retransmission
   Suppression Early Indication, indicates suppressing requests for
   transmission of lost packets before the receiver sends a NACK for
   those packets.  In order to detect the original packet loss in the
   upstream direction before the receiver perceives it, the distribution
   source located between the sender and receiver may reserve space to
   replicate one copy of multicast data and check the sequence number
   consistency of the original multicast packets.  Also the distribution
   source should take into account such factors as the tolerable
   application delay, the network environment, and the media type.  When
   the packet loss is detected immediately and initial latency is
   tolerable, in the upstream direction towards the sender, the

Internet-Draft         Retransmission Suppression          February 2010


   distribution source may ask for retransmission of the lost packet
   from the sender using RTCP NACK, in the meanwhile, in the downstream
   direction from the sender, the distribution source may convey
   Retransmission Suppression Indication to all the receivers concerned
   to indicate the receiver not to request packet retransmission.  When
   the sender receives the packet retransmission request from the
   distribution source, the sender resends the missing packet to the
   receiver via RTP using retransmission payload format [RFC4588].

   Similar to RTCP NACK, the Retransmission Suppression Early Indication
   also conveys the packet receipt/loss events at the packet level and
   considers missing packets as unrepaired.  But different from RTCP
   NACK, the retransmission Suppression Early Indication is used by the
   intermediate network element to suppress retransmission from the
   receiver and can not be taken as feedback-based error repair
   mechanism but network based packet loss repair method.

   Note that the retransmission suppression Early Indication should
   collectively work together with RTCP NACK to repair the lost source
   packets.  Thus, the delay for the receiver to recover from the packet
   loss can be reduced and the risk of increasing network congestion can
   be mitigated or avoided.  The receive may send a NACK message before
   receiving the indication but will not need to resend the NACK message
   after receiving the indication.  Also the idea of retransmission
   Suppression Early Indication can be further extended when the
   distributed content distribution network are considered.  That is to
   say several distribution sources and media senders may constitute one
   hierarchical model.  In this distributed hierarchical content
   distribution environment, the Retransmission Suppression Early
   Indication not only can be used to suppress all the receivers behind
   itself not to send NACK but also suppress the neighboring nodes not
   to send NACK for the missing packets via unicast.  How the
   neighboring node is discovered is beyond scope of this document.

   This document registers a new sub-report block type for
   Retransmission Storm Suppression within RTP retransmission framework.
   Applications that are employing one or more loss-repair methods MAY
   use retransmission Suppression Early Indication approach together
   with these loss-repair methods for every packet they receive or for a
   set of specific packets they have received.


2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Basic Operation

   The new sub-report block of the retransmission suppression Early
   Indication (RSEI) will work in Simple Feedback and in Distribution
   Source Feedback Summary Models defined in [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm].
   The distribution source will include the support for retransmission
   as part of the offered SDP and will expect such support from the
   Media Sender.

   The distribution source may send this new sub-report block RSEI to
   the receivers when detecting a loss on its incoming link while send a
   NACK to the media sender.  The distribution source may receive NACK
   messages from the receivers and may filter them out if it already
   sent a NACK for the requested packet to the media source.

   If the receiver understands this message it will not send NACKs for
   the missing packets reported in the message and will accept a
   retransmission stream.  The receiver may send NACK messages if it did
   not understand this new message.


4.  Sub-Report Block for Retransmission Suppression Early Indication

   The Retransmission suppression Early Indication (RSEI) sub-report
   block uses the similar format of sub-report block specific to the RSI
   packet defined in the section 7.1.2 of [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm].  The
   report format is shown in Figure 1.  Using this RSEI sub-report block
   with RTCP NACK can efficiently prevent Retransmission Storm to
   happen.  The format of this sub-report block is:

        0                   1                   2                   3

5.  SDP Signaling

   No new parameter needs to be defined for the Retransmission Storm
   Suppression Indication message to be used with Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566]using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234].  It uses the same syntax within the "rtcp-unicast"
   attribute [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm].

   Refer to Section 10.1 of [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm] for a detailed
   description and the full syntax of the "rtcp-unicast" attribute.


6.  IANA Consideration

   New sub-report block types for RTCP RSI block are subject to IANA
   registration.  For general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP
   RSI, refer to [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm].

   This document assigns the sub-report block type (SRBT) value x in the
   RTCP RSI sub-report Block Type Registry to "Retransmission Storm
   Suppression Indication Report Block", with the following
   registrations format:

     Name:           RSEI

Appendix A.  Example scenarios for Retransmission Storm Suppression

A.1.  Scenario 1: One media Sender, one Distribution Source

   The general architecture is displayed below in Figure 2.  In this
   figure, one or more Media Senders send RTP packets to the
   Distribution Source.  The Distribution Source relays the RTP packets
   to the receivers using a source-specific multicast channel.  In the
   reverse direction, the receivers transmit RTCP packets via unicast to
   the distribution source.  The Distribution Source in turn relays RTCP
   packets to the media sender and then transmits the RTCP packets back
   to the receivers, using source-specific multicast.  When packet loss
   happens between Media sender and distribution source, it may result
   in massive retransmission request for the same RTP packets from all
   the receivers using RTCP NACK to the same multicast sender.  We refer
   to it as Retransmission Storm.

A.2.  Scenario 2: One Media Sender, more distribution sources

   The hierarchical model is displayed below in Figure 3.  In this
   figure, one media sender and two Distribution source constitute one
   hierarchical model.  In this model, one Media Senders send RTP
   packets to two Distribution Sources respectively.  These Distribution
   Sources relay the RTP packets respectively to the receivers behind
   itself using a source-specific multicast channel.  In the reverse
   direction, the receivers transmit RTCP packets via unicast to the
   distribution source.  The Distribution Source in turn relays RTCP
   packets to the media sender and then transmits the RTCP packets back
   to the receivers, using source-specific multicast.  When packet loss
   happens between Media sender and distribution source, it may result
   in massive retransmission request for the same RTP packets from all
   the receivers using RTCP NACK to the same multicast sender.  We refer

Appendix B.  Applicability of Retransmission Suppression Early
             Indication

   This document defines new RTCP RSI sub-report block, which we refer
   to as Retransmission Suppression Early Indication to deal with
   Retransmission Storm mentioned above.  Here we give two examples to
   show how this new RTCP sub-report block is applied into two scenarios
   described in section A.1 for Retransmission Storm Suppression.

   Applicability of Retransmission Storm Suppression in Scenario 1
   described in Figure 2 is shown in the Figure 4.  In this figure, the
   distribution source detect the packet loss before the receiver
   perceive it and ask for retransmission of the missing packets from
   the media sender, in the meanwhile, the distribution source transmits
   the RTCP Retransmission Storm Suppression Indication back to the
   receivers using source-specific multicast channel.  In this way, the

   delay for the receiver to recover from the packet loss can be reduced
   and the risk of increasing network congestion can be mitigated.

   Applicability of Retransmission Storm Suppression in Scenario 2
   described in Figure 3 is shown in the figure A.2.2.  The procedure in
   the figure A.2.2 is similar to the one in the figure Figure 5.  The
   only difference is distribution source should not only notify all the
   receiver behind itself not to send NACK but also propagate the
   retransmission suppression indication to the neighboring distribution
   sources.  In this way, all the receivers behind all the neighboring
   distribution source can avoid sending massive retransmission request
   to the media sender.
