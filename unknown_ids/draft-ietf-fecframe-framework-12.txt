                Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework
                    draft-ietf-fecframe-framework-12

Abstract

   This document describes a framework for using Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) codes with applications in public and private IP
   networks to provide protection against packet loss.  The framework
   supports applying FEC to arbitrary packet flows over unreliable
   transport and is primarily intended for real-time, or streaming,
   media.  This framework can be used to define Content Delivery
   Protocols that provide FEC for streaming media delivery or other
   packet flows.  Content Delivery Protocols defined using this
   framework can support any FEC scheme (and associated FEC codes) which
   is compliant with various requirements defined in this document.
   Thus, Content Delivery Protocols can be defined which are not
   specific to a particular FEC scheme, and FEC schemes can be defined
   which are not specific to a particular Content Delivery Protocol.

Internet-Draft                FEC Framework                 January 2011


1.  Introduction

   Many applications have a requirement to transport a continuous stream
   of packetized data from a source (sender) to one or more destinations
   (receivers) over networks which do not provide guaranteed packet
   delivery.  Primary examples are real-time, or streaming, media
   applications such as broadcast, multicast or on-demand audio, video
   or multimedia.

   Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a well-known technique for
   improving reliability of packet transmission over networks which do
   not provide guaranteed packet delivery, especially in multicast and
   broadcast applications.  The FEC Building Block defined in [RFC5052]
   provides a framework for definition of Content Delivery Protocols
   (CDPs) for object delivery (including, primarily, file delivery)
   which make use of separately defined FEC schemes.  Any CDP defined
   according to the requirements of the FEC Building Block can then
   easily be used with any FEC scheme which is also defined according to
   the requirements of the FEC Building Block.

   Note that the term "Forward Erasure Correction" is sometimes used,
   erasures being a type of error in which data is lost and this loss
   can be detected, rather than being received in corrupted form.  The
   focus of this document is strictly on erasures and, the term "Forward
   Error Correction" is more widely used.

   This document defines a framework for the definition of CDPs which
   provide for FEC protection for arbitrary packet flows over unreliable
   transports such as UDP.  As such, this document complements the FEC
   Building Block of [RFC5052], by providing for the case of arbitrary
   packet flows over unreliable transport, the same kind of framework as
   that document provides for object delivery.  This document does not
   define a complete CDP, but rather defines only those aspects that are
   expected to be common to all CDPs based on this framework.

   This framework does not define how the flows to be protected are
   determined, nor how the details of the protected flows and the FEC
   streams which protect them are communicated from sender to receiver.
   It is expected that any complete CDP specification which makes use of
   this framework will address these signaling requirements.  However,
   this document does specify the information which is required by the
   FEC Framework at the sender and receiver, e.g., details of the flows
   to be FEC protected, the flow(s) that will carry the FEC protection
   data and an opaque container for FEC-Scheme-Specific Information.

   FEC schemes designed for use with this framework must fulfill a
   number of requirements defined in this document.  These requirements
   are different from those defined in [RFC5052] for FEC schemes for

   object delivery.  However, there is a great deal of commonality and
   FEC schemes defined for object delivery may be easily adapted for use
   with the framework defined in this document.

   Since the RTP protocol is (often) used over UDP, this framework can
   be applied to RTP flows as well.  FEC repair packets may be sent
   directly over UDP or RTP.  The latter approach has the advantage that
   RTP instrumentation, based on RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), can be
   used for the repair flow.  Additionally, the post-repair RTCP
   extended reports [RFC5725] may be used to obtain information about
   the loss rate after FEC recovery.

   The use of RTP for repair flows is defined for each FEC scheme by
   defining an RTP payload format for that particular FEC scheme
   (possibly in the same document).

2.  Definitions and Abbreviations

   Application Data Unit (ADU): The unit of source data provided as
   payload to the transport layer.

   ADU Flow: A sequence of ADUs associated with a transport-layer flow
   identifier (such as the standard 5-tuple {Source IP address, source
   port, destination IP address, destination port, transport protocol}).

   AL-FEC: Application-layer Forward Error Correction.

   Application Protocol: Control protocol used to establish and control
   the source flow being protected, e.g., RTSP.

   Content Delivery Protocol (CDP): A complete application protocol
   specification which, through the use of the framework defined in this
   document, is able to make use of FEC schemes to provide FEC
   capabilities.

   FEC Code: An algorithm for encoding data such that the encoded data
   flow is resilient to data loss.  Note that in general FEC codes may
   also be used to make a data flow resilient to corruption, but that is
   not considered in this document.

   FEC Framework: A protocol framework for definition of Content
   Delivery Protocols using FEC, such as the framework defined in this
   document.

   FEC Framework Configuration Information: Information which controls
   the operation of the FEC Framework.

   with respect to the FEC scheme.

   FEC Repair Packet: At a sender (respectively, at a receiver) a
   payload submitted to (respectively, received from) the transport
   protocol containing one or more repair symbols along with a Repair
   FEC Payload ID and possibly an RTP header.

   FEC Scheme: A specification which defines the additional protocol
   aspects required to use a particular FEC code with the FEC Framework.

   FEC Source Packet: At a sender (respectively, at a receiver) a

   of FEC.

   Repair Flow: The packet flow carrying FEC data.

   Repair FEC Payload ID: An FEC Payload ID specifically for use with
   repair packets.

   Source Flow: The packet flow to which FEC protection is to be
   applied.  A source flow consists of ADUs.

   Source FEC Payload ID: An FEC Payload ID specifically for use with
   source packets.

   Source Protocol: A protocol used for the source flow being protected,
   e.g., RTP.

   Transport Protocol: The protocol used for transport of the source and
   repair flows, e.g., UDP and DCCP.

   The following definitions are aligned with [RFC5052]:

   Code Rate: The ratio between the number of source symbols and the
   number of encoding symbols.  By definition, the code rate is such
   that 0 < code rate <= 1.  A code rate close to 1 indicates that a
   small number of repair symbols have been produced during the encoding
   process.

   Encoding Symbol: Unit of data generated by the encoding process.
   With systematic codes, source symbols are part of the encoding
   symbols.

   Packet Erasure Channel: A communication path where packets are either
   dropped (e.g., by a congested router, or because the number of
   transmission errors exceeds the correction capabilities of the
   physical-layer codes) or received.  When a packet is received, it is
   assumed that this packet is not corrupted.

   Repair Symbol: Encoding symbol that is not a source symbol.

   Source Block: Group of ADUs which are to be FEC protected as a single
   block.

   Source Symbol: Unit of data used during the encoding process.

   Systematic Code: FEC code in which the source symbols are part of the
   encoding symbols.

3.  Architecture Overview

   The FEC Framework is described in terms of an additional layer
   between the transport layer (e.g., UDP or DCCP) and protocols running
   over this transport layer.  As such, the data path interface between
   the FEC Framework and both underlying and overlying layers can be
   thought of as being the same as the standard interface to the
   transport layer, i.e., the data exchanged consists of datagram
   payloads each associated with a single ADU flow identified by the
   standard 5-tuple {Source IP address, source port, destination IP
   address, destination port, transport protocol}.  In the case that RTP
   is used for the repair flows, the source and repair data can be
   multiplexed using RTP onto a single UDP flow and needs to be
   consequently demultiplexed at the receiver.  There are various ways
   in which this multiplexing can be done, for example as described in
   [RFC4588].

   It is important to understand that the main purpose of the FEC
   Framework architecture is to allocate functional responsibilities to
   separately documented components in such a way that specific
   instances of the components can be combined in different ways to
   describe different protocols.

   The FEC Framework makes use of an FEC scheme, in a similar sense to
   that defined in [RFC5052] and uses the terminology of that document.
   The FEC scheme defines the FEC encoding and decoding, and defines the
   protocol fields and procedures used to identify packet payload data
   in the context of the FEC scheme.  The interface between the FEC
   Framework and an FEC scheme, which is described in this document, is
   a logical one, which exists for specification purposes only.  At an
   encoder, the FEC Framework passes ADUs to the FEC scheme for FEC
   encoding.  The FEC scheme returns repair symbols with their
   associated Repair FEC Payload IDs, and in some cases Source FEC
   Payload IDs, depending on the FEC scheme.  At a decoder, the FEC
   Framework passes transport packet payloads (source and repair) to the
   FEC scheme and the FEC scheme returns additional recovered source
   packet payloads.

   This document defines certain FEC Framework Configuration Information
   which MUST be available to both sender and receiver(s).  For example,
   this information includes the specification of the ADU flows which
   are to be FEC protected, specification of the ADU flow(s) which will
   carry the FEC protection (repair) data and the relationship(s)
   between these source and repair flows (i.e., which source flow(s) are
   protected by each repair flow(s)).  The FEC Framework Configuration
   Information also includes information fields which are specific to
   the FEC scheme.  This information is analogous to the FEC Object
   Transmission Information defined in [RFC5052].

Internet-Draft                FEC Framework                 January 2011


   The FEC Framework does not define how the FEC Framework Configuration
   Information for the stream is communicated from sender to receiver.
   This has to be defined by any CDP specification as described in the
   following sections.

   In this architecture we assume that the interface to the transport
   layer supports the concepts of data units (referred to here as
   Application Data Units (ADUs)) to be transported and identification
   of ADU flows on which those data units are transported.  Since this
   is an interface internal to the architecture, we do not specify this
   interface explicitly.  We do require that ADU flows which are
   distinct from the transport layer point of view (for example,
   distinct UDP flows as identified by the UDP source/destination
   addresses/ports) are also distinct on the interface between the
   transport layer and the FEC Framework.

   As noted above, RTP flows are a specific example of ADU flows which
   might be protected by the FEC Framework.  From the FEC Framework
   point of view, RTP source flows are ADU flows like any other, with
   the RTP header included within the ADU.

   Depending on the FEC scheme, RTP can also be used as a transport for
   repair packet flows.  In this case an FEC scheme has to define an RTP
   payload format for the repair data.

   The architecture outlined above is illustrated in the Figure 1.  In
   this architecture, two (optional) RTP instances are shown, for the
   source and repair data respectively.  This is because the use of RTP
   for the source data is separate from and independent of the use of
   RTP for the repair data.  The appearance of two RTP instances is more
   natural when one considers that in many FEC codes, the repair payload
   contains repair data calculated across the RTP headers of the source
   packets.  Thus, a repair packet carried over RTP starts with an RTP
   header of its own which is followed (after the Repair Payload ID) by
   repair data containing bytes which protect the source RTP headers (as
   well as repair data for the source RTP payloads).

   The content of the transport payload for repair packets is fully
   defined by the FEC scheme.  For a specific FEC scheme, a means MAY be
   defined for repair data to be carried over RTP, in which case the
   repair packet payload format starts with the RTP header.  This

   corresponds to defining an RTP payload format for the specific FEC
   scheme.

   The use of RTP for repair packets is independent of the protocols
   used for source packets: if RTP is used for source packets, repair
   packets may or may not use RTP and vice versa (although it is
   unlikely that there are useful scenarios where non-RTP source flows
   are protected by RTP repair flows).  FEC schemes are expected to
   recover entire transport payloads for recovered source packets in all

   is expected to recover the entire UDP payload, including the RTP
   header.

Internet-Draft                FEC Framework                 January 2011


4.  Procedural Overview

4.1.  General

   The mechanism defined in this document does not place any
   restrictions on the ADUs which can be protected together, except that
   the ADU is carried over a supported transport protocol (See
   Section 7).  The data can be from multiple source flows that are
   protected jointly.  The FEC Framework handles the source flows as a
   sequence of source blocks each consisting of a set of ADUs, possibly
   from multiple source flows which are to be protected together.  For
   example, each source block can be constructed from those ADUs related
   to a particular segment in time of the flow.

   At the sender, the FEC Framework passes the payloads for a given
   block to the FEC scheme for FEC encoding.  The FEC scheme performs
   the FEC encoding operation and returns the following information:

   o  Optionally, FEC Payload IDs for each of the source payloads
      (encoded according to an FEC-Scheme-Specific format).

   o  One or more FEC repair packet payloads.

   o  FEC Payload IDs for each of the repair packet payloads (encoded
      according to an FEC-Scheme-Specific format).

   The FEC Framework then performs two operations.  First, it appends
   the Source FEC Payload IDs, if provided, to each of the ADUs, and
   sends the resulting packets, known as FEC source packets, to the
   receiver, and second it places the provided FEC repair packet
   payloads and corresponding Repair FEC Payload IDs appropriately to
   construct FEC repair packets and send them to the receiver.

   This document does not define how the sender determines which ADUs
   are included in which source blocks or the sending order and timing
   of FEC source and repair packets.  A specific CDP MAY define this
   mapping or it MAY be left as implementation dependent at the sender.
   However, a CDP specification MUST define how a receiver determines a
   minimum length of time that it needs to wait to receive FEC repair
   packets for any given source block.  FEC schemes MAY define
   limitations on this mapping, such as maximum size of source blocks,
   but SHOULD NOT attempt to define specific mappings.  The sequence of
   operations at the sender is described in more detail in Section 4.2.

   At the receiver, original ADUs are recovered by the FEC Framework
   directly from any FEC source packets received simply by removing the
   Source FEC Payload ID, if present.  The receiver also passes the
   contents of the received ADUs, plus their FEC Payload IDs to the FEC

   scheme for possible decoding.

   If any ADUs related to a given source block have been lost, then the
   FEC scheme can perform FEC decoding to recover the missing ADUs
   (assuming sufficient FEC source and repair packets related to that
   source block have been received).

   Note that the receiver might need to buffer received source packets
   to allow time for the FEC repair packets to arrive and FEC decoding
   to be performed before some or all of the received or recovered
   packets are passed to the application.  If such a buffer is not
   provided, then the application has to be able to deal with the severe
   re-ordering of packets that can occur.  However, such buffering is
   CDP and/or implementation-specific and is not specified here.  The
   receiver operation is described in more detail in Section 4.3.

   The FEC source packets MUST contain information which identifies the
   source block and the position within the source block (in terms
   specific to the FEC scheme) occupied by the ADU.  This information is
   known as the Source FEC Payload ID.  The FEC scheme is responsible
   for defining and interpreting this information.  This information MAY
   be encoded into a specific field within the FEC source packet format
   defined in this specification, called the Explicit Source FEC Payload
   ID field.  The exact contents and format of the Explicit Source FEC
   Payload ID field are defined by the FEC schemes.  Alternatively, the
   FEC scheme MAY define how the Source FEC Payload ID is derived from
   other fields within the source packets.  This document defines the
   way that the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID field is appended to
   source packets to form FEC source packets.

   The FEC repair packets MUST contain information which identifies the
   source block and the relationship between the contained repair
   payloads and the original source block.  This is known as the Repair
   FEC Payload ID.  This information MUST be encoded into a specific
   field, the Repair FEC Payload ID field, the contents and format of
   which are defined by the FEC schemes.

   The FEC scheme MAY use different FEC Payload ID field formats for
   source and repair packets.

4.2.  Sender Operation

   It is assumed that the sender has constructed or received original
   data packets for the session.  These could be carrying any type of
   data.  The following operations, illustrated in Figure 2, for the
   case of UDP repair flows and Figure 3 for the case of RTP repair
   flows, describe a possible way to generate compliant source and
   repair flows:

   1.  ADUs are provided by the application.

   2.  A source block is constructed as specified in Section 5.2.

   3.  The source block is passed to the FEC scheme for FEC encoding.
       The Source FEC Payload ID information of each source packet is
       determined by the FEC scheme.  If required by the FEC scheme the
       Source FEC Payload ID is encoded into the Explicit Source FEC
       Payload ID field.

   4.  The FEC scheme performs FEC encoding, generating repair packet
       payloads from a source block and a Repair FEC Payload ID field
       for each repair payload.

   5.  The Explicit Source FEC Payload IDs (if used), Repair FEC Payload
       IDs and repair packet payloads are provided back from the FEC
       scheme to the FEC Framework.

   6.  The FEC Framework constructs FEC source packets according to
       Section 5.3 and FEC repair packets according to Section 5.4 using
       the FEC Payload IDs and repair packet payloads provided by the
       FEC scheme.

   7.  The FEC source and repair packets are sent using normal
       transport-layer procedures.  The port(s) and multicast group(s)
       to be used for FEC repair packets are defined in the FEC
       Framework Configuration Information.  The FEC source packets are
       sent using the same ADU flow identification information as would
       have been used for the original source packets if the FEC
       Framework were not present (for example, in the UDP case, the UDP
       source and destination addresses and ports on the IP datagram
       carrying the source packet will be the same whether or not the
       FEC Framework is applied).

4.3.  Receiver Operation

   The following describes a possible receiver algorithm, illustrated in
   Figure 4 and Figure 5 for the case of RTP repair flows, when
   receiving an FEC source or repair packet:

   1.  FEC source packets and FEC repair packets are received and passed
       to the FEC Framework.  The type of packet (source or repair) and
       the source flow to which it belongs (in the case of source
       packets) is indicated by the ADU flow information which
       identifies the flow at the transport layer.

       In the special case that RTP is used for repair packets, and
       source and repair packets are multiplexed onto the same UDP flow,
       then RTP demultiplexing is required to demultiplex source and

       repair flows.  However, RTP processing is applied only to the
       repair packets at this stage; source packets continue to be
       handled as UDP payloads (i.e., including their RTP headers).

   2.  The FEC Framework extracts the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID
       field (if present) from the source packets and the Repair FEC
       Payload ID from the repair packets.

   3.  The Explicit Source FEC Payload IDs (if present), Repair FEC
       Payload IDs, FEC source and repair payloads are passed to the FEC
       scheme.

   4.  The FEC scheme uses the received FEC Payload IDs (and derived FEC
       Source Payload IDs in the case that the Explicit Source FEC
       Payload ID field is not used) to group source and repair packets
       into source blocks.  If at least one source packet is missing
       from a source block, and at least one repair packet has been
       received for the same source block then FEC decoding can be
       performed in order to recover missing source payloads.  The FEC
       scheme determines whether source packets have been lost and
       whether enough data for decoding of any or all of the missing
       source payloads in the source block has been received.

   5.  The FEC scheme returns the ADUs to the FEC Framework in the form
       of source blocks containing received and decoded ADUs and
       indications of any ADUs which were missing and could not be
       decoded.

   6.  The FEC Framework passes the received and recovered ADUs to the
       application.

   The description above defines functionality responsibilities but does
   not imply a specific set of timing relationships.  Source packets
   which are correctly received and those which are reconstructed MAY be
   delivered to the application out of order and in a different order
   from the order of arrival at the receiver.  Alternatively, buffering
   and packet re-ordering MAY be applied to re-order received and
   reconstructed source packets into the order they were placed into the
   source block, if that is necessary according to the application.

Internet-Draft                FEC Framework                 January 2011


5.  Protocol Specification

5.1.  General

   This section specifies the protocol elements for the FEC Framework.
   Three components of the protocol are defined in this document and are
   described in the following sections:

   1.  Construction of a source block from ADUs.  The FEC code will be
       applied to this source block to produce the repair payloads.

   2.  A format for packets containing source data.

   3.  A format for packets containing repair data.

   The operation of the FEC Framework is governed by certain FEC
   Framework Configuration Information, which is defined in this
   section.  A complete protocol specification that uses this framework
   MUST specify the means to determine and communicate this information
   between sender and receiver.

5.2.  Structure of the Source Block

   The FEC Framework and FEC scheme exchange ADUs in the form of source
   blocks.  A source block is generated by the FEC Framework from an
   ordered sequence of ADUs.  The allocation of ADUs to blocks is
   dependent on the application.  Note that some ADUs may not be
   included in any block.  Each source block provided to the FEC scheme
   consists of an ordered sequence of ADUs where the following
   information is provided for each ADU:

   o  A description of the source flow with which the ADU is associated
      with.

   o  The ADU itself.

   o  The length of the ADU.

5.3.  Packet Format for FEC Source Packets

   The packet format for FEC source packets MUST be used to transport
   the payload of an original source packet.  As depicted in Figure 6,
   it consists of the original packet, optionally followed by the
   Explicit Source FEC Payload ID field.  The FEC scheme determines
   whether the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID field is required.  This
   determination is specific to each ADU flow.

                   +------------------------------------+

    Figure 6: Structure of the FEC packet format for FEC source packets

   The FEC source packets MUST be sent using the same ADU flow as would
   have been used for the original source packets if the FEC Framework
   were not present.  The transport payload of the FEC source packet
   MUST consist of the ADU followed by the Explicit Source FEC Payload
   ID field, if required.

   The Explicit Source FEC Payload ID field contains information
   required to associate the source packet with a source block and for
   the operation of the FEC algorithm, and is defined by the FEC scheme.
   The format of the Source FEC Payload ID field is defined by the FEC
   scheme.  In the case that the FEC scheme or CDP defines a means to
   derive the Source FEC Payload ID from other information in the packet
   (for example a sequence number used by the application protocol),
   then the Source FEC Payload ID field is not included in the packet.
   In this case, the original source packet and FEC source packet are
   identical.

   In applications where avoidance of IP packet fragmentation is a goal,
   CDPs SHOULD consider the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID size when
   determining the size of ADUs that will be delivered using the FEC
   Framework.  This is because the addition of the Explicit Source FEC
   Payload ID increases the packet length.

   The Explicit Source FEC Payload ID is placed at the end of the packet
   so that in the case that Robust Header Compression (ROHC) [RFC3095]
   or other header compression mechanisms are used and in the case that
   a ROHC profile is defined for the protocol carried within the
   transport payload (for example RTP), then ROHC will still be applied
   for the FEC source packets.  Applications that are used with this
   framework need to consider that FEC schemes can add this Explicit
   Source FEC Payload ID and thereby increase the packet size.

   In many applications, support for FEC is added to a pre-existing
   protocol and in this case use of the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID
   can break backwards compatibility, since source packets are modified.

5.3.1.  Generic Explicit Source FEC Payload ID

   In order to apply FEC protection using multiple FEC schemes to a
   single source flow, all schemes have to use the same Explicit Source
   FEC Payload ID format.  In order to enable this, it is RECOMMENDED
   that FEC schemes support the Generic Explicit Source FEC Payload ID
   format described below.

   The Generic Explicit Source FEC Payload ID has a length of two octets
   and consists of an unsigned packet sequence number in network-byte
   order.  The allocation of sequence numbers to packets is independent
   of any FEC scheme and of the source block construction, except that
   the use of this sequence number places a constraint on source block
   construction.  Source packets within a given source block MUST have
   consecutive sequence numbers (where consecutive includes wrap-around
   from the maximum value which can be represented in two octets (65535)
   to 0).  Sequence numbers SHOULD NOT be reused until all values in the
   sequence number space have been used.

5.4.  Packet Format for FEC Repair Packets

   The packet format for FEC repair packets is shown in Figure 7.  The
   transport payload consists of a Repair FEC Payload ID field followed
   by repair data generated in the FEC encoding process.

                Figure 7: Packet format for repair packets

   The Repair FEC Payload ID field contains information required for the
   operation of the FEC algorithm at the receiver.  This information is
   defined by the FEC scheme.  The format of the Repair FEC Payload ID
   field is defined by the FEC scheme.

5.4.1.  Packet Format for FEC Repair Packets over RTP

   For FEC schemes which specify the use of RTP for repair packets, the
   packet format for repair packets includes an RTP header as shown in
   Figure 8.

5.5.  FEC Framework Configuration Information

   The FEC Framework Configuration Information is information that the
   FEC Framework needs in order to apply FEC protection to the ADU
   flows.  A complete CDP specification that uses the framework
   specified here MUST include details of how this information is
   derived and communicated between sender and receiver.

   The FEC Framework Configuration Information includes identification
   of the set of source flows.  For example, in the case of UDP, each
   source flow is uniquely identified by a tuple {Source IP address,
   source UDP port, destination IP address, destination UDP port}.  In
   some applications some of these fields can contain wildcards, so that
   the flow is identified by a subset of the fields.  In particular, in
   many applications the limited tuple {Destination IP address,
   destination UDP port} is sufficient.

   A single instance of the FEC Framework provides FEC protection for
   packets of the specified set of source flows, by means of one or more
   packet flows consisting of repair packets.  The FEC Framework
   Configuration Information includes, for each instance of the FEC
   Framework:

   1.  Identification of the repair flows.

   2.  For each source flow protected by the repair flow(s):

       A.  Definition of the source flow.

       B.  An integer identifier for this flow definition (i.e., tuple).
           This identifier MUST be unique amongst all source flows that
           are protected by the same FEC repair flow.  Integer
           identifiers can be allocated starting from zero and
           increasing by one for each flow.  However, any random (but



Watson, et al.            Expires July 22, 2011                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft                FEC Framework                 January 2011


           still unique) allocation is also possible.  A source flow
           identifier need not be carried in source packets since source
           packets are directly associated with a flow by virtue of
           their packet headers.

   3.  The FEC Encoding ID, identifying the FEC scheme.

   4.  The length of the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID (in octets).

   5.  Zero or more FEC-Scheme-Specific Information (FSSI) elements,
       each consisting of a name and a value where the valid element
       names and value ranges are defined by the FEC scheme.

   Multiple instances of the FEC Framework, with separate and
   independent FEC Framework Configuration Information, can be present
   at a sender or receiver.  A single instance of the FEC Framework
   protects packets of the source flows identified in (2) above, i.e.,
   all packets sent on those flows MUST be FEC source packets as defined
   in Section 5.3.  A single source flow can be protected by multiple
   instances of the FEC Framework.

   The integer flow identifier identified in (2b) above is a shorthand
   to identify source flows between the FEC Framework and the FEC
   scheme.  The reason for defining this as an integer, and including it
   in the FEC Framework Configuration Information is so that the FEC
   scheme at the sender and receiver can use it to identify the source
   flow with which a recovered packet is associated.  The integer flow
   identifier can therefore take the place of the complete flow
   description (e.g., UDP 4-tuple).

   Whether and how this flow identifier is used is defined by the FEC
   scheme.  Since repair packets can provide protection for multiple
   source flows, repair packets would either not carry the identifier at
   all or can carry multiple identifiers.  However, in any case, the
   flow identifier associated with a particular source packet can be
   recovered from the repair packets as part of an FEC decoding
   operation.

   A single FEC repair flow provides repair packets for a single
   instance of the FEC Framework.  Other packets MUST NOT be sent within
   this flow, i.e., all packets in the FEC repair flow MUST be FEC
   repair packets as defined in Section 5.4 and MUST relate to the same
   FEC Framework instance.

   In the case that RTP is used for repair packets, the identification
   of the repair packet flow can also include the RTP payload type to be
   used for repair packets.

   FSSI includes the information that is specific to the FEC scheme used
   by the CDP.  FSSI is used to communicate the information that cannot
   be adequately represented otherwise and is essential for proper FEC
   encoding and decoding operations.  The motivation behind separating
   the FSSI required only by the sender (which is carried in Sender-Side
   FEC-Scheme-Specific Information (SS-FSSI) container) from the rest of
   the FSSI is to provide the receiver or the third party entities a
   means of controlling the FEC operations at the sender.  Any FSSI
   other than the one solely required by the sender MUST be communicated
   via the FSSI container.

   The variable-length SS-FSSI and FSSI containers transmit the
   information in textual representation and contain zero or more
   distinct elements, whose descriptions are provided by the fully-
   specified FEC schemes.

   For the CDPs that choose the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566] as their session description protocol, the ABNF [RFC5234]
   syntax for the SS-FSSI and FSSI containers is provided in Section 4.5
   of [I-D.ietf-fecframe-sdp-elements].

5.6.  FEC Scheme Requirements

   In order to be used with this framework, an FEC scheme MUST be
   capable of processing data arranged into blocks of ADUs (source
   blocks).

   A specification for a new FEC scheme MUST include the following:

   1.  The FEC Encoding ID value that uniquely identifies the FEC
       scheme.  This value MUST be registered with IANA as described in
       Section 11.

   2.  The type, semantics and encoding format of the Repair FEC Payload
       ID.

   3.  The name, type, semantics and text value encoding rules for zero
       or more FEC-Scheme-Specific Information elements.

   4.  A full specification of the FEC code.

       This specification MUST precisely define the valid FEC-Scheme-
       Specific Information values, the valid FEC Payload ID values and
       the valid packet payload sizes (where packet payload refers to
       the space within a packet dedicated to carrying encoding
       symbols).

       Furthermore, given a source block as defined in Section 5.2,



Watson, et al.            Expires July 22, 2011                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft                FEC Framework                 January 2011


       valid values of the FEC-Scheme-Specific Information, a valid
       Repair FEC Payload ID value and a valid packet payload size, the
       specification MUST uniquely define the values of the encoding
       symbols to be included in the repair packet payload of a packet
       with the given Repair FEC Payload ID value.

       A common and simple way to specify the FEC code to the required
       level of detail is to provide a precise specification of an
       encoding algorithm which, given a source block, valid values of
       the FEC-Scheme-Specific Information, a valid Repair FEC Payload
       ID value and a valid packet payload size as input produces the
       exact value of the encoding symbols as output.

   5.  A description of practical encoding and decoding algorithms.

       This description need not be to the same level of detail as for
       the encoding above, however it has to be sufficient to
       demonstrate that encoding and decoding of the code is both
       possible and practical.

   FEC scheme specifications MAY additionally define the following:

   1.  Type, semantics and encoding format of an Explicit Source FEC
       Payload ID.

   Whenever an FEC scheme specification defines an 'encoding format' for
   an element, this has to be defined in terms of a sequence of bytes
   which can be embedded within a protocol.  The length of the encoding
   format MUST either be fixed or it MUST be possible to derive the
   length from examining the encoded bytes themselves.  For example, the
   initial bytes can include some kind of length indication.

   FEC scheme specifications SHOULD use the terminology defined in this
   document and SHOULD follow the following format:

   1. Introduction  <Describe the use-cases addressed by this FEC
      scheme>


   2. Formats and Codes

      2.1 Source FEC Payload ID(s)  <Either, define the type and format
         of the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID, or define how Source FEC
         Payload ID information is derived from source packets>

         Repair FEC Payload ID>

      2.3 FEC Framework Configuration Information  <Define the names,
         types and text value encoding formats of the FEC-Scheme-
         Specific Information elements>

   3. Procedures  <Describe any procedures which are specific to this
      FEC scheme, in particular derivation and interpretation of the
      fields in the FEC Payload IDs and FEC-Scheme-Specific Information>

   4. FEC Code Specification  <Provide a complete specification of the
      FEC Code>

   Specifications can include additional sections including examples.

   Each FEC scheme MUST be specified independently of all other FEC
   schemes; for example, in a separate specification or a completely
   independent section of larger specification (except, of course, a
   specification of one FEC scheme can include portions of another by
   reference).  Where an RTP Payload Format is defined for repair data
   for a specific FEC scheme, the RTP Payload Format and the FEC scheme
   can be specified within the same document.

Internet-Draft                FEC Framework                 January 2011


6.  Feedback

   Many applications require some kind of feedback on transport
   performance.  E.g., how much data arrived at the receiver, at what
   rate and when?  When FEC is added to such applications, feedback
   mechanisms can also need to be enhanced to report on the performance
   of the FEC.  E.g., how much lost data was recovered by the FEC?

   When used to provide instrumentation for engineering purposes, it is
   important to remember that FEC is generally applied to relatively
   small blocks of data (in the sense that each block is transmitted
   over a relatively small period of time).  Thus, feedback information
   that is averaged over longer periods of time will likely not provide
   sufficient information for engineering purposes.  More detailed
   feedback over shorter time scales might be preferred.  For example,
   for applications using RTP transport, see [RFC5725].

   Applications which used feedback for congestion control purposes MUST
   calculate such feedback on the basis of packets received before FEC
   recovery is applied.  If this requirement conflicts with other uses
   of the feedback information then the application MUST be enhanced to
   support both information calculated pre- and post- FEC recovery.
   This is to ensure that congestion control mechanisms operate
   correctly based on congestion indications received from the network,
   rather than on post-FEC recovery information which would give an
   inaccurate picture of congestion conditions.

   New applications which require such feedback SHOULD use RTP/RTCP
   [RFC3550].

   over transport protocols providing an unreliable datagram service,
   including in particular the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and the
   Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).

8.  Congestion Control

   This section starts with some informative background on the
   motivation of the normative requirements for congestion control,
   which are spelled out in Section 8.2.

8.1.  Motivation

   o  The enforcement of congestion control principles has gained a lot
      of momentum in the IETF over the recent years.  While the need for
      congestion control over the open Internet is unquestioned, and the
      goal of TCP friendliness is generally agreed for most (but not
      all) applications, the subject of congestion detection and
      measurement in heterogeneous networks can hardly be considered as
      solved.  Most congestion control algorithms detect and measure
      congestion by taking (primarily or exclusively) the packet loss
      rate into account.  This appears to be inappropriate in
      environments where a large percentage of the packet losses are the
      result of link-layer errors and independent of the network load.

   o  The authors of this document are primarily interested in
      applications where the application reliability requirements and
      end-to-end reliability of the network differ, such that it
      warrants higher-layer protection of the packet stream, e.g., due
      to the presence of unreliable links in the end-to-end path and
      where real-time, scalability or other constraints prohibit the use
      of higher-layer (transport or application) feedback.  A typical
      example for such applications is multicast and broadcast streaming
      or multimedia transmission over heterogeneous networks.  In other
      cases, application reliability requirements can be so high that
      the required end-to-end reliability will be difficult to achieve.
      Furthermore, the end-to-end network reliability is not necessarily
      known in advance.

   o  This FEC Framework is not defined, nor intended, as a QoS
      enhancement tool to combat losses resulting from highly congested
      networks.  It should not be used for such purposes.

   o  In order to prevent such mis-use, one approach is to leave
      standardization to bodies most concerned with the problem
      described above.  However, the IETF defines base standards used by
      several bodies, including DVB, 3GPP, 3GPP2, all of which appear to
      share the environment and the problem described.

   o  Another approach is to write a clear applicability statement.  For
      example, one could restrict the use of this framework to networks
      with certain loss characteristics (e.g., wireless links).
      However, there can be applications where the use of FEC is



Watson, et al.            Expires July 22, 2011                [Page 31]

Internet-Draft                FEC Framework                 January 2011


      justified to combat congestion-induced packet losses -
      particularly in lightly loaded networks, where congestion is the
      result of relatively rare random peaks in instantaneous traffic
      load - thereby intentionally violating congestion control
      principles.  One possible example for such an application could be
      a no-matter-what, brute-force FEC protection of a traffic
      generated as an emergency signal.

   o  A third approach is to require at a minimum that the use of this
      framework with any given application, in any given environment,
      does not cause congestion issues which the application alone would
      not itself cause, i.e., the use of this framework must not make
      things worse.

   o  Taking above considerations into account, Section 8.2 specifies a
      small set of constraints for the FEC, which are mandatory for all
      senders compliant with this FEC Framework.  Further restrictions
      can be imposed by certain CDPs.

8.2.  Normative Requirements

   o  The bandwidth of FEC repair data MUST NOT exceed the bandwidth of
      the original source data being protected (without the possible
      addition of an Explicit Source FEC Payload ID).  This disallows
      the (static or dynamic) use of excessively strong FEC to combat
      high packet loss rates, which can otherwise be chosen by naively
      implemented dynamic FEC-strength selection mechanisms.  We
      acknowledge that there are a few exotic applications, e.g., IP
      traffic from space-based senders, or senders in certain hardened
      military devices, which could warrant a higher FEC strength.
      However, in this specification we give preference to the overall
      stability and network friendliness of average applications.

   o  Whenever the source data rate is adapted due to the operation of
      congestion control mechanisms, the FEC repair data rate MUST be
      similarly adapted.

9.  Security Considerations

   First of all, it must be clear that the application of FEC protection
   to a stream does not provide any kind of security.  On the opposite,
   the FEC Framework itself could be subject to attacks, or could pose
   new security risks.  The goals of this section are to state the
   problem, discuss the risks and identify solutions when feasible.  It
   also defines a mandatory to implement (but not mandatory to use)
   security scheme.

9.1.  Problem Statement

   A content delivery system is potentially subject to many attacks.
   Attacks can target the content, or the CDP, or the network itself,
   with completely different consequences, in particular in terms of the
   number of impacted nodes.

   Attacks can have several goals:

   o  They can try to give access to a confidential content (e.g., in
      case of a non-free content).

   o  They can try to corrupt the source flows (e.g., to prevent a
      receiver from using them), which is a form of DoS attack.

   o  They can try to compromise the receiver's behavior (e.g., by
      making the decoding of an object computationally expensive), which
      is another form of DoS attack.

   o  They can try to compromise the network's behavior (e.g., by
      causing congestion within the network), which potentially impacts
      a large number of nodes.

   These attacks can be launched either against the source and/or repair
   flows (e.g., by sending fake FEC source and/or repair packets) or
   against the FEC parameters that are sent either in-band (e.g., in the
   Repair FEC Payload ID or in the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID) or
   out-of-band (e.g., in the FEC Framework Configuration Information).

   Several dimensions to the problem need to be considered.  The first
   one is the way the FEC Framework is used.  The FEC Framework can be
   used end-to-end, i.e., it can be included in the final end-device
   where the upper application runs; or the FEC Framework can be used in
   middleboxes, for instance, to globally protect several source flows
   exchanged between two or more distant sites.

   A second dimension is the threat model.  When the FEC Framework
   operates in the end-device, this device (e.g., a personal computer)



Watson, et al.            Expires July 22, 2011                [Page 33]

Internet-Draft                FEC Framework                 January 2011


   might be subject to attacks.  Here, the attacker is either the end-
   user (who might want to access confidential content) or somebody
   else.  In all cases the attacker has access to the end-device, but
   not necessarily to the full control of the end-device (a secure
   domain can exist).  Similarly, when the FEC Framework operates in a
   middlebox, this middlebox can be subject to attacks or the attacker
   can gain access to it.  The threats can also concern the end-to-end
   transport (e.g., through Internet).  Here, examples of threats
   include the transmission of fake FEC source or repair packets, the
   replay of valid packets, the drop, delay or misordering of packets,
   and of course traffic eavesdropping.

   The third dimension consists in the desired security services.  Among
   them, the content integrity and sender authentication services are
   probably the most important features.  We can also mention DoS
   mitigation, anti-replay protection or content confidentiality.

   Finally, the fourth dimension consists in the security tools
   available.  This is the case of the various Digital Rights Management
   (DRM) systems, defined out of the context of the IETF and that can be
   proprietary solutions.  Otherwise SRTP and IPsec/ESP are two tools
   that can turn out to be useful in the context of the FEC Framework.
   Note that using SRTP requires that the application generates RTP
   source flows and, when applied below the FEC Framework, that both the
   FEC source and repair packets to be regular RTP packets.  Therefore
   SRTP is not considered as a universal solution applicable in all use
   cases.

   In the following sections, we further discuss security aspects
   related to the use of the FEC Framework.

9.2.  Attacks Against the Data Flows

9.2.1.  Access to Confidential Content

   Access control to the source flow being transmitted is typically
   provided by means of encryption.  This encryption can be done by the
   content provider itself, or within the application (for instance by
   using the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711]), or
   at the network layer, on a per-packet basis when IPsec/ESP is used
   [RFC4303].  If confidentiality is a concern, it is RECOMMENDED that
   one of these solutions is used.  Even if we mention these attacks
   here, they are neither related to nor facilitated by the use of FEC.

   Note that when encryption is applied, this encryption MUST either be
   applied on the source data before the FEC protection, or if done
   after the FEC protection, then both the FEC source packets and repair
   packets MUST be encrypted (and an encryption at least as



Watson, et al.            Expires July 22, 2011                [Page 34]

Internet-Draft                FEC Framework                 January 2011


   cryptographically secure as the encryption applied on the FEC source
   packets MUST be used for the FEC repair packets).  Otherwise, if
   encryption were to be performed only on the FEC source packets after
   FEC encoding, a non-authorized receiver could be able to recover the
   source data after decoding the FEC repair packets provided that a
   sufficient number of such packets were available.

   The following considerations apply when choosing where to apply
   encryption (and more generally where to apply security services
   beyond encryption).  Once decryption has taken place, the source data
   is in plaintext.  The full path between the output of the deciphering
   module and the final destination (e.g., the TV display in case of a
   video) MUST be secured, in order to prevent any unauthorized access
   to the source data.

   When the FEC Framework endpoint is the end system (i.e., where the
   upper application runs) and if the threat model includes the
   possibility that an attacker has access to this end system, then the
   end system architecture is very important.  More precisely, in order
   to prevent an attacker to get hold of the plaintext, all processings,
   once deciphering has taken place, MUST occur in a protected
   environment.  If encryption is applied after FEC protection at the
   sending side (i.e., below FEC Framework), it means that FEC decoding
   MUST take place in the protected environment.  With certain use
   cases, this MAY be complicated or even impossible.  In that case
   applying encryption before FEC protection is preferred.

   When the FEC Framework endpoint is a middlebox, the recovered source
   flow, after FEC decoding, SHOULD NOT be sent in plaintext to the
   final destination(s) if the threat model includes the possibility
   that an attacker eavesdrops the traffic.  In that case also it is
   preferred to apply encryption before FEC protection.

   In some cases, encryption could be applied both before and after the
   FEC protection.  The considerations described above still apply in
   such cases.

9.2.2.  Content Corruption

   Protection against corruptions (e.g., against forged FEC source/
   repair packets) is achieved by means of a content integrity
   verification/source authentication scheme.  This service is usually
   provided at the packet level.  In this case, after removing all the
   forged packets, the source flow might sometimes be recovered.
   Several techniques can provide this content integrity/source
   authentication service:

Internet-Draft                FEC Framework                 January 2011


   o  At the application layer, SRTP [RFC3711] provides several
      solutions to check the integrity and authenticate the source of
      RTP and RTCP messages, among other services.  For instance,
      associated to the Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant
      Authentication (TESLA) [RFC4383], SRTP is an attractive solution
      that is robust to losses, provides a true authentication/integrity
      service, and does not create any prohibitive processing load or
      transmission overhead.  Yet, checking a packet requires a small
      delay (a second or more) after its reception with TESLA.  Whether
      this extra delay, both in terms of startup delay at the client and
      end-to-end delay, is appropriate or not depends on the target use
      case.  In some situations, this might degrade the user experience.
      In other situations, this will not be an issue.  Other building
      blocks can be used within SRTP to provide content integrity/
      authentication services.

   o  At the network layer, IPsec/ESP [RFC4303] offers (among other
      services) an integrity verification mechanism that can be used to
      provide authentication/content integrity services.

   It is up to the developer and the person in charge of deployment, who
   know the security requirements and features of the target application
   area, to define which solution is the most appropriate.  Nonetheless
   it is RECOMMENDED that at least one of these techniques is used.

   Note that when integrity protection is applied, it is RECOMMENDED
   that it takes place on both FEC source and repair packets.  The
   motivation is to avoid corrupted packets to be considered during
   decoding, which would often lead to a decoding failure or result in a
   corrupted decoded source flow.

9.3.  Attacks Against the FEC Parameters

   Attacks on these FEC parameters can prevent the decoding of the
   associated object.  For instance, modifying the finite field size of
   a Reed-Solomon FEC scheme (when applicable) will lead a receiver to
   consider a different FEC code.

   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures are taken to
   guarantee the FEC Framework Configuration Information integrity.
   Since the FEC Framework does not define how the FEC Framework
   Configuration Information is communicated from sender to receiver, we
   cannot provide further recommendations on how to guarantee its
   integrity.  However, any complete CDP specification MUST give
   recommendations on how to achieve it.  When the FEC Framework
   Configuration Information is sent out-of-band, e.g., in a session
   description, it SHOULD be protected, for instance, by digitally
   signing it.

Internet-Draft                FEC Framework                 January 2011


   Attacks are also possible against some FEC parameters included in the
   Explicit Source FEC Payload ID and Repair FEC Payload ID.  For
   instance, modifying the Source Block Number of an FEC source or
   repair packet will lead a receiver to assign this packet to a wrong
   block.

   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures are taken to
   guarantee the Explicit Source FEC Payload ID and Repair FEC Payload
   ID integrity.  To that purpose, one of the packet-level source
   authentication/content integrity techniques of Section 9.2.2 can be
   used.

9.4.  When Several Source Flows are to be Protected Together

   When several source flows, with different security requirements, need
   to be FEC protected jointly, within a single FEC Framework instance,
   then each flow MAY be processed appropriately, before the protection.
   For instance, source Flows that require access control MAY be
   encrypted before they are FEC protected.

   There are also situations where the only insecure domain is the one
   over which the FEC Framework operates.  In that case, this situation
   MAY be addressed at the network layer, using IPsec/ESP (see
   Section 9.5), even if only a subset of the source flows have strict
   security requirements.

   Since the use of FEC Framework should not add any additional threat,
   it is RECOMMENDED that the FEC Framework aggregate flow be in line
   with the maximum security requirements of the individual source
   flows.  For instance, if denial-of-service (DoS) protection is
   required, an integrity protection SHOULD be provided below the FEC
   Framework, using for instance IPsec/ESP.

   Generally speaking, whenever feasible, it is RECOMMENDED to avoid FEC
   protecting flows with totally different security requirements.
   Otherwise, an important processing would be added to protect the
   source flows that do not need it.

9.5.  Baseline Secure FEC Framework Operation

   This section describes a baseline mode of secure FEC Framework
   operation based on the application of the IPsec security protocol,
   which is one possible solution to solve or mitigate the security
   threats introduced by the use of the FEC Framework.

   Two related documents are of interest.  First, Section 5.1 of
   [RFC5775] defines a baseline secure ALC operation for sender-to-group
   transmissions, assuming the presence of a single sender and a source-



Watson, et al.            Expires July 22, 2011                [Page 37]

Internet-Draft                FEC Framework                 January 2011


   specific multicast (SSM) or SSM-like operation.  The proposed
   solution, based on IPsec/ESP, can be used to provide a baseline FEC
   Framework secure operation, for the downstream source flow.

   Second, Section 7.1 of [RFC5740] defines a baseline secure NORM
   operation, for sender-to-group transmissions as well as unicast
   feedbacks from receivers.  Here, it is also assumed there is a single
   sender.  The proposed solution is also based on IPsec/ESP.  However,
   the difference with respect to the first document relies on the
   management of IPsec Security Associations (SA) and corresponding
   Security Policy Database (SPD) entries, since NORM requires a second
   set of SA and SPD to be defined to protect unicast feedbacks from
   receivers.

   The FEC Framework has been defined in such a way to be independent
   from the application that generates source flows.  Some applications
   might use purely unidirectional flows, while other applications might
   also use unicast feedbacks from the receivers.  For instance, this is
   the case when considering RTP/RTCP based source flows.  Depending on
   the specific situation, it is RECOMMENDED that the baseline secure
   FEC Framework operation inherits from [RFC5775] in case of purely
   unidirectional sender-to-group flows, or [RFC5740] in case both
   sender-to-group and unicast feedbacks flows are needed.

   Note that the IPsec/ESP requirements profiles outlined in [RFC5775]
   and [RFC5740] are commonly available on many potential hosts.  They
   can form the basis of a secure mode of operation.  One potential
   limitation, however, is the need for privileged user authorization.
   However, automated key management implementations are typically
   configured with the privileges necessary to affect system IPsec
   configuration.

10.  Operations and Management Considerations

   The FEC Framework is concerned about the FEC encoding and decoding
   operations, and the configuration information that is essential to
   control the hosts running these operations.  Defining tools for the
   operation and management of these hosts is not within the scope of
   this specification.

   Some applications using the CDPs compatible with the FEC Framework
   are one-way meaning that they do not have a way to gather any kind of
   feedback from receivers (e.g., broadcast), while some of them may
   collect detailed feedback (in case it is a one-to-one application) or
   occasional feedback (in case it is a multicast (one-to-many)
   application).  All these applications have naturally different
   management aspects.  If any, they also have different requirements or
   features for collecting feedback, processing it and acting on it.
   The data structures for carrying the feedback also vary.

   From an operational viewpoint, it is important to note that in one-
   to-many applications, there could be some receivers that are not
   capable of decoding the repair packets belonging to a particular FEC
   scheme, or some receivers could be non-FEC-capable at all.  Such
   receivers can opt not to receive the repair packets that they will
   not be able to decode in the first place or discard them
   appropriately upon receiving them.  However, if the source packets
   have been modified during FEC encoding according to the rules
   specified in Section 5.3, the receivers that are not FEC Framework
   compatible will not even be able to use the source packets.  When
   using FEC Framework in such receiver populations, it is important to
   keep the source packets unmodified or offer the unmodified source
   packets through another distribution channel to non-compatible
   receivers.  For details, see Section 5.3.

   It is not advisable for the FEC Framework to explicitly list what the
   hosts (sender or receiver or even a middle-box) could do upon
   observing something in particular or receiving a specific feedback.
   The CDPs and the FEC schemes compatible with the FEC Framework SHOULD
   make use of existing tools as much as possible and to the extent
   possible.  For example, for repair flows using RTP transport,
   benefiting from all the features of RTCP mechanisms is strongly
   RECOMMENDED since RTCP has already solved many of these issues in an
   agnostic way of the data carried with RTP.

   Overall, the CDPs and FEC schemes compatible with the FEC Framework
   widely differ in their capabilities, application and deployment
   scenarios such that a common operation and management tool that works
   well for all of them does not exist.  Thus, as a design choice, the
   FEC Framework does not dictate the use of any particular technology

   or protocol for transporting FEC data, managing the hosts, signaling
   the configuration information or encoding the configuration
   information.  This provides flexibility and was one of the main goals
   of the FEC Framework.

11.  IANA Considerations

   FEC schemes for use with this framework are identified in protocols
   using FEC Encoding IDs.  Values of FEC Encoding IDs are subject to
   IANA registration.  For this purposes, this document creates a new
   registry called FEC Framework (FECFRAME) FEC Encoding IDs.

   The values that can be assigned within the FEC Framework (FECFRAME)
   FEC Encoding ID registry are numeric indexes in the range (0, 255).
   Values of 0 and 255 are reserved.  Assignment requests are granted on
   an IETF Consensus basis as defined in [RFC5226].  Section 5.6 defines
   explicit requirements that documents defining new FEC Encoding IDs
   should meet.
