      <t>Many Web servers supply incorrect Content-Type headers with their
      HTTP responses.  In order to be compatible with these Web servers, Web
      browsers must consider the content of HTTP responses as well as the
      Content-Type header when determining the effective mime type of the
      response.  This document describes an algorithm for determining the
      effective mime type of HTTP responses that balances security and
      compatibility considerations.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The HTTP Content-Type header indicates the mime type of an HTTP
      responses.  However, many HTTP servers supply a Content-Type that does
      not match the actual contents of the response.  Historically, Web
      browsers have been tolerated these servers by examining the content of
      HTTP responses in addition to the Content-Type header to determine the
      effective mime type of the response.</t>

      <t>Without a clear specification of how to "sniff" the mime type, each
      browser vendor was forced to reverse engineer the behavior of the
      other borwsers and to developed their own algorithm.  These divergent
      algorithms have lead to a lack of interoperability between browsers
      and to security issues when the site intends an HTTP response to be
      interpreted as one mime type but the browser interpretes the responses
      as another mime type.</t>
      
      <t>These security issues are must severe when a Web site lets users
      upload files and then serves the contents of those files with a
      low-privilege mime type (such as text/plain or image/jpeg).  In the
      absense of mime sniffing, this user-generated content will not be able
      to run JavaScript, but if the browser treats the response as
      text/html, then the user can mount a cross-site scripting attack by
      including JavaScript code in the uploaded file.</t>
      
      <t>This document describes a mime sniffing algorithm that carefully
      balances the compatibility needs of browser vendors with the security
      constraints.  The algorithm has been constructed with reference to
      mime sniffing algorithms present in popular Web browsers, an extensive
      database of Web content, and metrics collected from implementations
      deployed to a sizable number of Web users.</t>

      <t>Warning!  It is imperative that the algorithm in this document be
      followed exactly.  When a user agent uses different heuristics for
      content type detection than the server expects, security problems can
      occur. For example, if a server believes that the client will treat a
      contributed file as an image (and thus treat it as benign), but a Web
      browser believes the content to be HTML (and thus execute any scripts
      contained therein), the end user can be exposed to malicious content,
      making the user vulnerable to cookie theft attacks and other
      cross-site scripting attacks.</t>

      <t>What explicit Content-Type metadata is associated with the resource
      (the resource's type information) depends on the protocol that was
      used to fetch the resource.</t>

      <t>For HTTP resources, only the first Content-Type HTTP header, if
      any, contributes any type information; the explicit type of the
      resource is then the value of that header, interpreted as described by
      the HTTP specifications. If the Content-Type HTTP header is present
      but the value of the first such header cannot be interpreted as
      described by the HTTP specifications (e.g. because its value doesn't
      contain a U+002F SOLIDUS ('/') character), then the resource has no
      type information (even if there are multiple Content-Type HTTP headers
      and one of the other ones is syntactically correct). [HTTP]</t>

      <t>For resources fetched from the file system, user agents should use
      platform-specific conventions, e.g. operating system extension/type
      mappings.</t>

      <t>Extensions must not be used for determining resource types for
      resources fetched over HTTP.</t>

      <t>For resources fetched over most other protocols, e.g. FTP, there is
      no type information.</t>

      <t>The algorithm for extracting an encoding from a Content-Type, given
      a string s, is as follows. It either returns an encoding or nothing.
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>Find the first seven characters in s that are an ASCII
        case-insensitive match for the word "charset". If no such match is
        found, return nothing.</t>

        <t>Skip any U+0009, U+000A, U+000C, U+000D, or U+0020 characters
        that immediately follow the word 'charset' (there might not be
        any).</t>

        <t>If the next character is not a U+003D EQUALS SIGN ('='), return
        nothing.</t>

        <t>Skip any U+0009, U+000A, U+000C, U+000D, or U+0020 characters
        that immediately follow the equals sign (there might not be
        any).</t>

        <t>Process the next character as follows:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>If it is a U+0022 QUOTATION MARK ('"') and there is a later
          U+0022 QUOTATION MARK ('"') in s, or</t>
          <t>If it is a U+0027 APOSTROPHE ("'") and there is a later U+0027
          APOSTROPHE ("'") in s
          <list style="empty">
            <t>Return the string between this character and the next
            earliest occurrence of this character.</t>
          </list>
          </t>

          <t>If it is an unmatched U+0022 QUOTATION MARK ('"'),</t>
          <t>If it is an unmatched U+0027 APOSTROPHE ("'"), or</t>
          <t>If there is no next character
          <list style="empty">
            <t>Return nothing.</t>
          </list>
          </t>

          <t>Otherwise
          <list style="empty">
            <t>Return the string from this character to the first U+0009,
            U+000A, U+000C, U+000D, U+0020, or U+003B character or the end
            of s, whichever comes first.</t>

          above table.

      <t>User agents may support further types if desired, by implicitly
      adding to the above table. However, user agents should not use any
      other patterns for types already mentioned in the table above, as this
      could then be used for privilege escalation (where, e.g., a server
      uses the above table to determine that content is not HTML and thus
      safe from XSS attacks, but then a user agent detects it as HTML anyway
      and allows script to execute).</t>

      <t>The column marked "security" is used by the algorithm in the "text
      or binary" section, to avoid sniffing text/plain content as a type
      that can be used for a privilege escalation attack.</t>

        <t>???? If, before the next "&gt;", you find two xmlns* attributes
        with http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# and
        http://purl.org/rss/1.0/ as the namespaces, then the sniffed type of
        the resource is "application/rss+xml", abort these steps. (maybe we
        only need to check for http://purl.org/rss/1.0/ actually) ????</t>

        <t>Otherwise, the sniffed type of the resource is "text/html".</t>
