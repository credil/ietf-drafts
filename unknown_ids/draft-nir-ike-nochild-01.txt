Abstract

   This document describes an extension to the IKEv2 protocol that
   allows an IKE SA to be created and authenticated without generating a
   child SA.

Internet-Draft              IKE WITHOUT CHILD                   May 2009


1.  Introduction

   IKEv2, as specified in [RFC4306] requires that in an IKE_AUTH
   exchange, a child SA is created along with the IKE SA.  This
   requirement is sometimes inconvenient, as some implementations need
   to use IKE for authentication only, while other implementations would
   like to set up the IKE SA before there is any actual traffic to
   protect.

   An IKE SA without any child SA is not a fruitless endeavor.  Even
   without Child SAs, an IKE SA allows:
   o  Checking the liveness status of the peer via liveness checks.
   o  Quickly setting up child SAs without public key operations, and/or
      without user interaction.
   o  Authentication of the peer.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Usage Scenarios

   Several scenarios motivated this proposal:
   o  Interactive remote access VPN: the user tells the client to
      "connect", which may involve interactive authentication.  There is
      still no traffic, but some may come later.  Since there is no
      traffic, it is impossible for the gateway to know what selectors
      to use (how to narrow down the client's proposal).
   o  Location aware security, as in [SecureBeacon].  The user is
      roaming between trusted and untrusted networks.  While in an
      untrusted network, all traffic should be encrypted, but on the
      trusted network, only the IKE SA needs to be maintained.
   o  A future extension may have IKE SAs used for generating keying
      material for applications, without ever requiring child SAs.  This
      is similar to what [extractors] is doing in TLS.

   In some of these cases it may be possible to create a dummy Child SA
   and then remove it, but this creates undesirable side effects and
   race conditions.  Moreover, the IKE peer might see the deletion of
   the Child SA as a reason to delete the IKE SA.


3.  Protocol Outline

   The decision of whether or not to support an IKE_AUTH exchage without

   the piggy-backed child SA negotiation is ultimately up to the
   reponsder.  A supporting resonder MUST include the VID payload,
   described in Section 4, within the IKE_INIT response.

   A supporting initiator MAY send the modified IKE_AUTH request,
   described in Section 5, if the VID payload was included in the
   IKE_INIT response.  The initiator MUST NOT send the modified IKE_AUTH
   request if the VID was not present.

   A supporting responder that advertised the VID payload in the
   IKE_INIT response MUST process a modified IKE_AUTH request, and MUST
   reply with a modified IKE_AUTH response.  Such a responder MUST NOT
   reply with a modified IKE_AUTH response if the initiator did not send
   a modified IKE_AUTH request.

   A supporting responder that has been configured not to support this
   extension to the protocol MUST behave as the same as if it didn't
   support this extension.  It MUST NOT advertise the capability with a
   VID payload, and it SHOULD reply with an INVALID_SYNTAX Notify
   payload if the client sends an IKE_AUTH request that is modified as
   described in Section 5.


4.  VID Payload

   The VID payload is as described in [RFC4306] with the data as
   follows:

             73da4b423dd9f75563b15b9f918650fc

   This value was obtained by hashing the string "Will do IKE_AUTH
   without child SA payloads"


5.  Modified IKE_AUTH Exchange

   For brevity, only the EAP version of an AUTH exchange will be
   presented here.  The non-EAP version is very similar.  The figures
   below are based on appendix A.3 of [RFC4718].

                            [V+]

   Note what is missing:
   o  The optional notifications: IPCOMP_SUPPORTED, USE_TRANSPORT_MODE,
      ESP_TFC_PADDING_NOT_SUPPORTED, and NON_FIRST_FRAGMENTS_ALSO.
   o  The SA payload.
   o  The traffic selector payloads.
   o  Any notification, extension payload or VendorID that has to do
      with child SA negotiation.
