Abstract

   The Internet is in the early stages of what may be a protracted
   period of coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6.  Network operators are
   challenged with the task of activating IPv6 without negative impact
   on operating IPv4 networks and their customers.  This draft is an
   informational "annotated bibliography" compiled to help in the
   analysis and development of basic guidelines and recommendations for
   network operators.  The goal of this document is to survey the
   current state of RFCs, Internet-Drafts and external reference
   materials that define the use cases, problem statements, protocols,
   transition mechanisms and coexistence tools that will be of interest
   to a network operator planning to turn on IPv6.

1. Introduction

   Since the IPv6 protocol was defined in 1995 as RFC 1883 (replaced in
   1998 by RFC 2460) the Internet has been in a long transition from
   IPv4 to IPv6.  In reality, we are still in the early stages of what
   is likely to be a protracted period of coexistence, where IPv6
   penetration in hosts (both servers and clients) will gradually ramp
   up as networks make IPv6 available through their infrastructures.

   Network operators face a daunting task to design and implement plans
   to activate IPv6 without negative impact on large (in some cases very
   large) operating IPv4 networks with many live customers.  Some basic
   guidelines and recommendations for network operators are being
   developed (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lee-v4v6tran-problem) and
   this draft is an informational companion to that effort.  The goal of
   this document is to survey the current state of RFCs, active (and
   expired but still relevant) Internet-Drafts and external reference
   materials that define the use cases, problem statements, protocols,
   transition mechanisms and coexistence tools that will be of interest
   to a network operator planning to turn on IPv6.

   This is a dynamic and evolving marketplace of ideas.  At best, this
   draft is a blurry snapshot of the landscape near to the time of its
   publication.  The editor intends this compendium to be merely the
   starting point for an active database or wiki available for community
   contribution including feedback on the real-world experience of
   network operators as they turn on IPv6.

   The following sections comprise an annotated bibliography of the
   currently available documentation to knowledge of the editor.  It is
   provided as informational guidance only, and any network operator
   contemplating an IPv6 implementation will of course exercise due
   diligence in researching all the issues, standards and
   recommendations and analyze applicability to the particular network
   operation.

   Note that as the body of this text includes full reference
   information for the bibliography entries these are not included in
   the normal Reference section.

   This draft is being developed by an ad-hoc group interested in
   providing guidance to network operators on the IPv6 transition.  It
   will include high level use cases (as contributed by IETF
   participants with network operator experience) and a problem

   Mobile Internet access from smartphones and other mobile devices is
   accelerating the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.  IPv6 is widely seen
   as crucial for the continued operation and growth of the Internet,
   and in particular, it is critical in mobile networks.  This document
   discusses the issues that arise when deploying IPv6 in mobile
   networks.  Hence, this document can be a useful reference for service
   providers and network designers.

   This draft makes several recommendations to ensure user satisfaction
   and a smooth transition from HTTP's pervasive IPv4 to IPv6 and from
   TCP to SCTP.  While the target audience is app developers and content
   providers, network operators should be aware of techniques needed to
   maintain peaceful coexistence without negative impact on end-user
   perception of service level.

   "Migrating SIP to IPv6 Media Without Connectivity Checks" D. Wing, A.
   Yourtchenko
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wing-dispatch-v6-migration

   During the migration from IPv4 to IPv6, it is anticipated that an
   IPv6 path might be broken for a variety of reasons, causing endpoints
   to not receive RTP data.  Connectivity checks would detect and avoid
   the user noticing such a problem, but there is industry reluctance to
   implement connectivity checks.

   This document describes a mechanism allowing dual-stack SIP endpoints
   to attempt communications over IPv6 and fall back to IPv4 if the IPv6
   path is not working.  The mechanism does not require connectivity
   checks.

   "IPv6 Deployment in Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)", Roque Gagliano
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-v6ops-v6inixp

   This draft suggests that in an Internet Exchange Point one might use
   an address that helps in debugging routing exchanges.  One could also
   look at what other folks do, embedding identifying marks in
   addresses.  For example, Facebook includes "face:b00c" in the IID
   portion of their address.

6. Transition/Coexistence Tools

   As network operators and end-users independently proceed with
   transition to IPv6 while others continue to use IPv4, a potentially
   long period of coexistence will ensue.  Variations on terminology
   have been used since the specification of IPv6; transition implies a
   process whereby the star of IPv6 rises and the star of IPv4 sets;
   coexistence implies that both will operate together.  Due to
   thoroughly discussed limits to the growth of an Internet using only
   IPv4, IPv6 is a necessary technology for the future of the Internet.
   However, nothing compels the elimination of IPv4; no protocol police
   will forbid its use in the foreseeable future.  IPv4 may disappear
   due to irrelevance when IPv6 is so pervasive to make it redundant,
   but network operators should be prepared to operate IPv4 and IPv6 in
   a mixed deployment for some time.  However, the techniques and
   mechanisms supported by a network operator can be expected to evolve

   and change over time as a rational goal would be to gradually shift
   coexistence costs (real operational expense as well as convenience)
   from "early adopters" of IPv6 to the shrinking pool of IPv4
   maintainers.

   Various techniques are required for coexistence, roughly divided into
   three categories:

   1. Address Mapping:  Many situations will require the use of address
       mapping to maintain scalability in the face of dwindling IPv4
       global address space and to support translation and tunneling
       approaches.

   2. Tunneling:  A method for the encapsulation and transport of one
       protocol over or through the infrastructure that favors the
       other, e.g. IPv6 traffic via an IPv4 infrastructure

   3. Translation:  A mechanism for rewriting packets from one protocol
       to the other so they can be delivered as native (non-
       encapsulated) packets typically due to incompatible end nodes,
       e.g. an IPv6 client to an IPv4 server.

   These categories are not mutually exclusive, as some scenarios and
   solutions incorporate aspects of multiple approaches.

   disparate address domains may be needed for provision of services
   such as SIP during transition.

   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-boucadair-behave-ipv6-portrange-04

   This memo presents a solution to solve IPv4 address shortage and ease
   IPv4-IPv6 interconnection.  The document presents a set of
   incremental steps for the deployment of IPv6 as a means to solve IPv4
   address exhaustion.  Stateless IPv4/IPv6 address mapping functions
   are introduced and IPv4-IPv6 interconnection scenarios presented.

   This memo advocates for a more proactive approach for the deployment
   of IPv6 into operational networks.  This memo specifies the IPv6
   variant of the A+P. Both encapsulation and translation scheme are
   covered.  Moreover, two modes are elaborated: the binding mode
   (compatible mode with DS-lite) and the stateless mode.

   Gateway-Initiated Dual-Stack lite (GI-DS-lite) is a modified approach
   to the original Dual-Stack lite (DS-lite) applicable to certain
   tunnel-based access architectures.  GI-DS-lite extends existing
   access tunnels beyond the access gateway to an IPv4-IPv4 NAT using
   softwires with an embedded context identifier, that uniquely
   identifies the end-system the tunneled packets belong to.  The access
   gateway determines which portion of the traffic requires NAT using
   local policies and sends/receives this portion to/from this softwire
   tunnel.

   logically extend existing access tunnels beyond the access gateway to
   DS-Lite Address Family Transition Router element (AFTR) using
   softwires with an embedded context identifier.  This memo describes a
   deployment model using GI-DS-lite in Point-to-Point access network.

   Dual-Stack lite requires that the AFTR must have IPv4 connectivity.
   This forbids a service provider who wants to deploy AFTR in an IPv6-
   only network.  This memo proposes an extension to implement a
   stateless IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation in the AFTR so that AFTR can be
   deployed in an IPv6-only network.

   TSP is an Experimental RFC defining a method for a tunnel client to
   negotiate tunnel characteristics with a tunnel broker.  It enables
   tunnels in various deployment architectures including NAT traversal
   and mobility, and for user authentication it utilizes:

6.2.4. Residual IPv4 Deployment over IPv6-only Infrastructure

   Further down the transition road, operators may desire to retire IPv4
   routing support and move their backbone networks to IPv6-only.  There
   may be residual IPv4 legacy customers (clients and servers) still
   requiring the delivery of IPv4 packets.  While the previously
   proposed Dual-Stack Transition Mechanism (DSTM) approach attempted to
   satisfy this use case, it was complex and stateful.  A stateless
   approach to IPv4 residual deployment (4rd) is defined in section 3.2
   of the Stateless Address Mapping (SAM) draft.  At the time of this
   publication, several network operators in Japan are planning
   implementation to support residual IPv4 customers.

   This draft discusses the possibility of address sharing by treating
   some of the port number bits as part of an extended IPv4 address
   (Address plus Port, or A+P).  Instead of assigning a single IPv4
   address to a customer device, we propose to extended the address by
   "stealing" bits from the port number in the TCP/UDP header, leaving
   the applications a reduced range of ports.  This means assigning the
   same IPv4 address to multiple clients (e.g., CPE, mobile phones),
   each with its assigned port-range.  In the face of IPv4 address
   exhaustion, the need for addresses is stronger than the need to be
   able to address thousands of applications on a single host.  If
   address translation is needed, the end-user should be in control of
   the translation process - not some smart boxes in the core.

   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-xiaoyu-aplusp-lite

   This document proposes a solution aimed at providing IPv4 continuity
   in IPv6 environment. The proposed solution is expected to alleviate
   the public IPv4 depletion problem while maximize the benefits from
   IPv6 deployment, and meet the desired service availability and
   reliability with affordable cost.

6.2.5.1. IRON-RANGER and ISATAP Solutions

   A body of RFCs and drafts in progress provide an alternative approach
   to IPv4/IPv6 coexistence.  This approach utilizes tunneling
   techniques to create "overlay" networks.  While currently considered
   "Experimental" it may be of interest to network operators as an
   alternative network architecture.

6.3. Translation

   From the earliest specification of IPv6 IETF contributors have
   recognized that translation would be a necessary tool for transition
   and coexistence, as IPv6 was designed as an incompatible replacement
   rather than an extension of IPv4.  The original approach to stateless
   translation defined in RFC 2765 and its implementation as NA(P)T-PT
   as described in RFC 2766 had a number of issues that resulting in the
   approach being deprecated by RFC 4966.  Recently the Behave WG has
   taken on the work of defining a set of scenarios covering the use
   cases for translation, prioritizing the work and defining new
   solutions that overcome the deficiencies of the historic approach.

6.3.1. Historic Approach

   RFC 2765 "Stateless IP/ICMP Translation (SIIT)." E. Nordmark,
   February 2000 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2765

   PT)." G. Tsirtsis and P. Srisresh, February 2000

   al. October 2002
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3338

   These two RFCs are proposed for obsolescence by a draft that combines
   both:

   and T. Savolainen

6.3.2. Current Translation Approaches

   A renewed effort to define new translation mechanisms started with
   discussions in the Internet Area (intarea) meeting and the Technical
   Plenary at IETF 71 in Dublin, and continued at a special meeting in

   Montreal in October 2008.  This led to a commitment by contributors
   in the Behave WG to take on the work.  A set of scenarios were
   defined along with a framework for the translation solutions.

   "A Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation" F. Baker et al.
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-behave-v6v4-framework

   This draft (Framework) is the place to start to understand the
   historic context for translation, the definition and rationale for
   the set of translation scenarios and canonical definitions for some
   of the terminology that arises when talking about translation and
   coexistence in general.

   The 4 deployment modes for these scenarios are:

   1. Connecting between the IPv4 Internet and the IPv6 Internet

   2. Connecting an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet

   3. Connecting an IPv4 network to the IPv6 Internet

   4. Connecting between an IPv4 network and an IPv6 network

   As solutions may differ with respect to the initiating end of the
   conversation, 8 scenarios are defined in the Framework draft, as
   recapped in the following sections along with specifications that fit
   each scenario.

   Some general specifications that are cited in the various solution
   specifications (or may be in subsequent revisions) are:

   "IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators" C. Bao et al. August 16,
   2010 http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-behave-address-format-10

   "DNS64: DNS extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6
   Clients to IPv4 Servers" M. Bagnulo et al.  July 5, 2010

   "Analysis of 64 Translation" R. Penno, T. Saxena and D. Wing
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-penno-behave-64-analysis

   Due to specific problems, NAT-PT was deprecated by the IETF as a
   mechanism to perform IPv6-IPv4 translation.  Since then, new effort
   has been undertaken within IETF to standardize alternative mechanisms
   to perform IPv6-IPv4 translation.  This document evaluates how the
   new translation mechanisms avoid the problems that caused the IETF to
   deprecate NAT-PT.

6.3.2.1. An IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet

   The Framework defines Scenario 1 for an early adopter (end user or
   network operator) which establishes an IPv6 network and needs to
   maintain access to the global IPv4 Internet, preferably without
   assigning IPv4 addresses to the nodes of the IPv6 network.  Either
   the Stateful or Stateless solutions proposed may satisfy this
   deployment scenario.

   Clients to IPv4 Servers" M. Bagnulo, P. Matthews and I. van Beijnum

   "IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm" X. Li, C. Bao and F. Baker
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate

6.3.2.2. The IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network

   The Framework defines Scenario 2 for a node on the IPv4 Internet
   initiating a transmission to a node on an IPv6 network.  The original
   approach to this deployment was SIIT (in RFC 2765) which has been
   deprecated (by RFC 4966).  The Stateless Translation solution for
   Scenario 1 also would work for this case as it does support IPv4-
   initiated communication with a subset of IPv6 addresses.

6.3.2.3. The IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 network

   The Framework defines Scenario 3 where a legacy IPv4 network has a
   requirement to provide services to users in the IPv6 Internet.
   Stateful Translation with static AAAA records in DNS to represent the
   IPv4-only hosts will work.

   "Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6
   Clients to IPv4 Servers" M. Bagnulo, P. Matthews and I. van Beijnum

   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-behave-dns64

   Alternatively, host-based translation (BIH) or tightly-coupled
   translators may be considered.

6.3.2.4. An IPv4 network to the IPv6 Internet

   Scenario 4 is not easy to solve but fortunately will not arise until
   significant IPv6 uptake.  In-network translation is not viable, and
   other techniques should be considered including host-based
   translation (BIH) or tightly-coupled translators that adapt legacy
   hosts or networks to the IPv6 Internet.

6.3.2.5. An IPv6 network to an IPv4 network

   Scenario 5 describes a configuration where both the IPv6 network and
   IPv4 network are within the administrative control of the same
   organization.  It appears amenable to the same solutions proposed for
   Scenario 1.

6.3.2.6. An IPv4 network to an IPv6 network

   Scenario 6 is the mirror image of Scenario 5, with communication
   initiated from the IPv4 side.  It appears amenable to the same
   solution proposed for Scenario 2.

6.3.2.7. The IPv6 Internet to the IPv4 Internet

   The Framework indicates that Scenario 7, the interconnection of the
   IPv4 Internet with the IPv6 Internet may appear to be an ideal case
   for an in-network translator (such as the deprecated NAT-PT), but
   there is no viable way to map the immense IPv6 address space onto
   IPv4.  This situation would not entail until significant IPv6
   adoption, and has not been a priority for solution.

6.3.2.8. The IPv4 Internet to the IPv6 Internet

   Scenario 8 presents a challenge similar to Scenario 7.

   the process and to perhaps save a few hours of redundant effort for
   someone to find this information.  Of course, this will be out of
   date before it is published as active research continues in
   coexistence and transition tools.  The editor hopes it is at least a
   useful "You Are Here" map to help navigate the thrill rides available
   in the IPv6 theme park.

   This compendium could serve as an initial set of data to populate an
   active database or wiki.  This would allow continuing community
   contribution including feedback on the real-world experience of
   network operators as they turn on IPv6.
