Internet-Draft    SMTP Enhanced Status Codes for Anti-Spam    March 2010


Abstract

   This document establishes a set of extended SMTP policy codes for
   anti-spam. It seeks to provide additional codes for error texts that
   currently use the extended SMTP error code 5.7.1. The anti-spam codes
   were determined by looking at error texts produced by major ISPs and
   finding commonalities. The result is a new set of error texts with
   associated extended SMTP error codes.

Internet-Draft    SMTP Enhanced Status Codes for Anti-Spam    March 2010


1.  Introduction

   This RFC defines a set of Enhanced Status Codes [RFC3463] [RFC1893]
   for SMTP related to anti-spam policy.  These codes are to be
   registered with the IANA Mail Enhanced Status Codes registry as
   defined in [RFC5248].  Anti-Spam policy is inherently a local
   decision.  This document strives to document the more common policies
   and define an initial set of enhanced status codes.  While this
   document provides suggested text for each detail code, alternate text
   can be provided if the text is in the spirit of the suggested text.
   This will allow sites to simply prepend the proper extended SMTP code
   to their existing text.  Sites that are starting to implement
   anti-spam policy SHOULD use the text provided in this document.

   All of these messages were gathered by surveying several existing
   large ISPs to see what messages they produce when presented with
   messages that violate their policies. An attempt was then made to
   coalesce the messages together into common themes.

   This document is being discussed on the SMTP mailing list,
   ietf-smtp@imc.org [1].

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is directed to add the following values to the registry of Mail
   Enhanced Status Codes specified in [RFC5248].

   The Mail Enhanced Status Codes registry will be modified to add a new
   subject sub-code having the value 8.  This sub-code will be dedicated
   to anti-spam policy related SMTP errors.

   All following entries will use the following common fields:

    Reference:		<<THIS RFC>>
    Submitter:		J. Macdonald
    Change Controller:	IESG


   The following Subject Sub-code is defined:

    Code:		X.8.YYY
    Summary:		Anti-Spam policy related
    Description:	All status codes related to anti-spam policy
    			that are not security related, as decided by a
    			site administrator.


   The following enumerated status codes are defined.

    Code:		X.8.0
    Sample Text:	Undefined Policy detail
    Associated Basic Status Code: ????
    Description:	This enhanced status code SHOULD be returned
    			when no other applicable anti-spam policy
    			enhanced status code is appropriate.
    			Administrators are encouraged to contact the
    			Author stating how other detail codes fail to
    			satisfy their criteria in order to facilitate
    			an update to this RFC.  Administrators SHOULD
    			indicate what policy is being violated by
    			including a URL providing further details by
    			appending the text with
    			": see <URL> for further details." X.8.0 should
    			be used for all errors for which there is no
    			detail error known.

    Code:		X.8.1
    Sample Text:	message refused by local policy
    Associated Basic Status Code: ????
    Description:	This indicates that the something in the message
    			has violated some local policy but the site
    			administrator is not willing to divulge any
    			further details as to what policy has been
    			violated.

    			recipients has passed the receiving sites
    			threshold.  Administrators MAY include a URL for
			further details by appending the text with
			": see <URL> for further details."

3.  Security Considerations

   As stated in [RFC1893], use of enhanced status codes may disclose
   additional information about how an internal mail system is
   implemented beyond that available through the SMTP status codes.

   Some of the proposed additions to the response code list are security
   related.  Having these registered in one place to prevent collisions
   will improve their value.  Security error responses can leak
   information to active attackers (e.g., the distinction between "user
   not found" and "bad password" during authentication).  Documents
   defining security error codes should make it clear when this is the
   case, so that SMTP server software subject to such threats can
   provide appropriate controls to restrict exposure.
