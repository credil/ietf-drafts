Abstract

   To withhold a user's identity and related information, RFC 3323
   defines a Privacy mechanism for SIP, which requires the use of an
   privacy service.  This document proposes a new privacy mechanism that
   a user agent can facilitate to conceal privacy-sensitive information
   without the need for aid from a privacy service.

Internet-Draft     UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP     February 2007


1.  Introduction

   Privacy is defined in [RFC3323] as the withholding of the identity of
   a person (and related personal information) from destination(s) of
   messages and/or intermediaries handling these messages in an exchange
   of SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) [RFC3261] communications.

   In SIP, identity is most commonly carried in the form of a SIP URI
   and an optional display-name, which commonly appear in the To, From
   and other header fields of SIP requests and responses.

   There are numerous other places in SIP messages in which identity-
   related information can be revealed.  For example, the Contact header
   field contains a SIP URI.  Moreover, information in the Record-Route
   and Via headers could inadvertently reveal something about the
   originator of a message.

   RFC 3323 defines privacy mechanisms for SIP, based on techniques
   available at the time of publication.  Some of these mechanisms rely
   on the use of a separate privacy service to remove sensitive
   information from messages sent by a user agent before forwarding
   those messages to the final destination.  Since then, numerous SIP
   extensions have been proposed and standardized.  Some of those seem
   to enable a user agent to withhold its user's identity and related
   information without dependency on privacy services, which was not
   possible when RFC 3323 was defined.

   A number of issues have been identified with the mechanisms defined
   in RFC 3323, especially with mechanisms that depend on a privacy
   service.

   1.  There is no assurance that a privacy service exists in the
       signaling path.

   2.  There is no way that the user requesting the privacy can figure
       out that the privacy function was properly executed.

   3.  A privacy service that modifies a Call-ID must be present in the
       signaling path of any subsequent requests that carry that
       Call-ID.  For requests within the same dialog this can be
       achieved using the record-route mechanism.  For requests outside
       the dialog that carry the Call-ID in a Replaces, Join or Target-
       Dialog header field, for example, there is no defined mechanism.

   4.  To map the referenced dialog to a dialog attempt invoked by
       REFER, for example, the privacy service needs to retain the
       correspondence relation between original information and modified
       information beyond the actual dialog duration of the referenced

       dialog.

   To solve the problems, this document proposes a new privacy mechanism
   in which a user agent controls all the privacy functions on its own
   utilizing SIP extensions such as GRUU (Globally Routable User Agent
   URIs)[I-D.ietf-sip-gruu] and TURN (Traversal Using Relay
   NAT)[I-D.ietf-behave-turn].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   privacy-sensitive information:
               The information that identifies a user who sends the SIP
               message, as well as the supplementary information that
               can be used to guess the user's identity.


3.  Concept of Privacy

   The concept of privacy in this document means the concealing of the
   identity of a user and supplementary information.  The scope of this
   document is to withhold the privacy-sensitive information of the user
   who sends the SIP message from other users and intermediaries
   handling the message.  The protection of network privacy (e.g.,
   topology hiding) is outside the scope of this document.

   Privacy-sensitive information includes display-name and URI in a From
   header that can reveal the user's name and affiliation (e.g., company
   name), contact information in a Contact header that is used to
   communicate with the user's UA, an IP address in an SDP (Session
   Description Protocol)[RFC4566] that tells the location of a user's UA
   and can be used to establish a connection.  A host name in Call-ID is
   also regarded as privacy-sensitive information because it may reveal
   the user's domain name.

   Privacy-sensitive information is divided into two types, information
   inserted by the user's UA and information inserted by other SIP
   entities (e.g., proxies, B2BUAs).  A user agent can maintain privacy
   of the UA-inserted information by itself.  On the other hand,
   regarding the information inserted by other entities, a user agent
   can insert a privacy flag and request intermediaries not to add the
   privacy-sensitve information.

Internet-Draft     UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP     February 2007


4.  Requirements

   The requirements for the UA-driven privacy mechanism are as follows:

   Req 1:  A user agent MUST be able to send a SIP request that is fully
           anonymized.  This is, any headers and body inserted by the
           user agent does not jeopardize user privacy.

   Req 2:  It MUST be possible for a user agent to indicate to
           downstream entities that a user is requesting privacy.

   Req 3:  When privacy is requested, a proxy SHOULD honor the request
           and only add information necessary to route the call while
           withholding any sensitive information that may reveal
           anything about the user if possible.

   Req 4:  Mechanism defined here MUST be backward compatible with the
           pre-existing privacy mechanism already in place.


5.  Treatment of Privacy-Sensitive Information

   Except by means of a privacy service, RFC 3323 does not provide means
   to obscure two important pieces of information about the user agent,
   which are a URI used to exchange signaling (Contact, From, for
   example), and IP address(es) used to exchange media.

   RFC 3323 recommends to set sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid as a SIP
   URI in a From header when user privacy is required.  Although, the
   From header field URI may need to be an anonymous but functional URI.
   For example, a mechanism of SIP-Identity [RFC4474] requires a
   functional From header even if it is anonymous.

   With the use of GRUU [I-D.ietf-sip-gruu] and TURN
   [I-D.ietf-behave-turn], a user agent can now obtain URI(s) and IP
   address(es) for media that are functional yet anonymous, in that they
   do not identify the user agent.

5.1.  Anonymous URI and Display-Name

   A user agent wanting to obtain functional anonymous URI SHOULD
   support and SHOULD utilize the GRUU mechanism.  By sending a REGISTER
   request requesting GRUU, the UA can obtain an anonymous URI, which
   can later be used for Contact header.

   The detailed process on how a user agent obtains a GRUU is described
   in [I-D.ietf-sip-gruu].  If the Registrar supports GRUU and returns a
   REGISTER response, the user agent SHOULD search within the REGISTER



Munakata, et al.         Expires August 22, 2007                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP     February 2007


   response for a "temp-gruu" URI parameter, which provides the desired
   privacy property.

   If the "temp-gruu" URI parameter and value exist within the REGISTER
   response, the user agent SHOULD use the value of the "temp-gruu" as
   an anonymous URI representing the user agent.  This URI SHOULD be
   used for Contact header.

   The user agent using the "temp-gruu" as a contact URI is RECOMMENDED
   to set "Anonymous" as a display-name in any header where the display-
   name of the originator is set.  That indicates the anonymity of the
   request to intermediaries that may invoke some services based on the
   anonymity of the call.  The temp-gruu alone is not sufficient to
   invoke such service because GRUU is merely a URI that is a sequence
   of strings and digits with no explicit semantics to indicate that it
   is an anonymous URI.

   If there is no "temp-gruu" URI parameter in the 200 response to the
   REGISTER request, a user agent SHOULD NOT proceed with its
   anonymization process, unless something equivalent to "temp-gruu" is
   provided through some administrative means.

   Note: How to obtain an anonymous URI for From and any headers other
         than the Contact is FFS.

   It is RECOMMENDED that user agent consult the user before sending a
   request without a functional anonymous URI when privacy is request
   from the user.

5.2.  Anonymous IP Address

   It is assumed that a user agent is either manually or automatically
   configured through means such as a configuration framework
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework] with the address of one or more
   STUN relay servers.

   Two IP addresses are needed to maintain privacy, one to be used in
   signaling such as in a Via header, another to be used in SDP for
   media.

   A user agent that is not provided with a functional anonymous IP
   address through some administrative means, SHOULD obtain a relayed
   address (IP address of the media relay) for use in SDP, derived from
   a STUN [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] relay server using the STUN relay
   usage, which allows a STUN server to act as a media relay.

Internet-Draft     UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP     February 2007


   Note: A relayed IP address may be used for a Via header, but some
         commented that is not an appropriate to be used for signaling.
         There was a comment about the IP address in Via being stripped
         by the proxy, but that would require that a proxy compliant to
         this specification is in the signaling path.


6.  User Agent Behavior

   A user agent fully compliant with this document SHOULD obscure or
   conceal all the UA-inserted privacy-sensitive information in SIP
   requests and responses when user privacy is requested.  Section 6.1
   describes how to generate an anonymous message at a user agent.

   When a user agent generates an anonymous message based on this
   specification, it SHOULD set an indication to tell intermediaries not
   to add privacy-sensitive information.  Section 6.2 describes more
   about this.

6.1.  Generating Anonymous Message

   The two pieces of information that a user agent needs to obscure
   while sustaining its purpose and functionality are the URI and IP
   address used for establishing a media/signaling session.
   Instructions on how to obtain an functional anonymous URI and IP
   address are given in Section 5.1 and 5.2, respectively.

   For anonymizing any headers and information in a SIP message, the
   user agent SHOULD follow the instructions in this document.

   Note: Instructions to treat each SIP header/parameter in generating
         an anonymous SIP message will be given in a future version of
         this draft.

6.2.  Indication to Maintain Privacy

   This document defines a privacy flag, which indicates that the user
   requires privacy for the SIP message.  Without a privacy flag,
   intermediaries might add some privacy-sensitive information in the
   message, even if a user agent had anonymized the message as perfectly
   as possible.

   When a user agent generates an anonymous message by itself according
   to the guidelines in Section 6.1, it SHOULD set a flag to request
   intermediaries not to add privacy-sensitive information.

Internet-Draft     UA-Driven Privacy Mechanism for SIP     February 2007


   Note: The mechanism of the flag is FFS.


7.  Proxy Behavior

   When a proxy receives a SIP message containing a privacy flag, the
   proxy compliant with this specification MUST NOT add any information
   that may reveal something about the sender that is irrelevant to
   routing unless the proxy knows that such information will be deleted
   before it leaves the boundary of the Trust Domain[RFC3324].

   A proxy MUST NOT modify the privacy flag, if present.
