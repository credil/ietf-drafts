    <abstract>
      <t>The ETX metric of a wireless link is the expected number of
      transmissions required to successfully transmit and acknowledge
      a packet on the link. The Routing Protocol for Low Power
      and Lossy Networks (RPL) allows the use of objective functions
      to construct routes that optimize or constrain a routing metric
      on the paths. This specification describes ETXOF, an objective
      function that minimizes ETX. The RPL path computation using
      ETXOF results in minimum-ETX paths from the nodes to the DAG
      roots, i.e., paths that minimize the number of packet
      transmissions for packet delivery from nodes in the network to
      the DAG root.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>An objective function allows
      RPL <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref> to optimize or
      constrain the routing metric of a path. RPL achieves this goal
      by selecting the parent among the alternate parents as dictated
      by that objective function. For example, if an RPL instance uses
      an objective function that minimizes hop-count, RPL will select
      paths with minimum hop count. Different objective functions
      optimize or constrain different metrics.</t>

      <t>The ETX metric describes the expected number of transmissions
      required to successfully transmit and acknowledge a packet on a
      wireless link. The ETX metric is commonly used in wireless
      routing to distinguish between paths that require a large number
      of packet transmissions from those that require a smaller number
      of packet transmissions for successful packet delivery and
      acknowledgement. The nodes running RPL might use a number of
      mechanisms to estimate the ETX metric of a
      link <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics"></xref> and
      make it available for route selection.</t>

      <t>This specification describes ETXOF, an ETX Objective function
      for RPL. ETXOF is an objective function that allows RPL to find
      a minimum-ETX path from the nodes to a root in the DAG
      instance. The minimum-ETX path between a node and the DAG root
      is the path (among other paths between the source and the
      destination) that requires the least number of packet
      transmissions per packet delivery to the DAG root. Thus,
      minimum-ETX paths are generally also the most energy-efficient
      paths in the network.</t>

    <section title="The ETX Objective Function">

      <t>The ETX Objective Function, ETXOF, is designed to find the
      path that can be used to deliver a packet from a node to the
      root in a DAG instance with the least number of
      transmissions. It does so by using the ETX metric defined
      in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics"></xref> as the
      link metric, computing a ETX Path metric based on the ETX link
      metric, and choosing paths with the smallest path ETX.</t>

      <section title="Computing the ETX Path metric">
	
	<t>Nodes compute the ETX Path metric for each candidate
	  neighbor reachable on all the interfaces. The ETX Path
	  metric represents the ETX cost of the path from a node to
	  the root of the DODAG through the neighbor. </t>
	
	<t>Root nodes (Grounded or
	  Floating) set the variable min_path_etx to
	  MIN_ETX_PATH_CONST.</t>
	
	<t>A non-root node computes the ETX Path metric for a path
	  to the root through each candidate neighbor by adding these
	  two components:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers">
	    <t> The ETX metric for the link to a candidate neighbor</t>
	    <t> The min_path_etx advertised by that neighbor.</t>
	  </list></t>

	  <t>A node SHOULD compute the ETX Path metric for the path
	  through each candidate neighbor reachable through all 
	  interfaces. If a node cannot compute the ETX path metric for
          the path through a
	  candidate neighbor, the node MUST NOT make that candidate
          neighbor its preferred parent.</t>

	  <t>If the ETX metric of the link to a neighbor is not
	    available, the ETX Path metric for the path through that
	    neighbor SHOULD be set to INFINITY. This metric value will
	    prevent this path from being considered for path selection,
	    hence avoiding potentially high ETX paths.</t>


	<t>The ETX Path metric corresponding to a neighbor MUST be
	re-computed each time:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers">
	  <t>The ETX metric of the link to the candidate neighbor is
	  updated.</t>
	  <t>A node receives a new min_path_etx advertisement from the
	  candidate neighbor.</t>
	</list></t>

	<t>This computation MAY also be performed
	periodically. However, long intervals between periodic
	computation or deferring the computation for too long after
	new min_path_etx advertisements or updates to the link metric
	prevents a node from making parent selection decision based on
	the most up-to-date link and path quality information.</t>


      </section>

      <section title="Parent Selection">

	<t>After computing the ETX Path metric for all the candidate
	neighbors reachable through all the interfaces for the current
	DODAG iteration, a node selects the preferred parent. This
	process is called parent selection.</t>

	<t>A node MUST select a candidate neighbor as its preferred
	parent if the ETX Path metric corresponding to that neighbor
	is smaller than the ETX Path metric corresponding to the rest
	of the neighbors, except as indicated below:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers">

	  <t>If the ETX Path metric of the current preferred parent is
	    greater than the smallest ETX Path metric by less than
	    PARENT_SWITCH_ETX_THRESHOLD, the node MAY continue to use
	    the current preferred parent.</t>

	  <t>A node MAY declare itself as a Floating root, and hence
	    no preferred parent, depending on the configuration.</t>

	  <t>If the ETX metric for a link is greater than
	    MAX_ETX_LINK_CONST, the node SHOULD exclude that link from
	    consideration for parent selection.</t>

	  <t>If min_path_etx is greater than MAX_ETX_PATH_CONST, the
	    node MAY declare itself as a Floating root.</t>

	  <t>If the configuration disallows a node to be a Floating
	  root and no neighbors are discovered, the node does not have
	  a preferred parent, and MUST set min_path_etx to
	  INFINITY.</t>

	  <t>If the ETX Path metric corresponding to multiple
	    candidate neighbors are equal to min_path_etx, a node MAY
	    use a different objective function to select the preferred
	    parent among the candidates with the ETX Path metric equal
	    to min_path_etx. If the current preferred parent is one of
	    the candidates with the ETX Path metric equal to
	    min_path_etx, the node SHOULD continue to use the current
	    preferred parent. Continuing to use the same parent
	    prevents potential churn in the network.</t>
	</list></t>

      </section>

      <section title="Advertising the ETX Path metric">
	<t>Once the preferred parent is selected, the node sets its
	min_path_etx variable to the ETX Path metric corresponding to
	the preferred parent. Thus, min_path_etx is the cost of the
	minimum-ETX path from the node to the root. The value of the
	min_path_etx is carried in the metric container whenever DIO
	messages are sent.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="ETXOF Constants, Variables, and Parameters">
      
      <t>ETXOF uses the following variable:</t>

      <t><list>
	<t>min_path_etx: The ETX path metric of the path from a node
	through its preferred parent to the root computed at the last
	parent selection.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>ETXOF uses the following constants:</t>

      <t><list>
	<t>MIN_ETX_LINK_CONST: 1.0</t>
	<t>MIN_ETX_PATH_CONST: 1.0</t>
      </list></t>


      <t>ETXOF uses the following parameters:</t>

      <t><list>
	<t>MAX_ETX_LINK_CONST: Maximum allowed link ETX.</t>

	<t>MAX_ETX_PATH_CONST: Maximum allowed path ETX.</t>

	<t>PARENT_SWITCH_ETX_THRESHOLD: The difference between ETX of
	   the path through the preferred parent and the minimum-ETX
	   path to trigger new preferred parent selection.</t>
