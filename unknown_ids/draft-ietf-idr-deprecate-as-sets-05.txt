          Deprecation of the use of BGP AS_SET, AS_CONFED_SET.
                  draft-ietf-idr-deprecate-as-sets-05

Abstract

   This document deprecates the use of the AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET
   types of the AS_PATH in BGPv4.  This is done to simplify the design
   and implementation of the BGP protocol and to make the semantics of
   the originator of a route more clear.  This will also simplify the
   design, implementation and deployment of ongoing work in the Secure
   Inter-Domain Routing Working Group.

Internet-Draft    AS_SET, AS_CONFED_SET use deprecation        July 2011


1.  Introduction

   The AS_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH attribute ([RFC4271],
   Section 4.3) is created by a router that is performing route
   aggregation and contains an unordered set of ASs that the update has
   traversed.  The AS_CONFED_SET path type ([RFC5065]) of the AS_PATH
   attribute is created by a router that is performing route aggregation
   and contains an unordered set of Member AS Numbers in the local
   confederation that the update has traversed.  It is very similar to
   AS_SETs but is used within a confederation.

   By performing aggregation, a router is, in essence, combining
   multiple existing routes into a single new route.  This type of
   aggregation blurs the semantics of what it means to originate a route
   which can cause operational issues that include reachability problems
   and traffic engineering issues.

   From analysis of past Internet routing data it is apparent that
   aggregation that involves AS_SETs is very seldom used in practice on
   the public network [analysis] and, when it is used, it is usually
   used incorrectly -- reserved AS numbers ([RFC1930]) and / or only a
   single AS in the AS_SET are by far the most common case.  The
   reduction in table size provided by the aggregation is outweighed by
   additional complexity in the BGP protocol and confusion regarding
   what exactly is meant by originating a route.

   In the past AS_SET had been used in a few rare cases to allow route
   aggregation where two or more providers could form the same prefix,
   using the exact match of the others prefix in some advertisement and
   configuring the aggregation differently elsewhere.  The key to
   configuring this correctly was to form the aggregate at the border in
   the outbound BGP policy and omit prefixes from the AS that the
   aggregate was being advertised to.  The AS_SET therefore allowed this
   practice without the loss of BGP's AS_PATH loop protection.  This use
   of AS_SET served a purpose which fell in line with the original
   intended use.

   Without AS_SET aggregates must always contain only less specific
   prefixes (not less than or equal to), and must never aggregate an
   exact match.  Since this practice is thought to no longer be widely
   used, it is thought to be safe to deprecate the use of AS_SET.


2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Recommendation to Network Operators

   Operators are strongly advised to not generate any new announcements
   containing AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs.  If they have already announced
   routes with AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs in them, then they should
   withdraw and re-announce those prefixes without AS_SETs in the
   updates.  This may require undoing the aggregation that was
   previously performed, and announcing more specifics.  Route
   aggregation that was previously performed by proxy aggregation is
   still possible under some conditions without the use of AS_SETs.  As
   with any change, the operator should understand the full implications
   of the change.

   It is worth noting that new technologies (such as those that take
   advantage of the "X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS
   Identifiers" ([RFC3779]) may not support routes with AS_SETs /
   AS_CONFED_SETs in them, and MAY treat as infeasible routes containing
   them.  Future BGP implementations may also do the same.

   It is expected that, even before the deployment of these
   technologies, operators may begin filtering routes that contain
   AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document discourages the use of aggregation techniques that
   create AS_SETs.  Future work may update the protocol to remove
   support for the AS_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH attribute.
   This will remove complexity and code that is not exercised very
   often, which decreases the attack surface.  This will also simplify
   the design and implementation of the RPKI and systems that will rely
   on it.
