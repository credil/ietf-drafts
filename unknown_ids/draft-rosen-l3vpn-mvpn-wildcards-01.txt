                    MVPN: S-PMSI Wild Card Selectors


                draft-rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-wildcards-01.txt

Abstract

   In the procedures for Multicast Virtual Private Networks, individual
   customer multicast flows can be assigned to specific multicast
   tunnels through a service provider network.  This document specifies
   the encoding and semantics of "wild card selectors", which can be
   used to assign certain sets of customer multicast flows as a group to
   specific multicast tunnels.

Internet Draft   draft-rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-wildcards-01.txt       July 2010


1. Specification of requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. Introduction

   Note: this document uses terminology from [MVPN], and in particular
   uses the prefixes "C-" and "P-" as specified in section 3.1 of
   [MVPN].

   As specified in [MVPN] and [MVPN-BGP], one can use an S-PMSI A-D
   route or an S-PMSI Join Message to assign a particular C-multicast
   flow, identified as (C-S,C-G), to a particular S-PMSI.

   However, [MVPN-BGP] does not specify any means of encoding wild cards
   ("*", in multicast terminology) in the Source or Group fields.
   Similarly, [MVPN] does not specify any means of encoding wild cards
   in the C-Source or C-Group fields of the S-PMSI Join messages.

   This omission makes it difficult to provide optimized multicast
   routing for customers that use ASM ("Any Source Multicast")
   multicasts, in which flows may be traveling along "shared" C-trees.
   We use the term "shared C-trees" to refer both to the the
   unidirectional "RPT trees" used in "PIM sparse mode" [PIM], and to
   the bidirectional trees used in BIDIR-PIM [BIDIR-PIM].

   When a customer is using ASM multicast, it is useful to be able to
   select the set of flows that are traveling along a shared C-tree, and
   to bind that entire set of flows to a specified P-tunnel.
   Conceptually, we would like to have a way to express that we want
   (C-*,C-G) traffic bound to the specified P-tunnel.  A multicast data
   packet whose source address is C-S and whose destination address is
   an ASM group address is said to be traveling a shared C-tree from the
   perspective of a given router if that router's decision to forward
   the packet is based upon (C-*,C-G) state rather than upon (C-S,C-G)
   state.  Creation and use of these multicast states is specified in
   [PIM] and/or [MVPN-BGP].

   Another useful feature would be a way of using an S-PMSI A-D route to
   say "by default, all multicast traffic (within a given VPN) that has
   not been bound to any other P-tunnel is bound to the specified
   P-tunnel".  To do this we, need to have a way to express that we want
   (C-*, C-*) traffic bound to the P-tunnel.

   The Wild Card Selectors specified in this document provide additional

Internet Draft   draft-rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-wildcards-01.txt       July 2010


   functionality:

     - One can send an S-PMSI A-D route or S-PMSI Join Message whose
       semantics are "assign all the traffic traveling the (C-*,C-G)
       tree to this S-PMSI".

     - One can send an S-PMSI A-D route or S-PMSI Join Message whose
       semantics are "use this S-PMSI as the default method for carrying
       any (C-S,C-G) or (C-*,C-G) traffic that isn't assigned to a
       different S-PMSI".  That is, it allows for the use of S-PMSIs as
       the default PMSIs for carrying data traffic.

   This document specifies the encoding of the wild card selectors, and
   provides rules for their usage and interpretation when S-PMSIs are
   instantiated as unidirectional P-tunnels.  Rules for their usage and
   interpretation when S-PMSIs are instantiated as bidirectional
   P-tunnels may be found in [MVPN_BIDIR].

   In the following, we will sometimes talk of a PE receiving traffic
   from a PMSI and then discarding it.  If PIM is being used as the
   multicast control protocol between PEs, this always implies that the
   discarded traffic will not be seen by PIM on the receiving PE.

   In the following, we will sometimes speak of an S-PMSI A-D route
   being "ignored".  When we say the route is "ignored", we do not mean
   that its normal BGP processing is not done, but that the route is not
   considered when determining which P-tunnel to use when sending
   multicast data, and that the MPLS label values it conveys are not
   used.  We will generally use "ignore" in quotes to indicate this
   meaning.


3. Encoding of Wild Cards

   This specification therefore establishes the following conventions:

     - In an S-PMSI A-D route, the use of a zero length source or group
       field is to be interpreted as specifying a wild card value for
       the respective field. A single wild card represents all Multicast
       Source or Multicast Group values of all address families; there
       is no need to use a different wild card for IPv4 addresses than
       is used for IPv6 addresses.

     - In an S-PMSI Join message, the use of an all-zero C-Source or
       C-Group field is to be interpreted as specifying a wild card
       value for the respective field.  A wild card represents all
       C-Source or C-group values of a particular address family (IPv4
       or IPv6), as specified by the S-PMSI Join message type.

Internet Draft   draft-rosen-l3vpn-mvpn-wildcards-01.txt       July 2010


   When wildcards are used, the following two combinations MUST BE
   supported:

     - (C-*,C-G): Source Wildcard, Group specified.

     - (C-*,C-*): Source Wildcard, Group Wildcard.

   This specification does not provide support for the combination of a
   specified source and a group wildcard.  A received S-PMSI A-D route
   or S-PMSI Join message specifying this combination will be "ignored".


4. Binding Wild Cards to Unidirectional P-Tunnels

4.1. Binding (C-*,C-G) to a Unidirectional P-Tunnel

   Consider an S-PMSI A-D Route whose NLRI specifies (C-*,C-G), and that
   contains a PMSI Tunnel Attribute (PTA) [MVPN-BGP] that specifies a
   unidirectional P-tunnel.  The P-tunnel may be a P2MP LSP, or it may
   be a unidirectional PIM-created multicast distribution tree specified
   either as (P-*,P-G) or as (P-S,P-G).

   Alternately, consider an S-PMSI Join message, whose C-Source and
   C-Group fields specify (C-*,C-G), and that specifies a unidirectional
   P-tunnel (either a P2MP LSP or a unidirectional PIM-created multicast
   distribution tree.)

   If C-G is known to be an SSM group address, the S-PMSI A-D route or
   S-PMSI Join message is "ignored".

   The semantics of binding (C-*,C-G) to a unidirectional P-tunnel are
   the following: the originator of the S-PMSI A-D route or S-PMSI Join
   message is saying that if it receives, over a VRF interface, any
   traffic that is traveling on the (C-*,C-G) shared tree, and if it is
   to forward such traffic to other PEs, then it will transmit such
   traffic on the specified P-tunnel.  Any PE interested in receiving
   (C-*,C-G) traffic from the originator (i.e., if the originator is
   PE's upstream multicast hop for the (C-*,C-G) state) MUST join that
   P-tunnel.

4.2. Binding (C-*,C-*) to a Unidirectional P-Tunnel

   The originator of an S-PMSI A-D Route or an S-PMSI Join message that
   binds (C-*,C-*) to a unidirectional P-tunnel is saying that by
   default, if it is required by its C-PIM instance to forward multicast
   traffic to any other PE, then by default it will send the traffic on
   the specified tunnel.  The default applies to any traffic that has
   not been explicitly assigned to another P-tunnel.


5. Use of Wild Cards with Bidirectional P-Tunnels

   The specification for the use of wild cards with bidirectional
   P-Tunnels can be found in [MVPN_BIDIR].


6. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no actions of IANA.


7. Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations beyond those of
   [MVPN] and [MVPN-BGP].
