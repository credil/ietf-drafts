Internet-Draft     RSVP-TE Ext for MPLS-TP OAM Config       October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a method for the configuration of MPLS
   Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Operations, Administration and
   Maintenance (OAM) functionalities through extensions to RSVP-TE.

   The procedures included describe Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
   (BFD) configuration for Continuity Check (CC) and Connection
   Verification (CV).  Updated versions of this document will describe
   the configuration of the remaining MPLS-TP OAM functionalities.

   The future updates of this document are meant to proceed consequently
   to the upcoming MPLS-TP documents defining the MPLS-TP specific OAM
   functionalities and with [MPLS-TP-IDENTIF] which specifies
   identifiers for MPLS-TP objects.

1.1.  Contributing Authors

   The editors gratefully acknowledge the precious contributions of Lou
   Berger, Annamaria Fulignoli, Andras Kern, David Jocha, David
   Sinicrope, Attila Takacs and Benoit Tremblay.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.3.  Background

   MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP), describes a profile of MPLS that
   enables operational models typical in transport networks, while
   providing additional OAM, survivability and other maintenance
   functions not currently supported by MPLS.

   For the cases where a control plane is used with MPLS-TP, the GMPLS
   control plane, RSVP-TE [RFC3471] and/or OSPF-TE [RFC3630] ISIS-TE
   [5307] has been chosen to support the establishment of MPLS-TP LSPs.

   [MPLS-TP-OAM-REQ] defines the requirements by which the OAM
   functionality of MPLS-TP should abide.

   The MPLS-TP design team provided recommendations regarding the
   functionalities that should be covered by the existing toolsets and
   which extensions or new tools will be needed in order to provide full
   coverage of the OAM functionalities for MPLS-TP.  A detailed overview
   of the adopted OAM tools will be documented in [MPLS-TP OAM
   Analysis].

Internet-Draft     RSVP-TE Ext for MPLS-TP OAM Config       October 2009


   This document provides extensions to RSVP-TE in order to accommodate
   the MPLS-TP CC (Continuity Check) and CV (Connectivity Verification)
   MPLS-TP OAM functionalities.  Further revisions of this document will
   describe RSVP-TE extensions for the other MPLS-TP OAM functionalities
   as needed.

   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD), as described in [BFD],
   defines a protocol that provides low-overhead, short-duration
   detection of failures in the path between two forwarding engines,
   including the interfaces, data link(s), and to the extent possible
   the forwarding engines themselves.  BFD can be used to track the
   liveliness of MPLS-TP point-to-point and p2mp connections and detect
   data plane failures.  This version of the draft is focused on
   unidirectional and bidirectional p2p connection.

   BFD has been chosen to cover MPLS-TP CC functionality.

   An extended version of BFD, as described in [BFD-CV], has been chosen
   to accomplish both MPLS-TP CC and CV.


2.  Overview of BFD OAM operation

   BFD is a simple hello protocol that in many respects is similar to
   the detection components of well-known routing protocols.  A pair of
   system transmits BFD packets periodically over each path between the
   two systems, and if a system stops receiving BFD packets for long
   enough, some component in that particular bidirectional path to the
   neighboring system is assumed to have failed.  Systems may also
   negotiate to not send periodic BFD packets in order to reduce
   overhead.

   A path is only declared to be operational when two-way communication
   has been established between systems, though this does not preclude
   the use of unidirectional links.

   [BFD] sect. 3 states that a separate BFD session is created for each
   communications path and data protocol in use between two systems.

   Each system estimates how quickly it can send and receive BFD packets
   in order to come to an agreement with its neighbor about how rapidly
   detection of failure will take place.  These estimates can be
   modified in real time in order to adapt to unusual situations.  This
   design also allows for fast systems on a shared medium with a slow
   system to be able to more rapidly detect failures between the fast
   systems while allowing the slow system to participate to the best of
   its ability.

   The ability of each system to control the BFD packet transmission
   rate in both directions provides a mechanism for congestion control,
   particularly when BFD is used across multiple network hops.

   As recommended in [BFD-CV], the BFD tool needs to be extended for the
   CV functionality by the addition of a unique identifier in order to
   meet the requirements.  The document in [BFD-CV] specifies the BFD
   extension and behavior to meet the requirements for MPLS-TP proactive
   Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification functionality and the
   RDI functionality as defined in [MPLS-TP-OAM-REQ].


3.  RSVP-TE Extensions

3.1.  Operation overview

   Below, extension to RSVP-TE for setting up BFD or BFD extended
   version are defined in order to configure MPLS-TP CC and CV OAM
   functionalities during the LSP setup.

   The terms "ingress LER" and "egress LER" will not refer in this
   document to any direction in the forwarding plane, but only to the
   LER triggering the LSP setup (ingress LER) and the one triggering the
   response to it (egress LER).

   During the LSP signaling, the Control Plane instance in the ingress
   and the egress LER announces the BFD OAM Configuration TLV (inside
   the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object carried by the Path and Resv message
   respectively), which includes the "Local Discriminator" sub-TLV.
   During the BFD session the ingress LER will use as "MyDiscriminator"
   the value announced in the "Local Discriminator"(Path message) and as
   "YourDiscriminator" the value received in the "Local Discriminator"
   (Resv message).

   The system initiating the signaling MUST advertise the interval value
   at which it requires BFD control packets both in transmission and
   reception.  If the receiving system can not support this value, a new
   value can be signaled back in the Resv message, with the constraint
   that the new value MUST be comprised between the Maximum and Minimum
   values indicated by the ingress.  If the egress system can not
   support any value in the indicated range, it will reply with an
   error.

   In the case BFD extended version should be configured, the unique MEP
   ID parameter MUST be included along with the Discriminator and timing
   values as described in the following sections.

3.2.  OAM Configuration TLV

   Below is reported the "OAM Configuration TLV", defined in [OAM-CONF-
   FWK].  It specifies which OAM technology/method should be used for
   the LSP.  The OAM Configuration TLV is carried in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES
   object in Path messages.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Type: indicates the OAM Configuration TLV (2) (IANA to assign).

   OAM Type: one octect that specifies the technology specific OAM Type.
   If the requested OAM Type is not supported an error must be
   generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported OAM Type".

   In this document a new OAM Type - OAM Type 2 - is defined: MPLS-TP
   OAM.

                        +----------+--------------+
                        | OAM Type | Description  |
                        +----------+--------------+
                        | 0        | Reserved     |
                        | 1        | Ethernet OAM |
                        | 2        | MPLS-TP OAM  |
                        | 3-256    | Reserved     |
                        +----------+--------------+

   The receiving node when the BFD OAM Type is requested should look for
     the corresponding technology specific BFD OAM configuration TLV.

   OAM Function Flags: a two octect field that specifies pro-active OAM
   functions that should be established and configured.  If the selected
   OAM Function(s) is(are) not supported an error must be generated:
   "OAM Problem/Unsupported OAM Function".

   The Flag 0 was already in use for "Connectivity Monitoring" and it
   will be used in this document to establish MPLS-TP Continuity Check
   (CC) functionality.  A new Flag 3 is defined here and will be used to
   establish MPLS-TP Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification (CC
   & CV) functionality.  Control Plane control of on Demand functions
   are for further studies.

   The following table summarizes the Flags usage.

   +----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
   | OAM Type | Description                                            |
   +----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
   | 0        | Continuity Check (CC)                                  |
   | 1        | Reserved                                               |
   | 2        | Reserved                                               |
   | 3        | Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification (CC&CV) |
   | 4-16     | Reserved                                               |
   +----------+--------------------------------------------------------+

   The receiving LER when the MPLS-TP OAM Type is requested should check
   which Flags are set and look for the corresponding technology
   specific configuration TLV.

      - "BFD CC OAM Configuration TLV" which MUST be used if Flag = 0
      for configuring BFD for setting up the proactive MPLS-TP CC OAM
      tool (TLV type = 4, IANA to define);

      - "BFD CC&CV OAM Configuration TLV" which MUST be used if Flag = 3
      for configuring BFD for setting up the proactive MPLS-TP CC&CV OAM
      tool (TLV type = 5, IANA to define).

   In case the receiving LER does not support the CC&CV functionality,
   an error "OAM Problem/Unsupported BFD functionality" must be
   generated when receiving the BFD CC&CV OAM Configuration TLV.

3.3.  BFD CC OAM Configuration TLV

   The BFD CC OAM Configuration TLV (depicted below) is defined for BFD
   OAM specific configuration parameters.  The BFD CC OAM Configuration
   TLV is carried as a sub-TLV of the "OAM Configuration TLV" in the
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES object both in Path and Resv messages.

   This new TLV accommodates generic BFD OAM information and carries
   sub-TLVs.

   R Flag: Role Flag.  If set, the receiving node is required to act
   with an Active Role as described in [BFD] sect. 6.1.  When the BFD
   OAM Configuration TLV is carried in the Resv message, the flag is not
   taken into consideration by the receiving node.

   The BFD CC OAM Configuration TLV MUST include the following sub-TLVs
   in the Path message:

      - "Local Discriminator" sub-TLV;

      - "Suggested TX interval" sub-TLV.

   The BFD CC OAM Configuration TLV MUST include the following sub-TLVs
   in the Resv message:

      - "Local Discriminator" sub-TLV;

      - "Suggested TX interval" sub-TLV if a different timing value
      needs to be used.

   that the system initiating the signaling want to have when both
   transmitting and receiving BFD Control packets, less any jitter
   applied.  The value zero is reserved.  If the receiving system can
   not support this value, a new value can be signaled back in the Resv
   message, with the constraint that the new value will be not higher
   than "Acceptable Max. Asynchronous TX interval" and not lower than
   "Acceptable Min. Asynchronous TX interval".

   Acceptable Min. Asynchronous TX interval: the maximum TX interval, in
   microseconds, that the system initiating the signaling can support.
   In case the receiving system sends back this TLV for proposing a
   different "Suggested Asynchronous TX interval", the "Acceptable Min.
   Asynchronous TX interval" will not be taken into consideration by the
   system which initiated the signaling.

   Acceptable Max. Asynchronous TX interval: the minimum TX interval, in
   microseconds, that the system initiating the signaling can support.
   In case the receiving system sends back this TLV for proposing a
   different "Suggested Asynchronous TX interval", the "Acceptable Max.
   Asynchronous TX interval" will not be taken into consideration by the
   system which initiated the signaling.

   Required Echo TX Interval: the minimum interval, in microseconds,
   between received BFD Echo packets that this system is capable of
   supporting, less any jitter applied by the sender as described in
   [BFD] sect. 6.8.9.  This value is also an indication for the
   receiving system of the minimum interval between transmitted BFD Echo
   packets.  If this value is zero, the transmitting system does not
   support the receipt of BFD Echo packets.  If the receiving system can
   not support this value an error MUST be generated "Unsupported BFD TX
   rate interval"

3.4.  BFD CC&CV OAM Configuration TLV

   The BFD CC&CV OAM Configuration TLV (depicted below) is defined for
   BFD OAM specific configuration parameters.  The BFD CC&CV OAM
   Configuration TLV is carried as a sub-TLV of the "OAM Configuration
   TLV" in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object both in Path and Resv messages.

   This new TLV accommodates generic BFD OAM information and carries
   sub-TLVs.

   Type: indicates a new type, the BFD CC&CV OAM Configuration TLV (5)
   (IANA to define).

   Length: indicates the TLV total length (in octects) including sub-
   TLVs.

   Version: identifies the BFD protocol version.  If a node does not
   support a specific BFD version an error must be generated: "OAM
   Problem/Unsupported OAM Version"

   R Flag: Role Flag.  If set, the receiving node is required to act
   with an Active Role as described in [BFD] sect. 6.1.  When the BFD
   OAM Configuration TLV is carried in the Resv message, the flag it not
   taken into consideration by the receiving node.

   The BFD CC&CV OAM Configuration TLV MUST include the following sub-
   TLVs in the Path message:

      - "Local Discriminator" sub-TLV;

      - "Suggested TX interval" sub-TLV;

      - "Source unique MEP-ID" sub-TLV.

   The BFD CC&CV OAM Configuration TLV MUST include the following sub-
   TLVs in the Resv message:

      - "Local Discriminator" sub-TLV;

      - "Suggested TX interval" sub-TLV if a different timing value
      needs to be used;

      - "Source unique MEP-ID" sub-TLV.

3.4.1.  Source unique MEP-ID sub-TLV

   The MPLS Generic Associated Channel specification (see[RFC5586] sect.
   3) describes the ACH TLV structure that can be used to provide
   additional context information to the G-ACh packet.

   In this section it is showed how the "Source unique MEP-ID" sub-TLV
   in the BFD CC&CV OAM Configuration TLV can be used to configure the
   TLV Objects in the ACH TLV for providing the MEP Identifier
   information and the ME Identifier information as required by[MPLS-TP-
   OAM-FWK].

   Length: indicates the TLV total length (in octects) including sub-
   TLVs.

   Source unique MEP-ID: the unique MEP Identifier of the source of the
   BFD packet.  Please refer to [MPLS-TP-IDENTIF] for a detailed
   explanation of the field composition and to possible changes of the
   field definition.  As the writing time, the "Source unique MEP-ID" is
   defined to be the Network_IF_ID.  The Network_IF_ID is also defined
   in [MPLS-TP-IDENTIF], section 4.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies the following new TLV types.

   sub-TLVs types to be carried in the OAM Configuration TLV in
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES:

      - "BFD CC OAM Configuration" sub-TLV type: 4

      - "BFD CC&CV OAM Configuration" sub-TLV type (to be carried in the
      OAM Configuration TLV in LSP_ATTRIBUTES): 5

   sub-TLV types to be carried in the BFD OAM Configuration sub-TLV:

Internet-Draft     RSVP-TE Ext for MPLS-TP OAM Config       October 2009


      - "Local Discriminator" sub-TLV type: 1

      - "Suggested TX interval" sub-TLV type: 2

      - "Source unique MEP-ID" sub-TLV type: 3


5.  BFD OAM configuration errors

   In addition to error values specified in [OAM-CONF-FWK] and [ETH-OAM]
   this document defines the following values for the "OAM Problem"
   Error Code:

      - "OAM Problem/Unsupported BFD functionality"

      - "OAM Problem/Unsupported BFD TX rate interval"

      - "OAM Problem/Unsupported MEP ID Format"


6.  Security Considerations

   The signaling of OAM related parameters and the automatic
   establishment of OAM entities introduces additional security
   considerations to those discussed in [RFC3473].  In particular, a
   network element could be overloaded, if an attacker would request
   liveliness monitoring, with frequent periodic messages, for a high
   number of LSPs, targeting a single network element.

   Security aspects will be covered in more detailed in subsequent
   versions of this document.
