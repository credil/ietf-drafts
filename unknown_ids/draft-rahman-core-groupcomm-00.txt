                     draft-rahman-core-groupcomm-00

Abstract

   This is a working document intended to trigger discussion and develop
   draft language for the CoAP protocol specification in the area of
   group communication (including multicast functionality).  Engineering
   tradeoffs become more challenging in constrained environments,
   therefore group communication is considered within the context of
   adjacent topics that may impact or be impacted by design choices in
   the subject area.

Internet-Draft        Group Communication for CoAP          October 2010


1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following are definitions of terminologies used in this draft.

   Multicast: A solution based on the use of multicast addresses as
   defined in "IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture" [RFC4291].

   Group Communication: One source node sends a CoAP message to more
   than one destination node.  The source and destination nodes can be
   constrained or non-constrained nodes.  This may include serial
   unicast, multicast, or hybrid unicast-to-multicast solutions.


2.  Introduction

2.1.  Background

   The CoRE working group is chartered to design and standardize a
   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for resource constrained
   devices and networks [I-D.ietf-core-coap].  The requirements for CoRE
   are documented in [I-D.shelby-core-coap-req].

   In this draft, we focus and expand discussions on requirements
   pertaining to multicast support, including:

      REQ 9: CoAP will support a non-reliable IP multicast message to be
      sent to a group of Devices to manipulate a resource on all the
      Devices simultaneously.  The use of multicast to query and
      advertise descriptions must be supported, along with the support
      of unicast responses.

   Currently, the CoAP protocol [I-D.ietf-core-coap] supports unreliable
   multicast using UDP.  It defines the unreliable multicast operation
   as follows:

      "Multicast messages SHOULD be Non-Confirmable.  If a Confirmable
      multicast message is sent then retransmission MUST NOT be
      performed.  Furthermore, a destination end-point to a multicast
      Confirmable message MUST only send an Acknowledgment if the
      response code included indicates success (Code = 2XX) in order to
      eliminate error code response floods."

   Additional requirements were introduced in [I-D.vanderstok-core-bc]
   driven by quality of experience issues in commercial lighting; the

   need for large numbers of devices to respond with near simultaneity
   to a command (multicast PUT), and for that command to be received
   reliably (reliable multicast).

2.2.  Problem Statement and Scope

   In this draft, we expand the scope from unreliable multicast in the
   current CoAP requirement to group communication, using either
   (reliable or unreliable) multicast or unicast.

   Machine-to-Machine (M2M) networks may contain groups of servers that
   are highly correlated (e.g.,, by type or location).  For example, all
   smart meters in a region may belong to one group, and all light
   switches in a building control system belong to another.  Group
   communication can increase the efficiency of communication and reduce
   bandwidth requirements for a given application.

   In the following sections, we address the issues related to group
   communication in detail, with proposed solutions and analysis of
   impacts to the CoAP protocol and implementations.


3.  Multicast Solutions

   The classic model of a multicast application is that of a single
   source distributing content to many recipients.  Multicast solutions
   have evolved from "bottom" to "top", i.e., from the network layer (IP
   multicast) to application layer multicast.  A study published in 2005
   identified new solutions in the "middle" (referred to as overlay
   multicast) that utilize an infrastructure based on proxies [STUDY1].

   Each of these classes of multicast solutions may be compared using
   metrics such as link stress and level of host complexity [STUDY2].
   The approach adopted here is to begin with IP multicast and present a
   complete picture to introduce some key concepts, then expand to cover
   more general scenarios such as group management and CoAP-to-HTTP
   proxies.

3.1.  IP Multicast

   IP Multicast protocols have been evolving for decades, resulting in
   proposed standards such as Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse
   Mode (PIM-SM) [RFC4601].  Yet, due to various technical and marketing
   reasons, IP Multicast is not widely deployed on the Internet, leading
   to alternative solutions for applications like interactive gaming and
   publish/subscribe.  However, the packet economy and minimal host
   complexity of IP multicast make it worth investigating for intra-
   domain group communication in constrained environments.

Internet-Draft        Group Communication for CoAP          October 2010


3.1.1.  Group Addressing

   The header compression proposal of 6LoWPAN [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc]
   includes a format to support Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast
   Addresses such as [RFC3956], which is itself a scheme to simplify the
   deployment of PIM-SM [RFC4601].  Since the use of header compression
   for CoAP is highly desirable, we propose the use of this addressing
   mode for IP multicast.

3.1.2.  Group URIs

   An approach to map group authorities onto multicast addresses using
   DNS was proposed in [I-D.vanderstok-core-bc].  Examples of group URI
   naming (and scope) for a building control application are shown
   below:

   //all.bldg6... "all nodes in building 6"

   //all.west.bldg6... "all nodes in west wing, building 6"

   //all.floor1.west.bldg6... "all nodes in floor 1, west wing, etc."

   //all.bu036.floor1.west.bldg6... "all nodes in office bu036, floor1,
   etc."

   Group URIs MUST follow the approach of the URI structure defined in
   [RFC3986].  The authority portion of the URI is used to identify a
   node (or group) and the resulting DNS name is bound to a unicast or
   (or multicast) address.  Each example group URI shown above would be
   mapped to a unique multicast IP addresses as defined in [RFC4291].

3.1.3.  Group Discovery

   [Need to describe how group naming/scoping as defined in the previous
   section relates to group formation and discovery.]

   CoAP defines a resource discovery capability but it is limited to
   link-local scope; examples may be found in [I-D.ietf-core-coap].  A
   service discovery capability is required to extend discovery to other
   subnets, as originally proposed in [I-D.vanderstok-core-bc].

   DNS-based Service Discovery [I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd] defines a
   conventional way to configure DNS PTR, SRV, and TXT records to enable
   enumeration of services such as CoAP nodes within subdomains.  A
   service is specified by a name of the form Instance.Type.Domain,
   where the type for CoAP nodes is _coap._udp and the domain is a DNS
   domain name that identifies a DNS zone as in the examples above.  For
   each CoAP end-point in the zone, a PTR record with the name



Rahman                   Expires April 17, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        Group Communication for CoAP          October 2010


   _coap._udp is defined and it points to an SRV record having the
   Instance.Type.Domain name.

   All CoAP nodes in a given subdomain may be enumerated by sending a
   query for PTR records named _coap._udp to the authoritative server
   for that zone.  A list of SRV records is returned.  Each SRV record
   contains the port and host name (AAAA record) of a CoAP node.  The IP
   address of the node is obtained by resolving the host name.  DNS-SD
   also specifies an optional TXT record, having the same name as the
   SRV record, which can contain "key=value" attributes.  This can be
   used to store information about the device, e.g., schema=DALI,
   type=switch, group=lighting.bldg6, etc.

   Another feature of DNS-SD is the ability to specify service subtypes
   using PTR records.  For example, one could represent all the CoAP
   groups in a subdomain by PTR records with the name
   _group._sub._coap.udp.

3.1.4.  Group Resource Manipulation

   Two forms of group resource manipulation must be supported.  The
   first is push (multicast PUT or MPUT for short) as e.g., "turn off
   all the lights simultaneously".  Logically, this is similar to
   publishing a value to multiple subscribers.  The second operation is
   pull (multicast GET or MGET), which is essential for discovery during
   comissioning and can be illustrated by the example "return all the
   resources matching a .well-known URI".  MGET should perhaps be
   limited in scope to link-local multicast.

   Conceptually, the result of a multicast GET or PUT should be the same
   as if the client had unicast them serially (that is, a set of {URI,
   representation} tuples).  Practically, there are major benefits to
   solving this problem:

      -  packet economy on constrained networks
      -  M2M resource discovery (solves the "chicken-and-egg" problem)
      -  apparent simultaneity of events (e.g., lighting applications)

   For data links (or transports) that don't support IP multicast, a
   serial unicast alternative must be provided.  In either case it
   should be possible to enumerate the members of a group.  For links
   that do support IP multicast, there are a few implications:

      -  All multicast requests MUST be sent to the well-known CoAP port







Rahman                   Expires April 17, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Group Communication for CoAP          October 2010


      -  All multicast requests SHOULD operate on /.well-known/core URIs

   One question is whether the application (or middleboxes) need to be
   aware that a request is intended for a group.  A separate scheme as
   proposed by [1998 Microsoft I-D ref] might be useful (e.g., "corem:"
   vs. "core:").

3.1.5.  Multicast Transmission Methods

3.1.5.1.  Unreliable IP Multicast

   The CoRE WG charter specified support of non-reliable multicast.  In
   the current CoAP protocol design [I-D.ietf-core-coap], unreliable
   multicast is realized by the source sending non-confirmable messages.

3.1.5.2.  Reliable IP Multicast

   [This is a difficult problem.  Need to investigate the benefits of
   repeating MGET and MPUT requests (saturation) to get "Pretty Good
   Reliability".  Use the same TID or a new TID for repeated requests?
   Carsten suggests the use of bloom filters to suppress duplicate
   responses.

   Note that non-idempotent operations (POST) cannot be supported
   without a *truly* reliable multicast protocol.]

   Reliable multicast supports guaranteed delivery of messages to a
   group of nodes.  The following specifies the requirements as was
   proposed originally in [I-D.vanderstok-core-bc]:

   Validity - If sender sends a message, m, to a group, g, of
   destinations, a path exists between sender and destinations, and the
   sender and destinations are correct, all destinations in g eventually
   receive m.

   Integrity - destination receives m at most once from sender and only
   if sender sent m to a group including destination.

   Agreement - If a correct destination of g receives m, then all
   correct destinations of g receive m.

   Timeliness - For real-time control of devices, there is a known
   constant D such that if m is sent at time t, no correct destination
   receives m after t+D.

   There are various approaches to achieve reliability, such as

Internet-Draft        Group Communication for CoAP          October 2010


      *  Destination node sends acknowledgement: in CoAP, multicast
         messages are confirmable when reliability is required.
      *  Route redundancy
      *  Source node transmits multiple times

3.1.6.  Congestion Control

   [In the case of MGET or Confirmable MPUT, servers should enforce a
   random delay within TIMEOUT before sending responses.  More
   investigation required.]

   CoAP requests may be multicast, resulting multitude of replies from
   different nodes, potentially causing congestion.
   [I-D.eggert-core-congestion-control] suggests to conservatively
   control sending multicast request.

   Various means can be implemented to prevent congestion.

   Currently in the CoAP protocol, the MAX_RETRANSMIT value is set to 5
   by default.  It is suggested that two values are used separately for
   retransmissions, one for unicast transmission between a single source
   and sink.  The current value of 5 is used for such transmission.
   Another constant is defined for multicast or group communication.
   The retransmission value for group transmission should be much lower,
   such as 1.

3.2.  Overlay Multicast

   [Discuss proxy-based multicast solutions that eliminate the need for
   router support, e.g., "IGMP/MLD Proxying" [RFC4605].]


4.  CoAP Level Group Management

   Constrained devices can be large in number, but highly correlated to
   each other.  For example, all the light switches in a building may
   belong to one group and all the thermostats belong to another group.
   All the smart meters in the same region can belong to one group as
   well.  Groups may be composed by function; for example, the group
   "all lights in building one" may consist of the groups "all lights on
   floor one of building one", "all lights on floor two of building
   one", etc.  Groups may be configured or dynamically formed.

   The CoAP protocol needs to support CoAP group management features
   independently of any underlying IP multicast support.  For example, a
   constrained node needs to be able to specify which group it intends
   to join using a CoAP request by providing the group address.

   The CoAP Proxy node would be responsible for group membership
   management.  It is proposed that CoAP supports two Header Options for
   group "join" and "leave".  These Options are Elective so they should
   be assigned an even number.  Assuming the Type for "join" is x (value
   TBD), the Header Options are illustrated by the table in Figure 1:


   +------+-----+---------------+--------------+--------+--------------+
   | Type | C/E |  Name         | Data type    | Length | Default      |
   |------+-----+---------------+--------------+--------+--------------+
   |      |     | ...   current Option Headers |..      |              |
   |      |     |                              |        |              |
   |  x   |  E  | Group Join    | String       | 1-270  | ""           |
   |      |     |               |              | B      |              |
   | x+2  |  E  | Group Leave   | String       | 1-270  | ""           |
   |      |     |               |              | B      |              |
   +------+-----|---------------+--------------+--------+--------------+

   Header Options in a CoAP message:

   Header Fields for the above example:

   Ver: 2-bit unsigned integer for CoAP Version.  Set to 1 by
   implementation as defined by the CoAP specification.

   T: 2-bit unsigned integer for CoAP Transaction Type.  Either '0'
   Confirmation or '1' Non-Confirmable can be used for group "join" or

   "leave" request.

   OC: 4-bit unsigned integer for Option Count.  For this example, the
   value should be "3" since there are three option fields.

   Code: 8-bit unsigned integer to indicate the Method in a Request or a
   Response Code in a Response message.  Any Code can be used so the
   group management can be piggy-backed in either Request or Response
   message.

   Transaction ID: 16-bit unsigned integer assigned by the source to
   uniquely identify a pair of Request and Response.

   CoAP defined a delta encoding for header options.  The first delta is
   the "Type" for group join in this specific example.  If the type for
   group join is x as illustrated in Figure 1, delta will be x.  In the
   second header option, it is also a group join so the delta is 0.  The
   third header option is a group leave so the delta is 2.


5.  Alternate Group Transmission Methods

5.1.  Serial Unicast

   Unicast can also be used for the transmission of group messages.
   When unicast is used, no IP multicast address is provided by the
   application.  Instead, the group URI must be expanded into unicast
   addresses.

5.2.  Unicast-to-Multicast

   [Discuss how a unicast message can be converted by a proxy to a CoAP
   multicast request as in Figure 3.]


6.  CoAP and HTTP Interworking

   Within the constrained network, an application protocol (e.g., CoAP)
   usually runs over UDP for which IP multicast is supported.  In a non-
   constrained network (i.e. general Internet), HTTP over TCP is
   typically used for which IP multicast is not naturally supported.
   This causes the scenario below:

      The traffic within the constrained network is multicast (such as
      CoAP over UDP), and within the non-constrained network it is
      unicast (such as HTTP over TCP)

   Therefore the proxy node needs to have functionalities to support

   interworking of unicast and multicast as illustrated in Figure 3:

7.  Security Considerations

   There is an IETF WG (msec) engaged in group security.  Additionally,
   the control plane of PIM-SM seems to require IPSec for its
   operations.  Any secure data transfers over IP multicast would seem
   to require a group keying scheme.  More investigation required.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


9.  Conclusions

   Consider the proposals for group communication described in this
   draft for incorporation into the overall CoAP protocol specification.
