Abstract

   SAM is a generic mechanism for packets whose addresses are in an
   address family to traverse routing domains where this address family

   is not directly supported.  Its topological scenarios are in the
   defined as mesh softwire class, i.e. with point to multipoint tunnels
   between border nodes so that packets never need to traverse softwire
   domains twice.  SAM exterior to interior address mappings are
   stateless, i.e; such that border nodes don't need to maintain states
   about other border nodes.  While 6to4, ISATAP, and 6rd, are already
   solutions for IPv6 tunnels across IPv4 domains, SAM supports all IPvX
   across IPvY combinations.  Also, to mitigate consequences of the IPv4
   address shortage during the transition-to-IPv6 period, SAM supports,
   for protocols that have ports to designate connection endpoints,
   port-extended IPv4 addresses.

Internet-Draft           Mesh Softwire with SAM             October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Softwires Working Group is in charge of standardizing "discovery,
   control and encapsulation methods for connecting IPv4 networks across
   IPv6 networks and IPv6 networks across IPv4 networks".  The two
   topological scenarios to deal with are identified in [RFC4925]:

   o  "Hubs and Spokes" targets carriers, or large enterprise networks
      acting as carriers, that operate Centralized Softwire
      Concentrators and use only point-to-point tunnels.

   o  "Mesh" concerns networks across which border routers communicate
      via point-to-multipoint tunnels so that no packet has to traverse
      these networks twice. covers The particular mesh scenario
      described in [RFC5565] concerns carriers, or large enterprise
      networks acting as carriers, all border routers of which support a
      common exterior Border Gateway Protocol (e-BGP).

   This draft deals with a complementary mesh scenario, suitable in
   particular for small and medium enterprises and small to medium
   Internets service providers (ISPs) that don't operate centralized
   software concentrators, for which supporting of a common e-BGP in all
   border routers in not practicable, and for which stateless operation
   is preferred for scalability and operational simplicity reasons.
   (Stateless means here that border routers don't need to maintain
   states about other border routers, a meaning similar to that used in
   Stateless DHCP [RFC3736]).

   SAM principles are an extension of principles already put in practice
   in real deployments with 6to4 [RFC3056], ISATAP [RFC5214], and in 6rd
   [RFC5569] [6rd].  They all support IPv6 across IPv4 routing domains,
   encapsulate IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets, and statelessly derive
   interior addresses from exterior addresses.

   SAM extends these solutions in the following directions:

   o  other encapsulations than just IPv6/IPv4

   o  provisions to maintain site to site transparency in IPv4 despite
      the IPv4 address shortage

   o  autoconfiguration of sub-delegated prefixes

   o  generalized multihoming support, with compatibility with ingress
      filtering in ISP networks.

   SAM has also various commonalities with some earlier proposal like
   ENCAPS (RFC 1955 in 1996), GSE (draft-ipng-gseaddr-00 in 1997), DSTM

   (draft-ietf-ngtrans-dstm in 1999-2002), LISP (draft-farinacci-lisp in
   2007-2009), RANGERS (draft-templin-ranger in 2008-2009), IVIT
   (draft-xu-behave-ivit in July 2009).  It has however a different
   scope from all of them.  In particular, while LISP is based on an
   Endpoint Identifier space separate from the Routing Locator space,
   and necessitates tunnels across the Internet core, SAM only uses
   global addresses end-to end, across some intermediate tunnels, thus
   avoiding the need for encapsulation in the Internet core, which
   facilitates incremental deployment.

   With protocols such as SCTP [RFC3286] and Shim6 [RFC5533], which
   specify how to use to multiple addresses in host endpoints, SAM,
   which introduces additional ways to assign multiple addresses to
   hosts, is complementary.

   This draft is an evolution from [SAM-02] and [SAM-03].  The former
   was focused on how NATs might be totally dispensed with in the long
   term if SAM would be generalized (somewhat theoretical).  The latter
   was limited to how SAM supports multihoming of sites having private
   internal addressing in IPv6 (practical, but too restricted).  This
   one is focused on what SAM can provide in the short term for various
   incremental deployments (more practical and more open).  It also
   introduces some technical improvements and, the author believes,
   substantial clarifications.

   The proposed specification, is the result of a long series of
   alternating attempts at generalization and at simplification.  It is
   intended to be at this stage complete enough to permit compatible of
   independent implementations, except for DHCP option formats are not
   specified yet.

   Being new, the specification is likely to have remaining clumsiness
   and even, the Devil being in details, to be bugged.  Corrections and
   improvements are expected to be necessary after discussions and
   further work.

   Implementation of a subset of this specification is under way at
   Telecom Bretagne, in view of a first experimentation.


2.  Example Scenarios

   To mitigate consequences of the IPv4 address shortage during the
   transition-to-IPv6 period, diverse solutions have being studied for
   different scenarios: [TransFrmwk] and [DSlite] are based on ISP
   supported NATs (CGNs); [PRR] and [A+P] make CGNs less necessary for
   various hub and spoke configurations and are based on dynamic
   reservation of port ranges (i.e. with stateful mappings).

Internet-Draft           Mesh Softwire with SAM             October 2009


   In the two chosen SAM scenarios below, a complementary approach to
   the IPv4 address shortage problem is described.  On various mesh
   softwire topologies, they support port-extended IPv4 addresses, with
   statelessly reserved port prefixes.  For legacy hosts that don't
   support SAM, these scenarios also include NAT-based dynamic address
   sharing.

   SAM's applicability is much larger than described with these two
   scenarios, but they are chosen to show the potential of stateless
   solution for mesh topologies to solve the IPv4 address shortage
   problem in some typical scenarios.

2.1.  A small ISP lacking enough global IPv4 addresses

   Figure 1 shows the configuration of this first scenario.

   The considered small ISP offers native IPv6 to its customers.
   Because it has a /32 IPv6 prefix, and assigns /48s to its customers,
   this ISP can support up to 64K customers.  Now, due to the IPv4
   address shortage, it has only a /20 IPv4 prefix, which means a
   maximum of 4K global IPv4 addresses, not enough to assign one to each
   customer.  IPv4 address need therefore to be shared, either
   dynamically for an optimized multiplexing efficiency, or statically
   so that assigned addresses and ports can be advertised outside,
   typically for server or peer-to-peer applications that need incoming
   connections.

   For legacy hosts that support only IPv4, the ISP operates a CGN that
   works as an IPv4 to IPv4 NAT (NAT44), and also assigns to its
   customers private IPv4 addresses 10.0.0.0/8 [RFC1918].  These
   addresses are obtained by CEs in DHCP [RFC2131].

   In this scenario, the ISP assign to its CGN ports 0 to 32K - 1 of all
   its IPv4 addresses, and reserves ports 32K to 64K - 1 of the same
   addresses for the port-extended IPv4 addresses.

   With SAM, in a way that will be explained in subsequent sections and
   detailed in Section 2.1, dual-stack CEs can then each obtain a shared
   global IPv4 address with 2K reserved ports (in addition to the
   possibility to use the CGN like any IPv4-capable CE).

   Each CE has total freedom to use its reserved ports ports its own

   way, and can take advantage of the end-to-end Internet transparency
   they make possible.  In the scenario of the next section, we describe
   one particular way way to use them in a customer site.

2.2.  A small customer site having only a port-restricted IPv4 address

   Figure 2 shows the configuration of this second scenario which can be
   seen as a continuation of the previous one, this time in a customer
   site.

   The considered site is that of a residential customer, or that of a
   small office/home office, where the number of hosts is below 16.
   Only one LAN is deployed (possibly with bridges between different
   physical media like copper wires, Wifi, or power-lines).  The CE
   router and some hosts supports SAM.

   For legacy hosts that are IPv4-only, the CE router supports a DHCP
   server which assigns private IPv4 addresses in the 192.168.0.0/24
   range, and supports a NAT44.  This NAT uses ports 4K to 64K - 1 on
   the private-IPv4 address 10.0.x.x of the site.  It also uses the
   lower half of the 1K reserved ports on the global IPv4 address of the
   site.  With these, it can assign ports to port forwarding, possibly
   with a dynamic reservation protocol such as NAT-PMP or UPnP.

   In addition to possibilities of other hosts, SAM-capable hosts are
   automatically assigned /52 IPv6 prefixes.  They they may use them
   freely, for example to run a small LANs behind them, e.g. in
   Bluetooth, and offer global IPv6 addresses on these LANs.

   In IPv4, each SAM-capable host is automatically assigned 32 of the
   reserved ports of the site, to be used with the assigned global IPv4
   address.  It can use it its own way, in particular to advertise ports
   on which server and peer-to peer applications are reachable, and/or
   to further distribute these reserved ports on a LAN behind it.  Note
   that for outgoing connections to IPv4-only servers whose protocols
   are known to traverse NATs without problem, e.g. for Web requests
   (remote port 80) and DNS queries (remote port 53), the private IPv4
   address with its 64K ports can be used.  This leaves more reserved
   ports for applications that may have problems with NATs.

   Note that, in the case of the DNS, a known advantage of traversing
   NATs is that used external ports are less predictable, which is a
   good precaution to prevent the possible DNS attack identified by Dan
   Kaminsky [DnsAttack].

3.  SAM terminology

   In the SAM model, illustrated in Figure 3, SAM functional modules are
   located in "border nodes" of the SAM "interior" routing domain (or
   SAM domain for short).  These modules encapsulate packets they
   receive from "exterior" domains, and forward them across the SAM

   An endpoint locator can be just a global-IPv4 or global-IPv6 address,
   or in a domain where there are not enough global IPv4 addresses, an
   address plus a port number.  In these latter domains, endpoints exist
   only for connections that use ports (TCP, UDP, DCCP, SCTP) and for
   ICMP error messages that contain headers of packets of such

   connections.

   If a SAM functional module (or just "a SAM" for short) is assigned at
   its exterior interface one or several "received" prefixes, this side
   of the SAM domain is called one of its "provider-sides" (in simple
   scenarios, there is typically only one)

   If, conversely, a SAM functional module delegates at its exterior
   interface some prefixes, this exterior side is called one of its
   "consumer-sides", and these prefixes are called "sub-delegated
   prefixes" (they are derived from the received prefixes of the SAM
   domain by appending to them the a short ID which identifies this SAM
   in the domain).

   Received and sub-delegated prefixes, which are prefixes of endpoint
   locators, can be port-extended (in IPv6 as well as in IPv4 for
   generality, and to permit to deploy IPv6 LANs behind hosts that have
   obtained IPv6 addresses but no prefixes).


4.  SAM functional sub-modules and their parameters

   Sub-modules of customer-side SAMs and of provider-side SAMs are shown
   in Figure 4.

   A customer-side SAM has a DHCP client to obtain SAM parameters of its
   domain.  DHCPv6 is used if IPv6 interior addresses are available,
   IPv4 DHCP otherwise.

   The SAM stateless autoconfiguration sub-module of a customer-side SAM
   is in charge of building its SAM interior address.  This address
   conforms to the current SAM interior address format of the SAM
   domain, received in DHCP. (if two such formats are received, one of
   them must be in the deprecated state).  This format is such that the
   short ID of a SAM, which identifies it in its SAM domain with a
   number of bits typically smaller than that of a full address, can be
   derived from the interior address of this SAM.  In IPv4, the
   autoconfiguration is based on [RFC3927], extended to support
   addresses that are not only link-local.

   The SAM map&encap sub-module is present in all SAMs, customer-sides
   and provider-sides.  It is in charge of checking that exterior source
   and destination locators in packets it receives on either of its
   interfaces are consistent with parameters of the traversed SAM, and
   checking in packets received from the interior that source and
   destination interior addresses of encapsulating packets are
   consistent with exterior source and destination addresses of
   encapsulated packets.  If these checks don't fail, packets are

   encapsulated as specified in [RFC4213] in the exterior-to-interior
   direction, and are decapsulated in the interior-to-exterior
   direction.

   The DHCP server sub-module is, at least as far as SAM is concerned,
   stateless (it doesn't need to maintain states about customer-side
   SAMs).  It is in charge of transmitting SAM parameters of the SAM
   domain to customer-side SAMs that query it.  These parameters are
   those that have been collected by the SAM-parameter gatherer sub-
   module.

   The SAM-parameter gatherer sub-module makes a synthesis of:

   o  parameters that are received for the exterior interface of the
      SAM, i.e. delegated prefixes;

   o  parameters that are administratively configured for this SAM, i.e.
      formats of SAM interior addresses and, in case of multi-homing,
      the list of interior addresses of other provider-side SAMs;

   o  parameters that are obtained by the DHCP multiple client sub-
      module.

   The SAM-parameter gatherer module queries stateless DHCP servers of
   other provider-side SAMs, and merges them.  It checks that interior-
   address formats are consistent (identical if they have the same
   format ID).

   All SAM functions being stateless, each SAM can be duplicated to
   sustain traffic loads that exceed a single processor capacity.  All
   instances must have the same SAM interior address, used as an anycast
   address.

5.  Mapping from SAM Interior Addresses to SAM short IDs

   A key feature of SAM is that, given an interior-address format, there
   is a 1:1 correspondence between the interior address of a SAM and its
   short ID.

   An interior-address format has the following sub-parameters:

   o  A "format ID".  If the SAM domain has several interior-address
      formats, this ID in its interior addresses and in its short IDs.
      If two format IDs have different lengths, they must not be
      overlapping prefixes: for example, 01 and 011 are not permitted to
      coexist, while 0, 100, 1O1, 110, 1110, and 1111 may coexist.

   o  A constant prefix "C".  In SAM domains that use private address
      spaces, it can be for example 10.0.0.0/8 in IPv4 [RFC1918], or a
      /48 prefix randomly selected for Unique Local IPv6 addresses in
      the SAM domain (ULAs of [RFC5375]).  If specified to be so, it can
      also be one of the received prefixes of the SAM domain.  In this
      case the interior address space is a global address space, and
      tunnels are established only for addresses that don't start with
      this particular prefix.

   o  The length "s" of subnet IDs.  If a SAM domain that has several
      links with different subnet prefixes, bits that, after the
      constant prefix, distinguish these subnets are called the "subnet
      ID".  In a site with only one link, subnet IDs are not needed and
      s can be 0.

   o  The length "h" of "host IDs".  In a SAM interior address, the host
      ID is in the lower part of the address.  Two consumer SAMs that
      are on a common link must have different host IDs.

5.1.  IPv6 Interior Addresses

   Figure 5 shows how the 1:1 correspondence between SAM interior
   address and short ID works for IPv6 interior addresses.

   A SAM tag is necessary to distinguish SAM interior addresses from
   addresses of legacy IPv6 nodes that are on the same link.  It needs
   for this to have the two lower bits in the 9th octet of the address
   different from all currently specified IPv6 addresses, i.e. these "u"
   and "g" bits must be both set to 1 [RFC4291].  Other bits of this
   octet are proposed to be all set to 1 to keep an escape mechanism for
   future new IPv6 address formats.

5.2.  IPv4 Interior Addresses

   Figure 6 shows how the 1:1 correspondence between SAM interior
   address and short ID works for IPv4 interior addresses.

   IPv4 should be used for SAM interior addresses only in cases SAM
   domains where IPv6 is not directly routed.  In these addresses, there
   is not, like in IPv6, a place to put the format ID without
   interfering with the place of subnet IDs.  If there is only one link,
   s must be 0 and the format ID field can be used to identify several
   host ID lengths.  If there are several links, there must be only one
   format, with unique values of s and h.

6.  Mappings between SAM Prefixes and Raw Prefixes

   An important feature of SAM is that the free hierarchical structure
   of addresses, introduced in IPv4 with CIDR [RFC1519], is extended.
   In IPv4, where it currently it applies to the 32 bits of IPv4
   addresses, it is extended to the 48 bits of port extended IPv4
   addresses.  In IPv6, it is extended from it's current 64 bits of
   subnet prefixes to the full 128 bits of IPv6 addresses, and even to
   the 144 bits of port-extended IPv6 addresses.

   Some precautions are however necessary to respect existing format
   constraints on port numbers and on IPv6 addresses:

   o  Port numbers whose prefixes are used as address extensions must
      not belong to the well-known port range 0-1023, and even to the
      0-4095 range reported to be avoided by Windows for dynamically
      assigned ports (otherwise firewalls at either end of transport
      connections could interfere).  For this reason, ports whose
      prefixes are used for address extension have their first bit
      always equal to 1.

   o  In IPv6, there has been a debate about the possibility to freely
      extend hierarchical prefixes beyond 64 bits, with for this a
      relaxation of the constraint on u and g bit values in the two
      lower bits of the 9th octet.  It now appears that this should be
      avoided for at least one reason: the protection against routing-
      loop attacks that have been found to be possible possible with
      some ISATAP routers and 6to4 relay routers (a debate on the v6ops
      mailing list was started on July 16 2009 by Gabi Nakibly on this
      subject).

                                 Figure 7

   To deal with these constraint, a distinction is made between "SAM
   prefixes", and "raw prefixes".

   SAM prefixes may span all bits of addresses and port numbers, but
   have some fixed fields, with in IPv4 the 33rd bit set to 1, and in
   IPv6 the 9th octet set to 0xFF.

   Raw prefixes are fully hierarchical like in CIDR, with all bit having
   any values, but with lengths smaller than those of SAM prefixes, in
   IPv4 by one bit, and in IPv6 by 8 bits.

7.  Derivation of  Sub-delegated prefixes from Short IDs and Received
    Prefixes

   Sub-delegated prefixes are built in each SAM domain according to the
   classical CIDR principle, where each domain in the hierarchy adds its
   interior ID to its received delegated prefix(es), except that this
   principle applies rigorously to raw prefixes rather than to SAM
   prefixes themselves.

   Figure 9 shows how sub-delegated prefixes are built, in customer-side
   SAMs, using mappings of the Section 6 between SAML prefixes and raw
   prefixes.

8.  Mapping from Source and Destination Endpoint Locators to Source and
    Destination Interior Addresses

8.1.  Encapsulation Function

   In the encapsulation function of a SAM, the following rules govern
   how source and destination exterior locators, received on the SAM
   exterior interface, are mapped into the source and destination
   addresses to be placed in the encapsulating packet:

   1.  The source locator MUST NOT match any of delegated prefix of the
       SAM, if any.

   2.  If the SAM has no delegated prefix, the source locator MUST match
       one of its sub-delegated prefixes (it MUST have at least one).

   3.  If the SAM has sub-delegated prefixes, the destination locator
       MUST NOT match any of them.

   4.  If the destination locator matches one of the received prefixes,
       a short ID MUST be extractible from it, in bits that follow this
       prefix, according to parameters of one of the interior address
       formats.  The DESTINATION INTERIOR ADDRESS is then derived from
       this format and this short ID.

   5.  If the destination locator doesn't match any of the received
       prefixes, then the source locator MUST match one of the sub-
       delegated prefixes of the SAM.  The DESTINATION INTERIOR ADDRESS
       is then that of a parent SAM that has the delegated prefix from
       which this sub-delegated prefix has been derived.

   6.  Provided all previous conditions have been verified, the SOURCE
       INTERIOR ADDRESS is that of the SAM.

8.2.  Decapsulation Function

   In the decapsulation function of a SAM, the following are the rules
   to be checked to ensure that, in a packet received on its interior
   interface, source and destination addresses of the encapsulating
   packet and source and destination locators of the encapsulated packet
   are consistent, both among themselves and with parameters of the SAM:

   1.  The destination locator MUST NOT match any of delegated prefix of
       the SAM, if any.

   2.  If the SAM has no delegated prefix, the destination locator MUST
       match one of its sub-delegated prefixes (it MUST have at least
       one).

Internet-Draft           Mesh Softwire with SAM             October 2009


   3.  If the SAM has sub-delegated prefixes, the source locator MUST
       NOT match any of them.

   4.  If the source locator matches one of the received prefixes, a
       short ID MUST be extractible from it, in bits that follow this
       prefix, according to parameters of one of the interior address
       formats, and the source interior address MUST be that which is
       derived from this format and this short ID.

   5.  If the source locator doesn't match any of the received prefixes,
       then the destination locator MUST match one of the sub-delegated
       prefixes of the SAM, and the source interior address MUST be that
       of a parent SAM that has the delegated prefix from which this
       sub-delegated prefix has been derived.

   6.  The destination interior address MUST be that of this SAM.


9.  Detailed Prefixes for the Example Scenarios

   We now return to the two example scenarios of Section 2 to show, with
   detailed address and prefix values, how the SAM mechanisms can
   deliver what was claimed.

   Figure 10 and Figure 11 respectively deal with the small ISP scenario
   of Section 2.1 and with the customer site scenario of Section 2.2.

10.  Applicability to other scenarios

   Scenarios that can take advantage of such a simple mechanism as SAM
   are so numerous that listing them is well beyond the scope of this
   document.

   Note however that SAM can be used in ISP networks that route
   exclusively in IPv6, as described in particular in [IVI].  With SAM,
   IPv4 end-to-end transparency in particular can be offered to
   customers across the IPv6-only ISP domain, thanks to the
   encapsulation of IPv4 packets in IPv6 packets.  A typical scenario
   would combine SAM with translation solutions, which remain necessary
   for hosts that don't support SAM.


11.  Security considerations

   Provided all address checks of Section 8 are performed, as required
   by this specification, no new security risk has been identified so
   far.


12.  IANA Considerations

   If and when detailed formats are agreed on for SAM-specific DHCP
   options, they will have to be submitted to IANA.

   Also, the SAM tag in the 9th octet of IPv6 addresses, used to
   distinguish SAM addresses from other IPv6 addresses, should in due
   time be registered by IANA.


13.  Acknowledgments

   This specification is mostly the result of a personal effort of the
   author, in continuation to his work that led to the rapid deployment
   of native IPv6 by Iliad/Free [Free's IPv6 in 2007].  High recognition
   is however due to Mark Townsley.  He listened to intermediate stage
   presentations, provided useful reactions, and became a convincing an
   advocate in favor of a Cisco Research Grant to be allocated to
   Telecom Bretagne for a test of a subset of SAM.  Special thanks are
   due to Laurent Toutain who, having seen the potential of SAM, decided
   to start an experiment with his team at Telecom Bretagne.
   Acknowledgments are also due to Dave Thaler who made a precious
   detailed review of the previous version.  Beyond this, the open
   discussion environment of IETF in general has been a continuous
   encouragement.
