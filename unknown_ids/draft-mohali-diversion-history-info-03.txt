Abstract

   Diversion header is not standardized but widely used to convey
   diverting information in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling.
   This informational document proposes a way to make interwork call
   diversion information contained in a Diversion header with a History-
   Info header.  In addition, an interworking policy is proposed to
   manage the headers coexistence.
   The History-Info header is described in [RFC4244]. 
   Since the Diversion header is used in many existing networks
   implementations for transport of diversion informationand its
   interworking with standardized solutions is not obvious, an
   interworking recommendation is needed.

Internet-Draft     Mapping Diversion and History-Info         April 2009


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   For some network services (eg.  Voicemail, IVR or automatic call
   distribution), it is necessary for the called SIP user agent to
   identify from whom and why the session was diverted.  In order to be
   used by various service providers or applications, redirection
   information needs to pass through the network.
   This is possible with two different SIP headers: History-Info
   header[RFC4244] and Diversion header which are both able to transport
   diversion information in SIP signaling.  Because of the current
   wildely use of Diversion header even if it is not a standard, it is
   necessary to have a guideline to make this header interwork with
   History-Info header.
   This document provides a mechanism of translation between the
   Diversion header and the History-Info header.

1.2.  Background

   The History-Info header [RFC4244] and a the URI extension (including
   Voicemail URI)[RFC4458] are recommended by IETF to convey redirection
   information.  They are also recommended in the "Communication
   Diversion (CDIV) service" 3GPP specification[TS_24.604].

   At first, the Diversion header was described in
   [draft-levy-sip-diversion-08], which is today discarded.
   Note to the RFC-Editor: The reference to this draft should be
   replaced by the Historic RFC reference (work in progress).
   This header contains the list of the diverting user(s) with
   associated information and the expired draft could explain why many
   implementations are based on this header.  It has been chosen to
   standardized the History-Info header because it could transport
   "request history" information which allows the receiving application
   to determine hints about how and why the session arrived at the
   application/user.  As History-Info header information is larger than
   call diversion information, it is realy important to be sure of not
   loosing information and be able to extract the good data with help of
   the retargeting cause URI parameter described in [RFC4458] for the
   transport of the diversion reason.

   Those headers have different syntaxes described below.  Note that the
   main difference is that the History-Info header is a chronological
   writing header whereas the Diversion header is the opposite (i.e. the
   first diversion entry read correspond to the last diverting user).

   The Appendix provides an interworking guideline between the Diversion
   header and the Voicemail URI which is an other way to convey

   diversion information described in [RFC4458].


2.  Problem Statement

2.1.  Interworking need

   The Diversion header is used for recording communication diversion
   information which could be useful to downstream network entities.
   Today, this SIP header is implemented by several manufacturers and
   deployed in several networks.

   The History-Info header is standardized, among other needs, for the
   transportation of diversion information.

   As both are answering to call forwarding needs, according to the one
   created or completed in one side and the one interpreted in the other
   side, diverting information could be mixed-up if they are both
   present in the INVITE request.  So, Diversion and History-Info
   headers MUST NOT independently coexist for the session signalling.

   For the transportation of consistent diversion information
   downstream, it is necessary to make the two headers interwork.
   Interworking between the Diversion header and the History-Info header
   is presented in sections 5 and 6.  As the interworking is not obvious
   and the coexistence not easy according the use cases, is it proposed
   a policy to manage the headers interaction.


2.2.  Interworking recommendations

   Interworking function:
   In a normal case, the network topology assumption is that the
   interworking described in this document should be performed by a
   specific SIP border device which by configuration is aware that it is
   at the border between two regions, one using History-Info header and
   one using Diversion header.

   History-Info header is a standardized solution, so a network using
   the Diversion header MUST be able to provide information at the good
   format to a network using the History-Info header.  In this case, to
   avoid both headers coexistence it is recommended as often as possible
   to replace the Diversion header per the History-Info header in the
   INVITE request during the interworking.

   Since, the History-Info header has a boarder scope than the Diversion
   header and could be used for other services than call diversion ; in
   addition to trace call diversion information, it is acting as a

   session history and could store all successive R-URI values.
   Consequently, even if it should be better to remove the History-Info
   header after the Diversion header has been created to avoid any
   confusion; if the History-Info header contains supplementary (no-
   diversion) information it MUST be remained as it is and passed
   transparently in this network.  Furthermore, it could be possible to
   have History-Info headers that do not have values that can be mapped
   into the Diversion header.  In this case, no interworking with
   Diversion header should be performed and implementations will have to
   decide what to do.  This point is out of this document scope.
   As a conclusion, if some information could be lost but needed
   downstream or according the header used per network elements, it is
   necessary to have a local policy to find the best way to keep
   information up to the terminating user agent.
   This section describes the basic and commonly use case.  More unusual
   interworking cases, like situation where persistence of both headers
   is needed, are described in section 7.5.

   a.  SIP network/terminal using Diversion to SIP network/terminal
   using History-Info header:

   When the Diversion header is used to create a History-Info header,
   the Diversion header MUST be removed in the outgoing INVITE.  It is
   considered that all information present in the Diversion header is
   transferred in the History-Info header.

   If a History-Info header is present in the incoming INVITE (in
   addition to Diversion header), the Diversion header and History-Info
   header present MUST be mixed and only the diversion information not
   yet present in the History-Info header MUST be inserted as a last
   entry (more recent) in the existing History-Info header as
   recommended in [RFC4244].
   As an example, this could be the case of an INVITE coming from a
   network_2 using Diversion header but before passed through a
   network_1 using History-Info header (or the network_2 uses History-
   Info header to transport successive URI information) and going to a
   network_3 using History-Info header.

|       |       |<sip:userC>; cause=302; index=1.1.1  |       |        |
   In this case, the incoming INVITE contains a Diversion header and a
   History-Info header.  So that, it is necessary to create, for
   network_3, a single History-Info header gathering existing
   information in the History-Info header received and those present in
   the Diversion header.  Then network_3 could use call forwarding
   information that are present in a single header and add its own
   diversion information if necessary.

   Note: if a network is not able either to use only one header each
   time, or to maintain both headers up to date, the chronological order
   could not be certified.

   Note: it is not possible to have only Diversion header when the
   History-Info header contains more than call diversion information.
   If previous policy recommendations are applied, the chronological
   order is respected as Diversion entries are inserted at the end of
   the History-Info header taking into account the Diversion internal
   chronology.

   b.  SIP network/terminal using History-Info header to SIP network/
   terminal using Diversion header:

   When the History-Info header is interpreted to create a Diversion
   header, some precautions MUST be taken.
   If the History-Info header contains only communication diversion



Mohali, et al.           Expires October 3, 2009                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     Mapping Diversion and History-Info         April 2009


   information, then it MUST be suppressed after the interworking.
   If the History-Info header contains other information, then only the
   information of concern to the diverting user MUST be used to create
   entries in the Diversion header and the History-Info header MUST be
   kept as received in the INVITE forwarded downstream.

   Note: The History-Info header could be used for other reasons than
   CDIV services, for example by a service which need to know if a
   specific AS had yet been invoked in the signalling path.  If the call
   is after forwarded to a network using History-Info header, it would
   be better to not loose history information due to passing though the
   network which only support Diversion header.  A recommended solution
   MUST NOT disrupt the standard behaviour and networks which not
   implement History-Info header MUST be transparent to an incoming
   History-Info header.

   If a Diversion header is already present in the incoming INVITE (in
   addition to History-Info header), only diversion information present
   in the History-Info header but not in the Diversion header MUST be
   inserted from the last entry (more recent) into the existing
   Diversion header as recommended in the Diversion draft
   [draft-levy-sip-diversion-08].
   Note to the RFC-Editor: The reference to this draft should be
   replaced by the Historic RFC reference (work in progress).
   Note that the chronological order could not be certified.  If
   previous policy recommendations are respected, this case SHOULD NOT
   happen.


   Forking case:
   The History-Info header enables the recording of sequential forking
   for the same served-user.  During a interworking from the History-
   Info header to Diversion header, the History-Info entries containing
   a forking situation (with an incremented "index" parameter) could be
   either mapped for each entry with a call forwarding "cause"
   parameter, the interworking entity could choose to create only one
   Diversion entry or to not apply the interworking.  The choice could
   be done according a local policy.

   The same logic is applied for an interworking with Voicemail URI (see
   the Appendix).


3.  Headers syntaxes reminder

3.1.  History-Info header syntax

   History-Info = "History-Info" HCOLON hi-entry *(COMMA hi-entry)
   hi-entry = hi-targeted-to-uri *( SEMI hi-param )
   hi-targeted-to-uri= name-addr
   hi-param = hi-index / hi-extension
   hi-index = "index" EQUAL 1*DIGIT *(DOT 1*DIGIT)
   hi-extension = generic-param


   The History-Info header is specified in [RFC4244].  The top-most
   History-Info entry (first in the list) corresponds to the oldest
   history information.  Amongst information contained in the hi-entry
   list, it could be introduced diversion information with a specific
   cause URI parameter expressing the diversion reason.  This optional
   cause URI parameter is defined in [RFC4458] with the following
   syntax: cause-param = "cause" EQUAL Status-Code.  This parameter is
   also named cause-param, and should be inserted in the History-Info
   entry (URI) of the diverted-to user in case of call diversion.  The
   cause values used in the cause-param for the diverting reason are
   listed in the RFC and because it is a parameter dedicated to call
   forwarding service, its presence is used to determine that a hi-entry
   is a diverting user.  More exactly, each diverting user is located in
   the hi-entry before the one containing a cause-param with cause value
   as listed in RFC 4458.
   Moreover, the Reason header defined in [RFC3326]SHOULD be escaped in
   the hi-entry of the diverting user when the call diversion is due to
   a SIP response received.  The Reason header contains a cause
   parameter set to the true SIP response code received (Status-Code).
   This header parameter is mentionned in RFC4244.
   Therefore, in case of call diversion due to a SIP response, both
   cause parameters should be used.  The complexity is that thoses
   parameters could be used at the same time in the History-Info header
   but not in the same hi-entry and not with the same meaning.  Only the
   cause-param is dedicated to call diversion service.

   [RFC4458]also defines the 'target' URI parameter which could be
   inserted in a R-URI and consequently in the hi-targeted-to-uri.  This
   parameter is used to keep the diverting user address in the
   downstream INVITE request espacially in Voicemail URI implementation.
   As this information is yet present in the hi-entries, the 'target'
   URI parameter is not taken into account regarding the interworking
   with the Diversion header.  On the other hand, from the Diversion
   header, it could be possible to create the 'target' URI parameter in
   the hi-entries and/or in the R-URI but this possibility is on local
   policies responsabilty and not described in this document (as this
   case is not taken into account in the 3GPP interworking
   specification[TS_29.163]).

Internet-Draft     Mapping Diversion and History-Info         April 2009


   A Privacy header as defined in [RFC3323] could also be included in
   hi-entries with the 'history' value defined in the RFC4244.

   The index parameter is a string of digits, separated by dots to
   indicate the number of forward hops and retargets. first one is

   Note: A history entry could contain the "gr" parameter.  Regardless
   the rules concerning "gr" parameter defined in [TS_24.604] which must
   be applied, this parameter has no impact on the mapping and must only
   be copied with the served user address.


   Example:

   History-Info:
   <sip: diverting_user1_addr?Privacy=none?Reason=SIP%3Bcause%
   3D302>;index=1,
   <sip: diverting_user2_addr;cause=480?Privacy=history>;index=1.1,
   <sip:last_diversion_target;cause=486>; index=1.1.1,


   Policy concerning "histinfo" option tag in Supported header:
   According to [RFC4244], a proxy that receives a Request with the
   "histinfo" option tag in the Supported header should return captured
   History-Info in subsequent, provisional and final responses to the
   Request.  The behaviour depend whether the local policy support the
   capture of History-Info or not.



3.2.  Diversion header syntax

   The current document is not written to define again the Diversion
   header and its use but to be shure that the syntax is interpreted in
   the same way by everyone.  So that, the Diversion syntax is here a
   little changed to correspond to the current ABNF[RFC4234]:

   Diversion = "Diversion" HCOLON diversion-params *(COMMA diversion-
   params)
   diversion-params = name-addr *(SEMI (diversion-reason / diversion-
   counter / diversion-limit / diversion-privacy / diversion-screen /
   diversion-extension))
   diversion-reason = "reason" EQUAL ("unknown" / "user-busy" / "no-
   answer" / "unavailable" / "unconditional" / "time-of-day" / "do-not-
   disturb" / "deflection" / "follow-me" / "out-of-service" / "away" /
   token / quoted-string)
   diversion-counter = "counter" EQUAL 1*2DIGIT
   diversion-limit = "limit" EQUAL 1*2DIGIT

Internet-Draft     Mapping Diversion and History-Info         April 2009


   diversion-privacy = "privacy" EQUAL ("full" / "name" / "uri" / "off"
   / token / quoted-string)
   diversion-screen = "screen" EQUAL ("yes" / "no" / token / quoted-
   string)
   diversion-extension = token [EQUAL (token / quoted-string)]


   Note: The Diversion header could be used in the comma-separated
   format as described below and in a header-separated format.  Both
   formats could be combined a received INVITE as RECOMMENDED in
   [RFC3261].


   Example:

   Diversion:
   diverting_user2_addr; reason="user-busy"; counter=1; privacy=full,
   diverting_user1_addr; reason="unconditional"; counter=1; privacy=off




4.  Headers in SIP Method

   You can find here a reminder of History-Info header field and
   Diversion header field in relation to methods.  As those headers do
   not have the same capabilities, it is necessary to clarify the
   interworking.

   Use of History-Info header field:

   Header field where proxy ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG MSG
   ------------ ----- ----- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
   History-Info        amdr   -   -   -  o   o   o   o
                            SUB NOT REF INF UPD PRA PUB
                            --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
   History-Info        amdr o    o   o   -   -   -   o


   Use of Diversion header field:

   Header field where  enc. e-e ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG
   ------------ ----- ----- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
   Diversion      R          h   -   -   -   o   -   -
   Diversion     3xx         h   -   -   -   o   -   -

   The recommended interworking presented in this document SHOULD apply
   only for INVITE requests.

Internet-Draft     Mapping Diversion and History-Info         April 2009


   In 3xx responses, both headers could be present.
   When a proxy wants to interwork with a network supporting the other
   header field, it SHOULD apply the interworking between Diversion
   header and History-Info header in the 3xx response.
   When a recursing proxy redirects an initial INVITE after receiving a
   3xx response, it SHOULD add as a last entry either a Diversion header
   or History-Info header (according to its capabilities) in the
   forwarded INVITE.  Local policies could apply to send the received
   header in the next INVITE or not.

   Other messages where History-Info could be present are not used for
   the Call Forwarding service and SHOULD NOT be changed into Diversion
   header.  The destination network MUST be transparent the received
   History-Info header.
   Note : the following mapping is inspired from the ISUP to SIP
   interworking described in. [TS_29.163]


5.  Diversion header to History-Info header

   The following text is valid only if no History-Info is present in the
   INVITE request.  If at least one History-Info header is present, the
   interworking function shall adapt its behaviour to respect the
   chronological order.  See section 2.2.
   For N Diversion entries N+1 History-Info entries MUST be created.  To
   create the History-Info entries in the same order than during a
   session establishment, the Diversion entries MUST be mapped from the
   bottom-most until the top-most.  Each Diversion entry shall be mapped
   into a History-Info entry.  An additional (the last one) History-Info
   entry must be created wiht the diverted-to party address presents in
   the R-URI of the received INVITE, The mapping is described below.

   The first entry created in the History-Info header contains:

      - a hi-target-to-uri with the name-addr parameter of the bottom-
      most Diversion header

      - if a privacy parameter is present in the bottom-most Diversion
      entry, then a Privacy header could be escaped in the History-Info
      header as described bellow,

      - an index set to 1.


   For each following Diversion entry (from bottom to top), the History-
   info entries are created as following (from top to bottom):

      - if a privacy parameter is present in the top-most Diversion
      entry, then a Privacy header could be escaped in the History-Info
      header as described above,

      - an index set to the previous created index and incremented with
      ".1"

   Note: For other optional Diversion parameters, there is no
   recommendation.

   Note: For values of the diversion-reason values which are mapped with
   a recommended default value, it could also be possible to choose an
   other value.  The cause-param URI parameter offers less possible
   values than the diversion-reason parameter.  However, it has been
   considered that cause-param values list was sufficient to implement
   CDIV service as defined in 3GPP as it cover a large portion of cases.

   Note : The Diversion header could contain a Tel:URI in the name-addr
   parameter but it seems to not be possible to have a Tel:URI in the
   History-Info header.  RFC3261 gives an indication as to the mapping
   between sip: and tel: URIs but in this particular case it is
   difficult to assign a valid hostport as the diversion has occurred in
   a previous network and a valid hostport is difficult to determine.
   So, it is suggested that in case of Tel:URI in the Diversion header,
   the History-Info header should be created with a SIP URI with
   user=phone.

   Note: The Diversion header allows the carrying of a counter which had
   retained the information about the number of redirections which have
   occurred.  History-Info does not have an equivalent because to trace
   and count diversion occurred it is necessary to count cause parameter
   containing a value associated to a call diversion.  To read the index
   value is not enough.  With the use of the "placeholder" entry the
   History-info header entries could reflect the real number of
   diversion occurred.  Example of placeholder entry in the History-Info
   header: <sip:unknown@unknown.invalid;cause=404>;index=1.1 For a
   placeholder History entry the value "404" shall be taken.

   Concerning local policies recommendations about headers coexistence
   in the INVITE request, see sections 2.2 and 7.5.


6.  History-Info header to Diversion header

   To create the Diversion entries in the same order than during a
   session establishment, the History-Info entries MUST be mapped from
   the top-most until the bottom-most.  The first History-Info header
   entry selected will be mapped into the last Diversion header entry

   and so on.  One Diversion header entry MUST be created for each
   History-Info entry with a cause-param reflecting a diverting reason
   as listed in the [RFC4458].

   In this case, the History-Info header MUST be mapped into the
   Diversion header as following:

   * Note: The IWF is an interworking function which could be a stand-alone
     equipment not defined in this draft (it could be a proxy).

7.4.  Additional interworking Cases

   Even if for particular cases in which both headers could coexist it
   should be the network local policy responsibility to make it work
   together, here are described some situations and some recommendations
   on the behaviour to follow.

   In the case where there is one network which includes different
   nodes, some of which support Diversion header and some which support
   History-info header, the problem is when any node handling a message
   does not know which node will next handle the message.  This case can
   occur when the network has new and old nodes, the older ones using
   Diversion header and the more recent History-Info header.
   While a network replacement may be occurring there will be a time
   when both nodes exist in the network.  If the different nodes are
   being used to support different subscriber types due to different
   node capabilities then the problem is more important.  In this case
   there is a need to pass both History-Info header and Diversion header
   within the network core.
   These headers need to be equivalent to ensure that whatever node
   receives the message the correct diversion information is received.
   This requires that whichever header is received there is a
   requirement to be able to compare the headers and to convert the

   headers.  Depending upon node capability then it may be possible to
   make assumptions as to how this is handled.
   If it is known that the older Diversion header supporting nodes do
   not pass on any received History-Info header then the interworking
   becomes easier.  If a message is received with only Diversion headers
   then it has originated from an 'old' node.  The equivalent History-
   Info entries can be created and these can then be passed as well as
   the Diversion header.
   If the node creates a new History-Info header for a call diversion,
   then an additional Diversion header must be created.
   If the next node is an 'old' node then the Diversion header will be
   used by that node and the History-Info entries will be removed from
   the message when it is passed on.
   If the next node is a new node then the presence of both Diversion
   header and History-Info header means that interworking has already
   occurred and the Diversion and History-Info entries must be
   considered equivalent.
   If both nodes pass on both History-Info header and Diversion header
   but only actively use one, then both types of node need to perform
   the interworking and must maintain equivalence between the headers.
   This will eventually result in the use of Diversion header being
   deprecated when all nodes in the network support History-Info header.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.


9.  Security Considerations

   The use of Diversion header or History-Info header require to apply
   the requested privacy and integrity asked by each diverting user or
   entity.  Without integrity, the requested privacy functions could be
   downgraded or eliminated, potentially exposing identity information.
   Without confidentiality, eavesdroppers on the network (or any
   intermediaries between the user and the privacy service) could see
   the very personal information that the user has asked the privacy
   service to obscure.  Unauthorised insertion, deletion of modification
   of those headers can provide misleading information to users and
   applications.  A SIP entity that can provide a redirection reason in
   a History-Info header or Diversion header SHOULD be able to suppress
   this in accordance with privacy requirements of the user concerned.

Appendix A.  Interworking between Diversion header and Voicemail URI

   Voicemail URI is a mechanism described in RFC4458 to provide a simple
   way to transport only one redirecting user address and the reason why
   the diversion occurred in the R-URI of the INVITE request.  This
   mechanism is mainly used for call diversion to a voicemail.


   Diversion header to Voicemail URI:

   Received:
   Diversion: userA-address;reason=user-busy;counter=1;privacy=full

   Sent (Voicemail URI created in the R-URI line of the INVITE):
   sip: voicemail@example.com;target=userA-address;cause=486 SIP/2.0

   Mapping of the Redirection Reason is the same as for History-Info
   header with a default value set to 404.
   If the Diversion header contains more than one Diversion entry, the
   choice of the redirecting user information inserted in the URI is in
   charge of the network local policy.  For example, the choice
   criterion of the redirecting information inserted in the URI could be
   the destination of forwarded INVITE request (if the voicemail serves
   this user or not).

   Note: This interworking could be done in addition to the interworking
   of the Diversion header into the History-Info header.


   Voicemail URI to Diversion header:
   In case of real Voicemail, this way of interworking should not
   happen.  However, if for any reason it occurs, it is recommended to
   do it as following:

   Received:
   INVITE sip: voicemail@example.com;\
   target=sip:+33145454500%40example.com;user=phone;\
   cause=302 SIP/2.0

   Sent in the forwarded INVITE:
