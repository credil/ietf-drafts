    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the framework, messages, and procedures for
      the Diameter Network Address and Port Translation Control Application
      (DNCA), allowing for per-endpoint control of large scale NAT/NAPT
      devices, which are put in place to cope with IPv4-address space
      completion. The DNCA allows external devices to configure and manage a
      NAT device - expanding the existing Diameter-based AAA and policy
      control capabilities with a NAT/NAPT control component. These external
      devices can be network elements in the data plane such as a Network
      Access Server (NAS), or can be more centralized control plane devices
      such as AAA-servers. DNCA establishes a context to commonly identify and
      manage endpoints on a gateway or server, and a large scale NAPT/NAT
      device. This includes, for example, the control of the total number of
      NAT-bindings allowed or the allocation of a specific NAT-binding for a
      particular endpoint. In addition, it allows large scale NAT devices to
      provide information relevant to accounting purposes.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>Internet service providers have started to deploy Network Address
      Translators (NATs) and Network Address and Port Translators (NAPTs) at
      the edge of their networks to deal with the depletion of available
      public IPv4 addresses. This document defines a Diameter application for
      providers deploying such NATs and NAPT devices. The use of a Diameter
      application allows for simple integration into the existing AAA
      environment of a provider.</t>

      <t>The Diameter NAPT Control Application (DNCA) offers the following
      capabilities:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Limit/Define the number of NAPT/NAT-bindings made available to an
          individual subscriber or end point.</t>

          <t>Support the allocation of specific NAPT/NAT-bindings. Two types
          of specific bindings can be distinguished:<list style="symbols">
              <t>Allocation of a pre-defined NAT-binding. Both the internal as
              well as the external IP-address/port pair are specified within
              the request. Some deployment cases, such as access to a
              web-server within a user&rsquo;s home network with IP-address
              and port, benefit from statically configured bindings.</t>

              <t>Allocation of an external IP-address for a given internal
              IP-address. The allocated external IP-address will be reported
              back to the requestor. In some deployment scenarios, the
              application requires immediate knowledge of the allocated
              binding for a given internal IP-address but does not control the
              allocation of the external IP-address (e.g. SIP-proxy server
              deployments).</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Define the external address-pool(s) to be used for allocating an
          external IP-address. External address-pools can either be pre-
          assigned at the NAPT/NAT, or specified within a request. If pre-
          assigned address-pools are used, a request needs to include a
          reference to identify the pool. Otherwise, the request will contain
          a description of the IP- address pool(s) to be used (e.g. list of
          IP-subnets).</t>

          <t>Accounting/Reporting: Report established bindings for a
          particular user. The collected information is used by accounting
          systems, for statistical purposes, etc.</t>

          <t>Query functionality to retrieve details about bindings on demand.
          This feature complements the previously mentioned accounting
          functionality mentioned above (see item 4). The query functionality
          complements alternative information query mechanisms such as
          SNMP-based mechanisms, if available.</t>

          <t>Common identification of a subscriber or endpoint on multiple
          network devices such as the NAPT/NAT device, the AAA server, or the
          Network Access Server (NAS). Endpoint identification is facilitated
          through a Global Endpoint ID. Endpoints are identified through a
          single or a set of classifiers such as IP address, VLAN identifier,
          or interface identifier which uniquely identify the traffic
          associated with a particular global endpoint</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document is structured as follows: Section 2 lists terminology,
      while Section 3 provides an introduction to the Diameter NAPT Control
      Application and its overall deployment framework. Sections 4 to 8 cover
      the DNCA specifics, with Section 4 describing session management,
      Section 5 the use of the Diameter base protocol, Section 6 new commands,
      Section 7 the respective AVPs used, and Section 8 accounting aspects.
      Section 9 presents an AVP occurance table. IANA and security
      considerations are addressed in Sections 10 and 11.</t>

        <t><xref target="fig-LSN-deployment"></xref> depicts the deployment
        scenario when a service provider introduces a NAT device to increase
        the efficiency of the global IPv4 address pool utilization. The
        objective is to provide the customer with connectivity to the public
        IPv4 Internet. The NAT device performs network address (and optionally
        protocol) translation, depending on whether the access network uses
        private IPv4 addresses or public IPv6 addresses, to public IPv4
        addresses. If the NAT device would be put in place without any
        endpoint awareness, the service offerings of the service provider
        would be hampered. Provisioning static NAT-bindings for particular
        endpoints, using different public IP-address pools for different set
        of endpoints (e.g. residential or business customers), as well as
        reporting on the allocated bindings on a per-endpoint basis would be
        burdensome for a service provider if the NAT device would not be aware
        of endpoints and allow for per-endpoint control and management which
        easily integrates with the already existing per-endpoint management
        infrastructure of the service provider.</t>

      <section title="Diameter NAPT Control Application Overview">
        <t>The Diameter NAT Control Application runs between a Diameter NAT
        Control Application Agent on the NAT and the Diameter NAT Control
        Application Manager. DNCA allows for per-endpoint control and
        management of a NAT. Being based on Diameter, DNCA integrates well
        with the suite of Diameter applications deployed for per-endpoint
        authentication, authorization, accounting, and policy control in
        service provider networks.</t>

        <t>DNCA offers request and answer commands to control the allowed
        number of NAT-bindings per endpoint, to request the allocation of
        specific bindings for an endpoint, to define the address pool to be
        used for an endpoint, to provide per endpoint reporting on the
        allocated NAT-bindings, as well as to provide for unique
        identification of an endpoint on both NAT, AAA-server and NAS, thus
        simplifying the correlation of accounting data streams.</t>

        <t>DNCA allows for controlling the behavior of a NAT device on a
        per-endpoint basis during initial session establishment as well as at
        later stages by providing an update procedure for already established
        sessions. Using DNCA, per-endpoint NAT-binding information can be
        retrieved either using accounting mechanisms or through an explicit
        session query to the NAT.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Deployment Scenarios For The Diameter NAPT Control Application">
        <t>Deployment dependent, the role of the Diameter NAT Control Manager
        can be fulfilled by either the NAS or by an external server such as an
        AAA-server. The two deployment scenarios are outlined in <xref
        target="fig-LSN-integrated-deployment"></xref> (&ldquo;integrated
        deployment&rdquo;) and <xref
        target="fig-LSN-autonomous-deployment"></xref> (&ldquo;autonomous
        deployment&rdquo;).</t>

        <t>Within the figures (M) denotes the network element which takes on
        the DNCA manager role. Similarly, (A) identifies the network element
        which performs the DNCA agent role.</t>

        <t>The integrated deployment approach hides the existence of the NAT
        device from external servers such as the AAA-server as much as
        possible. It is suited for environments where minimal changes to the
        existing AAA deployment are desired. The NAS, taking the role of the
        DNCA manager, is in charge of initiating and managing the session to
        the NAT device, exchanging NAT specific configuration information as
        well as handling reporting and accounting information. The NAS
        receives reporting and accounting information from NAT device. This
        way the NAS can provide for a single accounting record for the user,
        offloading external accounting systems from correlating accounting
        information received from multiple sources.</t>

        <t>An example network attachment for an integrated NAT deployment
        could be described as follows: An endpoint connects to the network,
        with the NAS being the point of attachment. After successful
        authentication, NAS receives endpoint related authorization data from
        the AAA-server. A portion of the authorization data applies to
        per-endpoint configuration on the NAS itself, another portion
        describes authorization and configuration information for NAT control
        aimed at the NAT. NAS will initiate a DNCA session to the NAT and send
        the relevant authorization and configuration information for the
        particular endpoint to the NAT device. This could comprise e.g.
        NAT-bindings which have to be pre-established for the endpoint, or
        management related configuration, such as the maximum number of
        NAT-bindings allowed for the endpoint or accounting requirements. The
        NAT device will send its per-endpoint accounting information to the
        NAS which aggregates the accounting information received form the NAT
        with its local accounting information for the endpoint into a single
        accounting stream towards the AAA-server.</t>

        <t>The autonomous deployment approach decouples user management on NAS
        and NAT device. The AAA system performing the role of the DNCA manager
        manages the connection to the NAT device, controls the per-endpoint
        configuration, and also receives accounting and reporting information
        from the NAT device. Different from the integrated deployment
        scenario, the autonomous deployment scenario does not
        &ldquo;hide&rdquo; the existence of the NAT device from the AAA
        infrastructure. Here two accounting streams are received by the
        AAA-server for one particular endpoint, one from the NAS, and one from
        the NAT device.</t>

      <t>Note that this section forward references some of the commands and
      AVPs defined for the DNCA. Please refer to <xref

      <section title="Parties Involved ">
        <t>Authorization and control models supported by this application
        include the following parties: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Diameter NAT Control Application (DNCA) agent: The DNCA agent
            is part of the Large scale NAT (NAT) device</t>

            <t>Diameter NAT Control Application (DNCA) manager</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The NAT control requesting entity is always the DNCA manager.
        Sessions will always be initiated, updated, or terminated by the DNCA
        manager. This mode of operation is sometimes also referred to as "push
        mode".</t>

        <t>DNCA manager can be NAS or AAA Server. DNCA manager will initiate a
        session with DNCA agent when it learns about the subscriber. DNCA
        manager may learn about a subscriber when it receives authentication,
        authorization or accounting request for that subscriber or by some
        other means such as on the box configuration to identify subscriber
        w.r.t IP packets.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Session Establishment">
        <t>The DNCA manager establishes a session to the DNCA agent to control
        the behavior of the NAT device. During session establishment, the DNCA
        manager will pass along configuration information to the DNCA agent.
        Session configuration information could for example comprise the
        maximum number of bindings allowed for the endpoint associated with
        this session, a set of pre-defined NAT-bindings to be established for
        this endpoint, or a description of the address pool, external
        addresses should be allocated from.</t>

        <t>The DNCA manager initiates the Diameter NAT Control session to the
        DNCA agent. The DNCA manager generates a NAT-Control Request (NCR)
        message to the DNCA agent with NC-Request-Type AVP set to
        INITIAL_REQUEST. On receipt of the NCR the DNCA agent will setup a new
        session for the endpoint associated with the endpoint classifier(s)
        contained in the NCR. The DNCA agent notifies the DNCA manager about
        successful session setup using a NAT-Control Answer (NCA) message with
        Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. <xref
        target="fig-session-establishment"></xref> shows the protocol
        interaction between the DNCA manager and the DNCA agent.</t>

        <t>The initial NAT-Control-Request can contain configuration
        information for the session which specifies the behavior of the NAT
        for the session. Configuration information which can be included
        comprises: <list style="symbols">
            <t>A list of NAT-bindings which should be pre-allocated for the
            session (e.g. in case a subscriber requires a fixed external IP-
            address/port pair for one of his applications).</t>

            <t>The maximum number of NAT bindings allowed for an endpoint.</t>

            <t>A description of the external address pool(s) to be used for
            the session.</t>

            <t>A reference to a predefined binding rule on DNCA agent that
            will be applied to the session. Such a predefined binding rule on
            DNCA agent may contain, for example, the name of the IP-address
            pool that external IP-addresses should be allocated from, maximum
            number of bindings permitted for the endpoint etc.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In certain cases, the DNCA agent may not be able to perform the
        tasks requested within the NCR. These include the following: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>If a DNCA agent receives a NCR from a DNCA manager with NC-
            Request-Type AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST that identifies an already
            existing session (i.e. DNCA manager and endpoint identifier match
            an already existing session), the DNCA agent will return NCA with
            Result-Code set to SESSION_EXISTS, and provides Session-Id of the
            existing session in Duplicate-Session-Id AVP.</t>

            <t>If a DNCA agent receives an NCR from a DNCA manager with NC-
            Request-Type AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST that matches more than one
            of the already existing sessions (i.e. DNCA manager and endpoint
            identifier match already existing sessions), the DNCA agent will
            return a NCA with Result-Code set to Insufficient-Classifiers. In
            case a DNCA manager receives a NCA that reports
            Insufficient-Classifiers, it may choose to retry establishing a
            new session using additional/more specific classifiers.</t>

            <t>If the NCR contains a binding rule not defined on the NAT, the
            DNCA agent will return a NCA with Result-Code AVP set to
            UNKNOWN_BINDING_RULE.</t>

            <t>In case the DNCA agent is unable to establish all of the
            bindings requested in the NCR, it will return a NCA with
            Result-Code set to BINDING_FAILURE. The DNCA agent (i.e. NAT)
            treats a NCR as an atomic operation; hence none of the requested
            bindings will be established by NAT. Either all requested actions
            within a NCR are completed successfully, or the entire request
            fails.</t>

            <t>If DNCA agent does not have sufficient resources to process a
            request, it will return NCA with Result-Code set to
            RESOURCE_FAILURE.</t>

            <t>In case Max-NAT-Binding and Nat-Control-Definition are included
            in the NCR along with a reference to a binding rule (i.e. a
            predefined template on NAT) and the values in Max-NAT-Binding and
            NAT-Control-Definition contradict those specified in the pre-
            defined binding rule, Max-NAT-Binding and NAT-Control-Definition
            override the values specified in the binding rule.</t>

      <section title="Session Re-Authorization">
        <t>Session re-authorization is performed if the DNCA manager desires
        to change the behavior of the NAT for an existing session.
        Re-authorization could be used, for example, to change the number of
        allowed bindings for a particular session, or establish or remove a
        pre-defined binding.</t>

        <t>The DNCA manager generates a NAT-Control Request (NCR) message to
        the DNCA agent with NC-Request-Type AVP set to UPDATE_REQUEST upon
        receiving a trigger signal. In case the session is updated
        successfully, the DNCA agent notifies the DNCA manager about
        successful session update using a NAT-Control Answer (NCA) message
        with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. <xref
        target="fig-session-re-auth"></xref> shows the protocol interaction
        between the DNCA manager and the DNCA agent.</t>

        <t>In certain cases, the DNCA agent may not be able to perform the
        tasks requested within the NCR. These include the following: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>If DNCA agent receives a NCR update/query request for
            non-existent session it will set error code in answer, to
            DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.</t>

            <t>If the NCR contains a binding rule not defined on the NAT, the
            DNCA agent will return a NCA with Result-Code AVP set to
            UNKNOWN_BINDING_RULE.</t>

            <t>If the DNCA agent cannot establish the requested binding
            because the maximum number of allowed bindings has been reached
            for the Endpoint Classifier, it will return NCA with Result-Code
            AVP set to MAXIMUM_BINDINGS_REACHED_FOR_ENDPOINT.</t>

            <t>In case the DNCA agent cannot establish some or all of the
            bindings requested in a NCR, but has not yet reached the maximum
            number of allowed bindings for the subscriber, it will return a
            NCA with Result-Code set to BINDING_FAILURE. The DNCA agent (i.e.
            NAT) treats a NCR as an atomic operation; hence none of the
            requested bindings will be established by NAT. Either all
            requested actions within a NCR are completed successfully, or the
            entire request fails.</t>

            <t>If DNCA agent does not have sufficient resources to process a
            request, it will return a NCA with Result-Code set to
            RESOURCE_FAILURE.</t>

            <t>If a NCR redefines the maximum number of NAT bindings allowed
            for the endpoint, the new value will override any previously
            defined limit on NAT-bindings. It depends on the implementation of
            the NAT how NAT would cope with a case where the new value is
            lower than the actual number of allocated bindings. Typically the
            NAT would refrain from enforcing the new limit immediately (i.e.
            actively remove bindings) but rather disallow the establishment of
            new bindings until the current number of bindings is lower than
            the newly established maximum number of allowed bindings.</t>

            <t>If a NCR specifies a new binding rule, predefined on the DNCA
            agent, the binding rule will override any previously defined rules
            for the session.</t>

            <t>In case Max-NAT-Binding and Nat-Control-Definition AVPs are
            included in the NCR along with a reference to a binding rule (i.e.
            a predefined template on NAT) and the values in Max-NAT-Binding
            and Nat-Control-Definition AVPs contradict those specified in the
            pre-defined binding rule, Max-NAT-Binding and
            NAT-Control-Definition AVPs override the values specified in the
            binding rule.</t>

      <section title="Session And Binding Query">
        <t>Session query can be used by the DNCA manager to either retrieve
        information on the current bindings for a particular session at the
        NAT or discover the session identifier for a particular external
        IP-address/port pair.</t>

        <t>The DNCA manager initiates a session query by sending a NAT-Control
        Request (NCR) message to the DNCA agent with NC-Request-Type AVP set
        to QUERY_REQUEST. <xref target="fig-session-query"></xref> shows the
        protocol interaction between the DNCA manager and the DNCA agent.</t>

        <t>Two types of query requests exist. The first type of query request
        uses the session ID as input parameter to the query. It is to allow
        the DNCA manager retrieve the current set of bindings for a specific
        session. The second type of query request is used in to retrieve the
        session identifiers, along with the associated bindings, matching a
        criteria. This enables the DNCA manager to find out which sessions
        utilize a specific external IP address.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Request a list of currently allocated NAT-bindings for a
            particular session: The DNCA agent will, on receipt of the NCR,
            lookup the session information for the session id contained in the
            NCR, and will report all currently active NAT-bindings for the
            session using a NAT-Control Answer (NCA) message with Result-Code
            set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. In this case the NCR MUST NOT contain a
            NAT-Control-Definition AVP. Each NAT-Binding will be reported in a
            NAT-Control-Definition AVP. In case the session id is unknown to
            the DNCA agent a DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID error is
            returned.</t>

            <t>Retrieve session ids and internal IP-address/port pairs for one
            or multiple external IP-address/port pairs: If the DNCA manager
            wishes to retrieve the session id(s) for one or multiple external
            IP-address/port pairs, it MUST include the external
            IP-address/port pair(s) as part of the NAT-Control-Definition AVP
            of the NCR. The session id used within the NCR is not meaningful
            for this type of a query. The DNCA agent will report the
            NAT-bindings and associated session ids corresponding to the
            external IP-address/port pairs in a NAT-Control Answer (NCA)
            message with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS and the same
            session id as the one used in the NCR. In case an external
            IP-address/port pair has no associated existing NAT-binding, the
            NAT-Control-Definition AVP contained in the reply just contains
            the NAT-External-Address AVP.</t>

      <section title="Session Termination">
        <t>The DNCA manager generates a NAT-Control Request (NCR) message to
        the DNCA agent with NC-Request-Type AVP set to TERMINATE_REQUEST upon
        receiving a trigger signal. The DNCA agent sends accounting stop
        record reporting all the bindings and notifies the DNCA manager about
        successful session termination using a NAT-Control Answer (NCA)
        message with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. <xref
        target="fig-session-terminate"></xref> shows the protocol interaction
        between the DNCA manager and the DNCA agent.</t>

        <t>If a DNCA agent receives a NCR from a DNCA manager with
        NC-Request-Type AVP set to TERMINATE_REQUEST and fails to find a
        matching session, the DNCA agent returns DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID
        error.</t>

      <section title="DNCA Manager/Agent Failures">
        <t>This document does not cover details in case DNCA manager and DNCA
        agent go out of sync, which could happen for example due to DNCA
        manager or DNCA agent restart, (temporary) loss of network
        connectivity etc. DNCA application will rely on DNCA Manager and DNCA
        Agent to have builtin redundancy support to recover state in case of
        failure.</t>

        <t>Example failure cases include the following:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The DNCA manager loses session state (e.g. due to a restart).
            In this case, <list style="symbols">
                <t>the DNCA agent may receive a NCR with NC-Request-Type AVP
                set to INITIAL_REQUEST that matches an existing session of
                DNCA agent. The DNCA agent will return an error that contains
                Duplicate-Session-Id AVP to report Session-Id of existing
                session. The DNCA manager may then send an explicit
                TERMINATE_REQUEST for the older session that was lost.</t>

                <t>the DNCA manager may receive accounting records for a
                session that does not exist. The DNCA manager will send an
                accounting answer with error-code set to
                DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID. On receipt of which the DNCA
                agent clears the session and removes the associated session
                state.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>The DNCA agent loses session state. In such a case, the DNCA
            agent could receive a NCR with NC-Request-Type AVP set to
            UPDATE_REQUEST for a non-existent session. The DNCA agent will
            return NCA with error code set to DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.
            State recovery procedures of the DNCA agent will be covered in a
            future version of this document.</t>

            <t>The DNCA manager is unreachable (as e.g. detected by Diameter
            watchdog) or down and accounting requests from the DNCA agent fail
            to get a response. The mechanism to ensure that a DNCA manager no
            longer has associated state for a session being cleared at the
            DNCA agent is beyond the scope of this document.</t>

            <t>The DNCA agent is unreachable or down and NCR requests fail to
            get a response. Handling of this case depends on the actual
            service offering of the service provider. The service provider
            could, for example, choose to terminate the access session to the
            endpoint.</t>

        global endpoint identifier. The DNCA agent and DNCA manager maintain
        state associated with the Session-Id. This globally unique Session-Id
        is used for updating, accounting for and terminating the session. DNCA
        session MUST NOT have more than one outstanding request at any given
        instant. The DNCA agent sends an Abort-Session-Request as defined in
        <xref target="RFC3588"></xref> if it is unable to maintain sessions
        due to resource limitation.</t>

      <t>The DNCA agent sends an ACR Start on receiving an NCR with
      NC-Request-Type AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST received for a session, or on
      creation of the first binding for a session requested in an earlier NCR.
      The DNCA may send ACR Interim updates, if required, either due to a
      change in bindings resulting from an NCR with NC-Request-Type AVP set to
      UPDATE_REQUEST, or periodically as specified in Acct-Interim-Interval by
      DNCA Manager or when it creates/tears down bindings. An ACR Stop is sent
      by the DNCA agent on receiving an NCR with NC-Request-Type AVP set to
      TERMINATION_REQUEST.</t>

      <t>The function of correlating the multiple bindings used by an endpoint
      at any given time is relegated to the post processor.</t>

      <t>The DNCA agent may trigger an interim accounting record when maximum
      number of bindings, if received in NCR, is reached.</t>

      <section title="NAT Control Accounting Messages">
        <t>The ACR and ACA messages are reused as defined in Diameter Base
        Protocol <xref target="RFC3588"></xref> for exchanging endpoint NAT
        binding details between the DNCA agent and the CDF. DNCA Application
        ID is used in the accounting commands. ACR will contain one or more
        optional NAT-Control-Record AVP to report the bindings. The DNCA agent
        indicates the number of the currently allocated NAT bindings to the
        DNCA manager using the Current-NAT-Bindings AVP. This number needs to
        match the number of bindings identified as active within the
        NAT-Control-Record AVP.</t>

      <section title="NAT Control Accounting AVPs">
        <t>In addition to AVPs for ACR specified in <xref

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Similar to what the Diameter QoS application (see <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dime-diameter-qos"></xref>) does for authorization of
      QoS reservations, this document describes procedures for authorizing
      network address translation related attributes and parameters by an
      entity which is non-local to the device performing network address
      translation. The security considerations for the Diameter QoS
      application (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-dime-diameter-qos"></xref>
      section 11) apply in a similar way to the DNCA. Securing the information
      exchange between the authorizing entity (the DNCA manager) as well as
      the NAT device requires bilateral authentication of the involved
      parties, authorization of the involved parties to perform the required
      procedures and functions, as well as procedures to ensure integrity and
      confidentiality of the information exchange. DNCA makes use of the
      capabilities offered by Diameter as well as the underlying transport
      protocols to deliver on these requirements (see <xref
      target="sec-diameter-messages"></xref> ).</t>

      <t>It is assumed that the DNCA agent and DNCA manager are in the same
      domain and have a mutual trust set up. Authorization between the DNCA
      agent and DNCA manager is beyond the scope of this document.</t>

     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
