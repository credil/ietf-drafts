Internet-Draft           Service Boundary Holes               March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The LoST protocol [RFC5222] describes a protocol that's primary
   purpose is to map service and locations to destination addresses.
   LoST does this by provisioning boundary maps or areas against service
   URNs.  The boundary is a polygon made up of sets of geodetic
   coordinates specifying an enclosed area.  In some circumstances an
   area enclosed by a polygon, also known as an exterior polygon, may
   contain exception areas, or holes, that for the same service must
   yield a different destination to that described by the larger area.
   This document describes how holes SHOULD be specified in service
   boundaries defined using a GML encoding for the polygons and their
   internal elements (holes).  GML polygons are based on elements
   defined in [ISO-19107].

3.  Specifying Holes

   Holes related to an exterior boundary polygon MUST adhere to the
   following rules:

   Rule 1:   Two holes MUST NOT have more than one point of
             intersection.  If two or more holes share a common set of
             boundaries then to the primary polygon these represent a
             single hole in the service.  The internal elements (holes)
             should have common boundaries removed and a single hole
             created irrespective of whether the excluded area is itself
             made up of multiple service boundaries.

   Rule 2:   A hole MUST NOT have more than one point of intersection
             with the outer-boundary of the primary (exterior) polygon.
             If more than one point of intersection occurs the primary
             polygon is either doesn't have a hole, it has an inlet as
             in Figure 3, or the primary polygon SHOULD be expressed as
             two polygons as in Figure 4.

   represented as two polygons mapping to the same service.

   Rule 3:   A hole MUST be a legal polygon in accordance with the
             geoshape specification [geoshape].  There is no restriction

4.  GML Polygons

   The GML encoding of a polygon defines a enclosed exterior boundary,
   with the first and last points of boundary being the same.  Consider

5.  Holes in GML Polygons

   A hole is specified in the polygon by defining an interior boundary.
   The points defining the internal boundary define the area represented
   by the hole in the primary (exterior) polygon.  The shaded area in
   Figure 6 is represented by the 4 points of the interior boundary
   specified by (w,z,y,x).

6.  Service Boundary Specification and Selection Algorithm

   A service boundary is represented by a polygon that may have many
   vertices.  The enclosed area of the polygon represents the area in
   which a service, expressed as a service URN, maps to a single URI.

   Figure 6 is used to illustrate two service boundaries.  The first
   service boundary A->F shall be referred to as area-A, and the second
   service boundary w->z shall be referred to as area-w.  Furthermore,
   area-A is directly represented by the GML encoding provided in
   Figure 6.  Area-w is represented as a hole in area-A by the interior
   boundary.  Since area-w is also a service boundary, a separate
   polygon describing this area is also required and is shown in
   Figure 7 (note the reversal of the vertices).

   <gml:Polygon srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326">
     <gml:exterior>
       <gml:LinearRing>
         <gml:pos>43.411 -73.322</gml:pos> <!--w-->
         <gml:pos>43.211 -73.322</gml:pos> <!--z-->
         <gml:pos>43.211 -73.222</gml:pos> <!--y-->
         <gml:pos>43.411 -73.222</gml:pos> <!--x-->
         <gml:pos>43.411 -73.322</gml:pos> <!--w-->
       </gml:LinearRing>
     </gml:exterior>
   </gml:Polygon>

   If this data were in a LoST server the data mappings may look similar
   to the example in Figure 8.  This is an example only and does not
   represent actual LoST server provisioning or data transfer records.

                 Figure 8: Service Boundary Specifications

   It is considered likely that LoST servers will need to provide
   responses sufficiently quickly to allow real-time queries to be
   performed as part of an emergency call routing flow.  It is for this
   reason that databases supporting native geospatial query techniques
   are desirable and that service boundary specifications that are
   easily mapped to internal data structures are preferred.  Using
   interior boundaries makes support for this operation easy, while
   allowing an arbitrary number of holes in a service boundary to be
   specified.

   Each polygon is stored in the geospatial database and mapped to a
   service URN and destination URI.  Many geospatial databases natively
   support polygons with interior exclusions.  Without native support,
   interior boundaries can be stored against the polygon and can checked
   separately.  A location falls within the area described by a polygon
   if it is within the exterior boundary and not within any interior
   boundary.
