INTERNET-DRAFT     RADIUS Crypto-Agility Requirements      12 March 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  General

   This memo describes the requirements for a crypto-agility solution
   for Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS).  This memo,
   when approved, reflects the consensus of the RADIUS Extensions
   Working Group of the IETF (RADEXT) as to the features, properties and
   limitations of the crypto-agility work item for RADIUS.  It also
   defines the term "crypto-agility" as used in this context, and
   provides the motivations for undertaking and completing this work.

   The requirements defined in this memo have been developed based on e-
   mail messages posted to the RADEXT WG mailing list, which may be
   found in the archives of that list.  The purpose of framing the
   requirements in this memo is to formalize and memorialize them for
   future reference, and to bring them explicitly to the attention of
   the IESG and the IETF Community, as we proceed with this work.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   A RADIUS crypto-agility solution is not compliant with this
   specification if it fails to satisfy one or more of the MUST or MUST
   NOT statements.  A solution that satisfies all the MUST, MUST NOT,
   SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT statements is said to be "unconditionally
   compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST and MUST NOT statements
   but not all the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT requirements is said to be
   "conditionally compliant".

1.3.  The Charge

   At the IETF-66 meeting, the RADEXT WG was asked by members of the
   Security Area Directorate to undertake the action item to prepare a
   formal description of a crypto-agility work item, and corresponding
   milestones in the RADEXT Charter.  After consultation with one of the
   Security Area Directors, Russ Housley, text was initially proposed on
   the RADEXT WG mailing list on October 26, 2006.  That text reads as
   follows:

   The RADEXT WG will review the security requirements for crypto-
   agility in IETF protocols, and identify the deficiencies of the
   existing RADIUS protocol specifications against these requirements.
   Specific attention will be paid to RFC 4962 [RFC4962].

INTERNET-DRAFT     RADIUS Crypto-Agility Requirements      12 March 2011


   The RADEXT WG will propose one or more specifications to remediate
   any identified deficiencies in the crypto-agility properties of the
   RADIUS protocol.  The known deficiencies include the issue of
   negotiation of substitute algorithms for the message digest
   functions, the key-wrap functions, and the password-hiding function.
   Additionally, at least one mandatory to implement cryptographic
   algorithm will be defined in each of these areas, as required.

2.  A Working Definition of Crypto-Agility

   A generalized definition of crypto-agility was offered up at the
   RADEXT WG session during IETF-68.  Crypto-Agility is the ability of a
   protocol to adapt to evolving cryptography and security requirements.
   This may include the provision of a modular mechanism to allow
   cryptographic algorithms to be updated without substantial disruption
   to fielded implementations.  It may provide for the dynamic
   negotiation and installation of cryptographic algorithms within
   protocol implementations (think of Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLL)).

   In the specific context of the RADIUS protocol and RADIUS
   implementations, crypto-agility may be better defined as the ability
   of RADIUS implementations to automatically negotiate cryptographic
   algorithms for use in RADIUS exchanges, including the algorithms used
   to integrity protect and authenticate RADIUS packets and to hide
   RADIUS Attributes.  This capability covers all RADIUS message types:
   Access-Request/Response, Accounting-Request/Response, CoA/Disconnect-
   Request/Response, and Status-Server.  Negotiation of cryptographic
   algorithms MAY occur within the RADIUS protocol, or within a lower
   layer such as the transport layer.

   Since RADIUS is a request/response protocol, the ability to negotiate
   cryptographic algorithms within a single RADIUS exchange is
   inherently limited.  While a RADIUS request can provide a list of
   supported cryptographic algorithms which can selected for use within
   a response, prior to the receipt of a response, the cryptographic
   algorithms utilized to provide security services within the request
   will need to be determined a-priori.

   Proposals MUST NOT introduce new capabilities negotiation features
   into the RADIUS protocol and crypto-agility solutions SHOULD NOT
   require changes to the RADIUS operational model as defined in "RADIUS
   Design Guidelines" [RFC6158] Section 3.1 and Appendix A.4.
   Similarly, a proposal SHOULD focus on the crypto-agility problem and
   nothing else.  For example, proposals SHOULD NOT require new
   attribute formats and SHOULD be compatible with the guidance provided
   in [RFC6158] Section 2.3.

   Acceptable solutions for determining the mechanisms to be used within



Nelson                        Informational                     [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT     RADIUS Crypto-Agility Requirements      12 March 2011


   a request include manual configuration as well as backward compatible
   negotiation techniques such as those described in Section 4.3.
   Solutions for determining the mechanisms to be used in a response
   include manual configuration and "advertise and select" mechanisms
   (e.g. selection within the response from mechanisms advertised in a
   request).

3.  The Current State of RADIUS Security

   RADIUS packets, as defined in [RFC2865], are protected by an MD5
   message integrity check (MIC), within the Authenticator field of
   RADIUS packets other than Access-Request [RFC2865] and Status-Server
   [RFC5997].  The Message-Authenticator Attribute utilizes HMAC-MD5 to
   authenticate and integrity protect RADIUS packets.

   While RADIUS does not support confidentiality of entire packets,
   various RADIUS attributes support encrypted (also known as "hidden")
   values, including: User-Password (defined in [RFC2865] Section 5.2),
   Tunnel-Password (defined in [RFC2868] Section 3.5), and various
   Vendor-Specific Attributes, such as the MS-MPPE-Send-Key and MS-MPPE-
   Recv-Key attributes (defined in [RFC2548] Section 2.4).  Generally
   speaking, the hiding mechanism uses a stream cipher based on a key
   stream from an MD5 digest.  Attacks against this mechanism are
   described in [RFC3579] Section 4.3.4.

   "Updated Security Considerations for the MD5 Message-Digest and the
   HMAC-MD5 Algorithms" [RFC6151] discusses security considerations for
   use of the MD5 and HMAC-MD5 algorithms.  While the advances in MD5
   collisions do not immediately compromise the use of MD5 or HMAC-MD5
   for the purposes used within RADIUS Eabsent knowledge of the RADIUS
   shared secret, the progress toward compromise of MD5's basic
   cryptographic assumptions has resulted in the deprecation of MD5
   usage in a variety of applications.  As noted in [RFC6151] Section 2:

      MD5 is no longer acceptable where collision resistance is required
      such as digital signatures.  It is not urgent to stop using MD5 in
      other ways, such as HMAC-MD5; however, since MD5 must not be used
      for digital signatures, new protocol designs should not employ
      HMAC-MD5.

4.  The Requirements

4.1.  Overall Solution Approach

   RADIUS crypto-agility solutions are not restricted to utilizing
   technology described in existing RFCs.  Since RADIUS over IPsec is
   already described in [RFC3162] Section 5 and [RFC3579] Section 4.2,
   this technique is already available to those who wish to use it.

INTERNET-DRAFT     RADIUS Crypto-Agility Requirements      12 March 2011


   Therefore, it is expected that proposals will utilize other
   techniques.

4.2.  Security Services

   Proposals MUST support the negotiation of cryptographic algorithms
   for per-packet integrity/authentication protection.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that solutions provide support for confidentiality,
   either by supporting encryption of entire RADIUS packets or by
   encrypting individual RADIUS attributes.  This includes providing
   support for improving the confidentiality of existing encrypted
   (sometimes referred to as "hidden") attributes as well as encrypting
   attributes (such as location attributes) that are currently
   transmitted in cleartext.  Proposals supporting confidentiality MUST
   support the negotiation of cryptographic algorithms for encryption.

   Proposals MUST support per-packet replay protection for all RADIUS
   message types.

   Crypto-agility solutions MUST avoid security compromise, even in
   situations where the existing cryptographic algorithms utilized by
   RADIUS implementations are shown to be weak enough to provide little
   or no security (e.g. in event of compromise of the legacy RADIUS
   shared secret).  Included in this would be protection against bidding
   down attacks.  In analyzing the resilience of a crypto-agility
   solution, it can be assumed that RADIUS requesters and responders can
   be configured to require the use of new secure algorithms in the
   event of a compromise of existing cryptographic algorithms or the
   legacy RADIUS shared secret.

   Crypto-agility solutions MUST specify mandatory-to-implement
   cryptographic algorithms for each defined mechanism.  Guidance on
   acceptable algorithms can be found in [NIST-SP800-131A].  In
   particular, it is RECOMMENDED that mandatory-to-implement
   cryptographic algorithms be chosen from among those classified as
   "Acceptable" with no known deprecation date within [NIST-SP800-131A].

   In addition to the goals referred to above, [RFC4962] Section 2
   describes additional security requirements, which translate into the
   following requirements for RADIUS crypto-agility solutions:

Strong, fresh session keys
     RADIUS crypto-agility solutions are REQUIRED to generate fresh
     session keys for use between the RADIUS client and server.  In
     order to prevent the disclosure of one session key from aiding an
     attacker in discovering other session keys,  RADIUS crypto-agility
     solutions are RECOMMENDED to support Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
     with respect to session keys negotiated between the RADIUS client

INTERNET-DRAFT     RADIUS Crypto-Agility Requirements      12 March 2011


     and server.

Limit key scope
     In order to enable a NAS and RADIUS server to transmit keying
     material directly, it is RECOMMENDED that a RADIUS crypto-agility
     solution be compatible with NAI-based Dynamic Peer Discovery
     [RADYN] as well as that it support the use of public key
     credentials for authentication between the NAS and RADIUS server.
     For compatibility with existing operations, RADIUS crypto-agility
     solutions SHOULD also support pre-shared key credentials.

Prevent the Domino effect
     In order to prevent the domino effect, RADIUS crypto-agility
     solutions MUST enable each RADIUS client and server pair to
     authenticate utilizing unique credentials.

4.3.  Backwards Compatibility

   Solutions to the problem MUST demonstrate backward compatibility with
   existing RADIUS implementations.  That is, an implementation that
   supports both the crypto-agility solution and legacy mechanisms MUST
   be able to talk with legacy RADIUS clients and servers (using the
   legacy mechanisms).

   While backward compatibility is needed to ease the transition between
   legacy RADIUS and crypto-agile RADIUS, use of legacy mechanisms is
   only appropriate prior to the compromise of those mechanisms.  After
   legacy mechanisms have been compromised, secure algorithms MUST be
   used, so that backward compatibility is no longer possible.

   In order to enable a request to be handled both by legacy as well as
   crypto-agile implementations, a request can be secured with legacy
   algorithms as well as more secure algorithms.  While this approach
   permits the initial use of legacy algorithms between crypto-agile
   implementations, if the responder indicates support for crypto-
   agility, future requests can omit use of legacy algorithms, instead
   utilizing mechanisms indicated in the response.

   This approach minimizes the response delay from both legacy and
   crypto-agile implementations.  However, it is viable only where
   legacy hidden attributes (e.g. User-Password) are not included within
   requests.

   Probing techniques can avoid the use of legacy algorithms between
   crypto-agile implementations.  An initial request can omit use of
   legacy mechanisms, and if a response is received, then the recipient
   can be assumed to be crypto-agile and future requests to that
   recipient can utilize secure mechanisms.  Similarly, the responder



Nelson                        Informational                     [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT     RADIUS Crypto-Agility Requirements      12 March 2011


   can assume that the requester supports crypto-agility and can
   prohibit use of legacy mechanisms in future requests.

   If a response is not received, in the absence of information
   indicating responder support for crypto-agility (such as pre-
   configuration or previous receipt of a crypto-agile response), a new
   request can be composed utilizing legacy mechanisms.

   Since legacy implementations not supporting crypto-agility will
   silently discard requests not protected by legacy algorithms rather
   than returning an error, repeated requests may be required to
   distinguish lack of support for crypto-agility from packet loss or
   other failure conditions.  As a result, probing techniques can delay
   initial communication between crypto-agile requesters and legacy
   responders.  This can be addressed by upgrading the responders (e.g.
   RADIUS servers) first.

4.4.  Interoperability and Change Control

   Proposals MUST indicate a willingness to cede change control to the
   IETF.

   Crypto-agility solutions MUST be interoperable between independent
   implementations based purely on the information provided in the
   specification.

4.5.  Scope of Work

   Crypto-agility solutions MUST apply to all RADIUS packet types,
   including Access-Request, Access-Challenge, Access-Reject, Access-
   Accept, Accounting-Request, Accounting-Response, Status-Server and
   CoA/Disconnect messages.

   Since it is expected that the work will occur purely within RADIUS or
   in the transport, message data exchanged with Diameter SHOULD NOT be
   affected.

   Proposals MUST discuss any inherent assumptions about, or limitations
   on, client/server operations or deployment and SHOULD provide
   recommendations for transition of deployments from legacy RADIUS to
   crypto-agile RADIUS.  Issues regarding cipher-suite negotiation,
   legacy interoperability and the potential for bidding down attacks,
   SHOULD be among these discussions.

4.6.  Applicability of Automated Key Management Requirements

   [RFC4107] provides guidelines for when automated key management is
   necessary.  At the IETF-70 meeting, and leading up to that meeting,



Nelson                        Informational                     [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT     RADIUS Crypto-Agility Requirements      12 March 2011


   the RADEXT WG debated whether or not RFC 4107 would require a RADIUS
   Crypto-Agility solution to feature Automated Key Management (AKM).
   The working group determined that AKM was not inherently required for
   RADIUS based on the following points:

   o  RFC 4107 requires AKM for protocols that involve O(n^2) keys.
      This does not apply to RADIUS deployments, which require O(n)
      keys.

   o  Requirements for session key freshness can be met without AKM,
      for example, by utilizing a pre-shared key along with an exchange
      of nonces.

   o  RADIUS does not require the encryption of large amounts of data in
      a short time.

   o  Organizations already have operational practices to manage
      existing RADIUS shared secrets to address key changes required
      as a result of personnel changes.

   o  The crypto-agility solution can avoid use cryptographic modes of
      operation such as a counter mode cipher that require frequent key
      changes.

   However, the same time, it is recognized that features recommended in
   Section 4.2 such as support for PFS and direct transport of keys
   between a NAS and RADIUS server, can only be provided by a solution
   supporting AKM.  As a result, support for Automated Key Management is
   RECOMMENDED within a RADIUS crypto-agility solution.

   Also, automated key management is REQUIRED for RADIUS crypto-agility
   solutions that use cryptographic modes of operation that require
   frequent key changes.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   Potential attacks against the RADIUS protocol are described in RFC
   3579 [RFC3579] Section 4.1, and details of known exploits as well as
   potential mitigations are discussed in [RFC3579] Section 4.3.

   This specification describes the requirements for new cryptographic
   protection mechanisms, including the modular selection of algorithms
   and modes.  Therefore, the subject matter of this memo is all about
   security.
