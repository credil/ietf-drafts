Abstract

   The Internet Society (ISOC) has declared that June 8th 2011 will be
   World IPv6 Day, on which organisations are being encouraged to test
   their production IPv6 deployment capability.  Many significant
   content providers and networks have stated they will take part.
   Given this date is likely to see more IPv6 traffic flowing across the
   Internet than has ever been seen before, it seems timely to issue a
   call to arms to review the status of ongoing open issues in IPv6
   deployment.  In this discussion document we list identified issues in
   IPv6 operations that may give rise to observed problems on June 8th.
   The World IPv6 Day should also create an excellent opportunity to
   observe the behaviour and performance of IPv6; it is thus very
   desirable to have appropriate measurement tools in place.

Internet-Draft         World IPv6 Day Call to Arms            March 2011


1.  Introduction

   Despite the recent exhaustion of the available IPv4 address pool,
   deployment of IPv6 remains limited.  To help encourage organisations
   to trial production deployment, ISOC has declared June 8th 2011 as
   World IPv6 Day. Organisations are encouraged to use this day to test
   IPv6 in production, either by enabling clients in their network, or
   by making externally-facing services available over IPv6.  This does
   not generally mean turning off IPv4 at this stage, rather enabling
   dual-stack networking.  However IPv6-only networks are inevitable,
   and some sites may choose to use June 8th to undertake some focused
   tests on that deployment model.

   The purpose of this document is two-fold.  One is to discuss common
   IPv6 deployment issues that are likely to arise on June 8th, with a
   focus on dual-stack deployment (which is likely to be how the vast
   majority of sites take part).  This should help raise awareness of
   those problems and possible mitigations.  The other is to encourage
   organisations to think about how they might get useful
   instrumentation on what happens in and to/from their networks on the
   day.  Such measurement tools are likely to also be useful longer term
   - once deployed they could be left in place.

   For most sites providing content, June 8th will be a chance to make
   some public facing services available over IPv6, such as web content
   using their production domain (e.g. www.example.com) rather than a
   contrived IPv6 test domain (e.g. www.ipv6.example.com).  Some
   enterprise sites may choose to enable IPv6 in user/client subnets, in
   which case the performance of those systems and the applications they
   run will be of paramount interest.

   This document is not intended to cover all IPv6 deployment issues,
   e.g. debates on DHCPv6 versus RAs, rather to focus on those that
   affect IPv6 connectivity, to raise awareness of these, and potential
   mitigations.

   NB.  This is a very rough first draft of the document; feedback is
   welcomed.  The scope of the document is purely informational to
   provoke discussion.


2.  Connectivity

   In this section we review causes of some common connectivity issues.

Internet-Draft         World IPv6 Day Call to Arms            March 2011


2.1.  Unmanaged Tunnels

   One cause of connectivity problems is the use of unmanaged tunnels,
   in particular 'automated' methods that are not provisioned by the
   user's ISP.  The most common example is 6to4 [RFC3056], or more
   specifically the 6to4 relay approach described in [RFC3068].  If a
   host in a native IPv6 network has no route to 2002::/16 it cannot
   respond to 6to4 traffic it receives.  Similarly, a 6to4 router that
   cannot reach the well-known IPv4 anycast relay address cannot respond
   to traffic it receives from native IPv6 networks.

   One approach to this problem is to encourage sites/ISPs to run local
   relays, as discussed in [I-D.carpenter-v6ops-6to4-teredo-advisory].
   The alternative to reduce such problems is simply to obsolete 6to4,
   as proposed in [I-D.troan-v6ops-6to4-to-historic].

   It is worth noting that IPv6 tunnel brokers, such as those provided
   by SixXS (http://www.sixxs.net) and Hurricane Electric
   (http://tunnelbroker.net) provide a more robust, managed approach to
   IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnelled access.

2.2.  Connection Timeouts

   Where dual-stack systems - or rather the applications running on them
   - have a choice of IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity, timeouts can occur if
   there is no connectivity on the preferred protocol.  For example, if
   a AAAA DNS record exists for a web server, and IPv6 connectivity is
   broken, there is likely to be some timeout for the browser before the
   connection drops back to IPv4.

   The author has undertaken some informal tests at his own site, which
   shows that shows how different operating systems handle ICMP
   unreachables.  On Linux, web connections timeout after 20 seconds for
   'no response', but immediately for unreachables.  In contrast,
   Windows Vista was 20 seconds regardless of unreachables being
   received.  Any non-trivial delay will cause significant user
   frustration.

   An interesting solution to the problem is the 'happy eyeballs'
   approach described in [I-D.ietf-v6ops-happy-eyeballs].  This approach
   is now also being suggested for multiple interface systems.  However
   some people feel this 'workaround' is simply masking underlying
   problems that should be fixed.

2.3.  PMTU Discovery

   IPv6 mandates that fragmentation is only undertaken by the sending
   node, and thus IPv6 requires working PMTU Discovery.  An existing RFC

Internet-Draft         World IPv6 Day Call to Arms            March 2011


   gives Recommendations for Filtering ICMPv6 Messages in Firewalls
   [RFC4890].  If this guidance is not followed, connectivity problems
   are likely to arise.  Blindly filtering all ICMPv6 messages is not
   good practise.  The minimum MTU for IPv6 is 1280 bytes.

2.4.  Rogue Router Advertisements

   Within a site, hosts may use IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   (SLAAC).  However, it is possible for accidental (or malicious) rogue
   RAs to cause connectivity issues, as described in Rogue Router
   Advertisement Problem Statement [RFC6104].

   One solution to this problem is RA Guard [RFC6105], another is use of
   SEcure Neighbour Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971].  However neither of
   these is widely implemented yet.  Indeed, any reported operational
   experience of SEND in an enterprise network would be very welcome.


3.  Instrumentation

   In this section we discuss potential instrumentation approaches that
   may be configured for World IPv6 Day, and then retained longer term
   after the event.

3.1.  IPv6 traffic levels

   It should be possible to measure IPv6 traffic levels independently on
   dual-stack switch/router platforms, given implementations of
   appropriate MIBs.

   Application level measurement is also desirable, e.g. the ability of
   web log analysis packages to differentiate IPv4 and IPv6 visits.  If
   a site is making a specific application available for World IPv6 Day,
   it should be able to measure the IPv6 activity seen on that service.

3.2.  Client Web Access Success Rate

   There have been some recent studies on the capabilities of web
   clients to access content on dual-stack servers by IPv4, IPv6 or IPv6
   in the presence of both A and AAAA records existing for a web domain.

   This section will be expanded to include examples of measurement
   approaches.

3.3.  IPv4 Performance Comparison

   Where a dual-stack service is deployed, measuring the relative
   performance of both protocols is desirable.  This may primarily be a

Internet-Draft         World IPv6 Day Call to Arms            March 2011


   measurement of throughput or delay, but may also include
   availability/uptime measurement.

   Sites enabling IPv6 in clients should be aware that the volume of
   IPv6 traffic they may use on World IPv6 Day may be somewhat higher
   than normal, if in particular they are not part of the existing
   Google IPv6 programme and they start viewing all YouTube conent over
   IPv6.  A site's IPv6 capacity should thus match its available IPv4
   capacity; software tunneling of IPv6 over IPv4 may cause problems if
   traffic levels do rise significantly.


4.  IPv6-only testing

   The long-term IPv6 deployment plan is IPv6-only networking, rather
   than dual-stack.  It is not clear how quickly significant IPv6-only
   networks will emerge, but testing of approaches to IPv6-only
   operation is desirable as soon as possible.

   Some experience of NAT64 has been described in
   [I-D.tan-v6ops-nat64-experiences], though this appears to have used
   only NAT-PT so far.  An implementation of NAT64 is available at
   http://ecdysis.viagenie.ca.  Operational experience of IVI is also
   desirable.  An implementation of IVI is available at
   http://www.ivi2.org/IVI.


5.  Conclusions

   With the ISOC World IPv6 Day event due on June 8th 2011, this
   document aims to help focus attention on both improving awareness and
   mitigations of common causes of IPv6 connectivity problems, and
   encouraging sites and organisations to introduce appropriate
   instrumentation into their networks so they can observe traffic
   behaviour appropriately.

   This is the first version of the text, and is very drafty.  All
   comments are very welcome.


6.  Security Considerations

   There are no extra security consideration for this document.


7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no extra IANA consideration for this document.
