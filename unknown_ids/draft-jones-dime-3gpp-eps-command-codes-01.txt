Abstract

   This document registers a set of IANA Diameter Command Codes to be
   used in new vendor-specific Diameter applications defined for the
   Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Evolved Packet System
   (EPS).  These new Diameter applications are defined for MME and SGSN
   related interfaces in the Release 8 architecture.

1.  Introduction

   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is defining the
   Evolved Packet System (EPS) as part of their Release 8 architecture.
   As part of this architecture, the interfaces based on the Diameter
   protocol [RFC3588] require the definition of two new Diameter
   applications: the 3GPP S6a application (vendor-specific application
   id: 1677251) and 3GPP S13 application (vendor-specific application
   id: 1677252), both defined under the 3GPP vendor-id "10415".  These
   Diameter applications are described in [TS29.272].  This document
   defines the assigned values of the command codes used in these
   applications.


2.  Terminology

   The base Diameter specification (Section 1.4 of [RFC3588]) defines
   most of the terminology used in this document.  Additionally, the
   terms and acronyms defined in [TS29.272] are used in this document.


3.  Command Codes

   The 3GPP S6a application described in [TS29.272] requires the
   allocation of command code values for the following command pairs:

   o  Update-Location-Request/Answer (ULR/ULA)

   o  Cancel-Location-Request/Answer (CLR/CLA)

   o  Authentication-Information-Request/ Answer (AIR/AIA)

   o  Insert-Subscriber-Data-Request/Answer (IDR/IDA)

   o  Delete-Subscriber-Data-Request/Answer (DSR/DSA)

   o  Purge-UE-Request/Answer (PUR/PUA)

   o  Reset-Request/Answer (RSR/RSA)

   o  Notify-Request/Answer (NOR/NOA)

   The 3GPP S13 application described in [TS29.272] requires the
   allocation of a command code value for the following command pair:

   o  ME-Identity-Check-Request/Answer (ECR/ECA)

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
   Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC5226].

   This document defines values in the namespace that has been defined
   in the Diameter Base specification [RFC3588].  Section 11 of
   [RFC3588] (IANA Considerations) details the assignment criteria.

   IANA is requested to allocate the following command code values:

 +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Code Command Name                       Abbreviation Defined in     |

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes command codes used in applications which
   build on top of the Diameter base protocol and the same security
   considerations described in [RFC3588] are applicable to this
   document.  No further extensions are required beyond the security
   mechanisms offered by [RFC3588].
