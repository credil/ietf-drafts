Internet-Draft            DCCP Service Codes                 April 2009 

Abstract 

   This document describes the usage of Service Codes by the Datagram 
   Congestion Control Protocol, RFC 4340. It motivates the setting of a 
   Service Code by applications. Service Codes provide a method to 
   identify the intended service/application to process a DCCP 
   connection request. This provides improved flexibility in the use and 
   assignment of port numbers for connection multiplexing. The use of a 
   DCCP Service Code can also enable more explicit coordination of 
   services with middleboxes (e.g. network address translators and 
   firewalls). This document updates the specification provided in RFC 
   4340.

Internet-Draft            DCCP Service Codes                 April 2009 
    

    
1. Introduction 

   DCCP specifies a Service Code as a 4-byte value (32 bits) that 
   describes the application-level service to which a client application 
   wishes to connect ([RFC4340], section 8.1.2). A Service Code 
   identifies the protocol (or a standard profile, e.g. [ID.RTP]) to be 
   used at the application layer. It is not intended to be used to 
   specify a variant of an application, or a specific variant of a 
   protocol (Section 2.2).  

   The Service Code mechanism allows an application to declare the set 
   of services that are associated with server port numbers. This can 
   affect how an application interacts with DCCP. It allows decoupling 
   the role of port numbers to indicate a desired service from the role 
   in connection demultiplexing and state management. A DCCP application 
   identifies the requested service by the Service Code value in a DCCP-
   Request packet. Each application therefore associates one or more 
   Service Codes with each listening port ([RFC4340], section 8.1.2).  

   The use of Service Codes can assist in identifying the intended 
   service by a firewall and may assist other middleboxes (e.g., a proxy 
   server, network address translator (NAT) [RFC2663]). Middleboxes that 
   desire to identify the type of data a flow claims to transport, 
   should utilize the Service Code for this purpose. When consistently 
   used, the Service Code can provide a more specific indication of the 
   actual service (e.g. indicating the type of multimedia flow, or 
   intended application behaviour). 

   The more flexible use of server ports can also offer benefit to 
   applications where servers need to handle very large numbers of 
   simultaneous open ports to the same service. 

   RFC 4340 omits to describe the motivation behind Service Codes, nor 
   does it properly describe how Well Known and Registered server ports 
   relate to Service Codes.  The intent of this document is to clarify 
   these issues. 

1.1. History 

   It is simplest to understand the motivation for defining Service 
   Codes by describing the history of the DCCP protocol. 

   Most current Internet transport protocols (TCP [RFC793], UDP 
   [RFC768], SCTP [RFC4960], UDP-Lite [RFC3828]) used "Published" port 
   numbers from the Well Known or registered number spaces [RFC814]. 
   These 16-bit values indicate the application service associated with

   a connection or message. The server port must be known to the client 
   to allow a connection to be established.  This may be achieved using 
   out-of-band signaling (e.g. described using SDP [RFC4566]), but more 
   commonly a Published port is allocated to a particular protocol or 
   application; for example HTTP commonly uses port 80 and SMTP commonly 
   uses port 25. Making a port number Published [RFC1122] involves 
   registration with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), 
   which includes defining a service by a unique keyword and reserving a 
   port number from among a fixed pool [IANA].  

   In the earliest draft of DCCP, the authors wanted to address the 
   issue of Published ports in a future-proof manner, since this method 
   suffers from several problems: 

   o  The port space is not sufficiently large for ports to be easily 
      allocated (e.g. in an unregulated manner).  Thus, many 
      applications operate using unregistered ports, possibly colliding 
      with use by other applications. 

   o  The use of port-based firewalls encourages application-writers to 
      disguise one application as another in an attempt to bypass 
      firewall filter rules. This motivates firewall writers to use deep 
      packet inspection in an attempt to identify the service associated 
      with a port number.  

   o  ISPs often deploy transparent proxies, primarily to improve 
      performance and reduce costs.  For example, TCP requests destined 
      to TCP port 80 are often redirected to a web proxy. 

   These issues are coupled.  When applications collide on the same 
   Published, but unregistered port, there is no simple way for network 
   security equipment to tell them apart, with the likelihood of 
   introducing problems with interaction of features. 

   There is little that a transport protocol designer can do about 
   applications that attempt to masquerade as other applications. For 
   ones that are not attempting to hide, the problem may be simply that 
   they cannot trivially obtain a Published port.  Ideally, it should be 
   sufficiently easy that every application-writer can request a Well 
   Known or registered port and receive one instantly with no questions 
   asked. The 16-bit port space traditionally used is not large enough 
   to support such a trivial allocation of ports. 

   Thus, the design of DCCP sought an alternative solution.  The idea 
   was simple. A 32-bit server port space should be sufficiently large 
   that it enables use of very simple allocation policies.  However, 

 
 
G. Fairhurst           Expires October 28, 2009                [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft            DCCP Service Codes                 April 2009 
    

   overhead considerations made a 32-bit port value undesirable (DCCP 
   needed to be useful for low rate applications).   

   The solution in DCCP to this problem was to use a 32-bit Service Code 
   [RFC4340] that is included only in the DCCP-Request packet. The use 
   of a 32-bit value was intended to make it trivially simply to obtain 
   a unique value for each application. Placing the value in a DCCP-
   Request packet, requires no additional overhead for the actual data 
   flow.  It is however sufficient for both the end systems, and 
   provides any stateful middleboxes along the path with additional 
   information to understand what applications are being used. 

   Early discussion of the DCCP protocol considered an alternative to 
   the use of traditional ports; instead it was suggested that a client 
   used a 32-bit identifier to uniquely identify each connection. The 
   server listened on a socket bound only to a Service Code.  This 
   solution was unambiguous; the Service Code was the only identifier 
   for a listening socket at the server side. The DCCP client included a 
   Service Code in the request, allowing it to reach the corresponding 
   listening application. One downside was that this prevented 
   deployment of two servers for the same service on a single machine, 
   something that is trivial with ports. The design also suffered from 
   the downside of being sufficiently different from existing protocols 
   that there were concerns that it would hinder the use of DCCP through 
   NATs and other middleboxes.   

   RFC 4340 abandoned the use of a 32-bit connection identifier in favor 
   of two traditional 16-bit port values, one chosen by the server and 
   one by the client. This allows middleboxes to utilize similar 
   techniques for DCCP, UDP, TCP, etc. However, it introduced a new 
   problem: "How does the server port relate to the Service Code?"  The 
   intent was that the Service Code identified the application or 
   protocol using DCCP, providing middleboxes with information about the 
   intended use of a connection, and that the pair of ports effectively 
   formed a 32-bit connection identifier, which was unique between a 
   pair of end-systems. 

   The large number of available unique Service Code values allows all 
   applications to be assigned a unique Service Code. However, there 
   remains a current problem:  The server port is chosen by the server, 
   but the client needs to know this to establish a connection.  It was 
   undesirable to mandate out-of-band communication to discover the 
   server port.  A solution is to register DCCP server ports.  The 
   limited availability of DCCP server ports appears to contradict the 
   benefits of DCCP Service Codes, because although it may be trivial to 
   obtain a Service Code, it has not traditionally been trivial to 
   obtain a registered port from IANA and in the long-run it may not be

   possible to uniquely allocate a unique registered DCCP port to new 
   applications. As port numbers become scarce, this motivates the need 
   to associate more than one Service Code with a listening port (e.g. 
   two different applications could be assigned the same server port, 
   and need to run on the same host at the same time, differentiated by 
   their different associated Service Codes.  

   Service Codes provide flexibility in the way clients identify the 
   server application to which they wish to communicate. The mechanism 
   allows a server to associate a set of server ports with a service. 
   The set may be common with other services available at the same 
   server host, allowing a larger number of concurrent connections for a 
   particular service than possible when the service is identified by a 
   single Published port number. 

   There has been confusion concerning how server ports relate to 
   Service Codes. The goal of this document is to clarify this and the 
   issues concerning the use of Service Codes. 

   RFC4340 states that Service Codes are not intended to be DCCP-
   specific. Service Codes, or similar concepts may therefore also be 
   useful to other IETF transport protocols. 

1.2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 

2. An Architecture for Service Codes 

   DCCP defines the use of a combination of ports and Service Codes to 
   identify the server application ([RFC4340], section 8.1.2). These are 
   described in the following Sections.  

2.1. IANA Port Numbers 

   In DCCP, the packets belonging to a connection are de-multiplexed 
   based on a combination of four values {source IP address, source 
   port, dest IP address, dest port}, as in TCP. An endpoint address is 
   associated with a port number, (e.g. forming a socket); and a pair of 
   associations uniquely identifies each connection. Ports provide the 
   fundamental per-packet de-multiplexing function.  

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority currently manages the set of 
   globally reserved port numbers [IANA]. The source port associated 
   with a connection request, often known as the "ephemeral port", is 
 
 
G. Fairhurst           Expires October 28, 2009                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft            DCCP Service Codes                 April 2009 
    

   traditionally in the range 49152-65535, and also includes the range 
   1024-49151.  The value used for the ephemeral port is usually chosen 
   by the client operating system. It has been suggested that a 
   randomized choice of port number value can help defend against 
   "blind" attacks [ID.Rand] in TCP. This method may be applicable to 
   other IETF-defined transport protocols, including DCCP. 

   Traditionally, the destination (server) port value associated with a 
   service is determined either by an operating system index to a copy 
   of the IANA table (e.g., getportbyname() in Unix, which indexes the 
   /etc/services file), or directly mapped by the application. 

   The UDP and TCP port number space: 0..65535, is split into three 
   ranges [RFC2780]: 

   o  0..1023 "Well Known", also called "system" ports, 

   o  1024..49151 "registered", also called "user" ports, 

   o  49152..65535 "dynamic", also called "private" ports. 

   DCCP supports Well Known and registered ports. These are allocated in 
   the DCCP IANA port numbers registry ([RFC4340], Section 19.9). Each 
   registered DCCP port MUST be associated with at least one pre-defined 
   Service Code.  

   Applications that do not need to use a server port in the Well Known 
   or registered range SHOULD use a dynamic server port (i.e. that does 
   not require to be registered in the DCCP port registry). Clients can 
   identify the server port value for the services to which they wish to 
   connect using a range of methods. One common method is by reception 
   of a SDP record (Section 2.6) exchanged out-of-band (e.g. using SIP 
   [RFC3261] or RTSP [RFC2326]). DNS SRV resource records also provide a 
   way to identify a server port for a particular service based on the 
   services string name [RFC2782]. 

   Applications that do not use out-of-band signalling can still 
   communicate, providing that both client and server agree the port 
   value to be used. This eliminates the need for each registered 
   Service Code to be allocated an IANA-assigned server port (see also 
   Section 2.7). 
    
2.2. DCCP Service Code Values 

   DCCP specifies a 4 byte Service Code ([RFC4340], section 8.1.2) 
   represented in one of three forms: a decimal number (the canonical 

 
 
G. Fairhurst           Expires October 28, 2009                [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft            DCCP Service Codes                 April 2009 
    

   method), a four character ASCII string, or an eight digit hexadecimal 
   number.  

   The Service Code identifies the application-level service to which a 
   client application wishes to connect. Examples of services are RTP 
   [ID.RTP], TIME (this document), ECHO (this document). In a different 
   example, DTLS [RFC5238] provides a transport-service (not an 
   application-layer service), therefore applications using DTLS are 
   individually identified by a set of corresponding Service Code 
   values. 

   Endpoints MUST associate a Service Code with every DCCP socket 
   [RFC4340], both actively and passively opened. The application will 
   generally supply this Service Code. A single passive listening port 
   may be associated with more than one Service Code value. The set of 
   Service Codes could be associated with one or more server 
   applications. This permits a more flexible correspondence between 
   services and port numbers than possible using the corresponding 
   socket pair (4-tuple of layer-3 addresses and layer-4 ports). In the 
   currently defined set of packet types, the Service Code value is 
   present only in DCCP-Request ([RFC4340], section 5.2) and DCCP-
   Response packets ([RFC4340], section 5.3). Note new DCCP packet types 
   (e.g. [ID.Simul]) could also carry a Service Code value. 

2.2.1. New versions of Applications or Protocols 

   Applications/protocols that provide version negotiation or indication 
   in the protocol operating over DCCP do not require a new server port 
   or new Service Code for each new protocol version. New versions of 
   such applications/protocols SHOULD continue to use the same Service 
   Code. If the application developers feel that the new version 
   provides significant new capabilities (e.g. that will change the 
   behavior of middleboxes), they MAY allocate a new Service Code 
   associated with the same or a different set of Well Known ports. If 
   the new Service Code is associated with a Well Known or registered 
   port, the DCCP Ports registry MUST also be updated to include the new 
   Service Code value, but MAY share the same server port assignment(s). 

2.3. Service Code Registry 

   The set of registered Service Codes specified for use within the 
   general Internet are defined in an IANA-controlled name space. IANA 
   manages new allocations of Service Codes in this space ([RFC4340]). 
   Private Service Codes are not centrally allocated and are denoted by 
   the decimal range 1056964608-1073741823 (i.e. 32-bit values with the 
   high-order byte equal to a value of 63, corresponding to the ASCII 
   character '?').

Internet-Draft            DCCP Service Codes                 April 2009 
    

   Associations of Service Code with Well Known Ports are also defined 
   in the IANA DCCP Port Registry (section 2.1). 

2.4. Zero Service Code  

   A Service Code of zero is "permanently reserved (it represents the 
   absence of a meaningful Service Code)" [RFC4340]. This indicates that 
   no application information was provided. RFC 4340 states that 
   applications MAY be associated with this Service Code in the same way 
   as other Service Code values. This use is permitted for any server 
   port. 

   This document clarifies section 19.8 of RFC 4340, by adding the 
   following: 

   "Applications SHOULD NOT use a Service Code of zero.  

   Application writers that need a temporary Service Code value SHOULD 
   choose a value from the private range (section 2.3).  

   Applications intended for deployment in the Internet are encouraged 
   to use an IANA-defined Service Code. If no specific Service Code 
   exists, they SHOULD request a new assignment from the IANA." 

2.5. Invalid Service Code  

   RFC4340 defines the Service Code value of 0xFFFFFFFF as Invalid. This 
   is provided so implementations can use a special four-byte value to 
   indicate "no valid Service Code". Implementations MUST NOT accept a 
   DCCP-Request with this value, and SHOULD NOT allow applications to 
   bind to this Service Code value [RFC4340]. 

2.6. SDP for describing Service Codes 

   Methods that currently signal destination port numbers, such as the 
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] require extension to 
   support DCCP Service Codes [ID.RTP].  

2.7. A method to hash the Service Code to a Dynamic Port  

   Applications that do not use out-of-band signalling, or an IANA-
   assigned port still require both the client and server to agree the 
   server port value to be used. This Section describes an optional 
   method that allows an application to derive a default server port 
   number from the Service Code. The returned value is in the dynamic 
   port range [RFC4340]:

     int s_port; /* server port */ 
     s_port = (sc[0]<<7)^(sc[1]<<5)^(sc[2]<<3)^sc[3] | 0xC000; 
     if (s_port==0xFFFF) {s_port = 0xC000} 
    
   Where sc[] represents the four bytes of the Service Code, and sc[3] 
   is the least significant byte, for example this function associates 
   SC:fdpz with the server port 64634. 
    
   This algorithm has the following properties: 
    
   o  It identifies a default server port for each service. 

   o  It seeks to assign different Service Codes to different ports, but 
      does not guarantee an assignment is unique. 

   o  It preserves the four bits of the final bytes of the Service Code, 
      allowing mapping common series of Service Codes to adjacent ports, 
      e.g. Foo1, and Foo2; and Fooa and Foob would be assigned adjacent 
      ports. 

   o  It avoids the port 0xFFFF, which is not accessible on all host 
      platforms. 

   Applications and higher-layer protocols that have been assigned a 
   Service Code (or use a Service Code from the unassigned private 
   space) may use this method. It does not preclude other applications 
   using the selected server port, since DCCP servers are 
   differentiated by the Service Code value. 
    

3. Use of the DCCP Service Code 

   The basic operation of Service Codes is as follows: 

   A client initiating a connection: 

       .  issues a DCCP-Request with a Service Code and chooses a 
          destination (server) port number that is expected to be 
          associated with the specified Service Code at the destination. 

   o  A server that receives a DCCP-Request: 

       .  determines whether an available service matching the Service 
          Code is supported for the specified destination server port. 
          The session is associated with the Service Code and a 
          corresponding server. A DCCP-Response is returned.

Internet-Draft            DCCP Service Codes                 April 2009 
    

       .  if the service is not available, the session is rejected and a 
          DCCP-Reset packet is returned. 

3.1. Setting Service Codes at the Client 

   A client application MUST associate every DCCP connection (and hence 
   every DCCP active socket) with a single Service Code value 
   [RFC4340]). This value is used in the corresponding DCCP-Request 
   packet.  

3.2. Using Service Codes in the Network 

   DCCP connections identified by the Service Code continue to use IP 
   addresses and ports, although neither port number may be Published.  

   Port numbers and IP addresses are the traditional methods to identify 
   a flow within an IP network. Middlebox [RFC3234] implementors 
   therefore need to note that new DCCP connections are identified by 
   the pair of Server Port and Service Code in addition to the IP 
   address. This means that the IANA may allocate a server port to more 
   than one DCCP application [RFC4340].  

   Network address and port translators, known collectively as NATs 
   [RFC2663], may interpret DCCP ports [RFC2993] [ID.Behave-DCCP]. They 
   may also interpret DCCP Service Codes. Interpreting DCCP Service 
   Codes can reduce the need to correctly interpret port numbers, 
   leading to new opportunities for network address and port 
   translators. Although it is encouraged to associate specific delivery 
   properties with the Service Code, e.g. to identify the real-time 
   nature of a flow that claims to be using RTP, there is no guarantee 
   that the actual connection data corresponds to the associated Service 
   Code.  A middlebox implementor may still use deep packet inspection, 
   and other means, in an attempt to verify the content of a connection. 

   The use of the DCCP Service Code can potentially lead to interactions 
   with other protocols that interpret or modify DCCP port numbers 
   [RFC3234]. The following additional clarifications update the 
   description provided in section 16 of RFC 4340: 

   o  "A middlebox that intends to differentiate applications SHOULD 
      test the Service Code in addition to the destination or source 
      port of a DCCP-Request or DCCP-Response packet.  

   o  A middlebox that does not modify the intended application (e.g. 
      NATs [ID.Behave-DCCP] and Firewalls), MUST NOT change the Service 
      Code.

   o  A middlebox MAY send a DCCP-Reset in response to a packet with a 
      Service Code that is considered unsuitable." 

3.3. Using Service Codes at the Server 

   A Service Code is used by a server that receives a DCCP-Request to 
   associate a new DCCP connection with the corresponding application 
   service. A number of options are presented for servers using 
   passively listening sockets.  Four cases can arise when two DCCP 
   server applications listen on the same host: 

   o  The simplest case arises when two servers are associated with 
      different Service Codes and are bound to different server ports 
      (section 3.3.1). 

   o  Two servers may be associated with the same DCCP Service Code 
      value, but be bound to different server ports (Section 3.3.1).  

   o  Two servers could use different DCCP Service Code values, and be 
      bound to the same server port (section 3.3.2). 

   o  Two servers could attempt to use the same DCCP Service Code and 
      bind to the same server port.  A DCCP implementation MUST disallow 
      this, since there is no way for the DCCP host to direct a new 
      connection to the correct server application. 

   RFC 4340 (section 8.1.2) states that an implementation: 

   o  MUST associate each active socket with exactly one Service Code on 
      a specified server port. 

   In addition, section 8.1.2 also states: 

   o  "Passive sockets MAY, at the implementation's discretion, be 
      associated with more than one Service Code; this might let 
      multiple applications, or multiple versions of the same 
      application, listen on the same port, differentiated by Service 
      Code." 

   This document updates this text in RFC 4340 by replacing this with 
   the following: 

   o  "An implementation SHOULD allow more than one Service Code to be 
      associated with a passive server port, enabling multiple 
      applications, or multiple versions of an application, to listen on 
      the same port, differentiated by the associated Service Code."

Internet-Draft            DCCP Service Codes                 April 2009 
    

   It also adds: 

   o  "An implementation SHOULD provide a method that informs a server 
      of the Service Code value that was selected by an active 
      connection." 

   A single passively opened (listening) port MAY therefore be 
   associated with multiple Service Codes, although an active (open) 
   connection can only be associated with a single Service Code. A 
   single application may wish to accept connections for more than one 
   Service Code using the same server port. This may allow a server to 
   offer more than the limit of 65,536 services determined by the size 
   of the Port field. The upper limit is based solely on the number of 
   unique connections between two hosts (i.e., 4,294,967,296). 

3.3.1. Reception of a DCCP-Request  

   When a DCCP-Request is received, and the specified destination port 
   is not bound to a server, the host MUST reject the connection by 
   issuing a DCCP-Reset with Reset Code "Connection Refused". A host MAY 
   also use the Reset Code "Too Busy" ([RFC4340], section 8.1.3). 

   When the requested destination port is bound to a server, the host 
   MUST also verify that the server port is associated with the 
   specified Service Code. Two cases can occur: 

   o  If the receiving host is listening on a server port and the DCCP-
      Request uses a Service Code that is associated with the port, the 
      host accepts the connection. Once connected, the server returns a 
      copy of the Service Code in the DCCP-Response packet completing 
      the initial handshake [RFC4340]. 

   o  If the server port is not associated with the requested Service 
      Code, the server SHOULD reject the request by sending a DCCP-Reset 
      packet with Reset Code 8, "Bad Service Code" ([RFC4340], Section 
      8.1.2), but MAY use the reason "Connection Refused". 

   After a connection has been accepted, the protocol control block is 
   associated with a pair of ports and a pair of IP addresses and a 
   single Service Code value.  

3.3.2. Multiple Associations of a Service Code with Ports 

   DCCP Service Codes are not restricted to specific ports, although 
   they may be associated with a specific well-known port.  This allows 
   the same DCCP Service Code value to be associated with more than one 
   server port (in either the active or passive state).

3.3.3. Automatically launching a Server  

   A host implementation may permit a service to be associated with a 
   server port (or range of ports) that is not permanently running at 
   the server. In this case, the arrival of a DCCP-Request may require a 
   method to associate a DCCP-Request with a server that handles the 
   corresponding Service Code. This operation could resemble that of 
   "inetd" [inetd].  

   As in the previous Section, when the specified Service Code is not 
   associated with the specified server port, the connection MUST be 
   aborted and a DCCP Reset message sent [RFC4340]. 

4. DCCP Benchmarking Services 

   A number of simple services are commonly supported by systems using 
   TCP and UDP, this Section defines corresponding services for DCCP 
   [RFC4340]. These services are useful for debugging DCCP 
   implementations and deployment, and for benchmarking bidirectional 
   DCCP connections. The IANA Section of this document allocates a 
   corresponding set of code points for these services. 

4.1. Echo 

   The operation of the DCCP echo service follows that specified for UDP 
   [RFC862]: a server listens for DCCP connections; once a client has 
   set up a connection, each data packet sent to the server will be 
   copied (echoed) back to the client.  

4.2. Daytime 

   The DCCP daytime service is operationally equivalent to the 
   connection-based TCP daytime service [RFC867]: any data received is 
   discarded by the server; and generates a response sent in a DCCP data 
   packet containing the current time and date as an ASCII string; after 
   which the connection is closed.  

4.3. Character generator 

   The operation of the DCCP chargen service corresponds to the 
   connection-based TCP chargen protocol [RFC864]: A server listens for 
   incoming requests and, once a client has established a connection, 
   continuously sends datagrams containing a random number (between 0 
   and 512, not exceeding the current DCCP Maximum Packet Size, MPS) of 
   characters. The service terminates when the user either closes or 
   aborts the connection. Congestion control is enforced using the 
   mechanisms [RFC4340] and related documents.

Internet-Draft            DCCP Service Codes                 April 2009 
    

   If necessary, the receiver can enforce flow control on this service 
   by using either or both of the Slow Receiver ([RFC4340], section 
   11.6) and Data Dropped ([RFC4340], section 11.7) DCCP options to 
   signal the server to slow-down.  

   The chargen protocol provides a service that may be used for testing 
   and measurement of bidirectional DCCP connectivity, as well as 
   congestion control responsiveness. The datagram-based variant of 
   chargen can be emulated with the DCCP ECHO service by changing the 
   format of the datagrams sent by the client, hence these services 
   complement each other.  

4.4. Time service 

   The format of timestamps and the operation of the DCCP time service 
   is equivalent to the TCP time protocol variant [RFC868]: a server 
   listens for incoming connections; after a client has established a 
   new connection, the server sends a 4-byte timestamp; whereupon the 
   client closes the connection. 

4.5. Generic PerfTest service 

   The PerfTest service specified by this document provides a generic 
   service that may be used to benchmark and measure both unidirectional 
   and bidirectional DCCP connections, as well as server and host DCCP 
   stacks. These services are identified by the Service Code "XPER". 
   This document does not specify a specific port number for this 
   service. 

   The payload of DCCP packets associated with this service do not have 
   a specified format. They are silently discarded by the receiver, and 
   used only for gathering numerical performance data. Tools that have 
   specific payload formats should register their own Service Code value 
   with IANA (e.g., section 4.6). 

   This Service Code is for benchmarking applications that transmit data 
   in one direction only, with DCCP control traffic flowing in the 
   opposite direction. A benchmarking application that expects data 
   responses to the messages it sends would require a different Service 
   Code. (This could result in different Middlebox treatment.)  

4.6. PERF service 

   The PERF service specified by this document describes the service 
   supported by the open-source iperf benchmarking program [iperf].  
   This may be used to benchmark and measure both unidirectional and 
   bidirectional DCCP connections, as well as server and host DCCP

   stacks. This service is identified by a Service Code "PERF" and is 
   associated with a well-known port number that currently coincides 
   with the UDP port used by the iperf benchmarking program [iperf]. 

    

5. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations of RFC 4340 identifies and offers 
   guidance on security issues relating to DCCP. This document discusses 
   the usage of Service Codes. It does not describe new protocol 
   functions.  

   All IPsec modes protect the integrity of the DCCP header. This 
   protects the Service Code field from undetected modification within 
   the network. In addition, the IPsec Encapsulated Security Payload 
   (ESP) mode may be used to encrypt the Service Code field, hiding the 
   Service Code value within the network and also preventing 
   interpretation by middleboxes. The DCCP header is not protected by 
   application-layer security, (e.g., the use DTLS [RFC5238] as 
   specified in DTLS/DCCP [RFC4347]).   

   There are four areas of security that are important: 

   1. Server Port number reuse (section 5.1). 

   2. Interaction with NATs and firewalls (section 3.2 describes 
      middlebox behaviour). Requirements relating to DCCP are described 
      in [ID.Behave-DCCP].  

   3. Interpretation of DCCP Service Codes over-riding traditional use 
      of reserved/Well Known port numbers (Section 5.2). 

   4. Interaction with IPsec and DTLS security (section 5.3). 

5.1. Server Port number re-use 

   Service Codes are used in addition to ports when demultiplexing 
   incoming connections. This changes the service model to be used by 
   applications and middleboxes.  The port-numbers registry already 
   contains instances of multiple application registrations for a single 
   port number for TCP and UDP. These are relatively rare.  Since the 
   DCCP Service Code allows multiple applications to safely share the 
   same port number, even on the same host, server port number reuse in 
   DCCP may be more common than in TCP and UDP.

5.2. Association of applications with Service Codes 

   The use of Service Codes provides more ready feedback that a concrete 
   service is associated with a given port on a servers, than for a 
   service that does not employing service codes. By responding to an 
   inbound connection request, systems not using these codes may 
   indicate that some service is, or is not, available on a given port, 
   but systems using this mechanism immediately provide confirmation (or 
   denial) that a particular service is present. This may have 
   implications in terms of port scanning and reconnaissance. 

   Care needs to be exercised when interpreting the mapping of a Service 
   Code value to the corresponding service. The same service 
   (application) may be accessed using more than one Service Code. 
   Examples include the use of separate Service Codes for an application 
   layered directly upon DCCP and one using DTLS transport over DCCP 
   [RFC5238]. Other possibilities include the use of a private Service 
   Code that maps to the same application as assigned to an IANA-defined 
   Service Code value, or a single application that provides more than 
   one service. Different versions of a service (application) may also 
   be mapped to a corresponding set of Service Code values.  

   Processing of Service Codes may imply more processing than currently 
   associated with incoming port numbers. Implementers need to guard 
   against increasing opportunities for Denial of Service attack. 

5.3. Interactions with IPsec 

   The Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKEv2), does not currently 
   specify a method to use DCCP Service Codes as a part of the 
   information used to setup an IPsec security association. 

   IPsec uses port numbers to perform access control in transport mode 
   [RFC4301].  Security policies can define port-specific access control 
   (PROTECT, BYPASS, DISCARD), as well as port-specific algorithms and 
   keys. Similarly, firewall policies allow or block traffic based on 
   port numbers. 

   Use of port numbers in IPsec selectors and firewalls may assume that 
   the numbers correspond to Well Known services. It is useful to note 
   that there is no such requirement; any service may run on any port, 
   subject to mutual agreement between the endpoint hosts.  Use of the 
   Service Code may interfere with this assumption both within IPsec and 
   in other firewall systems, but it does not add a new vulnerability. 
   New implementations of IPsec and firewall systems may interpret the 
   Service Code when implementing policy rules, but should not rely on 
   either port numbers or Service Codes to indicate a specific service.

5.4. Security Considerations for Benchmarking Services 

   Services used for benchmarking and testing may also be used to 
   generate traffic for other purposes. They can therefore pose an 
   opportunity for a Denial of Service attack. Care needs to be 
   exercised when enabling these services in an operational network. 
   Appropriate rate-limits should be provided to mitigate these effects 
   for servers provided for testing. In this respect, the security 
   considerations are the same as those for other IETF-defined transport 
   protocols. 

    

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document does not update the IANA allocation procedures for the 
   DCCP Port Number and DCCP Service Codes Registries as defined in RFC 
   4340. 

6.1. IANA Assignments for Benchmarking Applications 

   A set of new services are defined in Section 4. Their corresponding 
   IANA assignments are summarized in this Section. 

   This document notes that it is not required to supply an approved 
   document (e.g. a published RFC) to support an application for a DCCP 
   Service Code or port number value, although RFCs may be used to 
   request Service Code values via the IANA Considerations Section. A 
   specification is however required to allocate a Service Code that 
   uses a combination of ASCII digits, uppercase letters, and character 
   space, '-', '.', and '/') [RFC4340]. 

6.1.1. Port number values allocated by this document 

   IANA action is required to assign server ports for use by DCCP. This 
   document requests allocation of the following code points from the 
   IANA DCCP Port numbers registry:

   Change Log. 

   01 introduced: 

   - a replacement of the word *range* when referring to sets of dccp 
   ports (they are not necessarily contiguous), noted by E. Kohler. 

   - Addition of some Service Codes in IANA Section. 

   02 introduced: 

   - add the use of profiles with DCCP, identified by Service Code, but 
   not the use of protocol variants. 

   - further detail on implementation levels (more input would be good)  

   - added security consideration for traffic generators 

   - added ref to UDPL for completeness 

   - Corrected NiTs found by Gerrit Renker 

   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

   WG 00 (first WG version) 

   This introduced revisions to make it a WG document.  

   - Corrected language and responded to many helpful comments from 
   Fernando Gont and Ian McDonald. 

   - Added a test for which server behaviour is used. 

   - Added some speculative text on how to implement the SC. 

   - More input and discussion is requested from the WG. 

   - Added an informative appendix on host configuration. 

   - Merging of some Sections to remove repetition and clarify wording.

   WG 01 

   Historical material was added. 

   Comments from the list have been included. 

   The concept of adding weak semantics to a SC=0 was removed. This was 
   added at the request of implementers, with the aim of offering easier 
   implementation on at least one target platform. It has been removed 
   in this document because it weakens interoperability and complicates 
   the Spec. 

   The proposal to allow several levels of support was introduced in 
   previous drafts following suggestions from the WG, but was removed in 
   this revision. The method was seen to introduce complexity, and 
   resulted in complex interoperability scenarios. 

   Removed "test" method, this was no longer required. 

   Draft was reorganized to improve clarity and simplify concepts. 

   ---- 

   WG 02 

   Updated following comments from Eddie Kohler. 

   ---- 

   WG 03 

   Fixed NiTs and addressed issues marked in previous version. 

   Added 2 para at end of port Section saying how to use Well Known 
   ports and that you do not need to register them. 

   ----- 

   WG 04 

   Cleaned English (removing duplication) 

   Checked text that updates RFC4340 (and remove duplicates). 

   Updated hash algorithm for SC->s_port 

   Updated to IANA Section.

   Edits in response to feedback from Tom Phelan, et al. 

   ----- 

   WG-05: 

   Various Sections were updated following feedback from the list, some 
   specific comments were: 

   Tom Phelan suggested clarification was needed for the usage of well-
   known ports in Section 1, and various other clarifications. 

   Eddie Kohler suggested reworking the midbox Section. 

   Eddie noted the hash function included the highest numbered port, 
   which is not accessible on all OS.  

   There was also discussion about the proper server port range to be 
   used with this method. After previous concerns that using registered 
   ports could have some (unknown) side effect, use was recommended in 
   the dynamic range. Text was added to this Section. 

   Discussions at IETF-71 lead to the idea to removing the IANA guidance 
   on maintaining the registries to a new document that defines the 
   policy across the set of transport registries. 

   Eddie noted that port-reuse is likely to be more common with DCCP 
   (security considerations). 

   Lars noted that rate-limiting benchmarking tools may be somewhat 
   undesirable, and this related to services for testing. 

   The text recommending an update to the IANA procedures for ports and 
   service codes has been moved to a TSV WG draft. 

   ----- 

   WG-06: 

   Updated the updating paragraphs to clarify the specific clauses of 
   RFC 4340 are changed. Comments from Eddie and Colin. 

   Very minor editorial corrections.

   Portname for Perf in registry changed to all lower case. 

   Replaced para 2 of intro and updated later parts of the introduction 
   (feedback in LC from Eddie). 

   Added citation to the Behave WG Requirements for NATs (now in LC). 

   ----- 

   WG-08: 

   New text to address editorial corrections proposed by Alfred Hoenes. 

   ----- 

   WG-09:Update following review feedback 

   Gen-ART 

   Section 3.2: Middlebox [RFC3234] implementors therefore need to note 
   that new DCCP connections are identified by the pair of Server Port 
   and Service Code. - Added "in addition to the IP address" to the end 
   of the above sentence for clarity. 

   Section 3.2: Updated sentence to read: This means that the IANA may 
   allocate a server port to more than one DCCP application [RFC4340]. 

   Section 3.3.2 rewritten as: DCCP Service Codes are not restricted to 
   specific ports, although they may be associated with a specific well-
   known port.  The same DCCP Service Code value may therefore be 
   associated with more than one server port (in either the active or 
   passive state). 

   Section 5.3: Added: The Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKEv2), does 
   not currently specify a method to use DCCP Service Codes as a part of 
   the information used to setup an IPsec security association. 

   Sec-Dir 

   Section 5: Added: The security considerations of RFC 4340 identifies 
   and offers guidance on security issues relating to DCCP. 

   Section 5.2: Added new paragraph: The use of Service Codes provides 
   more ready feedback that a concrete service is associated with a 
   given port on a servers, than for a service that does not employing 
   service codes. By responding to an inbound connection request, 
   systems not using these codes may indicate that some service is, or

   is not, available on a given port, but systems using this mechanism 
   immediately provide confirmation (or denial) that a particular 
   service is present. This may have implications in terms of port 
   scanning and reconnaissance. 

   Note: This I-D will be a normative reference in draft-ietf-dccp-
