1.  Introduction

   Softwire mesh framework RFC 5565 [RFC5565]is a tunneling mechanism
   which enables connectivity between islands of IPv4, IPv6 or dual-
   stack networks across single IPv4 or IPv6 backbone networks.  In
   softwire mesh solution, extended multiprotocol-BGP (MP-BGP)is used to
   set up tunnels and advertise prefixes among address family border
   routers (AFBRs).

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular it defines objects for managing softwire mesh
   [RFC5565].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from softwire problem statement RFC
   4925 [RFC4925] and softwire mesh framework RFC5565 [RFC5565].

4.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

5.  Overview

   The softwire mesh MIB provides a way to configure and manage the
   softwire mesh objects through SNMP.  It's a basis for manage and
   control softwire mesh framework.

6.  Structure of the MIB Module

6.1.  Textual Conventions

   The following textual conventions are defined:

           swmTunnelType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
           STATUS      current
           DESCRIPTION
             "Represents the TC for tunnel type will be used. According to
             section 4 of RFC 5512"
             SYNTAX     INTEGER {
                          gre(1),          -- GRE encapsulation
                          l2tpv3(2),       -- L2TPv3 encapsulation
                          ip-ip(3)         -- IP-IP encapsulation
                        }

6.2.  The swmInfo Subtree

   The swmInfo subtree provides basic softwire mesh information about
   the router.  It includes current state of the PE, the time when the
   PE change its current softwire mesh state.  Something else useful
   will be added.

6.3.  The swmVIfInfo Subtree

   The subtree provides softwire mesh virtual interface information
   about the router.  It includes what kind of tunnel type the PE
   supports to implement softwire mesh.  It also includes information
   about flow couting which was divided into 4over6 and 6over4.

6.4.  The swmNLRINHInfo Subtree

   The subtree provides softwire mesh NLRI-NH information about the
   router.  It indicates which address will be encapsulated according to
   the arriving packet's destination address.

6.5.  The swmBGPNeighInfo Subtree

   The subtree provides softwire mesh BGP neighbor information about the
   router.  It includes the address of softwire mesh BGP peer.  It also
   includes what kind of tunnel types that BGP peer can support.  This
   information also be divided into 4over6 BGP neighbors and 6over4 BGP
   neighbors.

6.6.  The swmConformance Subtree

   The subtree provides conformance information of MIB objects.

7.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

7.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The swmMIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

7.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   The Interfaces Group [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  This memo contains the extensions to the
   Interfaces Group for managing softwire mesh that are modeled as
   virtual interfaces.

7.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863] and
   INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001].

9.  Security Considerations

   The swmMIB module can be used for configuration of certain objects,
   and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly configured,
   with potentially disastrous results.

   There are some management objects defined in this MIB module with a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may
   be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
   These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  Unauthorized changes to the swmVIf4over6Table and
      swmVIf6over4Table may disrupt the configuration of the 4over6 mtu
      and 6over4 mtu of the virtual interface.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
