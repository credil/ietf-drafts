Abstract

   The rise of spam and other anti-social behavior on the
   Internet has led to the creation of shared blacklists and
   whitelists of IP addresses or domains.  The DNS has become a
   de-facto standard method of distributing these blacklists and
   whitelists.  This memo documents the structure and usage of
   DNS based blacklists and whitelists, and the protocol used to

1. Introduction

   In 1997, Dave Rand and Paul Vixie, well known Internet
   software engineers, started keeping a list of IP addresses
   that had sent them spam or engaged in other behavior that they
   found objectionable.  Word of the list quickly spread, and
   they started distributing it as a BGP feed for people who
   wanted to block all traffic from listed IP's at their routers.
   The list became known as the Real-time Blackhole List (RBL).

   Many network managers wanted to use the RBL to block unwanted
   e-mail, but weren't prepared to use a BGP feed.  Rand and
   Vixie created a DNS-based distribution scheme that quickly
   became more popular than the original BGP distribution.  Other
   people created other DNS-based blacklists either to compete
   with the RBL or to complement it by listing different
   categories of IP addresses.  Although some people refer to all
   DNS-based blacklists as ``RBLs'', the term properly is used
   for the MAPS RBL, the descendant of the original list.  (In
   the United States, the term RBL is a registered service mark
   of Trend Micro[3].)

   The standard term is now DNS Blacklist or Blocklist, or DNSBL.
   Some people also publish DNS-based whitelists or DNSWLs.

   This document describes the structure, operation, and use of
   DNSBLs and DNSWLs but does not describe or recommend policies
   for adding or removing addresses to and from DNSBLs and
   DNSWLs, nor does it recommend policies for using them, nor

   does it take a position on whether the DNS is the best way to
   distribute such data.  We anticipate that management policies
   will be addressed in a companion document.

2. Structure of an IP address DNSBL or DNSWL

   Originally, DNSBLs only listed IP addresses, and most DNSBLs
   and DNSWLs still list IP addresses.  A few DNSBLs and DNSWLs
   now list domain names instead.  The structure of a DNSBL and
   DNSWL are the same, so in the subsequent discussion we use the
   abbreviation DNSxL to mean either.

2.1. IP address DNSxL

   An IP address DNSxL has a structure adapted from that of the
   rDNS.  (The rDNS, reverse DNS, is the IN-ADDR.ARPA and
   IP6.ARPA domains used to map IP addresses to domain names.)
   Each IP address listed in the DNSxL has a corresponding DNS
   entry created by reversing the order of the octets of the text
   representation of the IP address, and appending the domain
   name of the DNSxL.  If, for example, the DNSxL is called
   bad.example.com, and the IP address to be listed is
   192.0.2.99, the name of the DNS entry would be
   99.2.0.192.bad.example.com.  Each entry in the DNSxL has an A
   record and often a TXT record.  The A record conventionally
   has the value 127.0.0.2, but may have other values as
   described below in Combined IP address DNSxLs.  The TXT record
   describes the reason that the IP is listed in the DNSxL, and
   is often used as the text of an SMTP error response when an
   SMTP client attempts to send mail to a server using the list
   as a DNSBL, or as explanatory text when the DNSBL is used in a
   scoring spam filter.  Some DNSxLs use the same TXT record for
   all entries, while others provide a different TXT record for
   each entry or range of entries that describes the reason that
   entry or range is listed.  The reason often includes the URL
   of a web page where more information is available.  Some
   client software only checks the A record, some only checks the
   TXT record, some checks both.

   If an IP address is not listed in the DNSxL, there is no
   record for the address.  If a /24 or larger range of addresses
   is listed, and the zone's server uses traditional zone files
   to represent the DNSxL, the DNSxL may use wildcards to limit
   the size of the zone file.  If for example, the entire range
   of 192.0.2.0/24 were listed, the DNSxL's zone could contain a
   single wildcard for *.2.0.192.bad.example.com.

2.2. IP address DNSWL

   Since SMTP has no standard way for a server to advise a client
   why a request was accepted, TXT records in DNSWLs are not very
   useful.  Some DNSWLs contain TXT records anyway to document
   the reasons that entries are present.

   It is possible and occasionally useful for a DNSxL to be used
   as a DNSBL in one context and a DNSWL in another.  For
   example, a DNSxL that lists the IP addresses assigned to
   dynamically assigned addresses on a particular network might
   be used as a DNSWL on that network's outgoing mail server or
   intranet web server, and used as a DNSBL for mail servers on
   other networks.

2.3. Combined IP address DNSxLs

   In many cases, an organization maintains a DNSxL that contains
   multiple entry types, with the entries of each type
   constituting a sublist.  For example, an organization that
   publishes a DNSBL listing sources of unwanted e-mail may wish
   to indicate why various addresses are included in the list,
   with one sublist for addresses listed due to sender policy, a
   second list for addresses of open relays, a third list for
   hosts compromised by malware, and so forth.  (At this point
   all of the DNSxLs with sublists of which we are aware are
   intended for use as DNSBLs, but the sublist techniques are
   equally usable for DNSWLs.)

   There are three common methods of representing a DNSxL with
   multiple sublists: subdomains, multiple A records, and bit
   encoded entries.  Most DNSxLs with sublists use both
   subdomains and one of the other methods.

   Sublist subdomains are merely subdomains of the main DNSxL
   domain.  If for example, bad.example.com had two sublists
   relay and malware, entries for 192.0.2.99 would be
   99.2.0.192.relay.bad.example.com or
   99.2.0.192.malware.bad.example.com.  Sublist names consist of
   letters, so there is no problem of name collisions with
   entries in the main domain, where the IP addresses consist of
   digits.

   To minimize the number of DNS lookups, multiple sublists can
   also be encoded as bit masks or multiple A records.  With bit
   masks, the A record entry for each IP is the logical OR of the
   bit masks for all of the lists on which the IP appears.  For
   example, the bit masks for the two sublists might be 127.0.0.1
   and 127.0.0.2, in which case an entry for an IP on both lists
   would be 127.0.0.3.  With multiple A records, each sublist has
   a different assigned value such as 127.0.1.1, 127.0.1.2, and
   so forth, with an A record for each sublist on which the IP
   appears.  There is no widely used convention for mapping
   sublist names to bits or values, beyond the convention that
   all A values are in the 127.0.0.0/8 range to prevent unwanted
   network traffic if the value is accidentally used as an IP
   address.

   DNSxLs that return multiple A records sometimes return
   multiple TXT records as well, although the lack of any way to
   match the TXT records to the A records limits the usefulness

Internet Draft                                      July 31, 2007


   of those TXT records.  Other combined DNSxLs return a single
   TXT record.

2.4. DNSxL cache behavior

   The per-record time-to-live and zone refresh intervals of
   DNSBLs and DNSWLs vary greatly depending on the management
   policy of the list.  A list of IP addresses assigned to
   dynamically allocated dialup and DHCP users could be expected
   to change slowly, so the TTL might be several days and the
   zone refreshed once a day.  On the other hand, a list of IP
   addresses that had been observed sending spam might change
   every few minutes, with comparably short TTL and refresh
   intervals.

2.5. Test and contact addresses

   Nearly all IP based DNSxLs contain an entry for 127.0.0.2 for
   testing purposes.  DNSBLs that return multiple values often
   have multiple test addresses so that, for example, the entry
   for 127.0.0.5 returns a 127.0.0.5 A record and corresponding
   TXT record.

   Most DNSxLs also contain an A record at the DNSxL's name that
   points to a web server, so that anyone wishing to learn about
   the bad.example.net DNSBL can check http://bad.example.net.

2.6. IPv6 DNSxLs

   No DNSxL based on IPv6 addresses has, to the best of our
   knowledge, been deployed yet.  The obvious format for one
   would use 32-component hex nibble-reversed IPv6 addresses in
   the same places where IPv4 DNSxLs use four-component decimal
   byte-reversed addresses.  A single DNSxL could in principle
   contain both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, since the different
   lengths prevent any ambiguity.  If a DNSxL is represented
   using traditional zone files and wildcards, there is no way to
   specify the length of the name that a wildcard matches, so
   wildcard names would indeed be ambiguous for DNSxLs served in
   that fashion.

3. Domain name DNSxLs

   A few DNSxLs list domain names rather than IP addresses.  They
   are sometimes called RHSBLs, for right hand side blacklists.
   The names of their entries contain the listed domain name
   followed by the name of the DNSxL.  If the DNSxL were called
   doms.example.net, and the domain invalid.edu were to be
   listed, the entry would be named invalid.edu.doms.example.net.
   A few name-based DNSBLs encode e-mail addresses using a
   convention adopted from DNS SOA records, so an entry for
   fred@invalid.edu would have the name
   fred.invalid.edu.doms.example.net.  There is no consistent
   convention for a test entry, but some name-based DNSxLs use

Internet Draft                                      July 31, 2007


   EXAMPLE.COM as a test entry.  Name-based DNSBLs are far less
   common than IP based DNSBLs.  There is no agreed convention
   for wildcards.

   Name-based DNSWLs can be created in the same manner as DNSBLs,
   and have been used as simple reputation systems with the
   values of bit fields in the A record representing reputation
   scores and confidence values.

4. Typical usage of DNSBLs and DNSWLs

   DNSxLs can be served either from standard DNS servers, or from
   specialized servers like rbldns[2] and rbldnsd[4] that accept
   lists of IP addresses and CIDR ranges and synthesize the
   appropriate DNS records on the fly.  Organizations that make
   heavy use of a DNSxL usually arrange for a private mirror of
   the DNSxL, either using the standard AXFR and IXFR or by
   fetching a file containing addresses and CIDR ranges for the
   specialized servers.

   DNSBL clients are most often mail servers or spam filters
   called from mail servers.  There's no requirement that DNSBLs
   be used only for mail, and other services such as IRC use them
   to check client hosts that attempt to connect to a server.

   Mail servers that test combined lists most often handle them
   the same as single lists and treat any A or TXT record as
   meaning that an IP is listed without distinguishing among the
   various reasons it might have been listed.  Some mail server
   and spam filtering software does have the ability to apply bit
   masks to retrieved A values in order to select particular
   sublists of a combined list.

   Mail servers typically check a list of DNSBLs and DNSWLs on
   every incoming SMTP connection, with the names of the DNSBLs
   and DNSWLs set in the server's configuration.  A common usage
   pattern is for the server to check each list in turn until it
   finds one with a DNSBL entry, in which case it rejects the
   connection, or a DNSWL entry in which case it accepts the
   connection.  If the address appears on no list at all (the
   usual case for legitimate mail), the mail server accepts the
   connection.  In another approach, DNSxL entries are used as
   inputs to a weighting function that computes an overall score
   for each message.

   The mail server uses its normal local DNS cache to limit
   traffic to the DNSxL servers and to speed up retests of IP
   addresses recently seen.  Long-running mail servers may cache
   DNSxL data internally.

   An alternate approach is to check DNSxLs in a spam filtering
   package after a message has been received.  In that case, the
   IP(s) to test are usually extracted from Received: headers or
   URIs in the body of the message.  The DNSxL results may be

Internet Draft                                      July 31, 2007


   used to make a binary accept/reject decision, or in a scoring
   system.

   Packages that test multiple headers need to be able to
   distinguish among values in lists with sublists since, for
   example, an entry indicating that an IP is assigned to dialup
   users might be treated as a strong indication that a message
   should be rejected if the IP sends mail directly to the
   recipient system, but not if the message were relayed through
   an ISP's mail server.

   Name-based DNSBLs have been used both to check domain names of
   e-mail addresses and host names found in mail headers, and to
   check the domains found in URLs in message bodies.

5. Security Considerations

   Any system manager that uses DNSxLs is entrusting part of his
   or her server management to the parties that run the lists.  A
   DNSBL manager that decided to list 0/0 (which has actually
   happened) could cause every server that uses the DNSBL to
   reject all mail.  Conversely, if a DNSBL manager removes all
   of the entries (which has also happened), systems that depend
   on the DNSBL will find that their filtering doesn't work as
   they want it to.

   Since DNSxL users usually make a query for every incoming e-
   mail message, the operator of a DNSxL can extract approximate
   mail volume statistics from the DNS server logs.  This has
   been used in a few instances to estimate the amount of mail
   individual IPs or IP blocks send[5,6].

   As with any other DNS based services, DNSBLs and DNSWLs are
   subject to various types of DNS attacks which are described in
   [1].
