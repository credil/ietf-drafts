1.  Introduction

   The US Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is rolling out 
   their Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based architecture at this 
   time.  This network will require more Resource-Priority header (RPH)
   namespaces than were defined, and IANA registered, in RFC 4412 
   [RFC4412].  The purpose of this document is to define these 
   additional namespaces.  Each will be RFC 4412 defined as preemption 
   based in nature, and will have the same 9 priority-values.  

   DISA has a requirement to be able to assign different RPH namespaces
   to different units of differing sizes throughout their networks. 
   Examples of this may be

   - each branch of service (army, navy, air force, marines, coast 
     guard)

   - some departments within the government (Homeland Security, 
     Commerce, Treasury) 

   - plus have temporary assignments to individual units of varying 
     sizes

   These temporary assignments might be combinations of smaller units 
   involving several branches of service operating as one unit (say, 
   one task force, which is separate than the branch of service), or a 
   single commando unit requiring special treatment for a short period 
   of time, making it appear separate from the branch of service they 
   are from.

   Providing DISA with a pool of namespaces for fine grained RPH 
   assignment(s) allows them the flexibility they need for their 
   mission requirements.  One can imagine due to their sheer size and 
   separation of purpose, they can easily utilize a significant number 
   of namespaces within their networks.  This is the reason for the 
   assignment of so many new namespaces, which seems to deviate from

   guidance in RFC 4412 to have a few namespaces as possible.  

   This document makes no changes to SIP, just adds IANA registered RPH
   namespaces for its use.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL

2.  New RPH Namespaces Created

   The following 50 SIP Resource Priority header namespaces are created
   by this document:

      dsn-000000      dsn-000010      dsn-000020      dsn-000030  
      dsn-000001      dsn-000011      dsn-000021      dsn-000031  
      dsn-000002      dsn-000012      dsn-000022                  
      dsn-000003      dsn-000013      dsn-000023                  
      dsn-000004      dsn-000014      dsn-000024                  
      dsn-000005      dsn-000015      dsn-000025                  
      dsn-000006      dsn-000016      dsn-000026                  
      dsn-000007      dsn-000017      dsn-000027                  
      dsn-000008      dsn-000018      dsn-000028                  
      dsn-000009      dsn-000019      dsn-000029                  
      dsn-00000A      dsn-00001A      dsn-00002A                  
      dsn-00000B      dsn-00001B      dsn-00002B                  
      dsn-00000C      dsn-00001C      dsn-00002C                  
      dsn-00000D      dsn-00001D      dsn-00002D                  
      dsn-00000E      dsn-00001E      dsn-00002E                  
      dsn-00000F      dsn-00001F      dsn-00002F                  

   Each namespace listed above is wholly different, unless one or more 
   sets of namespaces are aggregated according to the rules of section 
   8, within RFC 4412.  

   These aggregates of two or more namespaces, that are to be 
   considered equivalent during treatment, can be a set of any IANA 
   registered RPH namespaces, not just adjacent namespaces.











Polk                     Expires May 17th, 2008                [Page 3]
Internet-Draft       New SIP RPH Namespaces for DISA           Nov 2007

   Each namespace listed above will have the same 9 priority-levels:

      .0 (lowest priority)
      .1 
      .2 
      .3 
      .4 
      .5 
      .6 
      .7 
      .8 
      .9 (highest priority)

   According to the rules established in RFC 4412 [RFC4412], 
   priority-values have a relative order for preferential treatment, 
   unless one or more consecutive groups of priority-values are to be 
   considered equivalent (i.e., first-received, first treated).

   Thus, a message (or a call) with the following Resource-Priority 
   header value: 

      dsn-000001.8

   for example, MUST NOT ever receive preferential treatment over a 
   message, for example, with this Resource-Priority header value:

      dsn-000010.0

   because they are two difference namespaces, unless the namespaces 

      dsn-000001 and dsn-000010

   are configured as equivalent namespaces (according to section 8 of 
   RFC 4412).

   The dash '-' character is just like any other character, and is not 
   to be considered a delimiter in any official way within any 
   namespace here.  This MAY change in future efforts.

   As stated in Section 9 of RFC 4412 [RFC4412], an IANA registered 
   namespace SHOULD NOT change the number, and MUST NOT change the 
   relative priority order, of its assigned priority-values.


3.  IANA Considerations

   Abiding by the rules established within RFC 4412 [RFC4412], this is 
   a Standards-Track document registering new SIP Resource-Priority 
   header namespaces, and their associated priority-values and intended
   algorithms.
