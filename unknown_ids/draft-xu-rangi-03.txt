Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture           February, 2009 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

1. Introduction 

   The Default Free Zone (DFZ) routing table size has been growing at an 
   increasing and potentially alarming rate for several years, which has 
   detrimental impact on the routing system scalability and the routing 
   convergence performance. This so-called routing scalability issue has 
   drawn significant attention from both industry and academia. After 
   much discussion following the IAB Routing and Addressing workshop 
   [RAWS] in Amsterdam, a common conclusion was reached that the 
   explosive growth in the DFZ routing table is mainly caused by the 
   wide adoption of multi-homing, traffic engineering and provider-
   independent address. However, the underlying reason for this issue is 
   the overloading of IP address semantics of both identifiers and 
   locators. This overloading makes it impossible to renumber IP 
   addresses in a topologically aggregatable way.  

   At present, the IRTF Routing Research Group (RRG) is chartered to 
   explore a new routing and addressing architecture which is expected 
   to support the multi-homing, traffic-engineering, mobility and 
   simplified renumbering features in a more scalable way.  

   This document describes a new ID/locator split architecture, called 
   Routing Architecture for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI), which 
   aims to deal with the above issues. Similar with Host Identity 
   Protocol (HIP) [RFC4423], RANGI also introduces a host identifier (ID) 
   layer between the IPv6 network layer and the transport layer. As a 
   result, the transport-layer associations (e.g., TCP connections) are 
   no longer bound to IP addresses, but to the host IDs. Unlike HIP, 
   RANGI adopts hierarchical and cryptographic host IDs which have 
   delegation-oriented structure. As a result, the corresponding ID-
   >locator mapping system for such identifiers has a reasonable 
   business model and clear trust boundaries. In addition, RANGI uses 
   special IPv4-embeded IPv6 addresses as locators. With such locators, 
   not only site-controlled traffic-engineering and simplified 
   renumbering can be easily achieved, but also the deployment cost of 
   this new architecture is reduced greatly. 

2. Architecture Description 

   2.1. Host Identifiers 

   In RANGI, host IDs are hierarchical and 128-bit long. As depicted in 
   Figure 1, a host ID consists of two parts: the leftmost n bits (Note 
   that the suitable value of "n" has not been determined yet) part is 
   the Administrative Domain (AD) ID which has embedded organizational 
   affiliation and global uniqueness, and the remaining part (i.e., the

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture           February, 2009 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

   rightmost 128-n bits)is the Local Host ID which is generated by 
   computing a cryptographic one-way hash function from a public key of 
   the ID owner and auxiliary parameters, e.g., the ID owner's AD ID. 
   The binding between the public key and the host ID can be verified by 
   re-computing the hash value and by comparing the hash with the host 
   ID. As these identifiers are expected to be used along with IPv6 
   addresses at both applications and APIs, especially in the RANGI 
   transition mechanisms defined in [RANGI-PROXY], it is desired to 
   explicitly distinguish host IDs from IPv6 addresses (i.e., locators) 
   and vice versa. Hence, a separate prefix for identifiers should be 
   allocated by the IANA. As a result, several leftmost bits in the AD 
   ID field should be reserved to fill this dedicated prefix.

                    Figure 1. Host Identifier Structure 
                                      
   The approach of generating hierarchical RANGI host IDs is similar to 
   that for Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972]. The 
   major difference is that the prefix of the RANGI host ID is AD ID, 
   rather than ordinary IPv6 address prefix. In CGA, the process of 
   generating a new address takes three input values: a 64-bit subnet 
   prefix, the public key of the address owner as a DER-encoded ASN.1 
   structure of the type SubjectPublicKeyInfo and the security parameter 
   Sec, which is an unsigned three-bit integer. In contrast, the process 
   of generating a hierarchical host ID in RANGI also takes three input 
   values: the n-bit AD ID, the public key of the host ID owner and the 
   security parameter Sec. Therefore, if we set the value of n to 64, 
   host IDs can be compatible with CGAs. 
    
   The benefits of using hierarchical host IDs in RANGI include but not 
   limited to: 1) manage the global identifier namespace in a scalable 
   way; 2) hold a reasonable economic model and clear trust boundaries 
   in the corresponding ID->Locator mapping system; 3) ease the 
   transition from the current Internet to RANGI.

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture           February, 2009 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

    
   In RANGI, the global uniqueness of host IDs is guaranteed through 
   some registration mechanism. Since the AD IDs are globally unique and 
   owned by the corresponding host ID registration and administrative 
   authorities of different countries respectively, the Local Host IDs 
   are only required to be unique within the corresponding AD scope. 
    
   The resolution infrastructure for flat labels has no "pay-for-your-
   own" model, as names are stored at essentially random nodes (See 
   Layered Naming Architecture (LNA) [LNA]). In contrast, the resolution 
   infrastructure for hierarchical host IDs in RANGI has reasonable 
   business model and clear trust boundaries since host IDs can be 
   stored in the corresponding nodes according to their organizational 
   structures. To some extent, the business model of the ID->Locator 
   mapping system is similar with that for the Domain Name Service (DNS) 

   In the transition mechanisms for RANGI described in [RANGI-PROXY], 
   the identifiers of RANGI-aware hosts are treated as ordinary IPv6 
   addresses by legacy hosts. When a router receives a packet using a 
   host ID as the destination address, it needs to forward the packet 
   according to the destination IPv6 address as normal. In the end, the 
   packet will be forwarded to a dedicated proxy that is responsible for 
   translating the packets between RANGI and IPv6. Since the identifiers 
   are hierarchical and delegation-oriented aggregatable, such 
   identifier-based routing during transition period will not cause any 
   routing scalability issue. For more details, please refer to [RANGI-
   PROXY]. 

   2.2. Host Locators 

   The host locators in RANGI are ordinary IPv6 addresses. Since the 
   IPv4/IPv6 coexistence and transition will last for a long period, in 
   order to reduce the deployment cost of this new routing and 
   addressing architecture, RANGI uses specific IPv4-embeded IPv6 
   addresses as locators. As shown in Figure 2, the leftmost 96-bit part 
   of a locator is Locator Domain Identifier (LD ID), while the 
   rightmost 32-bit part is filled with an IPv4 address which is 
   required to be unique within the scope of corresponding LD. LD IDs 
   are used to globally identify each site network which is allowed to 
   adopt independent IPv4 address space (either public or private IPv4 
   addresses). Actually, LD IDs are Provider-Assigned (PA) /96 IPv6 
   prefixes which are topologically aggregatable in provider networks.

                     Figure 2. Host Locator Structure 
                                      
   Similar with the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol 
   (ISATAP) [RFC5214], this specific locator can be used for 
   automatically tunneling IPv6 packets over IPv4 networks.  
 
   2.3. Packet Formats 

   RANGI reuse the IPv6 packet format to maximum extent. The host IDs 
   are filled as options in the Destination Option Header, whereas the 
   locators are filled as IPv6 addresses in the IPv6 header. Packets 
   sent from a RANGI host can be protected by attaching the public key 
   and auxiliary parameters and by signing the packets with the 
   corresponding private key. The protection works without a 
   certification authority or any security infrastructure.  

   The details about the packet format and how to use IPsec to carry the 
   data traffic will be described in the latter version of this draft or 
   in a separate draft.   

   2.4. ID->Locator Mapping Resolution 

   ID/locator split implies a need for storing and distributing the 
   mappings from host IDs to locators. 

   In RANGI, the mappings from Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) to 
   host IDs are stored in the DNS system, while the mappings from host 
   IDs to locators are stored in a distributed ID->Locator mapping 
   system (e.g., a reverse DNS system). In a reverse DNS based mapping 
   infrastructure, If there are too many entries to be maintained by the 
   authoritative servers of a given Administrative Domain (AD), 
   Distribute Hash Table (DHT) technology can be used to make these 
   authoritative servers scale better. That is to say, the mappings 
   maintained by a given AD will be distributed among a group of 
   authoritative servers in a DHT fashion. As a result, the robustness 
   feature of DHT is inherited naturally into the ID->Locator mapping 
   system. Meanwhile, there is no trust issue since each AD authority 
   runs its own DHT ring which maintains only its presidial mappings.

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture           February, 2009 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

   A detailed lookup example is given as follows: 

   1. A host ID will be transformed to a FQDN format string. Firstly, a 
   host ID is expressed as "country-code.authority-code.region-
   code.local-host-ID" by inserting dots between adjacent fields, then 
   by reversing the fields and attaching with the 
   suffix "RANGI.EXAMPLE." it is transformed into a FQDN-format 
   string "local-host-ID.region-code.authority-code.country-
   code.RANGI.EXAMPLE." 

   2. The FQDN-format string is used as a key to locate the DNS server 
   or the DHT ring maintaining the desired resource records in the 
   reverse DNS infrastructure. If the DHT ring is located, the Local 
   Host ID part SHOULD be used as a key to locate the associated peer in 
   the DHT ring. 

   3. After an authoritative DNS server or a DHT peer has been located, 
   the Local Host ID is used to find out the related mapping entries for 
   that identifier. 

   In order to facilitate such a lookup process, a new sub-domain, 
   called "RANGI.EXAMPLE.", needs to be inserted into the current domain 
   name space tree structure. This domain can delegate its sub-domains 
   according to the hierarchy of the FQDN-format string of the host ID. 
   A new Resource Record (RR) named RANGI is also defined for the ID-
   >Locator mappings, in which the NAME field is filled with the FQDN-
   format string of a host ID, while the RDATA field is filled with the 
   corresponding locator information, including but not limited to an 
   IPv6 address (i.e., locator) and its preference, and so on.  

   The resolution infrastructure for flat names has no "pay-for-your-
   own" model, as the flat names are stored at essentially random nodes. 
   In contrast, the resolution infrastructure for hierarchical host IDs, 
   as used in RANGI, has reasonable business and trust models because 
   hierarchical host IDs have clear organization affiliation and they 
   can be allocated and managed with clear administrative boundaries. 

   To prevent the Man-in-the-Middle attacks during mapping lookups, the 
   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC535] is strongly recommended for 
   the origin authentication and integrity assurance of the DNS data. 

   To prevent DNS recursive servers caching antique ID->Locator mapping 
   information, the TTL of a RANGI RR for a mobile host should be set to 
   0 or a very small value. However, if a host (i.e., Correspondence 
   Node) wants to cache the RR of the communicating host (i.e., Mobile

   Node), it can reset the TTL of that RR to a reasonable value 
   internally. 

   The Secure DNS Dynamic Update mechanism defined in [RFC3007] is 
   directly used for dynamically updating the ID->Locator mapping 
   entries in the ID->Locator mapping system in a secure way. 

   2.5. Routing and Forwarding System 

   Within RANGI, LDs are connected via Locator Domain Border Routers 
   (LDBRs). A LDBR has at least one locally unique IPv4 address in each 
   LD to which it is connected. The adjacent LDBRs exchange LD ID or LD 
   prefix (Specific LD IDs can be aggregated into one LD prefix) 
   reachability information with an inter-LD routing protocol. In fact, 
   the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for IPv6 address family can be used 
   directly as the inter-LD routing protocol. 

   2.5.1. Host Behavior 

   Generally, a RANGI host needs to obtain the locator of the 
   destination host from the ID->Locator mapping system before 
   initiating a communication. If the communication parties share a same 
   LD ID, they can exchange packets directly over an IPv4 tunnel. 
   Otherwise, the traffic will be relayed by LDBRs through IPv4 tunnels. 

   Hosts can get the IPv4 addresses of their local LDBRs in several ways, 
   e.g., a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) option, or a 
   well-known LD-scope anycast address specific for LDBRs. 

   2.5.2. LDBR Behavior 

   LDBRs establish BGP sessions among them so as to exchange LD 
   reachability information (i.e., IPv6 routing information with the 
   mask length less than /96). LDBRs forward RANGI packets according to 
   the destination IPv6 addresses (i.e., locators) as normal.  

   2.5.3. Non-LDBR Behavior 

   The non-LDBRs just need to support IPv4 forwarding capability. So 
   there is no need to upgrade them. 

   2.5.4. Forwarding Procedures 

   RANGI introduces a two-level routing mechanism which is composed of 
   LD ID based routing and IPv4 address based routing. The former is

   used for inter-LD routing while the latter is used for intra-LD 
   routing.  

   A simple RANGI routing procedure is illustrated in Figure 3. Host A 
   (as source host) looks up the current locator of host B (as 
   destination host) through the ID->Locator mapping system. After 
   obtaining that information, host A will tunnel the packets with 
   destination address being host B to one of its local LDBRs. The LDBR 
   shall find the next-hop LDBR based on the IPv6 globally routable 
   locator, and forward the packets to it. For the intermediate transit 
   networks, if the Non-LDBR routers which the packets have to traverse 
   are legacy IPv4 routers, the ingress LDBR (for that locator domain) 
   forwards the packet to the egress LDBR of the same locator domain 
   over IPv4 tunnels.

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture           February, 2009 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

   In RANGI, IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnels are employed for intra-LD routing 
   between LDBRs (or between LDBRs and hosts). Hence, RANGI can achieve 
   a smooth IPv4/IPv6 transition. Once the internal routers within LDs 
   are upgraded to IPv6, the requirement of IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel 
   between the LDBRs or between LDBRs and hosts will be eliminated and 
   the packets will be delivered by the LDBRs and the internal IPv6 
   routers hop by hop without tunneling as shown in Figure 4.

   2.6. Site Multi-homing and Traffic-Engineering 

   In RANGI, Each multi-homed stub LD shall be assigned a LD ID by each 
   upstream ISP. In fact, these LD IDs are /96 IPv6 prefixes which are 
   topologically aggregatable in provider networks. Each Host within the 
   multi-homed site, in turn, has multiple locators by concatenating the 
   provider-assigned LD IDs with its locally unique IPv4 address. These 
   hosts register the mappings from their identifiers to locators with 
   the ID->Locator mapping system. As shown in Figure 5, host A which is 
   located in a multi-homed site, has two LD IDs, LD ID_1 and LD ID_2, 
   assigned separately from ISP1 and ISP2. Host A chooses either one as

   the source LD ID of the outgoing packets. Upon receiving the packets, 
   the site exit LDBR, BR1, implements source-based policy routing. For 
   example, if the source LD is LD ID_1, the packets will be forwarded 
   to the ISP1's network, otherwise, they will be forwarded to ISP2's 
   network.

   The site-controlled traffic-engineering works as follows: 

   1) The source host sends out packets with the source LD ID being one 
      of its LD IDs (assuming LD ID 1 being used). 

   2) The packets are intercepted by the LDBR BR1, and according to the 
      traffic-engineering policy, the source LD IDs of the packets may

Internet-Draft             Routing Architecture           February, 2009 
                   for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI)             
    

      be re-written from LD ID_1 to LD ID_2. Then BR1 forwards the 
      packets into ISP2's network according to source-based routing 
      policies. 

   3) Once the packets arrive at the destination host, that host will 
      use the source LD IDs in the received packets as the destination 
      LD IDs in the response packets. So the response packets will also 
      enter site A through ISP2's network.  

   4) The source host could accept this change and use LD ID 2 as source 
      LD ID in the subsequent packets. 

   Similar to the GSE [GSE], the site-controlled traffic-engineering by 
   rewriting the source LD ID will have effect on the path (upstream ISP) 
   selection for both the outgoing packets and the incoming packets. In 
   addition, the multi-homing and traffic-engineering usages in RANGI 
   will not cause any routing scalability issue.  

   2.7. Host Mobility and Multi-homing 

   To some extent, host multi-homing is similar with host mobility since 
   their effects on the network and on correspondents are identical.  

   In RANGI, when a host physically moves from one point of network 
   attachment to another in the event of mobility or re-homing, it 
   should inform its existing correspondents of its new locator as soon 
   as possible. Furthermore, it needs to update its locator information 
   in the ID->Locator mapping system through the Secure DNS Dynamic 
   Update mechanism [RFC3007] so that any new correspondent could 
   correctly initiate communications to it at its new locator. In case 
   of simultaneous mobility, at least one of the communicating entities 
   has to resort to the ID->Locator mapping system for resolving the 
   correspondence node's new locator so as to continue their 
   communication. 

   In order to allow legacy IPv6 hosts to initiate communicates to RANGI 
   mobile hosts, many home-agent like devices SHOULD be deployed in the 
   transit networks and each of them is dedicated to a bunch of 
   identifiers within a given AD scope and is responsible for 
   translating packets between IPv6 and RANGI. For more details, please 
   refer to the transit proxy mechanism defined in [RANGI-PROXY]. 

   2.8. Network Mobility 

   To mitigate the registration burden on the ID->Locator mapping system 
   triggered by network mobility, NEMO mechanism [RFC3963] is reused in

   RANGI to support network mobility. That is to say, the mobile router 
   is responsible for updating its locator on its home agent. As a 
   result, network mobility event is transparent to the hosts within 
   that mobile network. 

3. Summary 

   RANGI achieves almost all of goals set by RRG, which are listed as 
   follows: 

   1) Routing Scalability: Scalability is achieved by separating 
      identifiers from locators. Global routing is done based on 
      provider assigned locators. 

   2) Traffic Engineering: Site border router can overwrite the source 
      locator of the outgoing packets before performing source-based 
      policy routing. That is to say, hosts located in a multi-homed 
      site can suggest the upstream ISP for outbound and inbound 
      traffics, while the first-hop LDBR (i.e., site border router) has 
      the final decision right on the upstream ISP selection. 

   3) Mobility and Multi-homing: Applications and transport layers are 
      bound to host IDs and so the sessions will not be interrupted due 
      to locator change in cases of mobility or multi-homing. 

   4) Simplified Renumbering: When changing providers, the local IPv4       
      addresses of the site do not need to change. Hence the internal        
      routers within the site don't need renumbering. 

   5) Decoupling Location and Identifier: Obvious. 

   6) Routing Quality: Since LDBRs only exchange LD reachability and the 
      topology within LD will not be disclosed outside, the routing 
      stability is improved significantly. 

   7) Routing Security: RANGI reuses existing routing system and does 
      not introduce any new security risk into the routing system. 

   8) Incremental Deployability: The non-LDBRs (e.g., internal routers 
      within a site) can still be IPv4-only. Meanwhile, RANGI allows 
      easy transition from IPv4 networks to IPv6 networks. In addition, 
      the transition mechanisms for RANGI defined in [RANGI-PROXY] allow 
      RANGI hosts to initiate communications to legacy IPv4 or IPv6 
      hosts, and vice versa.

4. Security Considerations 

   TBD. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   A specific prefix for host IDs needs to be assigned from the IPv6 
   address space. 

   Two new options in the Destination Option Header need to be assigned 
   for the host ID and its corresponding parameter date structure 
   respectively.
