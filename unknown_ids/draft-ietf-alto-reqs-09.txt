       Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Requirements
                      draft-ietf-alto-reqs-09.txt

Abstract

   Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as
   pieces of information or server processes, which are available in
   several equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but
   is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal
   of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
   guidance to applications, which have to select one or several hosts
   from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired
   resource.  This guidance shall be based on parameters that affect
   performance and efficiency of the data transmission between the
   hosts, e.g., the topological distance.  The ultimate goal is to
   improve performance (or Quality of Experience) in the application
   while reducing resource consumption in the underlying network
   infrastructure.

   This document enumerates requirements for ALTO, which should be
   considered when specifying, assessing, or comparing protocols and
   implementations.

Internet-Draft              ALTO Requirements                   May 2011


1.  Introduction

   The motivation for Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is
   described in the ALTO problem statement [RFC5693].

   The goal of ALTO is to provide information which can help peer-to-
   peer (P2P) applications to make better decisions with respect to peer
   selection.  However, ALTO may be useful for non-P2P applications as
   well.  For example, clients of client-server applications may use
   information provided by ALTO to select one of several servers or
   information replicas.  As another example, ALTO information could be
   used to select a media relay needed for NAT traversal.  The goal of
   these informed decisions is to improve performance (or Quality of
   Experience) in the application while reducing resource consumption in
   the underlying network infrastructure.

   Usually, it would be difficult or even impossible for application
   entities to acquire this information by other mechanisms (e.g., using
   measurements between the peers of a P2P overlay), because of
   complexity or because it is based on network topology information,
   network operational costs, or network policies, which the respective
   network provider does not want to disclose in detail.

   The logical entities that provide the ALTO service do not take part
   in the actual user data transport, i.e., they do not implement
   functions for relaying user data.  They may be placed on various
   kinds of physical nodes, e.g., on dedicated servers, as auxiliary
   processes in routers, on "trackers" or "super peers" of a P2P
   application, etc.

2.  Terminology and Architectural Framework

2.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  ALTO Terminology

   This document uses the following ALTO-related terms, which are
   defined in [RFC5693]:

   Application, Peer, P2P, Resource, Resource Identifier, Resource
   Provider, Resource Consumer, Transport Address, Overlay Network,
   Resource Directory, ALTO Service, ALTO Server, ALTO Client, ALTO
   Query, ALTO Response, ALTO Transaction, Local Traffic, Peering
   Traffic, Transit Traffic, Application protocol, ALTO Client Protocol,
   Provisioning protocol.

   Furthermore, the following additional terms will be used:

   o  Host Group Descriptor: Information used to describe one or more
      Internet hosts (such as the resource consumer which seeks ALTO
      guidance, or one or more candidate resource providers) and their
      location within the network topology.  This can be, for example, a
      single IP address, an address prefix or address range that
      contains the host(s), or an autonomous system (AS) number.
      Different options may provide different levels of detail.
      Depending on the system architecture, this may have implications
      on the quality of the guidance ALTO is able to provide, on whether
      recommendations can be aggregated, and on how much privacy-
      sensitive information about users might be disclosed to additional
      parties.

   o  Host Characteristics Attribute: Properties of a host (other than
      the host group descriptor), in particular related to its
      attachment to the network.  This information may be stored in the
      ALTO server and transmitted in the ALTO protocol.  It may be
      evaluated according to the rating criteria.

   o  Rating Criterion: The condition or relation that defines the
      "better" in "better-than-random peer selection", which is the
      ultimate goal of ALTO.  Examples may include "host's Internet
      access is not subject to volume based charging (flat rate)" or
      "low topological distance".  Some rating criteria, such as "low
      topological distance", need to include a reference point, i. e.,
      "low topological distance from a given resource consumer", which

Internet-Draft              ALTO Requirements                   May 2011


      can be described by means of a host group descriptor.

2.3.  Architectural Framework for ALTO

   There are various architectural options for how ALTO could be
   implemented, and specifying or mandating one specific architecture is
   out of the scope of this document.

   The ALTO Working Group Charter [ALTO-charter] itemizes several key
   components, which shall be elaborated and specified by the ALTO
   Working Group.  The ALTO problem statement [RFC5693] defines a
   terminology (see Section 2.2) and presents a figure that gives a
   high-level overview of protocol interaction between ALTO elements.

   This document itemizes requirements for the following components and
   information elements that are part of the above-mentioned
   architecture:

   o  The ALTO client protocol, which is used for sending ALTO queries
      and ALTO responses between ALTO client and ALTO server.

   o  The discovery mechanism, which will be used by ALTO clients in
      order to find out where to send ALTO requests.

   o  The overall architecture, especially with respect to security and
      privacy issues.

   o  Host group descriptors, which are used to describe the location of
      a host in the network topology.

   o  Rating criteria, i. e., conditions or relations that shall be
      evaluated in order to generate the ALTO guidance.

3.  ALTO Requirements

3.1.  ALTO Client Protocol

3.1.1.  General Requirements

   REQ.  ARv09-1: The ALTO service is provided by one or more ALTO
   servers.  ALTO servers MUST implement the ALTO client protocol, for
   receiving ALTO queries from ALTO clients and for sending the
   corresponding ALTO responses.

   REQ.  ARv09-2: ALTO clients MUST implement the ALTO client protocol,
   for sending ALTO queries to ALTO servers and for receiving the
   corresponding ALTO responses.

   REQ.  ARv09-3: The format of the ALTO query message MUST allow the
   ALTO client to solicit guidance for selecting appropriate resource
   providers.

   REQ.  ARv09-4: The format of the ALTO response message MUST allow the
   ALTO server to express its guidance for selecting appropriate
   resource providers.

   REQ.  ARv09-5: The detailed specification of a protocol is out of the
   scope of this document.  However, any protocol specification that
   claims to implement the ALTO client protocol MUST be compliant to the
   requirements itemized in this document.

3.1.2.  Host Group Descriptor Support

   The ALTO guidance is based on the evaluation of several resource
   providers or groups of resource providers, which are characterized by
   means of host group descriptors, considering one or more rating
   criteria.

   REQ.  ARv09-6: The ALTO client protocol MUST support the host group
   descriptor types "IPv4 address prefix" and "IPv6 address prefix".
   They can be used to specify the IP address of one host, or an IP
   address range (in CIDR notation), which contains all hosts in
   question.  It is also possible to specify a broader address range
   (i.e., a shorter prefix length) than the intended group of hosts
   actually uses, in order to conceal their exact identity.

   REQ.  ARv09-7: The ALTO client protocol MUST be extensible to enable
   support of other host group descriptor types in future.  The ALTO
   client protocol specification MUST define an appropriate procedure
   for adding new host group descriptor types, e.g., by establishing an
   IANA registry.

Internet-Draft              ALTO Requirements                   May 2011


   REQ.  ARv09-8: ALTO clients and ALTO servers MUST clearly identify
   the type of each host group descriptor sent in ALTO queries or
   responses.

   REQ.  ARv09-9: For host group descriptor types other than "IPv4
   address prefix" and "IPv6 address prefix", the host group descriptor
   type identification MUST be supplemented by a reference to a
   facility, which can be used to translate host group descriptors of
   that type to IPv4/IPv6 address prefixes, e.g., by means of a mapping
   table or an algorithm.

   REQ.  ARv09-10: Protocol functions for mapping other host group
   descriptor types to IPv4/IPv6 address prefixes SHOULD be designed and
   specified as part of the ALTO client protocol, and the corresponding
   address mapping information SHOULD be made available by the same
   entity that wants to use these host group descriptors within the ALTO
   client protocol.  However, an ALTO server or an ALTO client MAY also
   send a reference to an external mapping facility, e.g., a translation
   table to be downloaded as file via HTTP.

   REQ.  ARv09-11: The ALTO client protocol specification MUST define
   mechanisms, which can be used by the ALTO server to indicate that a
   host group descriptor used by the ALTO client is of an unsupported
   type, or that the indicated mapping mechanism could not be used.

   REQ.  ARv09-12: The ALTO client protocol specification MUST define
   mechanisms, which can be used by the ALTO client to indicate that a
   host group descriptor used by the ALTO server is of an unsupported
   type, or that the indicated mapping mechanism could not be used.

3.1.3.  Rating Criteria Support

   REQ.  ARv09-13: The ALTO client protocol specification MUST define a
   rating criterion that can be used to express and evaluate the
   "relative operator's preference."  This is a relative measure, i.e.,
   it is not associated with any unit of measurement.  A more-preferred
   rating according to this criterion indicates that the application
   should prefer the respective candidate resource provider over others
   with less-preferred ratings (unless information from non-ALTO sources
   suggests a different choice, such as transmission attempts suggesting
   that the path is currently congested).  The operator of the ALTO
   server does not have to disclose how and based on which data the
   ratings are actually computed.  Examples could be: cost for peering
   or transit traffic, traffic engineering inside the network, and other
   policies.

   REQ.  ARv09-14: The ALTO client protocol MUST be extensible to enable
   support of other rating criteria types in future.  The ALTO client

Internet-Draft              ALTO Requirements                   May 2011


   protocol specification MUST define an appropriate procedure for
   adding new rating criteria types, e.g., by establishing an IANA
   registry.

   REQ.  ARv09-15: The ALTO client protocol specification MUST define an
   appropriate procedure for adding new rating criteria types, e.g., by
   establishing an IANA registry.

   REQ.  ARv09-16: ALTO client protocol specifications MUST NOT define
   rating criteria closely related to the instantaneous network
   congestion state, whose primary aim is to serve an alternative to
   established congestion control strategies, such as using TCP-based
   transport.

      One design assumption for ALTO is that it is acceptable that the
      host characteristics attributes, which are stored and processed in
      the ALTO servers for giving the guidance, are updated rather
      infrequently.  Typical update intervals may be several orders of
      magnitude longer than the typical network-layer packet round-trip
      time (RTT).  Therefore, ALTO cannot be a replacement for TCP-like
      congestion control mechanisms.  The definition of alternate
      approaches for congestion control is explicitly a non-goal for the
      ALTO working group [ALTO-charter].

   REQ.  ARv09-17: Applications using ALTO guidance MUST NOT rely on the
   ALTO guidance to avoid network congestion.  Instead, applications
   MUST use other appropriate means, such as TCP based transport, to
   avoid causing excessive congestion.

   REQ.  ARv09-18: The ALTO query message SHOULD allow the ALTO client
   to express which rating criteria should be considered, as well as
   their relative relevance for the specific application that will
   eventually make use of the guidance.

   REQ.  ARv09-19: The ALTO response message SHOULD allow the ALTO
   server to express which rating criteria have been considered when
   generating the response.

   REQ.  ARv09-20: The ALTO client protocol specification MUST define
   mechanisms, which can be used by the ALTO client and the ALTO server
   to indicate that a rating criteria used by the other party is of an
   unsupported type.

3.1.4.  Placement of Entities and Timing of Transactions

   With respect to the placement of ALTO clients, several modes of
   operation exist:




Kiesel, et al.          Expires November 11, 2011               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              ALTO Requirements                   May 2011


   o  One mode of ALTO operation is that an ALTO client may be embedded
      directly in the resource consumer, i.e., the application protocol
      entity that will eventually initiate data transmission to/from the
      selected resource provider(s) in order to access the desired
      resource.  For example, an ALTO client could be integrated into
      the peer of a P2P application that uses a distributed algorithm
      such as "query flooding" for resource discovery.

   o  Another mode of operation is to integrate the ALTO client into a
      third party such as a resource directory, which may issue ALTO
      queries to solicit preference on potential resource providers,
      considering the respective resource consumer.  For example, an
      ALTO client could be integrated into the tracker of a tracker-
      based P2P application, in order to request ALTO guidance on behalf
      of the peers contacting the tracker.

   REQ.  ARv09-21: The ALTO client protocol MUST support the mode of
   operation in which the ALTO client is directly embedded in the
   resource consumer.

   REQ.  ARv09-22: The ALTO client protocol MUST support the mode of
   operation in which the ALTO client is embedded in a third party,
   which performs queries on behalf of resource consumers.

   REQ.  ARv09-23: The ALTO client protocol MUST be designed in a way
   that the ALTO service can be provided by an entity which is not the
   operator of the underlying IP network.

   REQ.  ARv09-24: The ALTO client protocol MUST be designed in a way
   that different instances of the ALTO service operated by different
   providers can coexist.

   With respect to the timing of ALTO queries, several modes of
   operation exist:

   o  In target-aware query mode, an ALTO client performs the ALTO query
      when the desired resource and a set of candidate resource
      providers are already known, i. e., after DHT lookups, queries to
      the resource directory, etc.

   o  In target-independent query mode, ALTO queries are performed in
      advance or periodically, in order to receive comprehensive,
      "target-independent" guidance, which will be cached locally and
      evaluated later, when a resource is to be accessed.

   REQ.  ARv09-25: The ALTO client protocol MUST support at least one of
   these two modes, either the target-aware or the target-independent
   query mode.

Internet-Draft              ALTO Requirements                   May 2011


   REQ.  ARv09-26: The ALTO client protocol SHOULD support both the
   target-aware and the target-independent query mode.

   REQ.  ARv09-27: The ALTO client protocol SHOULD support TTL (time-to-
   live) attributes or similar mechanisms, to enable caching of
   recommendations at ALTO clients.

   REQ.  ARv09-28: The ALTO client protocol SHOULD specify an aging
   mechanism, which allows to give newer recommendations precedence over
   older ones.

   REQ.  ARv09-29: The ALTO client protocol SHOULD allow the ALTO server
   to add information about appropriate modes of re-use to its ALTO
   responses.  Re-use may include redistributing an ALTO response to
   other parties, as well as using the same ALTO information in a
   resource directory to improve the responses to different resource
   consumers, within the specified lifetime of the ALTO response.  The
   ALTO server SHOULD be able to express that

   o  no re-use should occur

   o  re-use is appropriate for a specific "target audience", i.e., a
      set of resource consumers explicitly defined by a list of host
      group descriptors.  The ALTO server MAY specify a "target
      audience" in the ALTO response, which is only a subset of the
      known actual "target audience", e.g., if required by operator
      policies

   o  re-use is appropriate for any resource consumer that would send
      (or cause a third party sending on behalf of it) the same ALTO
      query (i.e., with the same query parameters, except for the
      resource consumer ID, if applicable) to this ALTO server

   o  re-use is appropriate for any resource consumer that would send
      (or cause a third party sending on behalf of it) the same ALTO
      query (i.e., with the same query parameters, except for the
      resource consumer ID, if applicable) to any other ALTO server,
      which was discovered (using an ALTO discovery mechanism) together
      with this ALTO server

   o  re-use is appropriate for any resource consumer that would send
      (or cause a third party sending on behalf of it) the same ALTO
      query (i.e., with the same query parameters, except for the
      resource consumer ID, if applicable) to any ALTO server in the
      whole network

   REQ.  ARv09-30: The ALTO client protocol MUST support scenarios with
   the ALTO client located in the private address realm behind a network

   address translator (NAT).  There are different types of NAT, see
   [RFC4787] and [RFC5382].

3.1.5.  Protocol Extensibility

   REQ.  ARv09-31: The ALTO client protocol MUST include support for
   adding protocol extensions in a non-disruptive, backward-compatible
   way.

   REQ.  ARv09-32: The ALTO client protocol MUST include protocol
   versioning support, in order to clearly distinguish between
   incompatible versions of the protocol.

3.1.6.  Error Handling and Overload Protection

   REQ.  ARv09-33: The ALTO client protocol MUST use TCP based
   transport.

   REQ.  ARv09-34: An ALTO server, which is operating close to its
   capacity limit, MUST be able to inform clients about its impending
   overload situation, and require them to throttle their query rate.

   REQ.  ARv09-35: An ALTO server, which is operating close to its
   capacity limit, MUST be able to inform clients about its impending
   overload situation, and redirect them to another ALTO server.

   REQ.  ARv09-36: An ALTO server, which is operating close to its
   capacity limit, MUST be able to inform clients about its impending
   overload situation, and terminate the conversation with the ALTO
   client.

3.2.  ALTO Server Discovery

   The ALTO client protocol is supported by one or more ALTO server
   discovery mechanisms, which may be used by ALTO clients in order to
   determine one or more ALTO servers to which ALTO requests can be
   sent.

   REQ.  ARv09-37: ALTO clients which are embedded in the resource
   consumer MUST be able to use an ALTO server discovery mechanism, in
   order to find one or several ALTO servers that can provide ALTO
   guidance suitable for the resource consumer.  This mode of operation
   is called "resource consumer initiated ALTO server discovery".

   REQ.  ARv09-38: ALTO clients which are embedded in a resource
   directory and perform third-party ALTO queries on behalf of a remote
   resource consumer MUST be able to use an ALTO server discovery
   mechanism, in order to find one or several ALTO servers that can

   provide ALTO guidance suitable for the respective resource consumer.
   This mode of operation is called "third-party ALTO server discovery".

   REQ.  ARv09-39: ALTO clients MUST be able to perform resource
   consumer initiated ALTO server discovery, even if they are located
   behind a network address translator (NAT).

   REQ.  ARv09-40: ALTO clients MUST be able to perform third-party ALTO
   server discovery, even if they are located behind a network address
   translator (NAT).

   REQ.  ARv09-41: ALTO clients MUST be able to perform third-party ALTO
   server discovery, even if the resource consumer, on behalf of which
   the ALTO query will be sent, is located behind a network address
   translator (NAT).

   REQ.  ARv09-42: ALTO server discovery mechanisms SHOULD leverage an
   existing protocol or mechanism, such as DNS, DHCP, or PPP based
   automatic configuration, etc.  A single mechanism with a broad
   spectrum of applicability SHOULD be preferred over several different
   mechanisms with narrower scopes.

   REQ.  ARv09-43: Every ALTO server discovery mechanism SHOULD be able
   to return the respective contact information for multiple ALTO
   servers.

   REQ.  ARv09-44: Every ALTO server discovery mechanism SHOULD be able
   to indicate preferences for each returned ALTO server contact
   information.

3.3.  Security and Privacy

   REQ.  ARv09-45: The ALTO client protocol specification MUST specify
   mechanisms for the authentication of ALTO servers, or how to leverage
   appropriate mechanisms provided by underlying protocol layers.

   REQ.  ARv09-46: The ALTO client protocol specification MUST specify
   mechanisms for the authentication of ALTO clients, or how to leverage
   appropriate mechanisms provided by underlying protocol layers.

   REQ.  ARv09-47: The ALTO client protocol specification MUST specify
   mechanisms for the encryption of messages, or how to leverage
   appropriate mechanisms provided by underlying protocol layers.

   REQ.  ARv09-48: The ALTO client protocol MUST support different
   levels of detail in queries and responses, in order for the operator
   of an ALTO service to be able to control how much information (e.g.,
   about the network topology) is disclosed.

Internet-Draft              ALTO Requirements                   May 2011


   REQ.  ARv09-49: The operator of an ALTO server MUST NOT assume that
   an ALTO client will implement mechanisms or comply with rules that
   limit the ALTO client's ability to redistribute information retrieved
   from the ALTO server to third parties.

   REQ.  ARv09-50: The ALTO client protocol MUST support different
   levels of detail in queries and responses, in order to protect the
   privacy of users, to ensure that the operators of ALTO servers and
   other users of the same application cannot derive sensitive
   information.

   REQ.  ARv09-51: The ALTO client protocol SHOULD be defined in a way,
   that the operator of one ALTO server cannot easily deduce the
   resource identifier (e.g., file name in P2P file sharing) which the
   resource consumer seeking ALTO guidance wants to access.

   REQ.  ARv09-52: The ALTO client protocol MUST support appropriate
   mechanisms to protect the ALTO service against DoS attacks.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  High-level security considerations

   High-level security considerations for the ALTO service can be found
   in the "Security Considerations" section of the ALTO problem
   statement document [RFC5693].

5.2.  Information Disclosure Scenarios

   The unwanted disclosure of information is one key concern related to
   ALTO.  This section presents a classification and discussion of
   information disclosure scenarios and potential countermeasures.

5.2.1.  Classification of Information Disclosure Scenarios

   o  (1) Excess disclosure of ALTO server operator's data to an
      authorized ALTO client.  The operator of an ALTO server has to
      feed information, such as tables mapping host group descriptors to
      host characteristics attributes, into the server, thereby enabling
      it to give guidance to ALTO clients.  Some operators might
      consider the full set of this information confidential (e.g., a
      detailed map of the operator's network topology), and might want
      to disclose only a subset of it or somehow obfuscated information
      to an ALTO client.

   o  (2) Disclosure of the application behavior to the ALTO server.
      The operator of an ALTO server could infer the application
      behavior (e.g., content identifiers in P2P file sharing
      applications, or lists of resource providers that are considered
      for establishing a connection) from the ALTO queries sent by an
      ALTO client.

   o  (3) Disclosure of ALTO server operator's data (e.g., network
      topology information) to an unauthorized third party.  There are a
      three sub-cases here:

      *  (3a) An ALTO server sends the information directly to an
         unauthorized ALTO client.

      *  (3b) An unauthorized party snoops on the data transmission from
         the ALTO server to an authorized ALTO client.

      *  (3c) An authorized ALTO client knowingly forwards the
         information it had received from the ALTO server to an
         unauthorized party.

Internet-Draft              ALTO Requirements                   May 2011


   o  (4) Disclosure of the application behavior to an unauthorized
      third party.

   o  (5) Excess retrieval of ALTO server operator's data by
      collaborating ALTO clients.  Several authorized ALTO clients could
      ask an ALTO server for guidance, and redistribute the responses
      among each other (see also case 3c).  By correlating the ALTO
      responses they could find out more information than intended to be
      disclosed by the ALTO server operator.

5.2.2.  Discussion of Information Disclosure Scenarios

   Scenario (1) may be addressed by the ALTO server operator choosing
   the level of detail of the information to be populated into the ALTO
   server.  Furthermore, access control mechanisms for filtering ALTO
   responses according to the authenticated ALTO client identity might
   be installed in the ALTO server, although this might not be effective
   given the lack of efficient mechanisms for addressing (3c) and (5),
   see below.

   (2) can and needs to be addressed in several ways: If the ALTO client
   is embedded in the resource consumer, the resource consumer's IP
   address (or the "public" IP address of the outermost NAT in front of
   the resource consumer) is disclosed to the ALTO server as a matter of
   principle, because it is in the source address fields of the IP
   headers.  By using a proxy, the disclosure of source addresses to the
   ALTO server can be avoided at the cost of disclosing them to said
   proxy.  If, in contrast, the ALTO client is embedded in a third party
   (e.g., a resource directory) which issues ALTO requests on behalf of
   resource consumers, it is possible to hide the exact addresses of the
   resource consumers from the ALTO server, e.g., by zeroing-out or
   randomizing the last few bits of the IP addresses.  However, there is
   the potential side effect of yielding inaccurate results.

   The disclosure of candidate resource providers' addresses to the ALTO
   server can be avoided by allowing ALTO clients to use the target-
   independent query mode.  In this mode of operation, guiding
   information (e.g., "maps") is retrieved from the ALTO server and used
   entirely locally by the ALTO client, i.e., without sending host
   location attributes of candidate resource providers to the ALTO
   server.  In the target-aware query mode, this issue can be addressed
   by ALTO clients by obfuscating the identity of candidate resource
   consumers, e.g., by zeroing-out or randomizing the last few bits of
   the IP addresses.  However, there is the potential side effect of
   yielding inaccurate results.

   (3a), (3b), and (4) may be addressed by authentication, access
   control, and encryption schemes for the ALTO client protocol.

Internet-Draft              ALTO Requirements                   May 2011


   However, deployment of encryption schemes might not be effective
   given the lack of efficient mechanisms for addressing (3c) and (5),
   see below.

   Straightforward authentication and encryption schemes will not help
   solving (3c) and (5), and there is no other simple and efficient
   mechanism known.  The cost of complex approaches, e.g., based on
   digital rights management (DRM), might easily outweigh the benefits
   of the whole ALTO solution, and therefore they are not considered as
   a viable solution.  That is, ALTO server operators must be aware that
   (3c) and (5) cannot be prevented from happening, and therefore they
   should feed only such data into an ALTO server, which they do not
   consider sensitive with respect to (3c) and (5).

   These insights are reflected in the requirements in this document.
