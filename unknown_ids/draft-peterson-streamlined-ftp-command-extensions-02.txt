Internet-Draft    Streamlined FTP Command Extensions         April 2008 
    

   This document specifies FTP commands to download thumbnails of remote 
   images, remove entire directory trees, request the amount of storage 
   space available to the user, request the size of a remote directory 
   and its contents, and to specify an FTP host.  The commands are 
   designed to reduce the number of server / client exchanges, provide 
   information that was not previously available, and to reduce 
   bandwidth requirements for some higher level operations. 

Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

   This document uses previously established definitions for FTP related 
   terms as defined in [RFC959].  In particular, the terms "data 
   connection", "FTP command", "file", "pathname", "reply", "server-FTP 
   process", "user", and "user-FTP process" are used as defined.  The 
   terms "server" and "client" are also used in place of "server-FTP 
   process" and "user-FTP process", respectively, for the sake of 
   brevity. 

   The syntax for responses to FTP commands used in this document is 
   explained using Augmented BNF as defined in [RFC5234].  Additional 
   tokens defined in [RFC3659] that extend ABNF are also used, 
   specifically the TCHAR token. 

   In command examples, "C>" and "S>" indicate lines sent by the client 
   and server, respectively.

1. Introduction 

   This document updates the File Transfer Protocol [RFC959].  It adds 
   five new commands: "RMDA", "DSIZ", "AVBL", "HOST", and "THMB".  The 
   "HOST" command has been used in various forms for several years while 
   the other four commands are new.  These commands have been designed 
   to streamline certain client and server communications, reduce the 
   amount of bandwidth required to perform various operations, and allow 
   a server-FTP process to operate multiple hosts on the same IP address 
   and port combination. 

2. Remove Directory All (RMDA) 

   The FTP command REMOVE DIRECTORY ALL (RMDA) removes a directory from 
   the server and all of its contents including all files and 
   subdirectories.  The RMDA command is considered analogous to 
   recursively deleting all files and directories contained in a given 
   remote directory (including the directory itself) one at a time. 

   The primary advantage to using this command is the elimination of the 
   additional commands usually required to perform the equivalent 
   action.  For directories containing a large number of files and 
   subdirectories, using RMDA eliminates the overhead of querying for 
   subdirectory listings.  The end result is a more responsive operation 
   for both the client and server.

Internet-Draft    Streamlined FTP Command Extensions         April 2008 
    

   Depending on the content being deleted (files and subdirectories) 
   this can be a very lengthy operation for the server.  Servers that 
   implement this command are encouraged to do so in a way that does not 
   block operations for other client connections. 

2.1. RMDA Syntax 

   The syntax of the RMDA command is: 

      rmda           = "RMDA" SP pathname CRLF 

   All FTP commands, including RMDA, are case insensitive.  However, the 
   "pathname" variable provided with the command may be case sensitive 
   as dictated by the server's operating system. 

   The "pathname" specifies a remote directory that should be deleted 
   along with all of its contents. 

      rmda-response  = "250" SP *TCHAR CRLF / 
                        error-response 

   Responses should be the same as those for the RMD command.  If 
   processing fails at any point during the operation, the specified 
   pathname is not to be removed.  Any cached information about the 
   pathname is considered invalid when RMDA returns an error. 

2.2. RMDA Error Responses 

   The RMDA command can return any error response listed for the RMD 
   command in [RFC959].  The most common of these responses occurs in 
   the event of an error while deleting a file or subdirectory, in which 
   case the server should return a 550 reply.  A 550 reply should also 
   be sent if the provided path is a file instead of a directory. 

   In the event that a nested file or subdirectory cannot be deleted for 
   any reason, the parent directories of that file or subdirectory 
   should not be deleted.  When the server encounters this situation, it 
   should attempt to delete all other files and subdirectories before 
   stopping or responding to the client.  Once the server has attempted 
   to delete all files and subdirectories, the server MUST report 
   failure to the client if even a single file or subdirectory could not 
   be deleted. 

2.3. RMDA FEAT Response 

   When replying to the FEAT command, a server-FTP process that supports 
   the RMDA command MUST include a line starting with the word "RMDA".

Internet-Draft    Streamlined FTP Command Extensions         April 2008 
    

   If descriptive text is optionally desired, a space MUST immediately 
   follow the "RMDA" word.  

      C> FEAT 
      S> 211- <any descriptive text> 
      S>  ... 
      S>  RMDA <any descriptive text> 
      S>  ... 
      S> 211 End 

   The ellipses indicate placeholders where other features may be 
   included, and are not required.  The one space indentation of the 
   feature lines is mandatory per [RFC2389]. 

2.4. RMDA Examples 

   This example assumes that the server contains a directory named "A" 
   and that the client has the necessary access to delete "A" and its 
   contents.  The client-server exchange for using RMDA to accomplish 
   this would be: 

      C> RMDA A 
      S> 250 RMDA command successful. 

   If deletion of the directory, any contained file, or subdirectory 
   fails the client-server exchange would be: 

      C> RMDA A 
      S> 550 A: Cannot delete directory. 

   If deletion fails due to inadequate permissions for the directory, 
   any contained file, or subdirectory for the connected client, the 
   client-server exchange would be: 

      C> RMDA A 
      S> 550 A: Permission denied. 

3. Directory Size (DSIZ) 

   The FTP command DIRECTORY SIZE (DSIZ) returns the number of octets 
   (8-bit bytes) on the remote file system occupied by a given directory 
   and its contents.  The parameter to this command MUST represent a 
   directory path, not a file path. 

   While a method already exists to retrieve similar information by 
   recursively issuing the SIZE command as defined in [RFC3659] and 
   tallying the results, the SIZE command returns the number of transfer 
 
 
Peterson & Papenthien  Expires October 8, 2008                 [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft    Streamlined FTP Command Extensions         April 2008 
    

   octets for a specified file, which means that it considers the 
   current data representation type in its calculated response.  The 
   DSIZ command should not consider this in its response, instead 
   leaving it up to the underlying file system to determine the number 
   of octets occupied by the files. 

   In addition, issuing a single DSIZ command saves on the number of 
   required commands and the overhead associated with recursively 
   querying for the SIZE of each individual file.  This results in a 
   more responsive and conservative communication exchange between the 
   client and server. 

   Depending on the size of the path being queried and its location 
   relative to the server, this can be a very lengthy operation.  
   Servers that implement this command are encouraged to do so in a way 
   that does not block operations for other client connections. 

3.1. DSIZ Syntax 

   The syntax of the DSIZ command is: 

      dsiz           = "DSIZ" [SP pathname] CRLF 

   All FTP commands, including DSIZ, are case insensitive.  However, the 
   "pathname" variable provided with the command may be case sensitive 
   as dictated by the server's operating system.  If the "pathname" 
   variable is not present in the received DSIZ command, its value is 
   assumed to be the current directory (i.e., the path that would be 
   returned in response to a Print Working Directory (PWD) command). 

   The "pathname" specifies a remote directory that should be queried to 
   retrieve the total storage space occupied by its contents on the 
   server's file system.  The "pathname" MUST be a valid directory path; 
   it cannot be a path to a file or a system device. 

      dsiz-response  = "213" SP 1*DIGIT CRLF / 
                        error-response 

   The 213 reply is formatted in such a way that the returned size value 
   can be machine parsed. 

   A successful response includes a numeric value indicating the number 
   of octets on the server's file system occupied by the provided 
   pathname and its contents.

Internet-Draft    Streamlined FTP Command Extensions         April 2008 
    

3.2. DSIZ Error Responses 

   In the event that the pathname is not a directory, the server MUST 
   return a permanent 550 error reply.  Where the command cannot be 
   parsed, a 500 or 501 reply SHOULD be sent.  The client MUST NOT 
   assume that the presence of a 550 reply indicates that it cannot 
   access the directory or its contents.  The server may generate this 
   error for other reasons, for example the overhead required for the 
   operation is too great. 

3.3. DSIZ FEAT Response 

   When replying to the FEAT command, a server-FTP process that supports 
   the DSIZ command MUST include a line starting with the word "DSIZ".  
   If descriptive text is optionally desired, a space MUST immediately 
   follow the "DSIZ" word.  

      C> FEAT 
      S> 211- <any descriptive text> 
      S>  ... 
      S>  DSIZ <any descriptive text> 
      S>  ... 
      S> 211 End 

   The ellipses indicate placeholders where other features may be 
   included, and are not required.  The one space indentation of the 
   feature lines is mandatory per [RFC2389]. 

3.4. DSIZ Examples 

   Assuming the presence of directory "A" on the server and that the 
   client has the necessary permissions to access and list it, a typical 
   DSIZ client-server exchange would be: 

      C> DSIZ A 
      S> 213 123456 

   Where 123456 is the number of octets on the server's file system 
   occupied by the directory "A" and its contents. 

   Assuming directory "A" cannot be listed due to client permissions, 
   the client-server exchange would be: 

      C> DSIZ A 
      S> 550 A: Permission denied.

Internet-Draft    Streamlined FTP Command Extensions         April 2008 
    

   Assuming the client provides the parameter "file.fid" where 
   "file.fid" is an existing file, the client-server exchange would be: 

      C> DSIZ file.fid 
      S> 550 A: Is a file. 

4. Available Octets (AVBL) 

   The FTP command AVAILABLE OCTETS (AVBL) can be used to retrieve the 
   number of octets available to receive uploads in a specified remote 
   directory.  Many server-FTP processes have implemented proprietary 
   methods for restricting the amount of space available, either to the 
   user as a whole or within a specified remote location.  The AVBL 
   command offers an interface for retrieving this value in a way that 
   can be machine parsed. 

4.1. AVBL Syntax 

   The syntax of the AVBL command is: 

      avbl           = "AVBL" [SP pathname] CRLF 

   All FTP commands, including AVBL, are case insensitive.  However, the 
   optional "pathname" variable provided with the command may be case 
   sensitive as dictated by the server's operating system.  If the 
   "pathname" variable is not present in the received AVBL command, its 
   value is assumed to be the current directory (i.e., the path that 
   would be returned in response to a Print Working Directory (PWD) 
   command). 

   The "pathname" variable specifies the remote directory that the 
   client wants to know how many octets are available to the user for 
   uploads.  The "pathname" MUST be a valid directory path; it cannot be 
   a path to a file or a system device. 

      avbl-response  = "213" SP 1*DIGIT CRLF / 
                        error-response 

   The 213 reply is formatted in such a way that the returned size can 
   be machine parsed. 

   A successful response includes a numeric value that may be the number 
   of octets available as dictated by the physical limitations of the 
   underlying storage mechanism.  It may also be a limit imposed upon 
   "pathname" or even the user that issued the command.  The exact 
   method for calculating this numeric value is up to the specific 
   server-FTP process implementation.

Internet-Draft    Streamlined FTP Command Extensions         April 2008 
    

4.2. AVBL Error Responses 

   In the event that the pathname is not a directory, the server MUST 
   return a permanent 550 error reply.  Where the command cannot be 
   parsed, a 500 or 501 reply should be sent.  The client MUST NOT 
   assume that the presence of a 550 reply indicates that it cannot 
   access the directory or its contents.  The server may generate this 
   error for other reasons, for example the overhead required for the 
   operation is too great. 

4.3. AVBL FEAT Response 

   When replying to the FEAT command, a server-FTP process that supports 
   the AVBL command MUST include a line starting with the word "AVBL".  
   If descriptive text is optionally desired, a space MUST immediately 
   follow the "AVBL" word.  

      C> FEAT 
      S> 211- <any descriptive text> 
      S>  ... 
      S>  AVBL <any descriptive text> 
      S>  ... 
      S> 211 End 

   The ellipses indicate placeholders where other features may be 
   included, and are not required.  The one space indentation of the 
   feature lines is mandatory per [RFC2389]. 

4.4. AVBL Examples 

   A typical client-server exchange using the AVBL command may look like 
   this: 

      C> AVBL 
      S> 213 123456 
    
   Where 123456 is the number of octets the user has available for file 
   uploads.  In this example, no pathname is provided with the AVBL 
   command.  Therefore, the server has used the current working 
   directory when processing its response. 

   Assuming the presence of directory "A" on the server and that the 
   client has the necessary permissions to access and list it: 

      C> AVBL A 
      S> 213 123456

Internet-Draft    Streamlined FTP Command Extensions         April 2008 
    

   Assuming directory "A" cannot be listed due to client permissions, 
   the client-server exchange would be: 

      C> AVBL A 
      S> 550 A: Permission denied. 

   Assuming the client provides the parameter "file.fid" where 
   "file.fid" is an existing file, the client-server exchange would be: 

      C> AVBL file.fid 
      S> 550 A: Is a file. 

    
5. Change Host (HOST) 

   The FTP command CHANGE HOST (HOST) allows the client to identify the 
   name used to connect to the server.  This command allows the server 
   to host many unique domains within the server-FTP process that make 
   use of the same IP address and port number combination, much like the 
   "Host" header field of the HTTP protocol as defined in [RFC2616] 
   allows a web server to do the same. 

5.1. HOST Syntax 

   The syntax of the HOST command is: 

      host           = "HOST" SP host_name CRLF 

   All FTP commands, including HOST, are case insensitive.  The 
   specified "host_name" is also case insensitive to provide 
   compatibility with domain names, which are case insensitive as well 
   [RFC1035]. 

   The "host_name" parameter can be any arbitrary text that uniquely 
   identifies the client's desired domain to the server-FTP process.  
   The most common and appropriate application of a "host_name" would be 
   to specify a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) as this meets the 
   criteria of being unique.  However, by not restricting this parameter 
   to a FQDN, other usages become available such as one not defined at 
   the time of this document's writing or a proprietary naming 
   convention employed within a large internal network. 

      host-response  = "220" SP *TCHAR CRLF / 
                        error-response 

   The HOST command MUST be sent prior to issuing the USER command or 
   logging into the server.  If the specified host is valid, the server 
 
 
Peterson & Papenthien  Expires October 8, 2008                [Page 10] 

Internet-Draft    Streamlined FTP Command Extensions         April 2008 
    

   responds with the usual 220 welcome response, returning the connect 
   message specified for the host. 

5.2. HOST Error Responses 

   If the parameter is invalid, the server MUST use the 504 reply code.  
   If the client session is already logged in (successfully issued USER 
   and PASS commands), the server MUST use the 530 reply code.  If the 
   host_name is unrecognized by the server, the server MUST use the 530 
   reply code. 

   If the server does not accept a host_name parameter, the server MUST 
   continue with login to the default host on the IP address and port. 

5.3. HOST FEAT Response 

   When replying to the FEAT command, a server-FTP process that supports 
   the HOST command SHOULD include a line starting with the word "HOST".  
   If descriptive text is optionally desired, a space MUST immediately 
   follow the "HOST" word.  

      C> FEAT 
      S> 211- <any descriptive text> 
      S>  ... 
      S>  HOST <any descriptive text> 
      S>  ... 
      S> 211 End 

   The ellipses indicate placeholders where other features may be 
   included, and are not required.  The one space indentation of the 
   feature lines is mandatory per [RFC2389]. 

   NOTE: Some servers do not allow the FEAT command to be issued prior 
   to the occurrence of a successful login.  Because the HOST command is 
   required prior to login, a FEAT response code for HOST is optional 
   depending on the server's implementation of FEAT. 

5.4. HOST Examples 

   Assuming host "ftp.domain.com" is defined for the server-FTP process, 
   the client-server exchange would be: 

      C> HOST ftp.domain.com 
      S> 220 Welcome to ftp.domain.com, proceed... 

   When the domain name (host) does not exist, the client-server 
   exchange would be:

6. Retrieve Thumbnail of Remote Image File (THMB) 

   Many user-FTP processes have implemented a view of the remote 
   directory contents that allows for a size-reduced representation of 
   remote files recognized as image types to be displayed.  This size-
   reduced representation of the image is commonly referred to as a 
   thumbnail.  This view of the remote file system usually requires a 
   large amount of resources, in the form of time and bandwidth, in 
   order to be properly represented. 

   The THMB FTP command allows the server-FTP process to locally 
   generate a thumbnail of a requested image type and transfer the 
   resulting image instead of the entire contents of the original image 
   file.  This facilitates a faster and more efficient method of 
   fulfilling a user-FTP process's implementation of a "thumbnail view". 

   Depending on the size of the image file being processed and the CPU 
   resources available to the server-FTP process, this can be a lengthy 
   operation.  Servers that implement this command are encouraged to do 
   so in a way that does not block operations for other client 
   connections. 

6.1. THMB Syntax 

   The THMB FTP command initiates a file transfer of the generated 
   thumbnail image in much the same way that the Retrieve (RETR) FTP 
   command initiates a download of a remote file.  As such, thumbnail 
   transfer occurs over a previously established data connection as 
   indicated in [RFC959].  When the THMB command is received, an initial 
   response is sent over the command connection, the thumbnail is 
   transferred over the data connection, the data connection is closed, 
   and the final response is sent over the command connection. 

   The syntax of the THMB command is: 

      thmb           = "THMB" SP fmt SP 1*DIGIT SP 1*DIGIT SP pathname 
                       CRLF

Internet-Draft    Streamlined FTP Command Extensions         April 2008 
    

   All FTP commands, including THMB, are case insensitive.  However, the 
   "pathname" variable provided with the command may be case sensitive 
   as dictated by the server's operating system. 

   The "fmt" parameter indicates an image format recognized by the 
   server-FTP process that should be used to generate the thumbnail 
   image.  Its value corresponds to the commonly accepted file extension 
   used for the requested image format.  Image formats supported by the 
   server are listed in the THMB FEAT Response [6.3].  The requested 
   thumbnail format does not necessarily conform to the existing format 
   of the image.  For example, a client-FTP process may request a PNG 
   thumbnail of a JPEG image. 

   The two numbers following "fmt" are the requested maximum width and 
   maximum height in pixels, respectively, that the client is willing to 
   accept for the generated thumbnail image.  The server SHOULD preserve 
   the original aspect ratio of the image to avoid distortion while 
   ensuring these maximum values are not exceeded by the generated 
   thumbnail image. 

   The "pathname" specifies a remote file, of a supported image type, 
   that should be sent to the client in thumbnail form according to the 
   other parameters. 

   The syntax of a positive response is: 
    
      Host-response  = "150" SP *TCHAR (1*DIGIT 1*TCHAR) CRLF / 
                        error-response 

   (1*DIGIT) represents the size in octets of the forthcoming file 
   transfer.  The value within the parentheses MAY include descriptive 
   text, for example (123456 Bytes).  By providing this information to 
   the client, the client can determine the required file size and 
   transfer status information. 

   The potential responses to the THMB command that should be expected 
   over the command channel correspond to the list of acceptable 
   responses to the RETR command as defined in [RFC959]. 

   As the THMB command initiates a data transfer over a previously 
   negotiated data connection, the binary image data for the server 
   generated thumbnail image is transferred over this data connection.  
   Because image data is always binary in nature, the server-FTP process 
   will always send this data as if the current data representation type 
   is BINARY, regardless of the setting that was established through the 
   last received TYPE command.  After the THMB command is fully

Internet-Draft    Streamlined FTP Command Extensions         April 2008 
    

   processed, the server-FTP process reverts back to using the 
   previously established data representation type. 

6.2. THMB Error Responses 

   If an error is encountered while attempting to process or generate 
   the thumbnail image, the server MUST use the 550 reply code.  If an 
   error is encountered while allocating resources for temporary storage 
   of the generated thumbnail, the server MUST use the 550 reply code. 

6.3. THMB FEAT Response 

   When replying to the FEAT command, a server-FTP process that supports 
   the THMB command MUST include a line starting with the word "THMB".  
   If descriptive text is optionally desired, a space MUST immediately 
   follow the required "fmt" parameter. 

      C> FEAT 
      S> 211- <any descriptive text> 
      S>  ... 
      S>  THMB <fmt> <any descriptive text> 
      S>  ... 
      S> 211 End 

   The "fmt" variable represents the supported image format(s); multiple 
   format abbreviations can be given separated by the "|" character.  
   Each format abbreviation must be the media subtype name of an 'image' 
   media type that is IANA-registered under the provisions established 
   in [RFC4288] describing a unique file storage format and giving a 
   specific file name extension. Supporting servers must support at 
   least JPEG or PNG formats.  An example THMB response to the FEAT 
   command might be: 

   THMB JPEG|GIF|TIFF|PNG 

   This response identifies JPEG, GIF, TIFF, and PNG formats as image 
   types supported by the server for thumbnail generation. 

   The ellipses indicate placeholders where other features may be 
   included, and are not required.  The one space indentation of the 
   feature lines is mandatory per [RFC2389]. 

6.4. THMB Examples 

   Assuming the existence of image file "widget.png" on the server and 
   that the client has all necessary permissions to access and transfer

   the "widget.png" file, a request for a "widget.png" thumbnail might 
   look like this: 

      C> THMB PNG 80 80 widget.png 
      S> 150 Starting thumbnail transfer (1234 Bytes) for widget.png 
      S> 226 Transfer complete. 

   In between the 150 and 226 server responses, the thumbnail image has 
   been transferred over a negotiated data connection. 

   If the client requests a thumbnail for an unsupported image type, the 
   exchange would be: 

      C> THMB PSP 80 80 widget.psp 
      S> 501 Syntax error in parameters or arguments. 

7. Security Considerations 

   This document does not explicitly address security issues as they 
   pertain to the FTP protocol in general.  The commands introduced in 
   this document do not affect the security of the FTP protocol nor do 
   they address any of the security considerations described in 
   [RFC2577]. 

   Implementation of the RMDA, DSIZ, AVBL, and THMB commands can require 
   significant server resources to process.  This knowledge could be 
   used by attackers in a denial of service attack.  However, this issue 
   has been addressed before with others commands, such as SIZE, and is 
   traditionally mitigated by the server-FTP process's implementation of 
   the command. 

   The FTP server is encouraged to take specific care when implementing 
   the RMDA command to avoid bypassing permissions.  While it may be 
   tempting to take advantage of a method made available by the platform 
   to delete an entire tree of the file system at once, doing so could 
   allow for the possibility of bypassing permissions that apply to 
   specific files.  Consequently, the contents of the path being deleted 
   by RMDA must be individually evaluated. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   None. 

9. Conclusions 

   Inclusion of these commands both for servers and client can 
   significantly reduce bandwidth requirements for many operations as

   well as improving the client-side experience by reducing the amount 
   of time needed to perform these operations via other methods.
