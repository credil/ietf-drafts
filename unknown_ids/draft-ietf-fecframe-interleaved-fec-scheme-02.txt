Abstract

   This document defines a new RTP payload format for the Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) that is generated by the 1-D interleaved parity code
   from a source media encapsulated in RTP.  The 1-D interleaved parity

   code is a systematic code, where a number of repair symbols are
   generated from a set of source symbols and sent in a repair flow
   separate from the source flow that carries the source symbols.  The
   1-D interleaved parity code offers a good protection against bursty
   packet losses at a cost of decent complexity.  The new payload format
   defined in this document is used as a part of the DVB Application-
   layer FEC Specification.

Internet-Draft   RTP Payload Format for Interleaved FEC       March 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document extends the Forward Error Correction (FEC) header
   defined in [RFC2733] and uses this new FEC header for the FEC that is
   generated by the 1-D interleaved parity code from a source media
   encapsulated in RTP [RFC3550].  The resulting new RTP payload format
   is registered by this document.

   The type of the source media protected by the 1-D interleaved parity
   code can be audio, video, text or application.  The FEC data are
   generated according to the media type parameters that are
   communicated through out-of-band means.  The associations/
   relationships between the source and repair flows are also
   communicated through out-of-band means.

   The 1-D interleaved parity FEC uses the exclusive OR (XOR) operation
   to generate the repair symbols.  In a nutshell, the following steps
   take place:

   1.  The sender determines a set of source packets to be protected
       together based on the media type parameters.

   2.  The sender applies the XOR operation on the source symbols to
       generate the required number of repair symbols.

   3.  The sender packetizes the repair symbols and sends the repair
       packet(s) along with the source packets to the receiver(s) (in
       different flows).  The repair packets MAY be sent proactively or
       on-demand.

   Note that the sender MUST transmit the source and repair packets in
   different source and repair flows, respectively to offer backward
   compatibility (See Section 4).  At the receiver side, if all of the
   source packets are successfully received, there is no need for FEC
   recovery and the repair packets are discarded.  However, if there are
   missing source packets, the repair packets can be used to recover the
   missing information.  Block diagrams for the systematic parity FEC
   encoder and decoder are sketched in Figure 1 and Figure 2,
   respectively.

   Suppose that we have a group of D x L source packets that have
   sequence numbers starting from 1 running to D x L. If we apply the
   XOR operation to the group of the source packets whose sequence
   numbers are L apart from each other as sketched in Figure 3, we
   generate L repair packets.  This process is referred to as 1-D
   interleaved FEC protection, and the resulting L repair packets are
   referred to as interleaved (or column) FEC packets.

           Figure 3: Generating interleaved (column) FEC packets

   In Figure 3, S_n and C_m denote the source packet with a sequence
   number n and the interleaved (column) FEC packet with a sequence
   number m, respectively.

1.1.  Use Cases

   We generate one interleaved FEC packet out of D non-consecutive
   source packets.  This repair packet can provide a full recovery of
   the missing information if there is only one packet missing among the
   corresponding source packets.  This implies that 1-D interleaved FEC
   protection performs well under bursty loss conditions provided that L
   is chosen large enough, i.e., L-packet duration SHOULD NOT be shorter
   than the duration of the burst that is intended to be repaired.

   For example, consider the scenario depicted in Figure 4 where the
   sender generates interleaved FEC packets and a bursty loss hits the
   source packets.  Since the number of columns is larger than the
   number of packets lost due to the bursty loss, the repair operation
   succeeds.

                          succeeds error recovery

   The sender may generate interleaved FEC packets to combat with the
   bursty packet losses.  However, two or more random packet losses may
   hit the source and repair packets in the same column.  In that case,
   the repair operation fails.  This is illustrated in Figure 5.  Note
   that it is possible that two or more bursty losses may occur in the
   same source block, in which case interleaved FEC packets may still
   fail to recover the lost data.

1.2.  Overhead Computation

   The overhead is defined as the ratio of the number of bytes belonging
   to the repair packets to the number of bytes belonging to the
   protected source packets.

   Assuming that each repair packet carries an equal number of bytes
   carried by a source packet, we can compute the overhead as follows:

        Overhead = 1/D

   where D is the number of rows in the source block.

1.3.  Relation to Existing Specifications

   This section discusses the relation of the current specification to
   other existing specifications.

1.3.1.  RFC 2733 and RFC 3009

   The current specification extends the FEC header defined in [RFC2733]
   and registers a new RTP payload format.  This new payload format is
   not backward compatible with the payload format that was registered
   by [RFC3009].

1.3.2.  SMPTE 2022-1

   In 2007, the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers
   (SMPTE) - Technology Committee N26 on File Management and Networking
   Technology - decided to revise the Pro-MPEG Code of Practice (CoP) #3
   Release 2 specification, which (was initially produced by the Pro-
   MPEG Forum in 2004) discussed the several aspects of the transmission
   of MPEG-2 transport streams over IP networks.  The new SMPTE
   specification is referred to as [SMPTE2022-1].

   The Pro-MPEG CoP #3 r2 document was originally based on [RFC2733].
   SMPTE revised the document by extending the FEC header (by setting
   the E bit) proposed in [RFC2733].  This extended header offers some
   improvements.

   For example, instead of utilizing the bitmap field used in [RFC2733],
   [SMPTE2022-1] introduces separate fields to convey the number of rows
   (D) and columns (L) of the source block as well as the type of the
   repair packet (i.e., whether the repair packet is an interleaved FEC
   packet computed over a column or a non-interleaved FEC packet
   computed over a row).  These fields plus the base sequence number
   allow the receiver side to establish the associations between the
   source and repair packets.  Note that although the bitmap field is

Internet-Draft   RTP Payload Format for Interleaved FEC       March 2009


   not utilized, the FEC header of [SMPTE2022-1] inherently carries over
   the bitmap field from [RFC2733].

   On the other hand, some parts of [SMPTE2022-1] are not in compliant
   with RTP [RFC3550].  For example, [SMPTE2022-1] sets the SSRC field
   to zero and does not use the timestamp field in the RTP headers of
   the repair packets (Receivers ignore the timestamps of the repair
   packets).  Furthermore, [SMPTE2022-1] also sets the CC field in the
   RTP header to zero and does not allow any Contributing Source (CSRC)
   entry in the RTP header.

   The current document adopts the extended FEC header of [SMPTE2022-1]
   and registers a new RTP payload format.  At the same time, this
   document fixes the parts of [SMPTE2022-1] that are not in compliant
   with RTP [RFC3550].

1.3.3.  ETSI TS 102 034

   In 2007, the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) consortium published a
   technical specification [ETSI-TS-102-034] through European
   Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).  This specification
   covers several areas related to the transmission of MPEG-2 transport
   stream-based services over IP networks.

   The Annex E of [ETSI-TS-102-034] defines an optional protocol for
   Application-layer FEC (AL-FEC) protection of streaming media for
   DVB-IP services carried over RTP [RFC3550] transport.  AL-FEC
   protocol uses two layers for protection:  a base layer that is
   produced by a packet-based interleaved parity code, and an
   enhancement layer that is produced by a Raptor code.  While the use
   of the enhancement layer is optional, the use of the base layer is
   mandatory wherever AL-FEC is used.  The DVB AL-FEC protocol is also
   described in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-dvb-al-fec].

   The interleaved parity code that is used in the base layer is a
   subset of [SMPTE2022-1].  In particular, AL-FEC base layer uses only
   the 1-D interleaved FEC protection from [SMPTE2022-1].  The new RTP
   payload format that is defined and registered in this document (with
   some exceptions listed in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-dvb-al-fec]) is used as
   the AL-FEC base layer.

4.1.  Source Packets

   The source packets MUST contain the information that identifies the
   source block and the position within the source block occupied by the
   packet.  Since the source packets that are carried within an RTP
   stream already contain unique sequence numbers in their RTP headers
   [RFC3550], we can identify the source packets in a straightforward
   manner and there is no need to append additional field(s).  The
   primary advantage of not modifying the source packets in any way is
   that it provides backward compatibility for the receivers that do not
   support FEC at all.  In multicast scenarios, this backward
   compatibility becomes quite useful as it allows the non-FEC-capable
   and FEC-capable receivers to receive and interpret the same source
   packets sent in the same multicast session.

4.2.  Repair Packets

   The repair packets MUST contain information that identifies the
   source block they pertain to and the relationship between the
   contained repair symbols and the original source block.  For this
   purpose, we use the RTP header of the repair packets as well as
   another header within the RTP payload, which we refer to as the FEC
   header, as shown in Figure 6.

                    Figure 6: Format of repair packets

   The RTP header is formatted according to [RFC3550] with some further
   clarifications listed below:

   o  Version:  The version field is set to 2.

   o  Padding (P) Bit:  This bit is obtained by applying protection to
      the corresponding P bits from the RTP headers of the source
      packets protected by this repair packet.  However, padding octets
      are never present in a repair packet, independent of the value of
      the P bit.

Internet-Draft   RTP Payload Format for Interleaved FEC       March 2009


   o  Extension (X) Bit:  This bit is obtained by applying protection to
      the corresponding X bits from the RTP headers of the source
      packets protected by this repair packet.  However, an RTP header
      extension is never present in a repair packet, independent of the
      value of the X bit.

   o  CSRC Count (CC):  This field is obtained by applying protection to
      the corresponding CC values from the RTP headers of the source
      packets protected by this repair packet.  However, a CSRC list is
      never present in a repair packet, independent of the value of the
      CC field.

   o  Marker (M) Bit:  This bit is obtained by applying protection to
      the corresponding M bits from the RTP headers of the source
      packets protected by this repair packet.

   o  Payload Type:  The (dynamic) payload type for the repair packets
      is determined through out-of-band means.  Note that this document
      registers a new payload format for the repair packets (Refer to
      Section 5 for details).  According to [RFC3550], an RTP receiver
      that cannot recognize a payload type must discard it.  This
      provides backward compatibility.  The FEC mechanisms can then be
      used in a multicast group with mixed FEC-capable and non-FEC-
      capable receivers.  If a non-FEC-capable receiver receives a
      repair packet, it will not recognize the payload type, and hence,
      discards the repair packet.

   o  Sequence Number (SN):  The sequence number has the standard
      definition.  It MUST be one higher than the sequence number in the
      previously transmitted repair packet.  The initial value of the
      sequence number SHOULD be random (unpredictable) [RFC3550].

   o  Timestamp (TS):  The timestamp SHALL be set to a time
      corresponding to the repair packet's transmission time.  Note that
      the timestamp value has no use in the actual FEC protection
      process and is usually useful for jitter calculations.

   o  Synchronization Source (SSRC):  The SSRC value SHALL be randomly
      assigned as suggested by [RFC3550].  This allows the sender to
      multiplex the source and repair flows on the same port, or
      multiplex multiple repair flows on a single port.  The repair
      flows SHOULD use the RTCP CNAME field to associate themselves with
      the source flow.

      In some networks, the RTP Source, which produces the source
      packets and the FEC Source, which generates the repair packets
      from the source packets may not be the same host.  In such
      scenarios, using the same CNAME for the source and repair flows



Begen                   Expires September 8, 2009              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft   RTP Payload Format for Interleaved FEC       March 2009


      means that the RTP Source and the FEC Source MUST share the same
      CNAME (for this specific source-repair flow association).  A
      common CNAME may be produced based on an algorithm that is known
      both to the RTP and FEC Source.  This usage is compliant with
      [RFC3550].

      Note that due to the randomness of the SSRC assignments, there is
      a possibility of SSRC collision.  In such cases, the collisions
      MUST be resolved as described in [RFC3550].

   Note that the P bit, X bit, CC field and M bit of the source packets
   are protected by the corresponding bits/fields in the RTP header of
   the repair packet.  On the other hand, the payload of a repair packet
   protects the concatenation of (if present) the CSRC list, RTP
   extension, payload and padding of the source RTP packets associated
   with this repair packet.

   The FEC header is 16 octets.  The format of the FEC header is shown
   in Figure 7.

                    Figure 7: Format of the FEC header

   The FEC header consists of the following fields:

   o  The SN base low field is used to indicate the lowest sequence
      number, taking wrap around into account, of those source packets
      protected by this repair packet.

   o  The Length recovery field is used to determine the length of any
      recovered packets.

   o  The E bit is the extension flag introduced in [RFC2733] and used
      to extend the [RFC2733] FEC header.

   o  The PT recovery field is used to determine the payload type of the
      recovered packets.

   o  The Mask field is not used.

   o  The TS recovery field is used to determine the timestamp of the
      recovered packets.

   o  The N bit is the extension flag that is reserved for future uses.

   o  The D bit is not used.

   o  The Type field indicates the type of the error-correcting code
      used.  This document defines only one error-correcting code.

   o  The Index field is not used.

   o  The Offset and NA fields are used to indicate the number of
      columns (L) and rows (D) of the source block, respectively.

   o  The SN base ext field is not used.

   The details on setting the fields in the FEC header are provided in
   Section 6.2.

   It should be noted that a mask-based approach (similar to the one
   specified in [RFC2733]) may not be very efficient to indicate which
   source packets in the current source block are associated with a
   given repair packet.  In particular, for the applications that would
   like to use large source block sizes, the size of the mask that is
   required to describe the source-repair packet associations may be
   prohibitively large.  Instead, a systematic approach is inherently
   more efficient.


5.  Payload Format Parameters

   This section provides the media subtype registration for the 1-D
   interleaved parity FEC.  The parameters that are required to
   configure the FEC encoding and decoding operations are also defined
   in this section.

5.1.  Media Type Registration

   This registration is done using the template defined in [RFC4288] and
   following the guidance provided in [RFC3555].

   Subtype name:  1d-interleaved-parityfec

   Required parameters:

   o  rate:  The RTP timestamp (clock) rate.  The rate SHALL be larger
      than 1000 Hz to provide sufficient resolution to RTCP operations.
      However, it is RECOMMENDED to select the rate that matches the
      rate of the protected source RTP stream.

   o  L:  Number of columns of the source block.  L is a positive
      integer that is less than or equal to 255.

   o  D:  Number of rows of the source block.  D is a positive integer
      that is less than or equal to 255.

   o  repair-window:  The time that spans the source packets and the
      corresponding repair packets.  An FEC encoder processes a block of
      source packets and generates a number of repair packets, which are
      then transmitted within a certain duration.  At the receiver, the
      FEC decoder tries to decode all the packets received within the
      repair window to recover the missing packets.  Assuming that there
      is no issue of delay variation, the FEC decoder SHOULD NOT wait
      longer than the repair window since additional waiting would not
      help the recovery process.  The size of the repair window is
      specified in microseconds.

   Optional parameters:  None.

   Encoding considerations:  This media type is framed (See Section 4.8
   in the template document [RFC4288]) and contains binary data.

   Security considerations:  See Section 9 of this document.

   Interoperability considerations:  None.

5.2.  Mapping to SDP Parameters

   Applications that are using RTP transport commonly use Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] to describe their RTP sessions.
   The information that is used to specify the media types in an RTP
   session has specific mappings to the fields in an SDP description.
   In this section, we provide these mappings for the media subtype
   registered by this document ("1d-interleaved-parityfec").  Note that

Internet-Draft   RTP Payload Format for Interleaved FEC       March 2009


   if an application does not use SDP to describe the RTP sessions, an
   appropriate mapping must be defined and used to specify the media
   types and their parameters for the control/description protocol
   employed by the application.

   The mapping of the media type specification for "1d-interleaved-
   parityfec" and its parameters in SDP is as follows:

   o  The media type (e.g., "application") goes into the "m=" line as
      the media name.

   o  The media subtype ("1d-interleaved-parityfec") goes into the
      "a=rtpmap" line as the encoding name.  The RTP clock rate
      parameter ("rate") also goes into the "a=rtpmap" line as the clock
      rate.

   o  The remaining required payload-format-specific parameters go into
      the "a=fmtp" line by copying them directly from the media type
      string as a semicolon-separated list of parameter=value pairs.

   SDP examples are provided in Section 7.

5.2.1.  Offer-Answer Model Considerations

   When offering 1-D interleaved parity FEC over RTP using SDP in an
   Offer/Answer model [RFC3264], the following considerations apply:

   o  Each combination of the L and D parameters produces a different
      FEC data and is not compatible with any other combination.  A
      sender application may desire to offer multiple offers with
      different sets of L and D values as long as the parameter values
      are valid.  The receiver SHOULD normally choose the offer that has
      a sufficient amount of interleaving.  If multiple such offers
      exist, the receiver may choose the offer that has the lowest
      overhead or the one that requires the smallest amount of
      buffering.  The selection depends on the application requirements.

   o  The value for the repair-window parameter depends on the L and D
      values and cannot be chosen arbitrarily.  More specifically, L and
      D values determine the lower limit for the repair-window size.
      The upper limit of the repair-window size does not depend on the L
      and D values.

   o  Although combinations with the same L and D values but with
      different repair-window sizes produce the same FEC data, such
      combinations are still considered different offers.  The size of
      the repair-window is related to how fast the sender will send the
      repair packets.  This directly impacts the buffering requirement

      on the receiver side and the receiver must consider this when
      choosing an offer.

   o  There are no optional format parameters defined for this payload.
      Any unknown option in the offer MUST be ignored and deleted from
      the answer.

5.2.2.  Declarative Considerations

   In declarative usage, like SDP in the Real-time Streaming Protocol
   (RTSP) [RFC2326] or the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
   [RFC2974], the following considerations apply:

   o  The payload format configuration parameters are all declarative
      and a participant MUST use the configuration that is provided for
      the session.

   o  More than one configuration may be provided (if desired) by
      declaring multiple RTP payload types.  In that case, the receivers
      should choose the repair flow that is best for them.


6.  Protection and Recovery Procedures

   This section provides a complete specification of the 1-D interleaved
   parity code.

6.1.  Overview

   The following sections specify the steps involved in generating the
   repair packets and reconstructing the missing source packets from the
   repair packets.

6.2.  Repair Packet Construction

   The RTP header of a repair packet is formed based on the guidelines
   given in Section 4.2.

   The FEC header includes 16 octets.  It is constructed by applying the
   XOR operation on the bit strings that are generated from the
   individual source packets protected by this particular repair packet.
   The set of the source packets that are associated with a given repair
   packet can be computed by the formula given in Section 6.3.1.

   The bit string is formed for each source packet by concatenating the
   following fields together in the order specified:

   o  Padding bit (1 bit) (This is the most significant bit of the bit
      string)

   o  Extension bit (1 bit)

   o  CC field (4 bits)

   o  Marker bit (1 bit)

   o  PT field (7 bits)

   o  Timestamp (32 bits)

   o  Unsigned network-ordered 16-bit representation of the source
      packet length in bytes minus 12 (for the fixed RTP header), i.e.,
      the sum of the lengths of all the following if present:  the CSRC
      list, header extension, RTP payload and RTP padding (16 bits)

   o  If CC is nonzero, the CSRC list (variable length)

   o  If X is 1, the header extension (variable length)

   o  Payload (variable length)

   o  Padding, if present (variable length)

   Note that if the payload lengths of the source packets are not equal,
   each shorter packet MUST be padded to the length of the longest
   packet by adding octet 0's at the end.  Due to this possible padding
   and mandatory FEC header, a repair packet usually has a larger size
   than the source packets it protects.  This may cause problems if the
   resulting repair packet size exceeds the Maximum Transmission Unit
   (MTU) size of the path over which the repair flow is sent.

   By applying the parity operation on the bit strings produced from the
   source packets, we generate the FEC bit string.  Some parts of the
   RTP header and the FEC header of the repair packet are generated from
   the FEC bit string as follows:

   o  The first (most significant) bit in the FEC bit string is written
      into the Padding bit in the RTP header of the repair packet.

   o  The next bit in the FEC bit string is written into the Extension
      bit in the RTP header of the repair packet.

   o  The next 4 bits of the FEC bit string are written into the CC
      field in the RTP header of the repair packet.

Internet-Draft   RTP Payload Format for Interleaved FEC       March 2009


   o  The next bit of the FEC bit string is written into the Marker bit
      in the RTP header of the repair packet.

   o  The next 7 bits of the FEC bit string are written into the PT
      recovery field in the FEC header.

   o  The next 32 bits of the FEC bit string are written into the TS
      recovery field in the FEC header.

   o  The next 16 bits are written into the Length recovery field in the
      FEC header.  This allows the FEC procedure to be applied even when
      the lengths of the protected source packets are not identical.

   o  The remaining bits are set to be the payload of the repair packet.

   The remaining parts of the FEC header are set as follows:

   o  The SN base low field MUST be set to the lowest sequence number,
      taking wrap around into account, of those source packets protected
      by this repair packet.

   o  The E bit MUST be set to 1 to extend the [RFC2733] FEC header.

   o  The Mask field SHALL be set to 0 and ignored by the receiver.

   o  The N bit SHALL be set to 0 and ignored by the receiver.

   o  The D bit SHALL be set to 0 and ignored by the receiver.

   o  The Type field MUST be set to 0.

   o  The Index field SHALL be set to 0 and ignored by the receiver.

   o  The Offset field MUST be set to the number of columns of the
      source block (L).

   o  The NA field MUST be set to the number of rows of the source block
      (D).

   o  The SN base ext field SHALL be set to 0 and ignored by the
      receiver.

6.3.  Source Packet Reconstruction

   This section describes the recovery procedures that are required to
   reconstruct the missing packets.  The recovery process has two steps.
   In the first step, the FEC decoder determines which source and repair
   packets should be used in order to recover a missing packet.  In the



Begen                   Expires September 8, 2009              [Page 23]

Internet-Draft   RTP Payload Format for Interleaved FEC       March 2009


   second step, the decoder recovers the missing packet, which consists
   of an RTP header and RTP payload.

   In the following, we describe the RECOMMENDED algorithms for the
   first and second steps.  Based on the implementation, different
   algorithms MAY be adopted.  However, the end result MUST be identical
   to the one produced by the algorithms described below.

6.3.1.  Associating the Source and Repair Packets

   The first step is to associate the source and repair packets.  The SN
   base low field in the FEC header shows the lowest sequence number of
   the source packets that form the particular column.  In addition, the
   information of how many source packets are available in each column
   and row is available from the media type parameters specified in the
   SDP description.  This set of information uniquely identifies all of
   the source packets associated with a given repair packet.

   Mathematically, for any received repair packet, p*, we can determine
   the sequence numbers of the source packets that are protected by this
   repair packet as follows:

                               p*_snb + i * L

   where p*_snb denotes the value in the SN base low field of p*'s FEC
   header, L is the number of columns of the source block and

                                 0 <= i < D

   where D is the number of rows of the source block.

   We denote the set of the source packets associated with repair packet
   p* by set T(p*).  Note that in a source block whose size is L columns
   by D rows, set T includes D source packets.  Recall that 1-D
   interleaved FEC protection can fully recover the missing information
   if there is only one source packet is missing in set T. If the repair
   packet that protects the source packets in set T is missing, or the
   repair packet is available but two or more source packets are
   missing, then missing source packets in set T cannot be recovered by
   1-D interleaved FEC protection.

6.3.2.  Recovering the RTP Header and Payload

   For a given set T, the procedure for the recovery of the RTP header
   of the missing packet, whose sequence number is denoted by SEQNUM, is
   as follows:





Begen                   Expires September 8, 2009              [Page 24]

Internet-Draft   RTP Payload Format for Interleaved FEC       March 2009


   1.   For each of the source packets that are successfully received in
        set T, compute the bit string as described in Section 6.2.

   2.   For the repair packet associated with set T, compute the bit
        string in the same fashion except use the PT recovery field
        instead of the PT field and TS recovery field instead of the
        Timestamp field, and set the CSRC list, header extension and
        padding to null regardless of the values of the CC field, X bit
        and P bit.

   3.   If any of the bit strings generated from the source packets are
        shorter than the bit string generated from the repair packet,
        pad them to be the same length as the bit string generated from
        the repair packet.  For padding, the padding of octet 0 MUST be
        added at the end of the bit string.

   4.   Calculate the recovered bit string as the XOR of the bit strings
        generated from all source packets in set T and the FEC bit
        string generated from the repair packet associated with set T.

   5.   Create a new packet with the standard 12-byte RTP header and no
        payload.

   6.   Set the version of the new packet to 2.

   7.   Set the Padding bit in the new packet to the first bit in the
        recovered bit string.

   8.   Set the Extension bit in the new packet to the next bit in the
        recovered bit string.

   9.   Set the CC field to the next 4 bits in the recovered bit string.

   10.  Set the Marker bit in the new packet to the next bit in the
        recovered bit string.

   11.  Set the Payload type in the new packet to the next 7 bits in the
        recovered bit string.

   12.  Set the SN field in the new packet to SEQNUM.

   13.  Set the TS field in the new packet to the next 32 bits in the
        recovered bit string.

   14.  Take the next 16 bits of the recovered bit string and set Y to
        whatever unsigned integer this represents (assuming network-
        order).  Take Y bytes from the recovered bit string and append
        them to the new packet.  Y represents the length of the new

        packet in bytes minus 12 (for the fixed RTP header), i.e., the
        sum of the lengths of all the following if present:  the CSRC
        list, header extension, RTP payload and RTP padding.

   15.  Set the SSRC of the new packet to the SSRC of the source RTP
        stream.

   This procedure completely recovers both the header and payload of an
   RTP packet.


7.  Session Description Protocol (SDP) Signaling

   This section provides an SDP [RFC4566] example.  The following
   example uses the FEC grouping semantics [RFC4756].

   In this example, we have one source video stream (mid:S1) and one FEC
   repair stream (mid:R1).  We form one FEC group with the "a=group:FEC
   S1 R1" line.  The source and repair streams are sent to the same port
   on different multicast groups.  The repair window is set to 200 ms.

        a=fmtp:110 L:5; D:10; repair-window: 200000
        a=mid:R1


8.  Congestion Control Considerations

   FEC is an effective approach to provide applications resiliency
   against packet losses.  However, in networks where the congestion is
   a major contributor to the packet loss, the potential impacts of
   using FEC SHOULD be considered carefully before injecting the repair
   flows into the network.  In particular, in bandwidth-limited
   networks, FEC repair flows may consume most or all of the available
   bandwidth and may consequently congest the network.  In such cases,
   the applications MUST NOT arbitrarily increase the amount of FEC
   protection since doing so may lead to a congestion collapse.  If



Begen                   Expires September 8, 2009              [Page 26]

Internet-Draft   RTP Payload Format for Interleaved FEC       March 2009


   desired, stronger FEC protection MAY be applied only after the source
   rate has been reduced.

   In a network-friendly implementation, an application SHOULD NOT send/
   receive FEC repair flows if it knows that sending/receiving those FEC
   repair flows would not help at all in recovering the missing packets.
   Such a practice helps reduce the amount of wasted bandwidth.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the amount of FEC protection is adjusted dynamically
   based on the packet loss rate observed by the applications.

   In multicast scenarios, it may be difficult to optimize the FEC
   protection per receiver.  If there is a large variation among the
   levels of FEC protection needed by different receivers, it is
   RECOMMENDED that the sender offers multiple repair flows with
   different levels of FEC protection and the receivers join the
   corresponding multicast sessions to receive the repair flow(s) that
   is best for them.


9.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550] and in any applicable RTP profile.  The main
   security considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload
   format defined within this memo are confidentiality, integrity and
   source authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encrypting the
   RTP payload.  Integrity of the RTP packets is achieved through a
   suitable cryptographic integrity protection mechanism.  Such a
   cryptographic system may also allow the authentication of the source
   of the payload.  A suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload
   format should provide confidentiality, integrity protection, and at
   least source authentication capable of determining if an RTP packet
   is from a member of the RTP session.

   Note that the appropriate mechanism to provide security to RTP and
   payloads following this memo may vary.  It is dependent on the
   application, transport and signaling protocol employed.  Therefore, a
   single mechanism is not sufficient, although if suitable, using the
   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] is recommended.
   Other mechanisms that may be used are IPsec [RFC4301] and Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (RTP over TCP); other alternatives may
   exist.
