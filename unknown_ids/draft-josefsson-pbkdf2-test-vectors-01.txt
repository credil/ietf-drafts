Internet-Draft       Test vectors for PKCS #5 PBKDF2         August 2010


1.  Introduction

   The PKCS #5 [RFC2898] Password Based Key Derivation Function 2
   (PBKDF2) is used by several protocols to derive encryption keys from
   a password.

   Test vectors for the algorithm were not included in the original
   specification, but are often useful for implementers.


2.  PBKDF2 test vectors for HMAC-SHA1

   The SCRAM [I-D.ietf-sasl-scram] protocol uses PBKDF2 with HMAC
   [RFC2104] and SHA-1 [FIPS.180-1.1995].

     Input:
       P = "password" (8 octets)
       S = "salt" (4 octets)
       c = 1
       dkLen = 20

     Output:
       DK = 0c 60 c8 0f 96 1f 0e 71 f3 a9 b5 24 af 60 12 06 2f e0 37 a6


     Input:
       P = "password" (8 octets)
       S = "salt" (4 octets)
       c = 2
       dkLen = 20

     Output:
       DK = ea 6c 01 4d c7 2d 6f 8c cd 1e d9 2a ce 1d 41 f0 d8 de 89 57


     Input:
       P = "password" (8 octets)
       S = "salt" (4 octets)
       c = 4096
       dkLen = 20

     Output:
       DK = 4b 00 79 01 b7 65 48 9a be ad 49 d9 26 f7 21 d0 65 a4 29 c1

3.  Acknowledgements

   Barry Brachman and Love Hoernquist Aestrand confirmed the test
   vectors and pointed out a mistake in the salt octet length count.
