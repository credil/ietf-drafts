    <abstract>
      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In
      particular, it defines managed objects that provide information 
      on the status of batteries in managed devices.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Today more and more managed devices contain batteries that supply them
      with power when disconnected from electrical power distribution grids. 
      Common examples are nomadic and mobile devices, such as notebook 
      computers, netbooks, and smart phones.  The status of batteries in such
      a device, particularly the charging status is typically controlled by 
      automatic functions that act locally on the device and manually by users 
      of the device.</t>

      <t>In addition to this, there is a need to monitor battery status of 
      these devices by network management systems. This document defines a 
      portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) that meets the 
      requirements for monitoring the status of batteries described in 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-eman-requirements"></xref>.
      Managed objects defined in <xref target="definitions"/> serve for 
      monitoring </t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
        <t>the current charge of a battery,</t>
        <t>the age of a battery (charging cycles),</t>
        <t>the state of a battery (e.g. being re-charged),</t>
        <t>last usage of a battery,</t>              
        <t>maximum energy provided by a battery (remaining and total capacity).</t>
      </list></t>
      
      <t>In addition, means are provided for battery-powered devices
      to send notifications when the current battery charge has dropped below a 
      certain threshold in order to inform the management system of needed
      replacement. The same applies to the age of a battery.</t>
      
      <t>There is already instrumentation for monitoring battery
      status on many battery-driven devices, because this is already needed 
      for local control of the battery by the device. This reduces the effort
      for implementing the managed objects defined in this document. For many
      devices only additional software will be needed an no additional hardware
      instrumentation for battery monitoring.</t>

      <t>A traditional type of managed device containing batteries is 
      an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system; these supply other devices 
      with electrical energy when the main power supply fails. There is already
      a MIB module for managing UPS systems defined in 
      <xref target="RFC1628">RFC 1628</xref>. This module includes managed
      objects for monitoring the batteries contained in an UPS system. However,
      the information provided by these objects is limited and tailored the 
      particular needs of UPS systems.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">
      RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

    <section title="The Internet-Standard Management Framework">
      <t>For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
      Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
      <xref target="RFC3410">RFC 3410</xref>.</t>

      <t>Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
      the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
      accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects
      in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of
      Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies MIB modules that is
      compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, <xref
      target="RFC2578">RFC 2578</xref>, STD 58, <xref target="RFC2579"> RFC
      2579</xref> and STD 58,<xref target="RFC2580">RFC 2580</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Structure of the Battery MIB module">
      <t>The Battery MIB module defined in this document defines objects for
      reporting information about batteries. All managed objects providing
      information of the status of a battery are contained in a single table
      called batteryTable. The batteryTable contains one conceptual row 
      per battery.</t>

      <t>If there is an implementation of the <xref target="RFC4133">Entity MIB 
      module</xref> that identifies batteries by individual values for
      managed object entPhysicalIndex, then it is RECOMMENDED that these values
      are used as index values for the batteryTable.</t>

      <t>The kind of entity in the entPhysicalTable of the Entity MIB 
      module is indicated by the value of enumeration object entPhysicalClass. 
      Since there is no value called 'battery' defined for this object, it is 
      RECOMMENDED that for batteries the value of this object is chosen to be 
      powerSupply(6).</t>

      <t>The batteryTable contains three groups of objects. The first group
      (OIDs ending with 2-6) provides information on static properties of the 
      battery. The second group of objects (OIDs ending with 7-14) provides
      information on the current battery state, if it is charging or 
      discharging, how much it is charged, its remaining capacity, the number 
      of experienced charging cycles, etc.</t>

      <t>The third group of objects in this table (OIDs ending with 15-18) 
      indicates thresholds which can be used to raise an alarm if a property 
      of the battery exceeds one of them. Raising an alarm may include sending 
      a notification.</t>
      
      <t>The Battery MIB defines two notifications, one indicating a low battery
      charging state and one indicating an aged battery that may need to be
      replaced.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
      a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. So, if this MIB
      module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder
      can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct
      SNMP SET operations.</t>

      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
      MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
      even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
      encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
      via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>This list is still to be done.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
      if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
      and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
      module.</t>

      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
      provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including
      full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication
      and privacy).</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
      RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
      cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to
      ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
      module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
      those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
      SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The MIB modules in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[

        batteryMIB        { mib-2 xxx }
      ]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>Other than that this document does not impose any IANA
      considerations.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Open Issues">
      <section title="Battery temperature">
        <t>Is there a need to report the temperature of the battery? 
        The UPS MIB does so with object upsBatteryTemperature.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Scale of the charge percentage">
        <t>Should object batteryCurrentChargePercentage report the 
        percentage of the current charge with respect to the nominal 
        battery capacity or with respect to the remaining capacity?</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Define Charging Cycle">
        <t>The draft is not clear about what a charging cycle is. 
        Is there any commonly accpted definition of it?</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Define Battery States 'full' and 'emplty'">
        <t>Is a battery 'full' if it is charged 99%? When is it empty?
        Is it full if it has reached remaining capacity 
        or only if it has achieved nominal capacity?</t>
