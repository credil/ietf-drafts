Abstract

   Mobility of an IP-based node affects routing paths, and as a result,
   can have a significant effect on the protocol operation and state
   management.  This draft discusses the effects mobility can cause to
   the NSIS protocol suite, and how the protocols operate in different
   scenarios, with mobility management protocols.

1.  Introduction

   Mobility of IP-based nodes incurs route changes, usually at the edge
   of the network.  Route changes may also be caused by reasons other
   than mobility, such as routing protocol adaptation in response to
   varying network conditions (load sharing, load balancing, etc), or
   host multi-homing.  Macro mobility also involves the change of the
   mobile node's IP addresses.  Since IP addresses are usually part of
   flow identifiers, the change of IP addresses implies the change of
   flow identifiers.  Local mobility usually does not cause the change
   of the global IP addresses, but affects the routing paths within the
   local access network

   The NSIS protocol suit consists of two layers: NSIS Transport Layer
   Protocol (NTLP) and the NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP).  The
   General Internet Signaling Transport [1] is the NTLP protocol.  GIST
   is a signaling application independent protocol and transports
   service- related information between neighboring GIST nodes.  Each
   specific service has its own NSLP protocol; currently there two
   standardized NSLP protocols, the QoS NSLP [2], and the NAT/Firewall
   NSLP [3]

   The goals of this draft are to present the effects of mobility on the
   NTLP/NSLPs and to provide guides on how such NSIS protocols works in
   basic mobility scenarios, including support for Mobile IPv4 and
   Mobile IPv6 scenarios.  This draft also briefly introduces
   interworking with more complex mobility-related scenarios and their
   issues as further study.

2.  Requirements Notation and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [4].

   The terminology in this draft is based on [1] and [9].  In addition,
   the following terms are used.  Note that in this draft, a generic
   route change caused by regular IP routing is referred to as a 'route
   change', and especially, the route change caused by mobility is
   referred to as 'mobility' like [9].

   (1) Downstream

   The direction from a data sender towards the data receiver.

   (2) Upstream

   The direction from a data receiver towards the data sender.

   (3) Crossover Node (CRN)

   A Crossover Node is a node that for a given function is a merging
   point of two or more paths along which states are installed.

   In the mobility scenarios, there are two different types of merging
   points in the network according to the direction of signaling flows
   followed by data flows as shown in Figure 2 of Section 4.2, where we
   assume that the MN is the data sender.

      Upstream CRN (UCRN): the node closest to the data sender from
      which the state information in the direction from data receiver to
      data sender begins to diverge after a handover.

      Downstream CRN (DCRN): the node closest to the data sender from
      which the state information in the direction from the data sender
      to the data receiver begins to converge after a handover.

   In general, the DCRN and the UCRN may be different due to the
   asymmetric characteristics of routing although the data receiver is
   the same.

   (4) State Update

   State Update is the procedure for the re-establishment of NSIS state
   on the new path, the teardown of NSIS state on the old path, and the
   update of NSIS state on the common path due to the mobility.  The
   State Update procedure is used to address mobility for the affected

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility          February 2008


   flows.

      Upstream State Update: State Update for the upstream signaling
      flow which is initiated by an upstream signaling initiator.  If
      the MN is a data sender, the State Update is initiated by an NI on
      the common path (e.g., a CN, an HA, or an MAP).

      Downstream State Update: State Update for the downstream signaling
      flow which is triggered by a downstream signaling initiator.  If
      the MN is a data sender, the State Update is triggered by an NI on
      the new path (e.g., an MN, a mobility agent, or an AR).

   If a route change happens without any change of the flow identifier,
   State update on the common path is not required because the flow
   identifiers do not change.  Especially, in mobility scenarios, if the
   NSIS signaling interacts with local mobility management (LMM)
   protocols (e.g., HMIPv6), the State Update can be localized within
   the access network.  In this case, setup delay of NSIS signaling can
   be minimized.

3.  Problem Statement

   IP mobility in its simplest form only includes route changes.  This
   section identifies problems caused by mobility and multihoming, which
   affect the operations of NSIS protocol suit.  We also show how the
   NSIS protocols cope with the problems identified as below.

   1.  Change of route and possibly change of the MN IP address

   Topology changes or network reconfiguration might lead to path
   changes for data packets sent to or from the MN and can cause an IP
   address change of the MN.  When an IP address changes by mobility,
   firewall rules, NAT, bindings and QoS reservations become invalid
   because the established flow identifier refers to a non-existent
   flow.  The impact of an out-dated flow identifier is most servers in
   the NAT/FW case since the traffic will be blocked, or traffic will be
   forwarded to the wrong IP address.  In the QoS NSLP case, the impact
   is limited to that the flow experiences best-effort treatment for a
   limited period of time (until the flow identifier is updated again).

   NSIS solution: The NSIS suite decouples state and flow
   identification.  A state is stored and referred to by the Session ID
   (SID).  Flows associated with a given NSLP state are defined by the
   Message Routing Information (MRI).  GIST notifies when a routing path
   associated with a SID changes, and provides a notification to the
   NSLP.  It is then up to the NSLP to update the state information in
   the network.  Thus, the effect is an update to the states, not a full
   new request.  This decoupling effectively solves also a typical
   problem with certain signaling protocols, where protocol state is
   identified with flow endpoints, and when a flow endpoint changes, the
   whole session state becomes invalid.

   2.  Double state problem

   Since the state on the old path still remains as it is after re-
   establishing the state along the new path due to mobility (or route
   changes), the double reservation problem occurs.  Although the state
   on the old path will be deleted automatically based on the soft state
   timeout, the refresh timer value may be quite long (e.g., 30s as a
   default value in RSVP).  With the QoS NSLP, this problem might result
   in the waste of resources and lead to failure of other reservations
   (due to lack of resources).  With the NAT/FW NSLP, it is still
   possible to re-use this installed state although a mobile node roams
   to a new location; this means that another host can send data through
   a firewall without any prior NSIS NAT/FW signaling because of the
   previous state which is not yet expired.

   NSIS solution: Removing old state in the network is a functionality



Sanda (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 25, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility          February 2008


   of each NSLP independently.  The QoS NSLP solves this through the use
   of the Reservation Sequence Number (RSN).  The RSN makes it possible
   to identify new updated information related to a resource
   reservation.  A QNE that is CRN for a given reservation is able to
   tear down an old reservation, and install a new reservation on the
   new path.  More details can be found in the QoS NSLP specification.
   [WHAT DOES THE NAT/FW DO?]

   3.  End-to-end signaling and frequency of route changes

   The change of route and IP addresses in mobile environments is
   typically much faster and more frequent than traditional route
   changes caused by node or link failure.  This results in a need to
   update NSLP states at a fast pace.  A ping-pong type of handover
   scenario may happen.  Also, the flow identifier (MRI) may change.

   NSIS solution: If the MRI does not change due to handovers, the NSIS
   protocols are able to localize the update to only the new path.  One
   of the NSIS nodes on the path is a merging point of the old and new
   routing paths, and is able to confine the signaling to only the
   affect path.  Thus, no end-to-end signaling is needed.  If the MRI
   changes, end-to-end signaling will happen since all the nodes on the
   path must be provided with an updated flow identification (MRI); the
   SID does not change.  The ping-pong type of movement is a problem
   caused by the mobility management.  Thus, fixing this is out of scope
   of the NSIS protocols.

   4.  Upstream State Update vs. Downstream State Update

   Since the upstream and downstream paths are likely not to be exactly
   the same, the upstream and downstream CRNs may not coincide, either.
   Therefore, the State Update needs to be handled independently for the
   upstream and the downstream, including the discovery of upstream and
   downstream CRNs.

   5.  Identification of the crossover node

   When a handover at the edge of a network has happened, in the typical
   case, only some parts of the end-to-end path used by the data packets
   changes.  In this situation, the CRN plays a central role in managing
   the establishment of the new signaling application state, and
   removing any useless state.

   NSIS solution: GIST provides NSLPs with an identifier of the next
   signaling peer, the SII Handle.  When this handle changes, the NSLP
   knows a routing change has happened.  Yet, the NSLP can also figure
   out if it is also the crossover node for the session.  More details
   can be found in the NSLP specifications.

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility          February 2008


   6.  Authorization Issues

   The procedure of State Update may be initiated by the MN, the CN, or
   even nodes within the network (e.g., crossover node, MAP in HMIP).
   This State Update on behalf of the MN raises authorization issues
   about the entity that is allowed to make these state modifications.

   NSIS solution: Since NSIS operates on a hop-by-hop basis, any peer
   can perform state updates.  This is possible because a chain-of-trust
   is expected between NSIS nodes.  If this weren't the case, e.g., true
   resource reservations would not be possible; one misbehaving or
   compromised node would effectively break everything.  Thus, currently
   the NSIS protocols do not limit the roles of each NSIS signaling peer
   on a path, and any node can make updates.  Yet, some updates are
   reflected back to the signaling end points, and they can decide
   whether the signaling actually succeeded, or not.

   7.  Dead peer and invalid NR problem

   When the MN is on the path of a signaling exchange, after handover
   the old AR can not forward NSLP messages any further to the MN.  In
   this case, the old AR's mobility or routing protocol, or even the
   NSLP may trigger an error message to indicate that the last node
   fails or is truncated.  This error message is forwarded and may
   mistakenly cause the removal of the state on the existing common
   path, if the state is not updated before the error message is
   propagated through the signaling peers.  This is called the 'invalid
   NR problem'.

   NSIS solution: In general, a QNE should be conservative when it
   receives an indication for a state removal caused by a change in
   routing.  The QoS NSLP uses retransmissions and the RSN value to cope
   with the problem - see the QoS NSLP specification for more details.

   8.  IP-in-IP Encapsulation

   Mobility protocols may use IP-in-IP encapsulation on the segment of
   the end-to-end path for routing traffic from the CN to the MN, and
   vice versa.  Encapsulation harms any attempt to identify and filter
   data traffic belonging to, for example, a QoS reservation.  Moreover,
   encapsulation of data traffic may lead to changes in the routing
   paths since the source and the destination IP addresses of the inner
   header differ from those of the outer header.  Mobile IP uses
   tunneling mechanisms to forward data packets among end hosts.
   Traversing over the tunnel, NSIS signaling messages are transparent
   on the tunneling path due to the change of flow's addresses.  In case
   of interworking with Mobile IP-tunneling, CRNs can be discovered on
   the tunneling path.  It enables NSIS protocols to perform State



Sanda (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 25, 2008                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility          February 2008


   Update procedure over the IP-tunnel.  In this case, GIST needs to
   cope with the change of Message Routing Information (MRI) for the CRN
   discovery on the tunnel.  Also, NSLP signaling needs to determine
   when to remove the tunneling segment on the signaling path and/or how
   to tear down the old state via interworking with the IP-tunneling
   operation.

   NSIS solution: If the signaling packets are encapsulated it is
   necessary to perform a separate signaling exchange for the tunneled
   region.  Furthermore, a binding is needed to tie the end-to-end and
   tunneled session together.  The QoS NSLP implements this session
   binding.

   In addition to the above-mentioned issues, multihoming and key
   management related to handovers bring along additional questions.
   However, these are deemed out of scope of this document.  Also,
   practical implementations typically need various APIs across
   components within a node.  API issues, e.g., APIs from GIST to the
   various mobility and routing schemes, are also out of scope of this
   work.  The generic GIST API towards NSLP is flexible enough to
   fulfill most mobility-related needs of the NSLP layer.

4.  Basic Operations for Mobility Support

   In this section, the basic operations of the NSIS protocol suite
   needed after mobility related route changes are discussed.  There may
   be two possible ways of operations:

      - Option 1: GIST probes the route change by its periodical
      internal refreshes, then use NetworkNotification() API primitive
      to notify NSLPs to update their corresponding state.  Here the
      operation may be incomplete before an end-to-end signaling is
      accomplished.

      - Option 2: Upon a handover event (e.g., acquisition of a new IP
      address in the MN, or update of the binding cache in the HA or the
      CN, as it will be discussed in Section 5), each NSLP updates its
      signaling state in the reflected path.  For generality this option
      is preferred as it eventually accomplishes the signaling
      procedure, no matter whether optimization is encountered.

   In both options, as the primary task of signaling will be performed
   in the NSLP layer, and the NSLP operation is of particular
   importance.  In order to illustrate this the following subsection
   presents an example of QoS NSLP signaling for data traffic from the
   MN to the CN in the Mobile IPv6 route optimization mode, following
   the second option approach.

   Furthermore, optimization of the signaling procedure may be used, to
   reduce the unnecessary signaling overhead and to minimize the
   processing.  To optimize the signaling, two issues are identified,
   namely how to discover an appropriate CRN and how to perform the
   localized signaling (or so-called State Update) according to the
   direction of data flows.

4.1.  Basic operation example

   The following figure illustrates an example of QoS NSLP signaling in
   a Mobile IPv6 route optimization case, for the data flow from the MN
   to the CN, where sender-initiated reservation is used.  Once a
   handover event is detected in the MN, the MN issues a QoS NSLP
   RESERVE message towards the CN, which carries the unique session ID
   and other identification information for the session, as well as the
   reservation requirements.  Upon receipt of the RESERVE message, the
   QoS NSLP nodes (which will be discovered by the underlying NTLP)
   establish the corresponding QoS NSLP state, and forward the message
   towards the CN.  When there is already an existing NSLP state with
   the same session ID, the state will be updated.  If all the QoS NSLP
   nodes along the path support the required QoS, the CN in turn
   responds with a RESPONSE message, to confirm the reservation.

   In the bi-directional tunneling case, the only difference is that the
   RESERVE message should be sent to the HA instead of the CN, and the
   node which responds with a RESPONSE should be the HA instead of the
   CN too.  More details are discussed in Section 5

   Therefore, for the basic operation there is no fundamental difference
   among different operation modes of Mobile IP, and the main issue of
   mobility support in NSIS is to trigger NSLP signaling appropriately
   when a handover event is detected, and the destination of the NSLP
   signaling shall follow the Mobile IP data path as being path-coupled
   signaling.

   In this process, the obsoleted state in the old path is not
   explicited released.  To speed up the process, there is possibility
   to localize the signaling to speed this process.  When the RESERVE
   message reaches a node, depicted as CRN in this document, where a
   state is determined for the first time to reflect the same session,
   the node may issue a NOTIFY message towards the MN's old CoA.  The
   QNE adjacent to MN's old position stops the NOTIFY message, and sends
   RESERVE message (with Teardown bit set) towards the CN, to release
   the obsoleted state.  This RESERVE with tear message is stopped by
   the CRN.  More details are described in Section 4.2

   These topological changes caused by mobility make the NSIS state
   established in the old path useless.  It may need to be removed (in
   the end) as soon as possible.  In addition, NSIS state needs to be
   created along the new path and be updated along the common path.  The
   re-establishment of NSIS signaling may be localized when route

   changes (including mobility) occur to minimize the impact on the
   service and to avoid unnecessary signaling overhead.  This localized
   signaling procedure is referred to as State Update (refer to the
   terminology section).  In mobile environments, for example, the NSLP/
   NTLP needs to limit the scope of signaling information only to the
   affected portion of the signaling path because the signaling path in
   the wireless access network usually changes only partially.

   One of the most appropriate nodes to perform the State Update is the
   CRN where the old and new signaling paths meet.  The CRN should be
   the logical merging point, not physical one.  In the end, CRN
   discovery can be a crucial element to alleviate the double
   reservation and end-to-end signaling problems identified in
   Section 3.

4.2.1.  CRN Discovery

   The CRN is discoved at NSLP layer.  In case of QoS NSLP, when a
   RESERVE message with an existing SESSION_ID is received and its
   Source Identification Information (SII) and MRI are changed, the QNE
   knows its upstream or downstream peer has changed by handover, for
   sender-oriented and receiver-oriented reservations, respectively.
   And realizes it is implicitly the CRN.

4.2.2.  Localized State Update

   Before initiating the State Update, the MN or the CN needs to acquire
   necessary authentication and authorization for the corresponding
   state operation.  The MN or the CN may also check the availability of
   resources on the new path.  In case of QoS NSLP, the QUERY message
   can be used to find the availability of resources in the networks
   (e.g., access networks or core networks).  If the resources along the
   new path are not sufficient, it may be needed to keep the state
   established previously using multihomed interfaces while blocking
   incoming new requests.

   In the downstream State Update, if resources are available, the MN
   initiates the full RESERVE with a new RSN for state setup toward a CN
   and also the implicit DCRN discovery is performed by the procedure of
   signaling as described in Section 4.2.1.  The MRI from the DCRN to
   the CN (i.e., common path) is updated by the RESERVE message.  DCRN
   may also send NOTIFY with "Route change (0x02)" to previous upstream
   peer.  The NOTIFY is forwarded hop-by-hop and reaches to the edge QNE
   (i.e., QNE1 in Figure 1).  After the QNE is aware that the MN as QNI
   is disappeard, the QNE sends tearing RESERVE towards downstream.
   When the tearing RESERVE reaches to the DCRN, the DCRN stops
   forwarding and drops it.  Note that, however, it is not necessary for
   GIST state to be explicitly removed because of the inexpensiveness of



Sanda (Ed.), et al.      Expires August 25, 2008               [Page 15]

   the state maintenance at the GIST layer [1].  Note that, the sender-
   initiated approach leads to faster setup than the receiver-initiated
   approach as in RSVP [5].

   In the scenario of an upstream State Update, there are two possible
   methods for state update.  One is the CN (or a HA/ a GFA/ a MAP)
   sends the refreshing RESERVE message toward the MN to perform State
   Update by receiving trigger (e.g., MIP binding update).  UCRN is
   discovered implicitly by the CN-initiated signaling along the common
   path as described in Section 4.2.1.  When the refreshing RESERVE
   reaches to the adjacent QNE of UCRN, the QNE sends back a RESPONSE
   saying "full QSPEC required".  Then the UCRN sends the full RESERVE
   towards the MN to set up a new reservation.  The UCRN may also send
   tearing RESERVE to previous downstream peer.  The tearing RESERVE is
   forwarded hop-by-hop and reaches to the edge QNE.  After the QNE is
   aware that the MN as QNI is disappeard, the QNE drops the tearing
   peer.  The other is, if GIST hop is already established on the new
   path (e.g. by QUERY from the CN ((or a HA/ a GFA/ a MAP))) when MN
   gets a hint from GIST that routing has changed, the MN sends a NOTIFY
   towards upstream saying "Route Change" 0x02.  When the NOTIFY hits
   UCRN, the UCRN is aware that the NOTIFY is for a known session comes
   from a new SII-Handle.  Then the UCRN sends a full RESERVE with a new
   RSN and an RII towards the MN.  By receiving full RESERVE, the MN
   replies RESPONSE.  The UCRN may also send tearing RESERVE to previous
   downstream peer.  The tearing RESERVE is forwarded hop-by-hop and
   reaches to the edge QNE.  After the QNE is aware that the MN as QNI
   is disappeard, the QNE drops the tearing peer.

   The State Update on the common path to reflect the changed MRI brings
   issues on the end-to-end signaling addressed in Section 3.  Although
   the State Update over the common path does not give rise to re-
   processing of AAA and admission control, it may lead to the increased
   signaling overhead and latency.

   One of the goals of the State Update is to avoid the double
   reservation on the common path as described in Section 3.  The double
   reservation problem on the common path can be solved by establishing
   a signaling association using a unique SID and by updating packet
   classifier/flow identifier.  In this case, even though the flows on
   the common path have different flow dentifiers, it keeps same NSLP
   state.

5.  Interaction with Mobile IPv4/v6

   In Mobile IP scenario, there are two types of data routings, one is
   triangular routing with tunneling section, and the other is optimized
   routing which is direct routing between an MN and a CN.  This section
   analyzes NSIS operation with these data routes.

5.1.  Interaction with Mobile IPv4

   In Mobile IPv4 [6], the data flows are forwarded based on triangular
   routing, and an MN retains a new CoA from the FA (or an external
   method such as DHCP) in the visited access network.  When the MN acts
   as a data sender, the data and signaling flows sent from the MN are
   directly transferred to the CN not necessarily through the HA or
   indirectly through the HA using the reverse routing.  On the other
   hand, when the MN act as a data receiver, the data and signaling
   flows sent from the CN are routed through the IP tunneling between
   the HA and the FA (or the HA and the MN in case of the Co-located
   CoA).  With this approach, routing is dependent on the HA, and
   therefore the NSIS protocols interact with the IP tunneling procedure
   of Mobile IP for signaling.

   The Figure 3 (a) to (e) show the NSIS signaling flows depending on
   the direction of the data flows and the routing methods.

   (c)), the MN performs the CRN discovery (DCRN) and the State Update
   toward the CN (as described in Section 4) to establish the NSIS state
   along the new path between the MN and the CN.  In case reverse tunnel
   is not used (Figure 3 (a)), a new NSIS state is established on direct
   path from the MN to the CN.  If the reverse tunnel and FA CoA are
   used (Figure 3 (b)), a new NSIS state is established along a
   tunneling path from the FA to the HA separately from end-to-end path.
   CRN discovery and State Update in tunneling path is also separately
   performed if necessary.  If the reverse tunnel and co-located CoA are
   used (Figure 3 (c)) the NSIS signaling for the DCRN discovery and the
   State Update is the same as the case of using FA CoA above except for
   the use of the reverse tunneling path from the MN to the HA.  That
   is, in this case, one of tunnel end points is the MN, not the FA.

   When an MN (as a signaling receiver) arrives at a new FA and the
   corresponding binding process is completed (Figure 3 (d) and (e)),
   the MN sends NOFITY message to the signaling sender, i.e., the CN.
   In case FA CoA is used (Figure 3 (d)), the CN initiates a NSIS
   signaling to update an existing state between the CN and the HA, and
   afterwards the NSIS signaling messages are forwarded to the FA and
   reaches to the MN.  A new NSIS state is established along the
   tunneling path from the HA to the FA separately from end-to-end path.
   During this operation, a UCRN is discovered on the tunneling path,
   and a new flow identifier for the State Update on the tunnel may need
   to be created.  CRN discovery and State Update in tunneling path is
   also separately performed if necessary.  In case collocated CoA is
   used (Figure 3 (d)) the NSIS signaling for the UCRN discovery and the
   State Update is also the same as the case of using FA CoA above
   except for the end point of tunneling path from the HA to the MN.

   Note that Mobile IPv4 optionally supports route optimization.  In the
   case route optimization is supported, the signaling operation will be
   the same as Mobile IPv6 route optimization.

5.2.  Interaction with Mobile IPv6

   Unlike Mobile IPv4, with Mobile IPv6 [7], the FA is not required on
   the data path.  If an MN moves to visited network, a CoA at the
   network is allocated like co-located CoA in Mobile IPv4.  In
   addition, the route optimization process between the MN and CN can be
   used to avoid the triangular routing in the Mobile IPv4 scenarios.

   If the use of route optimization is not mandatory, data flow routing
   and NSIS signaling procedures (including the CRN discovery and the
   State Update) will be similar to the case of using the Mobile IPv4
   with co-located CoA.  However, if Route Optimization is used,
   signaling messages are sent directly from the MN to the CN, or from
   the CN to the MN.  Therefore, route change procedures described in

   Section 4 are applicable to this case.

5.3.  Interaction with Mobile IP tunneling

   In this section, we assume that MN acts as a signaling sender and CN
   acts as a signaling receiver in interworking between Mobile IP and
   NSIS signaling.

   Scenarios for interaction with Mobile IP tunneling vary depending on:

      - Whether a tunneling entry point (Tentry) is an MN or other node.
      In case Mobile IPv4 co-located CoA or Mobile IPv6, Tentry is an
      MN.  In case Mobile IPv4 FA CoA case, Tentry is a FA.  In both
      case, a HA is tunneling exit point (Texit).

      - Whether the mode of QoS-NSLP signaling is sender-initiated or
      receiver initiated.

      - Whether the signaling mode over tunnel is sequential mode or
      parallel mode.  In sequential mode, end-to-end signaling pauses
      when it is waiting for results of tunnel signaling, and resumes
      upon receipt of the tunnel signaling outcome.  In parallel mode,
      end-to-end signaling continues outside the tunnel while tunnel
      signaling is still in process and its outcome is unknown [8].

   The following subsection describes sender-initiated and receiver-
   initiated reservation with Mobile IP tunneling and CRN discovery and
   State Update with Mobile IP tunneling.

5.3.1.  Sender-Initiated Reservation with Mobile IP tunnel

   The following scenario assumes that a FA is a Tentry.  However the
   procedure is the same for the case an MN is a Tently if it is
   considered that the MN and the FA are the same node.

      - When an MN moves into a new network attachment point, QoS- NSLP
      in the MN initiates RESERVE (end-to-end) message to start the
      State Update procedure.  The GIST below the QoS-NSLP adds GIST
      header and then sends the encapsulated RESERVE message to peer
      GIST node with corresponding QoS-NSLP for DCRN discovery.  In this
      case, the peer GIST node is a FA if the FA is an NSIS-aware node.
      The FA is one of the endpoints of Mobile IP tunneling: Tentry.  In
      case of interaction with tunnel signaling originated from the FA,
      there can be two scenarios depending on whether NSIS signaling
      interacts with the Mobile IP tunneling.  The first scenario is
      that the NSIS signaling is discerned on the tunneling path between
      the FA and corresponding HA, and then the tunneling path becomes
      an NSIS-aware cloud.  The second one is otherwise, and here the

      tunneling path is transparent as a logical link to NSIS signaling
      [8].

      - In the NSIS-aware tunneling scenarios, as shown in Figure 4 and
      Figure 5, upon receiving the RESERVE message from the MN, the QoS-
      NSLP of FA explicitly creates a new RESERVE-t (tunnel) message,
      which keeps the existing (end-to-end) Session ID and includes a
      new (tunneling) Flow ID different from the (end-to-end) flow ID,
      to distinguish the NSIS signaling messages over the Mobile IPv4
      tunneling path.  The RESERVE-t message is forwarded toward HA,
      another end point of Mobile IPv4 tunneling.  Also, after receiving
      the RESERVE-t message from the FA, the HA should decide whether it
      needs to initiate a RESPONSE-t (tunnel) message toward FA for
      responding to the RESERVE-t message, or make the RESPONSE-t
      message wait until a RSESPONSE message, which is created to react
      the RESERVE message, arrives from the CN.

      - In this procedure of NSIS-tunnel signaling, again, two
      categories of tunnel signaling mode are taken into consideration,
      i.e., either sequential or parallel mode.

      - Provided that the tunnel signaling mode is sequential as shown
      in Figure 4, the RESERVE signaling toward the HA resumes after
      confirming completeness of NSIS tunnel signaling through the
      RESERVE-t and the RESPONSE-t messages.  Arriving at HA, the
      RESERVE message is forwarded to CN to update or refresh the
      existing NSIS states (QoS-NSLP and GIST) on the common path.  The
      CN initiates a RESPONSE message, responding to the RESERVE
      message, toward the HA as its destination.  The HA forwards the
      RESPONSE message to the FA after encapsulating the message.
      Finally, the RESPONSE message is sent to MN after being
      decapsulated at the FA.  Note that both end-to-end signaling
      messages, the RESPONSE and the RESERVE messages, are not
      discernible on the tunneling path, like a logical link, and those
      messages just play a role of NSIS signaling for establishing end-
      to-end state.

      - Provided that the tunnel signaling mode is parallel as shown in
      Figure 5, upon receiving the RESERVE message from the MN, the FA
      forwards it to the HA at the drop of a hat.  Also, arriving at the
      HA from the CN, the RESPONSE message is again forwarded from the
      HA to the FA regardless of the delivery of RESPONSE-t message.
      Since in this parallel mode the end-to-end signaling messages do
      not reconcile with both NSIS-tunnel signaling messages, the
      RESERVE-t and RESPONSE-t messages, the tunneling path operates
      like a logical link and thus NON-QoS-HOP flag is set within the
      RESERVE message although NSIS-tunnel signaling messages are
      available on the tunnel path.

     Figure 7: Receiver-Initiated QoS NSLP over Tunnel - Parallel Mode

5.3.3.  CRN discovery and State Update with Mobile IP tunneling

   Interaction with Mobile IP tunneling scenario can define two types of
   CRNs, i.e., a CRN on end-to-end path and a CRN on tunneling path.
   CRN discovery and State Update for these two paths are operated
   independently.

   CRN discovery for end-to-end path is initiated by the MN by sending
   RESERVE (sender-initiated case) or QUERY (receiver-initiated case)
   message.  As MN uses HoA as source address even after handover, a CRN
   is found by normal route change process (i.e., the same SID and FID,
   but different SII handle).  If a HA is QoS-NSLP aware, the HA is
   found as the CRN.  The CRN initiate tearing process on the old path
   as described in [2]

6.  Further Studies

   This section introduces potential issues and possible approaches for
   complicated scenarios in the mobile environment, i.e., peer failure
   scenarios, multihomed scenarios, and interworking with other mobility
   protocols.  Topics in this section are out-of-scope of this document,
   and detailed operations are not discussed.  All topics are for future
   studies.

6.1.  NSIS Operation in the multihomed mobile environment

   In multihomed mobile environments, multiple interfaces and addresses
   (i.e., CoAs and HoAs) are available.  This case, two major issues can
   be considered.  One is how to select or acquire the most appropriate
   interface(s) and/or address(es) from end-to-end QoS point of view.
   The other is, when multiple paths are simultaneously used for load-
   balancing purpose, how to differentiate and manage two types of CRNs,
   i.e., CRN between two on-going Paths (LB-CRN: Load Balancing CRN) and
   CRN between the old and new paths caused by MN's handover (HO-CRN:
   Handover CRN).  This section introduces possible approaches for these
   issues.

6.1.1.  Selecting the best interface(s)/CoA(s)

   In MIPv6 route optimization case, if multiple CoAs registration is
   provided [10], the contents of QUERYs sent by candidate CoAs can be
   used to select the best interface(s)/CoA(s).

   Assume that an MN is a data sender and has multiple interfaces.  Now
   the MN moves to a new location and acquires CoA(s) for multiple
   interfaces.  After the MN performs the BU/BA procedure, it sends
   QUERY messages toward the CN through the interface(s) associated with
   the CoA(s).  On receiving the QUERY messages, the CN or Gateway,
   determines the best (primary) CoA(s) by checking 'QoS available'
   field in the QUERY messages.  Then a RESERVE message is sent toward
   the MN to reserve resources along the path the primary CoA takes.  If
   the reservation is not successful, the CN transmits another RESERVE
   message using the CoA with the next highest priority.  The CRN may
   initiate a teardown (RESERVE with the TEAR flag set) message toward
   old access router (OAR) to release the reserved resources on the old
   path.

   In case of sender-initiated reservation, a similar approach is
   possible.  That is, the QUERY and RESERVE messages are initiated by
   an MN, and the MN selects the Primary CoA based on the information
   delivered by the QUERY message.

6.1.2.  Differentiation of two types of CRNs

   When multiple interfaces of the MN are simultaneously used for load-
   balancing purpose, a possible approach for distinguishing LB-CRN and
   HO-CRN will introduce an identifier to determine the relationship
   between interfaces and paths.

   An MN uses interface 1 and interface 2 for the same session, where
   the paths (say path 1 and path 2) have the same SID but different
   FIDs as shown in (a) of Figure 9.  Now one of the interfaces of MN
   performs a handover and obtains a new CoA, the MN will try to
   establish a new path (say Path 3) with the new FID, as shown in (b)
   of Figure 9.  In this case the CRN between path 2 and path 3 cannot
   determine if it is LB-CRN or HO-CRN since for both cases, SID is the
   same but FIDs are different.  Hence the CRN will not know if State
   Update is required.  One possible solution to solve this issue will
   introduce path classification identifier which shows the relationship
   between interfaces and paths.  For example, signaling messages and
   QNEs belong to paths from interface 1 and interface 2 carry the
   identifier '00' and '02', respectively.  By having this identifier,

   the CRN between path 2 and path 3 will be able to determine whether
   it is LB-CRN or HO-CRN.  For example, if path 3 carries '00', the CRN
   is LB-CRN, and if '01', the CRN is HO-CRN.

6.2.  Interworking with other mobility protocols

   Unlike the generic route changes, in mobility scenarios, the end-to-
   end signaling problem by the State Update gives rise to the
   degradation of network performance, e.g., increased signaling
   overhead, service blackout, and so on.  To reduce signaling latency
   in the Mobile IP-based scenarios, the NSIS protocol suite may need to
   interwork with localized mobility management (LMM).  If the GIST/NSLP
   (QoS-NSLP or NAT/FW-NSLP) protocols interact with Hierarchical Mobile
   IPv6 and the CRN is discovered between an MN and an MAP, the State
   Update can be localized by address mapping.  However, how the State
   Update is performed with scoped signaling messages within the access
   network under the MAP is for future study.

Internet-Draft         NSIS Signaling in Mobility          February 2008


   In the inter-domain handover, a possible way to mitigate the latency
   penalty is to use the multi-homed MN.  It is also possible to allow
   the NSIS protocols to interact with mobility protocols such as
   Seamoby protocols (e.g., CARD [RFC4066] and CXTP [RFC4067]) and FMIP.
   Another scenario is to use peering agreement which allows aggregation
   authorization to be performed for aggregate reservation on an inter-
   domain link without authorizing each individual session.  How these
   approaches can be used in NSIS signaling is for further study.

6.3.  Intermediate node becomes a dead peer

   The failure of a (potential) NSIS CRN may result in incomplete state
   re-establishment on the new path and incomplete teardown on the old
   path after handover.  In this case, a new CRN should be re-discovered
   immediately by the CRN discovery procedure.

   The failure of an AR may make the interactions with Seamoby protocols
   (such as CARD and CXTP) impossible.  In this case, the neighboring
   peer closest to the dead AR may need to interact with such protocols.
   A more detailed analysis of interactions with Seamoby protocols is
   left for future work.

   In Mobile IP-based scenarios, the failures of NSIS functions at an FA
   and an HA may result in incomplete interaction with IP-tunneling.  In
   this case, recovery for NSIS functions needs to be performed
   immediately.  In addtion, a more detailed analysis of interactions
   with IP-tunneling is left for future work.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security concerns.  The security
   considerations pertaining to the standard NSIS protocol
   specifications [gist, qos-nslp, natfw-nslp] remain relevant.  When
   deployed in service provider networks, it is mandatory to ensure that
   only authorized entities are permitted to initiate re-establishment
   and removal of NSIS states in mobile environments, including the use
   of NSIS proxies.

10.  Contributors

   Sung-Hyuck Lee was the first editor of the draft.  Since version 06
   of the draft, Takako Sanda has taken the editorship.

   Many individuals have contributed to this draft.  Since it was not
   possible to list them all in the authors section, this section was
   created to have a sincere respect for other authors, Paulo Mendes,
   Robert Hancock, Roland Bless and Shivanajay Marwaha.  Separating
   authors into two groups was done without treating any one of them
   better (or worse) than others.

Appendix A.

   The mobility occurs due to the change of the network attachment
   point, but the generic route changes is associated with load sharing,
   load balancing, or a link (or node) failure.  These cause divergence
   (or convergence) between the old path along which state has already
   been installed and the new path along which data forwarding will
   actually happen.

   The route changes brings on the change of signaling topology and it
   results in difference according to the types of route changes (e.g.,
   the route changes or mobility).  The route changes generally forms
   two common paths, an old path, and a new path, where the old path and
   the new path begin to diverge from one common path and afterward to
   converge to another common path for each direction of signaling flows
   (e.g., downstream or upstream flows) as shown in Figure 10

Appendix B.

   As described in 7 of Section 3, An old AR may trigger for tearing
   down whole path before RESERVE from new location reaches to CRN.
   NSIS approach is that GIST is conservative and careful in indicating
   peer failure to the NSLP in mobile network.

   Another possible implementation approach to enhance the operation is
   that the MN informs AR (as adjacent QNE) or the CRN (including, HA
   and MAP) of its' handover with some sort of policy beforehand or
   afterward.  Such a policy could, for example, indicate how it should
   be processed in case the MN suddenly moves away, or how long the AR
   may keep the QoS state after AR detects MN's handover (e.g., 30 sec.,
   or until the MN moves back).  In this case, the AR can be a proxy for
   the MN (the last node) and it may be able to send RESPONSE messages
   in response to REFRESH (or RESERVE) messages from an upstream node as
   well as avoid causing unnecessary teardown.  Still other possible
   approach for latter case is the MN implicitly indicates which
   massages are sent from the latest location, e.g., the MN may embed a
   parameter to show the number of handover in the massages.  By
   comparing these numbers, the CRN can detect the latest massage and
   avoid confusion.
