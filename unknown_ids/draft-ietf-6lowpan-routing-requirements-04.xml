<!--================ PROBLEM STATEMENT===============-->

		<section anchor="problems" title="Problem Statement">
			<t>
				6LoWPANs are formed by devices that are compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4
				standard <xref target="refs.IEEE802.15.4"/>.
                                Most of the LoWPAN devices are distinguished by their low bandwidth,
				short range, scarce memory
				capacity, limited processing capability and other attributes of
				inexpensive hardware.  The characteristics of nodes
				participating in LoWPANs are assumed to be those described in the 6LoWPAN problem statement <xref target="RFC4919"/>,
				and the IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4 <xref target="RFC4944"/> document which has specified
				how to carry IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 and similar networks.
			</t>
			<t>
				IEEE 802.15.4 networks support star and mesh topologies.
				However, neither the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the 6LoWPAN format
				specification (<xref target="RFC4944"/>) define
				how mesh topologies could be obtained and maintained. Thus, 6LoWPAN
				formation and multi-hop routing should be supported by either at below IP layer (the adaptation layer or LLC)
				or the IP layer. A number of IP routing protocols have been developed in various
				IETF working groups. However, these existing routing protocols may not
				satisfy the requirements of multi-hop routing in 6LoWPANs, for the following
				reasons:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>
						6LoWPAN nodes have special types and roles, such as nodes drawing their power from primary batteries,
						power-affluent nodes, mains-powered and high-performance gateways,
						data aggregators, etc. 6LoWPAN routing protocols should support multiple device types
						and roles.
					</t>
					<t>
						More stringent requirements apply to LoWPANs, as opposed
						to higher performance or non-battery-operated networks.
						6LoWPAN nodes are characterized by small memory sizes,
						low processing power, and are running on very limited power supplied
						by primary non-rechargeable batteries (a few KBytes of RAM,
						a few dozens of KBytes of ROM/flash memory, and a few MHz of CPU is
						typical).  A node's lifetime is usually defined by the lifetime of
						its battery.
					</t>
					<t>
						Handling sleeping nodes is very critical in LoWPANs, more than in
						traditional ad-hoc networks. LoWPAN nodes might stay in sleep mode
						for most of the time. Taking advantage of appropriate times for
						transmissions is important for efficient packet forwarding.
					</t>
					<t>
						Routing in 6LoWPANs might possibly translate to a simpler problem
						than routing in higher-performance networks. LoWPANs might be either
						transit networks or stub networks.  Under the assumption that LoWPANs
						are never transit networks (as implied by <xref target="RFC4944"/>),
						routing protocols may be drastically simplified.
						This document will focus on the requirements for stub
						networks. Additional requirements may apply to transit networks.
					</t>
					<t>
						Routing in LoWPANs might possibly translate to a harder problem
						than routing in higher-performance networks. Routing in LoWPANs
						requires power optimization, stable operation in lossy environments,
						data-aware routing, etc.  These requirements are not easily
						satisfiable all at once <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-protocols-survey"/>.
					</t>
				</list>

				 These properties create new challenges on obtaining robust and reliable routing within LoWPANs.
			</t>

			<t>
				The 6LoWPAN problem statement document ("6LoWPAN Problems and Goals" <xref target="RFC4919"/>)
				briefly mentions four requirements on routing protocols:
				<list>
					<t>(a) low overhead on data packets</t>
					<t>(b) low routing overhead</t>
					<t>(c) minimal memory and computation requirements</t>
					<t>(d) support for sleeping nodes considering battery saving</t>
				</list>
				These four high-level requirements describe the basic requirements for 6LoWPAN routing.
				Based on the fundamental features of 6LoWPAN, more detailed routing requirements
				are presented in this document, which can lead to further analysis and protocol design.
			</t>
			<t>
				Considering the problems above, detailed 6LoWPAN routing requirements
				must be defined.  Application-specific features affect the design of
				6LoWPAN routing requirements and the corresponding solutions.
				However, various applications can be profiled by similar technical
				characteristics, although the related detailed requirements might differ
				(e.g., a few dozens of nodes in a home lighting system need appropriate
				scalability for its applications, while millions of nodes for a
				highway infrastructure system also need appropriate scalability).
			</t>
			<t>
				This routing requirements document states the routing requirements of 6LoWPAN
				applications in general, providing examples for different cases of routing.
				It does not imply a single routing solution to be favorable for all 6LoWPAN applications.

					</t>
				</list>

		</section>

<!--=============== DESIGN SPACE ==============-->

		<section title="Design Space">
			<t>
				Apart from a wide variety of conceivable routing algorithms for 6LoWPAN,
				it is possible to perform routing in the IP-layer, using a Route Over approach 
				or in the adaptation layer defined by the
				6LoWPAN format document <xref target="RFC4944"/>, using the Mesh Under approach (see <xref target="NetworkStack"/>).
			</t>
			<t>
				The Route Over approach relies on IP routing and therefore supports
				routing over possibly various types of interconnected links.
				<vspace/>
				Note: The ROLL WG is now working on Route Over approaches for Low power
				and Lossy Networks (LLNs), not specifically for 6LoWPAN.
                This document focuses on 6LoWPAN-specific requirements; it may be used in
				conjunction with the more application-oriented requirements defined by the ROLL WG.
			</t>
			<t>	
				The Mesh Under approach performs the multi-hop communication below the IP link.
				The most significant consequence of Mesh Under mechanism is that
				the characteristics of IEEE 802.15.4 directly affect the 6LoWPAN routing mechanisms,
				including the use of 64-bit (or 16-bit short) MAC addresses instead of IP
				addresses.  A 6LoWPAN would therefore be seen as a single IP link.
			</t>
			<t>
				Most statements in this	document consider both the Route Over and Mesh Under cases.

			<t>
				In order to avoid packet fragmentation and the overhead for reassembly,
				routing packets should fit into a single IEEE 802.15.4 physical frame
				and application data should not be expanded to an extent that they
				no longer fit.
			</t>

		<!--================================-->
        <section title="Reference Network Model">
			<t>
				For multi-hop communication in 6LoWPAN, when a Route Over mechanism is in use,
				all LoWPAN Routers perform IP routing within the stub network.
				Not only the ER but also other intermediate nodes become LoWPAN Routers and perform 
				standard Layer 3 (IP) routing (see <xref target="x6LoWPAN-rover-conf"/>).
				In this case, the link-local scope covers the set of nodes within symmetric radio range of a node.
			</t>
			<t> <!--some text changes, feb 17,2009-->
				 When a 6LoWPAN follows the Mesh Under configuration,
				 the LoWPAN Edge Router (ER) is the only IPv6 router in the 6LoWPAN (see <xref target="x6LoWPAN-mesh-conf"/>).
                 This means that the IPv6 link-local scope includes all nodes in the LoWPAN.
				 For this, a Mesh Under mechanism MUST be provided to support multi-hop transmission.

				When multiple 6LoWPANs are formed with globally unique IPv6 addresses
				in the 6LoWPANs, and node (a) of 6LoWPAN [A] wants to communicate
				with node (b) of 6LoWPAN [B], the normal IPv6 mechanisms will be employed.
				For Route Over, the IPv6 address of (b) is set as the destination of the packets, and
				the nodes perform IP routing to the ER for these outgoing packets.
				Additionally, a default route to the ER could be inserted into the 6LoWPAN routing system.
				For Mesh Under, there is one IP hop from a node (a) to ER of [A],
				no matter how many radio hops they are apart from each other. This, of course, assumes
				the existence of a Mesh Under routing protocol in order to reach the ER.

        <section title="6LoWPAN Headers for Routing">
			<t>
				When a Route Over mechanism is built over the IPv6 layer, the Dispatch value
				can be chosen as one of the Dispatch patterns for 6LoWPAN, followed by a compressed
				or uncompressed IPv6 header, and Route Over routing header will be included in the payload of IPv6 packet.
				The 6LoWPAN compression format for IPv6 Datagrams <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc"/> 
				includes next header compression (NHC) and the routing header could be followed by NHC.

				In the simplest case for a Mesh Under where layer two forwarding can

			<t>
				IP-based LoWPAN technology is still in its early stage of
				development, but the range of conceivable usage scenarios is
				tremendous.  The numerous possible applications of sensor networks
				make it obvious that mesh topologies will be prevalent in LoWPAN
				environments and robust routing will be a necessity for expedient
				communication.  Research efforts in the area of sensor networking
				have put forth a large variety of multi-hop routing algorithms
				<xref target="refs.bulusu"/>.
				Most related work focuses on optimizing
				routing for specific application scenarios, which can be realized using
				several models of communication, including the following ones <xref target="refs.cctc"/>:
				<list style="symbols">

				   <t>Self-organizing coordinate routing</t>
				</list>
				Depending on the topology of a LoWPAN and the application(s) running over it,
				different types of routing may be used. However, this document abstracts from
				application-specific communication and describes general routing requirements
				valid for overall routing in LoWPANs.
			</t>
			<t>
				The following parameters can be used to describe specific scenarios
				in which the candidate routing protocols could be evaluated.
			</t>
      <t>
			<list style="letters">
				<t>Network Properties:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>
						Number of Devices, Density and Network Diameter: <vspace/>
						These parameters usually affect the routing state directly
						(e.g. the number of entries in a routing table or neighbor
						list).  Especially in large and dense networks, policies must
						be applied for discarding "low-quality" and stale routing
						entries in order to prevent memory overflow.
					</t>
					<t>
						Connectivity: <vspace/>
						Due to external factors or programmed disconnections, a LoWPAN
						can be in several states of connectivity; anything in the
						range from "always connected" to "rarely connected".  This
						poses great challenges to the dynamic discovery of routes
						across a LoWPAN.
					</t>
					<t>
						Dynamicity (including mobility): <vspace/>
						Location changes can be induced by unpredictable external
						factors or by controlled motion, which may in turn cause route
						changes.  Also, nodes may dynamically be introduced into a
						LoWPAN and removed from it later.  The routing state and the
						volume of control messages may heavily depend on the number
						of moving nodes in a LoWPAN and their speed, as well as how quickly and frequently environmental characteristics influencing radio propagation change.
					</t>
					<t>
						Deployment: <vspace/>
						In a LoWPAN, it is possible for nodes to be scattered randomly
						or to be deployed in an organized manner.  The deployment can
						occur at once, or as an iterative process, which may also
						affect the routing state.
					</t>
					<t>
						Spatial Distribution of Nodes and Gateways: <vspace/>
						Network connectivity depends on the spatial distribution of the nodes,
						and on other factors such as device number, density and transmission
						range. For instance, nodes can be placed on a grid, or can be randomly placed in
						an area (as can be modeled by a bidimensional Poisson distribution), etc.
						In addition, if the LoWPAN is connected to other networks through
						infrastructure nodes called gateways, the number and spatial
						distribution of gateways affects network congestion and available
						data rate, among others.
					</t>
					<t>
						Traffic Patterns, Topology and Applications: <vspace/>
						The design of a LoWPAN and the requirements on its application
						have a big impact on the network topology and the most efficient routing type to be
						used.  For different traffic patterns (point-to-point,
						multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint) and network
						architectures, various routing mechanisms have been
						developed, such as data-aware, event-driven, address-centric,
						and geographic routing.
					</t>
					<t>
						Classes of Service: <vspace/>
						For mixing applications of different criticality on one LoWPAN, support of multiple classes of
						service may be required in resource-constrained LoWPANs and may
						require a certain degree of routing protocol overhead.
					</t>
					<t>
						Security: <vspace/>
						LoWPANs may carry sensitive information and require a high
						level of security support where the availability, integrity,
						and confidentiality of data are of prime relevance.  Secured messages
						cause overhead and affect the power consumption of LoWPAN
						routing protocols.

		<section anchor="Requirements" title="6LoWPAN Routing Requirements">
			<t>
				This section defines a list of requirements for 6LoWPAN routing.
				An important design property specific to low-power networks is that LoWPANs
				have to support multiple device types and roles, such as:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>host nodes drawing their power from primary batteries or using energy harvesting (both called "power-constrained nodes" in the following)</t>
					<t>mains-powered host nodes (an example for what we call "power-affluent nodes")</t>
					<t>power-affluent (but not necessarily mains-powered) high-performance gateway(s)</t>
					<t>nodes with various functionality (data aggregators, relays, local manager/coordinators, etc.)</t>
				</list>

					Due to these different device types and roles LoWPANs need to consider
					the following two primary attributes:

				<list style="symbols">
					<t>
						Power conservation: some devices are mains-powered, but many are
						battery-operated and need to last several months to a few years
						with a single AA battery. Many devices are mains-powered most of
						the time, but still need to function for possibly extended periods
						from batteries (e.g. on a construction site before building power
						is switched on for the first time).
					</t>
					<t>
						Low performance: tiny devices, small memory sizes, low-performance
						processors, low bandwidth, high loss rates, etc.
					</t>
				</list>
				These fundamental attributes of LoWPANs affect the design of routing
				solutions. Whether existing routing specifications are
				simplified and modified, or new solutions are introduced in order to
				fit the low-power requirements of LoWPANs, they need to meet the requirements
				described in the following.
			</t>

        <!--====================================-->
		<!-- start of Section 4.1: Device -->
			<section anchor="reqs1" title="Support of 6LoWPAN Device Properties">
				<t>
					The general objectives listed in this section should be met
					by 6LoWPAN routing protocols. The importance of each requirement is
					dependent on what node type the protocol is running on and what
					the role of the node is. The following requirements consider the presence of battery-powered nodes in LoWPANs.
				</t>
				<t>
				    [R01] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD allow implementation with small code size
					and require low routing state to fit the typical 6LoWPAN node capacity.
                                        Generally speaking, the code size is bounded by available flash memory size, and the routing table is bounded by RAM size, possibly limiting it to less than 32 entries.
				</t>
        <t>
				<list>
					<t> <!-- R01: small code-->
            The RAM size of LoWPAN nodes often ranges between 4 KB (2 KB minimum) and 10 KB,
						and program flash memory normally consists of 48 KB to 128 KB.
						(e.g., in the current market, MICAz has 128 KB program flash,
						4 KB EEPROM, 512 KB external flash ROM; TIP700CM has 48 KB program
						flash, 10 KB RAM, 1 MB external flash ROM).
					</t>
					<t>
						Due to these hardware restrictions, code SHOULD
						fit within a small memory size; no more than 48 KB to 128 KB of flash memory including
						at least a few tens of KB of application code size.
						(As a general observation, a routing protocol of low
            complexity may help achieving
						the goal of reducing power consumption, improves robustness,
						requires lower routing state, is easier to analyze, and may be
						less prone to security attacks.)
					</t>
					<t>
						In addition, operation with limited amounts of routing state (such as routing tables and neighbor lists)
						SHOULD be maintained since some typical memory sizes preclude storing
						state of a large number of nodes. For instance, industrial monitoring applications
						may need to support at maximum 20 hops <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-indus-routing-reqs"/>.

						Small networks can be designed to support a smaller number of hops.
						While the need for this is highly dependent on the network architecture,
					        there should be at least one mode of operation that can
						function with 32 forwarding entries or less.
					</t>
				</list> <!-- end of R01-->
        </t>
				<t> <!-- R02: minimal power -->
				    [R02] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD cause minimal power
					consumption by the efficient use of control packets
					(e.g., minimize expensive IP multicast which causes link broadcast to the entire
					LoWPAN) and by the efficient routing of data packets.
				</t>
        <t>
				<list>
					<t>
						One way of battery lifetime optimization is by achieving a minimal
						control message overhead. Compared to functions such as
						computational operations or taking sensor samples, radio communications
						is by far the dominant factor of power consumption <xref target="refs.SmartDust"/>.
						Power consumption of transmission and/or reception depends linearly
						on the length of data units and	on the frequency of transmission
						and reception of the data units <xref target="refs.Shih"/>.
					</t>
					<t>
						The energy consumption of two
						example RF controllers for low-power nodes is shown in <xref target="refs.Hill"/>.
						The TR1000 radio consumes 21 mW when transmitting at 0.75 mW,
						and 15 mW on reception (with a receiver sensitivity of -85 dBm).
						The CC1000 consumes 31.6 mW when transmitting 0.75 mW, and 20 mW for receiving (with a receiver sensitivity
						of -105 dBm). The power endurance under the concept of
						an idealized power source is explained in <xref target="refs.Hill"/>.
						Based on the energy of an idealized AA battery,
						the CC1000 can transmit for approximately 4 days straight or receive
						for 9 consecutive days. Note that availability for reception consumes
						power as well.
					</t>
					<t>
						As multicast may cause flooding in the LoWPAN, a 6LoWPAN routing
						protocol SHOULD minimize the control cost by multicasting routing packets.
          </t>
          <t>
						Control cost of routing protocols in low power and lossy
            networks is discussed in more detail in <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-protocols-survey"/>.

					<t>
						In order to save energy, routing overhead should be minimized to
						prevent fragmentation of frames.
						Therefore, 6LoWPAN routing should not cause packets to exceed the
						IEEE 802.15.4 frame size.  This reduces the energy required for
						transmission, avoids unnecessary waste of bandwidth, and prevents
						the need for packet reassembly.  As calculated in RFC4944
						<xref target="RFC4944"/>, the maximum size of a 6LoWPAN frame,
						in order not to cause fragmentation, is 81 octets.

						Requirements on successful end-to-end packet delivery ratio

						is required <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-indus-routing-reqs"/>. In building automation applications,
						application layer errors must be below 0.01% <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs"/>.
					</t>
					<t>
						Successful end-to-end delivery of packets in an IEEE 802.15.4 mesh
						depends on the quality of the path selected by the routing protocol and
						on the ability of the routing protocol to cope with short-term and long-term quality variation.
						The metric of the routing protocol strongly influences performance of
						the routing protocol in terms of delivery ratio.
					</t>
					<t>
						The quality of a given path depends on the individual qualities of the links
						(including the devices) that compose that path. IEEE 802.15.4 settings affect
						the quality perceived at upper layers. In particular, in IEEE 802.15.4 reliable mode,
						if an acknowledgment frame is not received after a given period,
						the originator retries frame transmission up to a maximum number of times.
						If an acknowledgment frame is still not received by the sender
						after performing the maximum number of transmission attempts,
						the MAC layer assumes the transmission has failed and notifies the next
						higher layer of the failure. Note that excessive retransmission may be detrimental,

						Latency requirements may differ from a few hundreds milliseconds to minutes,

						forced entry security alerts must be routed to one or more fixed or mobile user devices
						within 5 s <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs"/>.
						Non-critical closed loop applications for industrial automation
						have latency requirements that can be as low as 100 ms but many control loops are
						tolerant of latencies above 1 s <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-indus-routing-reqs"/>. In contrast to this,

						In harsh environments, LoWPANs easily suffer from
						link failure. Collision or link failure easily increases send
						and receive queues and can lead to queue overflow and
						packet losses.

						6LoWPANs often have point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-point

				<t> <!-- R14: security-->
				    [R14] 6LoWPAN protocols SHOULD support secure delivery of control messages.

					provided by IEEE 802.15.4.
				</t>
				<t>
				<list>
					<t>
						Security threats within LoWPANs may be different from existing
						threat models in ad-hoc network environments.  Neighbor Discovery
						in IEEE 802.15.4 links may be susceptible to threats as listed in
						RFC3756 <xref target="RFC3756"/>.  Bootstrapping may also impose additional threats.
						Security is also very important for designing robust routing
						protocols, but it should not cause significant transmission
						overhead. While there are applications which require very high security,
						such as in traffic control, other applications are less easily harmed by
						wrong node behavior, such as a home entertainment system.
					</t>
					<t>
						The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC provides an AES-based security mechanism. Routing
						protocols need to define how this mechanism can be used to obtain
						the intended security, either for the routing protocol alone or
						in conjunction with the security used for the data. Byte overhead of the mechanism, which depends
						on the security services selected, must be considered. In the worst
						case in terms of overhead, the mechanism consumes 21 bytes of MAC
						payload.
					</t>
					<t> <!-- This is inserted to resolve Issue Tracker #4. Suggested by Carles, Feb. 18.2009 -->
						IEEE 802.15.4 does not specify protection for acknowledgement frames.
						Since the sequence numbers of data frames are sent in the clear,
						an adversary can forge an acknowledgement for each data frame.
						This weakness can be combined with targeted jamming to prevent delivery of
						selected packets. In consequence, IEEE 802.15.4 acknowledgements cannot be relied upon.
						In applications that require high security, the routing protocol must not exploit
						feedback from acknowledgements (e.g. to keep track of neighbor connectivity, see [R16]).

		<section title="Security Considerations">
			<t>
				Security issues are described in Section 4.4. The security considerations
				of RFC 4919 <xref target="RFC4919"/> and RFC 4944 <xref target="RFC4944"/> apply as well.
			</t>
			<t>
				The use of wireless links renders a 6LoWPAN susceptible to attacks
				like any other wireless network.
				In outdoor 6LoWPANs, the physical exposure of the nodes
				allows an adversary to capture, clone or tamper with these devices.
				In ad-hoc 6LoWPANs that are dynamic in both their topology and node memberships,
				a static security configuration does not suffice.
				Spoofed, altered, or replayed routing information might occur while
				multihopping could delay the detection and treatment of attacks.
			</t>
			<t>
				This specification expects that the link layer is sufficiently protected,
				either by means of physical or IP security for the backbone link or with
				MAC sublayer cryptography.
				However, link-layer encryption and authentication may not be sufficient
				to provide data confidentiality, data authentication, data integrity, and data freshness.
				Time synchronization, self-organization and secure localization
				for multi-hop routing are also critical to support.
			</t>
			<t>
				For secure multi-hop routing it may be necessary to consider authenticated
				broadcast (and multicast) and bidirectional link verification.
				Multi-path routing could be considered for increasing security
				to prevent selective forwarding.
				However, the challenge is that 6LoWPANs already have high resource constraints,
				so that ER and LoWPAN nodes may require different security solutions.
