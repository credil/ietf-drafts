                 Optimized RIP for embedded RF networks
                   draft-mulligan-roll-ripless-00.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies an optimization to the Routing Information
   Protocol (RIP) routing protocol for use in embedded RF IPv6 internets
   such as those used in 6lowpan [7] networks.  RIPless specifies the
   minimal changes to RIP, as specified in RIPng [2], RIP [3] and RIPv2
   [4] to allow the protocol to be used in a lossy RF network where the
   routing fabric of the network is built upon powered nodes and that
   only the edge devices may be battery powered.

Internet-Draft          RIPless Routing Protocol              March 2010


1.  Introduction

   RIPless is an optimization to the Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
   as specified in RIPng [2], RIP [3] and RIPv2 [4] to allow the
   protocol to be used in a lossy RF network.

   The RF network envisioned to use RIPless is different from the
   network planned for the RPL protocol [10].  Where RPL was designed to
   take into account and deal with battery operated routers RIPless
   assumes that the "routers" inside the RF network have plenty of
   power, but that as with all low-output-power RF networks, the "link"
   is lossy and devices that at one moment are on-link the next moment
   may not.  Because the routing fabric of the RF network is not power
   resource limited and is expected not to be bandwidth limited, it is
   alright to send periodic routing update information - even occasional
   flooding is not prohibitive.

   In addition, the goals of RIPless are to provide a good mechanism for
   forwarding packets from the Internet into the 6LowPAN network and to
   the end nodes and to provide a good ability to transmit packets point
   to point (P2P) within the 6LowPAN.  This is in addition to ability to
   send data from 6LowPAN nodes to Internet devices and servers (MP2P).

   It is also envisioned that through the use of network prefixes
   RIPless will allow route aggregation witin the 6LowPAN network
   thereby reducing routing table entries to just include 6LowPAN
   routers and not Hosts connected by those routers.

   Since RIP is one of the most widely depolyed and well understood
   routing protocols the goal was to change as little as possible in the
   fundementals of RIP, but to make only those optimizations necessary
   to allow RIP to operate in these resource constrained (memory and
   output power) devices.

   This document does not describe the theory of RIP or Distance Vector
   protocols.  For background and understanding of RIP, read RFC1058 [3]
   and RFC2080 [2].  It is important to understand that generally the
   devices that ran RIP had multiple interfaces and that RIP was used to
   route between those interface.  In the case of RIPless, the devices
   on a 6LowPAN network have only a single interface (except for the
   6LowPAN Edge Router) and that RIPless is used to forward routing
   information over a single interface, but between routing nodes.

   Because the focus for this development is 6lowpan [7] type networks,
   the basis of RIPless is the RIPng [2] since it updates RIP for use
   with IPv6 addresses.

Internet-Draft          RIPless Routing Protocol              March 2010


1.1.  Routing Plane vs. Forwarding Plane

   Like RIP, RPL, OSPF, IS-IS and most other routing protocols, this
   document does not attempt to change the separation of the "Routing
   Plane" from the "Forwarding Plane".  Separation of routing plane and
   forwarding plane came from the fact the changes in routing topology
   tended to be very infrequent compared to the frequency of packets
   being forwarded.  The number of packets transmitted is very large
   compared to number of changes in routing therefore it was important
   to try to make packet forwarding very fast and efficient compared to
   detecting changes in routing topology.  In RF this may be different
   as the time scale for changes in routing is much smaller (especially
   over a large mesh network) when compared to the number of packets
   being transmitted.

   Combining the Routing plane and forwarding plane, while out of scope
   for this document, might provide a more efficient and robust
   mechanism for moving packets through RF connected links.

1.2.  RIP Optimizations

   As stated the goal of this document is to change only those things
   that are necessary to allow RIP to be used in this RF lossy
   environment, but to leave the basic operating fundementals unchanged.
   To that end only the following are the optimizations:

   o  Routing Metric
   o  Count to Infinity
   o  RIP message timing
   o  Require Split Horizon
   o  Compressed addresses
   o  RIP message format


2.  Definition Of Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   6LowPan-link:
      It is a wireless link determined by single hop reachability of
      neighboring nodes.
   6LowPan-router(6LR):
      These are the intermediate routers in the 6LowPan network who can
      communicate with other 6LowPan-routers in the same 6LowPan
      network.  These are also the immediate first-hop router for
      6LowPan host nodes. 6LowPan routers are present only in "route-

      over" topologies.
   6LowPAN Edge Router(6LER):
      It is a 6LowPan-router located at the junction of 6LowPan networks
      or between a 6LowPan network and a legacy IP network.  There may
      be one or more 6LER. network.
   Host node:
      A host node in 6LowPan network is considered a IPv6 node without
      routing and forwarding capability.
   Mesh-under:
      A network configuration topology where 6LowPan host nodes are
      connected to the 6LowPAN Edge Router through a the use of Layer-2
      forwarding.  In a "mesh-under" configuration all IPv6 host nodes
      in a 6LowPan network are only one IP hop away from any other
      6LowPAN host, 6LER within the 6LowPAN network.  This topology
      simulates the typical IP-subnet topology with one router with
      multiple nodes in the same subnet.
   Route-over:
      This is a configuration where 6LowPan host nodes are connected to
      the 6LER through a set of intermediate Layer-3 routers (6LR).
      Here host nodes are typically multiple hops away from the 6LER.
      The Route-over topology typically consists of a IPv6 edge router,
      a set of nodes capable of IP routing and possibly some host nodes.


3.  Assumptions

   o  6LowPan nodes will use EUI-64 style Interface-id in their IPv6
      address.  Optionally for 16-bit IEEE 802.15.4 short addresses,
      DHCP addresses are recommended to ensure address uniqueness.
   o  All routers (6LRs and 6LERs) are powered and do not sleep, ie.
      they are "always on".  As a result periodic routing update
      messages are not prohibitive.
   o  6LowPAN networks will be relavtively limited in size and depth.
      It is not expected that within any single 6lowpan there will be
      more than 50 routing nodes, though there could very likely be 10
      to 20 host nodes "attached" to each routing node.
   o  6LRs are highly memory and processing constrained and as such
      cannot store very large routing tables.
   o  A 6LER is capable of routing/forwarding packets between a 6LowPan
      network and a backbone network.  The 6LER is responsible for
      assigning a /64 IPv6 prefix to the 6LowPan network.  It advertises
      one or more IPv6 prefixes to the 6LowPAN network.
   o  The 6LRs that are in range of 6LER use the /64 prefix advertised
      by the 6LER.  The 6LRs store this prefix and use them for forming
      its own global autoconfigured addresses. 6LRs may use DHCP for
      short address assignment.  When sending Router Advertisements,
      6LowPan-routers use the same prefix(es).  A 6LR SHOULD relay any
      prefix related options received from its parent router during

      Neighbor Discovery procedure.
   o  The 6LowPan host nodes either autoconfigure IPv6 address based on
      the prefix received in the Router Advertisement, or it uses DHCP
      for short address assignment.  It can receive multiple Router
      Advertisements and should configure at least one default router as
      its immediate nexthop.  It may configure multiple default routers,
      but this is implementation specific.  The 6LowPan host nodes
      always send their packets to the default router.  If one default
      router becomes unavailable, it chooses the next available default
      router or it may restart the ND process.


4.  Applicability Statement

   This document aims to guide implementors in choosing an appropriate
   routing protocol for a 6LowPan network that conforms to the previous
   assumptions.  In particular, sensor and Smart Grid networks where the
   routing fabric of the network will be "always-on" and where only the
   host nodes may sleep.  In addtion, this protocol would be usable
   highly constrained devices with limited RAM or processing power, so
   long as the total number of routing nodes in the 6LowPAN is limited
   to approimately 50.  The total number of nodes within the 6LowPAN
   could be greater than 500.


5.  RIPless Operation

   The enviroment for a 6LowPAN network to use RIPless is one where the
   6LRs are "always-on".  They may be line-powered or powered by very
   large batteries or some form of energy harvesting, but they do not
   sleep.  Clustered around each of the 6LRs are a number of 6LowPAN
   hosts (o in the figure below).  These host nodes may be always-on or
   may sleep, but they expect that the routing fabric will be available
   when they need to send data.  This is not to say that they expect
   that the particular 6LR that they "spoke" with prviously (their
   "default router") will be available, but that some 6LR will respond
   to RS/RA messages should the default router not be available.

   In addtion to the 6LRs, there will be at least one 6LER in the
   network that attaches the 6LowPAN network to "Legacy" or wired world.

            ===========
              Legacy


   It is important to understand that the RIP routing information used
   within the 6LowPAN network will not be used or "leaked" past the
   6LER.  Just because RIP is being used inside the 6LowPAN network does
   not mean that the routing nodes inside the network exchange or
   participate in any RIP routing outside the 6LowPAN network - the
   6LowPAN network is a distinct and separate sub-network.

5.1.  6LR and 6LER operation

   It is expected that the 6LER will run some routing protocol to both
   advertise the 6LowPAN network and to participating in routing over
   the Legacy network.  The 6LR will likely advertise a "default route"
   to the 6LowPAN network.  Each node within the 6LowPAN network will
   use some form of Neighbor Discovery to learn the 6LRs or 6LERs around
   it.  The 6LRs will run the RIPless protocol to echange routing
   information with other neighbor 6LRs or the 6LER.

5.2.  6LowPAN Host operation

   The 6LowPAN hosts will also use a Neighbor Discovery mechanism to
   learn of the 6LRs or 6LERs nearby.  The will simply configure the
   learned router as their default router.  If that router is not
   available when the host needs to send data, it will learn of a new
   default router through another RS/RA exchange or if so configured
   will use an alternative default router.


6.  RIP Optimizations

   This sections decribes the modifications and optimizations to the
   basic RIP routing protocol.

6.1.  Routing Metric

   The routing metric described in the RIP RFCs is a simple hop-count.
   It is thought in the RF sensor networking community (???need
   reference???) that just a simple hop count is insufficient to



Mulligan                Expires September 2, 2010               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          RIPless Routing Protocol              March 2010


   properly determine the "best path" between two nodes.  It is suggest
   here that a weighted hop-count might provide a better metric.  The
   hop-count would be weighted by the RSSI/LQI value for the link
   between each node.  The specific weighting could be implementation
   specific, but for an IEEE 802.15.4 [9] type network using 8 discrete
   LQI values links with an LQI of 0x00 and 0x01 might have the metric
   set to "infinite", LQIs of 0x02 through 0x05 would set metric to 2
   and an LQI of 0x06 or 0x07 would use the standard metric value of 1.
   If the implementor would rather use RSSI values or more values in LQI
   (256) are available some different step funtion might be use.

6.2.  Count to Infinity

   The current value for Infinity in RIP is 15.  For these small 6LowPAN
   networks the value 15 is probably too large.  This large value means
   that it takes more time for routes to converge when route disappears.
   Therefore rather than using the standard value of 15 for infinite a
   smaller value of 6 MUST be used.

6.3.  RIP message timing

   The standard timing for RIP update messages is 30 seconds.  This
   appears to be much to slow for usefulness in the 6LowPAN environment.
   It is expected that the RF connectivity between nodes will change
   more frequently and as a result the timing for RIP messages SHOULD be
   reduced to 15 seconds.  Since it is assumed that the routing nodes
   are powered this will not impact battery lifetime as there is no
   battery.

6.4.  Requiring Split Horizon

   This section is still TBD

6.5.  Compresses Addresses

   Since IPv6 addresses are very large and since the frame size of IEEE
   802.15.4 is very small, rather than sending full IPv6 addresses the
   IPv6 network prefix MUST be elided and only the EUI 64 or the short
   address will be sent.

6.6.  Modification to RIP message format

   The standard RIPng message format is:

   The "w" bit is set if the information about who the route was
   recieved from is present.

   The "S" bit is set if the IP IID is a short addresses.

   The "s" bit is set if the who address is a short addresses.

   The "mtrc" is the metric field.

   The Prefix len to specify that the IP address is a subnet prefix
   rather than an IID.  This would allow for route aggregation for all
   6LowPAN hosts "attached" to a specific router and thereby reducing
   the number of routing table entries required as opposed to a
   completely flat routing topology.

   As mentioned rather than full IPv6 addresses being sent the Network
   Prefix would be elided and only the EUI 64 IID or the short address
   would be sent.  Rather than sending the Prefix length the field will
   be used differently.  The S bit is set to indicate that a short
   address is being used.  It was suggested in RIPng [2] that the RIP
   message format be updated to include information about who the route
   was heard from for each route in the RIP message.  The purpose of
   this is reduce the convergence time.  Since message latency can be an
   important factor in 6LowPAN networks reducing the time to determine
   the proper route can be critical.  Therefore in RIPless each RIP
   packet may include who the route was heard from.


7.  Security Considerations

   These optimizations are not known to introduce any new threats
   against RIP beyond what is already documented for RIP[RFC 2080].  The
   6lowpan security analysis [12] discusses possible threats.


8.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations for this document.


9.  Acknowledgements

   The ideas behind this came from discussion with a number of people
   including Matt Gillmore, Pat Kinney, Eric Gnoske, Colin O'Flynn and
   folks working on 6LowPAN and ROLL WGs.
