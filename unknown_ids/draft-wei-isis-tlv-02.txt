       New TLV for Purge Packet in Intermediate System to Intermediate

                         draft-wei-isis-tlv-02.txt 


Abstract 

   At present the purge packet does not contain information of the 
   source Intermediate System (IS) generating it.  Thus under the 
   circumstance of purge packet propagation, it is difficult to 
   traceback and locate the source IS. 

   To address the problem, this document proposes to add a new TLV in 
   purge packet to record the system ID of the IS generating it.  This 
   TLV should not be changed in purge packets sent by other ISs.

1. Introduction 

   IS-IS [ISO 10589] routing protocol has been widely used in large-
   scale IP networks because of its strong scalability and fast speed of 
   convergence. IS-IS is a kind of link-state routing protocol by 
   flooding the Link State Protocol Data Unit (LSP) to advertise route 
   network widely. 

   The IS-IS protocol floods purges throughout an area, regardless of 
   which IS initiated the purge.  If a network operator would like to   
   investigate the cause of the purge, it is difficult to determine the 
   origin of the purge.  At present IS-IS protocol has no mechanism to 
   traceback and locate the source when purge packet propagation does 
   occur in the network.  To address this problem, this document 
   proposes to add a new TLV in purge packet to record the system ID of 
   the IS generating it.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft    New TLV for Purge Packet in IS-IS         March 2010 
    

3. Cases to Generate Purge Packet 

   The legitimate purge cases: 

   (1) Originating IS purges its own LSP. 

   (2) LSP owned by another IS ages out. 

   (3) A new DIS is elected. 

   The inappropriate purge cases: 

   (1) An implementation misunderstanding [ISO 10589] generates purge 
   packet when it receives corrupted LSP. 

   (2) An implementation with bugs tries to self-purge and makes some 
   truly egregious mistakes. 

   (3) An implementation fails to retain the LSP header after purging 
   while flooding is still in progress. 

4. Proposed New TLV in Purge Packet  

   This document proposes a new TLV for purge packet, which records the 
   system ID of the IS generating the purge packet. This kind of TLV 
   SHOULD not be changed in purge packets sent by other ISs than the 
   initiator. 

   The purpose to introduce this TLV is to traceback and locate the 
   source IS that initiates the purge packet when purge packet 
   propagation occurs in the network, which is usually caused by the 
   inappropriate cases mentioned in above section of this document. This 
   method is useful in both lab and field network. It is helpful for 
   both developers and network operators. 

   The new TLV is: 

   CODE - XX (to be assigned) 

   LENGTH - total length of the value field. 

   VALUE - System ID of the Intermediate System that initiates the Purge 
   packet.

5. Security Considerations 

   If the proposed TLV is used in conjunction with IS-IS authentication 
   mechanisms [RFC5304][RFC5310], the purge LSP is constructed by 
   removing the original contents of the LSP, leaving only the LSP 
   header, adding the proposed TLV and then adding the IS-IS 
   authentication TLV.  This document amends the behavior specified in 
   [RFC5304] and [RFC5310]. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   A new code is solicited to be assigned to the proposed TLV.
