Abstract

   This document describes a pseudowire that is used to transport a
   packet service over an MPLS PSN is the case where the client LSR and
   the server PE are co-resident in the same equipment.  For correct
   operation these clients require a multi-protocol interface with fate
   sharing between the client protocol suite.  The packet pseudowire may
   be used to carry all of the required layer 2 and layer 3 protocols
   between the pair of client LSRs.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   There is a need to provide a method of carrying a packet service over
   an MPLS PSN in a way that provides isolation between the two
   networks.  The server MPLS network may be a "classic" MPLS network or
   an MPLS-TP network [RFC5317].  The client may also be either a
   "classic" MPLS network of an MPLS-TP network.  Considerations as to
   whether an MPLS "classic" network can act as a server for an MPLS-TP
   network are outside the scope of this document.

   Where the client equipment is connected to the server equipment via
   physical interface, the same data-link type MUST be to attach the
   clients to the PEs, and a pseudowire of the same type as the data-
   link MUST be used [RFC3985].  The reason that inter-working between
   different physical and data-link attachment types is specifically
   disallowed in the pseudowire architecture is because this is a
   complex task and not a simple bit-mapping exercise.  The inter-
   working is not limited to the physical and data-link interfaces and
   state-machines it also requires a compatible approach to the
   formation of the adjacencies between attached client network
   equipment.  As an example the reader should consider the differences
   between router adjacency formation on a point to point link compared
   to a multi-point to multi-point interface (e.g.  Ethernet).

   A further consideration is that two adjacent MPLS LSRs do not simply
   exchange MPLS packets.  They exchange IP packets for adjacency
   formation, control, routing, label exchange, management and
   monitoring purposes.  In addition they may exchange data-link packets
   as part of routing (e.g.  IS-IS hellos and IS-IS LSPs) and for OAM
   purposes (e.g.  Cisco Discovery Protocol).  Thus the two clients
   require an attachment mechanism that can be used to multiplex a
   number of protocols.  In addition it is essential to the correct
   operation of the network layer that all of these protocols fate
   share.

   Where the client LSRs and server PEs are co-located in the same
   equipment the data-link layer can be simplified to a simple protocol
   identifier (PID) that is used to multiplex the various data-link
   types onto a pseudowire.  This is the method that described in this
   document.


2.  Network Reference Model

   The network reference model for the packet pseudowire is shown in
   Figure 1.  This is an extension of Figure 3 "Pre-processing within
   the PWE3 Network Reference Model" from [RFC3985].

   MPLS Pseudowire Network Reference Model

                                 Figure 1

   In this model LSRs, LSR1 and LSR2, are part of the client MPLS packet
   switched network (PSN).  The PEs, PE1 and PE2 are part of the server
   PSN, that is to be used to provide connectivity between the client
   LSRs.  The attachment circuit that is used to connect the MPLS LSRs
   to the PEs is a virtual interface within the equipment.  A packet
   pseudowire is used to provide connectivity between these virtual
   interfaces.  This packet pseudowire is used to transport all of the
   required layer 2 and layer 3 between protocols between LSR1 and LSR2.


3.  Packet Pseudowire Control Word

   This section describes the encapsulation of a packet pseudowire.  The
   packet pseudowire always uses the control word.  The control word
   consists of two components: the preferred pseudowire MPLS control
   word [RFC4385], immediately followed by a PPP data link layer (DLL)
   protocol number [RFC1661].  The 16 bit format of the PPP DLL protocol
   number MUST be used.

   The MPLS pseudowire control word is shown in Figure 2.  Definitions

   Note that the PPP link control protocol is not used.


4.  Status Indication

   A pseudowire status indicating a fault can be considered equivalent
   to interface down and SHOULD be passed across the virtual interface
   to the loacl LSR.  This improves scaling in PE with large numbers of
   c-resident LSRs and with LSRs that have large numbers of interfaces
   mapped to pseudowires.

   The mechanism described for the mapping of pseudowire status to the
   virtual interface state that are described in [RFC4447] and in
   section 10 of [I-D.ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw] apply to the packet
   pseudowire.  Pseudowire status messages indicating pseudowire or
   remote virtual interface faults MUST be mapped to a fault indication
   on the local virtual interface.


5.  Congestion Considerations

   This pseudowire is being used to carry MPLS and its associated
   support protocols over an MPLS network.  There are no congestion
   considerations beyond those that ordinarily apply to an MPLS network.


6.  Security Considerations

   The packet pseudowire provides no means of protecting the contents or
   delivery of the pseudowire packets on behalf of the client packet

   service.  The packet pseudowire may, however, leverage security
   mechanisms provided by the MPLS Tunnel Layer.  A more detailed
   discussion of pseudowire security is given in [RFC3985], [RFC4447]
   and [RFC3916].


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA are requested to allocate a new pseudowire type for packet
   pseudowire in the MPLS Pseudowire Types Registry.  The next available
   value is requested.
