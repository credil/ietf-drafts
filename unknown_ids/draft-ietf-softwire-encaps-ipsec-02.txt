1. Introduction

   The BGP [RFC4271] Encapsulation Subsequence Address Family
   Identifiers (SAFI) allows for the communication of tunnel information
   and the association of this information to a BGP next hop.  The
   Encapsulation SAFI can be used to support the mapping of prefixes to
   next hops and tunnels of the same address family, IPv6 prefixes to
   IPv4 next hops and tunnels using [RFC4798], and IPv4 prefixes to IPv6
   next hops and tunnels using [V4NLRI-V6NH].  The Encapsulation SAFI
   can also be used to support the mapping of VPN prefixes to tunnels
   when VPN prefixes are advertised per [RFC4364] or [RFC4659].
   [SOFTWIRES] provides useful context for the use of the Encapsulation
   SAFI.

   The Encapsulation SAFI is defined in [ENCAPS-SAFI].  [ENCAPS-SAFI]
   also defines support for the GRE [RFC2784], L2TPv3 [RFC3931] and IP
   in IP [RFC2003] tunnel types.  This document builds on [ENCAPS-SAFI]
   and defines support for IPsec tunnels.  Support is defined for IP
   Authentication Header in Tunnel-mode (AH), [RFC4302], and for IP
   Encapsulating Security Payload in Tunnel-mode (ESP), [RFC4303]. The
   IPsec architecture is defined in [RFC4301].  Support for IP in IP,
   [RFC2003], and MPLS-in-IP, [RFC4023] protected by IPsec Transport
   Mode is also defined.

   The Encapsulation NLRI Format is not modified by this document.


1.1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. IPsec Tunnel Encapsulation Types

   Per [ENCAPS-SAFI], tunnel type is indicated in the Tunnel
   Encapsulation attribute. This document defines the following tunnel
   type values:

     - Reserved = 3

     - IPsec in Tunnel-mode: Tunnel Type = 4 [RFC4302], [RFC4303]

     - IP in IP Tunnel with IPsec Transport Mode: Tunnel Type = 5
       [RFC2003], [RFC4303]

     - MPLS-in-IP Tunnel with IPsec Transport Mode: Tunnel Type = 6
       [RFC4023]

     Note, see Section 4.3 of [ENCAPS-SAFI] for a discussion on the

     advertisement and use of multiple tunnel types.

     Note, the specification in [RFC4023] for MPLS-in-IP tunnels with
     IPsec Transport mode applies as well to IP in IP tunnels.

   This document does not specify the use of the sub-TLV types defined
   in [ENCAPS-SAFI] with these tunnel types.  See below for the
   definition of an IPsec tunnel type specific sub-TLV.


3. Use of IPsec

   If a R1 is a BGP speaker that receives an Encapsulation SAFI update
   from another BGP speaker, R2, then if R1 has any data packets for
   which R2 is the BGP next hop, R1 MUST initiate an IPsec SA of the
   specified "tunnel type", and all such data packets MUST be sent
   through that SA.

   Let R1 and R2 be two BGP speakers that may send data packets through
   R3, such that the data packets from R1 and from R2 may be received by
   R3 over the same interface.  In this case, when R3 sends an
   Encapsulation SAFI which indicates an IPsec tunnel type to R2, then
   R3 SHOULD also send an update specifying an Encapsulation SAFI with
   an IPsec tunnel type to R1.  That is, on a given interface, if IPsec
   is required for any data packets, it SHOULD be required for all.
   This eliminates dependence on the IPsec selector mechanisms to
   correctly distinguish traffic which needs to be protected from
   traffic which does not.

   Security policy has the granularity of BGP speaker to BGP speaker.
   The required security policies must be configured into the BGP
   speakers.  Policies for each SA will typically be established using
   IKEv2, [RFC4306], with either public-key or pre-shared key
   authentication.  The SA MAY also be configured via manual techniques.
   Manual configuration specification and considerations are defined in
   [RFC4301], [RFC4302] and [RFC4303] (and includes keys, SPI numbers,
   IPsec protocol, integrity/encryption algorithms, and sequence number
   mode).


4. IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV

   This document defines a new sub-TLV for use with the Tunnel
   Encapsulation Attribute defined in [ENCAPS-SAFI].  The new sub-TLV is
   referred to as the "IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV", and one or
   more of the sub-TLVs MAY be included in any Encapsulation SAFI NLRI
   ([ENCAPS-SAFI]) indicating a Tunnel Type defined in this document.
   Support for the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV MUST be
   implemented whenever the tunnel types defined in this document are
   implemented.  However, its use is OPTIONAL, and is a matter of
   policy.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-softwire-encaps-ipsec-02.txt   March 23, 2009


   The sub-TLV type of the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV is 3.  The
   sub-TLV length is variable.  The structure of the sub-TLV is as
   follows:

     - Authenticator Type: two octets

       This document defines authenticator type 1, "SHA-1 hash of public
       key", as defined in section 3.7 of RFC 4306.

     - Value: (variable)

       A value used to authenticate the BGP speaker that generated this
       NLRI.  The length of this field is is not encoded explicitly, but
       can be calculated as (sub-TLV length - 2).

       In the case of authenticator type 1, this field contains the
       20-octet value of the hash.

   A BGP speaker which sends the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV with
   authenticator type 1 MUST be configured with a private key, public
   key pair, the public key being the key whose hash is sent in the
   value field of the sub-TLV.  The BGP speaker MUST either (a) be able
   to generate a self-signed certificate for the public key, or else (b)
   be configured with a certificate for the public key.

   When the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV is used, it is highly
   RECOMMENDED that the integrity of the BGP session itself be
   protected.  This is usually done by using the TCP MD5 option
   [RFC2385].



4.1. Use of the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV

   If a IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV with authenticator type 1 is
   present in the Encapsulation SAFI update, then R1 (as defined above
   in Section 3) must use IKEv2 [RFC4306] to obtain a certificate from
   R2 (as defined above in Section 3), and R2 must send a certificate
   for the public key whose hash occurred in the value field of the
   IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-TLV.  R1 MUST NOT attempt to establish
   an SA to R2 UNLESS the public key in the certificate hashes to the
   same value that occurs in one of the IPsec Tunnel Authenticator sub-
   TLVs.

5. Security Considerations

   This document uses IP based tunnel technologies to support data plane
   transport.  Consequently, the security considerations of those tunnel
   technologies apply.  This document defines support for IPsec AH
   [RFC4302] and ESP [RFC4303].  The security considerations from those
   documents as well as [RFC4301] apply to the data plane aspects of
   this document.

   As with [ENCAPS-SAFI], any modification of the information that is
   used to form encapsulation headers, or to choose a tunnel type, or to
   choose a particular tunnel for a particular payload type, user data
   packets may end up getting misrouted, misdelivered, and/or dropped.
   Misdelivery is less of an issue when IPsec is used as such
   misdelivery is likely to result in a failure of authentication or
   decryption at the receiver.  Furthermore, in environments where
   authentication of BGP speakers is desired, the IPsec Tunnel
   Authenticator sub-TLV defined in Section 4 may be used.

   More broadly, the security considerations for the transport of IP
   reachability information using BGP are discussed in [RFC4271] and
   [RFC4272], and are equally applicable for the extensions described in
   this document.

   If the integrity of the BGP session is not itself protected, then an
   imposter could mount a denial of service attack by establishing
   numerous BGP sessions and forcing an IPsec SAs to be created for each
   one.  However, as such an imposter could wreak havoc on the entire
   routing system, this particular sort of attack is probably not of any
   special importance.

   It should be noted that a BGP session may itself be transported over
   an IPsec tunnel.  Such IPsec tunnels can provide additional security
   to a BGP session.  The managment of such IPsec tunnels is outside the
   scope of this document.


6. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to administer assignment of new namespaces and new
   values for namespaces defined in this document and reviewed in this
   section.

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the assignment in
   the "BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Tunnel Types" and the "BGP
   Tunnel  Encapsulation Attribute Sub-TLVs" registries.
