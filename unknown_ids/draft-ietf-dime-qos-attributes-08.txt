Abstract

   This document extends the IPFilterRule AVP functionality of the
   Diameter Base protocol and the functionality of the QoS-Filter-Rule
   AVP defined in RFC 4005.  The ability to convey Quality of Service
   information using the AVPs defined in this document is available to
   existing and future Diameter applications where permitted by the
   command ABNF.

Internet-Draft         QoS Attributes for Diameter          October 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a number of Diameter Quality of Service (QoS)
   related AVPs that can be used in existing and future Diameter
   applications where permitted by the command ABNF.  The Extended-QoS-
   Filter-Rule AVP thereby replaces the IPFilterRule, defined in RFC
   3588bis [I-D.ietf-dime-rfc3588bis], and the QoS-Filter-Rule, defined
   in RFC 4005 [RFC4005].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Diameter QoS Defined AVPs

3.1.  QoS-Capability AVP

   The QoS-Capability AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and contains
   a list of supported Quality of Service profile templates (and
   therefore the support of the respective parameter AVPs).

   The QoS-Capability AVP may be used for a simple announcement of the
   QoS capabilities and QoS profiles supported by a peer.  It may also
   be used to negotiate a mutually supported set of QoS capabilities and
   QoS profiles between two peers.


   QoS-Capability ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
                    * [ QoS-Profile-Template ]
                    * [ Vendor-Specific-QoS-Profile-Template ]
                    * [ AVP ]

3.2.  QoS-Profile-Template AVP

   The QoS-Profile-Template AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32 and
   contains a QoS profile template identifier.  An initial QoS profile
   template is defined with value of 0 and is described in
   [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-parameters].  The registry for the QoS profile
   templates is created with the same document.

3.3.  Vendor-Specific-QoS-Profile-Template AVP

   The Vendor-Specific-QoS-Profile-Template AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of
   type Grouped and defines a vendor-specific QoS profile template.

Internet-Draft         QoS Attributes for Diameter          October 2008


   The Vendor-Id AVP contains a 32 bit IANA SMI Network Management
   Private Enterprise Code and the QoS-Profile-Template AVP contains the
   template identifier assigned by the vendor.


   Vendor-Specific-QoS-Profile-Template ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
                                            { Vendor-Id }
                                            { QoS-Profile-Template }
                                          * [ AVP ]

3.4.  QoS-Resources AVP

   The QoS-Resources AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and includes
   a description of the Quality of Service resources for policing
   traffic flows.


   QoS-Resources ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
                   * [ Extended-QoS-Filter-Rule ]
                   * [ AVP ]

3.5.  Extended-QoS-Filter-Rule AVP

   The Extended-QoS-Filter-Rule AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped
   and defines one or more traffic flows together with a set of QoS
   parameters that should be applied to the flow(s) by the Resource
   Management Function.  This AVP uses the Classifier AVP (see
   Section 5) to describe traffic flows.


   Extended-QoS-Filter-Rule ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
                                { QoS-Semantics }
                                [ QoS-Profile-Template ]
                                [ Vendor-Specific-QoS-Profile-Template ]
                                [ QoS-Parameters ]
                                [ QoS-Rule-Precedence ]
                                [ Classifier ]
                              * [ Time-Of-Day-Condition ]
                              * [ AVP ]

   Either the QoS-Profile-Template or Vendor-Specific-QoS-Profile-
   Template AVP MUST appear in the Extended-QoS-Filter-Rule AVP.

3.6.  QoS-Semantics

   The QoS-Semantics AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated and
   provides the semantics for the QoS-Profile-Template and QoS-
   Parameters AVPs in the Extended-QoS-Filter-Rule AVP.

Internet-Draft         QoS Attributes for Diameter          October 2008


   This document defines the following values:

    (0): QoS-Desired
    (1): QoS-Available
    (2): QoS-Reserved
    (3): Minimum-QoS
    (4): QoS-Authorized

3.7.  QoS-Parameters AVP

   The QoS-Parameters AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and
   contains Quality of Service parameters.  These parameters are defined
   in a separate document, see [I-D.ietf-dime-qos-parameters].

3.8.  QoS-Rule-Precedence AVP

   The QoS-Rule-Precedence AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32 and
   specifies the execution order of the rules expressed in the QoS-
   Resources AVP.  Rules with equal precedence MAY be executed in
   parallel if supported by the Resource Management Function.  If the
   QoS-Rule-Precedence AVP is absent from the Extended-QoS-Filter-Rule
   AVP, the rules SHOULD be executed in the order in which they appear
   in the QoS-Resources AVP.  The lower the numerical value of QoS-Rule-
   Precedence AVP, the higher the rule precedence.


4.  Semantics of QoS Parameters

   The QoS parameters carried in the QoS-Resources AVP may appear in
   different messages.  The semantic of the QoS parameters depend on the
   information provided in the QoS-Semantics AVP which currently defines
   5 values, namely QoS-Desired (0), QoS-Available (1), QoS-Reserved
   (2), Minimum-QoS (3), and QoS-Authorized (4).

   The semantics of the different values are as follows:

   QoS-Desired     C->S       Please authorize the indicated QoS
   QoS-Desired     C<-S       NA
   QoS-Available   C->S       Admission Control at interface indicates
                              that this QoS is available. (note 1)
   QoS-Available   C<-S       Indicated QoS is available. (note 2)

   QoS-Reserved    C<-S       NA
   Minimum-QoS     C->S       Indicates that the client is not
                              interested in authorizing QoS that is
                              lower than Min. QoS.
   Minimum-QoS     C<-S       The client must not provide QoS
                              guarantees lower than Min. QoS.
   QoS-Authorized  C->S       NA
   QoS-Authorized  C<-S       Indicated QoS authorized

   Legend:

         no semantic defined in this specification

   Notes:

    (1) QoS-Available is only useful in relationship with QoS-Desired

    (2) QoS-Available is only useful when the AAA server performs
        admission control and knows about the resources in the network.


5.  Diameter Classifier AVPs

   Classifiers are used in many applications to specify how to classify
   packets.  For example in a QoS application, if a packet matches a
   classifier then that packet will be treated in accordance with a QoS
   specification associated with that classifier.

   The Classifiers are sent to on on-path element (e.g. a router) which
   uses the classifier to match packets.  Figure 1 shows a typical
   deployment.

              Figure 1: Example of a Classifier Architecture

   The managed terminal, the terminal for which the classifiers are
   being specified is located on the left of the Classifying Entity.
   The unmanaged terminal, the terminal that receives packets from the
   Managed terminal or sends packets to the managed terminal is located
   to the right side of the Classifying Entity.

   The Classifying Entity is responsible for classifying packets that
   are incoming (IN) from the Managed Terminal or packets outgoing (OUT)
   to the Managed Terminal.

   A Classifier consists of a group of attributes that specify how to
   match a packet.  Each set of attributes expresses values about
   aspects of the packet - typically the packet header.  Different
   protocols therefore would use different attributes.

   In general a Classifier consists of the following:

   Identifier:

      The identifier uniquely identifies this classifier and may be used
      to reference the classifier from another structure.

   From:

      Specifies the rule for matching the source part of the packet.

   To:

      Specifies the rule for matching the destination part of the
      packet.

   Protocol:

      Specifies the matching protocol of the packet.

   Direction:

      Specifies whether the classifier is to apply to packets flowing
      from the Managed Terminal (IN) or to packets flowing to the
      Managed Terminal (OUT), or packets flowing in both direction.

   Options:

      Associated with each protocol or layer, or various values specific
      to the header of the protocol or layer.  Options allow matching on
      those values.


   Each protocol type will have a specific set of attributes that can be
   used to specify a classifier for that protocol.  These attributes
   will be grouped under a grouped AVP called a Classifier AVP.

5.1.  Classifier AVP

   The Classifier AVP (AVP Code TBD) is a grouped AVP that consists of a
   set of attributes that specify how to match a packet.


   Classifier ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
                  { Classifier-ID }

5.2.  Classifier-ID AVP

   The Classifier-ID AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and
   uniquely identifies the classifier.  Each application will define the
   uniqueness scope of this identifier, e.g. unique per terminal or
   globally unique.  Exactly one Classifier-ID AVP MUST be contained
   within a Classifier AVP.

5.3.  Protocol AVP

   The Protocol AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated and specifies
   the protocol being matched.  The attributes included in the
   Classifier AVP must be consistent with the value of the Protocol AVP.
   Exactly one Protocol AVP MUST be contained within a Classifier AVP.
   The values for this AVP are managed by IANA under the Protocol
   Numbers registry [PROTOCOL].

5.4.  Direction AVP

   The Direction AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated that specifies
   in which direction to apply the Classifier.  The values of the
   enumeration are: "IN","OUT","BOTH".  In the "IN" and "BOTH"
   directions, the From-Spec refers to the address of the Managed
   Terminal and the To-Spec refers to the unmanaged terminal.  In the
   "OUT" direction, the From-Spec refers to the Unmanaged Terminal
   whereas the To-Spec refers to the Managed Terminal.


     Value | Name and Semantic
     ------+--------------------------------------------------
       0   | RESERVED
       1   | IN - The classifier applies to flows from the
           | Managed Terminal.
       2   | OUT - The classifier applies to flows to the
           | Managed Terminal.
       3   | BOTH - The classifier applies to flows both to
           | and from the Managed Terminal.

5.5.  From-Spec AVP

   The From-Spec AVP (AVP Code TBD) is a grouped AVP that specifies the
   Source Specification used to match the packet.  Zero or more of these
   AVPs may appear in the Classifier.  If this AVP is absent from the
   Classifier then all packets are matched regardless of the source
   address.  If more than one instance of this AVP appears in the
   Classifier then the source of the packet can match any From-Spec AVP.
   The contents of this AVP are protocol specific.

   If more than one instance of the IP address AVPs (IP-Address, IP-
   Address-Range, IP-Address-Mask, Use-Assigned-Address) appear in the
   From-Spec AVP then the source IP address of the packet must match one
   of the addresses represented by these AVPs.

   If more that one instance of the layer 2 address AVPs (MAC-Address,
   MAC-Address-Mask, EUI64-Address, EUI64-Address-Mask) appears in the
   From-Spec then the the source layer 2 address of the packet must
   match one of the addresses represented in these AVPs.

   If more that one instance of the port AVPs (Port, Port-Range) appears
   in the From-Spec AVP then the source port number must match one of
   the port numbers represented in these AVPs.

   If the IP address, MAC address and port AVPs appear in the same From-
   Spec AVP then the source packet must match all the specifications,
   i.e. match the IP address AND MAC address AND port number.


   From-Spec ::= < AVP Header: XXX >

                 [ Use-Assigned-Address ]
               * [ AVP ]

5.6.  To-Spec AVP

   The To-Spec AVP (AVP Code TBD) is a grouped AVP that specifies the
   Destination Specification used to match the packet.  Zero or more of
   these AVPs may appear in the Classifier.  If this AVP is absent from
   the Classifier then all packets are matched regardless of the
   destination address.  If more than one instance of this AVP appears
   in the Classifier then the destination of the packet can match any
   To-Spec AVP.  The contents of this AVP are protocol specific.

   If more than one instance of the IP address AVPs (IP-Address, IP-
   Address-Range, IP-Address-Mask, Use-Assigned-Address) appear in the
   To-Spec AVP then the destination IP address of the packet must match
   one of the addresses represented by these AVPs.

   If more that one instance of the layer 2 address AVPs (MAC-Address,
   MAC-Address-Mask, EUI64-Address, EUI64-Address-Mask) appears in the
   To-Spec then the the destination layer 2 address of the packet must
   match one of the addresses represented in these AVPs.

   If more that one instance of the port AVPs (Port, Port-Range) appears
   in the To-Spec AVP then the destination port number must match one of
   the port numbers represented in these AVPs.

   If the IP address, MAC address and port AVPs appear in the same To-
   Spec AVP then the destination packet must match all the
   specifications, i.e. match the IP address AND MAC address AND port
   number.


   To-Spec ::= < AVP Header: XXX >
             * [ IP-Address ]
             * [ IP-Address-Range ]
             * [ IP-Address-Mask ]
             * [ MAC-Address ]
             * [ MAC-Address-Mask]
             * [ EUI64-Address ]

             * [ AVP ]

5.7.  Source and Destination AVPs

   For packet classification the contents of the From-Spec and To-Spec
   can contain the following AVPs.

   By combining several of these AVPs within a From-Spec or To-Spec AVP
   and using more than one From-Spec or To-Spec AVP in the Classifier
   AVP, one can express many different types of address pools.

5.7.1.  Negated AVP

   The Negated AVP (AVP Code TBD) of type Enumerated containing the
   values of True or False.  Exactly zero or one of these AVPs may
   appear in the From-Spec or To-Spec AVP.  When set to True the meaning
   of the match in the To-Spec and From-Spec are negated, causing all
   other addresses to be matched instead.

   When set to False, or when the AVP is not included in the From-Spec
   or To-Spec AVP then the meaning of the match is not inverted, causing

                      * [ AVP ]

   If the IP-Address-Start AVP is not included then the address range
   starts from the first valid IP address up to and including the
   specified IP-Address-End address.

   If the IP-Address-End AVP is not included then the address range
   starts at the address specified by the IP-Address-Start AVP and
   includes all the remaining valid IP addresses.

   For the IP-Address-Range AVP to be valid, the IP-Address-Start AVP
   MUST contain a value that is less than that of the IP-Address-End
   AVP.

   IEEE 802.1ad S-VID bits MUST be greater than or equal to the S-VID-
   Start AVP value and less than or equal to the S-VID-End AVP value for
   a successful match.  If the S-VID-Start and S-VID-End AVPs are
   omitted, then existence of IEEE802.1ad encapsulation or comparison of
   the IEEE 802.1ad S-VID bits is irrelevamt for this Classifier.  If
   the S-VID-Start and S-VID-End AVPs are specified, then Ethernet
   packets without IEEE 802.1ad encapsulation MUST NOT match this
   Classifier.

   When the C-VID-Start AVP is present but the C-VID-End AVP is absent,
   the C-VID-Start AVP value MUST equal the value of the IEEE 802.1ad
   C-VID bits specified in [IEEE802.1ad] or the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN-ID bits
   specified in [IEEE802.1Q] for a successful match.  When both C-VID-

6.  Time Of Day AVPs

   In many QoS applications, the QoS specification applied to the
   traffic flow is conditional upon the time of day when the flow was
   observed.  The following sections define AVPs that can be used to
   express one or more time windows which determine when a QoS
   specification is applicable to a traffic flow.

                             [ Timezone-Flag ]
                           * [ AVP ]

   If more than one instance of this AVP is present in the Extended-QoS-
   Filter-Rule AVP, the current time at QoS rule evaluation MUST be
   within at least one of the time windows specified in one of the Time-
   Of-Day-Condition AVPs.

   When the Time-Of-Day-Condition AVP and Classifier AVP are present in
   the same Extended-QoS-Filter-Rule AVP, both the time of day and
   packet classification conditions MUST match for the QoS specification
   to be applied.

   For example, a time window for 9am to 5pm (local time) from Monday to
   Friday would be expressed as:

   Time-Of-Day-Condition = {
       Time-Of-Day-Start = 32400;
       Time-Of-Day-End = 61200;
       Day-Of-Week-Mask =

   in seconds from midnight.  If this AVP is absent from the Time-Of-
   Day-Condition AVP, the time window ends one second before midnight.

6.4.  Day-Of-Week-Mask AVP

   The Day-Of-Week-Mask AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.  The
   value is a bitmask which specifies the day of the week for the time
   window to match.  This document specifies the following bits:

7.  Examples

   This section shows a number of signaling flows where QoS negotiation
   and authorization is part of the conventional NASREQ, EAP or Credit
   Control applications message exchanges.  The signalling flows for the
   Diameter QoS Application are described in
   [I-D.ietf-dime-diameter-qos].

7.1.  Diameter EAP with QoS Information

   Figure 2 shows a simple signaling flow where a NAS (Diameter Client)
   announces its QoS awareness and capabilities included into the DER
   message and as part of the access authentication procedure.  Upon
   completion of the EAP exchange, the Diameter Server provides a pre-
   provisioned QoS profile with the QoS-Semantics in the Extended-QoS-
   Filter-Rule AVP set to "QoS-Authorized", to the NAS in the final DEA
   message.

   indicated QoS or rejects the request and informs the NAS about the
   result.  In this scenario the NAS does not need to include the QoS-
   Capability AVP in the AAR message as the QoS-Resources AVP implicitly
   does the same and also the NAS is authorizing a specific QoS profile,
   not a pre-provisioned one.

          Figure 4: Example of an Authorization-Only Message Flow

7.4.  Diameter Server Initiated Re-authorization of QoS

   Figure 5 shows a message exchange for a Diameter server initiated QoS
   re-authorization procedure.  The Diameter server sends the NAS a RAR
   message requesting re-authorization for an existing session and the
   NAS acknowledges it with a RAA message.  The NAS is aware of its
   existing QoS profile and information for the ongoing session that the
   Diameter server requested for re-authorization.  Thus, the NAS must
   initiate re-authorization of the existing QoS profile.  The re-
   authorization procedure is the same as in Figure 4.

   In this case the User is charged as soon as the Service Element (CC
   client) receives the service request.  In this case the client uses
   the "QoS-Desired" QoS-Semantics parameter in the QoS-Resources AVP
   that it sends to the Accounitng server.  The server responds with a
   "QoS-Available" QoS-Semantics parameter in the QoS-Resources AVP

   IANA is also requested to allocate a registry for the QoS-Semantics.
   The following values are allocated by this specification.

               (0): QoS-Desired
               (1): QoS-Available
               (2): QoS-Reserved
               (3): Minimum-QoS
               (4): QoS-Authorized

   A specification is required to add a new value to the registry.  A
   standards track document is required to depreciate, delete, or modify
   existing values.


11.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the extension of Diameter for conveying
   Quality of Service information.  The security considerations of the
   Diameter protocol itself have been discussed in RFC 3588bis
   [I-D.ietf-dime-rfc3588bis].  Use of the AVPs defined in this document
   MUST take into consideration the security issues and requirements of
   the Diameter Base protocol.
