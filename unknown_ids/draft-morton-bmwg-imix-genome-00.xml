    <abstract>
      <t>Benchmarking Methodologies have always relied on test conditions with
      constant packet sizes, with the goal of understanding what network
      device capability has been tested. Constant packets sizes differ
      significantly from the conditions encountered in operational deployment,
      and so additional tests are sometimes conducted with a mixture of packet
      sizes, or "IMIX". The mixture of sizes a networking device will
      encounter is highly variable and depends on many factors. An IMIX suited
      for one networking device and deployment will not be appropriate for
      another. However, the mix of sizes may be known and the tester may be
      asked to augment the fixed size tests. To address this need, and the
      additional goal of repeatable test conditions, this draft proposes a way
      to specify the exact repeating sequence of packet sizes from the usual
      set of fixed sizes.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This memo defines a method to unambiguously specify the sequence of
      packet sizes used in a load test.</t>

      <t>Benchmarking Methodologies <xref target="RFC2544"></xref> have always
      relied on test conditions with constant packet sizes, with the goal of
      understanding what network device capability has been tested. Tests with
      the smallest size stress the header processing capacity, and tests with
      the largest size stress the overall bit processing capacity. Tests with
      sizes in-between may determine the transition between these two
      capacities.</t>

      <t>Constant packets sizes differ significantly from the conditions
      encountered in operational deployment, and so additional tests are
      sometimes conducted with a mixture of packet sizes. The set of sizes
      used is often called an Internet Mix, or "IMIX" <xref
      target="Spirent"></xref>, <xref target="IXIA"></xref>, <xref
      target="Agilent"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The mixture of sizes a networking device will encounter is highly
      variable and depends on many factors. An IMIX suited for one networking
      device and deployment will not be appropriate for another. However, the
      mix of sizes may be known and the tester may be asked to augment the
      fixed size tests.</t>

      <t>To address this need, and the additional goal of repeatable test
      conditions, this draft proposes a way to specify the exact repeating
      sequence of packet sizes from the usual set of fixed sizes: the IMIX
      Genome.</t>

      <section title="First Draft">
        <t>In this first draft, some section are very short or to-be-provided
        (TBP), and there are several questions identified for further
        discussion.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Scope and Goals">
      <t>This memo defines a method to unambiguously specify the sequence of
      packet sizes that have been used in a load test, assuming that a
      relevant mix of sizes is known to the tester and the length of the
      repeating sequence is not very long (&lt;30 packets).</t>

      <t>The IMIX Genome will allow an exact sequence of packet sizes to be
      communicated as a single-line name, resolving the current ambiguity with
      results that simply refer to "IMIX".</t>

      <t>While documentation of the exact sequence is ideal, the memo also
      covers the case where the sequence of sizes is very long or may be
      generated by a pseudo-random process.</t>

      <t>It is a colossal non-goal to standardize one or more versions of the
      IMIX. This topic has been discussed on many occasions on the
      bmwg-list<xref target="IMIXonList"></xref>. The goal is to enable
      customization with minimal constraints while fostering repeatable
      testing once the fixed size testing is complete.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Specification of the IMIX Genome">
      <t>The IMIX Genome is specified in the following format:</t>

      <t>IMIX - 123456...x</t>

      <t>where each number is replaced by the letter corresponding to the
      packet size of the packet at that position in the sequence. The
      following table gives the letter encoding for the <xref
      target="RFC2544"></xref> standard sizes (64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1280,
      and 1518 bytes).</t>

      <texttable>
        <preamble></preamble>

        <ttcol>Size, bytes</ttcol>

        <ttcol>Genome Code Letter</ttcol>

        <c>64</c>

        <c>a</c>

        <c>128</c>

        <c>b</c>

        <c>256</c>

        <c>c</c>

        <c>512</c>

        <c>d</c>

        <c>1024</c>

        <c>e</c>

        <c>1280</c>

        <c>f</c>

        <c>1518</c>

        <c>g</c>

        <c>MTU ??</c>

        <c>h</c>

        <postamble></postamble>
      </texttable>

      <t>For example: a five packet sequence with sizes 64,64,64,1280,1518
      would be designated:</t>

      <t>IMIX - aaafg</t>

      <t>While this approach allows some flexibility, there are also
      constraints.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Non-RFC2544 packet sizes would need to be approximated by those
          available in the table.</t>

          <t>The Genome for very long sequences can become undecipherable by
          humans.</t>

          <t>Whether h=MTU is useful/desirable is TBD.</t>

          <t>Whether more tabulated packet sizes would be useful is TBD.</t>
        </list>Some open issues with this format are:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Multiple Source-Destination Address Pairs: is the IMIX sequence
          applicable to each pair, across multiple pairs in sets, or across
          all pairs?</t>

          <t>Multiple Tester Ports:is the IMIX sequence applicable to each
          port, across multiple ports in sets, or across all ports?</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Reporting Long or Pseudo-Random Packet Sequences">
      <t>When the IMIX-Genome cannot be used (when the sheer length of the
      sequence would make the genome unmanageable) or when the sequence is
      designed to vary within some proportional constraints, a table is
      necessary.</t>

      <texttable>
        <preamble></preamble>

        <ttcol>IP Length</ttcol>

        <ttcol>Percentage of Total</ttcol>

        <ttcol>Other Length(s)</ttcol>

        <c>64</c>

        <c>23</c>

        <c>82</c>

        <c>128</c>

        <c>67</c>

        <c>146</c>

        <c>1000</c>

        <c>10</c>

        <c>1018</c>

        <postamble></postamble>
      </texttable>

      <t>Note that this approach also allows non-standard packet sizes, but
      trades the short genome specification and ability to specify the exact
      sequence for other flexibilities.</t>

      <t>&gt;&gt;&gt; Specification for psuedo-random size generation here?

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
      technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
      environment, with dedicated address space and the other constraints
      <xref target="RFC2544"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
      and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test traffic
      into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test management
      network.</t>

      <t>Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
      solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.</t>

      <t>Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for
      benchmarking purposes. Any implications for network security arising
      from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production
      networks.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This memo makes no requests of IANA, and hopes that IANA will leave
      it alone as well.</t>
