Internet-Draft      IPPM standard compliance testing           July 2009


1.  Introduction

   Draft bradner-metrictest [bradner-metrictest] states:

   The Internet Standards Process RFC2026 [RFC2026] requires that for a
   IETF specification to advance beyond the Proposed Standard level, at
   least two genetically unrelated implementations must be shown to
   interoperate correctly with all features and options.  There are two
   distinct reasons for this requirement.

   In the case of a protocol specification, the notion of
   "interoperability" is reasonably intuitive - the implementations must
   successfully "talk to each other", while exercising all features and
   options.

   In the case of a specification for a performance metric, network
   latency for example, exactly what constitutes "interoperation" is
   less obvious.  The IESG didn't yet decide how to judge "metric
   specification interoperability" in the context of the IETF Standards
   Process and this new draft suggests a methodology which (hopefully)
   is suitable for IPPM metrics.  General applicability of the methods
   proposed in the following should however not be excluded.

   A metric specification describes a method of testing and a way to
   report the results of this testing.  One example of such a metric
   would be a way to test and report the latency that data packets would
   incur while being sent from one network location to another.

   Since implementations of testing metrics are by their nature stand-
   alone and do not interact with each other, the level of the
   interoperability called for in the IETF standards process cannot be
   simply determined by seeing that the implementations interact
   properly.  Instead, verifying equivalence by proofing that different
   implementations verifiably give statistically equivalent results
   Verifiable equivalence may take the place of interoperability.

   This document defines the process of verifying equivalence by using a
   specified test set up to create the required separate data sets
   (which may be seen as samples taken from the same underlying
   distribution) and then apply state of the art statistical methods to
   verify equivalence of the results.  To illustrate application of the
   process defined her, validating compliance with RFC2679 [RFC2679] is
   picked as an example.  While test set ups may vary with the metrics
   to be validated, the statistical methods will not.  Documents
   defining test setups to validate other metrics should be created by
   the IPPM WG, once the process proposed here has been agreed upon.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Basic idea

   Two different IPPM implementations are expected to measure
   statistically equivalent results, if they both measure a metric under
   the same networking conditions.  Formulating the measurement in
   statistical terms: separate samples are collected (by separate metric
   implementations) from the same underlying statistical process (the
   same network conditions).  The "statistical hypothesis" to be tested
   is the expectation, that both samples expose statistically equivalent
   properties.  This requires careful test design:

   o  The error induced by the sample size must be small enough to
      minimize its influence on the test result.  This may have to be
      respected, especially if two implementations measure with
      different average probing rates.

   o  If time series are compared, the implementation with the lowest
      probing frequency determines the smallest temporal interval for
      which results can be compared.

   o  Every comparison must be repeated several times based on different
      measurement data to avoid random indications of compatibility (or
      the lack of it).

   o  The measurement test set up must be self-consistent to the largest
      possible extent.  This means, network conditions, paths and IPPM
      metric implementations SHOULD be identical for the compared
      implementations to the largest possible degree to minimize the
      influence of the test and measurement set up on the result.  This
      includes e.g. aspects of the stability and non-ambiguity of routes
      taken by the measurement packets.  See RFC 2330 for a discussion
      on self-consistency RFC 2330 [RFC2330].

   State of the art statistical methods are proposed for a comparison of
   measurement results in the hope that user friendly tools required to
   perform the necessary statistical analysis are easily accessible.
   [editor: this sentence may be reworded or deleted, if the expectation
   doesn't hold].

   Let's assume a one way delay measurement comparison between system A,
   probing with a frequency of 2 probes per second and system B probing



Geib & Fardid            Expires January 7, 2010                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard compliance testing           July 2009


   at a rate of 2 probes every 3 minutes.  To ensure reasonable
   confidence in results, sample metrics are calculated from at least 5
   singletons per compared time interval.  This means, sample delay
   values are calculated for each system for identical 6 minute
   intervals for the whole test duration.  Per 6 minute interval, the
   sample metric is calculated from 720 singletons for system A and from
   6 singletons for system B).  Note, that if outliers are not filtered,
   moving averages are an option for an evaluation too.  The minimum
   move of an averaging interval is three minutes in our example.

   The test set up for the delay measurement is chosen to minimize
   errors by locating one system of each implementation at the same end
   of two separate sites, between which delay is measured for the metric
   test.  Both measurement sites are connected by one IPSEC tunnel, so
   that all measurement packets cross the Internet with the same IP
   addresses.  Both measurement systems measure simultaneously and the
   local links are dimensioned to avoid congestion caused by the probing
   traffic itself.

   The measured delay values are reported with a resolution above the
   measurement error and above the synchronisation error.  This is done
   to avoid comparing these errors between two different metric
   implementations instead of comparing the IPPM metric implementation
   itself.

   The overall duration of the test is chosen so that more than 1000 six
   minute measurement intervals are collected.  The amount of data
   collected allows separate comparisons for e.g. 200 consecutive 6
   minute intervals. intervals, during which routes were instable, are
   discarded prior to evaluation.


3.  Verification of equivalence by statistic measurements

   Following the definition of statistical precision [Precision], a
   measurement process can be characterised by two properties:

   o  Accuracy, which is the degree of conformity of a measured quantity
      to its actual (true) value.

   o  Precision, also called reproducibility or repeatability, the
      degree to which repeated measurements show the same or similar
      results.

   Figure 1 further clarifies the difference between accuracy and
   precision of a measurement.

                                 Figure 1

   The Framework for IP Performance Metrics (RFC 2330, [RFC2330])
   expects that a "methodology for a metric should have the property
   that it is repeatable: if the methodology is used multiple times
   under identical conditions, it should result in consistent
   measurements."  This means, an IPPM implementation is expected to
   measure a metric with high precision.

   Further, RFC2330 expects that a "a methodology for a given metric
   exhibits continuity if, for small variations in conditions, it
   results in small variations in the resulting measurements.  Slightly
   more precisely, for every positive epsilon, there exists a positive
   delta, such that if two sets of conditions are within delta of each
   other, then the resulting measurements will be within epsilon of each
   other."  A small variation in conditions in the context of a metric
   comparison can be seen as two implementations measuring the same
   metric along the same path.

   Two guidelines for an IPPM conformant metric implementation can be
   taken from these principles:

   o  A single IPPM conformant implementation MUST under otherwise
      identical network conditions produce highly precise results for
      repeated measurements of the same metric.

   o  Two different implementations measuring the same IPPM metric MUST
      produce results with a rather limited difference if measuring
      under to the largest extent possible identical network conditions.

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard compliance testing           July 2009


   In a metric test, both conditions must hold, meaning that repeated
   tests of two implementations MUST produce precise results for all
   repetition intervals.

   A suitable statistical test and and a level of confidence to define
   whether differences are rather limited and whether a measurement is
   highly precise are specified below.

   RFC 2330 prefers the "empirical distribution function" EDF to
   describe collections of measurements.  RFC 2330 uses the EDF to test
   goodness of fit of an IPPM flow's inter packet spacing to a Poisson
   process.  To do that, RFC 2330 uses the Anderson-Darling test with a
   5% significance.  RFC 2330 further determines, that "unless otherwise
   stated, IPPM goodness-of-fit tests are done using 5% significance."

   The principles suggested by RFC 2330 are applied to compare the
   implementation of IPPM metrics as follows:

   o  The empirical distribution function of the singletons or samples
      resulting from the measurement of a particular metric is forming
      the basis of a comparison of two IPPM implementations.  Note that
      a parametric description of this distribution is not required.

   o  The hypothesis to be validated by an IPPM metric test is that two
      implementations of an IPPM metric draw probes from the same
      underlying distribution.  The hypothesis is true, if samples of
      two tested metric implementations follow the same distribution by
      a significance of 95%.  Note that the distribution function from
      which the probes are drawn itself is irrelevant.

   o  The samples taken by two implementations to be tested are compared
      by an Anderson-Darling k sample test.  The Anderson-Darling k
      sample test is the generalization of the classical Anderson-
      Darling goodness of fit test, and it is used to test the
      hypothesis that k independent samples belong to the same
      population without specifying their common distribution function.
      [Editor: I couldn't find a complete documentation of that test on
      the web by a fast search, but a reference to a publication is
      there and code seems to be available too.  Other tests which are
      documented in Wikipedia for that purpose are Kolmogorov-Smirnov
      and Chi-Square. it is proposed to make Anderson Darling k sample
      obligatory/a MUST if code can be appended to this draft.  If not,
      Anderson Darling k sample is recommended and Kolmogorov-Smirnov or
      Chi Square are optional].

   Getting back to the chosen example delay measurement, the captured
   delays may have been captured singletons ranging from an absolute
   minimum Delay Dmin to values Dmin + 5 ms.  To compare distributions,



Geib & Fardid            Expires January 7, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard compliance testing           July 2009


   the set of singletons of a chosen evaluation interval (e.g. the data
   of one of the five 1800 minute capture sequences, see above) is
   sorted for the frequency of singletons per Dmin + N * 0.5 ms (n = 1,
   2, ...).  After that, a comparison of the two probe sets with any of
   the mentioned tests may be applied.

   While constructing the example, some additional rules to calculate
   and compare samples have been respected.  The following two rules are
   of importance for the IPPM metric tests:

   o  To compare different probes of a common underlying distribution in
      terms of metrics characterising a communication network requires
      to respect the temporal nature for which the assumption of common
      underlying distribution may hold.  Any singletons or samples to be
      compared MUST be captured within the same time interval.

   o  Whenever sample metrics, samples of singletons or rates are used
      to characterise measured metrics of a time-interval, at least 5
      events of a relevant metric MUST be present to ensure a minimum
      confidence into the reported value (see Wikipedia on confidence
      [Rule of thumb]).  Note that this criterion is to be respected
      e.g. when comparing packet loss metrics.  Any packet loss
      measurement interval to be compared with the results of another
      implementation needs to contain at least five lost packets to have
      a minimum confidence that these losses didn't happen randomly.

   o  The minimum number of singletons or samples to be compared by an
      Anderson-Darling test is 100 per tested metric implementation.
      Note that the Anderson-Darling test detects small differences in
      distributions fairly well and will fail for high number of
      compared results (RFC2330 mentions an example with 8192
      measurements to guarantee a failure of an Anderson-Darling test).

   Comparing "Accuracy" of IPPM implementations based on averages and
   variations may require prior checks for the absence of long range
   dependency within the compared measurements.  Large outliers as
   typically occurring in the case of long range dependency, can have a
   serious impact on mean values.  The median or percentiles may be more
   robust measures on which to compare the accuracy of different IPPM
   implementations.  An idea may be to consider data up to a certain
   percentile, calculate the mean for data up to this percentile and
   then compare the means of the two implementations.  This could be
   repeated for different percentiles.  If long range dependencies
   impact is limited to large outliers, the method may work for lower
   percentiles.  Whether this makes sense must be confirmed by a
   statistician, so this attempt requires further study.

   IPPM metrics are captured by time series.  Time series can be checked

   for correlation.  There are two expectations on statistical time
   series properties which should be met by separate measurements
   probing the same underlying network performance distribution:

   o  The Autocorrelation indicates, whether there are any repeating
      patterns within a time series.  For the purpose of this document,
      it does not matter whether there is autocorrelation in a
      measurement.  It is however expected, that two measurements expose
      the same autocorrelation on identical "lag" intervals.  If
      calculable, the autocorrelation lies within an interval [-1;1],
      (see Wikipedia on autocorrelation [Autocorrelation]).

   o  The correlation coefficient "indicates the strength of a linear
      relationship between two random variables."  The two random
      variables in the case of this document are the measurement time
      series of the IPPM implementations to be compared.  The
      expectation is, that both are strongly correlated and the
      resulting correlation coefficient is close to 1, (see Wikipedia on
      correlation [Correlation]).

   A metric test can derive additional statistics from time series
   analysis.  Further, formulation of a test hypothesis is possible for
   autocorrelation and the correlation coefficient.  It is however not
   clear, whether an appropriate statistical test to validate the
   hypothesis by 95% significance exists.  Applicability of time series
   analysis for a metric test requires further input from statisticians.

   In the absence of any metric test on time series, any test result
   SHOULD provide the autocorrelation of the compared metrics time
   series by lags from 1 to 10.  In addition, the value of the
   correlation coefficient SHOULD be provided.  Autocorrelation and
   Correlation coefficient are expected to be rather close to the value
   1.

   As mentioned earlier, the time series analysis requires application
   of identical time intervals to allow a comparison.  In our delay
   example, single sample delay metric values are calculated for 9
   minute intervals.  If 200 consecutive sample delay metrics with the
   same start and end interval are available for each implementation,
   autocorrelation can be calculated for different n * 9 minute lags.
   The autocorrelation calculated for the time series of each
   implementation should be very close to the autocorrelation of the
   other implementation for the same time lag.  Further, the correlation
   coefficient for both time series should be close to 1.

   The way to prove that two IPPM metric measurements provide compatible
   results then could be performed stepwise:




Geib & Fardid            Expires January 7, 2010                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard compliance testing           July 2009


   o  First prove that the two compared implementations have the same
      precision by comparing statistics of the distribution of
      singletons (or samples) of a metric by comparing the EDF of the
      samples captured by the two implementations.

   o  Second indicate that two compared implementations produce strongly
      correlated time series of which each one individually has the same
      autocorrelation as the other one.

   Clock synchronization effects require special attention.  Accuracy of
   one-way active delay measurements for any metrics implementation
   depends on clock synchronization between the source and destination
   of tests.  Ideally, one-way active delay measurement (RFC 2679,
   [RFC2679]) test endpoints either have direct access to independent
   GPS or CDMA-based time sources or indirect access to nearby NTP
   primary (stratum 1) time sources, equipped with GPS receivers.
   Access to these time sources may not be available at all test
   locations associated with different Internet paths, for a variety of
   reasons out of scope of this document.

   When secondary (stratum 2 and above) time sources are used with NTP
   running acrossthe same network, whose metrics are subject to
   comparative implementation tests, network impairments can affect
   clock synchronization, distort sample one-way values and their
   interval statistics.  It is RECOMMENDED to discard sample one-way
   delay values for any implementation, when one of the following
   reliability conditions is met:

   o  Delay is measured and is finite in one direction, but not the
      other.

   o  Absolute value of the difference between the sum of one-way
      measurements in both directions and round-trip measurement is
      greater than X% of the latter value.

   Examination of the second condition requires RTT measurement for
   reference, e.g., based on TWAMP (RFC5357, RFC 5357 [RFC5357]), in
   conjunction with one-way delay measurement.

   Specification of X% to strike a balance between identification of
   unreliable one-way delay samples and misidentification of reliable
   samples under a wide range of Internet path RTTs probably requires

   An IPPM compliant metric implementation whose measurement requires
   synchonized clocks is however expected to provide precise measurement
   results.  Any IPPM metric implementation MUST be of a precision of 1
   ms (+/- 500 us) with a confidence of 95% if the metric is captured

   along an Internet path which is stable and not congested during a
   measurement duration of an hour or more.  [Editor: this latter
   definition may avoid NTP (stratum 2 or worse) synchonized IPPM
   implementations from becoming IPPM compliant.  However internal PC
   clock synched implementations can't be rejected that way.  Ideas on
   criteria to deal with the latter are welcome.  May drift be one, as
   GPS synched implementations shouldn't have one or the same on origin
   and destination, respectively].

   Metric tests should be executed under conditions which are identical
   to the largest possible or necessary extent.  As "identical network
   conditions" are fundamental to the nethodology proposed by this
   document, more input and a thorough discussion is needed to define
   these.  Some thoughts are:

   o  In a laboratory environment, NTP synchronisation may have a less
      serious impact.  In a real network, improper synchronisation will
      be harder to conceal.

   o  OWD measurements are of highest precision with well synchonized
      measurement systems measuring delays along a stable not congested
      path.  Care must be taken to avoid comparing noise and the
      measurement error respectively instead of the delay.

   o  Packet loss, delay variation and packet reordering require a
      sufficient number of these events to allow for a metric test with
      the desired confidence.  While one could wait for congestion or
      execute the test across known bottlenecks, this may incur some
      effort.  A question is, whether to test these metrics under
      laboratory conditions.  To generalise this question: can
      laboratory metric tests be tolerated for metrics whose precision
      doesn't depend on synchonized clocks?

   o  Packet loss and delay variation probably allow for a relaxed
      definition of "identical test conditions", as it may be sufficient
      for test packets to share the congested interface or paths to test
      for these metrics.

   o  In a laboratory environment, "stationary" networking conditions
      can be produced without having to care about parallel resources,
      applied by carriers to increase capacity.  In a commercial
      network, hashing functions (on addresses and ports) determine
      which set of resources all the packets in a flow will traverse.
      Testing in the lab may not remove the parallel resources, but it
      can provide some time stability that's never assured in live
      network testing.

   o  Applicability of tunnels to avoid the impact of unknown parallel
      resources applied by networks traversed by measuremenmts packets
      during a test should be investigated.

   o  To determine if some aspects of the metric specifications are
      clear and unambiguous, some specific conditions in the lab may be
      simulated to determine if implementations measure them as
      expected.  This it should be tested whether all implementors read
      the spec the same way.  Further, reducing some sources of
      variation right at the start, will make the job of statistical
      comparison simpler.

   o  Getting access to operator information like load and packet loss
      counters of a network which was used during a metric test is
      improbable.  But testing across a real network still is desirable
      for a metric test.


4.  Recommended Metric Verification Measurement Process

   The proposal made by the authors of bradner-metrictest
   [bradner-metrictest] is picked up and slightly enhanced:

   "In order to meet their obligations under the IETF Standards Process
   the IESG must be convinced that each metric specification advanced to
   Draft Standard or Internet Standard status is clearly written, that
   there are the required multiple verifiably equivalent
   implementations, and that all options have been implemented.

   "In the context of this memo, metrics are designed to measure some
   characteristic of a data network.  An aim of any metric definition
   should be that it should be specified in a way that can reliably
   measure the specific characteristic in a repeatable way."

   Each metric, statistic or option of those to be validated must be
   compared against a reference measurement or another implementation by
   at least 5 different basic data sets, each on with sufficient size to
   reach the specified level of confidence.

   "In the same way, sequentially running different implementations of
   software that perform the tests described in the metric document on a
   stable network, or simultaneously on a network that may or may not be
   stable should produce essentially the same results."

   Following these assumptions any recommendation for the advancement of
   a metric specification needs to be accompanied by an implementation
   report, as is the case with all requests for the advancement of IETF
   specifications.  The implementation report needs to include a

   specific plan to test the specific metrics in the RFC in lab or real-
   world networks and reports of the tests performed with two or more
   implementations of the software.  The test plan should cover key
   parts of the specification, specify the accuracy required for each
   measured metric and thus define the meaning of "statistically
   equivalent" for the specific metrics being tested.  Ideally, the test
   plan would co-evolve with the development of the metric, since that's
   when people have the most context in their thinking regarding the
   different subtleties that can arise.

   In particular, the implementation report MUST as a minimum document:

   o  The metric compared and the RFC specifying it, including the
      chosen options (like e.g. the implemented selection function in
      the case of IPDV).

   o  A complete specification of the measurement stream (mean rate,
      statistical distribution of packets, packet size (or mean packet
      size and their distribution), DSCP and any other measurement
      stream property which could result in deviating results.
      Deviations in results can be caused also if chosen IP addresses
      and ports of different implementations can result in different
      layer 2 or layer 3 paths due to operation of Equal Cost Multi-Path
      routing in an operational network

   o  The duration of each measurement to be used for a metric
      validation, the number of measurement points collected for each
      metric during each measurement interval (i.e. the probe size) and
      the level of confidence derived from this probe size for each
      measurement interval

   o  The result of the statistical tests performed for each metric
      validation.

   o  The measurement configuration and set up

   o  A parameterization of laboratory conditions and applied traffic
      and network conditions allowing reproduction of these laboratory
      conditions for readers of the implementation report.

   "All of the tests for each set MUST be run in the same direction
   between the same two points on the same network.  The tests SHOULD be
   run simultaneously unless the network is stable enough to ensure that
   the path the data takes through the network will not change between
   tests."

   It is RECOMMENDED to avoid effects falsifying results of real data
   networks, if validation measurements are taken over them.  Obviously,

Internet-Draft      IPPM standard compliance testing           July 2009


   the conditions met there can't be reproduced.  As the measurement
   equipment compared is designed to reliable quantify real network
   performance, validating metrics under real network conditions is
   desirable of course.

   Data networks may forward packets differently in the case of:

   o  Different packet sizes chosen for different metric
      implementations.  A proposed countermeasure is selecting the same
      packet size when validating results of two samples or a sample
      against an original distribution.

   o  Selection of differing IP addresses and ports used by different
      metric implementations during metric validation tests.  If ECMP is
      applied on IP or MPLS level, different paths can result (note that
      it may be impossible to detect an MPLS ECMP path from an IP
      endpoint).  A proposed counter measure is to connect the
      measurement equipment to be compared by a NAT device, or
      establishing a single tunnel to transport all measurement traffic
      The aim is to have the same IP addresses and port for all
      measurement packets or to avoid ECMP by a layer 2 tunnel.

   o  Different IP options.

   o  Different DSCP.

   The test design may have to be adapted for the purpose of the
   measurement.  Creation of delay and delay variation probes is simple
   and straightforward, also if the measurement runs acrossa real data
   network.  Collecting a large number of packet loss samples on a real
   data network while being sure that operational conditions are stable
   may not be feasible.  Further discussion on test designs to verify
   specific metrics may indeed be required.
