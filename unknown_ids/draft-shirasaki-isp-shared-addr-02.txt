Internet-Draft             ISP Shared Address                 March 2009


Abstract

   This document defines IPv4 ISP Shared Address to be jointly used
   among Internet Service Providers (ISPs).  This space is intended to
   be used in NAT444 model which is used during the transition period to
   IPv6.

Internet-Draft             ISP Shared Address                 March 2009


1.  Introduction

   The only permanent solution of the IPv4 address exhaustion is to
   deploy IPv6.  Now, just before the exhaustion, it's time to make a
   transition to IPv6.

   NAT444 model [I-D.shirasaki-nat444-isp-shared-addr] is one of the
   solutions for transition to IPv6.

   This document defines ISP Shared Address to be used in NAT444 model.
   It is supposed to be used between Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)
   and Large Scale NAT (LSN) [I-D.nishitani-cgn].

   ISP Shared Address is needed until the IPv4 Internet fades out.


2.  ISP Shared Address

2.1.  Definition

   ISP Shared Address is intended to be assigned between CPE and LSN in
   a NAT444.

2.2.  Details

   - Each ISP can use ISP Shared Address without any coordination with
   IANA or Internet registries.

   - ISP Shared Address can be used by many ISPs.

   - ISP has to install LSN to use ISP Shared Address.

   - ISP Shared Address must not be used at customers' site or Internet
   Exchanges.

   - Routing information of ISP Shared Address must not be advertised to
   the Internet.

   - Reverse DNS queries for this address space must not be sent to root
   DNS servers.

   - Packets with this space as source address and/or destination
   address must be filtered out at the border of each ISP.

   - Addresses within this address space should be unique within the
   ISP, or the set of ISPs which choose to cooperate over this space so
   they may directly communicate with each other in their networks.

3.  Size of Address Space

   Because the aggregation size of Tokyo area POP is around /10 in
   Japan, /10 should be the hard limit of minimum size ISP Shared
   Address.  We understand this can be determined by further
   discussions.


4.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks for the input and review by Shirou Niinobe, Takeshi Tomochika,
   Tomohiro Fujisaki, Dai Nishino, JP address community members, AP
   address community members and JPNIC members.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is to record the allocation of the IPv4 global unicast address
   as ISP Shared Address in the IPv4 address registry.


6.  Security Considerations

   ISP Shared Address is supposed to be used with LSN.  The Global IPv4
   address that is assigned outside LSN may be used as source address of
   'Denial of Service' attack.
