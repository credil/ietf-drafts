Requirement for Multi Stages Multiplexing Configuration in G.709 Optical
                           Transport Network
          draft-fuxh-ccamp-multi-stage-multiplex-config-req-00

Abstract

   Interworking between regions with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS has been
   considered in G.709.  Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing would
   be desirable to facilitate the introduction of new ODU0 and ODUflex
   signals to an existing network without having to upgrade every node
   in the network.  So ODU0/ODUflex can be mapped into ODU1/ODU2/ODU3
   and transit across the 2.5G TS region.

   Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing are also used to support the
   multi-domain OTN applications based on the tunnel design.  If there
   are a large number of circuits that share the same endpoints (or even
   part of an overall path), it may be convenient from a management
   perspective to first multiplex those ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex into ODU2
   or ODU3 to minimize the number of connections that need to be made in
   intermediate nodes.  The ODU2/ODU3 effectively creates a tunnel
   through the ODU4 network that the ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex can use.

   This document describes the requirement for multi stages multiplexing
   configuration for gateway network elements that are located at a
   domain boundary in G.709 Optical Transport Network.

Internet-Draft   Multi Stages Multiplexing Configuration      April 2010


1.  Introduction

   G.709 has supported a single stage of ODU multiplexing.  The
   practical consequence of this in OTN v1 is an ODU1 can be mapped
   directly to a tributary slot of an ODU3, without having to be first
   mapped into an ODU2.  The motivation for this architecture is
   reducing complexity.  In the normal progression of things, new
   additions to the OTN were expected to be at faster bit rates, and
   thus the single stage concept could be easily maintained going
   forward.

   The introduction of ODU0 and ODUflex to the OTN hierarchy creates a
   situation where the newly added ODUk signals have a bit rate that is
   lower than any of the existing signals, which presents some different
   challenges because the new signals can be clients of the existing
   signals.  As a result, there are clear applications where multi
   stages of multiplexing would be desirable to facilitate the
   introduction of these new ODU0 and ODUflex signals to an existing
   network without having to upgrade every node in the network.  Using
   multi stages of multiplexing allows the operator to confine the new
   rates to only those nodes that need to support them.

   A second potential application for multi stages outside of an upgrade
   scenario would be a network design based on tunnels.  Multi stages
   multiplexing are used to support the multi-domain OTN applications
   based on the tunnel design.

   This document describes the requirement for multi stages multiplex
   configuration in G.709 Optical Transport Network.


2.  Typical Use Case

2.1.  Multi Stages Multiplexing Configuration Requirement for
      Interworking Between Regions with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS

   In Figure 1, node 4, 5, 6 and 7 have ODU1 and ODU2 switching
   capability.  All nodes only support 2.5G TS granularity.  They can't
   support ODU0/ODUflex directly.  They could not have any visibility to
   the ODU0/ODUflex.

   In Figure 2, operator deploys three new 10G OTN networks, such as
   ODU2 Network 1, ODU 2 Network 3 and ODU2 Network 4.  All ODU2
   networks are interconnected with ODU3 network by OTU3 link.  All
   nodes of three ODU2 networks support the 1.25G TS granularity and are
   based on G.709 v3.  All nodes in ODU2 Network 1 and ODU2 Network 4
   can support ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex switching capability.  ODU2
   Network 3 is only desirable to support GigE and ODUflex services, so
   all nodes in ODU2 Network 3 only support ODU0 and ODUflex for more
   economical cost.  It doesn't support ODU1 (e.g., STM-16) application.

                                 Figure 2

   There are clear applications where 2 stages of multiplexing would be
   desirable to facilitate the introduction of these new ODU0 and
   ODUflex signals to an existing network without having to upgrade
   every node in the network.  In order for the interworking between
   1.25G TS and 2.5G TS networks, there must be some gateway nodes which
   are added at a domain boundary in order to support ODU0/ODUflex.
   Within the gateway nodes, multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing
   allow ODU0/ODUflex to be supported across the legacy network.  ODU0
   is mapped first to ODU1 or ODU2, and that ODU1/2 is then mapped into
   ODU3.  Nodes in the legacy network switch the ODU1/ODU2 without
   having any visibility to the ODU0/ODUflex.

   Whether ODU1 or ODU2 should be created for end-to-end ODU0 service
   depends on multi stages multiplexing capability of gateway.
   Different gateways may support different multi stages multiplexing
   capabilities based on the network planning and the capability of
   network element.

   Gateway 1 is supposed to support the following multi stages
   multiplexing/demultiplexing capability.

   o  ODU0-ODU1-ODU3

   o  ODU0-ODU2-ODU3

   o  ODU1-ODU2-ODU3

   o  ODUflex-ODU2-ODU3

   Gateway 3 is supposed to support the following multi stages
   multiplexing/demultiplexing capability.

   o  ODU0-ODU2-ODU3

   o  ODUflex-ODU2-ODU3

   Gateway 4 is supposed to support the following multi stages
   multiplexing/demultiplexing capability.  The operator limits the
   ODUflex application to the local network.  There is no any multi-
   domain ODUflex application which goes into ODU2 Network 4 and vice
   versa.  So it doesn't need to support the ODUflex-ODU2-ODU3
   multiplexing.

   o  ODU0-ODU1-ODU3

   o  ODU0-ODU2-ODU3

   There are several end-to-end services.

   o  E2E ODUflex 1 (e.g., 6*1.25G TS): It transit 1, 3, Gateway 1, 4,
      6, 7, Gateway 3 and 8.

   o  E2E GigE 1: It transit 1, 3,Gateway 1, 4, 6, 7, Gateway 3, 9 and
      10.

   o  E2E GigE 2: It transit 2, Gateway 1, 5, Gateway 4, 11 and 12.

   o  E2E STM-16 1: It transit 1, 2,Gateway 1, 5, Gateway 4 and 13.

   The E2E ODUflex 1 (e.g., 6*1.25G TS) and GigE 1 services share the
   same ODU2 tunnel between Gateway 1 and Gateway 3.  Multi stages
   multiplexing/demultiplexing capability must be configured with ODU0-
   ODU2-ODU3 in Gateway 1 and Gateway 3 for GigE 1 service.  Multi
   stages multiplexing/demultiplexing capability must be configured with
   ODUflex-ODU2-ODU3 in Gateway 1 and Gateway 3 for ODUflex 1 service.
   There is an ODU 1 tunnel between Gateway 4 and Gateway 1 for the E2E
   GigE 2 service.  Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing capability
   must be configured with ODU0-ODU1-ODU3 in Gateway 1 and Gateway 4 for
   GigE 2 service.  There is no any need to configure multi stages
   multiplexing/demultiplexing for STM-16 1 service.

2.2.  Multi Stages Multiplexing Configuration Requirement for Multi-
      Domain OTN Applications Based on Tunnel Design

   In Figure 3, operator deploys three new OTN networks again, such as
   ODU2 Network 5, ODU3 Network 7 and ODU4 Network 6.  ODU2 network 5
   and ODU3 network 7 are interconnected with ODU4 network by OTU4 link.
   All nodes of three new OTN networks support the 1.25G TS granularity
   and are based on the G.709 v3.  All nodes in ODU2 Network 5 support
   ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex switching capability.  All nodes in ODU3
   Network 7 support ODU0, ODU1, ODUflex and ODU2 switching capability.
   All nodes in ODU4 Network 6 only support ODU2 and ODU3 switching
   capability.

   In an ODU4 network, there are 80 tributary slots per ODU4.  Suppose
   there are a large number of multi-domain ODU0 and ODUflex demands.
   If there are a large number of circuits that share the same endpoints
   (or even part of an overall path), it may be convenient from a
   management perspective to first multiplex those ODU0 and ODUflex into
   ODU2 or ODU3 to minimize the number of connections that need to be
   made in intermediate nodes.  The ODU2/ODU3 effectively creates a

   tunnel through the ODU4 network that the ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex can
   use.

   In order for the tunnel network design, there must be some gateway
   nodes which are located at a domain boundary.  ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex
   can be mapped into ODU2/ODU3 first and that ODU2/ODU3 is then mapped
   into ODU4.

   ODU2 Network 3 is only desirable to support GigE and 10GigE services,
   so all nodes in ODU2 Network 3 only support ODU0 and ODUflex for more
   economical cost.  It doesn't support ODU1 (e.g., STM-16) application.

   Gateway 7 is supposed to support the following multi stages
   multiplexing/demultiplexing capability.  The operator limits the ODU1
   application to the local network.  There is no any multi-domain ODU1
   application which goes into ODU3 Network 7 and vice versa.  It
   doesn't need to support the ODU1-ODU2-ODU4 and ODU1-ODU3-ODU4
   multiplexing.

   Gateway 2 provides demultiplexing to recover the ODU2 from ODU4 and
   an additional multiplexing of the ODU2 to ODU3 and vice versa.

   There are several E2E services.

   o  E2E ODUflex 2 (e.g., 10*1.25G TS): It transit 16, Gateway 5, 17,
      19, 20, Gateway 7, 22 and 23.

   o  E2E GigE 3: It transit 14, 15, Gateway 5, 17, 19, 20, Gateway 7
      and 21.

   o  E2E GigE 4: It transit 15, Gateway 5, 17, 18, Gateway 2, 6, 7,
      Gateway 3, 9 and 10.

   o  E2E STM-16 2: It transit 15, Gateway 5, 17, 18, Gateway 2, 6,.

   In Figure 3, the E2E ODUflex 2 (e.g., 10*1.25G TS) and GigE 3
   services share the same ODU3 tunnel between Gateway 5 and Gateway 7.

   configured with ODUflex-ODU3-ODU4 in Gateway 5 and Gateway 7 for
   ODUflex 2 service.

   There is an ODU 2 tunnel between Gateway 5 and Gateway 3 for the E2E
   GigE 4 service.  Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing capability
   must be configured with ODU0-ODU2-ODU4 in Gateway 5 for GigE 4
   service.  Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing capability must be
   configured with ODU0-ODU2-ODU3 in Gateway 3 for GigE 4 service.

   There is an ODU 2 tunnel between Gateway 5 and Gateway 1 for the E2E
   STM-16 2 service.  Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing
   capability must be configured with ODU1-ODU2-ODU4 in Gateway 5 for
   STM-16 2 service.  Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing
   capability must be configured with ODU1-ODU2-ODU3 in Gateway 1 for
   STM-16 2 service.


3.  Requirement for Multi Stages Multiplexing Configuration

3.1.  Requirement in the level of the Data Plane

   This section describes the basic requirements in the Data Plane to
   support the multi stages multiplexing configuration functions of this
   document.

   o  Gateway network elements are only located at a domain boundary.
      Gateway equipment must support the multi stages multiplexing
      capability in order to introduce new ODU0 and ODUflex signals to
      an existing network and support multi-domain OTN application based
      on network tunnel design.

   o  Data Plane of gateway equipment must support different multi
      stages multiplexing hierarchy (e.g., two or three stages, and so
      on) and multiple multi stages multiplexing capability.

   o  Data Plane of gateway equipment must support the multi stages
      multiplexing configuration from Management Plane and/or Control
      Plane.  Gateway equipment must support to check the local data
      plane capability to see if this kind of multi stages multiplexing/
      demultiplexing from MP and/or CP is acceptable on specific
      interface or gateway node.

3.2.  Requirement in the level of Control Plane and Management Plane

   This section describes the basic requirements for procedures and
   processes that are used to perform the multi stages multiplexing
   configuration functions of this document.

   o  Management Plane must support configuration of multi stages
      multiplexing hierarchy.

      *  From the perspective of Management Plane, it must get multi
         stages multiplexing/demultiplexing capability of each gateway
         nodes for the service provision.

      *  Management Plane must support to config the multi stages
         multiplexing hierarchy which is determined by path computation
         entity into the Data Plane for the E2E service.

   o  Control Plane must support configuration of multi stages
      multiplexing hierarchy which is determined by path computation
      entity into the Data Plane.

      *  From the perspective of Control Plane, it must get multi stages
         multiplexing/demultiplexing capability of each gateway nodes
         for path computation.  It can get Multi stages multiplexing/
         demultiplexing information by Management Plane configuration.
         Path computation entity can use the IGP protocol or
         configurations from Management Plane to get these information.

      *  Path computation element must select a proper kind of multi
         stages multiplexing/demultiplexing hierarchy of gateway nodes
         along a specific E2E connection.

      *  Signaling message must carry the multi stages multiplexing/
         demultiplexing hierarchy that has been determined by path
         computation entity.  Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing
         hierarchy for a specific service must be configured to data
         plane after gateway receives the signaling of service creation.


4.  Security Considerations

   The use of control plane protocols for signaling, routing, and path
   computation opens an OTN to security threats through attacks on those
   protocols.  The data plane technology for an OTN does not introduce
   any specific vulnerabilities, and so the control plane may be secured
   using the mechanisms defined for the protocols discussed.  For
   further details of the specific security measures refer to the
   documents that define the protocols ([RFC3473], [RFC4203], [RFC4205],
   [RFC4204], and [RFC5440]).  [GMPLS-SEC] provides an overview of
   security vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms for the GMPLS
   control plane.
