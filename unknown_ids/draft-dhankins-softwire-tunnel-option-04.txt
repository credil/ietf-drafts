Internet-Draft               DS Lite Option                 October 2009


1.  Requirements Language

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "OPTIONAL",
   "RECOMMENDED", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Dual-Stack Lite [draft-ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite-01] is a method
   to extend IPv4 access to an IPv6-only addressed host.  One of its key
   components is an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel, commonly referred to as a
   Softwire, but a host will not know if the network it is attached to
   offers Dual-Stack Lite support, and if it did would not know the
   remote end of the tunnel to establish a connection.

   These are two separate pieces of information; 1) Should I shut down
   my dual-stack IPv4 side, and use the softwire exclusively for IPv4
   access? 2) At what IPv6 address should I establish a softwire
   connection?

   These two questions can be answered with one DHCPv6 [RFC3315] option.

   DISCUSSION: It can be argued that if you inform a client it should
   perform Dual-Stack Lite, but fail to deliver an IPv6 tunnel endpoint,
   then its IPv4 access is certainly broken.  If you give the client an
   IPv6 tunnel endpoint but fail to inform it that it must use Dual-
   Stack Lite for IPv4 access, then again its access is likely broken,
   or is operating in a degraded mode of service (if an operator offers
   a Dual-Stack Lite method of access, there either isn't any native
   IPv4 access, or the Dual-Stack Lite method works better than native
   access - if a network had better native IPv4 access than Dual-Stack
   Lite access, there would be no reason to extend the service).  So the
   presence of a tunnel address also indicates the operator's intent for
   the client to use the Softwire.


3.  The Dual-Stack Lite DHCPv6 Option

   The Dual-Stack Lite DHCPv6 Option is simply a list of IPv6 addresses
   in binary representation.

       |                                                               |
       |                          IPv6 Address 0                       |
       |                                                               |
       |                                                               |
       +---------------------------------------------------------------+
       |                                                               |
       |                          IPv6 Address 1                       |
       |                                                               |
       |                                                               |
       +---------------------------------------------------------------+
       |                                ...                            |
       +---------------------------------------------------------------+
       |                                                               |
       |                          IPv6 Address N                       |
       |                                                               |
       |                                                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The code for this option is TBD.  The length MUST be a multiple of
   16.  The IPv6 Address field is an IPv6 address.

   The DS Lite option MAY appear in the root scope of a DHCPv6 packet.
   It MUST NOT appear inside any IA_NA, IA_TA, IA_PD, IAADDR, or
   similar.

   If configured with a value, DHCPv6 servers will include the DS Lite
   option if it appears on the client's Option Request Option
   (OPTION_ORO).  RFC 3315 Section 17.2.2 [RFC3315] describes how a
   DHCPv6 client and server negotiate configuration values using the
   ORO.

   A client that supports DS Lite MUST include OPTION_DS_LITE on its
   OPTION_ORO.  There is no reasonable expectation that a server will
   reply with the DS Lite option if it has not been requested.

   If the client receives a DS Lite Option, it MUST verify the option
   length is precisely a multiple of 16 octets, and ignore the option
   otherwise.  Provided it is of valid length, the client SHOULD
   terminate or withdraw any DHCPv4 [RFC2131] configuration on the same
   interface.  If DHCPv4 configuration has concluded, the client SHOULD
   perform a DHCPRELEASE as it tears down its IPv4 configuration.

   The client SHOULD establish a Softwire tunnel to the first IPv6
   address ("IPv6 Address 0"), and incrementally attempt the next
   address in series ("IPv6 Address 1" etc) if present until a Softwire
   can be established.  The specifics of timeout intervals are not
   mentioned.

   If at any time the Softwire is forcibly disconnected, the client MUST
   restart connection at the start of the list.  Note carefully that
   through normal DHCPv6 Renew processes, the option's contents may be
   updated, and fresh versions of the configuration should be obtained
   from the DHCPv6 client in a timely manner.

   DISCUSSION: The author believes that as Softwires are a "routing
   layer" solution, they are likely to be managed in networks using
   routing layer tools - the application of anycasting, or simply the
   use of "role addresses" that can be quickly re-routed from failed
   servers and applied to surviving servers.  This argues a
   simplification for the client to be given only one IPv6 address, as
   the routing layer can ensure that address is terminated in the most
   useful place.  However, upon further discussion it seems to the
   author that it is also necessary to provide routing protocol
   operators to employ more than one route; so that faults with one
   route in the table are not devastating.  For this purpose, (N)
   addresses are made available.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not present any new security issues, but as with
   all DHCPv6-derived configuration state, it is completely possible
   that the configuration is being delivered by a third party (Man In
   The Middle).  As such, there is no basis to trust that the access the
   DS-Lite softwire connection represents can be trusted, and it should
   not therefore bypass any security mechanisms such as IP firewalls.

   RFC 3315 [RFC3315] discusses DHCPv6 related security issues.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate one DHCPv6 Option code, referencing
   this document.
