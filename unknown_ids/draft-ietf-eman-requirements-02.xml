    <!-- Introduction =================================================== -->
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>With rising energy cost and with an increasing awareness of the
      ecological impact of running IT and networking equipment, energy
      management is becoming an additional basic requirement for network 
      management systems and frameworks.</t>

      <t>This document defines requirements for standards specifications 
      for energy management. Defined requirements concern monitoring
      functions as well as control functions. Covered functions include
      monitoring of power supply, actual power, power states, energy 
      consumption and context of managed entities as well as the 
      configuration of entities' power states. Note that this document 
      does not specify the features that must be implemented by compliant 
      implementations but rather features that must be defined by standards
      for energy management.</t>
      
      <t>Managed entities include devices that have an IP address 
      and can be addressed directly, such as hosts, routers, and 
      middleboxes, as well as devices indirectly connected to an 
      IP network, for which a proxy with an IP address provides a 
      management interface, for example, devices in a building 
      energy management infrastructure using BACNET or MODBUS 
      protocols.</t>
      
      <t>The requirements explicitly concern the standards specification
      process and not the implementation of specified standards.
      All requirements in this document must be reflected by standards 
      specifications to be developed based on these requirements. But 
      which of the features specified by these standards will be 
      mandatory, recommended, or optional for compliant implementations
      will be defined in the concrete standards track document(s) 
      and not in this document.</t>

      <t>This document first discusses general objectives of 
      energy management in <xref target="goals"/>. Requirements
      are specified in Sections <xref format="counter" target="identity"/> 
      to <xref format="counter" target="controlother"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="conventional" 
               title="Conventional requirement for energy management">
        <t>The specification of requirements for an energy management
        standard starts with <xref target="identity"/> addressing 
        general issues of entity identification and granularity of 
        reporting of energy-related information. A standard must 
        support unique identification of powered entities. Furthermore, 
        it must support more than just reporting per powered device.  
        Support is required for reporting energy-related information
        on individual components of a device or subtended devices.  
        This is why this draft uses the more general term "powered 
        entity" rather than "powered device". An entity may be a 
        device or a component of a device.</t>

        <t><xref target="properties"/> specifies requirements related 
        to monitoring of powered entities. This includes general 
        (type, context) information and specific information on
        power states, power inlets, power outlets, power, energy, 
        and batteries. Control power state and power supply of powered 
        entities is covered by requirements specified in 
        <xref target="control"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Specific requirements for energy management">

        <t>At first glance the rather conventional requirements
        summarized above seem to be all that would be needed for
        energy management. But it turns out that there are 
        some significant differences between energy management and 
        most of the well known conventional network management functions.
        The most significant difference from many other management
        functions is the need to report on others. There are three
        major reasons for this.

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>For monitoring and controlling a particular powered 
          entity in general it is not sufficient to communicate with 
          the entity only, but in many cases also communication with 
          other entities along the power distribution path may be 
          necessary, for example, with power switches and power meters. 
          Indeed, there are situations where a power or energy meter 
          is not located in the powered entity, but in a different 
          physical location. For example, a Power Distribution Unit 
          (PDU), which supplies power for a server connected to a 
          PDU socket, would meter the power supplied, while the server 
          may not have the capability to measure its power consumption. 
          A second example is a Power over Ethernet port, which 
          provides power to the attached device, and which can meter 
          how much power/energy it offers to the attached device.</t>
      
          <t>Energy management often extends its scope beyond 
          entities with IP network interfaces, for example toward
          non-IP building networks, that are accessed via an IP gateway. 
          Requirements in this document do not fully cover all these 
          networks, but they cover means for opening IP network 
          management towards them.</t>

          <t>For monitoring of particular powered entities, it is 
          sometimes not a scalable approach to communicate with all 
          the powered entities directly from a central energy 
          management system as the number of powered entities keeps 
          increasing.</t> 
        </list></t>
        
        <t>This specific issues of energy management and a set of 
        further ones are covered by requirements specified in Sections
        <xref format="counter" target="reportonother"/> and
        <xref format="counter" target="controlother"/>.</t>

    <!-- Terminology ==================================================== -->
    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

      <section toc="exclude" title="Energy">
        <t>Electric Energy is needed for operating electric 
        entities. These entities "consume" electric energy by 
        converting it to thermal energy (heat) or other kinds of 
        energy while conducting their operational tasks. For energy
        management, the total energy converted by an entity during 
        a time interval is of interest.</t>

        <t>The term 'energy consumption' is commonly used for both, 
        for referring to the amount of consumed energy and also 
        for referring to the process of consuming energy. In the 
        first case it addresses consumed energy, in the second one 
        it addresses power, typically an average power.</t>  
      </section>

      <section toc="exclude" title="Power">
        <t>Power is defined as energy conversion rate. For energy 
        management, the instantaneous power of a managed entity may 
        be of interest as well as the average power over a time 
        interval.</t>
      </section>

<!-- ???? 
      <section title="Demand">
        <t>Demand is defined as energy measurement over finite time intervals </t>
      </section>
-->

      <section toc="exclude" title="Powered entity">
        <t>A powered entity is a consumer of energy that is subject
        to energy management. In general, all managed physical 
        entities in a communication network consume electric energy
        and thus are subject to energy management including 
        particularly energy monitoring and energy control.</t>
        
        <t>A powered entity can be a managed device or a component 
        of a managed device, which is monitored individually.</t>
      </section>

      <section toc="exclude" title="Power state">
        <t>Power state of an entity is defined as a specific settings 
        of an entity that influences its power.  Examples of power 
        states of an entity are on, off, hibernate, and sleep.</t>
      </section>

      <section toc="exclude" title="Power monitor">
        <t>Energy management requires retrieving energy-related
        information on powered entities. In many cases this 
        information is not available at the entities themselves,
        but at other entities. For example measurement of power and
        energy consumption can be conducted by power meters at 
        other locations along the power distribution tree for 
        the powered entity.</t>

        <t>A power monitor is a module that reports energy-related 
        information on powered entities. A power monitor may be 
        integrated into a powered entity or located remotely of
        the powered entity. Instances of power monitors may report
        information on, for example, power supply, power, and power 
        state of a powered entity. There may be multiple power 
        monitors reporting information on the same powered entity.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section toc="exclude" title="Power inlet">
        <t>Powered entities receive power at their power inlets.  
        Powered entities may have multiple inlets, for example, 
        servers with redundant power supply. Examples for 
        power inlets are AC power cords of an entity or an
        Ethernet port at which the entity receives DC Power over 
        Ethernet (PoE).</t>
      </section>

      <section toc="exclude" title="Power outlet">
        <t>Entities may have means to supply others with electrical
        power. Power is delivered to other entities through power
        outlets. Power sourcing entities often have more than one power 
        outlet. Examples for power outlets are AC power sockets at
        a Power Distribution Unit (PDU) and Ehternet ports at a
        Power over Ethernet (PoE) Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE),
        that can supply entities with DC power using the Ethernet
        cable.</t>
      </section>

      <section toc="exclude" title="Energy management">
        <t>Energy management deals with assessing and influencing the
        consumption of energy in a network of powered entities. 
        A typical objective of energy management is reducing the energy
        consumption in the network. Ways towards achieving this 
        objective may be limited by other objectives of a general 
        network management system, such as service level objectives.</t>
      </section>

      <section toc="exclude" title="Energy management standard">
        <t>This document specifies requirements for an energy management 
        standard. This term refers to a collections of documents 
        specifying standards for energy-related monitoring and control.
        The energy management standard specifies means for building 
        energy management systems.</t> 
        <t>Requirements specified in this document
        concern the means that an energy management standard must
        provide. It does not imply that all required means must be 
        implemented in all energy standard scenarios. Which means and 
        features must be implemented by compliant implementations is to
        be specified by the energy management standard itself, not by
        this requirements document.</t>
        <t>Note that for meeting individual requirements specified 
        in this document not necessarily new standards are required.
        It is recommended to rather use existing standards than 
        specify new ones.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <!-- Objectives ===================================================== -->
    <section anchor="goals" title="General Objectives of Energy Management">
      <t>The basic objective of energy management is operating 
      communication networks and other equipment with minimal amount 
      of energy, while maintaining a certain level of service. 
      A set of use cases for energy management can be found in 
      <xref target="I-D.tychon-eman-applicability-statement"></xref>.
      </t>  

      <section anchor="powerstates" title="Power states">
        <t>One approach to achieve this goal is by setting all 
        powered entities to an operational state that results in 
        lower energy consumption, but still meets the service level 
        performance objectives. The sufficient performance level 
        may vary over time and can depend on several factors. 
        In principle, there are four basic types of power states 
        for a powered entity or for a whole system:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>full power state</t>
          <t>reduced power states (lower clock rate for processor, 
          lower data rate on a link, etc.)</t>
          <t>sleep (stand-by) state (not functional, but immediately 
          available)</t>
          <t>power-off state (may imply requiring significant time 
          for becoming operational)</t>
        </list>
        In actual implementations the number of power 
        states and their properties vary a lot. Very simple powered 
        entities may just have only the extreme states, full power 
        and power-off state. Some implementations might use 
        IEEE1621 model of three states on, off, and sleep. However, 
        more granular power states can be implemented with many 
        levels of reduced power and/or sleep states.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="tradeoffs" title="Trade-offs">
        <t>While the general objective of energy management is quite 
        clear, the way to attain that goal is often difficult. 
        In many cases there is no way of reducing power consumption 
        without the consequence of a potential performance, service, 
        or capacity degradation. Then a trade-off needs to be dealt 
        with between service level objectives and energy efficiency. 
        In other cases a reduction of energy consumption can easily 
        be achieved while still maintaining sufficient service level 
        performance, for example, by switching powered entities to 
        lower power states when higher performance is not needed.</t> 
      </section>

      <section anchor="localglobal" title="Local and network-wide
      energy management">
        <t>Many energy saving functions can be executed locally by 
        an entity. The basic principle is that an entity monitors its 
        usage and dynamically adapts its energy consumption according 
        to the required performance. In the extreme case, an entity 
        switches to a sleep state when it is not in use at all. 
        Potential interactions with an energy management system for 
        such an entity include the observation of the entity's power 
        state and the configuration of power saving policies, for
        example, by setting thresholds for power state changes.</t>

        <t>Energy savings can also be achieved with policies 
        implemented by a network management system that controls 
        power states of managed entities. In order to make policy 
        decisions properly, information about the energy consumption 
        of entities in different power states is required. Often this 
        information is acquired best through monitoring.</t>
        
        <t>Both methods, network-wide and local energy management,
        have advantages and disadvantages. In some cases for example,
        significant energy savings can be achieved by simply setting 
        all entities in a network to sleep, when the network is not 
        needed. However, in general it is dangerous to set all 
        entities of a group to the same state, because there is a
        risk that such actions ignore specifics of individual 
        entities or violate local service level agreements.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="monitoring" title="Energy monitoring">
        <t>It should be noted that only monitoring energy consumption 
        and power states is obviously not a means to reduce the energy
        consumption of an entity. In fact, it is likely to increase 
        the power consumption of an entity slightly. The reason is 
        that monitoring energy requires instrumentation that consumes
        energy when in use. And also reporting of measured quantities
        over the network consumes energy.  However, the 
        acquired energy consumption and power state information is

        <t>From the considerations described above the following

    <!-- Requirements related to Identity of entities ===========  -->
    <section anchor="identity" title="Identification of Powered Entities">
      <t>As already stated <xref target="conventional"/>, entities 
      on which energy-related information is provided are identified
      in a sufficiently unique way. This holds in particular for
      entities that are components of managed devices and in case
      that one entity reports information on another one, see 
      <xref target="reportonother"/>. But also for powered entities 
      that control other powered entities it is important to
      identify the entities they control, see 
      <xref target="controlother"/>.</t>      
      
      <t>Also stated already in <xref target="conventional"/> is the
      requirement of providing means for reporting energy-related
      information on components of a managed device. An entity in 
      this document may be an entire managed device or just a 
      component of it. Examples of components of interest are 
      a hard drive, a battery, or a line card. Also for controlling
      entities it may be useful to be able to address individual 
      components in order to save energy. For example, server blades 
      can be switched off when the overall load is low or line cards
      at switches may be switched off at night times.</t>
        
      <t>Instrumentation for measuring energy consumption of a
      device is typically more expensive than instrumentation for
      retrieving the devices power state. It may be a reasonable 
      compromise in many cases to provide power state information 
      for all individually switchable components of a device 
      separately, while the energy consumption is only measured for 
      the entire device.</t>

      <section anchor="state" title="Power state">
        <t>Many entities have a limited number of discrete power states, 
        such as, for example, full power, low power, standby, hibernating, 
        and off.</t>
        
        <t>Obviously, there is a need to report the actual power state
        of an entity. Beyond that, there is also a requirement for 
        standardizing means for retrieving the list of all supported 
        power states of an entity.</t>
        
        <t>Different standards bodies have already defined their own
        sets of power states for powered entities. Further organizations 
        are in the process of adding more of these sets. In order to 
        support multiple management systems possibly using different 
        power state sets, while simultaneously interfacing with a 
        particular entity, the energy management standard must provide 
        means for supporting multiple power state sets used 
        simultaneously at a powered entity. </t>

        <t>Some of the power states may have parameters that describe 
        the power state with device's functional capabilities 
        and are represented precisely by numeric values. 
        For example, in low power state, a reduced clock rate may be 
        set to a large number of different values. Since state parameters
        vary a lot from implementation to implementation it is not 
        considered a requirement to define standards for reporting 
        all those power states parameters. However, it would be useful
        to have standardized means for reporting some key parameters,
        such as mean power and maximum power of a device in a certain
        state.</t>

        <t>There also is a need to report statistics on power states
        including the time spent an the energy consumed in a power state.</t>

        <t>For some network management tasks, it may be desirable to 
        receive notifications from devices, for example, when the 
        components or the entire device change their power state.</t>

      <section anchor="inlet" title="Power inlet and power outlet">
        <t>Powered entities have power inlets at which they are 
        supplied with electric power. Many entities just have a 
        single power inlet, while others have multiple ones. 
        Often different power inlets are connected to separate 
        power distribution trees. For energy monitoring, 
        it is important information which power inlets an entity has, 
        if power is available at an inlet and which of them are 
        actually in use.</t>
        
        <t>Some entities have power outlets for supplying other entities
        with electric power. An entity may have multiple power outlets. 
        Examples are a Power Distribution Units (PDU) and a Power over
        Ethernet (PoE) Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE).</t>                                         

        <t>For identifying and potentially controlling the source of 
        power received at an inlet, it is useful to identify the power
        outlet of another entity at which the received power is 
        provided. Analogously, for each outlet it is of interest to

        <t>Static properties of each power inlet and each power outlet

      <section anchor="power" title="Power">
        <t>Power is a quantity measured as instantaneous power or 
        as average power over a time interval. In contrast to power 
        state values, this quantity may change continuously.</t>

        <t>Obtaining highly accurate values for power and energy may be costly. 
        Often dedicated metering hardware is needed for this purpose. 
        Entities without the ability to measure their power and energy 
        consumption with high accuracy may just report estimated values, 
        for example based on load monitoring or even just the device type.</t>
        
        <t>Depending on how power and energy consumption values are 
        obtained the confidence in the reported value and its accuracy 
        may vary. Entities reporting such values should qualify the 
        confidence in the reported values and quantify the accuracy 
        of measurements. For reporting accuracy, the accuracy classes 
        specified in <xref target="IEC.62053-21">IEC 62053-21</xref> 
        and <xref target="IEC.62053-22">IEC 62053-22</xref> should be 
        considered.</t>

        <t>In addition to the plain real power value, also further
        properties of the supplied power are subject 
        to monitoring. In case of AC power supply, there are more 
        power values beyond the real power to be reported including 
        the apparent power, the reactive power, and the phase angle 
        of the current or the power factor. For both AC and DC
        power the  power quality is also subject of monitoring.
        Power quality parameters include the actual voltage, the 
        actual frequency, the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of
        voltage and current, the impedance of an AC phase or of the
        DC supply. Power quality monitoring should be in line with
        existing standards, such as <xref target="IEC.61850-7-4"/>.</t>

        <t>For some network management tasks, it is required to 
        obtain time series of power values (or energy consumption 
        values). In general these could be obtained in many different 
        ways. It should be avoided that such time series can only be 
        obtained by regular polling by the energy management system. 
        Means should be provided to either push such values from the 
        place they are available to the management system or to have 
        them stored at the device for a sufficiently long period of

      <section anchor="energy" title="Energy">
        <t>Monitoring of electrical energy consumed (or converted) at
        an entity can be done in various ways. One is collecting
        time series of power values for the entity and calculating
        the consumed energy from these values. an alternative is the
        entity itself or another entity taking care of energy 
        measurement and reporting energy consumption values for 
        certain time intervals. Time intervals of interest are
        the time from the last restart of the entity to the reporting
        time, the time from another past event to the reporting time,
        or the last given amount of time before the reporting time.</t>
        
        <t>In order to monitor energy consumption in different power 
        states, it is useful if entities record their energy 
        consumption per power state and report these quantities.</t>

        <t>For some network management tasks, it is required to 
        obtain time series of energy values. In general these could 
        be obtained in many different ways. It should be avoided that 
        such time series can only be obtained by regular polling by 
        the energy management system. 
        Means should be provided to either push such values from the 
        place they are available to the management system or to have 
        them stored at the device for a sufficiently long period of 
        time such that a management system can retrieve a stored time 
        series of values.</t>

        <t>Today more and more managed devices contain batteries that 
        supply them with power when disconnected from electrical power 
        distribution grids.  Common examples are nomadic and mobile 
        devices, such as notebook computers, netbooks, and smart phones.
        The status of batteries in such a device, particularly the 
        charging status is typically controlled by automatic functions 
        that act locally on the device and manually by users of the 
        device. In addition to this, there is a need to monitor

    <!-- Requirements related to Powered Entities Configuration ============= -->
    <section anchor="control" title="Control of Powered Entities">
      <t>Many entities control their power state locally by 
      self-managed dynamic adaptation to the environment. But other
      devices without that capability need interfaces for a energy 
      management system to control their power states in order to
      save energy. Even for self-managed entities such interface may
      be useful for overruling local policy decisions by global ones
      from an energy management system.</t>

      <t>Power supply is typically not self-managed by powered entities.
      And controlling power supply is typically not conducted as 
      interaction between energy management system and the powered 
      entity itself. It is rather an interaction between the management
      system and an entity providing power at its power outlets. 
      Still, requirements for power state control apply accordingly 
      to power supply control.</t>
      
      <t>Note that shutting down the power supply abruptly may have 
      severe consequences for the powered entity.</t>

      <t>As already discussed in the introduction of 
      <xref target="properties"/>, not all energy-related information 
      may be available at the concerned powered entity. Such 
      information may be provided by other entities, such as a 
      Power Distribution Unit (PDU), external power meter, or a
      Power over Ethernet (PoE) Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE).
      Some of these entities (PDU, PSE) can also control the power 
      provided to the other powered devices, while some can just 
      report on the remote powered devices (external power meter). 
      This section covers reporting of information (monitoring)
      only. Please see <xref target="controlother"/> for requirements
      on controlling other entities</t>
      
      <t>There are cases where a power supply device switches power 
      for several powered entities by turning power on or off at a 
      single power outlet or where a power meter measures the 
      accumulated power of several devices at a single power line.  
      Consequently, it should be possible to report that a monitored 
      value does not relate to just a single powered entity, 
      but is an accumulated value for a set of powered entities. 
      All of these entities belonging to that set need to be 
      identified. </t>

      <t> The typical security threats for the management protocol for energy

      In other words, from an energy monitoring point of view, no additional security

      <t> In terms of monitoring, considering that there can be some network entities 
      which shall be entitled to collect the measured data on behalf of other devices, 
      then it is important to authenticate and/or authorize such devices. 
      In addition, in the case of control of other devices, it would be highly desirable 
      to have some form of an authentication mechanism to ensure that only the designated 
      devices shall control the devices within its control domain. It should be possible 
      to prevent a device which does not have the appropriate authorization and authority 
      to control or configure devices in its control 
      domain/purview. Secondly, it should be possible to prevent malicious network 
      devices exercising control over network devices. </t>

         <t>For some network management tasks it may be desirable to

         of an entity exceeds or falls below certain thresholds. 
         Do we want to make this a requirement?</t>

      <section title="Inlet/outlet combinations">
        <t>How to model the case that an inlet or outlet changes 
        during operation from one kind to the other. An example is
        a battery that receives power at a socket at one time. Then
        the socket is an inlet. At another time the battery provides
        power at the same socket. Then it's an outlet. The same 
        holds for devices with integrated power generators.</t>
        
        <t>One solution would be to introduce a new kind of hybrid 
        in/outlets. Another one would be to model the same socket 
        as inlet as well as as outlet. It would appear twice in the
        list of all inlets and outlets. Then received power/energy 
        would be reported under the inlet entry and provided 
        power/energy would be reported under the outlet entry.</t>

  <section anchor="standards" title="Existing Standards">
      <t>This section analyzes existing standards for energy consumption and
      power state monitoring. It shows that there are already several standards
      that cover only some part of the requirements listed above, but even all
      together they do not cover all of the requirements for energy 
      management.</t>

      <section title="Existing IETF Standards">
        <t>There are already RFCs available that address a subset of the
        requirements.</t>

    
         <section title="ENTITY MIB">
          <t>The ENTITY-MIB module defined in <xref target="RFC4133"/> was 
          designed to model physical and logical entities of a managed system. 
          A physical entity is an identifiable physical component. A logical entity 
          can use one or more physical entities. From an energy monitoring 
          perspective of a managed system, the ENTITY-MIB modeling framework 
          can be reused and whenever <xref target="RFC4133">RFC 4133</xref> 
          has been implemented. The entPhysicalIndex from entPhysicalTable 
          can be used to identify an entity/component. However, there are use 
          cases of energy monitoring, where the application of the ENTITY-MIB 
          does not seem readily apparent and some of those entities could be 
          beyond the original scope and intent of the ENTITY-MIB.</t>  

          <t>Consider the case of remote devices attached to the network, 
          and the network device could collect the energy measurement and 
          report on behalf of such attached devices. Some of the remote 
          devices such as PoE phones attached to a switch port have been 
          considered in the Power-over-Ethernet MIB module <xref target="RFC3621"/>.  
          However, there are many other devices such as a computer, 
          which draw power from a wall outlet or building HVAC devices which 
          seem to be beyond the original scope of the ENTITY-MIB.</t>  
          
          <t>Yet another example, is smart-PDUs, which can report 
          the energy consumption of the device attached to the power 
          outlet of the PDU. In some cases, the device can be attached 
          to multiple to power outlets. Thus, the energy measured at 
          multiple outlets need to be aggregated to determine the consumption 
          of a single device.  From mapping perspective, between the PDU 
          outlets and the device this is a many-to-one mapping. It is not 
          clear if such a many-to-one mapping is feasible within the 
          ENTITY-MIB framework.</t>
         </section>

        <section title="ENTITY STATE MIB">
          <t><xref target="RFC4268">RFC 4268</xref> defines the ENTITY STATE
          MIB module. Implementations of this module provide information on
          entities including the standby status (hotStandby, coldStandby,
          providingService), the operational status (disabled, enabled,
          testing), the alarm status (underRepair, critical, major, minor,
          warning), and the usage status (idle, active, busy). This
          information is already useful as input for policy decisions and for
          other network management tasks. However, the number of states would 
          cover only a small
          subset of the requirements for power state monitoring and it does
          not provide means for energy consumption monitoring.  
          For associating the information conveyed by the ENTITY STATE MIB to 
          specific components of a device, 
          the ENTITY STATE MIB module makes use of the means provided by the 
          <xref target="RFC4133">ENTITY MIB module</xref>. Particularly, it 
          uses the entPhysicalIndex for identifying entities.</t>
          <t>The standby status provided by the ENTITY STATE MIB module is 
          related to power states required for energy management, but the
          number of states is too restricted for meeting all energy management 
          requirements.
          For energy management several more power states are required, 
          such as different sleep and operational states as defined by 
          the 
          <xref target="ACPI.R30b">Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)</xref>
          or the
          <xref target="DMTF.DSP1027">DMTF Power State Management Profile</xref>.</t>
          
        </section>

        <section title="ENTITY SENSOR MIB">
          <t><xref target="RFC3433">RFC 3433</xref> defines the ENTITY SENSOR
          MIB module. Implementations of this module offer a generic way to
          provide data collected by a sensor. A sensor could be an energy
          consumption meter delivering measured values in Watt. This could be
          used for reporting current power of a device and its components. 
          Furthermore, the ENTITY SENSOR MIB can be used to retrieve the 
          accuracy of the used power meter.</t>

          <t>Similar to the ENTITY STATE MIB module, the ENTITY SENSOR MIB
          module makes use of the means provided by the <xref
          target="RFC4133">ENTITY MIB module</xref> for relating provided
          information to components of a device. </t>
          
          <t>However, there is no unit available for reporting energy
          quantities, such as, for example, watt seconds or kilowatt hours,
          and the ENTITY SENSOR MIB module does not support reporting 
          accuracy of measurements according to the IEC / ANSI accuracy
          classes, which are commonly in use for electric power and energy
          measurements. The ENTITY SENSOR MIB modules only provides a 
          coarse-grained method for indicating accuracy by stating the 
          number of correct digits of fixed point values.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="UPS MIB">
          <t><xref target="RFC1628">RFC 1628</xref> defines the UPS MIB
          module. Implementations of this module provide information on the
          current real power of devices attached to an uninterruptible power
          supply (UPS) device. This application would require identifying
          which device is attached to which port of the UPS device.</t>
          
          <t>UPS MIB provides information on the state of the UPS network.  
          The MIB module contains several variables that are used to identify 
          the UPS entity (name, model,..), the battery state, to characterize 
          the input load to the UPS, to characterize the output from 
          the UPS, to indicate the various alarm events.  The 
          measurements of power in UPS MIB are in Volts, Amperes and Watts.
          The units of power measurement are RMS volts, RMS Amperes and 
          are not based on Entity-Sensor MIB [RFC3433].</t>
        </section>

        <section title="POWER ETHERNET MIB">
          <t>Similar to the UPS MIB, implementations of the POWER ETHERNET MIB
          module defined in <xref target="RFC3621">RFC3621</xref> provide
          information on the current energy consumption of the devices that 
          receive Power over Ethernet (PoE). This information can be retrieved 
          at the power sourcing equipment. Analogous to the UPS MIB, it is 
          required to identify which devices are attached to which port 
          of the power sourcing equipment.</t>
          
          <t>The  POWER ETHERNET MIB does not report power and energy 
          consumption on a per port basis, but can report aggregated values 
          for groups of ports. It does not use objects of the ENTITY MIB 
          module for identifying entities, although this module existed 
          already when the POWER ETHERNET MIB modules was standardized.</t>

        <section title="LLDP MED MIB">
          <t>The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) defined in IEEE
          802.1ab is a data link layer protocol used by network devices 
          for advertising of their identities, capabilities, and 
          interconnections on a LAN network.  
              
          The Media Endpoint Discovery (MED) (ANSI/TIA-1057) is an enhancement 
          of LLDP known as LLDP-MED. The LLDP-MED enhancements specifically 
          address voice applications.  LLDP-MED covers 6 basic areas: 
          capabilities discovery, LAN speed and duplex discovery, 
          network policy discovery, location identification discovery, 
          inventory discovery, and power discovery.</t>

          It is based on the DMTF's Common Information Model (CIM) and rather

          standard.</t>

          <t>The power state management profile is used to describe and to

          <t> The charter of the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working Group is for 
          open standards that define printer related protocols, that printer manufacturers and related 
          software vendors shall benefit from the interoperability provided by conformance to these standards.
          One particular aspect the Printer WG is focused on is power monitoring and management of network 
          printers and imaging systems <xref target="IEEE-ISTO">PWG Power Management Model for Imaging Systems </xref>. 
          Clearly, these devices are within the scope of energy management since 
          these devices consume power and are attached to the network. In addition, there is ample 
          scope of power management since printers and imaging systems are not used that often. 
          IEEE-ISTO Printer working group has defined MIB modules for monitoring the power consumption 
          and power state series that can be useful for power management of printers. The energy management 
          framework should also take into account the standards defined in the Printer working group. 
          In terms of other standards, IETF Printer MIB <xref target="RFC3805">RFC3805</xref> has been 
          standardized, however, this MIB module does not address power management of printers. </t>
