Internet-Draft           Port Range IPCP Options                May 2011


1.  Introduction

   Within the context of IPv4 address depletion, several solutions have
   been investigated to share IPv4 addresses.  Two flavors can be
   distinguished: NAT-based solutions (a.k.a., Carrier Grade NAT (CGN,
   [I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements])) or port range based ones (e.g.,
   [I-D.ymbk-aplusp]).  Port range-based solutions do not require an
   additional NAT level in the service provider's domain.  Several means
   may be used to convey Port Range information.

   This document defines the notion of Port Mask which is generic and
   flexible.  Several allocation schemes may be implemented when using a
   Port Mask.  It proposes a basic mechanism that allows the allocation
   of a unique port range to a requesting client.  This document defines
   Huawei IPCP options to be used to carry Port Range information.

   IPv4 address exhaustion is only provided as an example of the usage
   of the PPP IPCP Options defined in this document.  In particular,
   Port Range Options may be used independently of the presence of IP-
   Address IPCP Option.

   This document adheres to the consideration defined in [RFC2153].

1.1.  Use Cases

   Port Range Options can be used in port range-based solutions (e.g.,
   [I-D.ymbk-aplusp]) or in a CGN-based solution to bypass the NAT
   (i.e., for transparent NAT traversal and avoid involving several NAT
   levels in the path) or to delegate one or a set of ports to the
   requesting client (e.g., avoid ALG (Application Level Gateway) or for
   port forwarding).

   For improved security an option for delegating cryptographically
   random port range is defined.

1.2.  Terminology

   To differentiate between a Port Range containing a contiguous span of
   port numbers and a Port Range with non contiguous and possibly random
   port numbers, the following denominations are used:

   o  Contiguous Port Range: a set of port values which form a
      contiguous sequence.

   o  Non Contiguous Port Range: a set of port values which does not
      form a contiguous sequence.

Internet-Draft           Port Range IPCP Options                May 2011


   o  Random Port Range: a cryptographically random set of port values.

   Unless explicitly mentioned, Port Mask refers to the couple (Port
   Range Value, Port Range Mask).

   In addition, this document makes use of the following terms:

   o  Delegated port or port range: a port or a range of ports belonging
      to an IP address managed by an upstream device (such as NAT),
      which are delegated to a client for use as source address and port
      when sending packets.

   o  Forwarded port or port range: a port or a range of ports belonging
      to an IP address managed by an upstream device such as (NAT),
      which is/are statically mapped to the internal IP address of the
      client and same port number of the client.

   This memo uses the same terminology as per [RFC1661].


2.  Port Range Options

   This section defines the IPCP Option for Port Range delegation.  The
   format of vendor-specific options is defined in [RFC2153].  Below are
   provided the values to be conveyed when the Port Range Option is
   used:

   o  Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI): This field is set to
      781DBA (hex).

   o  Kind: This field is set to F0 (hex).

   o  Value: The content of this field is specified in Section 2.1 and
      Section 2.2.

2.1.  Description of Port Range Value and Port Range Mask

   The Port Range Value and Port Range Mask are used to specify one
   range of ports (contiguous or not contiguous) pertaining to a given
   IP address.  Concretely, Port Range Mask and Port Range Value are
   used to notify a remote peer about the Port Mask to be applied when
   selecting a port value as a source port.  The Port Range Value is
   used to infer a set of allowed port values.  A Port Range Mask
   defines a set of ports that all have in common a subset of pre-
   positioned bits.  This set of ports is also called Port Range.  Two
   port numbers are said to belong to the same Port Range if and only
   if, they have the same Port Range Mask.

Internet-Draft           Port Range IPCP Options                May 2011


   A Port Mask is composed of a Port Range Value and a Port Range Mask:

   o  The Port Range Value indicates the value of the significant bits
      of the Port Mask.  The Port Range Value is coded as follows:

      *  The significant bits may take a value of 0 or 1.

      *  All the other bits (a.k.a., non significant ones) are set to 0.

   o  The Port Range Mask indicates, by the bit(s) set to 1, the
      position of the significant bits of the Port Range Value.

   This IPCP Configuration Option provides a way to negotiate the Port
   Range to be used on the local end of the link.  It allows the sender
   of the Configure-Request message to state which Port Range associated
   with a given IP address is desired, or to request the peer to provide
   the configuration.  The peer can provide this information by NAKing
   the option, and returning a valid Port Range (i.e., (Port Range
   Value, Port Range Mask)).

   When a peer issues a request enclosing IPCP Port Range Option, and if
   the server does not support this option, the Port Range Option is
   rejected by the server.

   The Port Range IPCP option adheres to the format defined in Section
   1.1 of [RFC2153].  The "value" field of the option defined in
   [RFC2153] when conveying Port Range IPCP Option is provided in
   Figure 1.

      for.  A value of zero indicates the port ranges are delegated,
      while a value of 1 indicates the port ranges are port forwarded.

   o  Port Range Value (PRV): PRV indicates the value of the significant
      bits of the Port Mask.  By default, no PRV is assigned.

   o  Port Range Mask (PRM): Port Range Mask indicates the position of
      the bits which are used to build the Port Range Value.  By
      default, no PRM value is assigned.  The 1 values in the Port Range
      Mask indicate by their position the significant bits of the Port
      Range Value.

   Figure 2 provides an example of the resulting Port Range:

   - Port Range Mask is set to 0001010000000000 (5120) and

   - Port Range Value is set to 0000010000000000 (1024).

   Port values belonging to this Port Range must have the 4th bit (resp.
   the sixth one), from the left, set to 0 (resp. 1).  Only these port
   values will be used by the peer when enforcing the configuration
   conveyed by PPP IPCP.

2.2.  Description of Cryptographically Random Port Range option

   A cryptographically random Port Range Option may be used as a
   mitigation tool against blind attacks described in [RFC6056].

   The benefits of the approach and the method to calculate the
   delegated ports set are described in [I-D.bajko-pripaddrassign].

   The cryptographically Random Port Range IPCP Option adheres to the
   format defined in Section 1.1 of [RFC2153].  The "value" field of the
   option defined in [RFC2153] when conveying cryptographically Random
   Port Range IPCP Option is illustrated in Figure 3

   o  M: mode bit.  It indicates the mode the port range is allocated
      for.  A value of zero indicates the port ranges are delegated,
      while a value of 1 indicates the port ranges are port forwarded.

   o  Function: A 16 bit field whose value is associated with predefined
      encryption functions.  This specification associates value 1 with
      the predefined function described in Section 5 of
      [I-D.bajko-pripaddrassign].

   o  Starting Point: A 16 bit value used as an input to the specified
      function

   o  Number of delegated ports: A 16 bit value specifying the number of
      ports delegated to the client for use as source port values.

   o  Key K: A 128 bit key used as input to the predefined function for
      delegated port calculation.

   When the option is included in the IPCP Configure-Request 'key field'
   and 'starting point' field SHALL be set to all zeros.  The requester
   MAY indicate in the 'function' field which encryption function
   requester prefers, and in the 'number of delegated ports' field the
   number of ports the requester would like to obtain.  If requester has
   no preference it SHALL set also the 'function' field and/or 'number
   of delegated ports' field to zero.

   The usage of the option in IPCP message negotiation (Request/Reject/
   Nak/Ack) follows the logic described for Port Mask and Port Range
   options at section 2.3.

2.3.  Illustration Examples

2.3.1.  Overview

   These flows provide examples of the usage of IPCP to convey the Port
   Range Option.  As illustrated in Figure 4, IPCP messages are
   exchanged between a Host and a BRAS (Broadband Access Server).

   1.  The first example illustrates a successful IPCP exchange;

   2.  The second example shows the IPCP exchange that occurs when Port
       Range Option is not supported by the server;

   3.  The third example shows the IPCP exchange that occurs when Port
       Range Option is not supported by the client;

   4.  The fourth example shows the IPCP exchange that occurs when Port
       Range Option is not supported by the client and a non null IP
       (i.e., an address different from 0.0.0.0) address is enclosed in
       the first configuration request issued by the peer.

2.3.2.  Successful Flow: Port Range Options supported by both the Client
        and the Server

   The following message exchange (i.e., Figure 4) provides an example
   of successful IPCP configuration operation when the Port Range IPCP
   Option is used.

                         Figure 4: Successful flow

   The main steps of this flow are listed below:

      (1) The Host sends a first Configure-Request which includes the
      set of options it desires to negotiate.  All these Configuration
      Options are negotiated simultaneously.  In this example,
      Configure-Request carries information about IP-address, Port Range
      Value and Port Range Mask.  In this example, IP-address Option is
      set to 0.0.0.0, Port Range Value is set to 0 and Port Range Mask
      is set to 0.

      (2) BRAS sends back a Configure-Nak and sets the enclosed options
      to its preferred values.  In this example: IP-Address Option is
      set to a.b.c.d, Port Range Value is set to 80 and Port Range Mask
      is set to 496.

      (3) The Host re-sends a Configure-Request requesting IP-address
      Option to be set to a.b.c.d, Port Range Value to be set to 80 and
      Port Range Mask to be set to 496.

      (4) BRAS sends a Configure-Ack message

   As a result of this exchange, Host is configured to use as local IP
   address a.b.c.d and the following 128 contiguous Port Ranges
   resulting of the Port Mask (Port Range Value == 0, Port Range Mask ==
   496):

      - from 80 to 95

      - from 592 to 607

      - ...

      - from 65104 to 65119

2.3.3.  Port Range Option Not Supported by the Server

   does not support IPCP Port Range Option.

   Figure 5: Failed flow: Port Range Option not supported by the server

   The main steps of this flow are listed hereafter:

      (1) The Host sends a first Configure-Request which includes the
      set of options it desires to negotiate.  All these Configuration
      Options are negotiated simultaneously.  In this example,
      Configure-Request carries the codes of IP-address, Port Range
      Value and Port Range Mask options.  In this example, IP-address
      Option is set to 0.0.0.0, Port Range Value is set to 0 and Port
      Range Mask is set to 0.

      (2) BRAS sends back a Configure-Reject to decline Port Range
      option.

      (3) The Host sends a Configure-Request which includes only the
      codes of IP-Address option.  In this example, IP-Address Option is
      set to 0.0.0.0.

      (4) BRAS sends back a Configure-Nak and sets the enclosed option
      to its preferred value.  In this example: IP-Address Option is set
      to a.b.c.d.

      (5) The Host re-sends a Configure-Request requesting IP-Address
      Option to be set to a.b.c.d.

      (6) BRAS sends a Configure-Ack message.

   As a result of this exchange, Host is configured to use as local IP
   address a.b.c.d.  This IP address is not a shared IP address.

2.3.4.  Port Range Option not Supported by the Client

   This example (Figure 6) depicts exchanges when only shared IP
   addresses are assigned to end-user's devices.  The server is
   configured to assign only shared IP addresses.  If Port Range Options
   are not enclosed in the configuration request, the request is
   rejected and the requesting peer will be unable to access the service
   as depicted in Figure 6.

          Figure 6: Port Range Option not supported by the Client

   The main steps of this flow are:

      (1) The Host sends a Configure-Request requesting IP-Address
      Option to be set to 0.0.0.0 and without enclosing the Port Range
      Option.

      (2) BRAS sends a Protocol-Reject message.

   As a result of this exchange, Host is not able to access the service.


3.  IANA Considerations

   No action is required from IANA since this document adheres to
   [RFC2153].


4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security issue in addition to
   those related to PPP.  Service providers should use authentication
   mechanisms such as CHAP [RFC1994] or PPP link encryption [RFC1968].

   Use of small and non-random port range may increase host exposure to
   attacks described [RFC6056].  This risk can be reduced by using
   larger port range or by using Random Port Range Option.
