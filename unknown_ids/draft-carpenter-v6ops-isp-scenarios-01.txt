Internet-Draft             ISP IPv6 Scenarios              February 2010


1.  Introduction

   As is well known, the approaching exhaustion of IPv4 address space
   will bring about a situation in which Internet Service Providers
   (ISPs) are faced with a choice between one or more of three major
   alternatives:
   1.  Squeeze the use of IPv4 addresses even harder than today, using
       smaller and smaller address blocks per customer, and possibly
       trading address blocks with other ISPs.
   2.  Install multiple layers of network address translation, or share
       IPv4 addresses by other methods such as address-plus-port mapping
       [I-D.ymbk-aplusp], [I-D.boucadair-port-range].
   3.  Deploy IPv6, and operate IPv4-IPv6 coexistence and interworking
       mechanisms.
   This document focuses on alternative (3), while recognizing that many
   ISPs may be obliged by circumstances to prolong the life of IPv4 by
   using (1) or (2) while preparing for (3).

   The document is intended as a guide to useful IPv6 deployment
   scenarios.  However, it is not a "cookbook" of operational recipes,
   and the best choice of scenarios will depend on the circumstances of
   individual ISPs.

   We consider various aspects of IPv6 deployment: addressing, routing,
   DNS, management and of course IPv4-IPv6 coexistence and interworking.
   We do not consider application services in detail, but we do discuss
   general aspects.

   We first review several documents produced in the past by the IETF,
   and mention relevant work in progress in the IETF.  We then survey
   requirements, plans, and practical experience from various ISPs.
   Several deployment scenarios that result from that input are then
   described; these are not formal recommendations, but are intended as
   example scenarios which ISPs may choose to copy or modify to suit
   their own technical, economic and regulatory situation.  We conclude
   with a gap analysis and security considerations.


2.  Review of existing documents

   The IETF's view of core IPv6 requirements is to be found in [RFC4294]
   (currently being updated as [I-D.ietf-6man-node-req-bis]).  However,
   this does not give a complete view of mechanisms an ISP may need to
   deploy, since it considers the requirements for an individual node,
   not for a network as a whole.

   [RFC4029] discusses scenarios for introducing IPv6 into ISP networks,
   as the problem was viewed some years ago.  The document is still



Carpenter & Jiang        Expires August 27, 2010                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             ISP IPv6 Scenarios              February 2010


   valuable as a general introduction to the process that an ISP must
   design, but it does not consider today's situation where IPv4
   addresses have in practical terms run out, and interworking between
   IPv6-only and IPv4-only clients and servers must be supported in
   addition to basic dual-stack and tunneling scenarios.  We can extract
   a list of basic issues and needs from RFC 4029, using the RFC's own
   terminology:
   o  Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) - must support IPv6, or allow
      IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels.  CPE requirements and security are currently
      being specified in [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router] and
      [I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-simple-security].
   o  Provider Edge Equipment (PE) - ditto.
   o  ISP backbone (core and border routers, switches if used) - support
      dual stack, or allow IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels.  An alternative is a
      newly built IPv6 backbone that allows IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnels.
   o  Network management and monitoring applications must take IPv6 into
      account.
   o  Customer management (e.g., RADIUS) mechanisms must be able to
      supply IPv6 prefixes and other information to customers.
   o  Accounting and billing mechanisms must support both versions.
   o  Security mechanisms must support both versions.

   The end goal described in RFC 4029 is simply a dual-stack ISP
   backbone.  Today's view is that this is insufficient, as it does not
   allow for interworking between IPv6-only and legacy (IPv4-only)
   hosts.  Indeed, the end goal today might be an IPv6-only ISP
   backbone, with some form of legacy IPv4 support.

   [RFC4779] discusses deployment in broadband access networks such as
   CATV, ADSL and wireless.  [RFC5181] deals specifically with IEEE
   802.16 access networks.  In some access scenarios, the access
   protocol allows separately for IPv4 and IPv6, as for DOCSIS-based
   CATV and for one variant of IEEE 802.16 [RFC5121].  In other
   scenarios, the broadband service is essentially an emulation of raw
   Ethernet, as for Wi-Fi, or for another variant of IEEE 802.16
   [I-D.ietf-16ng-ip-over-ethernet-over-802-dot-16].  Another issue is
   whether the ISP uses MPLS for back-haul from the access network, in
   which case the 6PE [RFC4798] mechanism may be appropriate to carry
   IPv6, with no need to change the IGP in any way.

   [RFC4942] covers IPv6 security issues, especially those that are
   specific to transition and coexistence scenarios.  The main message
   for ISPs is that the switch to IPv6 does not mean that IP layer
   security issues will go away, and of course security issues that are
   not specific to the IP layer will hardly change.

   Also related to security, [RFC4864] discusses what is referred to as
   "Local Network Protection", i.e., how the internal structure of a



Carpenter & Jiang        Expires August 27, 2010                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             ISP IPv6 Scenarios              February 2010


   site network that is not hidden behind a network address translator
   can be protected.  Although not directly relevant to ISP operations,
   this topic does affect the issue of how well an ISP's customers are
   protected after they deploy IPv6.

   [RFC5211] describes an independent view of a possible sequence of
   events for IPv6 adoption in the Internet as a whole, with direct
   implications for ISPs.  Its main point, perhaps, is that by 2012 it
   will be necessary to regard IPv4 networks as the legacy solution.

   Although the basic IPv6 standards have long been stable, it should be
   noted that considerable work continues in the IETF, particularly to
   resolve the issue of highly scalable multihoming support for IPv6
   sites, and to resolve the problem of IP layer interworking between
   IPv6-only and IPv4-only hosts.  Progress continues in various IETF
   working groups that may affect ISP scenarios in due course.
   o  The 6MAN WG maintains the basic IPv6 standards.  This work should
      have little direct effect on ISPs.
   o  The V6OPS WG produces documents of direct interest for operational
      practice as well as security practice.  Current work includes CPE
      requirements, CPE security, and Internet Exchange Point practice.
      The present document will be discussed in V6OPS.
   o  The SOFTWIRE WG is working on additional protocols for IP-in-IP
      tunnels in an ISP context.
   o  The BEHAVE WG is working on specifications for NAT64 and DNS64,
      methods of supporting access from IPv6-only initiators to reach
      IPv4-only services.
   o  The DHC WG maintains and extends DHCPv6.
   o  The SHIM6 WG is finalising work on a host-based protocol for IPv6
      multihoming, based on the usage of multiple IPv6 prefixes for a
      customer connected to multiple ISPs.
   o  The LISP WG is developing experimental standards for a scalable
      tunnel-based routing mechanism which would, if successful, support
      an alternative multihoming model.

   Readers may find the current documents of these WGs via
   <http://www.ietf.org/dyn/wg/charter.html>.

   The IETF is not currently discussing IPv6/IPv4 interworking at the
   transport or application layers.  The former is not generally
   considered to be a valuable approach.  The latter is considered to be
   handled within the original dual-stack model of IPv6 deployment:
   either one end of an application session will have dual-stack
   connectivity, or a dual-stack intermediary such as an HTTP proxy or
   SMTP server will interface to both IPv4-only and IPv6-only hosts.
   While valid and useful for many common applications, this approach
   does not solve all possible interworking issues.  In any case it does
   not require further standards work at the network layer.

3.  Review of ISP experience, plans and requirements

   To obtain a view of the IPv6 experience, plans and requirements of
   ISPs, a questionnaire was issued in December 2009 and announced
   widely to the operational community.  We promised to keep the replies
   strictly confidential and to publish only combined results, without
   identifying information about individual ISPs in any published
   results.  The raw technical questions are shown in Appendix B, and a
   detailed summary of the replies is in Appendix A.  Note that although
   the questionnaire was widely announced, those who chose to reply were
   self-selected and we can make no claim of statistical significance or
   freedom from bias in the results.  In particular, we assume that ISPs
   with a pre-existing interest in IPv6 are more likely to have replied
   than others.

   Thirty ISPs replied before the cutoff date for this analysis.
   (Additional replies, if received by the end of April 2010, will be
   included in a later version.) 66% of responses were from European
   ISPs but large operators in North America and Asia/Pacific regions
   are included.  Commercial ISPs operating nationally predominate, with
   a vast range of size (from 30 customers up to 40 million).  Note that
   some very large providers chose not to answer about the number of
   customers.

   80% of the respondents offer both transit and origin-only service;
   27% offer IP multicast service; 80% have multihomed customers.  A
   very wide variety of access technologies is used: xDSL, DOCSIS,
   leased line (X.25, TDM/PDH, SDH), frame relay, dialup, microwave,
   FTTP, CDMA, UMTS, LTE, WiMAX, BWA, WiFi, Ethernet (100M-10G),
   MetroEthernet/MPLS.  Most ISPs provide CPE to some or all of their
   customers, but these CPE are often unable to support IPv6.

   Estimates of when ISPs will run out of public IPv4 address space for
   internal use vary widely, between "now" and "never".  Public IPv4
   address space for customers is mainly expected to run out between
   2010 and 2015, but three or four ISPs suggested it will never happen.
   About 20% of ISPs offer RFC 1918 space to customers, and about 40%
   use such addresses internally.

   60% of ISPs report that some big customers are requesting IPv6.
   Predictions for when 10% of customers will require IPv6 range from
   2010 to 2017, and for 50% from 2011 to 2020.  These ISPs require IPv6
   to be a standard service by 2010 to 2015; the most common target date
   is 2011. 40% already offer IPv6 as a regular service, although in
   general it is used by fewer than 1% of customers.  Another 47% of
   ISPs have IPv6 deployment in progress or planned.  These all plan at
   least beta-test service in 2010.  Planned dates for regular service
   are between 2010 and 2013 (except for one ISP who replied that it

   depends on the marketing department).  When asked when IPv6 will
   reach 50% of total traffic, the most common answer is 2015.

   Turning to technology choices, the overwhelming choice of approach
   (93%) is a dual stack routing backbone, and the reason given is
   simplicity and cost. 40% run, or plan to run, a 6to4 relay as well,
   and 17% run or plan a Teredo server.  However, 77% of ISPs don't have
   or plan any devices dedicated to IPv6.  A different 77% don't see
   IPv6 as an opportunity to restructure their network topology.

   When asked which types of equipment are unable to support IPv6, the
   most common answer was CPE (9 mentions).  Also mentioned: handsets;
   DSLAMs; routers (including several specific models); traffic
   management boxes; load balancers; VPN boxes; management interfaces &
   systems; firewalls; billing systems.  When asked if such devices can
   be field-upgraded, the answers were gloomy: 5 yes, 4 partially, 10
   no, and numerous "don't know" or "hopefully".

   83% support or plan DNS AAAA queries over IPv6, and all but one of
   these include reverse DNS lookup for IPv6.

   The ISPs have prefixes ranging from /19 to /48, and have a variety of
   policies for customer prefixes.  Fifteen ISPs offer more than one of
   /48, /52, /56, /60 or /64.  Two offer /56 only, seven offer /48 only.
   Two wired operators offer /64 only.  Mobile operators offer /64 in
   accordance with 3GPP, but at least one would like to be allowed to
   offer /128 or /126.  Also, as many as 30% of the operators already
   have IPv6 customers preferring a PI prefix.  The methods chosen for
   prefix delegation to CPEs are manual, DHCPv6[-PD], SLAAC, RADIUS, and
   PPoE.

   About 50% of ISPs already operate or plan dual-stack SMTP, POP3, IMAP
   and HTTP services.  In terms of internal services, it seems that
   firewalls, intrusion detection, address management, monitoring, and
   network management tools are also around the 50% mark.  However,
   accounting and billing software is only ready at 23% of ISPs.

   Considering IPv4-IPv6 interworking, 57% of ISPs don't expect to have
   IPv6-only customers (but mobile operators are certain they will have
   millions).  Five ISPs report customers who explicitly refused to
   consider IPv6.  When asked how long customers will run IPv4-only
   applications, the most frequent answer is "more than ten years".
   Only three ISPs state that IPv6-IPv4 interworking at the the IP layer
   is not needed.  On the other hand, only three (a different three!)
   run or plan to run NAT-PT.  At least 30% plan to run some kind of
   translator (presumably NAT64/DNS64), but only one felt that a
   multicast translator was essential.  Among those who do not plan a
   translator, when asked how they plan to connect IPv6-only customers

   to IPv4-only services, seven rely on dual stack and three have no
   plan (one said, paraphrasing, "it's their problem").

   Asked about plans for Mobile IPv6 (or Nemo mobile networks), 20% said
   yes, and 70% said no, with the others uncertain.


4.  Lessons from experience and planning

   This section is assembled and paraphrased from general comments made
   in the various questionnaire responses.  Any inconsistencies or
   contradictions are present in the original data.  Comments related to
   missing features and products have been included in Section 6.

   As noted in the summary above, the ISPs that responded largely prefer
   a native dual stack deployment.  Numerous comments mentioned the
   simplicity of this model and the complexity and sub-optimal routing
   of tunnel-based solutions.  Topology redesign is not considered,
   because congruent IPv4 and IPv6 topology simplifies maintenance and
   engineering.  Nevertheless, 6to4 is considered convenient for DOCSIS
   users and 6RD is considered an attractive model by some.  Various
   operators, but by no means all, see a need for 6to4 and Teredo.  One
   MPLS-based operator prefers 6PE because it avoids an IPv6 IGP and
   reduces operational costs.  Another operator sees IPv4 scarcity
   addressed by a DS-lite CGN, also acting as a catalyst for IPv6.  One
   operator with a very large NAT44 infrastructure believes that NAT64
   will be similar to support.

   Several ISPs observe that IPv6 deployment is technically not hard.
   The most eloquent statement: "Just do it, bit by bit.  It is very
   much an 'eating the elephant' problem, but at one mouthful at a time,
   it appears to be surprisingly easy."  Despite the known gaps, the
   tools and toolkits are fairly mature at this point.  Managerial
   commitment and a systematic approach to analysing requirements and
   readiness are of course essential.  Evangelization remains a must, as
   it seems that many ISP and IT managers are still unaware of the need
   for an IPv6 plan, and are inclined to dismiss IPv4 depletion as a
   false alarm, and also seem unaware that NATs create expensive support
   requirements.  Without customers wanting IPv6, getting business
   backing is very hard, and IPv6 security and scale was not a focus for
   vendors until very recently.  Also, operators lack real experience
   with customer usage of IPv6, and the resulting lack of confidence
   causes delay.

   Three further quotations are of interest:

   "We are planning to move all our management addressing from IPv4 to
   IPv6 to free up IPv4 addresses."

Internet-Draft             ISP IPv6 Scenarios              February 2010


   "I am actively pushing our larger customers to start testing IPv6 as
   our development has pretty much stopped as we need some real world
   testing to be done."

   "Customer support needs to be aware that IPv6 is being started in
   your network, or servers.  We experienced many IPv6 blocking
   applications, applications that do not fall back to IPv4, etc.  The
   most difficult part may be to get engineers, sales, customer support
   personnel to like IPv6."


5.  Suggested scenarios

   This document does not make firm recommendations; the circumstances
   of each ISP may be different.  Rather, it describes several suggested
   deployment scenarios that appear, from the analysis above, to have
   the best operational characteristics.  Each ISP should make its own
   choices, according to its own technical, economic and regulatory
   environment.

   [[ NOTE: this section will be filled out after further discussions.
   It will also discuss changes since the older analyses discussed in
   Section 2 ]]


6.  Gap analysis

   The analysis has shown a certain number of desirable features to be
   missing, either in relevant specifications, or in many products.
   This section summarizes those gaps.

   As noted above, numerous models of various types of product still do
   not support IPv6:
      CPE
      handsets
      DSLAMs
      routers
      traffic management boxes
      load balancers
      VPN boxes
      other appliances
      management interfaces and systems
      firewalls
      accounting and billing systems

   It is not the purpose of this document to name and shame vendors, but
   it is today becoming urgent for all such products to avoid becoming
   part of the IPv4 legacy.  ISPs want consistent feature-equal support



Carpenter & Jiang        Expires August 27, 2010                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             ISP IPv6 Scenarios              February 2010


   for IPv4 and IPv6 in all equipment and software at reasonable or no
   extra cost.  The problems can be quite subtle: for example, one CPE
   with "full" IPv6 support does not support IPv6 traffic shaping, so
   the ISP cannot cap IPv6 traffic to contractual limits.  Other needs
   and issues mentioned:
   o  A specific CPE need is an intelligent prefix sub-delegation
      mechanism (ease of use issue).
   o  Full RA support on LAN side of ADSL CPE.
   o  PPPoE and RADIUS support.  Specifically, global unicast address
      assignment for L2TP/PPPoE.  Currently the PPPoE client will be
      assigned a link-local address, requiring a second step (DHCPv6 or
      SLAAC).
   o  Simple automatic distribution of DNS server details is essential;
      RFC 5006 support is needed (DNS server option in RA).
   o  ISPs need fully featured DHCPv6, especially since SLAAC does not
      allow settings to be pushed out (except for RFC 5006).
   o  Firewall systems should not use separate IPv4 and IPv6 rules.
   o  Customer side firewalls/routers which can do 25-100 Mbit/s.
   o  Gaps in infrastructure security for IPv6 management.
   o  Gaps in routers' treatment of header options.
   o  RA-Guard in switches.
   o  VRRP support.
   o  PE-CE routing protocols (OSPF and IS-IS).
   o  Problems using a single BGP session to exchange routes for both
      IPv4 and IPv6.
   o  IPv6 support in all the best open source tools.

   Several ISPs also noted that much commercial applications software
   does not correctly support IPv6 and that this will cause customer
   problems.  Also, some operating systems are still shipped with IPv6
   disabled by default, or with features such as IPv4-mapped addresses
   disabled by default.

   Numerous ISPs clearly want a scaleable NAT64/DNS64 product.  Other
   protocol-related needs are:
   o  Getting it right so that a dual stack client doesn't end up trying
      to use the wrong transport to reach a site.
   o  User-side port allocation mechanisms.  UPnP IGD and NAT-PMP can be
      used for IPv4, but nothing exists for IPv6 (yet).  [Editor's
      question: since there is no address shortage or port mapping for
      IPv6, why is this an issue except in a v4-over-v6 scenarios such
      as DS-lite?]

   Global IPv6 connectivity still has issues; for example ISPs in the
   Pacific region may have to obtain IPv6 transit via the USA (a
   situation faced by IPv4 operators in Europe about twenty years ago).
   Also, there are persistent PMTUD issues in various places on the net,

   o  (Note that these numbers include answers that apply to tens of
      millions of mobile handsets.)

   IPv4 Address Space:
   o  When do you expect to run out of public IPv4 address space inside
      your own network?  Estimates run from "now" to 2020, but 4 ISPs
      say "never" or "unforeseeable".

Internet-Draft             ISP IPv6 Scenarios              February 2010


   o  Do you currently offer IPv6 as a regular service? 12 yes, 5
      partial, 12 no
   o  What % of customers currently use IPv6? <1% to 30%; mostly 0 or
      <1%
   o  When do you plan to start IPv6 deployment? 11 complete, 12 in
      progress, 3 in plan, 4 have no plan
   o  When do you plan to offer IPv6 as a special or beta-test service?
      For all those in progress or with a plan, the answer was either
      "now" or during 2010.
   o  When do you plan to offer IPv6 as a regular service to all
      customers?  For all those in progress or with a plan, the answer
      was between "now" and 2013 (except for one ISP who replied that it
      depends on the marketing department).

   IPv6 Technologies.  Note the answers refer to actual deployment or to
   plans, as the case may be:
   o  Which basic IPv6 access method(s) apply?

         respondents mentioned that they are getting their own transit
         connectivity via static tunnels.
      *  Something else: Answers were 6VPE + NAT64/DNS64; PNAT;
         "considering 6RD"
   o  Please briefly explain the main reasons/issues behind your choice:
      The best summary of the answers is "dual stack is simplest, why do
      anything else?".
   o  Which types of equipment in your network are unable to support
      IPv6?  The most common answer was CPE (9 mentions).  Also
      mentioned: handsets; DSLAMs; routers (including several specific
      models); traffic management boxes; load balancers; VPN boxes;
      management interfaces & systems; firewalls; billing systems.

      5 partial, 23 no
   o  Do you include support for DNS AAAA queries over IPv6? 20 yes, 5
      plan, 4 no
   o  Do you include support for reverse DNS for IPv6 addresses? 21 yes,
      3 plan, 5 no

         "their problem")
      *  If you offer IP multicast, will that need to be translated too?
         1 yes, 2 uncertain, 5 no
