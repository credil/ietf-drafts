Abstract 
    
   Record Route is a useful administrative tool that has been used  
   extensively by the service providers. However, when TE links are 
   bundled, identification of label resource in Record Route Object 
   (RRO) is not enough for the administrative purpose. Network service

        Component Link Record. & Resource Control for TE Link Bundles  
 
 
   providers would like to know the component link within a TE link that 
   is being used by a given LSP. In other words, when link bundling is 
   used, resource recording requires mechanisms to specify the component 
   link identifier, along with the TE link identifier and Label. As it 
   is not possible to record component link in the RRO, this draft 
   defines the extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] to specify 
   component link identifiers for resource recording purposes.   
        
   This draft also defines the Explicit Route Object (ERO) counterpart 
   of the RRO extension. The ERO extensions are needed to perform 
   explicit label/ resource control over bundled TE link. Hence, this 
   document defines the extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] to 
   specify component link identifiers for explicit resource control and 
   recording over TE link bundles.

        Component Link Record. & Resource Control for TE Link Bundles  
 
 
1. Terminology  
                       
   TE Link: Unless specified otherwise, it refers to a bundled Traffic  
   Engineering link as defined in [RFC4201]. Furthermore, the terms TE  
   Link and bundled TE Link are used interchangeably in this draft.   
        
   Component  (interface) link: refers (locally) to a component link as  
   part of a bundled TE link. A component link is numbered/ unnumbered  
   in its own right. For unnumbered component links, the component link  
   ID is assumed to be unique on an advertising node. For numbered  
   component links, the component link ID is assumed to be unique within  
   a domain.   
        
   Component Interface Identifier: Refers to an ID used to uniquely  
   identify a Component Interface. On a bundled link a combination of  
   <component link identifier, label> is sufficient to unambiguously  
   identify the appropriate resources used by an LSP [RFC4201]. 
    
2. Introduction   
     
   In GMPLS networks [RFC3945] that deals with unbundled (being either 
   PSC, L2SC, TDM or LSC) TE Links, one of the types of resources that 
   an LSP originator can control and would like to record are the TE 
   Link interfaces used by the LSP. The resource control and recording 
   is done by the use of an explicit route, i.e., Explicit Route (ERO)  
   Object and record Route, i.e., Record Route Object (RRO) object, 
   respectively.   
        
   Link Bundling, introduced in [RFC4201], is used to improve routing 
   scalability by reducing the amount of TE related information that 
   needs to be flooded and handled by IGP in a TE network. This is 
   accomplished by aggregating and abstracting the TE Link resource. In  
   some cases the complete resource identification is left as a local 
   decision. However, as described above there are cases when it is 
   desirable for a non-local (e.g., LSP head-end) node to identify 
   completely or partially the LSP resources. In either case, and for 
   administrative reasons, it is required to know which component link 
   within a bundled TE link has been used for a given LSP.    
           
   When link bundling is used to aggregate multiple component links into 
   a TE link, label is not the only resource that needs to be identified 
   and recorded. In other words, the TE Link and the Label specified in 
   the ERO/ RRO objects are not enough to completely identify the 
   resource. For the bundled TE link case, in order to fully specify the 
   resources on a link for a given LSP, the component link needs to be 
   specified along with the label. In the case of bi-directional LSPs 
   both upstream and downstream information may be specified. Therefore, 
   explicit resource control and recording over a bundled TE link also 
   requires ability to specify a component link within the TE link.

        Component Link Record. & Resource Control for TE Link Bundles  
 
 
         
   This draft defines extensions to and describes the use of RSVP-TE  
   [RFC3209], [RFC3471], [RFC3473] to specify the component link 
   identifier for resource recording and explicit resource control over  
   TE link bundles. Specifically, in this document, component interface 
   identifier RRO and ERO subobjects are defined to complement their 
   Label RRO and ERO counterparts. Furthermore, procedures for 
   processing component interface identifier RRO and ERO subobjects and 
   how they can co-exist with the Label RRO and ERO subobjects are 
   specified.  
    
3. LSP Resource Recording   
     
   LSP Resource Recording refers to the ability to record the resources 
   used by an LSP.  
    
   The procedure for unbundled numbered TE links is described in  
   [RFC3209] and for unbundled unnumbered TE links in [RFC3477]. For the 
   purpose of recording LSP resources used over bundled TE Links, the 
   Component Interface Identifier RRO sub-object is introduced.   
       
3.1 Component Interface Identifier RRO subobject  
         
   A new subobject of the Record Route Object (RRO) is used to record 
   component interface identifier of a (bundled) TE Link. This subobject 
   has the following format:   
             
    0                   1                   2                   3  
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
   |                                                               | 
   //   IPv4, IPv6 or unnumbered Component Interface Identifier   //  
   |                            . . .                              |

         The Length contains the total length of the subobject in  
         bytes, including the Type and Length fields. The Length is  
         8 bytes for the Component Interface identifier IPv4 and  
         Component Interface identifier Unnumbered types. For  
         Component Interface identifier IPv6 type of sub-object, the  
         length field is 20 bytes.  
                 
      U: 1 bit  
        
         This bit indicates the direction of the component  
         interface. It is 0 for the downstream interface. It is  
         set to 1 for the upstream interface and is only used for  
         bi-directional LSPs. 
    
3.2 Processing of Component Interface identifier RRO Subobject  
         
   If a node desires component link recording, the "Component Link  
   Recording desired" flag (value TBD) should be set in the  
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES object, object that is defined in [RFC5420].  
    
   Setting of "Component Link Recording desired" flag is independent of 
   the Label Recording flag in SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object as specified in  
   [RFC3209]. Nevertheless, the following combinations are valid:  
    
   1) If both Label and Component Link flags are clear, then neither  
      Labels nor Component Links are recorded.  
          
   2) If Label Recording flag is set and Component Link flag is  
      clear, then only Label Recording is performed as defined in  
      [RFC3209].  
          
   3) If Label Recording flag is clear and Component Link flag is  
      set, then Component Link Recording is performed as defined in this  
      proposal.  
          
   4) If both Label Recording and Component Link flags are set, then  
      Label Recording is performed as defined in [RFC3209] and also  
      Component Link recording is performed as defined in this proposal.  
        
   In most cases, a node initiates recording for a given LSP by adding 
   the RRO to the Path message. If the node desires Component Link 
   recording and if the outgoing TE link is bundled, then the initial 
   RRO contains the Component Link identifier (numbered or unnumbered) 
   as selected by the sender. As well, the Component Link Recording 
   desired flag is set in the LSP_ATTRIBUTE object. If the node also 
   desires label recording, it sets the Label_Recording flag in the 
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object.

        Component Link Record. & Resource Control for TE Link Bundles  
 
 
   When a Path message with the "Component Link Recording desired" flag 
   set is received by an intermediate node, if a new Path message is to 
   be sent for a downstream bundled TE link, the node adds a new 
   Component Link subobject to the RECORD_ROUTE object (RRO) and appends 
   the resulting RRO to the Path message before transmission.  
     
   Note also that, unlike Labels, Component Link identifiers are always 
   known on receipt of the Path message.  
        
   When the destination node of an RSVP session receives a Path message 
   with an RRO and the "Component Link Recording desired" flag set, this 
   indicates that the sender node needs TE route as well as component 
   link recording. The destination node initiates the RRO process by 
   adding an RRO to Resv messages. The processing mirrors that of the 
   Path messages  
        
   The Component Interface Record subobject is pushed onto the 
   RECORD_ROUTE object (RRO) prior to pushing on the node's IP address. 
   A node MUST NOT push on a Component Interface Record subobject 
   without also pushing on the IP address or unnumbered Interface Id 
   subobject that identifies the TE Link.  
        
   When component interfaces are recorded for bi-directional LSPs, 
   component interface RRO subobjects for both downstream and upstream 
   interfaces MUST be included. 
 
4. Signaling Component Interface Identifier in ERO  
        
   A new OPTIONAL subobject of the EXPLICIT_ROUTE Object (ERO) is used 
   to specify component interface identifier of a bundled TE Link.   
        
   This Component Interface Identifier subobject has the following 
   format:   
            
    0                   1                   2                   3  
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   //  IPv4, IPv6 or unnumbered Component Interface Identifier    //

         Type 12 (TBD): Component Interface identifier Unnumbered  
        
      Length  
        
         The Length contains the total length of the subobject in  
         bytes, including the Type and Length fields. The Length is  
         8 bytes for the Component Interface identifier types: IPv4  
         and Component Interface identifier Unnumbered. For Component 
         Interface identifier IPv6 type of sub-object, the length field 
         is 20 bytes.   
        
      U: 1 bit  
             
         This bit indicates the direction of the component interface.  
         It is 0 for the downstream interface. It is set to 1 for the 
         upstream interface and is only used for bi-directional LSPs.   
                      
4.1 Processing of Component Interface Identifier ERO Subobject  
           
   The Component Interface Identifier ERO subobject follows a subobject 
   containing the IP address, or the link identifier [RFC3477], 
   associated with the TE link on which it is to be used. It is used to 
   identify the component of a bundled TE Link.  
        
   The following SHOULD result in "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" error 
   being sent upstream by a node processing an ERO that contains the  
   Component Interface ID sub-object:  
        
   o) The first component interface identifier subobject is not  
      preceded by a sub-object containing an IPv4 or IPv6 address, or  
      an interface identifier [RFC3477], associated with a TE link.  
          
   o) The Component Interface Identifier ERO subobject follows a  
      subobject that has the L-bit set.  
    
   o) On unidirectional LSP setup, there is a Component Interface  
      Identifier ERO subobject with the U-bit set.  
          
   o) Two Component Interface Identifier ERO subobjects with the same  
      U-bit values exist.  
           
   If a node implements the component interface identifier subobject, it 
   MUST check if it represents a component interface in the bundled TE 
   Link specified in the preceding subobject that contains the IPv4/IPv6 
   address or interface identifier of the TE Link. If the content of the 
   component interface identifier subobject does not match a component

   interface in the TE link, a "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" error SHOULD 
   be reported as "Routing Problem" (error code 24).   
     
   If U-bit of the subobject being examined is cleared (0) and the 
   upstream interface specified in this subobject is acceptable, then 
   the value of the upstream component interface is translated locally 
   in the TLV of the IF_ID RSVP HOP object [RFC3471]. The local 
   decision normally used to select the upstream component link is 
   bypassed except for local translation into the outgoing interface 
   identifier from the received incoming remote interface identifier. If 
   this interface is not acceptable, a "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" error 
   SHOULD be reported as "Routing Problem" (error code 24).    
           
   If the U-bit of the subobject being examined is set (1), then the 
   value represents the component interface to be used for upstream 
   traffic associated with the bidirectional LSP. Again, if this 
   interface is not acceptable or if the request is not one for a 
   bidirectional LSP, then a "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" error SHOULD be 
   reported as "Routing Problem" (error code 24). Otherwise, the 
   component interface IP address/ identifier is copied into a TLV sub-
   object as part of the IF_ID RSVP_HOP object. The local decision 
   normally used to select the upstream component link is bypassed  
   except for local translation into the outgoing interface identifier 
   from the received incoming remote interface identifier.  
        
   The IF_ID RSVP_HOP object constructed as above MUST be included in 
   the corresponding outgoing Path message.   
        
   Note that, associated with a TE Link sub-object in the ERO, either 
   the (remote) upstream component interface or the (remote) downstream 
   component interface or both may be specified. As specified in 
   [RFC4201] there is no relationship between the TE Link type (numbered 
   or unnumbered) and the Link type of any one of its components.   
        
   The Component Interface Identifier ERO subobject is optional. 
   Similarly, presence of the Label ERO sub-objects is not mandatory  
   [RFC3471], [RFC3473]. Furthermore, component interface identifier 
   ERO subobject and Label ERO subobject may be included in the ERO  
   independently of each other. One of the following alternatives 
   applies:  
       
   o) When both sub-objects are absent, a node may select any  
      appropriate component link within the TE link and any label on the  
      selected component link.   
       
   o) When the Label subobject is only present for a bundled link, then  
      the selection of the component link within the bundle is a local  
      decision and the node may select any appropriate component link,  
      which can assume the label specified in the Label ERO.

        Component Link Record. & Resource Control for TE Link Bundles   
 
 
   o) When only the component interface identifier ERO subobject is  
      present, a node MUST select the component interface specified in  
      the ERO and may select any appropriate label value at the  
      specified component link.    
       
   o) When both component interface identifier ERO subobject and Label  
      ERO subobject are present, the node MUST select the locally  
      corresponding component link and the specified label value on that  
      component link. When present, both subobjects may appear in any  
      relative order to each other but they MUST appear after the TE  
      Link subobject that they refer to.  
        
   After processing, the component interface identifier subobjects are 
   removed from the ERO.  
        
   Inferred from above, the interface subobject should never be the 
   first subobject in a newly received message.  If the component 
   interface subobject is the first subobject in a received ERO, then it 
   SHOULD be treated as a "Bad strict node" error.  
        
   Note: Information to construct the Component Interface ERO subobject 
   may come from the same mean used to populate the label ERO subobject.  
   Procedures by which an LSR at the head-end of an LSP obtains the 
   information needed to construct the Component Interface subobject are 
   outside the scope of this document. 
    
5. Forward Compatibility Note  
     
   The extensions specified in this draft do not affect the processing 
   of the RRO, ERO at nodes that do not support them. A node that does 
   not support the Component Interface RRO subobject but that does 
   support Label subobject SHOULD only insert the Label subobject in the  
   RRO as per [RFC3471] and [RFC3473].   
        
   A node that receives an ERO that contains a Component Link ID 
   subobject SHOULD send "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" if it does not 
   implement this subobject.  
        
   Per [RFC3209], Section 4.4.5, a non-compliant node that receives an 
   RRO that contains Component Interface Identifier sub-objects should 
   ignore and pass them on. This limits the full applicability of if 
   nodes traversed by the LSP are compliant with the proposed 
   extensions.  
        
6. Security Considerations  
        
   This document does not introduce new security issues. The security 
   considerations pertaining to the original RSVP protocol [RFC2205] 
   remain relevant.

7. IANA Considerations  
        
   This document introduces the following RSVP protocol elements: 
    
   o) Component Interface Identifier RRO subobject of the Record Route    
      Object (RRO). The following Types are defined:  
        
         Type 10 (TBD): Component Interface identifier IPv4   
         Type 11 (TBD): Component Interface identifier IPv6  
         Type 12 (TBD): Component Interface identifier Unnumbered 
    
   o) Component Interface Identifier subobject of the Explicit Route  
      Object (ERO). The following Types are defined:  
        
         Type 10 (TBD): Component Interface identifier IPv4   
         Type 11 (TBD): Component Interface identifier IPv6  
         Type 12 (TBD): Component Interface identifier Unnumbered 
    
   o) A new "Component Link Recording desired" flag (value TBD)     
      of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object [RFC5420]
