                draft-arkko-homenet-prefix-assignment-00

Abstract

   This memo describes a prefix assignment mechanism for home networks.
   It is expected that home gateway routers are assigned an IPv6 prefix
   through DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (PD).  This prefix needs to be
   divided among the multiple subnets in a home network.  This memo
   describes a mechanism for such division via OSPFv3.  This is an
   alternative design to using DHCPv6 PD also for the prefix assignment.
   The memo is input to the working group so that it can make a decision
   on which type of design to pursue.  It is expected that a routing-
   protocol based assignment uses a minimal amount of prefixes.

1.  Introduction

   This memo describes a prefix assignment mechanism for home networks.
   It is expected that home gateway routers are assigned an IPv6 prefix
   through DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (PD) [RFC3633], or in some cases
   manually configured.  This prefix needs to be divided among the
   multiple subnets in a home network.  This memo describes a mechanism
   for such division via OSPFv3 [RFC5340].

   The OSPv3-based mechanism is an alternative design to using DHCPv6 PD
   also for the prefix assignment in the internal network.  This memo
   has been written so that the working group can make a decision on
   which type of design to pursue.  The main benefit of using a routing
   protocol to handle the prefix assignment is that it can provide a
   more efficient allocation mechanism than hierarchical assignment
   through DHCPv PD.  This may be important for home networks that get
   only a /60 allocation from their ISPs.

   The rest of this memo is organized as follows.  Section 2 defines the
   usual keywords, Section 3 explains the main requirements for prefix
   assignments, Section 4 describes how a home gateway router makes
   assignments when it itself has multiple subnets, and Section 5
   describes how the assignment can be performed in a distributed manner
   via OSPFv3 in the entire home network.  Finally, Section 6 explains
   what administrative interfaces are useful for advanced users that
   wish to manually interact with the mechanisms, Section 7 discusses
   the security aspects of the design, and Section 8 explains the
   necessary IANA actions.


2.  Requirements language

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "OPTIONAL",
   "RECOMMENDED", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC2119].


3.  Role of Prefix Assignment

   Given a prefix shorter than /64 for the entire home network, this
   prefix needs to be subdivided so that every subnet is given its own
   /64 prefix.  In many cases there will be just one subnet, the
   internal network interface attached to the router.  But it is also
   common to have two or more internal network interfaces with
   intentionally separate networks.  For instance, "private" and "guest"
   SSIDs are automatically configured in many current home network
   routers.  When all the network interfaces that require a prefix are
   attached to the same router, the prefix assignment problem is simple,

   and procedures outlined in Section 4 can be employed.

   In a more complex setting there are multiple routers in the internal
   network.  There are various possible reasons why this might be
   necessary [I-D.chown-homenet-arch].  For instance, networks that
   cannot be bridged together should be routed, speed differences
   between wired and wireless interfaces make the use of the same
   broadcast domain undesirable, or simply that router devices keep
   being added.  In any case, it then becomes necessary to assign
   prefixes across the entire network, and this assignment can no longer
   be done on a local basis as proposed in Section 4.  A distributed
   mechanism and a protocol is required.

   The key requirements for this distributed mechanism are as follows.

   o  The short prefix assigned to the home gateway router must be used
      to assign /64 prefixes on each subnet that requires one.

   o  The assignment mechanism should provide reasonable efficiency.  As
      a practical benchmark, some ISPs may employ /60 assignments to
      individual subscribers.  As a result, the assignment mechanism
      should avoid wasting too many prefixes so that this set of 16 /64
      prefixes does not run out in the foreseeable future for commonly
      occuring network configurations.

   o  In particular, the assignment of multiple prefixes to the same
      network from the same top-level prefix must be avoided.

         Example: When a home network consists of a home gateway router
         connected to another router which in turn is connected to
         hosts, a minimum of two /64 prefixes are required in the
         internal network: one between the two routers, and another one
         for the host-side interface on the second router.  But an
         ineffective assignment mechanism in the two routers might have
         both of them asking for an assignment for this shared
         interface.

   o  The assignments must be stable across reboots, power cycling,
      router software updates, and preferably, should be stable across
      simple network changes such as adding a new device on the stub
      network segments.  However, stability across more complex types of
      network reconfiguration events is not a requirement.

   In an even more complex setting there may be multiple home gateway
   routers and multiple connections to ISP(s).  These cases are
   analogous to the case of a single gateway router.  Each gateway will
   simply distribute the prefix it has, and participating routers
   throughout the network may assign themselves prefixes from several

   gateways.

   Similarly, it is also possible that it is necessary to assign both a
   global prefix delegated from the ISP and a local, Unique Local
   Address (ULA) prefix [RFC4193].  The mechanisms in this memo are
   applicable to both types of prefixes.  For ULA-based prefixes, it is
   necessary to elect one or more router as the generator of such
   prefixes, and have it perform the generation and employ the prefixes
   for local interfaces and the entire router network.  The generation
   of ULAs in this manner -- and indeed even the question of whether
   ULAs are needed -- is outside the scope of this memo, however.  We
   only note that if ULA prefixes are generated, then the mechanisms in
   this memo can be used to subdivide that prefix for the rest of the
   network.


4.  Router Behavior

   This section describes how a router assigns prefixes to its directly
   connected interfaces.  We assume that the router has prefix(es) that
   it can use for this allocation.  These prefix(es) can be manually
   configured, acquired through DHCPv6 PD from the ISP, or learned
   through the distributed prefix assignment protocols described in
   Section 5.  Each such prefix is called a usable prefix.  Parts of the
   usable prefix may already be assigned for some purpose; a coordinated
   allocation from the prefix is necessary before it can actually be
   assigned to an interface.

   Even if the assignment process is local, it still needs to follow the
   requirements from Section 3.  This is achieved through the following
   rules:

   o  The router MUST maintain a list of assigned prefixes on a per-
      interface basis.  The contents of this list consists of prefixes
      that the router itself has assigned to the interface, as well as
      prefixes assigned to the interface by other routers.  The latter
      are learned through the mechanisms described in Section 5, when
      they are used.

   o  Whenever the router finds a combination of an interface and usable
      prefix that is not used on the interface, it SHOULD make a new
      assignment.  That is, the router checks to see if there exists an
      interface and usable prefix such that there are no assigned
      prefixes within that interface that are more specific than the
      usable prefix.  In this situation the router makes an allocation
      from the usable prefix (if possible) and adds the allocation to
      the list of assigned prefixes on that interface.

   o  An allocation from a usable prefix MUST check for other
      allocations from the same usable prefix.  Allocations are made for
      individual /64 prefixes.  The choice of a /64 among multiple free
      ones MUST be made randomly or based on an algorithm that takes
      unique hardware characteristics of the router and the interface
      into account.  This helps avoid collisions when simultaneous
      allocations are made within a network.

   o  In order to provide a stable assignment, the router MUST store
      assignments affecting directly connected interfaces in non-
      volatile memory and attempt to re-use them in the future when
      possible.  At least the 5 most recent assignments SHOULD be
      stored.  Note that this applies to both its own assignments as
      well as assignments made by others.  This ensures that the same
      prefix assignments are made regardless of the order that different
      devices are brought up.  To avoid attacks on flash memory write
      cycles, assignments made by others SHOULD be recorded only after
      10 minutes have passed and the assignment is still valid.

   o  Re-using a memorized assignment is possible when there exists a
      usable prefix that is less specific than the prefix in the
      assignment (or it is the prefix itself in the assignment), and the
      prefix in the assignment can be allocated for that purpose.

   Once the router has assigned a prefix to an interface, it MUST act as
   a router as defined in [RFC4861] and advertise the prefix in Router
   Advertisements.  The lifetime of the prefix SHOULD be advertised as a
   reasonably long period, at least 48 hours or the lifetime of the
   assigned prefixes, whichever is smaller.  To support a variety of
   IPv6-only hosts in these networks, the router needs to ensure that
   sufficient DNS discovery mechanisms are enabled.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that both stateless DHCPv6 [RFC3736] and Router Advertisement options
   [RFC6106] are supported and turned on by default.  This requires,
   however, that a working DNS server is known and addressable via IPv6.
   The mechanism in [RFC3736] and [RFC3646] can be used for this.


5.  Prefix Assignment in OSPFv3

   This section describes how prefix assignment in a home network can be
   performed in a distributed manner via OSPFv3.  It is expected that
   the router already support the auto-configuration extensions defined
   in [I-D.acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig].

   An overview to OSPFv3-based prefix assignment is as follows.  OSPFv3
   routers that are capable of auto-configuration advertise OSPFv3 Auto-
   Configuration (AC) LSA [I-D.acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig] with
   suitable TLVs.  For prefix assignment, two TLVs are used.  The Usable

Internet-Draft              Homenet Prefixes                October 2011


   Prefix TLV (Section 5.1) advertises a usable prefix, usually the
   prefix that has been delegated to the home gateway router from the
   ISP through DHCPv6 PD.  These usable prefixes are necessary for
   running the algorithm in Section 4 for determining whether prefix
   assignments can and should be made.

   The Assigned Prefix TLV (Section 5.2) is used to communicate
   assignments that routers make out of the usable prefixes.

   An assignment can be made when the algorithm in Section 4 indicates
   that it can be made and no other router has claimed the same
   assignment.  The router emits an OSPFv3 advertisement with Assigned
   Prefix TLV included to let other devices know that the prefix is now
   in use.  Unfortunately, collisions are still possible, when the
   algorithms on different routers happen to choose the same free /64
   prefix or when more /64 prefixes are needed than there are available.
   This situation is detected through an advertisement where a different
   router claims the allocation of the same prefix.  In this situation
   the router with numerically lower OSPFv3 Router ID has to select
   another prefix.  See also [I-D.acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig] Section
   5.2.

5.1.  Usable Prefix TLV

   The Usable Prefix TLV is defined for the OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration
   (AC) LSA [I-D.acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig].  It will have type TBD-
   BY-IANA-1 and MUST be advertised in the LSID OSPFv3 AC LSA with an
   LSID of 0.  It MAY occur once or multiple times and the information
   from all TLV instances is retained.  The length of the TLV is
   variable.

   The contents of the TLV include a usable prefix (Prefix) and prefix
   length (PrefixLength).  PrefixLength is the length in bits of the
   prefix and is an 8-bit field.  The PrefixLength MUST be greater than
   or equal to 8 and less than or equal to 64.  The prefix describes an
   allocation of a global or ULA prefix for the entire auto-configured
   home network.  The Prefix is an encoding of the prefix itself as an
   even multiple of 32-bit words, padding with zero bits as necessary.
   This encoding consumes (PrefixLength + 31) / 32) 32-bit words and is
   consistent with [RFC5340].  It MUST NOT be directly assigned to any
   interface before following through the procedures defined above.

   This TLV SHOULD be emitted by every home gateway router that has
   either a manual or DHCPv6 PD based prefix that is shorter than /64.

   This TLV MUST appear inside an OSPFv3 Router Auto-Configuration LSA,
   and only in combination with the Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV
   [I-D.acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig] Section 5.2.2 in the same LSA.

5.2.  Assigned Prefix TLV

   The Assigned Prefix TLV is defined for the OSPFv3 Auto-Configuration
   (AC) LSA [I-D.acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig].  It will have type TBD-
   BY-IANA-2 and MUST be advertised in the LSID OSPFv3 AC LSA with an
   LSID of 0.  It MAY occur once or multiple times and the information
   from all TLV instances is retained.  The length of the TLV is
   variable.

   The contents of the TLV include an Interface ID, assigned prefix
   (Prefix), and prefix length (PrefixLength).  The Interface ID is the
   same OSPFv3 Interface ID that is described in section 4.2.1 or
   [RFC5340].  PrefixLength is the length in bits of the prefix and is
   an 8-bit field.  The PrefixLength value MUST be 64 in this version of
   the specification.  The prefix describes an assignment of a global or
   ULA prefix for a directly connected interface in the advertising
   router.  The Prefix is an encoding of the prefix itself as an even
   multiple of 32-bit words, padding with zero bits as necessary.  This
   encoding consumes (PrefixLength + 31) / 32) 32-bit words and is
   consistent with xref target="RFC5340"/>.

   This TLV MUST be emitted by every home router that has made
   assignment from a usable prefix per Section 4.

   This TLV MUST appear inside an OSPFv3 Router Auto-Configuration LSA,
   and only in combination with the Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV
   [I-D.acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig] Section 5.2.2 in the same LSA.

5.3.  OSPFv3 Prefix Assignment

   OSPFv3 Routers supporting the mechanisms in the memo will learn or
   assign a global /64 IPv6 prefix for each IPv6 interface.  Since the
   mechanisms described herein are based on OSPFv3, Router ID assignment
   as described in [I-D.acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig] MUST have completed
   successfully.

   When an OSPFv3 Router receives a global prefix through DHCPv6 prefix
   delegation, manual configuration, or other means, it will advertise
   this prefix by including the Usable Prefix TLV in its OSPFv3 AC LSA.
   This will trigger prefix assignment for auto-configured OSPFv3
   routers within the routing domain including the originating OSPFv3
   router.

   When an OSPFv3 Router receives an AC LSA containing a Usable Prefix
   TLV, it will determine whether or not a new prefix needs to be
   assigned for each of its attached IPv6 interfaces.  For the purposes
   of this discussion, the received prefix will be referred to as the
   Current Usable Prefix.  The following steps will be peformed for each
   IPv6 interface:

   1.  The OSPFv3 Router will determine whether there are any other
       OSPFv3 Routers connected to the same link by examining its list
       of neighbors.

   2.  If no OSPFv3 neighbors have been discovered, the router will wait
       TBD seconds before allocating a unique /64 IPv6 prefix for the
       link as described in step 5.

   3.  If OSPFv3 neighbors are present on the link, the router needs to
       determine whether any of them have already assigned an IPv6
       prefix.  This is done by examing the AC LSAs for neighbors on the
       link and looking for any that include an Assigned Prefix TLV with
       the same OSPFv3 Interface ID as the neighbor.  If one is found
       and is it a subnet of the IPv6 prefix advertised in the Usable
       Prefix TLV, this global IPv6 prefix has been already been
       assigned to the link.  If more than one neighbor's Assigned
       Prefix TLV is found with an IPv6 prefix matching the criteria
       above, the Assigned Prefix advertised by the OSPFv3 router with
       the numerically highest OSPFv3 Router ID takes precedence.

   4.  If there are OSPFv3 neighbors on the link but no IPv6 Prefix is
       found, the task of prefix allocation is delegated to the OSPFv3
       Router with the numerically highest OSPFv3 Router ID.  Note that
       this is different from OSPFv3 Desiginated Router (DR) election,
       as described in [RFC5340], in that the router priority is not
       taken into consideration and that the election will work for
       networks types where no DR is elected, e.g., point-to-point
       links.

   5.  If it is determined that the OSPFv3 Router is responsible for
       prefix assignment on the link, it will:

       *  Examine all the AC LSA including Assigned Prefix TLVs that are
          subnets of the Current Usable Prefix to determine which /64s
          prefixes are already assigned.

       *  Examine former prefix assignments stored in non-volatile
          storage for interface.  Starting with the most recent
          assignment, if the prefix is both a subnet of the Current
          Usable Prefix and is currently unassigned, reuse the
          assignment for the inteface.

       *  If no unused former prefix allocation is found, allocate a new
          one from the subnets of the Current Usable Prefix which are
          unallocated.

       *  Once a global IPv6 prefix is assigned, a new instance of the
          AC LSA will be re-originated including the Assigned Prefix
          TLV.

       *  In the rare event that no global /64 IPv6 prefixes are
          available within the Current Usable Prefix, no IPv6 prefix is
          assigned and an error condition must be raised.

   There are two types of conflicts that may be detected:

   1.  Two or more OSPFv3 routers have assigned the same IPv6 prefix for
       different networks.

   2.  Two of more OSPFv3 routers have assigned different IPv6 prefixes
       for the same network.

   In the case of the former, the OSPFv3 Router with the numerically
   lower OSPFv3 Router ID must select a new prefix and advertise a new
   instance of its AC LSA with an updated Assign Prefix TLV for the
   link.  In the latter case, the OSPFv3 Router with the numerically
   lower OSPFv3 Router ID should accept the global IPv6 prefix from the
   neighbor with the highest OSPFv3 Router ID and originate a new AC LSA
   excluding the Assigned Prefix TLV for the link.


6.  Manageability Considerations

   Advanced users may wish to manage their networks without automation,
   and there may also be situations where manual intervention may be
   needed.  For these purposes there MUST be a configuration mechanism
   that allows users to turn off the automatic prefix assignment on a
   given interface.  This setting can be a part of disabling the entire
   routing auto-configuration [I-D.acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig].

   In addition, there SHOULD be a configuration mechanism that allows
   users to specify the prefix that they would like the router to
   request for a given interface.  This can be useful, for instance,
   when a router is replaced and there is a desire for the new router to
   be configured to ask for the same prefix as the old one, in order to
   avoid renumbering other devices on this network.

   Finally, there SHOULD be mechanisms to display what prefixes the
   router has been assigned, and where they came from (manual
   configuration, DHCPv6 PD, OSPFv3).


7.  Security Considerations

   Security can be always added later.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo makes two allocations out of the OSPFv3 Auto- Configuration
   (AC) LSA TLV namespace [I-D.acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig]:

   o  The Usable Prefix TLV in Section 5.1 takes the value TBD-BY-IANA-1
      (suggested value is 2).
