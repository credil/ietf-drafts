                 Stringprep Revision Problem Statement
               draft-ietf-precis-problem-statement-00.txt

Abstract

   Using Unicode codepoints in protocol strings that expect comparison
   with other strings [[anchor1: The WG will need to decide whether
   "other strings" is too broad.  In particular, what about protocol
   slots that can take strings other than plain ASCII?
   --ajs@shinkuro.com]] requires preparation of the string that contains
   the Unicode codepoints.  Internationalizing Domain Names in
   Applications (IDNA2003) defined and used Stringprep and Nameprep.
   Other protocols subsequently defined Stringprep profiles.  A new
   approach different from Stringprep and Nameprep is used for a
   revision of IDNA2003 (called IDNA2008).  Other Stringprep profiles
   need to be similarly updated or a replacement of Stringprep need to
   be designed.  This document outlines the issues to be faced by those
   designing a Stringprep replacement.

Internet-Draft    Stringprep Revision Problem Statement     October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA2003) [RFC3490],
   [RFC3491], [RFC3492], [RFC3454] described a mechanism for encoding
   UTF-8 labels making up Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) as
   standard DNS labels.  The labels were processed using a method called
   Nameprep [RFC3491] and Punycode [RFC3492].  That method was specific
   to IDNA2003, but is generalized as Stringprep [RFC3454].  The general
   mechanism can be used to help other protocols with similar needs, but
   with different constraints than IDNA2003.

   Stringprep defines a framework within which protocols define their
   Stringprep profiles.  Known IETF specifications using Stringprep are
   listed below:
   o  The Nameprep profile [RFC3490] for use in Internationalized Domain
      Names (IDNs);
   o  NFSv4 [RFC3530] and NFSv4.1 [RFC5661];
   o  The iSCSI profile [RFC3722] for use in Internet Small Computer
      Systems Interface (iSCSI) Names;
   o  EAP [RFC3748];
   o  The Nodeprep and Resourceprep profiles [RFC3920] for use in the
      Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), and the XMPP to
      CPIM mapping [RFC3922];
   o  The Policy MIB profile [RFC4011] for use in the Simple Network
      Management Protocol (SNMP);
   o  The SASLprep profile [RFC4013] for use in the Simple
      Authentication and Security Layer (SASL), and SASL itself
      [RFC4422];
   o  TLS [RFC4279];
   o  IMAP4 using SASLprep [RFC4314];
   o  The trace profile [RFC4505] for use with the SASL ANONYMOUS
      mechanism;
   o  The LDAP profile [RFC4518] for use with LDAP [RFC4511] and its
      authentication methods [RFC4513];
   o  Plain SASL using SASLprep [RFC4616];
   o  NNTP using SASLprep [RFC4643];
   o  PKIX subject identification using LDAPprep [RFC4683];
   o  Internet Application Protocol Collation Registry [RFC4790];
   o  SMTP Auth using SASLprep [RFC4954];
   o  POP3 Auth using SASLprep [RFC5034];
   o  TLS SRP using SASLprep [RFC5054];
   o  IRI and URI in XMPP [RFC5122];
   o  PKIX CRL using LDAPprep [RFC5280];
   o  IAX using Nameprep [RFC5456];
   o  SASL SCRAM using SASLprep [RFC5802];
   o  Remote management of Sieve using SASLprep [RFC5804];

   o  The i;unicode-casemap Unicode Collation [RFC5051].

   There turned out to be some difficulties with IDNA2003, documented in
   [RFC4690].  These difficulties led to a new IDN specification, called
   IDNA2008 [RFC5890], [RFC5891], [RFC5892], [RFC5893].  Additional
   background and explanations of the decisions embodied in IDNA2008 is
   presented in [RFC5894].  One of the effects of IDNA2008 is that
   Nameprep and Stringprep are not used at all.  Instead, an algorithm
   based on Unicode properties of codepoints is defined.  That algorithm
   generates a stable and complete table of the supported Unicode
   codepoints.  This algorithm is based on an inclusion-based approach,
   instead of the exclusion-based approach of Stringprep/Nameprep.

   This document lists the shortcomings and issues found by protocols
   listed above that defined Stringprep profiles.  It also lists some
   early conclusions and requirements for a potential replacement of
   Stringprep.


2.  Usage and Issues of Stringprep

2.1.  Issues raised during newprep BOF

   During IETF 77, a BOF discussed the current state of the protocols
   that have defined Stringprep profiles [NEWPREP].  The main
   conclusions are :
   o  Stringprep is bound to a specific version of Unicode: 3.2.
      Stringprep has not been updated to new versions of Unicode.
      Therefore, the protocols using Stringprep are stuck to Unicode
      3.2.
   o  The protocols need to be updated to support new versions of
      Unicode.  The protocols would like to not be bound to a specific
      version of Unicode, but rather have better Unicode agility in the
      way of IDNA2008.  This is important partly because it is usually
      impossible for an application to require Unicode 3.2; the
      application gets whatever version of Unicode is available on the
      host.
   o  The protocols require better bidirectional support (bidi) than
      currently offered by Stringprep.
   o  If the protocols are updated to use a new version of Stringprep or
      another framework, then backward compatibility is an important
      requirement.  For example, Stringprep is based on and may use NFKC
      [UAX15], while IDNA2008 mostly uses NFC [UAX15].
   o  Protocols use each other; for example, a protocol can use user
      identifiers that are later passed to SASL, LDAP or another
      authentication mechanism.  Therefore, common set of rules or
      classes of strings are preferred over specific rules for each
      protocol.

Internet-Draft    Stringprep Revision Problem Statement     October 2010


   Protocols that use Stringprep profiles use strings for different
   purposes:
   o  XMPP uses a different Stringprep profile for each part of the XMPP
      address (JID): a localpart which is similar to a username and used
      for authentication, a domainpart which is a domain name and a
      resource part which is less restrictive than the localpart.
   o  iSCSI uses a Stringprep profile for the IQN, which is very similar
      to (often is) a DNS domain name.
   o  SASL and LDAP uses a Stringprep profile for usernames.
   o  LDAP uses a set of Stringprep profiles.

   During the newprep BOF, it was the consensus of the attendees that it
   would be highly preferable to have a replacement of Stringprep, with
   similar characteristics to IDNA2008.  That replacement should be
   defined so that the protocols could use internationalized strings
   without a lot of specialized internationalization work, since
   internationalization expertise is not available in the respective
   protocols or working groups.

2.2.  Specific issues with particular Stringprep profiles

   [[anchor6: This section is where issues raised in the individual
   profile reviews goes.  A review of the WG trac state on 2010-10-06 of
   the tracker suggests those reviews haven't happened yet.
   --ajs@shinkuro.com]]

2.3.  Inclusion vs. exclusion of characters

   One of the primary changes of IDNA2008 is in the way it approaches
   Unicode characters.  IDNA2003 created an explicit list of excluded or
   mapped-away characters; anything in Unicode 3.2 that was not so
   listed could be assumed to be allowed under the protocol.  IDNA2008
   begins instead from the assumption that characters are disallowed,
   and then relies on Unicode properties to derive whether a given
   character actually is allowed in the protocol.

   Moreover, there is more than one class of "allowed in the protocol".
   While some characters are simply disallowed, some are allowed only in
   certain contexts.  The reasons for the context-dependent rules have
   to do with the way some characters are used.  For instance, the ZERO
   WIDTH JOINER and ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER characters (ZWJ, U+200D and
   ZWNJ, U+200C) are allowed with contextual rules because they are
   required in some circumstances, yet are considered punctuation by
   Unicode and would therefore be DISALLOWED under the usual IDNA2008
   derivation rules.

   The working group needs to decide whether similar contextual cases
   need to be supported.

2.4.  Stringprep and NFKC

   Stringprep profiles may use normalization.  If they do, they use NFKC
   [UAX15].  It is not clear that NFKC is the right normalization to use
   in all cases.  In [UAX15], there is the following observation
   regarding Normalization Forms KC and KD: "It is best to think of
   these Normalization Forms as being like uppercase or lowercase
   mappings: useful in certain contexts for identifying core meanings,
   but also performing modifications to the text that may not always be
   appropriate."  For things like the spelling of users' names, then,
   NKFC may not be the best form to use.  At the same time, one of the
   nice things about NFKC is that it deals with the width of characters
   that are otherwise similar, by canonicalizing half-width to full-
   width.  This mapping step can be crucial in practice.  The WG will
   need to analyze the different use profiles and consider whether NFKC
   or NFC is a better normalization for each profile.

2.5.  Case mapping

   In IDNA2003, labels are always mapped to lower case before the
   Punycode transformation.  In IDNA2003, there is no mapping at all:
   input is either a valid U-label or it is not.  At the same time,
   upper-case characters are by definition not valid U-labels, because
   they fall into the Unstable category (category B) of [RFC5892].

   If there are protocols that require upper and lower cases be
   preserved, then the analogy with IDNA2008 will break down.  The
   working group will need to decide whether there are any cases that
   require upper case, and what to do about it if so.

2.6.  Whether to use ASCII-compatible encoding

   The development of IDNA2008 depended on the notion that there was a
   narrow repertoire of reasonable traditional labels, and what was
   necessary was to internationalize that repertoire rather than to
   incorporate any characters into domain name labels.  More exactly,
   the idea was to internationalize the traditional hostname rules (the
   "LDH rule".  See [RFC4690], section 5.1.).  Efforts to
   internationalize email ([RFC5336]) have started from different
   assumptions.  The email example suggests that in some cases, the
   right answer might be to internationalize the target protocol rather
   than to depend on a technology to ensure protocol slots can use only
   ASCII.  The working group will need to determine which approach is
   correct for the different use-cases.

Internet-Draft    Stringprep Revision Problem Statement     October 2010


2.7.  Issues with delimiters

   There are two kinds of issues to address with delimiters.  First,
   exactly where a delimiter will appear on the screen when dealing with
   bidirectional parts of a string can be extremely surprising.  In the
   case of IDNA2008, just what to do in these cases remains a display
   issue (there is no question about the wire format, because the wire
   format is an A-label and it is always left to right).

   Second, there is the question of whether to include different kinds
   of protocol separators.  For instance, FULL STOP, U+002E (.) may not
   be available on all keyboards.  In addition, in some languages there
   is more than one full stop which are variants of one another.  The
   working group will need to decide how to handle such cases: whether
   there will be a mapping, some restrictions, or something else.


3.  Considerations for Stringprep replacement

   The above suggests the following direction for the working group:
   o  A stringprep replacement should be defined.
   o  The replacement should take an approach similar to IDNA2008, in
      that it enables Unicode agility.
   o  Protocols share similar characteristics of strings.  Therefore,
      defining i18n preparation algorithms for a (small) set of string
      classes may be sufficient for most cases and provides the
      coherence among a set of protocol friends.
   o  The sets of string classes need to be evaluated for the following
      properties:
      *  the normalization needed (NFC vs NFKC);
      *  whether case-folding, case preservation, and case-insensitive
         matching is needed;
      *  what restrictions on input are reasonable for the class (i.e.
         whether there is something like an "LDH rule" for the class),
         or whether the ASCII-only input in the protocol slot is lightly
         constrained;
      *  the extent to which bidi considerations are important for the
         class.

   Existing deployments already depend on Stringprep profiles.
   Therefore, the working group will need to consider the effects of any
   new strategy on existing deployments.  By way of comparison, it is
   worth noting that some characters were acceptable in IDNA labels
   under IDNA2003, but are not protocol-valid under IDNA2008 (and
   conversely).  Different implementers may make different decisions
   about what to do in such cases; this could have interoperability
   effects.  The working group will need to trade better support for
   different linguistic environments against the potential side effects

   of backward incompatibility.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document merely states what problems are to be solved, and does
   not define a protocol.  There are undoubtedly security implications
   of the particular results that will come from the work to be
   completed.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


6.  Discussion home for this draft

   This document is intended to define the problem space discussed on
   the precis@ietf.org mailing list.
