Internet-Draft                NomCom Issues                     May 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), the Internet
   Architecture Board (IAB), and at-large IETF representatives to the
   IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) are selected by a
   "Nominating and Recall Committee" (universally abbreviated as
   "NomCom").  [RFC3777] defines how the NomCom is selected, and the
   processes it follows as it selects candidates for these positions.

   This document describes an issue with [RFC3777] that causes an
   avoidable delay in the NomCom process, and specifies a normative
   update to resolve the issue.


2.  Background of this document

   [RFC3777] is the latest in a series of revisions to the NomCom
   process.  [RFC3777] has been updated once since 2004, but this update
   ([RFC5078] did not change normative text (it replaced a sample
   timeline).

   [RFC5078] identified a serial delay in the process described in
   [RFC3777], in section 4, "Nominating Committee Selection", bullet 13,
   which states:

      The Chair obtains the list of IESG and IAB positions to be
      reviewed and announces it along with a solicitation for names of
      volunteers from the IETF community willing to serve on the
      nominating committee.

      The solicitation must permit the community at least 30 days during
      which they may choose to volunteer to be selected for the
      nominating committee.

      The list of open positions is published with the solicitation to
      facilitate community members choosing between volunteering for an
      open position and volunteering for the nominating committee.

   The result is that the Incoming NomCom Chair is the only person who
   can announce the list of open positions and solicitation for names of
   volunteers, a process that requires 30 days for public solicitation.

   Since this is the first step in organizing the NomCom committee,
   delays in selecting the Incoming NomCom Chair translate directly into
   delays in issuing the solicitation and organizing the NomCom.

   This proved problematic in practice in 2008-2009, when Joel Halpern
   was named NomCom Chair less than 30 days prior to the Second IETF

   meeting.  If the 30-day solicitation had already taken place, the
   Nomcom could have conducted face-to-face interviews at the Second
   IETF meeting, but since the required 30-day solicitation didn't start
   until Joel was named, Joel was unable to assemble his NomCom before
   the Second IETF meeting, and the NomCom had to carry out these
   interviews using e-mail and conference calls.

   It is desirable to allow the solicitation and announcement to take
   place in a timely manner so that when an Incoming NomCom Chair IS
   named, the NomCom Chair can immediately begin executing the NomCom
   process.


3.  Discussion

   This document proposes that the IETF Secretariat will issue the
   announcement of open positions and the solicitation for names of
   volunteers on behalf of the Incoming NomCom Chair who will be named
   by the ISOC President.  This allows the search for the Incoming
   NomCom Chair and volunteers to proceed in parallel.

   This process change covers only the the announcement of open
   positions and solicitation for names of volunteers.  The goal of this
   process change is *not* to allow the NomCom process to move to
   completion without an Incoming NomCom Chair, it is only to ensure
   that the Incoming NomCom Chair can begin executing the NomCom process
   without an avoidable delay, and can use face-to-face time at the
   Second IETF meeting effectively for this purpose.

   During discussions in the IETF 74 timeframe, it was suggested that we
   also allow the secretariat to perform other clerical tasks that
   aren't called out specifically in the NomCom process, but which
   clearly do not require NomCom chair judgement.  This document does
   not provide guidance about specific clerical tasks that would be
   appropriate for the secretariat to carry out.  Instead, either the
   Incoming NomCom Chair (if one has been selected) or the Outgoing
   NomCom Chair (if the search for an Incoming NomCom Chair is still
   underway) may request the secretariat to perform these tasks, with
   appropriate notification to the community.


4.  Updated text from RFC 3777

   For [RFC3777], in section 4, "Nominating Committee Selection", bullet
   13, which states:






Dawkins                 Expires November 25, 2009               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                NomCom Issues                     May 2009


      The Chair obtains the list of IESG and IAB positions to be
      reviewed and announces it along with a solicitation for names of
      volunteers from the IETF community willing to serve on the
      nominating committee.

   this text is replaced with the following text:

      The IETF Secretariat obtains the list of positions to be reviewed
      and announces it along with a solicitation for names of volunteers
      from the IETF community willing to serve on the nominating
      committee.

      At the NomCom Chair's request, the secretariat may perform other
      clerical support tasks, as long as the task being performed does
      not require NomCom Chair judgement, in the NomCom Chair's opinion,
      and as long as the community is appropriately notified that this
      request is being made.  This request may come from the Incoming
      NomCom Chair (if one has been selected for this NomCom cycle) or
      the Outgoing NomCom Chair (if the search for an Incoming NomCom
      Chair is still underway).

   Note: This text no longer specifies the list of bodies that NomCom
   reviews, rather than adding IAOC to the list of bodies in the text,
   so that this text need not change further when NomCom review
   responsibilities change.


5.  Possible Topics for Later Discussion

   This section includes topics that came up during discussion of this
   document, which were not included in the normative changes contained
   in this document, because the goal for this document was incremental
   improvement, and these topics were more than incremental changes.
   They may be discussed further, or not, but we're less likely to
   forget them completely if we write them down.

   [RFC3777] tightly couples the announcement of open positions and call
   for volunteers, and this document didn't try to unravel these two
   separate actions.  We had a request during discussion to separate
   them, so that a NomCom could consider the management structure of the
   IETF and the position descriptions that the leadership bodies
   provide, before announcing the positions being reviewed.


6.  Security Considerations

   This specification describes issues with the current IETF Nominating
   Committee process ([RFC3777]) and proposes an update to avoid a

   serial delay.  No security considerations apply.


7.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are requested in this specification.
