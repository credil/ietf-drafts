1.  Introduction

   Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support [3] allows a whole network to
   change its point of attachment while maintaining reachability and
   session continuity. [4] and [5] investigate the inefficiencies in
   NEMO Basic Support, and analyze the solution space for Route
   Optimization (RO) with NEMO from a technical perspective.

   This document explores the different deployment scenarios of NEMO
   from the perspective of consumer electronics.  This mainly entails a
   personal device, called the Personal Mobile Router, as the primary
   node which a user utilizes to allow the user's other devices to
   communicate with other nodes in the global Internet.  This is
   detailed in Section 2.  From these deployments, a set of requirements
   is inferred in Section 3.

   It is expected for readers to be familiar with terminologies related
   to mobility in [1] and NEMO related terms defined in [2].  Interested
   readers may also refer to [6] and [7] for the requirements from the
   automobile and aviation industries respectively.


2.  Deployments of Personal Mobile Router

   The Personal Mobile Router is generally envisaged as a mobile
   communications device, most probably a cellular handphone, with
   embedded router functionality so as to allow other personal devices
   (such as MP3 Players, Digital Cameras) to access the global Internet.
   In such a deployment, it is expected for the Personal Mobile Router
   to provide all the routing capabilities of the personal area network.
   This means that one would generally not expect devices (i.e.  LFNs)
   such as digital camera or music players to have routing capabilities.
   In other words, LFNs are envisaged as simple IPv6 hosts.

   However, it is possible for there to be a Local Mobile Node (MNN) in
   the personal area network.  For instance, a laptop or a WLAN-enabled
   PDA can break off from the personal area network and connect to the
   Internet on its own.  Thus, the device becomes a MIPv6 host, with its
   home address configured from the Mobile Network Prefix of the
   personal area network.

   This section illustrates three different deployment scenarios with
   respect to the Personal Mobile Router.  First is a simple personal
   area network where NEMO services is provided by a service provider
   (such as an telecommunications operator).  Next is the deployment
   where the Personal Mobile Router is docked within a car and serves as
   an additional Mobile Router for the car network.  The last scenario
   is the case where the Personal Mobile Router obtains a network prefix

Internet-Draft            NEMO CE Requirements             November 2007


   not directly from its Internet service providers.  Instead, the
   network prefix is allocated from the user's residence.


2.1.  Simple Personal Area Network

   The simplest deployment is when the Personal Mobile Router is simply
   used to provide Internet access to other devices in a user's personal
   area network.  This is the case where the user subscribes to a
   mobility service provider that allocates a network prefix for the
   user's personal area network.  One example of this is the 3GPP
   Personal Network Management services [8].

   For this scenario, typical communications will be audio/video
   streaming from a multimedia content server to the music/video player
   in the user's personal area network.  This is a case of
   communications between a LFN with a CN in the global internet.

                      Figure 1: Simple PAN deployment


   An alternative situation will be communications between devices from
   two (or more) different personal area networks.  For example, two
   different users may engage in a game with their personal
   entertainment devices (such as Nintendo or Play Station portables),
   or share their audio files stored in their music players.  This is a
   case of communications between two LFNs from different NEMO.

   An interesting scenario of a Personal Area Network that is beginning
   to emerge is where the Personal Area Network is composed of a
   Personal Mobile Router and wearable sensors.  Typical deployment [9]
   would be for a patient who wears wearable sensors that monitor his/
   her physical conditions (eg., heartbeat, body temperature, blood
   pressure, etc) periodically and transmit the measurement to a
   hospital server through the Personal Mobile Router.  This is a case
   of communications between LFNs and a CN wherein the main traffic from
   the LFN to the CN.

   A more complex use case for Personal Area Network can be described as
   a dynamic change (scenario) between two different Personal Area
   Network situations having the same entities.  Each entity dynamically
   changes its role (from, for example, MR to LFN), and, more
   importantly, the routing task is moved from one entity to another.

   Consider a Personal Area Network built from one PDA and one laptop.
   In the first situation, the laptop is the Mobile Router.  It uses its
   WiMax interface to connect to the Internet and its WiFi interface to
   offer access to the PDA.  Following this, a second situation is
   formed where the PDA connects its 3G interface to the Internet
   (becoming the Mobile Router) and gives access to the laptop over
   WiFi.  This is illustrated in Figure 4 below.

                    Figure 4: Switching of Roles in PAN

   Both these situations can exist independently, as there are existing
   software that is currently supporting these.  For example, both
   Microsoft Windows XP (laptop) and Windows Mobile (PDA) have the
   ability to connect one interface to Internet and offer access over
   the other interface.

   However, the automatic change between these two situations is not
   possible without user intervention.  The issues around this relate to
   interface configuration, default route configuration and others.  If
   Mobile IP is used then there are additional issues with respect to
   pre-established behavior (eg. use or do not use tunnels).

   An example application where this support is needed is described
   next.  The scenario above describes the movement of the main routing
   task from the laptop to the PDA.  The routing task (run Mobile IP and
   NEMO, and hide the LFN from mobility events) can be very consuming



Ng, et al.                Expires May 21, 2008                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            NEMO CE Requirements             November 2007


   and can compete with user interface events.  For example, a user of a
   laptop and PDA sets up the laptop as MR and PDA as LFN.  The user
   continues editing a document on the laptop.  Then, another user
   arrives with a laptop and needs access.  At this point the first user
   is actually interested in making the PDA to be MR (and not his/her
   laptop) thus avoiding being disturbed by the more consuming routing
   task of laptop (routing for two users is doubled).

   Depending on the communicating applications, these kinds of scenarios
   needing dynamic change of role of the entity performing the routing
   task can be very numerous.

2.2.  Personal Mobile Router in a Car

   A second scenario involving the Personal Mobile Router is when the
   user docks the Personal Mobile Router into a car network.  This
   allows the communications devices in the vehicle to use the Personal
   Mobile Router to access information from the Internet.  It also
   allows the personal devices in the personal area network to use the
   Mobile Router in the vehicle network to communicate with
   correspondent nodes on the Internet.  In other words, the two mobile
   networks (personal area network and vehicle network) merges to form a
   multihomed network.

   There are two possible configurations that could arise.  The first
   possible configuration is where the car sensors and automotive
   devices are connected to Car Mobile Router using a wired medium (such
   as the Controller Area Network, etc), and the personal devices are
   connected to the Personal Mobile Router using a wireless medium (such
   as the Bluetooth or Ultra Wide Band).  The Personal Mobile Router is
   connected to the Car Mobile Router via a docking mechanism installed
   in the car.  This is illustrated in Figure 5 below.

   personal area network devices will continue to use their own original
   network prefixes to communicate with external nodes.  Hence, one way
   to view this is to treat it as if the two Mobile Routers attaches to
   each other, and uses each other as an additional access router.  This
   implies that the a communication between a MNN and a correspondent
   node may go through two Mobile Routers (e.g. the communication from
   the car navigation device to a traffic condition server passes
   through first the Mobile Router of the car, and then the Personal
   Mobile Router).  Hence, this can be viewed as a case of a nested
   NEMO.

   A second possibility is that the car network and the personal area
   network fused into a single network with two mobile routers.  One way
   this can happen is when the two networks use the same wireless
   technology such as Bluetooth or Wireless Universal Serial Bus as the
   interconnection medium.  This is shown in Figure 6 below.  This is a
   typical NEMO with multiple mobile routers and prefixes [10].  The car
   devices are free to configure an address from the Mobile Network
   Prefix of the Personal Mobile Router to communicate with other
   correspondent nodes in the Internet (such as a realtime traffic
   monitoring server).  Similarly, the personal devices are free to
   configure an address from the Mobile Network Prefix of the Car Mobile
   Router to communicate with other correspondent nodes in the Internet
   (such as a You-Tube video server).

                  Figure 6: A Single Link in Merged NEMO

   When the car network and the personal area network fused into a
   single network, LFNs in this single network can communicate with each
   other.  For example, a sensor which was a LFN of the personal area

   network senses the body temperature of the driver and send this
   information to the activator which was a LFN of the car network to
   make the car environment comfortable for the driver.  Since the car
   network and the personal area network became a single network, this
   communication is a case of intra-NEMO communication.

2.3.  Residence Home Network

   This scenario is a special deployment as it differs from the usual
   subscription model that is more commonly used.  Basically, in this
   scenario, the home network of the Personal Mobile Router (as far as
   NEMO is concerned) is literally the "home" -- i.e. the residence of
   the user.  It is envisioned that the user deploys a residence-wide
   network with a set-top box serving as the gateway.  This set-top box
   is connected to the Internet via broadband connection (cable or ADSL)
   and obtains an IPv6 prefix from the ISP.  Part of the IPv6 prefix
   obtained is then assigned as the prefix for the user's personal are
   network (i.e. the Mobile Network Prefix for the personal area
   network).  The set-top box is thus configured as the home agent of
   the Personal Mobile Router.

   Typically, the devices in the personal area network (i.e.  LFNs)
   would communicate mostly with other devices in the residence network
   (e.g. personal video player accessing movie stored in a digital video
   recorder in the residence).  In such situation, route optimization is
   redundant.  However, there exist situations where multiple personal
   area networks (each belonging to different family members) belong to
   the same residence network.  Devices from these different personal
   area networks may communicate with each other often enough.  In the
   latter situation, it is a case of two MNNs from different NEMO
   communicating with each other.


3.  Consumer Electronics Requirements for Route Optimization

   Not all communications involving personal area network require route
   optimization.  There are, however, two particular use cases where
   route optimization is highly preferable.  The first use case is when
   devices in a personal area network are used for real time interactive
   applications which are sensitive to round trip delays.  Examples
   include voice-over-IP communications and multiplayer gaming sessions.
   This usually entails communications between two devices from two
   different personal area network, as illustrated in Section 2.1 and
   Section 2.3.  In such cases, there might be two different home agents
   involved (one for each NEMO), hence making the improvement in delay
   reduction of route optimization more significant.  The second use
   case is when the home network is congested, or otherwise bandwidth-
   limited.  One example is the residence home network as described in

   Section 2.3.  Most broadband residence access are asymmetrical (i.e.
   the uplink bandwidth is much smaller than the downlink bandwidth),
   making it unsuitable for the home agent (e.g. set-top box) to forward
   large amount of packets to Personal Mobile Routers.

   Where route optimization is highly preferable, we can infer the
   following requirements (denoted by "Req") and desirable features
   (denoted by "Des") from the deployment scenarios described in
   Section 2.

   o  Req1: Unmodified LFNs

         A route optimization solution MUST operate even when LFNs are
         unmodified

      Rationale:

         Devices in the personal area network are envisaged as simple
         IPv6 node.  The Personal Mobile Router is expected to provide
         route optimization services for any consumer electronic devices
         that connect to its personal area network.  Thus, it is
         expected for LFNs to remain unmodified and unaware of mobile
         network's movement for route optimizations.

   o  Req2: Low Processing Load

         A route optimization solution MUST NOT increase the processing
         load of the MR significantly

      Rationale:

         The Personal Mobile Router is a small mobile device (e.g.
         handphone) that is limited in battery power.  Hence, any route
         optimization solution should not significantly increases the
         processing load of the MR.

   o  Req3: Security

         A route optimization solution MUST NOT expose the mobile
         network to additional security risk

      Rationale:

         Security is a prime consideration in the deployment of Personal
         Mobile Router, since the personal area network may store
         private information.  In general, a personal area network would
         not allow external devices to attach to the mobile network,
         hence the Personal Mobile Router will the most important

         gateway in which security of the personal area network is
         enforced.  As such, any route optimization solution should not
         expose the Personal Mobile Router to additional risk as
         compared to NEMO Basic Support.

         Particularly, it must not be possible for other nodes to claim
         ownership of the Mobile Network Prefix (in entirety or in
         parts).  Additionally, denial-of service attacks on the
         Personal Mobile Router (e.g. by forcing the Personal Mobile
         Router to send a huge amount of signaling packets or to
         maintain a large number of signaling states) must not be
         possible.

   o  Des1: MR-to-MR Route Optimization

      As seen in Section 2, most of the communications we envisaged are
      in the form of a MNN communicating with another MNN in different
      personal area networks.  As we do not expect MNNs to be involved
      in route optimization signaling, a suitable route optimization
      would likely be between the two MRs.  This way, correspondent
      nodes would not be impacted.

   o  Des2: Nested-NEMO Route Optimization

      In Section 2.2, a scenario is illustrated where the Personal
      Mobile Router is attaching to the car mobile router for Internet
      access (and vice versa).  If the car mobile router performs route
      optimization for its network, then the Personal Mobile Router can
      run a separate route optimization session to achieve fully-
      optimized route.  Alternatively, it is also possible for the
      Personal Mobile Router to support some mechanism that achieve
      nested-NEMO route optimization.

   o  Des3: Intra-NEMO Route Optimization

      In Section 2.2, a scenario is illustrated where nodes in a the car
      network and nodes in the personal area network communicates with
      each other.  It is desirable that any route optimization solution
      would work for intra-NEMO communications as well.  It will be even
      preferable if such intra-NEMO route optimizations can be achieved
      without sending signalling messages out of the mobile network.
