Internet-Draft   Requirements for QoS Location Filtering        Nov 2007


1.  Introduction

   Location QoS is described with a set of location QoS parameters
   (i.e., positioning accuracy, location response time, etc.) and
   corresponding values.  Different services and applications that use
   Location Information may require different location QoS.  For
   example, the positioning accuracy may be an important parameter for
   some services/applications.  The minimum acceptable positioning
   accuracy for various services/applications may vary from meters
   (e.g., in navigation) to kilometers (e.g., in local weather reports).
   In such a context it should be possible to specify required location
   QoS in terms of defining an acceptable set of parameters and their
   values to provide a valid response to the location request.  A valid
   location response is considered as a response that fulfills the
   location QoS requirements specified in the location request.

   This document defines requirements for a Location QoS Information
   Object needed for expressing the required level of location QoS.
   This is achieved by defining a required set of location QoS
   parameters that are of relevance to the recipient of Location
   Information (Location Recipient).


2.  Requirements Terminology

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   This document reuses the terminology of [RFC3693] such as Location
   Information (LS), Target, Location Server (LS), and Location
   Recipient (LR).

3.1.  Terms

   Location QoS Information Object:  An object conveying required or
      desired location QoS information.


4.  Location QoS Information

   This section of the document describes location QoS information that
   is used to express a required or desired level of location service
   quality, in terms of minimum horizontal and vertical accuracy,

   maximum response time, and maximum age of requested Location
   Information.

   This document defines the following as the list of location QoS
   parameters:

   o  horizontal accuracy
   o  vertical accuracy
   o  age
   o  response time
   o  QoS class

4.1.  Horizontal accuracy

   Usually the position of a Target is expressed as a point (either in
   two or three dimensions) and an area or volume of positioning
   uncertainty around that point.  The size of positioning uncertainty
   area/volume can be used as a measure of positioning accuracy.  If the
   uncertainty area/volume is smaller, the positioning accuracy is
   higher.

   The horizontal accuracy of Location Information is described with
   maximum horizontal size of a positioning uncertainty area/volume.

   The horizontal accuracy parameter specifies maximum acceptable
   horizontal size of a positioning uncertainty area/volume.

   If this parameter is not present, the Location Server may include
   Location Information with any horizontal accuracy as long as
   requirements defined with other QoS parameters are fulfilled.

   The Location Server shall normally attempt to satisfy or approach as
   closely as possible the requested horizontal accuracy when other
   location QoS parameters are not in conflict.  The achieved accuracy
   level of Location Information shall be indicated using the shapes and
   uncertainty areas as described in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile].

4.2.  Vertical accuracy

   The vertical accuracy of Location Information is described with
   maximum vertical size of a positioning uncertainty area/volume.

   The vertical accuracy parameter specifies maximum acceptable vertical
   size of a positioning uncertainty area/volume.

   If this parameter is not present, the Location Server may include
   Location Information with any vertical accuracy as long as
   requirements defined with other QoS parameters are fulfilled.

Internet-Draft   Requirements for QoS Location Filtering        Nov 2007


   The Location Server shall normally attempt to satisfy or approach as
   closely as possible the requested vertical accuracy when other
   location QoS parameters are not in conflict.

4.3.  Age of the Location Information

   The age parameter states the maximum allowable age of the Location
   Information that is being sent in a response to a Location Recipient.
   This Location Information may have been cached in the system from a
   previous location query.

   If this parameter is not present, the Location Server may include
   Location Information of any age as long as requirements defined with
   other QoS parameters are fulfilled.

   The Location Server shall normally attempt to satisfy or approach as
   closely as possible the requested age when other location QoS
   parameters are not in conflict.

4.4.  Response Time

   Response time is defined as the time needed for the Location Server
   to send a response with the Location Information after having
   received a location request.  Different Location Recipients may have
   different requirements for the response time.  In some cases the
   response time may depend on the positioning accuracy and on age of
   the Location Information.  This relation may be dependent on the
   positioning technique that is used to determine a Target's position.
   The Location Server may need to make trade-offs between these three
   parameters.

   The response time parameter defines maximum allowable time needed for
   the Location Server to send a response with the Location Information
   after having received a location request.

   If this parameter is not present, the Location Server may respond
   with Location Information at any time as long as requirements defined
   with other QoS parameters are fulfilled.

   The Location Server shall normally attempt to satisfy or approach as
   closely as possible the requested response time when other location
   QoS parameters are not in conflict.

4.5.  QoS class

   The QoS class defines the degree of adherence of the location service
   to given QoS parameters: horizontal and vertical accuracy, response
   time, and age of Location Information.



Busin, et al.             Expires May 14, 2008                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   Requirements for QoS Location Filtering        Nov 2007


   There are two location QoS classes defined: "Assured" and "Best
   effort" [3GPP.22.071].

   The "Assured" location QoS class presumes strict adherence to given
   QoS parameters.  The Location Server must obtain Location Information
   while fulfilling the requirements set by the other QoS parameters
   (horizontal and vertical accuracy, age, and response time).  If the
   location response does not satisfy QoS parameters, the response will
   be discarded by the Location Server.

   The "Best effort" location QoS class presumes that QoS parameters are
   not adhered to strictly.  The Location Server shall obtain Location
   Information while fulfilling the requirements set by the other QoS
   parameters, but it will not discard the response if other QoS
   parameters are not satisfied.

   The "Best effort" class is considered as the default QoS class in the
   case that there is no location QoS class parameter definition
   provided in the request.


5.  Location QoS Information Object Requirements

   The Location Recipient may request that the Location Server provides
   it with the GEOPRIV location information concerning a particular
   Target [RFC3693].  In a location request, the Location Recipient MAY
   optionally include a Location QoS Information Object that defines
   required location QoS.  The using protocol for the exchange of
   Location QoS Information Object is out of the scope of this document.

   Req. 1.(Location QoS Information Object generalities):

   1.1)  Geopriv MUST define one Location QoS Information Object, both
      in syntax and semantics that must be supported by the Location
      Recipient and the Location Server.
   1.2)  Some fields of the Location QoS Information Object MAY be
      optional.  This means that an instance of a Location QoS
      Information Object MAY contain the optional fields.
   1.3)  Some fields of the Location QoS Information Object MAY be
      defined as "extensions".  This means that the syntax or semantics
      of these fields is not fully defined in the basic Location QoS
      Information Object definition, but their use may be private to one
      or more of the using protocols.
   1.4)  The Location QoS Information Object MUST be extensible,
      allowing the definition of new attributes or fields.

Internet-Draft   Requirements for QoS Location Filtering        Nov 2007


   1.5)  The Location QoS Information Object MUST be usable in a variety
      of protocols, such as HTTP and SIP.

   Req. 2.(Location QoS Information Object fields) The Location QoS
   Information Object definition MUST contain the following fields,
   which MAY be optional to use:

   2.1)  horizontal accuracy parameter
   2.2)  vertical accuracy parameter
   2.3)  age parameter
   2.4)  response time parameter
   2.5)  QoS class parameter


6.  Security Considerations

   Privacy and security considerations related to Location Information
   are discussed in detail in [RFC3693].


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require actions by the IANA.
