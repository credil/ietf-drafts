Abstract

   This document describes some important characteristics of
   communication between nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network.
   These are not requirements in the sense usually understood as
   applying to formulation of a requirements document.  Nevertheless,
   protocol engineers and system analysts involved with designing
   solutions for ad hoc networks must maintain awareness of these
   characteristics.

Internet-Draft   Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless Communication        May 2010


1.  Introduction

   The goal of this document is to describe some important aspects of
   multi-hop ad hoc wireless communication.  These characteristics have
   been very well researched, and numerous results have been published
   during many years of experience dealing with wireless communications.
   Experience gathered with [RFC2501] [RFC3626] [RFC3561] [RFC3684]
   [RFC4728] [RFC5449] [DoD01] shows that this type of communication
   presents specific challenges that are relevant to the design of
   Internet protocols that are intended for establishing connectivity in
   multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks.  This document briefly describes
   some of these challenges.

2.  Communication in Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless Networks

   In this document, we consider a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network to
   be a collection of devices that all have radio transceivers using the
   same physical and medium access protocols.  They may be configured to
   provide store-and-forward functionality on top of these protocols, as
   needed to enable communications; consequently, such nodes would
   usually be classified as routers in the resulting wireless network.
   In the following, we will just refer to these devices as nodes.

   Let A and B be two nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network N.
   Suppose that, when node A transmits a packet through its interface on
   network N, that packet is detectable by node B without requiring
   storage and/or forwarding by any other node.  In this circumstance,
   we will say that B can receive packets directly from A.
   Alternatively, we may also say that B "hears" packets from A. Note
   that therefore, when B can hear IP packets from A, the TTL of the IP
   packet heard by B will be precisely the same as it was when A
   transmitted that packet.

   Let S be the set of nodes that can hear packets transmitted by node A
   through its interface on network N. We will now describe some
   fundamental characteristics of multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   communication.  Because of these characteristics, some assumptions
   about packet transmission that are typically made in wired networks,
   are often untrue in multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks.

2.1.  Asymmetry, Time-Variation, and Non-Transitivity

   First, there is no guarantee that a node C within S can,
   symmetrically, send IP packets directly to node A. In other words,
   even though C can "hear" packets from node A (since it is a member of
   set S), there is no guarantee that A can "hear" packets from node C.
   Thus, multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications may be "asymmetric".
   Such asymmetry is often experienced on multi-hop ad hoc wireless

   networks, due to well-known properties of wireless communication.

   Second, there is no guarantee that, as a set, S is at all stable.
   The membership of set S may in fact change at any rate, any time.
   Thus, multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications may be "time-variant".
   Such variations are often experienced in multi-hop ad hoc wireless
   networks due to variability of the wireless medium, and to node
   mobility.

   Now, conversely, let V be the set of nodes from which A can directly
   receive packets -- in other words, A can "hear" packets from any node
   in set V. Suppose that node A is communicating at time t0 through its
   interface on network N. As a consequence of time variation and
   asymmetry, we observe that A:

   1.  cannot assume that S = V,

   2.  cannot assume that S and/or V are unchanged at time t1 later than
       t0.

   Furthermore, transitivity is not guaranteed over multi-hop ad hoc
   wireless networks.  Indeed, let's assume that, through their
   respective interfaces within network N:

   1.  node B and node A can hear each other (i.e. node B is a member of
       sets S and V), and,

   2.  node A and node C can also hear each other (i.e. node C is a also
       a member of sets S and V).

   This neither implies that node B can hear node C, nor that node C can
   hear node B (through their interface on network N).  Such non-
   transitivity is often observed on multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks.

   In a nutshell: multi-hop ad hoc wireless communications often prove
   to be asymmetric, non-transitive, and time-varying in character.

2.2.  Radio Range and Wireless Irregularities

   In Section 2.1 we presented an abstract description of some multi-hop
   ad hoc wireless communication characteristics.  This section points
   out a practical reality, at the root of these characteristics.

   Wireless communication links are often subject to significant
   limitations to the distance across which they may be established.  In
   the extreme cases, some radio links are measured in centimeters, not
   meters, although such short-range radio links are not typically
   considered to support multi-hop ad hoc networks.  More often, radio

Internet-Draft   Multi-hop Ad Hoc Wireless Communication        May 2010


   links are encountered with range limited to several tens or hundreds
   of meters.

   The range-limitation factor creates specific problems, observed in
   multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks.  In this context, it is indeed
   not rare that the radio ranges of several nodes partially overlap.
   This partial overlap often causes communication on multi-hop ad hoc
   wireless networks to be non-transitive and/or asymmetric, as
   described in Section 2.1.

   For example, it often happens that a sending node transmits a packet
   at higher power than is used by the node receiving the packet.

                      Radio Ranges for Nodes A and B

                   <~~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~>
                                 |      <~~~~~~+~~~~~~>
                              +--|--+       +--|--+
                              |NodeA|======>|NodeB|

      Figure 1: Asymmetric Link example. Node A can communicate with
            node B, but node B cannot communicate with node A.

   Another example, depicted in Figure 2, is known as the "hidden node"
   problem.  Even though the nodes are shown as all having equal power
   for their radio transmissions, they are not at all equally accessible
   to each other.  In the figure, nodes B and C cannot hear each other.
   On the other hand, nodes A and B can hear each other while A and C
   can also hear each other.  When nodes B and C try to communicate with
   node A at the same time, their radio signals collide.  Node A will
   only be able to detect noisy interference, and may even be unable to
   determine the source of the issue.  The hidden node problem is a
   practical example of the non-transitivity of multi-hop ad hoc
   wireless communications mentioned in Section 2.1.

                    Radio Ranges for Nodes A, B, C

      <~~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~> <~~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~>
                    |<~~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~>|
                 +--|--+        +--|--+        +--|--+
                 |NodeB|=======>|NodeA|<=======|NodeC|
                 +-----+        +-----+        +-----+

      Figure 2: The hidden node problem. When nodes C and B
                try to communicate with node A at the same time,
                their radio signals collide.

   A related situation is shown in Figure 3, illustrating the "exposed
   node" problem.  In the figure, node A is transmitting (to node B).
   As shown, node C cannot communicate properly with node D, because of
   the on-going transmission of node A, in node C's radio-range.  Node C
   cannot hear D, but node D can hear C because node D is outside node
   A's radio range.  Node C is then called an "exposed node", because it
   is exposed to co-channel interference from node A and thereby
   prevented from transmitting data to node D even though the
   transmission would be successful and would not interfere with the
   reception of data sent from node A to node B.

                    Radio Ranges for Nodes A, B, C, D

   <~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~> <~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~>
                |<~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~>|<~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~>

             |NodeB|<======|NodeA|       |NodeC|======>|NodeD|
             +-----+       +-----+       +-----+       +-----+

      Figure 3: The exposed node problem. When node A is communicating
             with node B, node C is an "exposed node"

   Hidden and exposed node situations are common in multi-hop ad hoc
   wireless networks.  Problems with asymmetric links arise for reasons
   other than power inequality (e.g., multipath interference).  Such
   problems are often resolved by specific mechanisms below the IP
   layer.  However, depending on the situation and the link layer
   technology in use, such problems, and others caused by range-
   limitation and partial overlap, may affect the IP layer.

   Besides radio range limitations, wireless communications are affected
   by irregularities in the shape of the geographical area over which
   nodes may effectively communicate (see for instance [MI03]).  For
   example, even within radio range, omnidirectional wireless
   transmission area is generally far from isotropic (circular).  Nodes
   seldom hear each other perfectly, and signal strength often varies
   significantly.  The variation is not a simple function of distance,
   but rather a complex function of the environment including obstacles,
   weather conditions, interferences as well as other factors that
   change over time.  The analytical formulation of the functional
   variation is often considered intractable.

   These irregularities also cause communications on multi-hop ad hoc
   wireless networks to be non-transitive, asymmetric, or time-varying,
   as described in Section 2.1.  Just as with the problems introduced by
   limited wireless range, the irregularities of wireless communications
   often require resolution below the network (IP) layer, and yet
   nevertheless may impact the network layer.  For example, there may be

   no indication to IP when a previously established communication
   channel becomes unusable.  In other words, "link down" triggers are
   often absent in wireless systems.  This lack can potentially break
   various assumptions that have been used for features designed for
   wired communication links, and cause failures or poor performance.

3.  Alternative Terminology

   Many terms have been used in the past to describe the relationship of
   nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network based on their ability
   to send or receive packets to/from each other.  The terms used in
   this document have been selected because the authors believe (or at
   least hope) they are relatively unambiguous, with respect to the goal
   of this document (see Section 1).

   Nevertheless, here are a few other phrasings, describing the same
   relationship between wireless nodes.  In the following, let network N
   be, again, a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network.  Let the set S be, as
   before, the set of nodes that can directly receive packets
   transmitted by node A through its interface on network N. In other
   words, any node B belonging to S can "hear" packets transmitted by
   node A. Then, due to the asymmetry characteristic of wireless links:

      - We may say that node B is reachable from node A. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is reachable from
      node B, even if node B is reachable from node A.

      - We may say that node A has a link to node B. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that node B has a link to node
      A, even if node A has a link to node B.

      - We may say that node B is adjacent to node A. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is adjacent to node
      B, even if node B is adjacent to node A.

      - We may say that node B is downstream from node A. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is downstream from
      node B, even if node B is downstream from node A.

      - We may say that node B is a neighbor of node A. In this
      terminology, there is no guarantee that node A is a neighbor of
      node B, even if node B a neighbor of node A. As it happens, the
      terminology for "neighborhood" is quite confusing for asymmetric
      links.  When B can hear signals from A, but A cannot hear B, it is
      not clear whether B should be considered a neighbor of A at all,
      since A would not necessarily be aware that B was a neighbor.
      Perhaps it is best to avoid the "neighbor" terminology except for
      symmetric links.

   This list of alternative terminologies is given here for illustrative
   purposes only, and is not suggested to be complete or even
   representative of the breadth of terminologies that have been used in
   various ways to explain the properties mentioned in Section 2.
