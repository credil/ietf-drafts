		This document describes the use of the Camellia <xref target="RFC3713" /> 
		block cipher algorithm in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) 
		<xref target="RFC3711" /> for providing confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol

		Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) <xref target="RFC3550" />.

	<section title="Camellia">
		<t>
			Camellia is a symmetric cipher with a Feistel structure.  Camellia
			was developed jointly by NTT and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation in
			2000.  It was designed to withstand all known cryptanalytic attacks,
			and it has been scrutinized by worldwide cryptographic experts.
			Camellia is suitable for implementation in software and hardware,
			offering encryption speed in software and hardware implementations
			that is comparable to Advanced
			Encryption Standard (AES) <xref target="FIPS.197.2001" />.
		</t>
		<t>
			Camellia supports 128-bit block size and 128-, 192-, and 256-bit key
			lengths, i.e., the same interface specifications as the AES.
			Therefore, it is easy to implement Camellia based algorithms by replacing the AES block
			of AES based algorithms with a Camellia block.
		</t>
		<t>
			Camellia already has been adopted by the IETF and other international standardization 
			organizations; in particular, the IETF has published specifications for the use of
			Camellia with IPsec <xref target="RFC4312" />, 
			TLS <xref target="RFC4132" />, S/MIME <xref target="RFC3657" /> and 
			XML Security <xref target="RFC4051" />. 

			Camellia is one of the three ISO/IEC international standard <xref target="ISO/IEC 18033-3" />
			128-bit block ciphers (Camellia, AES, and SEED).  

			Camellia was selected as a recommended cryptographic 
			primitive by the EU NESSIE (New European Schemes for Signatures, Integrity and
			Encryption) project <xref target="NESSIE"/> and was included in the list of
			cryptographic techniques for Japanese e-Government systems that was
			selected by the Japanese CRYPTREC (Cryptography Research and Evaluation
			Committees) <xref target="CRYPTREC" />. 
		</t>
		<t>
			Since optimized source code is provided under several open source licenses
			<xref target="open source license" />, Camellia is also adopted by several open source projects (OpenSSL, GnuTLS, FreeBSD, and Linux).
			Camellia is also adopted by Mozilla and Camellia is ready for use with Firefox 3.0 released in June 2008. 
		</t>
		<t>
			The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in <xref target="RFC3713" />.
		</t>
		<t>
			The Camellia web site <xref target="Camellia web site" /> contains a wealth of information
			about Camellia, including detailed specification, security analysis,
			performance figures, reference implementation, optimized implementation, test vectors(TV), and intellectual property information.

		All symmetric block cipher algorithms share common characteristics

		Camellia algorithm is specified as well as AES, those relations are following:

		The default transforms also are mandatory-to-implement transforms in

		At the time of writing this document, there are no known weak keys

		secure against all known attacks including Differential cryptanalysis, linear 
		cryptanalysis, and related key attacks.

      	The security considerations in RFC 5289 <xref target="RFC3711" /> and Draft of

      	apply to this document as well.

	<section title="IANA Considerations">
	
	<t>
		RFC 4568 <xref target="RFC4568" /> defines SRTP "crypto suites";
		also, <xref target="AES-GCM/CCM" /> defines a crypto suite corresponds
		to a particular AEAD algorithm in SRTP.
		In order to allow SDP to signal the use of the algorithms defined in
		this document, IANA will register the following crypto suites into

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
      1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
