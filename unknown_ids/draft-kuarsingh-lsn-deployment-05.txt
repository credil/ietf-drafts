                     CGN Deployment with MPLS/VPNs
                   draft-kuarsingh-lsn-deployment-05

Abstract

   This document specifies a framework to integrate a Network Address
   Translation layer into an operator's network to function as a Carrier
   Grade NAT (also known as CGN or Large Scale NAT).  CGN is a concept
   also described in [I-D.shirasaki-nat444] which specifies NAT444 as a
   dual layer translation model.  Although operators may wish to deploy
   IPv6 to strategically overcome IPv4 exhaustion, near term needs may
   not be satisfied with an IPv6 deployment alone.  This document
   provides a practical integration model which allows CGN to be
   integrated into the network meeting the needs of the customer while
   being mindful of not disrupting existing services and meeting the
   technical challenges that CGN brings.  The model includes the use of
   MPLS/VPNs defined in [RFC4364] as a tool to achieve this goal.  This
   document does not intend to defend the merits of CGN.

Internet-Draft        CGN Deployment with MPLS/VPNs         October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Operators are faced with near term IPv4 address exhaustion
   challenges.  Many operators may not have a sufficient amount of IPv4
   addresses in the future to satisfied the needs of their growing
   customer base.  This challenge may also be present before or during
   an active transition to IPv6 somewhat complicating the overall
   problem space.

   To face this challenge, operators may need to deploy CGN (Carrier
   Grade NAT) as described in [I-D.shirasaki-nat444] to help extend the
   connectivity matrix once IPv4 addresses run out in the network.
   CGN's addition to the network requires integration in an often
   running state environment with working IPv4 and/or IPv6 services.

   The addition of the CGN introduces an operator controlled and
   administered translation layer which needs to be added in carefully
   in a manner which dose not overly disrupt existing services.  This
   addition may also include interworking in a dual stack environment
   where the IPv4 path requires translation.

   This document shows how MPLS/VPNs as described in [RFC4364] can e
   used to integrate the CGN infrastructure solving key problems faced
   by the operator.  This model has also been tested and validated in
   real production network models and allows fluid operation with
   existing IPv4 and IPv6 services.


2.  Motivation

   The selection of CGN may be made by an operator based on a number of
   factors.  The overall driver may be the depletion of IPv4 address
   pools which leaves little to no addresses for IPv4 service growth.
   Although IPv6 may be the strategic answer, it's applicability and
   usefulness in many networks is limited by the current access network
   and consumer home network.  These environments often are filled with
   IPv4-Only equipment or requires upgrades.

   The ability to replace IPv4-Only equipment may be out of the control
   of the operator, and even when it's in the administrative control; it
   poses both cost and technical challenges as operators built out
   massive programs for requirement or upgrade.  Theses issues leave an
   operator in a precarious position which may lead to the decision to
   deploy CGN.  Although other address IPv4 sharing options may exist
   which are more architecturally desirable, the practical and workable
   approach is still in many cases CGN.

   If the operator as has chosen to deploy CGN, they will which do to so

   in a manner as not to negatively impact the existing IPv4 or IPv6
   customer base.  This will include solving a number of challenges
   since customers who's connections require translation often have
   network routing and flow needs which are different from legacy IPv4
   use.

   The solution will also need to work in a dual stack environment where
   other options such as DS-Lite [RFC6333] are not viable or with
   technologies like 6RD [RFC5969] which still require an IPv4
   connectivity path.  The solution will need to address basic Internet
   connectivity, on-net service offering, back office management,
   billing, policy and security models already in place within the
   operator's network.  Other solutions may not be easily worked in as
   with CGN.


3.  CGN Network Deployment Requirements

   If a service provider is considering a CGN deployment with a provider
   NAT44 function, there are a number of basic requirements which are of
   importance.  Preliminary requirements may require the following from
   the incoming CGN system:

      - Support distributed (sparse) and centralized (dense) deployment
      models;

      - Allow co-existence with traditional IPv4 based deployments,
      which provide global scoped IPs to CPEs;

      - Provide a framework for CGN by-pass supporting non-translated
      flows between endpoints within a provider's network;

      - Provide routing framework which allows the segmentation of
      routing control and forwarding paths between CGN and non-CGN
      mediated flows;

      - Provide flexibility for operators to modify their deployments
      over time as translation demands change (connections, bandwidth,
      translation realms/zones and other vectors);

      - Flexibility should include integration options for common access
      technologies such as DSL (BRAS), DOCSIS (CMTS), Mobile (GGSN/PGW/
      ASN-GW), and Ethernet access;

      - Support deployment modes that allow for IPv4 address overlap
      within the operator's network (between various translation realms
      or zones);

      - Allow for evolution to future dual-stack and IPv4/IPv6
      transition deployment modes;

      - Transactional logging and export capabilities to support
      auxiliary functions including abuse mitigation;

      - Support for stateful connection synchronization between
      translation instances/elements (redundancy);

      - Support for ISP Shared Space [I-D.weil-shared-transition-space-
      request] deployment modes if applicable;

      - Allows for the enablement of CGN functionality (if required)
      while still minimizing costs and customer impact to the best
      extend possible;

   Other requirements may be assessed on a provider-by-provider basis,
   but those listed above should be considered for any given deployment
   architecture.

3.1.  Centralized versus Distributed Deployment

   Centralized deployments of CGN (longer proximity to end user and/or
   higher densities of subscribers/connections to CGN instances) differ
   from distributed deployments of CGN (closer proximity to end user
   and/or lower densities of subscribers/connections to CGN instances).
   Service providers will likely deploy CGN translation points more
   centrally during initial phases.  Early deployments will likely see
   light loading on these new systems since legacy IPv4 services will
   continue to operate with most endpoints using globally unique IPv4
   addresses.  Exceptional cases which may drive heavy usage in initial
   stages may include operators who already translate most IPv4 traffic
   and will migrate to a CGN implementation from legacy firewalls; or a
   green field deployment which may see quick growth in the number of
   new IPv4 endpoints which require Internet connectivity.

   Over time, most providers will likely need to expand and possibly
   distribute the translation points as demand for the CGN system
   increases.  The extent of the expansion of the CGN infrastructure
   will depend on factors such as growth in the number of IPv4
   endpoints, status of IPv6 content on the Internet and the overall
   progress globally to an IPv6 world (reducing the demand for IPv4
   connectivity).

3.2.  CGN and Traditional IPv4 Service Co-existence

   Newer CGN serviced endpoints will exist alongside endpoints served by
   traditional IPv4 global IPs.  Providers will need to rationalize



Kuarsingh & Cianfarani   Expires April 12, 2012                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        CGN Deployment with MPLS/VPNs         October 2011


   these environments since both have distinct forwarding needs.
   Traditional IPv4 services will likely require (or be best served)
   with direct forwarding towards Internet peering points while CGN
   mediated flows require access to a translator.  These or
   fundamentally two different flow needs.

   The new CGN environments should not negatively impact the existing
   IPv4 service base by forcing all traffic to translation enabled
   network points since many flows do not require translation and this
   would reduce performance of the existing flows.  This would also
   require massive scaling of the CGN which is a cost and efficiency
   concern as well.

   Traffic flow and forwarding efficiency is considered important since
   networks are under considerable demand to delivery more and more
   bandwidth without the luxury of needless inefficiencies which can be
   introduced with CGN.

3.3.  CGN By-Pass

   The CGN environment is only needed for flows with translation
   requirements.  Many flows which remain in a service provider
   environment, do not require translation.  Such services include
   operator offered DNS Services, DHCP Services, NTP Services, Web
   Caching and other services local to the operator's network.

   The operator may want to leverage opportunities to offer third
   parties a platform to also provide end device services without
   translation.  CGN By-pass can be accomplished in many ways, but a
   simplistic, deterministic and scalable model is preferred.

3.4.  Routing Plane Separation

   Many operators will want to engineer traffic separately for CGN flows
   versus flows which are part of the more traditional IPv4 environment.
   Many times the routing of these two major flow types differ,
   therefore route separation may be required.

   Routing plane separation also allows the operator to utilize other
   addressing techniques, which may not be feasible on a single routing
   plane.  Such examples include the use of overlapping private address
   space [RFC1918] or use of other IPv4 space which may overlap globally
   in inside the operator's network such as Shared CGN Space [I-D.weil-
   shared-transition-space-request].

Internet-Draft        CGN Deployment with MPLS/VPNs         October 2011


3.5.  Flexible Deployment Options

   Service providers operate complex routing environments and offer a
   variety of IPv4 based services.  Many operator environments utilize
   distributed peering infrastructures for transit and peering and these
   may span large geographical areas and regions.  A CGN solution should
   offer the operator an ability to place CGN translation points at
   various points within their network.

   The CGN deployment should also be flexible enough to change over time
   as demand for translation services increase.  In turn, the deployment
   will need to then adapt as translation demand decreases caused by the
   transition of flows to IPv6.  Translation points should be able to be
   placed and moved with as little re-engineering effort as possible
   minimizing the risks to the customer base.

   Depending on hardware capabilities, security practices and IPv4
   address availability, the translation environments my need to be
   segmented and/or grown over time to meet organic IPv4 demand growth.
   Operators will want to seek deployment models which are conducive to
   meeting these goals as well.

3.6.  IPv4 Overlap Space

   IP address overlap for CGN translation realms may be required if
   insufficient IPv4 addresses are available within the service provider
   environment to use within the CGN translation zones.  The CGN
   deployment should provide mechanisms to enable such an option if
   required.

3.7.  Transactional Logging for LSN Systems

   CGNs may require transactional logging since the source IP and
   related transport protocol information is not easily visible to
   external hosts and system.

   If needed, the CGN systems should be able to generate logs which
   identify 'internal' host parameters (i.e.  IP/Port) and associated
   them to external translated parameters imposed by the translator.
   The logged information should be stored on the CGN hardware and/or
   exported to an external system for processing.  Operators may need to
   keep track of this information (securely) to meet regulatory and/or
   legal obligations.

3.8.  Additional CGN Requirements

   Additional CGN platform (a.k.a.  LSN) requirements can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements]

Internet-Draft        CGN Deployment with MPLS/VPNs         October 2011


4.  MPLS/VPN based CGN Framework

   The MPLS/VPN [RFC4364] framework for CGN segregates the 'pre-
   translated' realms within the service provider space into layer-3
   MPLS/VPNs.  The operator can deploy a single realm for all CGN based
   flows, or can deploy multiple realms based on translation demand and
   other factors such as geographical proximity.  A realm in this model
   refers to a 'VPN' which shares a unique RD/RT combination, routing
   plane and forwarding behaviours.

   The MPLS/VPN infrastructure provides control plane and forwarding
   separation for the traditional IPv4 service environment and CGN
   environment(s).  The separation allows for routing information (such
   as default routes) to be propagated separately for these two major
   service classes.  Traffic can be efficiently routed to the Internet
   for normal flows, and routed directly to translators for CGN mediated
   flows.  Although many operators may run a "default-route-free" core,
   IPv4 flows which require translation must obviously be routed first
   to a translator, so a default route is acceptable for the pre-
   translated realms.

   The physical location of the VRF Termination point for a MPLS/VPN
   enabled CGN can vary and be located anywhere within the operator's
   network.  This model fully virtualizes the translation service from
   the base IPv4 forwarding environment which will likely carry Internet
   bound traffic.  The base IPv4 environment can continue to service
   traditional IPv4 customer flows plus post translated CGN flows.

   Figure 1 provides a view of the basic model.  The Access node
   provides CPE access to either the CGN VRF or the Global Routing
   Table, depending on whether the customer receives a private or public
   IP.  Translation mediated traffic follows an MPLS LSP which can be
   setup dynamically and can span one hop, or many hops (with not need
   for complex routing policies).  Traffic is then forwarded to the
   translator (shown below) which can be an external appliance or
   integrated into the VRF Termination (Provider Edge) router.  Once
   traffic is translated, it is forwarded to the global routing table
   for general Internet forwarding.  The Global Routing table can also
   be a separate VRF (Internet Access VPN/VRF) should the provider
   choose to implement their Internet based services in that fashion.
   The translation services are effectively overlaid onto the network,
   but are maintained within a separate forwarding and control plane.

                    Figure 1: Basic MPLS/VPN CGN Model

   If more then one VRF (translation realm) is used within the
   operator's network, each VPN instance can manage CGN flows
   independently for the respective realm.  Various redundancy models
   can be used within this architecture to support failover from one
   physical CGN hardware instance to another.  If state information
   needs to be passed or maintained between hardware instances, the
   vendor would need to enable this feature in a suitable manner.

4.1.  Service Separation

   The MPLS/VPN CGN framework supports route separation.  The
   traditional IPv4 flows can be separated at the access node (Initial
   Layer 3 service point) from those which require translation.  This
   type of service separation is possible on common technologies used
   for Internet access within many operator networks.  Service
   separation can be accomplished on common access technology including
   those used for DOCSIS (CMTS), Ethernet Access, DSL (BRAS), and Mobile
   Access (GGSN/ASN-GW) architectures.

4.2.  Internal Service Delivery

   Internal services can be delivered directly to the privately
   addressed endpoint within the CGN domain without translation.  This
   can be accomplished using direct route exchange (import/export)
   between the CGN VRFs and the Services VRFs.  The previous statement
   assumes the provider puts key services into a VRF for simple routed
   exchange.  This model allows the provider to maintain separate
   forwarding rules for translated flows, which require a pass through
   the translator to reach an external network entities, versus those
   flows which need to access internal services.  This operational
   detail can be advantageous for a number of reasons.

   First, the provider can reduce the load on the translator since
   internal services do not need to be factored into the scaling of the
   CGN hardware.  Secondly, more direct forwarding paths can be
   maintained providing better network efficiency.  Thirdly, geographic
   locations of the translators and the services infrastructure can be
   deployed in a location in an independent manner.  Additionally, the
   operator can allow CGN subject endpoints to be accessible via an
   untranslated path reducing the complexities of provider initiated
   management flows.  This last point is of key interest since NAT
   removes transparency to the end device in normal cases.

   Figure 2 below shows how internal services are provided untranslated
   since flows are sent directly from the access node to the services
   node/VRF via an MPLS LSP.  This traffic is not forwarded to the CGN
   translator and therefore is not subject to problematic behaviours
   related to NAT.  The services VRF contains routing information which
   can be "imported" into the access node VRF and the CGN VRF routing
   information can be "imported" into the Services VRF.

   This demonstrates the ability to offer CGN By-Pass in a simple and
   deterministic manner without the need of policy based routing or
   traffic engineering.

4.2.1.  Dual Stack Operation

   The MPLS/VPN CGN model can also be used in conjunction with IPv4/IPv6
   dual stack service modes.  Since many providers will use CGNs on an
   interim basis while IPv6 matures within the global Internet or due to
   technical constraints, a dual stack option is of strategic
   importance.  Operators can offer this dual stack service for both
   traditional IPv4 (global IP) endpoints and CGN mediated endpoints.

   Operators can separate the IP flows for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, or use
   other routing techniques to move IPv6 based flows towards the GRT

   (Global Routing Table or Instance) while allowing IPv4 flows to
   remain within the IPv4 CGN VRF for translator services.

   The Figure 3 below shows how IPv4 translation services can be
   provided alongside IPv6 based services.  The model shown allows the
   provider to enable CGN to manage IPv4 flows (translated) and IPv6
   flows are routed without translation efficiently towards the
   Internet.  Once again, forwarding of flows to the translator does not
   impact IPv6 flows which do not require this service.

4.3.  Deployment Flexibility

   The CGN translator services can be moved, separated or segmented (new
   translation realms) without the need to change the overall
   translation design.  Since dynamic LSPs are used to forward traffic



Kuarsingh & Cianfarani   Expires April 12, 2012                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        CGN Deployment with MPLS/VPNs         October 2011


   from the access nodes to the translation points, the physical
   location of the VRF termination points can vary and be changed
   easily.

   This type of flexibility allows the service provider to initially
   deploy more centralized translation services based on relatively low
   loading factors, and distribute the translation points over time to
   improve network traffic efficiencies and support higher translation
   load.

   Although traffic engineered paths are not required within the MPLS/
   VPN deployment model, nothing precludes an operator from using
   technologies like MPLS with Traffic Engineering [RFC3031].
   Additional routing mechanisms can be used as desired by the provider
   and can be seen as independent.  There is no specific need to
   diversify the existing infrastructure in most cases.

4.4.  Comparison of MPLS/VPN Option versus other CGN Attachment Options

   Other integration architecture options exist which can attach CGN
   based service flows to a translator instance.  Alternate options
   which can be used to attach such services include:

      - IEEE 802.1Q for direct attachment to a next hop translator;

      - Policy Based Routing (Static) to direct translation bound
      traffic to a network based translator;

      - Traffic Engineering or;

      - Multiple Routing Topologies

4.4.1.  IEEE 802.1Q

   IEEE 802.1Q can be used to associate separated traffic from the
   access node to the next hop router's CGN instance.  This technology
   option may limit the CGN placement to the next hop router unless a
   second technology option is paired with it to extend connectivity
   deeper in the network.

   This option is most effective if CGN instances are placed directly
   upstream of the access node.  Distributed CGN instance placement is
   not likely an initial stage of the CGN deployment due to cost and
   demand factors.

Internet-Draft        CGN Deployment with MPLS/VPNs         October 2011


4.4.2.  Policy Based Routing

   Policy Based Routing (PBR) provides another option to direct CGN
   mediated flows to a translator.  PBR options, although possible, are
   difficult to maintain (static policy) and must be configured
   throughout the network with considerable maintenance overhead.

   More centralized deployments may be difficult or too onerous to
   deploy using Policy Based Routing methods.  Policy Based Routing
   would not achieve route separation (unless used with others options),
   and may add complexities to the providers' routing environment.

4.4.3.  Traffic Engineering

   Traffic Engineering can also be used to direct traffic from an access
   node towards a translator.  Traffic Engineering, like MPLS-TE, may be
   difficult to setup and maintain.  Traffic Engineering provides
   additional benefits if used with MPLS by adding potentials for faster
   path re-convergence.  Traffic Engineering paths would need to be
   updated and redefined overtime as CGN translation points are
   augmented or moved.

4.4.4.  Multiple Routing Topologies

   Multiple routing topologies can be used to direct CGN based flows to
   translators.  This option would achieve the same basic goal as the
   MPLS/VPN option but with additional implementation overhead and
   platform configuration complexity.  Since operator based translation
   is expected to have an unknown lifecycle, and may see various degrees
   of demand (dependant on operator IPv4 Global space availability and
   shift of traffic to IPv6), it may be too large of an undertaking for
   the provider to enabled this as their primary option for CGN.


5.  Experiences


6.  Basic Integration and Requirements Support

   The MPLS/VPN CGN environment has been successfully integrated into
   real network environments utilizing existing network service delivery
   mechanisms.  It solves many issues related to provider based
   translation environments, while still subject to problematic
   behaviours inherent within NAT.

   Key issues which are solved or managed with the MPLS/VPN option
   include:

Internet-Draft        CGN Deployment with MPLS/VPNs         October 2011


      - Centralized and Distributed Deployment model support

      - Routing Plane Separation for CGN flows versus traditional IPv4
      flows

      - Flexible Translation Point Design (can relocate translators and
      split translation zones easily)

      - Low maintenance overhead (dynamic routing environment with
      little maintenance of separate routing infrastructure other then
      management of MPLS/VPNs)

      - CGN By-pass options (for internal and third party services which
      exist within the provider domain)

      - IPv4 Translation Realm overlap support (can reuse IP addresses
      between zones with some impact to extranet service model)

      - Simple failover techniques can be implemented with redundant
      translators, such as using a second default route


7.  Performance

   The MPLS/VPN CGN model was observed to support basic functions which
   are typically used by customers within an operator environment.
   Examples of successful operation include:

      - Traditional Web (HTTP) Surfing (client initiated)

      - Internet Video Streaming

      - HTTP Based Client Connections

      - High Connection Count sites (i.e.  Google Maps)

      - Email Transaction Support (POP, IMAP, SMTP)

      - Instant Messaging Support (Online Status, File transfers, text
      chat)

      - ICMP Operation (client initiated Echo, Traceroute)

      - Peer to Peer application support (download)

      - DNS (based on services extranet option, but was problematic when
      passed through a translator)

Internet-Draft        CGN Deployment with MPLS/VPNs         October 2011


   CGNs are still subject to problematic connectivity even within the
   MPLS/VPN technology approach.  Problems which arise, or are not
   inherently addressed in this model include:

      - Inward services from the Internet to the CPE

      - Web session tracking

      - Restricting usage and/or access based on source IP

      - Abuse mitigation (masquerade of potential offenders)

      - Increased network or server IDS false positives

      - Increased customer risk for session hijacking

      - Exceeding firewall TCP/UDP limits

      - Customer identification (external site)

      - Poor source based load balancing

      - Customer usage tracking / Ad insertion

      - Other applications or operations may be negatively impacted


8.  IANA Considerations

   There are not specific IANA considerations known at this time with
   the architecture described herein.  Should a provide choose to use
   non-assigned IP address space within their translation realms, then
   considerations may apply.


9.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations would typically exist for CGN
   deployments when compared with traditional IPv4 based services.

   If a provider plans to operation the pre-translation realm (CPE
   towards translator IPv4 zone) as a non-public like network, then
   additional security measures may be needed to secure this
   environment.

10.  Conclusions

   The MPLS/VPN delivery method for CGN is an effective and scalable way
   to delivery mass translation services.  The architecture avoids the
   complex requirements of traffic engineering and policy based routing.
   This is advantageous since the NAT44/LSN environment is expected to
   change over time and will potentially migrate to more progressive
   dual stack environments like DS-Lite over time.

   The architecture solves many of this issues related to CGN as an
   overall translation model which are of concern to large Service
   Providers.
