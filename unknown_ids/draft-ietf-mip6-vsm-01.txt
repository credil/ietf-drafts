Abstract

   There is a need for vendor specific extensions to Mobility Header
   messages so that Mobile IPv6 vendors are able to extend the protocol
   for research or deployment purposes.  This document defines a new
   vendor specific mobility option.

Internet-Draft        MIPv6 Vendor Specific Option         February 2007


1.  Introduction

   Vendor specific messages have traditionally allowed vendors to
   implement extensions to some protocols and distinguish themselves
   from other vendors.  These messages are clearly marked by a Vendor ID
   that identifies the vendor.  A particular vendor's implementation
   identifies the vendor extension by recognizing the Vendor ID.
   Implementations that do not recognize the Vendor ID either discard or
   skip processing the message.

   Mobile IPv6 [2] is being deployed and there is a need for vendor
   specific extensions to Mobility Header messages so that vendors are
   able to extend the Mobile IPv6 protocol for research or deployment
   purposes.

   This document defines a new mobility option, the Vendor Specific
   Mobility option, which can be carried in any Mobility Header message.
   The Vendor Specific mobility option MUST be used only with a Mobility
   Header message.  Mobility options, by definition, can be skipped if
   an implementation does not recognize the mobility option type [2].

   The messages defined in this document can also be used for NEMO [3]
   and Proxy MIPv6 [4] since these protocols also use Mobility Header
   messages.

   Vendor specific extensions to protocols can cause serious
   interoperability issues if they are not used carefully.  The vendor
   specific extensions MUST be standardized in the IETF if they are to
   be deployed in a large scale or if multiple vendors are involved in a
   particular system or deployment.  Experience has shown that vendor
   specific extensions benefit from IETF review and standardization.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].


3.  Vendor Specific Mobility Option

   The Vendor Specific Mobility Option can be included in any Mobility
   Header message and has an alignment requirement of 4n+2.  If the
   Mobility Header message includes a Binding Authorization Data option
   [2], then the Vendor Specific mobility option should appear before
   the Binding Authorization Data option.  Multiple Vendor Specific
   mobility options MAY be present in a Mobility Header message.

   Type

      A 8-bit field indicating that it is a Vendor Specific mobility
      option.

   Length

      A 8-bit indicating the length of the option in octets excluding
      the Type and Length fields.

   Vendor ID

      The SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Code of the Vendor/
      Organization as defined by IANA.

   Data

      Vendor specific data that is carried in this message.


4.  Security Considerations

   The Vendor Specific mobility messages should be protected in a manner
   similar to Binding Updates and Binding acknowledgements if it carries
   information that should not be revealed on the wire or that can
   affect the binding cache entry at the home agent or the correspondent
   node.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The Vendor Specific mobility option defined in Section 3, should have
   the type value allocated from the same space as Mobility Options [2].
