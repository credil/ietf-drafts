     Abstract 

        This document specifies the requirements necessary to manage the 
        elements and networks that support an MPLS Transport Profile 
        (MPLS-TP). This document is a product of a joint International 
        Telecommunications Union - Telecommunications Standardization 
        Sector (ITU-T) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) effort 
        to include a MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS 
        architecture. The requirements are driven by the management 
        functionality needs defined by ITU-T for packet transport 
        networks.

     Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements          April, 2009 
         

     1. Introduction 

        This document describes the requirements necessary to manage the 
        elements and networks that support an MPLS Transport Profile 
        (MPLS-TP).  It leverages the management requirements specified 
        in ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 [1] and RFC 4377 [2]. ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 
        [1] specifies generic management requirements for transport 
        (including packet-based and circuit-based) networks. RFC 4377 
        specifies the OAM requirements, including OAM-related network 
        management requirements, for MPLS networks. This document 
        expands on the requirements in [1] and [2] to cover fault, 
        configuration, performance, and security management for MPLS-TP 
        networks, and the requirements for object and information models 
        needed to manage MPLS-TP Networks and Network Elements. 

     1.1. Terminology 

        Although this document is not a protocol specification, the key 
        words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
        this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6] 
        and are to be interpreted as instructions to protocol designers 
        producing solutions that satisfy the requirements set out in 
        this document.   

        MPLS-TP NE: a network element (NE) that supports MPLS-TP 
        functions  

        MPLS-TP network: a network in which MPLS-TP NEs are deployed  

        Data Communication Network (DCN): a network that supports Layer 
        1 (physical layer), Layer 2 (data-link layer), and Layer 3 
        (network layer) functionality for distributed management 
        communications related to the management plane, for distributed 
        signaling communications related to the control plane, and other 
        operations communications (e.g., order-wire/voice 
        communications, software downloads, etc.).  

        Management Communication Network (MCN): A DCN supporting 
        management plane communication is referred to as a Management 
        Communication Network (MCN).  

        Signaling Communication Network (SCN): A DCN supporting control 
        plane communication is referred to as a Signaling Communication 
        Network (SCN).

     Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements          April, 2009 
         

        Communication Channel (CC): a logical channel between network 
        elements (NEs) that can be used - e.g. - for management plane 
        application or control plane applications. The physical channel 
        supporting the CC is technology specific.  See APPENDIX A:  

        Management Communication Channel (MCC): a CC dedicated for 
        management plane communications.  

        Signaling Communication Channel (SCC): a CC dedicated for 
        control plane communications. The SCC may be used for GMPLS/ASON 
        signaling and/or other control plane messages (e.g., routing 
        messages).  

        Operations System (OS): A system that performs the functions 
        that support processing of information related to operations, 
        administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P) for the 
        networks, including surveillance and testing functions to 
        support customer access maintenance. 

     2. Management Interface Requirements  

        This document does not specify which management interface 
        protocol should be the standard protocol for managing MPLS-TP 
        networks. Managing an end-to-end connection across multiple 
        operator domains where one domain is managed (for example) via 
        NETCONF/XML or SNMP/SMI, and another domain via CORBA/IDL, is 
        allowed.  

        For the management interface to the management system, an MPLS-
        TP NE MAY actively support more than one management protocol in 
        any given deployment. For example, an MPLS-TP NE may use one 
        protocol for configuration and another for monitoring. The 
        protocols to be supported are at the discretion of the operator.  

     3. Management Communication Channel (MCC) Requirements 

        An MPLS-TP management network SHOULD support seamless management 
        connectivity with remote MPLS-TP domains and NEs as well as with 
        termination points located in NEs under control by a third party 
        network operator.  See ITU-T G.8601 [8] for example scenarios in 
        multi-carrier multi-transport-technology environments. 

        For management purpose, every MPLS-TP NE MUST connect to an OS 
        either directly or indirectly via another MPLS-TP NE. When an 
        MPLS-TP NE is connected indirectly to an OS, an MCC MUST be 
        supported between the MPLS-TP NE and the other MPLS-TP NE.

     4. Management Communication Network (MCN) Requirements 

        Entities of the MPLS-TP management plane communicate via a DCN, 
        or more specifically via the MCN. The MCN connects MPLS-TP NEs 
        with management systems, NEs with NEs, and management systems 
        with management systems. Transport DCN architecture and 
        requirements are specified in ITU-T G.7712/Y.1703 [7], including 
        network layer protocols and their interworking.  

        As a practical requirement, MCN connections require addressing. 
        See the section on addressing in [13] for further information. 

        In order to have the MCN operate properly, a number of 
        management functions for the MCN are required, including: 

          . Retrieval of DCN network parameters to ensure compatible 
             functioning, e.g. packet size, timeouts, quality of 
             service, window size, etc.; 

          . Establishment of message routing between DCN nodes;  

          . Management of DCN network addresses; 

          . Retrieval of operational status of the DCN at a given node; 

          . Capability to enable/disable access to the DCN. 

     5. Fault Management Requirements 

        The Fault Management functions within an MPLS-TP NE enable the 
        supervision, detection, validation, isolation, correction, and 
        reporting of abnormal operation of the MPLS-TP network and its 
        environment. 

     5.1. Supervision Function 

        The supervision function analyses the actual occurrence of a 
        disturbance or fault for the purpose of providing an appropriate 
        indication of performance and/or detected fault condition to 
        maintenance personnel and operations systems. 

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support supervision of the OAM mechanisms 
        that are deployed for supporting the OAM requirements defined in 
        [3]. 

      
      
     Gray, et al             Expires October, 2009              [Page 5] 
         




     Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements          April, 2009 
         

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the following transmission 
        supervision functions:  

          . Supervision of looping check functions used to detect loops 
            in the data-plane forwarding path (which result in non-
            delivery of traffic, wasting of forwarding resources and 
            unintended self-replication of traffic); 

          . Supervision of the detection of failure in the sequence of 
            a protocol exchange (e.g. automatic protection switching 
            protocol); 

        The MPLS-TP NE transmission-related supervision mechanisms MUST 
        support the flexibility to be configured to perform on-demand or 
        proactively.  

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support supervision for software processing  
        e.g., processing fault, storage capacity problem, version 
        mismatch, corrupted data, out of memory, etc. 

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support hardware-related supervision for 
        interchangeable and non-interchangeable units, cable, and power 
        problem.  

        The MPLS-TP NE SHOULD support environment-related supervision 
        for temperature, humidity, etc.  

     5.2. Validation Function 

        Validation is concerned with the integration of Fault Causes 
        into Failures. A Fault Cause indicates a limited interruption of 
        the required transport function. A Fault Cause is not reported 
        to maintenance personnel because it could exist only for a very 
        short time. Note that some of these events however are summed up 
        in the Performance Monitoring process, and when this sum exceeds 
        a certain value, a Threshold Report can be generated. 

        When the Fault Cause lasts long enough, an inability to perform 
        the required transport function arises. This Failure condition 
        is subject to reporting to maintenance personnel and/or an OS 
        because corrective action might be required. Conversely, when 
        the Fault Cause ceases after a certain time, clearing of the 
        Failure condition is also subject to reporting. 

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST perform persistency checks on fault causes 
        before it declares a fault cause a failure. 

      
      
     Gray, et al             Expires October, 2009              [Page 6] 
         




     Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements          April, 2009 
         

        A transmission failure SHALL be declared if the fault cause 
        persists continuously for a configurable time (Time-D). The 
        failure SHALL be cleared if the fault cause is absent 
        continuously for a configurable time (Time-C).  Typically the 
        default time values would be as follows: 

           Time-D = 2.5 +/- 0.5 seconds 

           Time-C = 10 +/- 0.5 seconds 

        These time values are as defined in G.7710 [1]. 

        The failure declaration and clearing MUST be time stamped. The 
        time-stamp SHALL indicate the time at which the fault cause is 
        activated at the input of the fault cause persistency (i.e. 
        defect-to-failure integration) function, and the time at which 
        the fault cause is deactivated at the input of the fault cause 
        persistency function. 

     5.3. Alarm Handling Function 

     5.3.1. Alarm Severity Assignment 

        Failures might be categorized to indicate the severity or 
        urgency of the fault.  

        An MPLS-TP NE SHOULD support the flexibility of assignment of 
        severity (e.g., Critical, Major, Minor, Warning) by the 
        management system. 

        See G.7710 [1] for more description about alarm severity 
        assignment. 

     5.3.2. Alarm Suppression 

        Alarms may be generated from many sources, including OAM, device 
        status, etc. 

        An MPLS-TP NE MUST provide alarm suppression functionality that 
        prevents the generation of superfluous alarms.  

        Examples of alarm suppression mechanisms include simply 
        discarding the alarms (or not generating them in the first 
        place), or aggregating the alarms together, thereby greatly 
        reducing the number of alarm notifications to be emitted.

     Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements          April, 2009 
         

        Note: An MPLS-TP NE supporting the inter-working of one or more 
        networking technologies (e.g., Ethernet, SDH/SONET, MPLS) with 
        MPLS-TP needs to translate an MPLS-TP fault into an existing 
        transport technology failure condition for reporting to the 
        management system. 

        See RFC 4377 [2] for more description. 

     5.3.3. Alarm Reporting Control 

        Alarm Reporting Control (ARC) supports an automatic in-service 
        provisioning capability. Alarm reporting MAY be turned off on a 
        per-managed entity (e.g., LSP) basis to allow sufficient time 
        for customer service testing and other maintenance activities in 
        an "alarm free" state. Once a managed entity is ready, alarm 
        reporting is automatically turned on. 

        An MPLS-TP NE SHOULD support the Alarm Reporting Control 
        function for controlling the reporting of alarm conditions. 

        See G.7710 [1] and RFC 3878 [9] for more description of ARC.    

     5.3.4. Alarm Reporting 

        Alarm Reporting is concerned with the reporting of relevant 
        events and conditions, which occur in the network (including the 
        NE, incoming signal, and external environment). 

        Local reporting is concerned with automatic alarming by means of 
        audible and visual indicators near the failed equipment.  

        An MPLS-TP NE MUST support local reporting of alarms. 

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support reporting of alarms to an OS. These 
        reports are either autonomous reports (notifications) or reports 
        on request by maintenance personnel. The MPLS-TP NE SHOULD 
        report local (environmental) alarms to a network management 
        system. 

     6. Configuration Management Requirements 

        Configuration Management provides functions to identify, collect 
        data from, provide data to and control NEs.  Specific 
        configuration tasks requiring network management support include 
        hardware and software configuration, configuration of NEs to 
        support transport paths (including required working and

     Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements          April, 2009 
         

        protection paths), and configuration of required path 
        integrity/connectivity and performance monitoring (i.e. - OAM). 

     6.1. System Configuration 

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the configuration requirements 
        specified in G.7710 [1] for hardware, software, and date/time. 

     6.2. Control Plane Configuration 

        If a control plane is supported in an implementation of MPLS-TP, 
        the MPLS-TP NE MUST support the configuration of MPLS-TP control 
        plane functions by the management plane. Further detailed 
        requirements might be provided along with progress in defining 
        the MPLS-TP control plane in appropriate specifications. 

     6.3. Path Configuration 

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the capability of configuring 
        required path performance characteristic thresholds (e.g. - Loss 
        Measurement [LM], Delay Measurement [DM] thresholds). 

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the capability of configuring 
        required LSPs as follows: 

            . configure LSP indentifier and/or other information 
               necessary to retrieve LSP status information. 
         
     6.4. Protection Configuration 

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the capability of configuring 
        required path protection as follows: 

            . Designate specifically identified LSPs as working or 
               protection LSPs; 
            . define associations of working and protection paths; 
            . operate/release manual protection switching; 
            . operate/release force protection switching; 
            . operate/release protection lockout; 
            . set/retrieve Automatic Protection Switching (APS) 
               parameters, including -  
                 . Wait to Restore time, 
                 . Protection Switching threshold information.

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST provide the capability to configure the OAM 
        entities and functions specified in [3]. 

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the capability to choose which OAM 
        functions to use and which maintenance entity to apply them.   

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the capability to configure the OAM 
        entities/functions as part of LSP setup and tear-down, including 
        co-routed bidirectional point-to-point, associated bidirectional 
        point-to-point, and uni-directional (both point-to-point and 
        point-to-multipoint) connections.  

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the configuration of maintenance 
        entity identifiers (e.g. MEP ID and MIP ID) for the purpose of 
        LSP connectivity checking.  

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST have the flexibility to configure OAM 
        parameters to meet their specific operational requirements, such 
        as whether (1) one-time on-demand immediately or (2) one-time 
        on-demand pre-scheduled or (3) on-demand periodically based on a 
        specified schedule or (4) proactive on-going.  

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support the enabling/disabling of the 
        connectivity check processing. The connectivity check process of 
        the MPLS-TP NE MUST support provisioning of the identifiers to 
        be transmitted and the expected identifiers. 

     7. Performance Management Requirements 

        Performance Management provides functions to evaluate and report 
        upon the behavior of the equipment, NE, and network for the 
        purpose of Maintenance, Bring-into-service, Quality of service, 
        and Performance monitoring for signal degradation. ITU-T 
        Recommendation G.7710 [1] provides transport performance 
        monitoring requirements for packet-switched and circuit-switched 
        transport networks with the objective of providing coherent and 
        consistent interpretation of the network behavior, in particular 
        for hybrid network which consists of multiple transport 
        technologies. The performance management requirements specified 
        in this document are driven by such an objective. 

     7.1. Path Characterization Performance Metrics 

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support collection of loss measurement (LM) 
        so that they can be used to detect performance degradation.

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support collection of delay measurement (DM) 
        so that they can be used to detect performance degradation. 

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support reporting of Performance degradation 
        via fault management for corrective actions (e.g. protection 
        switching). 

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support collection of loss ratio measurement 
        so that they can be used to determine Severely Errored Second 
        (SES). 

        A SES is declared for a one second interval when the ratio of 
        lost packets to total transmitted packets in that one second 
        interval exceeds a predetermined threshold. 

        The packet lost threshold for declaring SES MUST be 
        configurable. 

        The number of SESs MUST be collected per configurable intervals 
        (e.g. 15-minute and 24-hour). 

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support collection of SES measurement so 
        that they can be used to determine service unavailable time. 

        A period of unavailable time (UAT) begins at the onset of 10 
        consecutive SES events. These 10 seconds are considered to be 
        part of unavailable time. A new period of available time begins 
        at the onset of 10 consecutive non-SES events. These 10 seconds 
        are considered to be part of available time.  

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support collection of Unavailable Seconds 
        (UAS) so that they can be used to determine service 
        availability. 

        The number of UAS MUST be collected per configurable intervals 
        (e.g. 15-minute and 24-hour). 

        SES and UAS history (the number of readings to be retained and 
        available) is as defined in ITU and ANSI documents associated 
        with specific transport technologies (for instance, ITU-T 
        G.7710, and ANSI T1.231-2003 [T1.231.01-2003 for DSL,.02 for 
        DS1,.03 for DS3 and T1.231.04-2003 for SONET] - see [1] and [14] 
        respectively), however these are fairly consistently defined as 
        follows: 

          - Current and previous 1-day statistics

     Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements          April, 2009 
         

          - Current and 16 recent 15-minute statistics (ITU-T) 

          - Current, previous and 31 recent 15-minute statistics (ANSI)  

        Note that - worst case (ANSI) requires 2 copies of 1-day 
        statistics (current and previous) and 33 copies of 15-minute 
        statistics (current, previous and 31 recent). 

     7.2. Performance Measurement Instrumentation 

     7.2.1. Measurement Frequency 

        The performance measurement mechanisms MUST support the 
        flexibility to be configured to operate on-demand or proactively 
        (i.e. continuously over a period of time).  

     7.2.2. Measurement Scope 

        On measurement of packet loss and loss ratio: 

          - For bidirectional (both co-routed and associated) P2P 
             connections -  

                 . on-demand measurement of single-ended packet loss, 
                    and loss ratio, measurement are required; 

                 . proactive measurement of packet loss, and loss 
                    ratio, measurement for each direction are required. 

        Note: for associated bidirectional P2P connections, this data 
        can only be measured at end-points. 

          - For unidirectional (P2P and P2MP) connection, proactive 
             measurement of packet loss, and loss ratio, are required. 

        On Delay measurement:  

          - For unidirectional (P2P and P2MP) connection, on-demand 
             measurement of delay measurement is required. 

          - For co-routed bidirectional (P2P) connection, on-demand 
             measurement of one-way and two-way delay are required.  

          - For associated bidirectional (P2P) connection, on-demand 
             measurement of one-way delay is required.

     8. Security Management Requirements 

        The MPLS-TP NE MUST support secure management and control 
        planes. 

     8.1. Management Communication Channel Security 

        Secure channels MUST be provided for all network traffic and 
        protocols used to support management functions.  This MUST 
        include, at least, protocols used for configuration, monitoring, 
        configuration backup, logging, time synchronization, 
        authentication, and routing.  The MCC MUST support application 
        protocols that provide confidentiality and data integrity 
        protection.   

        If management communication security is provided, the MPLS-TP NE 
        MUST support the following: 

          - Use of open cryptographic algorithms (See RFC 3871 [5])  

          - Authentication - allow management connectivity only from 
             authenticated entities. 

          - Authorization - allow management activity originated by an 
             authorized entity, using (for example) an Access Control 
             List (ACL). 

        Port Access Control - allow management activity received on an 
        authorized (management) port. 

     8.2.Signaling Communication Channel Security 

        Security considerations for the SCC are similar to the 
        considerations driving the requirements described in section 
        8.1. Security Requirements for the control plane are out of 
        scope for this document and are expected to be defined in the 
        appropriate control plane specifications. Management of the 
        control plane security must also be defined at that time. 

     8.3. Distributed Denial of Service 

        Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attack which tries to 
        prevent a target from performing an assigned task, or providing 
        its intended service(s), through any means. A Distributed DoS 
        (DDoS) can multiply attack severity (possibly by an arbitrary 
        amount) by using multiple (potentially compromised) systems to 
        act as topologically (and potentially geographically)

     Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements          April, 2009 
         

        distributed attack sources. It is possible to lessen the impact 
        and potential for DDOS by using secure protocols, turning off 
        unnecessary processes, logging and monitoring, and ingress 
        filtering.  RFC 4732 [4] provides background on DOS in the 
        context of the Internet. 

     9. Security Considerations 

        Section 8 includes a set of security requirements that apply to 
        MPLS-TP network management. 

        Solutions MUST provide mechanisms to prevent unauthorized and/or 
        unauthenticated access to private information by network     
        elements, systems or users. 

        Performance of diagnostic functions and path characterization 
        involves extracting a significant amount of information about 
        network construction that the network operator MAY consider 
        private. 

     10. IANA Considerations 

        There are no IANA actions associated with this document.

     APPENDIX A: Communication Channel (CC) Examples 

        A CC may be realized in a number of ways. 

        1. The CC may be provided by a link in a physically distinct 
        network.  That is, a link that is not part of the transport 
        network that is being managed. For example, the nodes in the 
        transport network may be interconnected in two distinct physical 
        networks: the transport network and the DCN. 

        This is a "physically distinct out-of-band CC". 

        2. The CC may be provided by a link in the transport network 
        that is terminated at the ends of the DCC and which is capable 
        of encapsulating and terminating packets of the management 
        protocols.  For example, in MPLS-TP an single-hop LSP might be 
        established between two adjacent nodes, and that LSP might be 
        capable of carrying IP traffic. Management traffic can then be 
        inserted into the link in an LSP parallel to the LSPs that carry 
        user traffic. 

        This is a "physically shared out-of-band CC." 

        3. The CC may be supported as its native protocol on the 
        interface alongside the transported traffic. For example, if an 
        interface is capable of sending and receiving both MPLS-TP and 
        IP, the IP-based management traffic can be sent as native IP 
        packets on the interface. 

        This is a "shared interface out-of-band CC". 

        4. The CC may use overhead bytes available on a transport 
        connection. For example, in TDM networks there are overhead 
        bytes associated with a data channel, and these can be used to 
        provide a CC. It is important to note that the use of overhead 
        bytes does not reduce the capacity of the associated data 
        channel. 

        This is an "overhead-based CC". 

        This alternative is not available in MPLS-TP because there is no 
        overhead available. 

        5. The CC may provided by a dedicated channel associated with 
        the data link. For example, the generic associated label (GAL) 
        [15] may be used to label DCC traffic being exchanged on a data 

      
      
     Gray, et al             Expires October, 2009             [Page 18] 
         





     Internet-Draft         MPLS-TP NM Requirements          April, 2009 
         

        link between adjacent transport nodes, potentially in the 
        absence of any data LSP between those nodes. 

        This is a "data link associated CC". 

        It is very similar to case 2, and by its nature can only span a 
        single hop in the transport network. 

        6. The CC may be provided by a dedicated channel associated with 
        a data channel. For example, in MPLS-TP the GAL [15] may be 
        imposed under the top label in the label stack for an MPLS-TP 
        LSP to create a channel associated with the LSP that may carry 
        management traffic. This CC requires the receiver to be capable 
        of demultiplexing management traffic from user traffic carried 
        on the same LSP by use of the GAL. 

        This is a "data channel associated CC". 

        7. The CC may be provided by mixing the management traffic with 
        the user traffic such that is indistinguishable on the link 
        without deep-packet inspection. In MPLS-TP this could arise if 
        there is a data-carrying LSP between two nodes, and management 
        traffic is inserted into that LSP. This approach requires that 
        the termination point of the LSP is able to demultiplex the 
        management and user traffic. Such might be possible in MPLS-TP 
        if the MPLS-TP LSP was carrying IP user traffic. 

        This is an "in-band CC". 

        These realizations may be categorized as: 

          A. Out-of-fiber, out-of-band (types 1 and 2) 
          B. In-fiber, out-of-band (types 2, 3, 4, and 5) 
          C. In-band (types 6 and 7) 

        The MCN and SCN are logically separate networks and may be 
        realized by the same DCN or as separate networks. In practice, 
        that means that, between any pair of nodes, the MCC and SCC may 
        be the same link or separate links. 

        It is also important to note that the MCN and SCN do not need to 
        be categorised as in-band, out-of-band, etc. This definition 
        only applies to the individual links, and it is possible for 
        some nodes to be connected in the MCN or SCN by one type of 
        link, and other nodes by other types of link. Furthermore, a

        pair of adjacent nodes may be connected by multiple links of 
        different types. 

        Lastly note that the division of DCN traffic between links 
        between a pair of adjacent nodes is purely an implementation 
        choice. Parallel links may be deployed for DCN resilience or 
        load sharing. Links may be designated for specific use. For 
        example, so that some links carry management traffic and some 
        carry control plane traffic, or so that some links carry 
        signaling protocol traffic while others carry routing protocol 
        traffic. 

        It should be noted that the DCN may be a routed network with 
        forwarding capabilities, but that this is not a requirement. The 
        ability to support forwarding of management or control traffic 
        within the DCN may substantially simplify the topology of the 
        DCN and improve its resilience, but does increase the complexity 
        of operating the DCN.

        GR-833-CORE [12] for further information.
