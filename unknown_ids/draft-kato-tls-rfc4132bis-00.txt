Internet-Draft       Camellia Cipher Suites for TLS            July 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC4346] protocol to support the
   Camellia encryption algorithm as a block cipher algorithm.

   Camellia is a symmetric cipher with a Feistel structure.  Camellia
   was developed jointly by NTT and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation in
   2000.  It was designed to withstand all known cryptanalytic attacks,
   and it has been scrutinized by worldwide cryptographic experts.
   Camellia is suitable for implementation in software and hardware,
   offering encryption speed in software and hardware implementations
   that is comparable to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
   [FIPS.197.2001].

   Camellia supports 128-bit block size and 128-, 192-, and 256-bit key
   lengths, i.e., the same interface specifications as the AES.
   Therefore, it is easy to implement Camellia based algorithms by
   replacing the AES block of AES based algorithms with a Camellia
   block.

   Camellia already has been adopted by the IETF and other international
   standardization organizations; in particular, the IETF has published
   specifications for the use of Camellia with IPsec [RFC4312], TLS
   [RFC4132], S/MIME [RFC3657] and XML [RFC4051].  Camellia is one of
   the three ISO/IEC international standard [ISO/IEC 18033-3] 128-bit
   block ciphers (Camellia, AES, and SEED).  Camellia was selected as a
   recommended cryptographic primitive by the EU NESSIE (New European
   Schemes for Signatures, Integrity and Encryption) project [NESSIE]
   and was included in the list of cryptographic techniques for Japanese
   e-Government systems that was selected by the Japanese CRYPTREC
   (Cryptography Research and Evaluation Committees) [CRYPTREC].

   Since optimized source code is provided under several open source
   licenses [open source license], Camellia is also adopted by several
   open source projects (OpenSSL, FreeBSD, and Linux).  Camellia is also
   adopted by Mozilla and Camellia is ready for use with Firefox 3.0
   released in June 2008.

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [RFC3713]

   The Camellia web site [Camellia web site] contains a wealth of
   information about Camellia, including detailed specification,
   security analysis, performance figures, reference implementation,
   optimized implementation, test vectors(TV), and intellectual property
   information.

2.  Proposed Cipher Suites

   The cipher suites proposed here have the following definitions:

  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA         = { 0x00,0x41 };

  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256 = { TBD,TBD };

  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256      = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256   = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256   = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256  = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256  = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256 = { TBD,TBD };


3.  Cipher Suite Definitions

3.1.  Key Exchange

   The cipher suites defined here differ in the type of certificate and
   key exchange method.  They use the following options:

Internet-Draft       Camellia Cipher Suites for TLS            July 2008


      Indicator of
      Cipher Suite          Key Exchange Algorithm

      RSA                   RSA
      DH_DSS                DH_DSS
      DH_RSA                DH_RSA
      DHE_DSS               DHE_DSS
      DHE_RSA               DHE_RSA
      DH_anon               DH_anon

   For the meanings of the terms RSA, DH_DSS, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DHE_RSA,
   and DH_anon, please refer to section 7.4.2. of [RFC4346].

3.2.  Cipher

   The cipher suites defined here and key sizes.  They use the following
   options:

    Indicator of            Key       Expanded     Effective IV    Block
    Cipher Suite     Type   Material  Key Material Key Bits  Size  Size

    CAMELLIA_128_CBC Block  16        16           128       16    16
    CAMELLIA_256_CBC Block  32        32           256       16    16

3.3.  MAC

   The cipher suites defined here uses different type of hash functions
   for calucuret MAC.  They use the following options:

         Indicator of
         Cipher Suite         MAC             PRF

         SHA                  HMAC-SHA-1      P_SHA-256
         SHA256               HMAC-SHA-256    P_SHA-256

   TLS1.1 or earlier versions uses SHA-1/MD5 combination for PRF.  When
   server and client select cipher suites indicated by SHA in TLS1.1 or
   earlier versions, PRF MUST be calclated by TLS1.1 or earlier versions
   manner.

   Ciphersuite indicated by SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512 MUST NOT be
   negotiated by TLS1.1 or earlier versions.  Clients MUST NOT offer
   cipher suites indicated by SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512 if they do not
   offer TLS 1.2 or later.  Servers which select an earlier version of
   TLS MUST NOT select one of cipher suites indicated by SHA256, SHA384
   and SHA512.

   Because TLS has no way for the client to indicate that it supports

   TLS 1.2 but not earlier, a non-compliant server might potentially
   negotiate TLS 1.1 or earlier and select one of the cipher suites in
   this document.  Clients MUST check the TLS version and generate a
   fatal "illegal_parameter" alert if they detect an incorrect version.


4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the following values for these cipher suites:

  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA         = { 0x00,0x41 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x42 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x43 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA     = { 0x00,0x44 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA     = { 0x00,0x45 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA     = { 0x00,0x46 };

  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA         = { 0x00,0x84 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x85 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x86 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA     = { 0x00,0x87 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA     = { 0x00,0x88 };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA     = { 0x00,0x89 };

  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256      = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256   = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256   = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256  = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256  = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256 = { TBD,TBD };

  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256      = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256   = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256   = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256  = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256  = { TBD,TBD };
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA256 = { TBD,TBD };


5.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document, there are no known weak keys
   for Camellia.

5.1.  Downgrade Attack

   TLS negotiation is only as secure as the weakest cipher suite that is
   supported.  For instance, an implementation which supports both 160-

   bit and 256-bit elliptic curves can be subject to an active downgrade
   attack to the 160-bit security level.  An attacker who can attack
   that can then forge the Finished handshake check and successfully
   mount a man-in-the-middle attack.
