    <abstract>
      <t>Existing benchmarking methodologies are based on the assumption that
      networking devices will impartially drop network traffic at their performance 
      limits.  Data Center Bridging (DCB) devices, however, will attempt to
      throttle prioritized traffic from network endpoints before those limits are
      reached in order to minimize the probability of frame loss for high value
      traffic.  Hence, existing methodologies based around indiscriminate frame
      loss are inappropriate for DCB devices.  This document takes the basic
      benchmarking ideas based on loss and extends them to support
      "lossless" Ethernet devices.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document is intended to provide a methodology for benchmarking Data
      Center Bridging (DCB) devices that support Priority-based Flow Control (PFC).
      It extends the methodologies already defined in <xref target='RFC2544'/>
      and <xref target='RFC2889'/>.</t>

      <t>This memo primarily deals with devices which use Priority-based Flow Control, as
      defined in IEEE specification 802.1Qbb, to actively manage the transmission rate of
      multiple classes of traffic in order to minimize forwarding delay and frame loss for
      high priority traffic.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Requirements">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
      NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>As the terminology used by <xref target="RFC4689"/> is specific to IP layer
      testing, a number of existing terms require clarification when used in the DCB
      benchmarking context.  Additionally, a number of new terms are also presented to
      clarify concepts not clearly defined within the scope of <xref target="RFC4689"/>.
      <list style='empty'>
        <t>Classification:  As stated in <xref target="RFC4689"/>, Classification is
        the selection of packets according to
        defined rules. In the context of DCB benchmarking, the Classification criterion is
        the value of the 802.1p priority code point field in the 802.1Q VLAN header of an
        Ethernet frame.</t>
        <t>Classification Group:  A collection of traffic streams that belong to a single
        Classification.  A Conformance Vector MAY be associated with a Classification Group.</t>
        <t>Classification Profile:  The set of all Classification Groups involved in
        a benchmarking test.</t>
        <t>Conformance Vector: A set of measurable stream result bounds, 
        e.g. latency, jitter, sequencing, etc.,
        that specify whether a frame is Conformant or Non-conformant.  Conformance vectors
        are optional for all DCB benchmarking tests.</t>
        <t>Congestion Management:  In the context of DCB benchmarking, Congestion Management
        occurs when the DUT/SUT transmits Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) Pause frames.</t>
        <t>Forwarding Congestion:  In the context of DCB benchmarking, Forwarding Congestion
        is extended to include the observation of PFC pause frame transmissions from the DUT.</t>
        <t>Intended Load:  In this document, the Intended Load refers
        to the summation of the Intended Vectors for all Classification Groups.</t>
        <t>Offered Load:  In this document, the Offered Load refers
        to the summation of the Offered Vectors for all Classification Groups.</t>
        <t>Queue Congestion:  Queue congestion occurs when a DUT/SUT uses Congestion Management
        on a set of traffic Classifications.  The congestion Classifications correspond to
        the congested queues in the DUT/SUT.</t>
        <t>Queueput: The maximum Offered Load than can be transmitted into a DUT/SUT
        such that every transmitted frame matches a specific Classification rule, 
        the DUT/SUT does NOT use priority-based flow control mechanisms to manage the ingress traffic rate
        of the Classification(s) of interest,
        and all ingress frames are forwarded to the correct egress port.  A DUT may have
        a different Queueput value for each configured Classification.</t>
        <t>XOFF Frame: A Priority-based flow control pause frame that instructs the DUT to pause
        one or more VLAN priorities.</t>
        <t>XON Frame: A Priority-based flow control pause frame that instructs the DUT to
        resume transmission on one or more VLAN priorities.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      
    </section>
    <section title="General Considerations">
      <section title="Classifications">
        <t>Data Center Bridging devices SHOULD be tested with multiple Classifications.  Testing
        with a single Classification provides no means to test and measure a device's ability to 
        differentiate forwarding behavior for different traffic classes.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Congestion">
        <t>For devices capable of forwarding traffic at line rate, explicit congestion MUST be
        created via the test tool in order to benchmark queue performance.  Possible methods
        for accomplishing this on a DUT with n ports include, but are not limited to:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Test full-mesh traffic patterns on (n-1) ports while using 1 port as a multicast 
          transmitter with (n-1) multicast receivers.</t>
          <t>Test full-mesh traffic patterns on (n-1) ports while generating partially meshed traffic
          between 1 and (n-1) ports.</t>
          <t>Use partially meshed traffic patterns with x ports transmitting to y ports where x > y and
          x + y = n.</t>
        </list>
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Test Traffic">
        <t>The lock-step traffic pattern, as described in section 5.1.3 of
        <xref target="RFC2889"/>, is specifically NOT required for DCB testing for two reasons:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Such patterns are not meaningful for high speed Ethernet devices due to the transmission 
          clock variance allowed by the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet specification.</t>
          <t>Flow control mechanisms would quickly break such patterns when activated.</t>
        </list>
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Tester Capabilities">
        <section anchor="frame_formats" title="Frame Formats">
          <t>This testing document does not mandate the use of any particular frame format
          for testing.  Any frame that can be legally forwarded by the DUT/SUT MAY be used
          provided that the test instrument can make the following distinctions for each frame:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>The test tool MUST be able to distinguish test frames from non-test frames.</t>
            <t>The test tool MUST be able to determine whether each test frame is forwarded to the
            correct egress port.</t>
            <t>The test tool MUST be able to determine whether each received frame conforms
            or does not conform to the Conformance Vector of the frame's Classification Group,
            if applicable.</t> 
          </list>
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Pause Response Time">
          <t>In order to accurately measure the performance of a Priority-based Flow Control capable
          DUT, the test tool MUST be able to respond to PFC pause frames.
          Additionally, the test tool MUST respond to all received pause frames in the time period
          specified in the IEEE 802.1Qbb specification.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Test Setup">
      <t>This document extends the general test setup described in section 3 of <xref target="RFC2889"/>
      and section 6 of <xref target="RFC2544"/> to the benchmarking of Data Center Ethernet
      switching devices. <xref target="RFC2889"/> and <xref target="RFC2544"/> describe
      benchmarking methodologies for networking devices that intentionally drop frames at their
      performance limits.  In DCB networks, the DUT will transmit PFC Pause frames as a
      Congestion Management method
      to throttle network endpoints, thus minimizing the probability of
      frame loss in the network.</t>

      <section title="Test Traffic">

        <section title="Traffic Classification">
          <t>Since DCB devices are expected to support multiple traffic Classifications,
          it is RECOMMENDED to benchmark DCB devices with multiple Classification Groups.</t>
        </section>
        
        <section title="Trial Duration">
          <t>The RECOMMENDED trial duration is 300 seconds. However other durations MAY
          be used.  Additionally, a running trial MAY be aborted once the test tool determines
          that the currently running trial has failed, e.g. QoS bounds exceeded, packet loss
          detected on a lossless queue, etc.</t>
        </section> 

        <section title="Frame Measurements">
          <t>Packet Conformance MUST be determined for all test frames on a per frame basis. 
          The method specified
          for measuring Latency in <xref target="RFC2544"/>, e.g. measuring the latency of
          a single test frame in a traffic flow, is unsuitable for
          DCB benchmarking.</t>
          <section title="Forwarding Delay and Latency">
            <t>Multiple methods exist for measuring the time it takes a test frame to
            be forwarded by a DUT.  However, both of the methods discussed in 
            <xref target="RFC1242"/> are unsuitable for testing DCB devices, as many DCB
            devices alternate between both "store and forward" and "bit forwarding"
            behavior depending upon their queue congestion.  Hence, the only RECOMMENDED
            method for measuring the time it takes a DUT to forward a test frame is
            "Forwarding Delay" as described in <xref target="RFC4689"/>.</t>
          </section>
        </section>
        
        <section anchor='frame_sizes' title="Frame Sizes">
          <section title="Ethernet">
            <t>The recommended frame sizes for Ethernet testing are 64, 128,
            256, 512, 1024, 1280, 1518, 4096, 8192, and 9216 as per <xref target="RFC5180"/>.
            Note that these frame sizes include the Ethernet CRC and VLAN header.</t>
            <section title="Fiber Channel over Ethernet">
              <t>FCoE test traffic introduces a number of frame size constraints that make the default
              frame sizes specified in <xref target="RFC5180"/> unusable:
              <list style="numbers">
                <t>FCoE frames contain an encapsulated Fiber Channel frame.  Due to the method of
                encapsulation used, all FCoE frames MUST be a multiple of 4 bytes.  See <xref target="RFC3643"/>.</t>
                <t>Test tools may need to include a test payload in addition to the encapsulated 
                Fiber Channel frame in order to meet the requirements
                specified in <xref target="frame_formats"/>.</t>
                <t>The maximum supported frame size for FCoE is 2176 bytes.</t>
              </list></t>
              <t>Due to these constraints, the recommended frame sizes for FCoE testing are
              128, 256, 512, 1024, 1280, 1520, 2176, and the smallest FCoE frame size
              supported by the test tool.  Note that these frame sizes include both the Ethernet CRC and
              VLAN header.</t>

        </section>
        
        <section anchor='burst_sizes' title="Burst Sizes">
          <t>As per <xref target="RFC2285"/>, the burst size specifies the number of test frames 
          in a burst.  To simulate bursty traffic, the test tool MAY send a burst of test traffic
          with the minimum, legal Inter-Frame Gap (IFG) between frames in the burst followed by a larger 
          Inter-Burst Gap (IBG) between sequential bursts.  Note that burst sizes are only
          applicable to test traffic when the Offered Load of the test ports is less than the 
          Maximum Offered Load (MOL) of those ports.  Additionally, a burst size of 1 specifies
          a constant load, e.g. non-bursty traffic.</t>
