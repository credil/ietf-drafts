    RPL Option for Carrying RPL Information in Data-Plane Datagrams
                      draft-hui-6man-rpl-option-00

Abstract

   The RPL protocol requires data-plane datagrams to carry RPL routing
   information that is processed by RPL routers when forwarding those
   datagrams.  This document describes the RPL option for use within a
   RPL domain.

Internet-Draft                 RPL Option                     March 2010


1.  Introduction

   RPL is a distance vector IPv6 routing protocol designed for low power
   and lossy networks [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].  Such networks are typically
   constrained in energy and/or channel capacity.  To conserve precious
   resources, a routing protocol must generate control traffic
   sparingly.  However, this is at odds with the need to quickly
   propagate any new routing information to resolve routing
   inconsistencies quickly.

   To help minimize resource consumption, RPL uses a slow proactive
   process to construct and maintain a routing topology but a reactive
   and dynamic approach to resolving routing inconsistencies.  In the
   steady state, RPL maintains the routing topology using a low-rate
   beaconing process.  However, when RPL detects inconsistencies that
   may prevent proper datagram delivery, RPL temporarily increases the
   beacon rate to quickly resolve those inconsistencies.  Such a dynamic
   rate of control packets operation is governed by the use of dynamic
   timers also referred to as "trickle" timers and defined in
   [I-D.levis-roll-trickle].  By contrast with other routing protocols
   such as OSPF ([RFC2328]), RPL detects routing inconsistencies using
   data-path verification, by including routing information within the
   datagram itself.  Data-path verification quickly detects and resolves
   inconsistencies when routes are needed by the data flow itself.  In
   doing so, repair mechanisms operate only as needed, allowing the
   control and data planes to operate on similar time scales.  The main
   motivation for data path verification in Low power and Lossy Networks
   (LLNs) is that control plane traffic should be carefully bounded with
   respect to the data traffic: there is no need to solve a routing
   issues (which may be temporary) in the absence of data traffic.

   The RPL protocol constructs a DAG that attempts to minimize path
   costs to the DAG root according to a set of metric and objective
   functions.  There are circumstances where loops may occur, and RPL is
   designed to use a data-path loop detection method.  This is one of
   the known requirements of RPL and other data-path usage might be
   defined in the future.

   To that end, this document proposes a new IPv6 option called the RPL
   Option to be carried within the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop header.  The RPL
   Option is for use only within a RPL domain.  Routers on the edge of
   the domain MAY insert the RPL Option into datagrams entering the RPL
   domain but MUST remove the RPL Option from datagrams exiting the RPL
   domains, if one exists.

Internet-Draft                 RPL Option                     March 2010


1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Format of the RPL Option

   The RPL option is carried in an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options header,
   immediately following the IPv6 header.  The RPL option has the
   following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
                                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                     |  Option Type  |  Opt Data Len |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                         (sub-TLVs)                            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                           Figure 1: RPL Option

   The Option Data of the RPL option is expected to change en-route.
   Nodes that do not understand the RPL option MUST skip over this
   option and continue processing the header.  Thus, according to
   [RFC2460] the two high order bits of the Option Type must be equal
   set to zero and the third bit is equal to 1.  The RPL Option Data
   Length is variable.

   The action taken by using the RPL Option and the potential set of
   sub-TLVs carried within the RPL Option MUST be specified by the RFC
   of the protocol that use that option.  No TLVs are currently defined.


3.  Usage of the RPL Option

   The RPL option is only for use within a RPL domain.  RPL routers MUST
   process and include the RPL option when forwarding datagrams to other
   nodes within the RPL domain.  Routers on the edge of a RPL domain
   MUST remove the RPL option when forwarding datagrams to nodes outside
   the RPL domain.  The final destination of the datagram MAY ignore the
   RPL option.


4.  Acknowledgements

5.  IANA Considerations

   The RPL option requires an IPv6 Option Number.


   HEX         act  chg  rest
   ---         ---  ---  -----
     1          00    1  01011


   The first two bits indicate that the IPv6 node may skip over this
   option and continue processing the header if it doesn't recognize the
   option type, and the third bit indicates that the Option Data may
   change en-route.


6.  Security Considerations

   This option may be used a several potential attacks since routers may
   be flooded by bogus datagram containing the RPL option.  It is thus
   RECOMMENDED for routers to implement a rate limiter for datagrams
   using the RPL option.
