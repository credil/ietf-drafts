Abstract 
    
   To facilitate the establishment of Label Switched Paths (LSP) that 
   would span multiple IGP areas in a given Autonomous System (AS), this 
   document proposes a new optional label mapping procedure for the 
   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP). 
    
   This procedure allows the use of a label if the Forwarding 
   Equivalence Class (FEC) Element matches an entry in the routing table 
   (RIB). Matching is defined by an IP longest match search and does not 
   mandate an exact match.

   Link state IGPs such as OSPF [OSPFv2] and IS-IS [IS-IS] allow the 
   partition of an autonomous system into areas or levels so as to 
   increase routing scalability within a routing domain. 
    
   However, [LDP] requires that the IP address of the FEC Element should 
   *exactly* match an entry in the IP RIB: according to [LDP] section

Internet Draft     LDP extensions for Inter-Area LSP      February 2008 
 
 
   3.5.7.1 (Label Mapping Messages Procedures) "An LSR receiving a Label 
   Mapping message from a downstream LSR for a Prefix or Host Address 
   FEC Element should not use the label for forwarding unless its 
   routing table contains an entry that exactly matches the FEC 
   Element". 
    
   Therefore, MPLS LSPs between LERs in different areas/levels are not 
   setup unless the exact (/32 for IPv4) loopback addresses of all the 
   LERs are redistributed across all areas. 
    
   The problem statement is discussed in section 4. Then, in section 5 
   we extend the Label Mapping Procedure defined in [LDP] so as to 
   support the setup of contiguous inter-area LSPs while maintaining IP 
   prefix aggregation on the ABRs. This basically consists of allowing 
   for "Longest Match Based" Label Mapping. 
    
4.      Problem statement 
    
   Provider based MPLS VPN networks are expanding with the success of 
   Layer 3 VPN ([L3-VPN]) and the new deployments of layer 2 VPNs 
   ([VPLS-BGP], [VPLS-LDP]). Service Provider MPLS backbones are 
   significantly growing both in terms of density with the addition of 
   PEs to connect new customers and in terms of footprint as traditional 
   layer two aggregation networks may be replaced by IP/MPLS networks. 
   As a consequence many providers need to introduce IGP areas. Inter-
   area LSPs, that is LSPs that traverse at least two IGP areas, are 
   required to ensure MPLS connectivity between PEs located in distinct 
   IGP areas.  
    
   To set up the required MPLS LSPs between PEs in different IGP areas, 
   services providers have currently three solutions: LDP with IGP route 
   leaking, BGP [MPLS-BGP] over LDP with MPLS hierarchy, or also inter-
   area RSVP-TE [ID-RSVP-TE]. 
    
   IGP route leaking consists in redistributing all /32 PE loopback 
   addresses across area boundaries. As a result, LDP finds in the RIB 
   an exact match for its FEC and sets up the LSP. 
   As a consequence, the potential benefits that a multi-area domain may 
   yield are significantly diminished since a lot of addresses have to 
   be redistributed by ABRs, and the number of IP entries in the LSDB 
   and RIB maintained by every LSR of the domain (whatever the 
   area/level it belongs to) cannot be minimized. 
    
   Service providers may also set up these inter-area LSPs by using MPLS 
   hierarchy with BGP [MPLS-BGP] as a label distribution protocol 
   between areas. The BGP next hop would typically be the ABRs and the 
   BGP-created LSPs would be nested within intra-area LSPs setup by LDP 
   between PEs and ABRs and between ABRs. 
   This solution is not adequate for Service Providers which don't want 
   to run BGP on their P routers as it requires BGP on all ABRs. In 
   addition, MPLS hierarchy does not allow locally protecting the LSP

   against ABR failures (IP / LDP Fast Reroute), and hence ensuring sub-
   50ms recovery upon ABR failure. The resulting convergence time may 
   not be acceptable for stringent SLAs required for voice or mission 
   critical applications. Finally, this solution requires a significant 
   migration effort for Service Providers which started with LDP and IGP 
   route leaking to quickly set-up the fist inter-area LSPs. 
    
   Service providers may also setup these inter-area LSPs by using 
   inter-area RSVP-TE [ID-RSVP-TE]. This is a relevant solution when 
   RSVP-TE is already used for setting up intra-area LSPs, and inter-
   area traffic engineering features are required. In return this is not 
   a desired solution when LDP is already used for setting up intra-area 
   LSPs, and inter-area traffic engineering features are not required. 
 
   To avoid the above drawbacks, there is a need for an LDP based 
   solution which allows setting up contiguous inter-area LSPs while 
   avoiding leaking of /32 PE loopback addresses across area boundaries, 
   and hence keeping all the benefits of IGP hierarchy. 
    
   In that context, this document defines a new LDP Label Mapping 
   Procedure so as to support the setup of contiguous inter-area LSPs 
   while maintaining IP prefix aggregation on the ABRs. This procedure 
   is similar to the one defined in [LDP] but performs a longest match 
   when searching the FEC element in the RIB. 
    
5. Label Mapping Procedure 
    
   This document defines a new label mapping procedure for LDP. It MUST 
   be possible to activate/deactivate this procedure by configuration 
   and it SHOULD be deactivated by default. It MAY be possible to 
   activate it on a per prefix basis. 
    
   With this new longest match label mapping procedure, a LSR receiving 
   a Label Mapping message from a neighbor LSR for a Prefix Address FEC 
   Element (FEC1) SHOULD use the label for MPLS forwarding if its 
   routing table contains an entry that matches the FEC Element and the 
   advertising LSR is a next hop to reach the FEC. If so, it SHOULD 
   advertise the received FEC Element (FEC1) and a label to its LDP 
   peers. 
   Note that this is the specific FEC (FEC1) that LDP re-advertise to 
   its peers, and not the aggregated prefix found in the IP RIB during 
   the longest match search. 
    
   By "matching FEC Element", one should understand an IP longest match. 
   That is, either the LDP FEC element exactly matches an entry in the 
   IP RIB or the FEC element is a subset of an IP RIB entry. There is no 
   match for other cases such as the FEC element is a superset of a RIB 
   entry.

Internet Draft     LDP extensions for Inter-Area LSP      February 2008 
 
 
   Note that with this longest match Label Mapping Procedure, each LSP 
   established by LDP still strictly follows the shortest path(s) 
   defined by the IGP. 
    
   FECs selected by this "Longest Match" label mapping procedure are 
   distributed in an ordered way.. 
   In case of LER failure, the removal of reachability to the FEC occurs 
   using standard LDP procedures as defined in [LDP]. Similarly, the FEC 
   will be removed in an ordered way through the propagation of label 
   withdraw messages. The use of this reachability information by 
   application layers using the MPLS LSP (e.g., BGP) is outside the 
   scope of this document. 
    
   As per [LDP], LDP has already some interactions with the RIB. In 
   particular, it needs to be aware of the following events: 
     - prefix UP when a new IP prefix appears in the RIB 
     - prefix DOWN when an existing prefix disappears 
     - next-hop change when an existing prefix have new next hop 
        following a routing change. 
    
   With the longest match procedure, multiple FECs may be concerned by a 
   single RIB prefix change. The LSR must check all the FECs which are a 
   subset of this RIB prefix. So some LDP reactions following a RIB 
   event are changed: 
     - When a new prefix appears in the RIB, the LSR MUST check if this 
        prefix is a better match for some existing FECs. E.g. the FEC 
        elements 192.0.2.1/32 and 192.0.2.2/32 used the IP RIB entry 
        192.0.0/16 and a new more specific IP RIB entry 192.0.2/24 
        appears. This may result in changing the LSR used as next hop 
        and hence the NHLFE for this FEC. 
     - When a prefix disappears in the RIB, the LSR MUST check all FEC 
        elements which are using this RIB prefix as best match. For each 
        FEC, if another RIB prefix is found as best match, LDP MUST use 
        it. This may result in changing the LSR used as next hop and 
        hence the NHLFE for this FEC. Otherwise, the LSR MUST remove the 
        FEC binding and send a label withdraw message. 
     - When the next-hop of a RIB prefix change, the LSR must change 
        the NHLFE of all the FEC elements using this prefix. 
    
6. Application examples

   either to an OSPF ABR or to an IS-IS L1/L2 node. 
    
   All routers are MPLS enabled and MPLS connectivity (ie an LSP) is 
   required between all PE routers. 
    
    
   In the "egress" area "C", the records available are: 
   IGP RIB                          LDP FEC elements: 
     192.0.2.1/32                      192.0.2.1/32 
     192.0.2.2/32                      192.0.2.2/32

   In the "ingress" area "A", the records available are: 
   IGP RIB                          LDP FEC elements: 
     192.0/16                         192.0.2.1/32 
                                      192.0.2.2/32 
                                      192.0.2.3/32 
    
   In this situation, one LSP is established between the ingress PE4 and 
   every egress PE of area C while maintaining IP prefix aggregation on 
   the ASBRs. 
    
6.2. Use of static routes 
    
   Consider the following example where a LER is dual-connected to two 
   LSRs: 
    
                    +--------LSR1---- 
                    |         | 
                   LER        | 
                    |         | 
                    +--------LSR2---- 
    
                 Figure 2: LER dual-connected to two LSRs. 
    
   In some situations, especially on the edge of the network, it is 
   valid to use static IP routes between the LER and the two LSRs. If 
   necessary, the BFD protocol can be used to quickly detect loss of 
   connectivity. 
    
   The LDP specification defined in [LDP] would require on the ingress 
   LER the configuration and the maintenance of one IP route per egress 
   LER and per outgoing interface. 
    
   The longest match Label Mapping Procedure described in this document 
   only requires one IP route per outgoing interface. 
    
7. Caveats for deployment 
    
7.1. Deployment considerations 
    
   LSRs compliant with this document are backward compatible with LSRs 
   that comply with [LDP]. 
    
   For the successful establishment of end-to-end MPLS LSPs whose FEC 
   are aggregated in the RIB, this specification must be implemented on 
   all LSRs in all areas where IP aggregation is used. If an LSR on the 
   path does not support this procedure, then the LSP initiated on the 
   egress LSR stops at this non compliant LSR. There are no other 
   adverse effects.

Internet Draft     LDP extensions for Inter-Area LSP      February 2008 
 
 
   A service provider currently leaking specific (/32) LER's loopback 
   addresses in the IGP and now considering performing IP aggregation on 
   ABR should be aware that this may result in suboptimal routing as 
   discussed in [RFC 2966]. 
    
   If all IP prefixes are leaked in the IGP backbone area and only stub 
   areas use IP aggregation, LSRs in the backbone area don't need to be 
   compliant with this document. 
    
7.2. Impact on routing convergence time 
    
   IGP convergence is based on two factors: the SPF calculation and 
   FIB/LFIB update time.  The SPF calculation scales O(N*Log(N)) where N 
   is the number of Nodes. The FIB/LFIB update scales O(P) where P is 
   the number of modified prefixes. Currently, with most routers 
   implementations, the FIB/LFIB update is the dominant component [1]. 
   The solution documented in this draft reduces the Linkstate database 
   size and the number of FIB entries. However, it does not decrease the 
   number of LFIB entries. 
    
   In case of failure of the egress LER node, given that the IGP 
   aggregates IP route on ABRs, the routing convergence behavior is 
   changed compared to [LDP]. As the IGP does not carry specifics 
   prefixes outside of the egress area, the IGP will not propagate the 
   notification of node failure outside of the area. So application 
   layers using the LSP may, as a local decision, use the availability 
   of the MPLS LSP -as advertised by LDP- to achieve LER egress fault 
   notification in addition to application layer fault detection 
   mechanisms. For some applications (e.g., BGP) this is expected to be 
   faster. LDP will withdraw the FEC(s) of the egress LER in an ordered 
   way through the end-to-end propagation of the LDP withdraw message. 
   Compared to the IGP, this LDP failure notification may be faster or 
   slower depending on the implementations, the IGP timers used and the 
   network topology (network diameter). In typical topologies, the 
   convergence time is expected to be similar or even faster since there 
   is no need to wait for three consecutive SPF/PRC timers. 
    
   For all others failures (links, Ps and ABRs nodes), the failure 
   notification and the convergence are unchanged. 
    
8. Security Considerations 
    
   The longest match Label Mapping procedure described in this document 
   does not introduce any change as far as the Security Consideration 
   section of [LDP] is concerned. 
    
9. IANA Considerations 
    
   This document has no actions for IANA.
