      <t>The intention of this document is to analyze the set of 
      requirements for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) for the 
      Transport Profile of MPLS(MPLS-TP) as defined in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"/>, 
      to evaluate whether existing OAM tools (either from the current MPLS toolset 
      or from the ITU-T documents) can be applied to these requirements. Eventually, 
      the purpose of the document is to recommend which of the existing tools should 
      be extended and what new tools should be defined to support the set of OAM 
      requirements for MPLS-TP.</t>
    </abstract>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) plays a significant
      and fundamental role in carrier networks, providing methods for fault 
      management and performance monitoring in both the transport and the 
      service layers in order to improve their ability to support services with
      guaranteed and strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) while reducing their 
      operational costs.</t>
      <t><xref target="MPLS-TP Reqs"/> in general, and <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"/> 
      in particular define a set of requirements for OAM functionality in MPLS-Transport 
      Profile (MPLS-TP) for MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs) (network infrastructure) 
      and Pseudowires (PWs) (services).</t>

      <t>The purpose of this document is to analyze the OAM requirements and 
      evaluate whether existing OAM tools defined for MPLS can be used to 
      meet the requirements, identify which tools need to be extended to 
      comply with the requirements, and which new tools need to be defined.  We also 
      take the ITU-T OAM toolset, as defined in <xref target="Y.1731"/>, as a candidate to base 
      these new tools upon. The existing tools that are evaluated include LSP Ping 
      (defined in <xref target="LSP Ping"/>), MPLS Bi-directional Forwarding Detection (BFD) 
      (defined in <xref target="MPLS BFD"/>) and Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification 
      (VCCV) (defined in <xref target="PW VCCV"/> and <xref target="VCCV BFD"/>), and the 
      ITU-T OAM toolset defined in <xref target="Y.1731"/>.</t>

      <section title="LSP Ping">
      <t>LSP Ping is a variation of ICMP Ping and traceroute <xref target="ICMP" />] adapted to 
      the different needs of MPLS LSP.  Forwarding, of the LSP Ping packets, is 
      based upon the LSP Label and label stack, in order to guarantee that the 
      echo messages are switched in-band (i.e. over the same data route) of the LSP.
      However, it should be noted that the messages are transmitted using IP/UDP 
      encapsulation and IP addresses in the 127/8 (loopback) range.  The use of 
      the loopback range guarantees that the LSP Ping messages will be terminated, 
      by a loss of connectivity or inability to continue on the path, without being 
      transmitted beyond the LSP.  The return message of the LSP Ping could be sent 
      either on the return LSP of a corouted bidirectional LSP, or for associated 
      bidirectional LSPs or unidirectional LSPs may be sent using IP forwarding to the 
      IP address of the LSP ingress node.</t>

      <t>LSP Ping extends the basic ICMP Ping operation (of data-plane connectivity and 
      continuity check) with functionality to verify data-plane vs. control-plane 
      consistency for a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) and also Maximum Transmission 
      Unit (MTU) problems.  The traceroute functionality may be used to isolate and localize 
      the MPLS faults, using the Time-to-live (TTL) indicator to incrementally identify the 
      sub-path of the LSP that is succesfully traversed before the faulty link or node.  LSP 
      Ping is not dependent on the MPLS control-plane for its operation, i.e. even though the 
      propagation of the LSP label may be performed over the control-plane via the Label 
      Distribution Protocol (LDP).</t>
      <t>LSP Ping can be activated both in on-demand and pro-active (asynchronous)
      modes, as defined in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" />. </t>

      <t><xref target="P2MP LSP Ping" /> clarifies the applicability of LSP Ping to MPLS P2MP 
      LSPs, and extends the techniques and mechanisms of LSP Ping to the MPLS 
      P2MP environment.</t>
      
      <t><xref target="MPLS LSP Ping" /> extends LSP Ping to operate over MPLS 
      tunnels or for a stitched LSP.</t>

      <t>As pointed out above, TTL exhaust is the method used to terminate flows at
      intermediate LSRs, usually to locate a problem that was discovered previously.</t>
      <t>Some of the drawbacks identified with LSP Ping include - LSP Ping is considered 
      to be computational intensive as pointed out in <xref target="MPLS BFD" />.  Use of 
      the loopback address range (to protect against leakage outside the LSP) assumes that 
      all of the intermediate nodes support some IP functionality.  When LSP bundling is
      employed in the network, there is no guarantee that the LSP Ping packets will 
      follow the same physical path used by the data traffic.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="MPLS BFD">
      <t>BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) is a mechanism that is defined 
      for fast fault detection for point-to-point connections.  BFD defines a simple packet
      that may be transmitted over any protocol, dependent on the application that is 
      employing the mechanism.  BFD is dependent upon creation of a session that 
      is agreed upon by both ends of the link (which may be a single link, LSP, 
      etc.) that is being checked.  The session is assigned a separate identifier by each 
      end of the path being monitored.  This session identifier is by nature only unique 
      within the context of node that assigned it.  As part of the session creation, the 
      end-points negotiate an agreed transmission rate for the BFD packets. BFD supports an 
      echo function to check the continuity, and verify the reachability of the desired 
      destination.  BFD does not support neither a discovery mechanism nor a traceroute 
      capability for fault localization, these must be provided by use of other mechanisms.  
      The BFD packets support authentication between the routers being checked.</t>

      <t>BFD can be used in pro-active (asynchronous) and on-demand modes, as defined 
      in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" />, of operation.</t>

      <t><xref target="MPLS BFD" /> defines the use of BFD for P2P LSP end-points and is used to 
      verify data-plane continuity. It uses a simple hello protocol which can be 
      easily implemented in hardware. The end-points of the LSP exchange hello packets 
      at negotiated regular intervals and an end-point is declared down when expected 
      hello packets do not show up.  Failures in each direction can be monitored 
      independently using the same BFD session.  The use of the BFD echo function and 
      on-demand activation are outside the scope of the MPLS BFD specification.</t>

      <t>The BFD session mechanism requires an additional (external) mechanism to 
      bootstrap and bind the session to a particular LSP or FEC.  LSP Ping is designated 
      by <xref target="MPLS BFD" /> as the bootstrap mechanism for the BFD session in an 
      MPLS environment.  The implication is that the session establishment BFD messages for 
      MPLS are transmitted using a IP/UDP encapsulation.</t>
      <t>In order to be able to identify certain extreme cases of mis-connectivity, it is 
      necessary that each managed connection have its own unique identifiers.  BFD uses 
      Discriminator values to identify the connection being verified, at both ends of the path.
      These discriminator values are set by each end-node to be unique only in the context of 
      that node.  This limited scope of uniqueness would not identify a misconnection of crossing 
      paths that could assign the same discriminators to the different sessions.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="PW VCCV">
      <t>PW VCCV provides end-to-end fault detection and diagnostics for PWs 
      (regardless of the underlying tunneling technology). The VCCV switching function 
      provides a control channel associated with each PW (based on the PW Associated 
      Channel Header (ACH) which is defined in <xref target="PW ACH" />), and allows 
      sending OAM packets in-band with PW data (using CC Type 1: In-band VCCV)</t>

      <t>VCCV currently supports the following OAM mechanisms: ICMP Ping, LSP Ping, and BFD. 
      ICMP and LSP Ping are IP encapsulated before being sent over the PW ACH.  BFD for 
      VCCV supports two modes of encapsulation - either IP/UDP encapsulated (with IP/UDP 
      header) or PW-ACH encapsulated (with no IP/UDP header) and provides support to 
      signal the AC status. The use of the VCCV control channel provides the context,
      based on the MPLS-PW label, required to bind and bootstrap the BFD session to a 
      particular pseudo wire (FEC), eliminating the need to exchange Discriminator values.</t>
 
      <t>VCCV consists of two components: (1) signaled component to communicate 
      VCCV capabilities as part of VC label, and (2) switching component to cause 
      the PW payload to be treated as a control packet.</t>
	<t> VCCV is not directly dependent upon the presence of a control plane. 
	The VCCV capability negotiation may be performed as part of the PW signaling when LDP is used. 
	In case of manual configuration of the PW, it is the responsibility of the operator 
	to set consistent options at both ends. </t>

      <section title="ITU Recommendation Y.1731">
      <t><xref target="Y.1731"/> specifies a set of OAM procedures and related packet data 
      unit (PDU) formats that meet the transport network requirements for OAM.  These PDU 
      and procedures address similar requirements to those outlined in 
      <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" />.</t>

      <t>The PDU and procedures are described relative to an Ethernet environment, with the 
      appropriate encapsulation for that environment.  However, the actual PDU formats are 
      technology agnostic and could be carried over different encapsulations, e.g. VCCV control 
      channel. The OAM procedures, likewise, could be supported by MPLS-TP nodes just as they are 
      supported by Ethernet nodes.</t>

      <t><xref target="Y.1731"/> describes procedures to support the following OAM functions:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
        <t>Connectivity and Continuity Monitoring &ndash; for end-to-end checking</t>
        <t>Loopback functionality &ndash; to verify connectivity to intermediate nodes</t>
        <t>Link trace &ndash; provides information on the intermediate nodes of the path 
        being monitored, may be used for fault localization.</t>
        <t>Alarm indication signaling &ndash; for alarm suppression in case of faults 
        that are detected at the server layer.</t>
        <t>Remote defect indication &ndash as part of the Connectivity and Continuity Monitoring 
        packets</t>
        <t>Performance monitoring &ndash; including measurement of packet delays both uni and 
        bi-directional, measurement of the ratio of lost packets, and the effective bandwidth that 
        is supported without packet loss.</t>
        </list> </t>

      <t>It should be noted that the PDU defined in <xref target="Y.1731"/> includes various 
      information elements (fields) that may not be defined in [MPLS-TP OAM Framework].  These 
      fields include information on the MEG-Level, OpCode, and version. Addressing of the PDU 
      as defined in <xref target="Y.1731"/> is based on the MAC Address of the nodes, which 
      would need to be adjusted to support other addressing schemes, length of additional 
      information.  The addressing information is carried in &lt;Type, Length, Value&gt; (TLV) 
      fields that follow the actual PDU.</t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Architectural requirements and general principles of operation">
      <t />
      <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> defines a set of requirements on OAM architecture 
      and general principles of operations which are evaluated below:</t>
      
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> requires that OAM mechanisms in MPLS-TP 
            are independent of the transmission media and of the client service 
            being emulated by the PW. The existing tools comply with this 
            requirement.</t>

            <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> requires that MPLS-TP OAM MUST be able 
            to operate without IP functionality and without relying on control 
            and/or management planes.  It is required that OAM functionality MUST 
            NOT be dependent on IP routing and forwarding capabilities. The 
            existing tools do not rely on control and/or management plane, however 
            the following should be observed regarding the reliance on IP functionality:</t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>LSP Ping, VCCV Ping, and MPLS BFD makes use of IP header (UDP/IP) 
              and do not comply with the requirement. In the on-demand mode, LSP Ping also 
              uses IP forwarding to reply back to the source router.  This dependence on 
              IP, has further implications concerning the use of LSP Ping as the 
              bootstrap mechanism for BFD for MPLS.</t>

              <t>VCCV BFD supports the use of  PW-ACH encapsulated  BFD sessions 
              for PWs and can comply with the requirement.</t>

              <t>Y.1731 PDU are technology agnostic and thereby not dependent on IP functionality.  
              These PDU could be carried by a VCCV control channel.</t>
            </list>

            <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> requires that OAM tools for fault 
            management do not rely on user traffic, and the existing MPLS OAM 
            tools and Y.1731 already comply with this requirement. </t>

            <t> It is also required that OAM packets and the user traffic are congruent (i.e.
            OAM packets are transmitted in-band) and there is a need to differentiate OAM 
            packets from user-plane ones. </t>

              <list style="symbols">
                <t>For PWs, VCCV provides a control channel that can be associated with each 
                PW which allows sending OAM packets in band of PWs and allow the 
                receiving end-point to intercept, interpret, and process them 
                locally as OAM messages. VCCV defines different VCCV Connectivity 
                Verification Types for MPLS (like ICMP Ping, LSP Ping and IP/UDP 
                encapsulated BFD and PW-ACH encapsulated BFD).</t>

                <t>Currently there is no distinct OAM payload identifier in MPLS 
                shim. BFD and LSP Ping packets for LSPs are carried over UDP/IP 
                and are addressed to the loopback address range. The router at 
                the end-point intercepts, interprets, and processes the packets.</t>

                <t>The Y.1731 PDU could be carried over a control channel defined along the 
                data path and the processing of the PDU would occur at the destination indicated 
                in the PDU.</t>
              </list>

            <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> requires that the MPLS-TP OAM mechanism 
            allows the propagation of AC (Attachment Circuit) failures and their 
            clearance across a MPLS-TP domain</t>
               <list style="symbols">

                 <t>BFD for VCCV supports a mechanism for &quot;Fault detection and 
                 AC/PW Fault status signaling.&quot;  This can be used for both IP/UDP 
                 encapsulated or PW-ACH encapsulated BFD sessions, i.e. by setting 
                 the appropriate VCCV Connectivity Verification Type.This mechanism 
                 could support this requirement.</t>
               </list>

            <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> defines Maintenance Domain, Maintenance 
            End Points (MEPs) and Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIPs). Means 
            should be defined to provision these entities, both by static 
            configuration (as it is required to operate OAM in the absence of 
            any control plane or dynamic protocols) and by a control plane.  
            Note that the Y.1731 functionality currently supports these entities.</t>

            <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> requires a single OAM technology and 
            consistent OAM capabilities for LSPs, PWs, MPLS-TP Links, and Tandem Connections. 
            There is currently no mechanism in the IETF to support OAM for Tandem Connections. 
            Also, the existing set of tools defines a different way of operating 
            the OAM functions (e.g. LSP Ping to bootstrap MPLS BFD vs. VCCV).  Currently, the 
            Y.1731 functionality is defined for Ethernet paths, and the procedures would need 
            to be redefined for the various MPLS-TP path concepts.</t>

            <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> requires allowing OAM packets to be 
            directed to an intermediate node (MIP) of a LSP/PW. Technically, this could be 
            supported by the proper setting of the TTL value.  However, the applicability 
            of such a solution needs to be examined per OAM function. For details, see below.</t>

            <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> suggests that OAM messages MAY be 
            authenticated. BFD has a support for authentication. Other tools 
            should support this capability as well.  Y.1731 functionality uses the 
            identification of the path for authentication.</t>

        <section title="Architectural and Principles of Operation &ndash; Recommendations and Guidelines">

          <t>Based on the requirements analysis above, the following guidelines 
          should be followed to create an OAM environment that could more fully 
          support the requirements cited:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">

             <t>Extend the PW Associate Channel Header (ACH) to provide a control 
             channel at the path and section levels.  This could then be associated 
             with a MPLS-TP Link, LSP, or a Tandem Connection (TC).   The ACH should then 
             become a common mechanism for PW, LSP, MPLS-TP Link, and Tandem Connection.</t>
             <t>Create a VPCV (Virtual Path Connectivity Verification) definition 
             that would apply the definitions and functionality of VCCV to the 
             MPLS-TP environment for LSP or Tandem Connection.  Need a generalized addressing
             scheme that can also support unique identification of the monitored paths (or 
             connections).</t>
             <t>Create or extend the VCCV definition to define a mechanism that would
             apply the definitions and functionality of VCCV to PW Tandem Connections</t>
             <t>Apply BFD to these new mechanisms using the control channel 
             encapsulation, as defined above &ndash; allowing use of BFD for MPLS-TP 
             independent of IP functionality.  This could be used to address the CC-V functionality</t>

             <t>The Y.1731 PDU set could be used as a basis for defining the information units 
             to be transmitted over the VPCV.  The actual procedures and addressing schemes would 
             need to be adjusted for the MPLS-TP environment.</t>

             <t>Define a mechanism to create TCME and allow transmission 
             of the traffic via the Tandem Connection using label stacking.</t>
             <t>Define a mechanism that could be used to address a MIP of a path in a unique 
             way, to support the maintenance functions.  This addressing should be flexible to 
             allow support for different addressing schemes, and would supplement the TTL 
             addressing of intermediate points.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>Creating these extensions/mechanisms would fulfill the following architectural
          requirements, mentioned above:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
             <t>Independence of IP forwarding and routing.</t>
             <t>OAM packets should be transmitted in-band.</t>
             <t>Support a single OAM technology for LSP, PW, MPLS-TP Link, and TC.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>In addition, the following additional requirements can be satisfied:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
             <t>Provide the ability to carry other types of communications (e.g., 
             APS, Management Control Channel (MCC), Signalling Control Channel 
             (SCC)), by defining new types of communication channels for PWs, MPLS-TP Links,
             and LSPs.</t>

             <t>The design of the OAM mechanisms for MPLS-TP MUST allow the 
             ability to support vendor specific and experimental OAM functions.</t>

          </list></t>
        </section>

      <section title="MPLS-TP OAM Functions">
        <t>The following sections discuss the required OAM functions that were 
        identified in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" />.</t>

        <t>LSP Ping is not considered a candidate to fulfill the required 
        functionality, due its failure to comply with the basic architectural requirement
        for independence from IP routing and forwarding, as documented in Section 
        2 of this document.  However, usage of LSP Ping, in addition to the MPLS-TP 
        OAM tools, or in MPLS-TP deployments with IP functionality is not 
        precluded.</t>

        <section title="Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification">
          <t>Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification (CC-V) are OAM operations
          generally used in tandem, and compliment each other.  Together they are used to 
          detect loss of traffic continuity and misconnections between 
          MEPs and are useful for applications like Fault Management, Performance 
          Monitoring and Protection Switching, etc.  To guarantee that CC-V can identify
          misconnections from cross-connections it is necessary that the tool use 
          network-wide unique identifiers for the path that is being checked in the session.</t>

          <section title="Existing tools">
            <t>LSP Ping provides much of the functionality required for corouted bidirectional LSPs.  
            As observed above, LSP Ping may be operated in both asynchronous and on-demand mode.  
            Addressing is based on the LSP label and the basic functionality only requires support 
            for the loopback address range in each node on the LSP path.</t>
            <t>BFD defines functionality that can be used to support the pro-active OAM CC-V 
            function when operated in the asynchronous mode.  However, the current definition 
            of basic BFD is dependent on use of LSP Ping to bootstrap the BFD session.  Regarding
            the connectivity functional aspects, basic BFD has a limitation that it uses only 
            locally unique (to each node) session identifiers.</t> 
            <t>VCCV  can be used to carry BFD packets that are not IP/UDP 
            encapsulated for CC-V on a PW and use the PW label to identify the path.</t>
            <t>Y.1731 provides functionality for all aspects of CC-V for an Ethernet 
            environment, this could be translated for the MPLS-TP environment.  The CCM PDU 
            defined in <xref target="Y.1731"/> includes the ability to set the frequency 
            of the messages that are transmitted, and provides for attaching the address of 
            the path (in the Ethernet case &ndash; the MEG Level) and a sequencing number to 
            verify that CCM messages were not dropped.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Gap analysis">
            <t>There is currently no single MPLS tool that gives coverage for all aspects of CC-V 
            functionality.</t>

            <t>LSP Ping could be used to cover the cases of corouted bidirectional LSPs.  However, 
            there is a certain amount of computational overhead involved with use of LSP Ping 
            (as was observed in sec 1.1), the verification of the control-plane, and the need to 
            support the loopback functionality at each intermediate node.</t>


            <t>BFD could be extended to fill the gaps indicated above.  The extension would include:

              <list style="symbols">
                <t>A mechanism should be defined to carry BFD packets over LSP without
                reliance on IP functionality.</t>

                <t>A mechanism should be defined to bootstrap BFD sessions for 
                MPLS that is not dependent on UDP.</t>

                <t>BFD needs to be used in conjunction with &quot;globally&quot; unique 
                identifiers for the path or ME being checked to allow connectivity 
                verfication support.  There are two possibilities, to allow BFD to support 
                this new type of identifier &ndash;
                  <list style="symbols">
                    <t>Change the semantics of the two Discriminator fields that exist in
                    BFD and have each node select the ME unique identifier.  This may have
                    backward compatibility implications.</t>

                    <t>Create a new optional field in the packet carrying the BFD that would 
                    identify the path being checked, in addition to the existing session 
                    identifiers.</t>
                  </list>
                </t>

                <t>Extensions to BFD would be needed to cover P2MP connections.</t>
              </list>
            </t>

            <t>Use of the Y.1731 functionality is another option that should be considered.  The 
            basic PDU for CCM includes (in the flags field) an indication of the frequency of the 
            packets [eliminating the need to "negotiate" the frequency between the end-points], 
            and also a flag used for RDI.  The procedure itself would need adaptation to comply 
            with the MPLS environment.</t>

            <t>An additional option would be to create a new tool that would give coverage
            for both aspects of CC-V according to the requirements and the principles of operation
            (see section 2.1).  This option is less preferable.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Recommendations and Guidelines">
            <t>Extend BFD to resolve the gaps, using a new optional field for the unique 
            path identifier.  And optionally support the PDU format defined in 
            <xref target="Y.1731"/> with appropriate adjustments to support the MPLS-TP 
            architecture.</t> 
            <t>Note that <xref target="MPLS BFD" /> defines a method for using BFD to provide 
            verification of multipoint or multicast connectivity.</t>

        <section title="Alarm Notification">
          <t>Alarm Notification is a function that is used by a server layer MEP 
          to notify a failure condition to its client layer MEP(s) in order to 
          suppress alarms that may be generated by maintenance domains of the 
          client layer as a result of the failure condition in the server layer.
          This function should also have the capability to differentiate an administrative 
          lock from a failure condition at a different execution level.</t>

          <section title="Existing tools">
            <t>There is no mechanism defined in the IETF to support this function.

            the alarm is raised until it is cleared.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Diagnostic">
          <t>A diagnostic test is a function that is used between MEPs to verify 
          bandwidth throughput, packet loss, bit errors, etc.  This is usually performed 
          by sending packets of varying sizes at increasing rates (until the limits of the 
          service level) to measure the actual utilization.</t>

          <section title="Existing tools">
            <t>There is no mechanism defined in the IETF to support this function.  
            <xref target="Y.1731"/> describes a function that is dependent on sending a

        <section title="Adjacency and Route Tracing">
          <t>Functinality of route determination is used to determine the route of a connection 
          across the MPLS transport network. <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> defines two 
          closely related operations &ndash; one, Adjacency, for discovery of neighboring nodes 
          and the other, Route Tracing, for determination of the path that is being traversed and 
          location of a fault identified by e.g. the CC-V tool.</t>

          <section title="Existing tools">
            <t>LSP Ping supports a trace route function that could be used for co-routed 
            bidirectional paths. This could support the second type of fnctionality.</t>
            <t>However, the discovery aspect that is described by the Adjacency function does

        <section title="Lock">
          <t>The Lock function allows the system to block off transmission of data along a LSP.
          When a path end-point receives a command, e.g. from the management system, that the
          path is blocked, the end-point informs the far-end that the path has been locked 
          and that no data should be transmitted.  This function is used on-demand.</t>

        <section title="Remote Defect Indication">
          <t>Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is used by a MEP to notify its peer MEP that

            that the session has gone down, and the Diagnostic field indicates the 
            reason. Similarly, when LSP Ping is used for a corouted bidirectional LSP 
            the far-end LER could notify that there was a misconnectivity.</t>

        <section title="Packet Loss ">
          <t>Packet Loss is a function that is used to verify the quality of

            <t>Define a mechanism that would allow to support Delay Measurement.  The 
            mechanism should be based on measurement of the delay in transmission and 
            reception of OAM packets, transmitted in-band with normal traffic.  This 
            tool could be based on the tool defined in <xref target="Y.1731"/>.</t>

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Define a maintenance entity that could be applied both to LSPs and PWs that 
            would support management of a sub-path.  This entity should allow for  
            transmission of traffic by means of label stacking and proper TTL setting.</t>

            <t>Extend the control and the management planes to support the 
            configuration of the OAM maintenance entities and the set of functions 
            to be supported by these entities.</t>

            <t>Extend the ACH to provide a control channel for MPLS-TP Links, LSPs, and 
            Tandem Connections.</t>

            <t>Define a mechanism that would allow the unique addressing of the elements 
            that need to be monitored, e.g., the connections, MEPs, and MIPs of a path.  
            This mechanism needs to be flexible enough to support different addressing 
            schemes, e.g. IP addresses, NSAP, connection names.</t>

            <t>Define a VPCV mechanism for LSP and Tandem Connection. This mechanism 
            should reuse, as much as possible, the same principles of operation as VCCV. 
            The ACH should be extended to support CV types for each of the tools that are 
            defined below, in a way that is consistent for PW, LSP and Tandem Connection.</t>

            <t>The appropriate assignment of network-wide unique identifiers needed to
            support connectivity verification should be considered.</t>

            <t>Tools should be defined to support the following functions.  The tools could 
            be based on the procedures and PDU format defined by <xref target="Y.1731"/> or
