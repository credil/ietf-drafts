Internet-Draft      Kerberos Support for Camellia-CCM          July 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document defines encryption key and checksum types for Kerberos
   (v5) using the Camellia algorithm in Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) Mode
   [SP800-38C].  The Camellia cipher was developed by NTT and Mitsubishi
   Electric Corporation in 2000.  These new types support 128-bit block
   encryption and key sizes of 128 or 256 bits.  The Camellia algorithm
   and its properties are described in [RFC3713].

   There are a number of motivations to providing support for Camellia
   in Kerberos v5.  Among others, it is desirable to provide an
   alternate cipher should weaknesses be discovered in the AES and SHA-
   256 algorithms which are predominant today.  Additionally, due to the
   international user-base of Kerberos, supporting additional ciphers in
   key markets allows easier adoption and deployment of Kerberos in
   those regions.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Protocol Key Representation

   The profile in [RFC3961] treats keys and random octet strings as
   conceptually different.  But since the Camellia key space is dense,
   we can use any bit string of appropriate length as a key.  We use the
   byte representation for the key described in [RFC3713], where the
   first bit of the bit string is the high bit of the first byte of the
   byte string (octet string) representation.


4.  Key Generation from Pass Phrases or Random Data

   Given the above format for keys, we can generate keys from the
   appropriate amounts of random data (128 or 256 bits) by simply
   copying the input string.  To generate an encryption key from a pass
   phrase and salt string, Camellia uses the PBKDF2 function from PKCS
   #5 v2.0 [RFC2898].  This function of Camellia can be defined the as
   same specification of AES [RFC3962].  Note that the type-name is also
   input into PBKDF2, which is different to RFC3961.  Here the type-name
   is "camellia 128-ccm-128" or "camellia 256-ccm-128" (without the
   quotes).  The pseudorandom function used by PBKDF2 will be a SHA-1
   HMAC of the passphrase and salt.  The case of is AES described in
   Appendix B of [RFC3962].  For pseudorandom function, Camellia can be

7.  IANA Considerations

   Kerberos encryption and checksum type values used in section 7 were
   previously reserved in [RFC3961] for the mechanisms defined in this
   document.  The registries have been updated to list this document as
   the reference.


8.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document, there are no known weak keys
   for Camellia, and no security problem has been found on Camellia (see
   [NESSIE], [CRYPTREC], and [LNCS]).
