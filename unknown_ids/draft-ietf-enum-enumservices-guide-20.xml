      different URIs for different applications of said mapping
      mechanism.

      <t>This document specifies a revision of the IANA Registry for

      The new registration processes have been specifically designed 
      to be decoupled from the existence of 
      the ENUM working group. Compared to RFC 3761, the main
      changes are:

      <t>The IETF's ENUM Working Group has encountered an unnecessary
      amount of variation in the format of Enumservice Specifications.
      The ENUM Working Group's view of what particular 
      information is required and/or recommended has also evolved,
      and capturing these best current practices is helpful in both
      the creation of new Enumservice Specifications, as well as the
      revision or refinement of existing Enumservice Specifications.

      </xref> describes the ... DO WE REALLY NEED THIS?
      </t>

    </section>
-->

    <section anchor='requirements' title='Registration Requirements'>

        <t>As specified in the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF, 
        <xref target='RFC5234'/>) found in Section 2.4.3 of 
        <xref target='I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis'/>, an Enumservice is made
        up of Types and Subtypes.  For any given Type, the allowable
        Subtypes (if any) must be defined in the Enumservice
        Specification.  There is currently no concept of a registered
        Subtype outside the scope of a given Type.
        </t>
        <!-- Thus, the registration process uses the 'type' as its main key
        within the IANA Registry.</t> -->

        <t>While the combination of each Type and all of its Subtypes
        constitutes the allowed values for the "Enumservice" field, it
        is not sufficient to just list their allowed values.
        To allow for interoperability, a complete
        Enumservice Specification MUST document the semantics of the Type and
        Subtype values to be registered, and MUST contain all
        sections listed in <xref target='requiredSections'/> of this
        document.</t>

        <t>Furthermore, in order for an Enumservice to be registered,
        the entire Registration Document requires approval by the
        experts according to "Specification Required", which implies
        the use of a Designated Expert, as set out
        in <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines for Writing an IANA
        Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref> and
        <xref target='ExpRevGuidelines' /> of this document.
        </t>

        <t>All Enumservice Specifications are expected to conform also
        to various requirements laid out in the following sections.
        </t>

        <section anchor='FunctReq' title='Functionality Requirements'>

          <t>A registered Enumservice must be able to function as a
          selection mechanism for choosing
          one <xref target='RFC3403'>Naming Authority Pointer
          (NAPTR) </xref> DNS Resource Record (RR) from a set of such
          RRs.  That means the Enumservice Specification MUST define
          how to use the NAPTR RR and the URI(s) the NAPTR RR resolves
          to.
          </t>

          <t>Specifically, a registered Enumservice MUST specify the
          URI Scheme(s) that may be used for the Enumservice, and,
          when needed, other information that will have to be
          transferred into the URI resolution process itself.
          </t>

        </section>

        <section anchor='NamingReq' title='Naming Requirements'>

          <t>An Enumservice MUST be unique in order to be useful as a
          selection criteria:
        
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <list style='symbols'>
              
              <t>The Type MUST be unique.
              </t>
            
              <vspace blankLines='1'/>
              <t>The Subtype (being dependent on the Type) MUST be
              unique within a given Type.
              </t>

            </list>
          </t>

          <t>Types and Subtypes MUST conform to the ABNF specified in
          Section 2.4.4 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis'/>.
          </t>

          <t>The ABNF specified in Section 2.4.4 of
          <xref target='I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis'/> allows the "-" (dash)
          character for Types and Subtypes . To avoid confusion with
          possible future prefixes, a "-" MUST NOT be used as the
          first nor as the second character of a Type nor a Subtype.
          Furthermore, a "-" MUST NOT be used as the last character of
          a Type nor a Subtype.  In addition, Types and Subtypes are
          case insensitive and MUST be specified in small letters.
          </t>

          <t>To avoid confusion with Enumservice fields using an
          obsolete syntax, Type and Subtype MUST
          NOT start with the string "e2u".
          </t>

          <t>The Subtype for one Type MAY have the same identifier as
          a Subtype for
          another Type but it is not sufficient to
          simply reference another Type's Subtype.  The functionality
          of each Subtype MUST be fully specified in the context 
          of the Type being registered.
          </t>

          <t><xref target='cookbook'/> contains further naming
          requirements.

        </section>

        <section anchor='SecReq' title='Security Requirements'>

          <t>An analysis of security issues is REQUIRED for all
          registered Enumservices. (This is in accordance with the
          basic requirements for all IETF protocols.)
          </t>

          <t>All descriptions of security issues MUST be as accurate
          and extensive as feasible.  In particular,
          a statement that there are "no security issues associated
          with this Enumservice" must not be confused with "the
          security issues associated with this Enumservice have not
          been assessed".
          </t>

          <t>There is no requirement that an Enumservice must be
          completely free of security risks.  Nevertheless, all known
          security risks MUST be identified in an Enumservice
          Specification.
          </t>

          <t>The security considerations section of Enumservice
          Specifications is subject to continuing evaluation and
          modification, in accordance with
          <xref target='ChangeControl'/>.
          </t>

          <t>Some of the issues to be looked at in a security
          analysis of an Enumservice are:

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <list style='numbers'>

              <t>Complex Enumservices may include provisions for
              directives that institute actions on a user's resources.
              In many cases provision can be made to specify arbitrary
              actions in an unrestricted fashion which may then have
              devastating results (especially if there is a risk for
              a new ENUM look-up, and because of that an infinite loop
              in the overall resolution process of the E.164 number).
              </t>

              <vspace blankLines='1'/>
              <t>Complex Enumservices may include provisions for
              directives that institute actions which, while not
              directly harmful, may result in disclosure of
              information that either facilitates a subsequent attack
              or else violates the users' privacy in some way.
              </t>

              <vspace blankLines='1'/>
              <t>An Enumservice might be targeted for applications
              that require some sort of security assurance but do not
              provide the necessary security mechanisms themselves.
              For example, an Enumservice could be defined for storage
              of confidential security services information such as
              alarm systems or message service passcodes, which in
              turn require an external confidentiality service.

        </section>

        <section anchor='PubReq' title='Publication Requirements'>

          <t>Enumservices Specifications MUST be published according
          to the requirements for "Specification Required" set out
          in <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines for Writing an IANA
          Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref>.  RFCs fulfill these
          requirements. Therefore, it is strongly RECOMMENDED to
          publish Enumservice Specifications as RFCs.
          </t>

          <t>In case the Enumservice Specification is not published as
          an RFC, sufficient information that allows to uniquely
          identify the Enumservice Specification MUST be provided.

    <section  anchor='cookbook' title='Enumservice Creation Cookbook'>

      <section title='General Enumservice Considerations'>

        <t>ENUM is an extremely flexible identifier mapping mechanism,
        using E.164 (phone) numbers as input identifiers, and returning 
        URIs as output identifiers. Because of this flexibility, almost 
        every use case for ENUM could be implemented in several ways.
        </t>

        <t>Section 2 of <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines for Writing an IANA 
        Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref> provides motivation why 
        management of a name space might be necessary. Even though the 
        namespace for Enumservices is rather large (up to 32 alphanumeric 
        characters), there are reasons to manage this in accordance with 
        Section 2 of <xref target='RFC5226'/>.  The following is a list of 
        motivations applying to Enumservices:

        <vspace blankLines='1'/>
        <list style='symbols'>

          <t>Prevent hoarding or wasting of values: Enumservice Types
          are not an opaque identifier to prevent collisions in the
          namespace, but rather identify the use of a certain
          technology in the context of ENUM.  Service Types might also
          be displayed to end users in implementations, so meaningful
          Type strings having a clear relation to the protocols and
          applications used are strongly RECOMMENDED.
          Therefore, preventing hoarding, wasting, or "hijacking" of
          Enumservice Type strings is important.

          <t>Sanity check to ensure sensible or necessary requests:
          This applies to Enumservices, since especially various
          Enumservices for the same purpose would reduce the chance of
          successful interoperability, and unnecessarily increase the
          confusion among implementers.
          </t>

          <vspace blankLines='1'/>
          <t>Delegation of namespace portions: Theoretically, the Type
          and/or Subtype structure of Enumservices would allow for
          delegations of Type values, and self-supporting management
          of Subtype values by a delegate within the Type value. Such
          delegates could for example be other standardization
          bodies. However, this would require clear policies regarding
          publication and use of such Subtypes. Delegation of
          Enumservice namespace portions is therefore currently not
          supported.
          </t>

          <vspace blankLines='1'/>
          <t>Interoperability: Since the benefit of an Enumservice
          rises with the number of supporting clients, the
          registration and use of several services for a similar or
          identical purpose clearly reduces interoperability.
          Operational circumstances suggest to keep the space occupied
          by all services published in the NAPTR RRSet at any owner in
          the e164.arpa domain bounded. Registration of nearly
          identical services and subsequent competing or parallel use
          could easily increase the DNS operational complexity.

            expired and no longer be available in the Internet-Drafts
            Archive, or some work on Enumservices may have been

            <t><xref target='classification'/> provides three general 
            categories for Enumservice classification. In some cases, there
            might be several options for designing an Enumservice. For 
            example, a mapping service using HTTP could be considered a 
            "protocol Type" Enumservice (using HTTP as the protocol), 
            while it could also be viewed as
            an "application Type" Enumservice, with the application being 
            access to mapping services. In such a case where several 
            options are 
            available, defining use cases before commencing work on 
            the Enumservice itself might be useful before making a 
            decision on which  
            aspect of the Enumservice is more important.

        <t>Because of their flexibility, Enumservices can be and are used
        in a lot of different ways. This section contains a classification

          <t>Advice for choosing a proper 'name' string is independent of 
          the classification of the Enumservice.</t>
          <t>Generally, the 'name' string used for registering an Enumservice
          SHOULD give a clear indication of what the Enumservice is about.
          The 'name' has no technical significance in the processing of 
          the NAPTR (it doesn't even appear in resource record instances
          of the Enumservice). However, it
          is likely to be used for labeling the 
          Enumservice to end users.

          <t>Suitable 'names' are concise, distinctive, and clearly related

-->
        <section anchor='generalcons' title='General Type / Subtype Considerations'>
          <t>To avoid confusion, the name of a URI Scheme MUST NOT be
          used as a Type string for an Enumservice which is not specifically
          about the respective protocol or URI Scheme. For example,
          the Type string "imap" would be inadequate for use in an
          Enumservice about "Internet mapping" services, because it
          corresponds to an existing URI Scheme / protocol for
          something different.
          </t>

          <t>If Subtypes are defined, the minimum number SHOULD be
          two (including the empty Subtype, if defined). 
          The choice of just one possible Subtype for a given Type
          does not add any information when selecting an ENUM record,
          and hence can be left out completely.
          However, potential future expansion of a Type towards several
          Subtypes may justify the use of Subtypes, even in the case
          just one is currently defined, as noted in 
          <xref target='ExtensionOfExisting'/>.
          </t>

          <t>It is perfectly legal under a certain Type to mix the
          Enumservice without a Subtype (empty Subtype) with Enumservices 
          containing
          a Subtype. In that case, however, the Enumservice with an
          empty Subtype SHOULD be specified to reflect the base
          service, while the other Enumservices SHOULD
          be specified to reflect variants.

          <t>A good indication that an Enumservice belongs to this Class is

        <section anchor='applicationclass' title='Application-Based Enumservice Classes'>

          <t>Application-based Enumservices are used when the kind of
          service intended is not fully defined by a protocol specification.
          There are three cases here:

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <list style='symbols'>
            <t>Common Application Enumservice:
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            The application reflects a kind of interaction that can be realized
            by different protocols, but where the intent of the publisher is the
            same. From a user's perspective, there is a common kind of interaction -
            how that interaction is implemented is not important. The Enumservice
            Specification MUST describe the interaction and expected behavior in
            enough detail that an implementation can decide if this activity is one
            in which it can engage. However, it is RECOMMENDED that the Enumservice
            is defined in a way that will allow others to use it at a later date. An
            Enumservice that defines a generalized application is preferred to one
            that has narrow use.
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            An example of this flavor of Enumservice is email. Whilst this might
            appear to be a "pure" protocol scheme, it is not. The URI Scheme is
            'mailto', and does not identify the protocol used by the sender or the
            recipient to offer or retrieve emails.
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            Another example is SMS, where the existence of such an Enumservice
            indicates that the publishing entity is capable of engaging in sending
            or receiving a message according to the Short Messaging Service
            specifications. The underlying protocol used and the URI Scheme for the
            addressable end point can differ, but the "user visible" interaction of
            sending and receiving an SMS is similar.
            </t>         

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <t>Subset Enumservice:
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            The application interaction reflects a subset of the interactions
            possible by use of a protocol. Use of this Enumservice indicates that
            some options available by use of the protocol will not be accepted or
            are not possible in this case. Any such Enumservice Specification MUST
            define the options available by use of this NAPTR in enough detail that
            an implementation can decide whether or not it can use this Enumservice.

            Examples of this kind of Enumservice are "voice:tel" and "fax:tel". In both
            cases the URI holds a telephone number. However, the essential feature
            of these Enumservices is that the telephone number is capable of
            receiving a voice call or of receiving a Facsimile transmission,
            respectively. These form subsets of the interactions capable of using
            the telephone number, and so have their own Enumservices. These allow an
            end point to decide if it has the appropriate capability of engaging in
            the advertised user service (a voice call or sending a fax) rather than
            just being capable of making a connection to such a destination address.
            This is especially important where there is no underlying mechanism
            within the protocol to negotiate a different kind of user interaction.
            </t>

            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            <t>Ancillary Application Enumservice
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            Another variant on this is the Ancillary Application. This is one in
            which further processing (potentially using a number of different
            protocols or methods) is the intended result of using this Enumservice.
            An example of this kind of application is the "pstn:tel" Enumservice. This
            indicates that the NAPTR holds Number Portability data. It implies that
            the client should engage in number portability processing using the
            associated URI.

            Note that this Enumservice usually does not itself define the kind of
            interaction available using the associated URI. That application is
            negotiated with some other "out of band" means (either through prior
            negotiation, or explicitly through the number portability process, or
            through negotiation following the selection of the final destination
            address).

<!--      <section anchor='CookbookType' title='About Type Names'>

        <t>Generally, the Type name of an Enumservice is REQUIRED to
        give a clear indication of what the Enumservice is about.
        Usually, an Enumservice falls under one of the following
        categories:

          <vspace blankLines='1'/>
          <list style='symbols'>

            <t>"Protocol" Enumservices are exclusively tied to a
            specific protocol. Such Enumservices typically use that
            single protocol and its respective <xref
            target='RFC3986'>Uniform Resource
            Identifier (URI)</xref> Scheme (sometimes
            including a secure variant), and SHOULD use the protocol
            name / URI Scheme name as the Type. In case the secure
            variant has a different URI Scheme / protocol name, the
            URI Scheme name of the base protocol SHOULD be preferred.
            Examples of such Enumservices include <xref
            target='RFC3764'> 'SIP'</xref>, <xref
            target='RFC3762'>'H323'</xref> and

            <vspace blankLines='1'/></t>

            <t>"Application" Enumservices usually use the abstract
            application name as the Enumservice Type. The name of
            the actual protocol and URI Scheme may differ from the
            Type, but may also be identical (especially when <xref
            target='RFC3958'>application service location</xref> is
            used). If application name and URI Scheme name are
            identical, it is RECOMMENDED to use that name also as the
            Enumservice Type. In case the actual protocol / URI
            Scheme differs from the application name, it is
            RECOMMENDED to use that application name as Enumservice
            Type. Examples of such Enumservices are <xref

        <t>An Internet-Draft (or another specification as
        appropriate) MUST be written and made publicly available
        (submitted).  The Registration Document MUST follow the
        guidelines according to Sections <xref target='cookbook'
        format='counter' /> and <xref target='requiredSections'
        format='counter' /> of this document.
        The Review Guidelines for experts as defined in

        <t>Note: The ENUM WG mailing list &lt;enum@ietf.org&gt; will
        be kept open after conclusion of the ENUM WG.
        </t>

        <t>The authors SHOULD allow a reasonable period of time to
        elapse, such as two to four weeks, in order to collect any
        feedback.  The authors then consider whether or not to
        take any of those comments into account, by making changes to
        the Registration Document and submitting a revision, or otherwise
        proceeding.  The following outcomes are open to the authors.

          <t>The authors update and submit the Registration Document, and
          proceed to Step 3 above, which involves sending another

        <t>As set out in <xref target='PubReq' /> it is strongly
        RECOMMENDED to publish Enumservice Specifications as RFCs.  As
        to every RFC the normal IETF publication process applies (see

        Document is submitted in the form of an Internet Draft
        (e.g. via an IETF Working Group or a sponsoring Area
        Director). <xref target='Instructions2authors'/> also

        soon as the Enumservice Specification has been published

        in <xref target='RFC5226'></xref>. The &lt;registrationdocs&gt;
        element in the IANA Template MUST contain an
        unambiguous reference to the Enumservice Specification (see
        also <xref target='enumServiceReg'></xref>). In addition, the
        authors MUST provide IANA with a stable URL to the Enumservice
        Specification, in order that IANA may obtain the information
        included in the Enumservice Specification. IANA will then add

        of <xref target='RFC5226'></xref>,
        experts are appointed by the IESG upon recommendation by the RAI

      <section anchor='ExpRevGuidelines' title='Review Guidelines'>

      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor='ExtensionOfExisting' title='Extension of Existing Enumservice Specifications'>

      <t>There are cases where it is more sensible to extend an
      existing Enumservice registration rather than proposing a new
      one. Such cases include adding a new Subtype to an existing
      Type. Depending on the nature of the extension, the original
      Enumservice Specification needs to be extended (Updates) or replaced
      (Obsoletes) <xref target='RFC2223'></xref>.
      Specifically, an update is appropriate when a new Subtype is
      being added without changes to the existing repertoire. A
      replacement is needed if there is a change to the default,
      or changes to the assumptions of URI support in clients.
      </t>

      <t>Any Enumservice Specifications for existing Enumservices that
      are extended MUST comply with the specifications contained

      <section title='Considerations Regarding This Document'>

        <t>Since this document does not introduce any new technology, protocol, 
        or Enumservice Specification, there are no specific security issues to 
        be considered for this document.  However, as this is a guide to authors
        of new Enumservice Specifications, the next section should be 
        considered closely by authors and experts. 
        </t>

      </section>

      <section anchor='secguide' title='Enumservice Security Considerations Guideline'>

        <t><xref target='I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis'/> already outlines
        security considerations affecting ENUM as a whole.
        Enumservice Specifications do not need to and SHOULD NOT
        repeat considerations already listed in that document.
        However, Enumservice Specifications SHOULD include a reference
        to that section.
        </t>

        <t>
        ENUM refers to resources using existing URI Schemes and protocols.
        Enumservice Specifications do not need to and SHOULD NOT repeat
        security considerations affecting those protocols and URI Schemes
        themselves.
        </t>

        <t>However, in some cases, the inclusion of those protocols and URI
        Schemes into ENUM specifically could introduce new security issues.  In 
        these cases, those issues or risks MUST be covered in the "Security 
        Considerations" section of the Enumservice Specification.
        Authors should pay particular attention to any indirect risks that are

        <vspace blankLines='0' />
        &lt; http://www.iana.org/assignments/enum-services &gt;.
        </t>

        <t>This Registry publishes representations derived from 
        the IANA Registration Template as 
        described in <xref target='RegistrationTemplate'/>
        and specified in <xref target='enumServiceReg'/>.
        </t>

        <t>Where the Enumservice Specification is NOT an RFC, IANA MUST hold
        an escrow copy of that Enumservice Specification. Said escrow copy
        will act as the master reference for that Enumservice Registration.
        </t>

      </section>


      <section anchor='Structure' title='Structure'>

        <t>IANA maintains the Enumservice Registry sorted in
        alphabetical order. The first sort field is Type, the
        second is Subtype.</t>

        <t>Each Enumservice starts with a caption, which is composed
        of Type and Subtype, separated by a colon; e.g. if the Type
        is "foo" and the Subtype "bar", the resulting caption is
        "foo:bar".
        </t>

        <t><xref target='I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-transition' />
        updates the existing Enumservices by transforming them into
        the new XML chunk based IANA Registration Template (see also
        <xref target='RevisionOfExisting' />).
        </t>

      </section>

      <section anchor='expertReviewProcedure' title='Expert Review Procedure'>

        <t>Whenever a Registration Document is submitted via the
        IANA website, IANA will take care of the "Expert Review"
        process according to <xref target='RFC5226'>"Guidelines for
        Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"</xref>.</t>

        <t>To prevent clashes IANA will check whether a request with
        identical "type:subtype" (or "type" without Subtype) was
        submitted for Expert Review earlier and will inform the
        experts accordingly. It is up to the experts to resolve
        possible clashes.</t>

        <t>Once the experts have approved the Enumservice, IANA will
        inform the authors. This information SHOULD also include a
        reminder that (i) the authors are now responsible for
        publication of the Registration Document (see
        also <xref target='Step6'></xref>) and (ii) the Enumservice
        will be added to the IANA Registry only after its
        Enumservice Specification is published according to
        the "Specification Required" policy as defined
        in <xref target='RFC5226'></xref> (see
        also <xref target='Step7'></xref>).</t>

        <t>Note: After sending the approval note to the authors, IANA
        has no further responsibilities besides keeping internal
        records of approved Registration Documents.  IANA will be
        involved again at registration of the Enumservice (see
        <xref target='ianaRegistrationProcedure'></xref>).</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor='ianaRegistrationProcedure' title='Registration Procedure'>

        <t>There is a slight difference in process depending on
        whether or not the Enumservice Specification will be
        published as an RFC. The reason for this difference lies in the
        current RFC publication process that foresees IANA
        interaction shortly before publication of an RFC.</t>

        <section anchor='RegistrationRFC' title='Published as RFC'>
          

          <t>As per the RFC publication process IANA will receive the
          Enumservice Specification to carry out IANA actions
          shortly before publication of the RFC. The IANA action
          will be to register the Enumservice, i.e. add the
          Enumservice to the IANA "Enumservice Registrations"
          Registry (see also <xref target='Location'></xref>).
          </t>

          <t>IANA MUST only add Enumservices to the Registry,
          if the experts have approved the corresponding Enumservice
          Specification as to be published. IANA SHOULD attempt to
          resolve possible conflicts arising from this together with
          the experts. In case changes between the approved and the
          to be published version are substantial, IANA MAY reject
          the request after consulting the experts.</t>
          
          <t>IANA MUST ensure that any further changes the
          Enumservice Specification might undergo before final RFC
          publication are approved by the experts.</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor='RegistrationNonRFC' title='Published as generic Specification'>

          <t>Once the authors have informed IANA about the
          publication, IANA MUST ensure that the requirements to
          "Specification Required" as defined in
          <xref target='RFC5226' /> are met, the reference to the
          specification is unambiguous, and the content of the
          Enumservice Specification is identical to the Registration
          Document as approved by the experts. IANA will then
          register the Enumservice, i.e.  add the Enumservice to the
          IANA "Enumservice Registrations" Registry, and make an
          escrow copy (see also <xref target='Location'></xref>).
          </t>

          <t>IANA MUST only add Enumservices to the Registry,
          if the experts have approved the corresponding Enumservice
          Specification as published. IANA SHOULD attempt to resolve
          possible conflicts arising from this together with the
          experts. In case changes between the approved and the
          published version are substantial, IANA MAY reject the
          request after consulting the experts.</t>

      </section>


      <section anchor='ChangeControl' title='Change Control'>
       
        <t>Change control of any Enumservice Registrations is done
        by "Specification Required", 
        which implies the use of a Designated Expert, according to
        <xref target='RFC5226'/>. Updates of Enumservice
        Specifications MUST comply with the guidelines described in
        this document. Updates are handled the same way as
        initial Enumservice Registrations.
        </t>

        <t>Authorized Change Controllers are the experts and the
        IESG.</t>
        
        <t>Enumservice registrations MUST NOT be deleted. An
        Enumservice that is believed no longer appropriate for use
        can be declared obsolete by publication of a new
        Enumservice Specification changing its &lt;usage&gt; element
        (Intended Usage) to "OBSOLETE"; such Enumservices will be
        clearly marked in the lists published by IANA.
        As obsoletions are updates, they are also handled the same
        way as initial Enumservice Registrations.

        </t>

      </section>


      <section anchor='Restrictions' title='Restrictions'>

        <t>As stated in <xref target='NamingReq'/>, a "-" (dash)
        MUST NOT be used as the first nor as the second
        nor as the last character of
        a Type nor a Subtype. Furthermore, Type nor Subtype of
        any Enumservice MUST NOT be set to nor start with "E2U".
        Any Enumservice
        registration requests not following these restrictions MUST be
        rejected by IANA, and the Expert Review process SHOULD NOT
        be initiated.
        </t>

        <t><xref target='enumServiceReg'/> contains examples for
        Enumservice registrations. Therefore, IANA MUST NOT register
        an Enumservice with Type or Subtype set to "foo", "bar", or
        "sbar", unless the experts explicitly confirm an exception.

      <t>Note: The "voicemsg" Enumservice has several Subtypes. For
      each Subtype, an individual XML chunk must be submitted to IANA,
      with only the first one shown above. This is to avoid any
      ambiguity of the relation between &lt;subtype&gt; and
      &lt;urischeme&gt; elements.

    <section title='Changes Overview'>
    <t>This section lists the changes applied to the Enumservice
    registration process and the IANA Registry definition, compared to
    RFC 3761.
    </t>
    <vspace blankLines='1'/>
    <list style='symbols'>

       <t>While RFC 3761 required "Standards track or Experimental"
          RFCs for an Enumservice to be registered, this document
          mandates "Specification Required", which implies the use of
          a Designated Expert.</t>
 
      <vspace blankLines='1'/>
 
       <t>This document defines the classification of Enumservices.
          The IANA Registration Template has been complemented to
          contain a &lt;class&gt; element (Enumservice Class).
       </t>

      <vspace blankLines='1'/>
 
       <t>A new element &lt;registrationdocs&gt; (Enumservice
          Specification) has been added to the IANA Registration
          Template.
       </t>

       <vspace blankLines='1'/>

       <t>The former field "Any other information that the author
          deems interesting" of the IANA Registration Template turned
          into the &lt;additionalinfo&gt; element (Further Information).
       </t>

       <vspace blankLines='1'/>

       <t>The Enumservice "Name" field has been removed from the IANA
          Registration Template.
       </t>

       <vspace blankLines='1'/>

       <t>The Registration Template is now a chunk of XML data, 
       reflecting IANA's recent work to convert registries to XML.

      <t>draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide-17:
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>bernie: As per IANA feedback changed the process in a way, that
                     Expert Review takes place before the publication process

          <t>bernie: Lowercased vCard example for Type</t>
          <t>bernie: Not that enum-svc-trans does not update compliant with this spec</t>
          <t>bernie: Added Pekka Savola and Michelle Cotton to Acknowledgments.
                     The above changes are a result of Pekka's feedback.</t>
          <t>bernie: Typo in Step 6 corrected (Step 5 -> step 6)</t>
          <t>bernie: 'IANA Template' -> 'XML chunk based IANA template' (in Structure)</t>
          <t>bernie: Removed reference to RFC4355 (not used)</t>

       </list>
      </t>

      <t>draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide-16:
        <list style='symbols'>

          <t>bernie: changed drama number in the example to a non-premium
                     rate one (feedback Lawrence Conroy)</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide-15:
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>bernie: cleared out authors/requesters</t>
          <t>alex: added ABNF reference + acronym expansion</t>
          <t>alex: changed order of paragraphs in introduction - registry 
          update now in front of blah blah paragraph</t>
          <t>alex: various editorial and formatting updates to the new
          XML template specs. </t>
          <t>alex: moved XML template to IANA considerations</t>
          <t>alex: removed "identifying tag" language</t>
          <t>alex: clarified "element" vs. "field" usage - "element" 
                   now refers to XML chunk pieces of IANA registration, 
                   while "fields" refers to other things, like fields
                   of a NAPTR record, etc.</t>
          <t>alex: removed more subtypes from third example - one subtype 
                   per template ensures that there is no confusion between 
                   the URI schemes for various subtypes</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide-14:

          XML chunk information</t>
          <t>alex: added references to person information in examples</t>

          <t>bernie: minor editorial corrections and nits</t>
          <t>jason: added the IANA XML chunk, as well as some examples</t>
       </list>
      </t>


      <t>draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide-13:
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>alex: Some minor changes - the only real open issue is 
             whether or not we should go to an XML template instead of the 
             plain text one. IANA provided a "chunk", but gave no feedback
             about schema, namespace, etc. so it is deemed not "normative" 
             enough yet. 
             </t>
          <t>bernie: Implemented IANA Feedback: made difference
             between RFC and no-RFC specs more clear; now the both
             variants slightly differ in process.</t>
          <t>bernie: Implemented more feedback of Peter Koch:
            <list style='symbols'>
              <t>Terminology updated throughout the document:
                 Enumservice Specification / Registration Document</t>
              <t>Changed IANA Template field 'Registration Document(s)
                 to 'Enumservice specification(s)'</t>
              <t>Disallow dash '-' as last char of Type or Subtype </t>
              <t>Removed XML2RFC template and referencing sections</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>bernie: changed "Subtype names MAY be shared between URI
             Schemes that the Registration specifies as mandatory to
             implement for a given Subtype." to "Subtype names MAY be
             shared between URI Schemes, if all the URI Schemes within
             the same Subtype are mandatory to implement."</t>
          <t>bernie: Cleared out independent submission and added
             reference to RFC 4846</t>
          <t>jason: Per the co-chair and Peter Koch, doc changed to BCP.
             Doc doesn't specify a protocol but a process. Both RFC 2026, 
             section 5, and section 4.3 of RFC 5226 suggest that process documents,
             and IANA Guidelines in particular, usually are published as BCP RFCs.
             Also, there's little to implement independently in this draft that 
             could help advance it on the Standards Track.
          </t>
          <t>jason: various nits clean-up suggested by Peter Koch.</t>
       </list>
      </t>


      <t>draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide-12:
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>bernie: Refined process, i.e. separation of Expert Review
          and addition to IANA Registry (only after publication of spec):
            <list style='symbols'>
              <t>Split up "Further Steps" into three new sections</t>
              <t>Extended ASCII Art</t>
              <t>Adjusted IANA considerations</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>bernie: Updated Open Issues</t>
          <t>alex: Added reference to RFC3552 (security considerations
             guidance)</t>
          <t>alex: Added instructions2author as informative reference - 
             i don't see another way (revision 439, closing ticket 25)</t>
          <t>alex: Moved text about use cases from Review Guidelines
             up to "other sections", slightly reworded it (revision 438,

          <t>bernie: Updated own contact details</t>
          <t>bernie: Implemented editorial feedback from Alfred Hoenes</t>
          <t>bernie: Added some clarifications to IANA consideration as
             proposed by Michelle Cotton (IANA)</t>
          <t>bernie: Edited appendix "Changes Overview",
             moved stuff from "Introduction" to "Changes Overview"</t>
          <t>bernie: Updated IANA section "Change Control":
            <list style='symbols'>
              <t>Authorized Change controllers are experts and IESG</t>
              <t>Removed field "Authorized Change Controller"
                 (was introduced in -11)</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>bernie: Replaced "number blocks" by "wildcards"
             (DNS Considerations) to avoid conflict with RFC3761</t>
          <t>bernie: Extended recommendations about search for previous work</t>
          <t>bernie: Adjusted sections "Revision of Pre-Existing
             Enumservice RFCs" and "Submit Registration Document to IANA"</t>
       </list>
      </t>


      <t>draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide-11:
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>bernie: Replaced reference rfc2434bis with rfc5226</t>
          <t>bernie: Moved terminology related paragraph from
          Introduction to Terminology Section</t>
          <t>bernie: Added reference to transition document</t>
          <t>jason: Updated my author address</t>
          <t>jason: Closed out active tickets at 
             http://ietf.enum.at/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/report/1</t>
          <t>jason: Section 8, review of pre-existing enumservices, updated with 
             IETF 72 feedback that this must take place</t>
          <t>jason: Ticket 39: Added text to section 4.1, general enumservice 
             considerations, section 2, bullet 2 to address comment by Lawrence 
             Conroy about expired I-Ds </t>
          <t>jason: Ticket 45: Added text to section 7.1, expert review / review 
             guidelines, bullet 3, to indicate that a use case SHOULD be included.
             Also added related text to section 5.8, other sections, to address 
             this. This resolves comments by Lawrence Conroy</t>
          <t>jason: Ticket 55: Replaced 'repository' with 'registry' throughout
             the document to normalize this text and make it uniform.</t>
          <t>jason: Ticket 52: Checked references to ensure rfc5226 is cited 
             instead of rfc2434bis, which Bernie seems to have mainly covered. I 
             also added a reference in the header for rfc5226, since it is a 
             normative reference.</t>
          <t>jason: Ticket 25: Removed reference to rfc2223bis-08 as this I-D is 
             now listed as dead.</t>
          <t>jason: Ticket 49: Have updated section 5.2, IANA registration, bullet
             on authors addresses, to say that email addresses MUST NOT be 
             included in the IANA Registry.  I opened a related ticket.  Seems 
             there are some email addresses in the registry.  Also simplified
             author(s) and expert(s) to authors and experts throughout.</t>
          <t>jason: Ticket 28: Minor changes to Section 10.1 and 10.2, Security 
             Considerations</t>
          <t>jason: Ticket 30: Updated section 6.4, 6.5, on IANA registration to 
             include that submission must be in XML format for IANA and that the
             Enumservice must have an RFC number, per discussion at IETF 72</t>
          <t>jason: Ticket 42: Cleaned up section 5.7, DNS considerations, per
             comments from Lawrence.</t>
          <t>jason: Updated definitions to reflect IANA Designated Experts per
             RFC 5226, and clean up of IANA-related terms (Registry, Template, 
             etc.)</t>
          <t>jason: Ticket 51: added section to describe the need to have a contact
             listed for updating a registration, per RFC 5226, section 5.2.</t>
