Internet-Draft         SIP-based vertical handover              May 2008


1.  Introduction

   Let us consider a terminal (hereafter named "Mobile Host" or MH),
   possibly equipped with different network interfaces (i.e. a subset of
   WiFi, Bluetooth, GPRS, 3G, fixed Ethernet, WiMax).  Each interface
   will receive an IP address from the corresponding Access Network
   (AN).  Therefore the mobile host will have a set of different IP
   addresses and will have to select which one to use when running
   multimedia sessions with correspondent terminals.  While the mobile
   host moves, the "selected" interface may become not available due to
   loss of signal, or could suffer high packet loss or packet delay.
   Under these circumstances, the MH would like to switch to another
   interface (using a different IP address) keeping the running sessions
   active.  Even with a single interface the connected access network
   can become not available anymore and the terminal could connect to
   another Access Network (in this case on the same technology), which
   provides a different IP address.  If the switch to the new AN is fast
   enough, the MH could also be interested in keeping the running
   session active.

   This problem has been addressed with different approaches.  One
   approach is based on "network level" mobility solutions like Mobile
   IP or MobileIPv6.  Another approach is based on "application level"
   mobility solution.  The main advantage of application level mobility
   solutions is that they do not require any support at the network
   level from the different access networks, which only needs to provide
   plain IP connectivity.  This document details the issues and the
   requirements regarding an "application level" mobility solution, in
   particular considering the solution that exploits the SIP protocol.
   The aim of SIP based application level mobility is to keep active a
   multimedia session that has been established with SIP, while the
   terminal switches from one network interface to another or it changes
   IP address on the same interface.

2.  Scenario for vertical handover

   The figure below shows a Mobile Host that wants to communicate with a
   "Correspondent Host" (CH).  The Mobile Host can connect to different
   Access Networks (AN1, AN2, AN3 are represented in the figure).  The
   different ANs could have different wireless or wired techologies and
   the Mobile Host could be connected to more than one Access Network at
   the same time if it has more than one physical network interface.
   Note that the Access Networks can provide public or private addresses
   to the mobile host (in most typical scenarios the Access Networks are
   likely to provide private IP addresses).  For example in the figure
   below AN 1 and AN 3 provide a private address (as shown by the NAT
   box), while AN2 provides a public address.  Similarly, the
   Correspondent Host can have a public address (like CH 1 in the
   figure) or a private IP address (like CH 2 in the figure).

                                    \__________/

                     +-------+-----+          +-----+--------+

   The goal of the handover mechanism is to let the MH roam among
   different Access Networks in a seamless way.  The mobility management
   mechanism should consider the roaming of the MH both "off call" and
   during an active call.  The MH should be able to dinamically choose
   among the available ANs the one that better suits its needs (e.g.
   perceived quality of media flows and cost) in a given moment.  It is
   important to notice that this draft does not address the criteria and
   tools for selection of the "best" access network, it only details the
   issues and the requirements regarding the mobility management and
   handover execution mechanims.

3.  Requirements for Vertical Handovers

   In this session we discuss a set of requirements that a mobility
   management solution based on SIP should have.

   o  The solution should be as fast as possible.  The goal is to
      provide a "seamless" handover with no perception from the user
      point of view.  If it is not possible to provide a truly seamless
      solution, the impairment should be minimized.

   o  The solution should support a "forward handover" (i.e. in which
      all the procedure is performed on the new target Access Network).
      This is important if the connection on the old Access Network is
      suddenly broken.  If possible (i.e. if the connection with the old
      access network does not break suddenly) the solution could exploit
      the communication on the old access network in order to better
      control the handover procedure.  Soft handovers (i.e. where the
      two active connections can be exploited in the same moment to send
      the session data) could be exploited.

   o  The handover solution should be compatible with NATted networks,
      i.e. it should interoperate gracefully with NAT traversal
      mechanisms for SIP signaling and for session media flows.

   o  The handover solution should not require a support in the
      different access network.  The access networks are only required
      to provide IP connectivity (either with public or private
      addresses) for the forwarding of signalling SIP packets and media
      RTP packets.

   o  The switch of the "active" interface during a SIP transaction
      should be supported.  As an example the terminal should be able to
      send (receive) an INVITE on the currenlty active interface, switch
      to another interface and receive (send) the 200 OK on the other
      interface.

   o  An optional desirable requirement is to allow the decoupling of
      "user level" registration and mobility and "terminal level"
      mobility.  As an example a user with AOR "sip:user@domain.com"
      should be allowed to use different terminals (i.e.  Mobile Hosts
      supporting the handover solutions as well as normal SIP
      terminals).  These terminals can be used in sequence or at the
      same time depending on the capability of his own "home" registrar/
      proxy server, and this is independent of the vertical handover
      solution which takes care of the mobility of only one specific
      Mobile Host.  A concrete example for this requirement is to
      support a user "sip:user@domain.com" who owns three Mobile Hosts
      (one could be his phone, one his PDA, one his laptop) and two

      fixed terminals (his desktop and his home VoIP phone).  The
      vertical handover solution takes care of the mobility of the
      phone, PDA and laptop as three separate Mobile Hosts (which can
      also be all active in the same time).

   o  An optional desirable requirement is to provide privacy with
      respect to user location and user movements.

   o  Another desirable feature is that existing user agents should
      inter-work with the handover procedure without the need to be
      updated.  This requirement applies especially to the
      "Correspondent Hosts" (which in general are not moving, but they
      are communicating with a moving terminal).  If this requirement is
      not fulfilled there is the need to change all SIP terminals to
      support the handovers of Mobile Host.  To a lesser extent this
      requirements also applies to the Mobile Host itself: it would be
      desirable to reuse existing SIP clients (User Agents) without
      updating them to support the terminal mobility.

4.  Taxonomy of possible approaches

   The application level mobility solutions based on SIP can be
   classified in "Correspondent host based" or "Intermediate Element
   based".

   o  Correspondent Host based solutions

   RFC 3261 [RFC3261] has a built in mechanism for mobility management.
   The "off-call" mobility management consists in the Registration
   process.  The "on-call" handover is performed using RE-INVITE
   messages towards the Corresponding Node.  No intermediate entities
   are directly involved in the handover process.  This has the
   advantage that no additional procedure for the handover needs to be
   implemented in network elements, and that there is no additional load
   in the networks due to the handovers.  On the other hand, the
   procedure requirese that the Corresponding Node (which in general is
   not a mobile host) supports the RE-INVITE mechanism.  A second
   drawback is that the handover delay is directly proportional to the
   end-to-end delay, and this could be higher with respect to the delay
   occurring between a mobile node and an intermediate entity.

   o  Intermediate Element based solutions

   In order to overcome the drawbacks of the Correspondent Host based
   solutions, "intermediate" entities that take an active role in the
   handover can be introduced.  Several proposals can be found in the
   literature, but to our knowledge no internet draft has been proposed
   in this respect.  Hereafter we mention some of the existing
   proposals.  In [Banerjee] intermediate entities are used only to
   speed up the handover process, but the handover procedure still
   involves the Corresponding Node as well.  A similar approach is
   followed in [PROFITIS], which also deals with location based
   selection of the "optimal" intermediate entity and of wireless access
   points.  In [Salsano08] the intermediate entities fully handle the
   user mobility, hiding the mobility to the Corresponding Nodes.

5.  Related work

   The general problem of continuity of multimedia sessions is currently
   heavily discussed in 3GPP and it was agreed to be studied in
   timeframe of Release 8.  The handover that this document refers to is
   referred to as PS-PS session continuity in 3GPP terminology. 3GPP is
   considering the usage of an intermediate element in order to handle
   PS-PS multimedia session continuity as written in 3GPP Technical
   Report 23.893.  The usage of such intermediate element is also the
   core point of the solution presented in [Salsano08], [Salsano07].
   Also the scenarios currently under discussion are inline with the
   scenario depicted in Section 2 (please note that the scenarios
   discussed in 3GPP are currently a superset of the one depicted in
   this document).  Within the SIPPING WG an internet draf has been
   submitted [draft-izumikawa] which deals with SIP based bi-casting for
   seamless vertical handover.  The considered requirements and
   scenarios have a significant overlap with the ones proposed here, in
   particular there is the common requirement that Correspondent node
   should not be affected by handover procedure if possible and there is
   the introduction of intermediate entities to support the handover.  A
   difference is that in [draft-izumikawa] it is considered a
   requirement not to add new header fields.

6.  Conclusions

   As a concluding remark, we believe that it is important to consider a
   new solution for vertical handover that meets the set of requirements
   that has been analysed.  This solution will help providing seamless
   handover to SIP based application with a better performance and
   overcoming some shortcomings of the current solution based on
   [RFC3261].  The motivation of this work assumes even more relevance
   if 3GPP interest in this kind of solutions is taken into account.

7.  Security considerations

   The security considerations should be taken into account in the
   design of the handover solution, so that no new additional security
   issues will be introduced.
