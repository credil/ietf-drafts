    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document provides Smart Grid designers with advice on how to
      best "profile" the Internet Protocol Suite (IPS) for use in Smart Grids.
      It provides an overview of the IPS and the key protocols that are
      critical in integrating Smart Grid devices into an IP-based
      infrastructure.</t>

      <t>The IPS provides options for several key architectural components.
      For example, the IPS provides several choices for the traditional
      transport function between two systems: the Transmission Control
      Protocol (TCP) <xref target="RFC0793"></xref>, the Stream Control
      Transmission Protocol (SCTP) <xref target="RFC4960"></xref>, and the
      Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) <xref
      target="RFC4340"></xref>. Another option is to select an encapsulation
      such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <xref target="RFC0768"></xref>
      which essentially allows an application to implement its own transport
      service. In practice, a designer will pick a transport protocol which is
      appropriate to the problem being solved.</t>

      <t>The IPS is standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF). IETF protocols are documented in the Request for Comment (RFC)
      series. Several RFCs have been written describing how the IPS should be
      implemented. These include: <list style="symbols">
          <t><xref target="RFC1122">Requirements for Internet Hosts -
          Communication Layers</xref>,</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC1123">Requirements for Internet Hosts -
          Application and Support</xref>,</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC1812">Requirements for IP Version 4
          Routers</xref>, and</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC4294">IPv6 Node Requirements</xref>,</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>At this writing, RFC 4294 is in the process of being updated, in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-node-req-bis"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document is intended to provide Smart Grid architects and
      designers with a compendium of relevant RFCs (and to some extent
      Internet Drafts), and is organized as an annotated list of RFCs. To that
      end, the remainder of this document is organized as follows: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t><xref target="suite"></xref> describes the Internet Architecture
          and its protocol suite.</t>

          <t><xref target="protocols"></xref> outlines the set of protocols
          that will be useful in Smart Grid deployment.</t>

          <t>Finally, <xref target="network"></xref> provides an overview of
          the business architecture embodied in the design and deployment of
          the IPS.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="suite" title="The Internet Protocol Suite">
      <t>Before enumerating the list of Internet protocols relevant to Smart
      Grid, we discuss the layered architecture of the IPS, the functions of
      the various layers, and their associated protocols.</t>

      <section anchor="architecture" title="Internet Protocol Layers">
        <t>While Internet architecture uses the definitions and language
        similar to language used by the ISO Open System Interconnect Reference
        (ISO-OSI) Model (<xref target="iso-osi"></xref>), it actually predates
        that model. As a result, there is some skew in terminology. For
        example, the ISO-OSI model uses "end system" while the Internet
        architecture uses "host. Similarly, an "intermediate system" in the
        ISO-OSI model is called an "internet gateway" or "router" in Internet
        parlance. Notwithstanding these differences, the fundamental concepts
        are largely the same.</t>

        <section title="Application">
          <t>In the Internet model, the Application, Presentation, and Session
          layers are compressed into a single entity called "the application".
          For example, the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) <xref
          target="RFC1157"></xref> describes an application that encodes its
          data in an ASN.1 profile and engages in a session to manage a
          network element. The point here is that in the Internet the
          distinction between these layers exists but is not highlighted.
          Further, note that in <xref target="irm"></xref> these functions are
          not necessarily cleanly layered: the fact that an application
          protocol encodes its data in some way and that it manages sessions
          in some way doesn't imply a hierarchy between those processes.
          Rather, the application views encoding, session management, and a
          variety of other services as a tool set that it uses while doing its
          work.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Transport">
          <t>The term "transport" is perhaps among the most confusing concepts
          in the communication architecture, to large extent because people
          with various backgrounds use it to refer to "the layer below that
          which I am interested in, which gets my data to my peer". For
          example, optical network engineers refer to optical fiber and
          associated electronics as "the transport", while web designers refer
          to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <xref
          target="RFC2616"></xref> (an application layer protocol) as "the
          transport".</t>

          <t>In the Internet protocol stack, the "transport" is the lowest
          protocol layer that travels end-to-end unmodified, and is
          responsible for end-to-end data delivery services. In the Internet
          the transport layer is the layer above the network layer. Transport
          layer protocols have a single minimum requirement: the ability to
          multiplex several applications on one IP address. <xref
          target="RFC0768">UDP</xref>, <xref target="RFC0793">TCP</xref>,
          <xref target="RFC4340">DCCP</xref>, <xref
          target="RFC4960">SCTP</xref>, and <xref target="RFC5740">NORM</xref>
          each accomplish this using a pair of port numbers, one for the
          sender and one for the receiver. A port number identifies an
          application instance, which might be a general "listener" that peers
          or clients may open sessions with, or a specific correspondent with
          such a "listener". The session identification in an IP datagram is
          often called the "five-tuple", and consists of the source and
          destination IP addresses, the source and destination ports, and an
          identifier for the transport protocol in use.</t>

          <t>In addition, the responsibilities of a specific transport layer
          protocol typically includes the delivery of data (either as a stream
          of messages or a stream of bytes) in a stated sequence with stated
          expectations regarding delivery rate and loss. For example, TCP will
          reduce rate to avoid loss, while DCCP accepts some level of loss if
          necessary to maintain timeliness.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Network">
          <t>The main function of the network layer is to identify a remote
          destination and deliver data to it. In connection-oriented networks
          such as Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) <xref
          target="RFC3031"></xref> or Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), a path
          is set up once, and data is delivered through it. In connectionless
          networks such as Ethernet and IP, data is delivered as datagrams.
          Each datagram contains both the source and destination network layer
          addresses, and the network is responsible for delivering it. In the
          Internet Protocol Suite, the Internet Protocol is the network that
          runs end to end. It may be encapsulated over other LAN and WAN
          technologies, including both IP networks and networks of other
          types.</t>

          <section title="Internet Protocol">
            <t>IPv4 and IPv6, each of which is called the Internet Protocol,
            are connectionless ("datagram") architectures. They are designed
            as common elements that interconnect network elements across a
            network of lower layer networks. In addition to the basic service
            of identifying a datagram's source and destination, they offer
            services to fragment and reassemble datagrams when necessary,
            assist in diagnosis of network failures, and carry additional
            information necessary in special cases.</t>

            <t>The Internet layer provides a uniform network abstraction
            network that hides the differences between different network
            technologies. This is the layer that allows diverse networks such
            as Ethernet, 802.15.4, etc. to be combined into a uniform IP
            network. New network technologies can be introduced into the IP
            Protocol Suite by defining how IP is carried over those
            technologies, leaving the other layers of the IPS and applications
            that use those protocol unchanged.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Lower layer networks">
            <t>The network layer can recursively subdivided as needed. This
            may be accomplished by tunneling, in which an IP datagram is
            encapsulated in another IP header for delivery to a decapsulator.
            IP is frequently carried in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) across
            the public Internet using tunneling technologies such as the
            Tunnel mode of IPsec, IP-in-IP, and Generic Route Encapsulation
            (GRE) <xref target="RFC2784"></xref>. In addition, IP is also
            frequently carried in circuit networks such as MPLS <xref
            target="RFC4364"></xref>, GMPLS, and ATM. Finally, IP is also
            carried over local wireless (IEEE 802.11, 802.15.4, or 802.16)
            networks and switched Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) networks.</t>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section title="Media layers: Physical and Link">
          <t>At the lowest layer of the IP architecture, data is encoded in
          messages and transmitted over the physical media. While the IETF
          specifies algorithms for carrying IPv4 and IPv6 various media types,
          it rarely actually defines the media - it happily uses
          specifications from IEEE, ITU, and other sources.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="security-issues" title="Security issues">
        <t>While it is popular to complain about the security of the Internet,
        solutions to many Internet security problems already exist but have
        either not been widely deployed, may impact critical performance
        criteria, or require security measures outside the IPS. Internet
        security solutions attempt to mitigate a set of known threats within
        the IPS domain at a specified cost; addressing security issues
        requires first a threat analysis and assessment and a set of
        mitigations appropriate to the threats. Since we have threats at every
        layer, we should expect to find mitigations at every layer.</t>

        <section title="Physical security ">
          <t>At the physical and data link layers, threats generally center on
          physical attacks on the network - the effects of backhoes,
          deterioration of physical media, and various kinds of environmental
          noise. Radio-based networks are subject to signal fade due to
          distance, interference, and environmental factors; it is widely
          noted that IEEE 802.15.4 networks frequently place a metal ground
          plate between the meter and the device that manages it. Fiber was at
          one time deployed because it was believed to be untappable; we have
          since learned to tap it by bending the fiber and collecting
          incidental light, and we have learned about backhoes. As a result,
          some installations encase fiber optic cable in a pressurized sheath,
          both to quickly identify the location of a cut and to make it more
          difficult to tap.</t>

          <t>While there are protocol behaviors that can detect certain
          classes of physical faults, such as keep-alive exchanges, physical
          security is generally not considered to be a protocol problem.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Network, Transport, and Application Layer Session Authentication">
          <t>At the network, transport, and application layers, and in lower
          layer networks where dynamic connectivity such as ATM Switched
          Virtual Circuits (SVCs) or "dial" connectivity are in use, there
          tend to be several different classes of authentication/authorization
          requirements. The basic requirements that must be satisfied are:
          <list style="numbers">
              <t>Verify that peers are appropriate partners; this generally
              means knowing "who" they are and that they have a "need to know"
              or are trusted sources.</t>

              <t>Verify that information that appears to be from a trusted
              peer is in fact from that peer.</t>

              <t>Validate the content of the data exchanged; it must conform
              to the rules of the exchange.</t>

              <t>Defend the channel against denial of service attacks.</t>

              <t>Ensure the integrity of the information transported to defend
              against modification attacks.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>In other words, both the communications channel itself and
          message exchanges (both by knowing the source of the information and
          to have proof of its validity) must be secured. Three examples
          suffice to illustrate the challenges.</t>

          <t>One common attack against a TCP session is to bombard the session
          with reset messages. Other attacks against TCP include the "SYN
          flooding" attack, in which an attacker attempts to exhaust the
          memory of the target by creating TCP state. In particular, the
          attacker attempts to exhaust the target's memory by opening a large
          number of unique TCP connections, each of which is represented by a
          Transmission Control Block (TCB). The attack is successful if the
          attacker can cause the target to fill its memory with TCBs.
          Experience has shown that by including information in the transport
          header or a related protocol like the IPsec (<xref
          target="ipsec"></xref>) or TLS (<xref target="tls"></xref>), a host
          can identify legitimate messages and discard the others, thus
          mitigating any damage that may have been caused by the attack.</t>

          <t>Another common attack involves unauthorized communication with a
          router or a service. For example, an unauthorized party might try to
          join the routing system. To protect against such attacks, an
          Internet Service Provider (ISP) should not accept information from
          new peers without verifying that the peer is who it claims to be and
          that the peer is authorized to carry on the exchange of
          information.</t>

          <t>More generally, in order to secure a communications channel, it
          must be possible to verify that messages putatively received from a
          peer were in fact received from that peer. Only once messages are
          verified as coming a trusted peer should a host or router engage in
          communications with the peer.</t>

          <t>Unfortunately, even trusted peers forward incorrect or malicious
          data. As a result, securing the channel is not sufficient;
          information exchanged through the channel must also be secured. In
          electronic mail and other database exchanges, it may be necessary to
          be able to verify the identity of the sender and the correctness of
          the content long after the information exchange has occurred - for
          example, if a contract is exchanged that is secured by digital
          signatures, one will wish to be able to verify those signatures at
          least throughout the lifetime of the contract, and probably a long
          time after that.</t>

        <section title="Confidentiality">
          <t>In addition to securing the communications channel and messaging,
          there is frequently a requirement for confidentiality.
          Confidentiality arises at several layers, sometimes simultaneously.
          For example, providers of credit card transaction services want
          application layer privacy, which can be supplied by encrypting
          application data or by an encrypted transport layer. If an ISP (or
          other entity) wants to hide its network structure, it can decide to
          encrypt the network layer header.</t>

        <section anchor="dns" title="Domain Name System (DNS)">
          <t>The DNS' main function is translating names to numeric IP
          addresses. While this is not critical to running a network, certain
          functions are made a lot easier if numeric addresses can be replaced
          with mnemonic names. This facilitates renumbering of networks and
          generally improves the manageability and serviceability of the
          network. DNS has a set of security extensions called DNSSEC, which

        <section title="Network Management">
          <t>Network management has proven to be a difficult problem. As such,
          various solutions have been proposed, implemented, and deployed.
          Each solution has its proponents, all of whom have solid arguments
          for their viewpoints. The IETF has two major network management
          solutions for device operation: SNMP, which is ASN.1-encoded and is
          primarily used for monitoring of system variables and is a polled
          architecture, and NetConf <xref target="RFC4741"></xref>, which is
          XML-encoded and primarily used for device configuration.</t>

          <t>Another aspect of network management is the initial provisioning
          and configuration of hosts, which is discussed in <xref

          identity authentication and authorization (as well as other
          provisioning and configuration) that may not be within the scope of
          either DHCP or Neighbor Discovery. While the IP Protocol Suite does
          not have specific solutions for secure provisioning and
          configuration, these problems have been solved using IP protocols in

        IPS.</t>

        <section title="Session identification, authentication, authorization, and accounting">
          <t>The IPS provides approaches to Authentication, Authorization, and
          Accounting (AAA) issues. Since these different approaches have
          different attack surfaces and protection domains, they require some
          thought in application. The two major approaches to AAA taken by the
          IPS are the IP Security Architecture (<xref target="ipsec"></xref>),
          which protects IP datagrams, and Transport Layer Security (<xref
          target="tls"></xref>), which protects the information which the
          transport layer delivers.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="ipsec" title="IP Security Architecture (IPsec)">
          <t>The <xref target="RFC4301">Security Architecture for the Internet
          Protocol (IPsec)</xref> is a set of control and data protocols that
          are implemented between IPv4 and the chosen transport layer, or in
          IPv6's security extension header. It allows transport layer sessions
          to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping,
          tampering, or message forgery. As is typical with IETF
          specifications, the architecture is spelled out in a number of
          documents which specify the specific components: the <xref
          target="RFC4302">IP Authentication Header (AH)</xref> <xref
          target="RFC4303">Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)</xref>, <xref
          target="RFC5996">Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) </xref>, <xref
          target="RFC4307">Cryptographic Algorithms</xref>, <xref
          target="RFC4835">Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements
          for ESP and AH</xref>, and the use of <xref
          target="RFC4309">Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) </xref>.</t>

          <t>IPsec provides two modes: Transport mode and tunnel mode. In
          transport mode, IPsec ESP encrypts the transport layer and the
          application data. In tunnel mode, the source IP datagram is
          encrypted and encapsulated in a second IP header addressed to the
          intended decryptor. As might be expected, tunnel mode is frequently
          used for virtual private networks which need to securely transmit
          data across networks with unknown (or no) other security properties.
          In both cases, authentication, authorization, and confidentiality
          extend from system to system, and apply to all applications that the
          two systems use.</t>

          <t>Note that IPsec can provide non-repudiation when an asymmetric
          authentication algorithm is used with the AH header and both sender
          and receiver keys are used in the authentication calculation.
          However, the default authentication algorithm is keyed MD5, which
          like all symmetric algorithms cannot provide non-repudiation by
          itself (since the sender's key is not used in the computation). So
          while IPsec provides a means of authenticating network level objects
          (packets), these objects are are ephemeral and not directly
          correlated with a particular application. As a result
          non-repudiation is not generally applicable to network level objects
          such as packets.</t>

          target="I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4347-bis"></xref> are mechanisms that travel
          within the transport layer protocol data unit, meaning that they
          readily traverse network address translators and secure the
          information exchanges without securing the datagrams exchanged or
          the transport layer itself. Each allows client/server applications
          to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping,
          tampering, or message forgery. Authentication, authorization, and
          confidentiality exist for a session between specific
          applications.</t>

          <t>In order to communicate securely, a TLS client and TLS server
          must agree on the cryptographic algorithms and keys that they will
          use on the secured connection. In particular, they must agree on

          <t>Since each category has multiple options, the number of possible
          combinations is large. As a result, TLS does not allow all possible

        following sections describe the IETF's coexistence and transition
        mechanisms for IPv4 and IPv6.</t>

        <t>Note that since IPv4 free pool (the pool of available, unallocated
        IPv4 addresses) is almost exhausted, the IETF recommends that new
        deployments use IPv6 and that IPv4 infrastructures are supported via
        the mechanisms described in <xref target="transition"></xref>.</t>

        <section anchor="transition" title="IPv4/IPv6 Coexistence Advice">
          <t>The IETF has specified a variety of mechanisms designed to
          facilitate IPv4/IPv6 coexistence. The IETF actually recommends
          relatively few of them: the current advice to network operators is
          found in <xref
          target="I-D.arkko-ipv6-transition-guidelines">Guidelines for Using
          IPv6 Transition Mechanisms</xref>. The thoughts in that document are
          replicated here.</t>

          <section anchor="DualStack" title="Dual Stack Coexistence">
            <t>The simplest coexistence approach is to <list style="symbols">
                <t>provide a network that routes both IPv4 and IPv6,</t>

                <t>ensure that servers similarly support both protocols,
                and</t>

                <t>require that all new systems purchased or upgraded support
                both protocols.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>The net result is that over time all systems become protocol
            agnostic, and that eventually maintenance of IPv4 support becomes
            a business decision. This approach is described in the <xref

            <t>In those places in the network that support only IPv4 the
            simplest and most reliable approach is to provide virtual
            connectivity using tunnels or encapsulations. Early in the IPv6

                   title="Translation between IPv4 and IPv6 Networks">
            <t>In those cases where an IPv4-only host would like to
            communicate with an IPv6-only host (or vice versa), protocol
            translation may be indicated. At first blush, protocol translation
            may appear trivial; on deeper inspection it turns out that
            protocol translation can be complicated.</t>

            <t>The most reliable approach to protocol translation is to
            provide application layer proxies or gateways, which natively
            enable application-to-application connections using both protocols
            and can use whichever is appropriate. For example, a web proxy
            might use both protocols and as a result enable an IPv4-only
            system to run HTTP across on IPv6-only network or to a web server
            that implements only IPv6. Since this approach is a service of a
            protocol-agnostic server, it is not the subject of standardization
            by the IETF.</t>

            <t>For those applications in which network layer translation is
            indicated, the IETF has designed a translation mechanism which is
            described in the following documents: <list style="symbols">
                <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework">Framework for

                IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers</xref></t>
              </list></t>

            <t>As with IPv4/IPv4 Network Address Translation, translation
            between IPv4 and IPv6 has limited real world applicability for an
            application protocol which carry IP addresses in its payload and
            expects those addresses to be meaningful to both client and
            server. However, for those protocols that do not, protocol
            translation can provide a useful network extension.</t>

            <t>Network-based translation provides for two types of services:
            stateless (and therefore scalable and load-sharable) translation
            between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that embed an IPv4 address in
            them, and stateful translation similar to IPv4/IPv4 translation
            between IPv4 addresses. The stateless mode is straightforward to
            implement, but due to the embedding, requires IPv4 addresses to be
            allocated to an otherwise IPv6-only network, and is primarily
            useful for IPv4-accessible servers implemented in the IPv6
            network. The stateful mode allows clients in the IPv6 network to
            access servers in the IPv4 network, but does not provide such
            service for IPv4 clients accessing IPv6 peers or servers with
            general addresses; it does however have the advantage that it does
            not require that a unique IPv4 address be embedded in the IPv6
            address of hosts using this mechanism.</t>

            <t>Finally, note that some networks site networks are IPv6 only
            while some transits networks are IPv4 only. In these cases it may
            be necessary to tunnel IPv6 over IPv4 or translate between IPv6
            and IPv4.</t>

          <t>IPv4 also provides for fragmentation and reassembly of long
          datagrams for transmission through networks with small Maximum
          Transmission Units (MTU). The MTU is the largest packet size that

            in the routing database, and the most specific ("longest") prefix
            found that contains it is used to identify the next hop router, or
            the end system it will be delivered to. This is not generally
            implemented on hosts, although it can be; generally, a host sends

            Internet architecture but may be of interest in the Smart Grid is
            the development of so-called "Reliable Multicast". This is
            "so-called" because it is not "reliable" in the strict sense of
            the word - it is perhaps better described as "enhanced
            reliability". A best effort network by definition can lose
            traffic, duplicate it, or reorder it, something as true for
            multicast as for unicast. Research in "Reliable Multicast"
            technology intends to improve the probability of delivery of
            multicast traffic.</t>

            regarding what was desirable. Important results from that research
            include a number of papers and several proprietary protocols

          <t>IPv6 also provides for fragmentation and reassembly of long

            applications that exchange connectivity information and build
            semi-static destination routing databases. If a datagram is
            directed to a given destination address, the address is looked up
            in the routing database, and the most specific ("longest") prefix
            found that contains it is used to identify the next hop router, or
            the end system it will be delivered to. Routing is not generally
            implemented on hosts (although it can be); generally, a host sends
            datagrams to a router on its local network, and the router carries
            out the intent.</t>

            target="RFC2080">RIPng for IPv6</xref> and <xref
            target="RFC2453">RIP Version 2</xref>. Briefly, RIP is a distance
            vector routing protocol that is based on a distributed variant of
            the widely known Bellman-Ford algorithm. In distance vector
            routing protocols, each router announces the contents of its route
            table to neighboring routers, which integrate the results with
            their route tables and re-announce them to others. It has been
            characterized as "routing by rumor", and suffers many of the ills
            we find in human gossip - propagating stale or incorrect
            information in certain failure scenarios, and being in cases
            unresponsive to changes in topology. <xref

            <t>The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol is one of
            the more widely used protocols in the Internet. OSPF is a based on
            Dijkstra's well known shortest path first (SPF) algorithm. It is
            implemented as <xref target="RFC2328">OSPF Version 2</xref> for

            <t>The advantage of any SPF-based protocol (i.e., OSPF and IS-IS)
            is primarily that every router in the network constructs its view
            of the network from first hand knowledge rather than the "gossip"
            that distance vector protocols propagate. As such, the topology is
            quickly and easily changed by simply announcing the change. The
            disadvantage of SPF-based protocols is that each router must store
            a first-person statement of the connectivity of each router in the

            IS-IS is also based on Dijkstra's SPF algorithm. It was originally
            specified as ISO DP 10589 for the routing of CLNS, and extended

            <t>As with OSPF, the positives of any SPF-based protocol and
            specifically IS-IS are primarily that the network is described as
            a lattice of routers with connectivity to subnets and isolated
            hosts. It's topology is quickly and easily changed by simply
            announcing the change, without the issues of "routing by rumor",
            since every host within the routing domain has a first-person
            statement of the connectivity of each router in the domain. The
            negatives are a corollary: each router must store a first-person

            to other devices. In essence, routing is calculated and discovered

          routing and delivery of multicast messages.</t>

          <t>The mechanisms experimentally developed for reliable multicast in
          IPv4, discussed in <xref target="Multicast"></xref>, can be used in
          IPv6 as well.</t>

          <section anchor="PIM" title="Protocol-Independent Multicast Routing">
            <t>A multicast routing protocol has two basic functions: Building
            the multicast distribution tree and forwarding multicast traffic.
            Multicast routing protocols generally contain a control plane for
            building distribution trees, and a forwarding plane that uses the
            distribution tree when forwarding multicast traffic.</t>

            <t>A the highest level, the multicast model works as follows:
            hosts express their interest in receiving multicast traffic from a
            source by sending a Join message to their first hop router. That
            router in turn sends a Join message upstream towards the root of
            the tree, grafting the router (leaf node) onto the distribution
            tree for the group. Data is delivered down the tree toward the
            leaf nodes, which forward it onto the local network for
            delivery.</t>

            <t>The initial multicast model deployed in the Internet was known
            as Any-Source Multicast (ASM). In the ASM model any host could
            send to the group, and inter-domain multicast was difficult.
            Protocols such as <xref target="RFC3973">Protocol Independent
            Multicast - Dense Mode (PIM-DM): Protocol Specification
            (Revised)</xref> and <xref target="RFC4601">Protocol Independent
            Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification
            (Revised)</xref> were designed for the ASM model.</t>

            <t>Many modern multicast deployments use Source-Specific Multicast
            (PIM-SSM) <xref target="RFC3569"></xref><xref
            target="RFC4608"></xref>. In the SSM model, a host expresses
            interest in a "channel", which is comprised of a source (S) and a
            group (G). Distribution trees are rooted to the sending host
            (called an "(S,G) tree"). Since only the source S can send on to
            the group, SSM has inherent anti-jamming capability. In addition,
            inter-domain multicast is simplified since it is the
            responsibility of the receivers (rather than the network) to find
            the (S,G) channel they are interested in receiving. This implies
            that SSM requires some form of directory service so that receivers
            can find the (S,G) channels.</t>

        <section title="Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)">
          <t><xref target="RFC4960">SCTP</xref> is a more recent reliable
          transport protocol that can be imagined as a TCP-like context
          containing multiple separate and independent message streams (as
          opposed to TCP's byte streams). The design of SCTP includes
          appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding
          and masquerade attacks. As it uses a message stream interface as
          opposed to TCP's byte stream interface, it may also be more
          appropriate for the ISO Transport Service than RFC 1006/2126.</t>

          <t>SCTP offers several delivery options. The basic service is
          sequential non-duplicated delivery of messages within a stream, for
          each stream in use. Since streams are independent, one stream may
          pause due to head of line blocking while another stream in the same
          session continues to deliver data. In addition, SCTP provides a
          mechanism for bypassing the sequenced delivery service. User
          messages sent using this mechanism are delivered to the SCTP user as
          soon as they are received.</t>

          <t>SCTP implements a simple "cookie" mechanism intended to limit the
          effectiveness of flooding attacks by mutual authentication. This
          demonstrates that the application is connected to the same peer, but
          does not identify the peer. Mechanisms also exist for <xref
          target="RFC5061">Dynamic Address Reconfiguration</xref>, enabling
          peers to change addresses during the session and yet retain
          connectivity. <xref target="RFC3436">Transport Layer Security</xref>

        (HANs), Building Area Networks (BANs) and Field Area Networks (FANs)
        envisioned by Smart Grid architects.</t>

        <section anchor="service-discovery" title="Service Discovery">
          <t>Service discovery protocols are designed for the automatic
          configuration and detection of devices, and the services offered by

          by so-called "constrained resource" devices (i.e., those with
          limited processing power, memory, and power resources).</t>

          <t>In general, service discovery is concerned with the resolution
          and distribution of hostnames via <xref

          <t>Resource Discovery is concerned with the discovery of resources
          offered by end-points and is extremely important in
          machine-to-machine closed-loop applications (i.e., those with no
          humans in the loop). The goals of resource discover protocols
          include: <list>
              <t>Simplicity of creation and maintenance of resources</t>

              <t>Commonly understood semantics</t>

          <t>The <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap">Constrained Application
          Protocol (CoAP)</xref> is being developed in IETF with these goals
          in mind. In particular, CoAP is designed for use in constrained
          resource networks and for machine-to-machine applications such as
          smart energy and building automation. It provides a RESTful transfer
          protocol <xref target="RESTFUL"></xref>, a built-in resource
          discovery protocol, and includes web concepts such as URIs and
          content-types. CoAP provides both unicast and multicast resource
          discovery and includes the ability to filter on attributes of
          resource descriptions. Finally, CoAP resource discovery can also be
          used to discover HTTP resources.</t>

          <t>For simplicity, CoAP makes the assumption that all CoAP servers
          listen on the default CoAP port or otherwise have been configured or
          discovered using some general service discovery mechanism such as
          <xref target="I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd">DNS Service Discovery
          (DNS-SD)</xref>.</t>

          <t>Resource discovery in CoAP is accomplished through the use of
          well-known resources which describe the links offered by a CoAP
          server. CoAP defines a well-known URI for discovery:
          "/.well-known/r" <xref target="RFC5785"></xref>. For example, the
          query [GET /.well-known/r] returns a list of links (representing
          resources) available from the queried CoAP server. A query such as
          [GET /.well-known/r?n=Voltage] returns the resources with the name
          Voltage.</t>

          protocol for creating, modifying and terminating multimedia sessions
          on the Internet, meant to be more scalable than H.323. Multimedia
          sessions can be voice, video, instant messaging, shared data, and/or
          subscriptions of events. SIP can run on top of TCP, UDP, SCTP, or
          TLS over TCP. SIP is independent of the transport layer, and
          independent of the underlying IPv4/v6 version. In fact, the
          transport protocol used can change as the SIP message traverses SIP
          entities from source to destination.</t>

          <t>SIP itself does not choose whether a session is voice or video,
          the <xref target="RFC4566">SDP: Session Description Protocol</xref>
          is intended for that purpose and to identify the actual endpoints'
          IP addresses. Within the SDP, which is transported by SIP, codecs
          are offered and accepted (or not), the port number and IP address is
          decided for where each endpoint wants to receive their <xref
          target="RFC3550">Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)</xref> packets.
          This part is critical to understand because of the affect on Network
          Address Translators, or NATs. Unless a NAT (with or without a
          firewall) is designed to be SDP aware (i.e., looking into each
          packet far enough to discover what the IP address and port number is
          for this particular session - and resetting it based on the <xref
          target="RFC5389">Session Traversal Utilities for NAT</xref>, the
          session established by SIP will not result in RTP packets being sent
          to the proper endpoint (in SIP called a user agent, or UA). It
          should be noted that SIP messaging has no issues with NATs, it is
          just the UA's inability to generally learn about the presence of the
          NATs that prevent the RTP packets from being received by the UA
          establishing the session.</t>

             title="A simplified view of the business architecture">
      <t>The Internet is a network of networks in which networks are
      interconnected in specific ways and are independently operated. It is
      important to note that the underlying Internet architecture puts no
      restrictions on the ways that networks are interconnected;
      interconnection is a business decision. As such, the Internet
      interconnection architecture can be thought of as a "business structure"
      for the Internet.</t>

      <t>Central to the Internet business structure are the networks that
      provide connectivity to other networks, called "Transit Networks". These
      networks sell bulk bandwidth and routing services to each other and to
      other networks as customers. Around the periphery of the transit network
      are companies, schools, and other networks that provide services
      directly to individuals. These might generally be divided into
      "Enterprise Networks" and "Access Networks"; Enterprise networks provide
      "free" connectivity to their own employees or members, and also provide
      them a set of services including electronic mail, web services, and so
      on. Access Networks sell broadband connectivity (DSL, Cable Modem,
      802.11 wireless or 3GPP wireless), or "dial" services including PSTN
      dial-up and ISDN, to subscribers. The subscribers are typically either
      residential or small office/home office (SOHO) customers. Residential
      customers are generally entirely dependent on their access provider for
      all services, while a SOHO buys some services from the access provider
      and may provide others for itself. Networks that sell transit services
      to nobody else - SOHO, residential, and enterprise networks - are
      generally refereed to as "edge networks"; Transit Networks are
      considered to be part of the "core" of the Internet, and access networks
      are between the two. This general structure is depicted in <xref

      <t>Another specific example could be shown in a traceroute from the home
      through a Virtual Private Network (VPN tunnel) from the home, crossing
      Cox Cable (an Access Network) and Pacific Bell (a Transit Network), and
      terminating in Cisco Systems (an Enterprise Network); a traceroute of
      the path doesn't show that as it is invisible within the VPN and the
      contents of the VPN are invisible, due to encryption, to the networks on
      the path. Instead, the traceroute in <xref target="enterprise"></xref>
      is entirely within Cisco's internal network.</t>

      <t>Note that in both cases, the home network uses private address space
      <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> while other networks generally use public
      address space, and that three middleware technologies are in use here.
      These are the use of a firewall, a Network Address Translator (NAT), and
      a Virtual Private Network (VPN).</t>

      <t>Firewalls are generally sold as and considered by many to be a
      security technology. This is based on the fact that a firewall imposes a
      border between two administrative domains. Typically a firewall will be
      deployed between a residential, SOHO, or enterprise network and its
      access or transit provider. In its essence, a firewall is a data diode,
      imposing a policy on what sessions may pass between a protected domain
      and the rest of the Internet. Simple policies generally permit sessions
      to be originated from the protected network but not from the outside;
      more complex policies may permit additional sessions from the outside,
      as electronic mail to a mail server or a web session to a web server,
      and may prevent certain applications from global access even though they
      are originated from the inside.</t>

      <t>Note that the effectiveness of firewalls remains controversial. While
      network managers often insist on deploying firewalls as they impose a
      boundary, others point out that their value as a security solution is
      debatable. This is because most attacks come from behind the firewall.
      In addition, firewalls do not protect against application layer attacks
      such as viruses carried in email. Thus as a security solution firewalls
      are justified as a defense in depth. That is, while an end system must
      in the end be responsible for its own security, a firewall can inhibit
      or prevent certain kinds of attacks, for example the consumption of CPU
      time on a critical server.</t>

      <t>Key documents describing firewall technology and the issues it poses
      include: <list style="symbols">
          <t><xref target="RFC2588">IP Multicast and Firewalls</xref></t>

      <t>Network Address Translation is a technology that was developed in
      response to ISP behaviors in the mid-1990's; when <xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref> was published, many ISPs started handing out
      single or small numbers of addresses, and edge networks were forced to
      translate. In time, this became considered a good thing, or at least not
      a bad thing; it amplified the public address space, and it was sold as
      if it were a firewall. It of course is not; while traditional dynamic
      NATs only translate between internal and external session address/aport
      tuples during the detected duration of the session, that session state
      may exist in the network much longer than it exists on the end system,
      and as a result constitutes an attack vector. The design, value, and
      limitations of network address translation are described in: <list

      <t>Virtual Private Networks come in many forms; what they have in common
      is that they are generally tunneled over the internet backbone, so that
      as in <xref target="enterprise"></xref>, connectivity appears to be
      entirely within the edge network although it is in fact across a service
      provider's network. Examples include IPsec tunnel-mode encrypted
      tunnels, IP-in-IP or GRE tunnels and <xref target="RFC3031">MPLS

      <t>This appendix provides a worked example of the use of the Internet
      Protocol Suite in a network such as the Smart Grid's Advanced Metering
      Infrastructure (AMI). There are several possible models.</t>

      <t><xref target="ami"></xref> shows the structure of the AMI as it
      reaches out towards a set of residences. In this structure, we have the
      home itself and its Home Area Network (HAN), the Neighborhood Area
      Network (NAN) that the utility uses to access the meter at the home, and
      the utility access network that connects a set of NANs to the utility
      itself. For the purposes of this discussion, assume that the NAN
      contains a distributed application in a set collectors, which is of
      course only one way the application could be implemented.</t>

      <t>There are several questions that have to be answered in describing
      this picture, which given possible answers yield different possible
      models. They include at least: <list style="symbols">
          <t>How does Demand Response work? Either: <list style="symbols">

              <t>The utility adjusts settings on individual appliances within
              the home.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>How does the utility access meters at the home? <list
              style="symbols">
              <t>The AMI Headend manages the interfaces with the meters,
              collecting metering data and passing it on to the appropriate
              applications over the Enterprise Bus, or</t>

              <t>Distributed application support (collectors") might access
              and summarize the information; this device might be managed by

              customers.</t>
            </list></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In implementation, these models are idealized; reality may include
      some aspects of each model in specified cases.</t>

      <t>The examples include: <list style="numbers">
          <t><xref target="example1"></xref> presumes that the HAN, the NAN,

          <t><xref target="example3"></xref> repeats the first example, but
          presuming that the collector directly forwards traffic as a router
          in addition to distributed application chores. Note that this case
          implies numerous privacy and security concerns and as such is
          considered a less likely deployment model.</t>

      <section anchor="han-structure" title="How to structure a network">
        <t>A key consideration in the Internet has been the development of new
        link layer technologies over time. The ARPANET originally used a BBN
        proprietary link layer called BBN 1822 <xref target="1822"></xref>. In
        the late 1970's, the ARPANET switched to X.25 as an interface to the
        1822 network. With the deployment of the IEEE 802 series technologies
        in the early 1980's, IP was deployed on Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), Token
        Ring (IEEE 802.5) and WiFi (IEEE 802.11), as well as Arcnet, serial
        lines of various kinds, Frame Relay, and ATM. A key issue in this
        evolution was that the applications developed to run on the Internet
        use APIs related to the IPS, and as a result require little or no
        change to continue to operate in a new link layer architecture or a
        mixture of them.</t>

        <t>The Smart Grid is likely to see a similar evolution over time.
        Consider the Home Area Network (HAN) as a readily understandable small
        network. At this juncture, technologies proposed for residential
        networks include IEEE P1901, various versions of IEEE 802.15.4, and
        IEEE 802.11. It is reasonable to expect other technologies to be
        developed in the future. As the Zigbee Alliance has learned (and as a
        resulted incorporated the IPS in Smart Energy Profile 2.0), there is
        significant value in providing a virtual address that is mapped to
        interfaces or nodes attached to each of those technologies.</t>

        <t>There are two possible communication models within the HAN, both of
        which are likely to be useful. Devices may communicate directly with
        each other, or they may be managed by some central controller. An
        example of direct communications might be a light switch that directly
        commands a lamp to turn on or off. An example of indirect
        communications might be a control application in a Customer or
        Building that accepts telemetry from a thermostat, applies some form
        of policy, and controls the heating and air conditioning systems. In
        addition, there are high end appliances in the market today that use
        residential broadband to communicate with their manufacturers, and
        obviously the meter needs to communicate with the utility.</t>

        <t><xref target="han-ems-router"></xref> shows two simple networks,
        one of which IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 1901 domains, and one of which
        uses an arbitrary LAN within the home, which could be IEEE
        802.3/Ethernet, IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 1901, IEEE 802.11, or anything
        else that made sense in context. Both show the connectivity between
        them as a router separate from the EMS. This is for clarity; the two
        could of course be incorporated into a single system, and one could
        imagine appliances that want to communicate with their manufacturers
        supporting both a HAN interface and a WiFi interface rather than
        depending on the router. These are all manufacturer design
        decisions.</t>

        <section title="HAN Routing">
          <t>The HAN can be seen as communicating with two kinds of non-HAN
          networks. One is the home LAN, which may in turn be attached to the
          Internet, and will generally either derive its prefix from the
          upstream ISP or use a self-generated ULA. Another is the utility's
          NAN, which through an ESI provides utility connectivity to the HAN;
          in this case the HAN will be addressed by a self-generated ULA
          (note, however, that in some cases ESI may also provide a prefix via
          <xref target="RFC3315">DHCP</xref>). In addition, the HAN will have
          link-local addresses that can be used between neighboring nodes. In
          general, an HAN will be comprised of both 802.15.4, 802.11 (and
          possibly other) networks.</t>

          <t>The ESI is a node on the user's residential network, and will not
          typically provide stateful packet forwarding or firewall services
          between the HAN and the utility network(s). In general, the ESI is a
          node on the home network; in some cases, the meter may act as the
          ESI. However, the ESI must be capable of understanding that most
          home networks are not 802.15.4 enabled (rather, they are typically
          802.11 networks), and that it must be capable of setting up ad-hoc
          networks between various sensors in the home (e.g., betweeen the
          meter and say, a thermostat) in the event there aren't other
          networks available.</t>

        <section anchor="han-security" title="HAN Security">
          <t>In any network, we have a variety of threats and a variety of
          possible mitigations. These include, at minimum: <list
              style="hanging">
              <t hangText="Link Layer:">Why is your machine able to talk in my
              network? The WiFi SSIDs often use some form of authenticated
              access control, which may be a simple encrypted password
              mechanism or may use a combination of encryption and IEEE
              802.1X+EAP-TLS Authentication/Authorization to ensure that only
              authorized communicants can use it. If a LAN has a router
              attached, the router may also implement a firewall to filter
              remote accesses.</t>

              <t hangText="Network Layer:">Given that your machine is
              authorized access to my network, why is your machine talking
              with my machine? IPsec is a way of ensuring that computers that
              can use a network are allowed to talk with each other, may also
              enforce confidentiality, and may provide VPN services to make a
              device or network appear to be part of a remote network.</t>

              <t hangText="Application:">Given that your machine is authorized
              access to my network and my machine, why is your application
              talking with my application? The fact that your machine and mine
              are allowed to talk for some applications doesn't mean they are
              allowed to for all applications. (D)TLS, https, and other such
              mechanisms enable an application to impose
              application-to-application controls similar to the network layer
              controls provided by IPsec.</t>

              <t hangText="Remote Application:">How do I know that the data I
              received is the data you sent? Especially in applications like
              electronic mail, where data passes through a number of
              intermediaries that one may or may not really want munging it
              (how many times have you seen a URL broken by a mail server?),
              we have tools (DKIM, S/MIME, and W3C XML Signatures to name a
              few) to provide non-repudiability and integrity verification.
              This may also have legal ramifications: if a record of a meter
              reading is to be used in billing, and the bill is disputed in
              court, one could imagine the court wanting proof that the record
              in fact came from that meter at that time and contained that
              data.</t>

              <t hangText="Application-specific security:">In addition,
              applications often provide security services of their own. The
              fact that I can access a file system, for example, doesn't mean
              that I am authorized to access everything in it; the file system
              may well prevent my access to some of its contents. Routing
              protocols like BGP obsess with the question "what statements
              that my peer made am I willing to believe". And monitoring
              protocols like SNMP may not be willing to answer every question
              they are asked, depending on access configuration.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Devices in the HAN want controlled access to the LAN in question
          for obvious reasons. In addition, there should be some form of
          mutual authentication between devices - the lamp controller will
          want to know that the light switch telling it to change state is the
          right light switch, for example. The EMS may well want strong
          authentication of accesses - the parents may not want the children
          changing the settings, and while the utility and the customer are
          routinely granted access, other parties (especially parties with
          criminal intent) need to be excluded.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="example1" title="Model 1: AMI with separated domains">
        <t>With the background given in <xref target="han-structure"></xref>,
        we can now discuss the use of IP (IPv4 or IPv6) in the AMI.</t>

        <t>In this first model, consider the three domains in <xref
        target="ami"></xref> to literally be separate administrative domains,
        potentially operated by different entities. For example, the NAN could
        be a WiMAX network operated by a traditional telecom operator, the
        utility's network (including the collector) is its own, and the
        residential network is operated by the resident. In this model, while
        communications between the collector and the Meter are normal, the
        utility has no other access to appliances in the home, and the
        collector doesn't directly forward messages from the NAN upstream.</t>

        <t>In this case, as shown in <xref target="han-ems-router"></xref>, it
        would make the most sense to design the collector, the Meter, and the
        EMS as hosts on the NAN - design them as systems whose applications
        can originate and terminate exchanges or sessions in the NAN, but not
        forward traffic from or to other devices.</t>

        <t>In such a configuration, Demand Response has to be performed by
        having the EMS accept messages such as price signals from the "pole
        top", apply some form of policy, and then orchestrate actions within
        the home. Another possibility is to have the EMS communicate with the
        ESI located in the meter. If the thermostat has high demand and low
        demand (day/night or morning/day/evening/night) settings, Demand
        Response might result in it moving to a lower demand setting, and the
        EMS might also turn off specified circuits in the home to diminish
        lighting.</t>

        <t>In this scenario, Quality of Service (QoS) issues reportedly arise
        when high precedence messages must be sent through the collector to
        the home; if the collector is occupied polling the meters or doing
        some other task, the application may not yield control of the
        processor to the application that services the message. Clearly, this
        is either an application or an Operating System problem; applications
        need to be designed in a manner that doesn't block high precedence
        messages. The collector also needs to use appropriate NAN services, if
        they exist, to provide the NAN QoS it needs. For example, if WiMax is
        in use, it might use a routine-level service for normal exchanges but
        a higher precedence service for these messages.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="example2"
               title="Model 2: AMI with neighborhood access to the home">
        <t>In this second model, let's imagine that the utility directly
        accesses appliances within the HAN. Rather than expect an EMS to
        respond to price signals in Demand Response, it directly commands
        devices like air conditioners to change state, or throws relays on
        circuits to or within the home.</t>

        <t>In this case, as shown in <xref target="han-nan-router"></xref>,
        the Meter, and EMS as hosts on the HAN, and there is a router between
        the HAN and the NAN.</t>

        <t>As one might imagine, there are serious security considerations in
        this model. Traffic between the NAN and the residential broadband
        network should be filtered, and the issues raised in <xref
        target="han-security"></xref> take on a new level of meaning. One of
        the biggest threats may be a legal or at least a public relations
        issue; if the utility intentionally disables a circuit in a manner or
        at a time that threatens life (the resident's kidney dialysis machine
        is on it, or a respirator, for example) the matter might make the
        papers. Unauthorized access could be part of juvenile pranks or other
        things as well. So one really wants the appliances to only obey
        commands under strict authentication/authorization controls.</t>

        <t>In addition to the QoS issues raised in <xref
        target="example1"></xref>, there is the possibility of queuing issues
        in the router. In such a case, the IP datagrams should probably use
        the Low-Latency Data Service Class described in <xref
        target="RFC4594"></xref>, and let other traffic use the Standard
        Service Class or other service classes.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="example3" title="Model 3: Collector is an IP router">
        <t>In this third model, the relationship between the NAN and the HAN
        is either as in <xref target="example1"></xref> or <xref
        target="example2"></xref>; what is different is that the collector may
        be an IP router. In addition to whatever autonomous activities it is
        doing, it forwards traffic as an IP router in some cases.</t>

        <t>As and analogous to <xref target="example2"></xref>, there are
        serious security considerations in this model. Traffic being forwarded
        should be filtered, and the issues raised in <xref
        target="han-security"></xref> take on a new level of meaning - but
        this time at the utility mainframe. Unauthorized access is likely
        similar to other financially-motivated attacks that happen in the
        Internet, but presumably would be coming from devices in the HAN that
        have been co-opted in some way. One really wants the appliances to
        only obey commands under strict authentication/authorization
        controls.</t>

        <t>In addition to the QoS issues raised in <xref
        target="example1"></xref>, there is the possibility of queuing issues
        in the collector. In such a case, the IP datagrams should probably use
        the Low-Latency Data Service Class described in <xref
        target="RFC4594"></xref>, and let other traffic use the Standard
        Service Class or other service classes.</t>
