           Bulk Binding Update Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6
               draft-ietf-netext-bulk-re-registration-09

Abstract

   For extending the lifetime of a mobility session, the Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 specification requires the mobile access gateway to send a Proxy
   Binding Update message to the local mobility anchor on a per-session
   basis.  In the absence of signaling semantics for performing
   operations with group specific scope, it results in significant
   amount of signaling traffic on a periodic basis between a given
   mobile access gateway and a local mobility anchor.  This document
   defines an optimization to the binding update and revocation
   operations in Proxy Mobile IPv6 for performing operations with group
   specific scope with the use of a group identifier.

1.  Introduction

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 base specification [RFC5213] requires the
   Mobile Node Identifier option to be present in the mobility signaling
   messages, such as in the Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement messages.  It essentially limits the operational
   scope of the signaling messages to a single mobility session.  These
   signaling messages lack the capability to identify a group of
   mobility sessions which have a common characteristic so as to perform
   operations on the entire group.

   There is a need to have semantics for defining a group affiliation
   for a mobility session, in order to allow relevant protocol
   operations to be performed on the entire group.  The use of a group
   identifier in protocol operations can extend the scope of the
   operation to the entire group.  The group identifier therefore
   provides a more optimal mechanism for protocol operations which would
   otherwise require multiple atomic transactions on a per mobile node
   basis.  Following are some of the use-cases where the group
   identifier can be used.

   o  For extending the lifetime of all the mobility sessions that are
      part of a group, the mobile access gateway can potentially send a
      single Proxy Binding Update message to the local mobility anchor,
      by including a group identifier that identifies all the mobility
      sessions that are part of that group.  The local mobility anchor
      upon accepting the request can update the lifetime of all the
      mobility sessions that are part of that group.

   o  In a blade architecture system running the local mobility anchor
      service, all the mobile node sessions anchored on a given card can
      belong to a single group.  When a failure occurs on a specific
      card, the local mobility anchor can initiate the revocation
      signaling to the mobile access gateway by sending a single
      revocation request carrying the group identifier.

   o  The mobile access gateway, or the local mobility anchor can choose
      to revoke all the mobility sessions belonging to a specific group.
      In such cases the mobile access gateway or the local mobility
      anchor can perform the binding revocation signaling using the
      group identifier associated with a specific set of mobile nodes.

   This document defines a new mobility option, Mobile Node Group
   Identifier option, which can be used in binding update and binding
   revocation related operations, for performing operations with group
   specific scope.

2.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications
   [RFC5213] and [RFC5844].  Additionally, this document uses the
   following abbreviations:

   Bulk Binding Update

      A binding update operation that has group specific scope.  A
      binding operation is associated with a specific mobility session.
      However, a Bulk binding update operation is associated with
      multiple mobility sessions.  This operation is not relevant for
      new mobility session(s) creations.

   Bulk Binding Update Group

      A group of mobility sessions that are part of the same logical
      group and therefore share a common group identifier.  This group
      is the bulk binding update group.  The mobility entities can
      perform binding update related operations such as lifetime
      extension and revocation operations on this entire group,
      identified by bulk binding update group identifier.


3.  Bulk Binding Update Overview

3.1.  Motivation

   In a typical Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, a local mobility anchor serves
   multiple mobile access gateways and the capacity of that node with
   respect to the number of mobility sessions that it can host is quite
   high, typically in the order of few millions.  As the number of
   mobility sessions hosted by a local mobility anchor goes up, so is
   the amount of signaling traffic related to periodic binding update
   related traffic.

   The currently specified approach of binding update procedure for
   extending the lifetime, where the mobile access gateway is required
   to send a unique binding update message for each mobility session,

   even when there is no change to the session state is inefficient or
   sub-optimal.  These periodic binding update messages consume
   significant amount of network resources, both in terms of processing
   power and in terms of network bandwidth and at both the peers.  There
   is an opportunity to optimize the signaling procedures by allowing
   the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway to perform
   bulk binding update operations.  This document specifies extensions
   to Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling for performing binding update and
   revocation operations on a group on mobility sessions.  These
   extensions do not take away the existing functionality of performing
   binding operations on a single mobility session.

3.2.  General Operation

   The bulk binding update mechanism specified in this document allows
   the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor to perform
   binding update and revocation operations on a group of mobility
   sessions.  As part of the initial signaling during mobility session
   establishment, the local mobility anchor and the mobile access
   gateway exchange the respective bulk binding update group identifiers
   for that mobility session.  Subsequently both the peers can perform
   bulk operations on those groups by presenting the bulk binding update
   group identifier in the signaling messages.

   A mobile access gateway when sending a Proxy Binding Update message
   after detecting a new mobile node on its access link, can request the
   local mobility anchor to assign a bulk binding update group
   identifier for the mobile node's mobility session.  This is indicated
   by setting the (B) flag in the Proxy Binding Update to a value of
   (1).  The mobile access gateway will also assign a bulk binding
   update group identifier (or it may assign a default bulk binding
   update group - ALL-Sessions) and include that in the Mobile Node
   Group Identifier option.

   The local mobility anchor upon accepting the request will group the
   mobility session to a specific bulk binding update group (or it may
   assign it to the default bulk binding update group - ALL-Sessions)
   and return this bulk binding update group identifier in Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement message.  It will also set the (B) flag in the Proxy
   Binding Acknowledgement message to a value of (1).  The bulk binding
   update group identifier is carried in the Mobile Node Group
   Identifier option, described in Section 4.3.

   Once the bulk binding update group identifiers are exchanged, the
   local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway can perform
   binding operations on those entire groups, by including the bulk
   binding update group identifier in the signaling messages.  For
   example, the mobile access gateway can extend the lifetime of all the

   mobility sessions that are part of a group by sending a single Proxy
   Binding Update message with that bulk binding update group
   identifier.  Similarly, the local mobility anchor can revoke all the
   mobility sessions that are part of a group, by including that group
   identifier in the Proxy Binding Revocation message.

   Figure 1 explains the operational sequence of the bulk binding update
   and revocation operations on a group of mobile nodes, MN1, MN2 and
   MN3.

   o  (1) to (2): MAG detects the mobile node's (MN1) attachment to the
      access link.  The MAG groups the mobile node to a specific bulk
      binding update group, (M1).  The MAG notifies this group
      identifier to the LMA by including it in the Mobile Node Group

      Identifier option of the PBU message.

   o  (3): The LMA upon accepting the PBU, creates a mobility session
      and groups the mobility session to a specific bulk binding update
      group, (L1).  The LMA updates the mobile node's BCE entry to
      include the bulk binding update group identifier, (L1) and the
      bulk binding update group identifier presented by the MAG, (M1).
      The LMA also notifies the MAG about the bulk binding update group
      identifier (L1), by including it in the PBA.

   o  (4) to (5): The MAG upon receiving the PBA updates the BUL entry
      for that mobility session to include the bulk binding update group
      identifiers (L1) and (M1).  At this point, both the LMA and MAG
      are aware of the mobile node's bulk binding update group
      identifiers assigned by the peers.

   o  (6) to (9): The above steps (1 through 5) are repeated here for
      MN2 and MN3, details are omitted.  At the end of step (9), the MAG
      completes the signaling with the LMA.  The MAG assigns the mobile
      nodes, MN2 and MN3 to bulk binding update groups, M1 and M2
      respectively, while the LMA assigns them both to the same to the
      bulk binding update group, (L1).

   o  At this point, LMA has assigned MN1, MN2 and MN3 to the bulk
      binding update group of (L1), while the MAG has assigned MN1 and
      MN2 to the group (M1) and MN3 to group (M2).  Both the peers can
      now perform binding operations on a group of mobility sessions
      identified by the respective bulk binding update group identifier.

   o  (10) to (13): The MAG sends a periodic binding update message for
      extending the lifetime of all the mobility sessions that are part
      of the bulk binding update group, (M1).  It includes the bulk
      binding update group identifier, (M1) in the PBU.  The LMA upon
      accepting the PBU, extends the lifetime of both MN1 and MN2, which
      are part of the group (M1).

   o  (14) to (16): The LMA decides to revoke all the sessions that are
      part of bulk binding update group, L1.  The LMA sends a BRI
      message with the bulk binding update group identifier, (L1).  The
      MAG upon accepting the BRI message revokes all the MN1, MN2 and
      MN3 mobility sessions, which are part of that bulk binding update
      group, (L1).

   A new flag, Bulk-Binding-Update (B) flag is defined in the Proxy
   Binding Update message specified in [RFC5213].  The bit-value of
   Bulk-Binding-Update (B) flag in the flags field of the message will
   be (IANA-1).

   If the Bulk-Binding-Update flag (B) is set to a value of (1), it
   informs the local mobility anchor to assign the mobile node's
   mobility session to the bulk binding operation group.  If the (B)
   flag is set to a value of (0), the local mobility anchor MUST exclude
   the mobile node's mobility session from the bulk binding operation
   group and thus any any binding update, or binding revocation
   operations with bulk scope will not be applied to that mobility
   session.  This flag MUST be set to value of (0), when the (P) flag is
   set to a value of (0).

   All other fields in the Proxy Binding Update message and the mobility
   options that can be carried in the message confirm to the respective
   specifications.

              Figure 3: Proxy Binding Acknowledgment Message

   A new flag, Bulk-Binding-Update (B) flag is defined in the Proxy
   Binding Acknowledgment message specified in [RFC5213].  The bit-value
   of Bulk-Binding-Update (B) flag in the flags field of the message is
   (IANA-2).

   If the Bulk-Binding-Update flag (B) is set to a value of (1), it
   serves as an indication to the mobile access gateway that the mobile
   node's mobility session was successfully added to the bulk binding
   operation group.  The value of the flag MUST be set to the value of
   (0), if the value of the (B) flag in the Proxy Binding Update message
   that it received from the mobile access gateway was set to a value of
   (0).  This flag MUST be set to value of (0), when the (P) flag is set
   to a value of (0).

   All other fields in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message and the
   mobility options that can be carried in the message conform to the
   respective specifications.

4.3.  Mobile Node Group Identifier Option

   A new option, Mobile Node Group Identifier option is defined for
   using it in Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling messages exchanged between a
   local mobility anchor and a mobile access gateway.  This option is
   used for carrying the mobile node's group identifier.  There can be
   multiple instances of this option in a given signaling message,
   however, each of the instance SHOULD have a different sub-type value.
   This option is a generic option and this specification uses only the
   sub-type value of (1).  The alignment requirement for this option is
   4n.

      of all mobility sessions established between a given local
      mobility anchor and mobile access gateway.

   The group identifier reflects the group affiliation of a mobile node.

4.4.  Status Codes

   This document defines the following new Status codes values for use
   in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message.  These values are to be
   allocated from the same numbering space, as defined in Section 6.1.8
   of [RFC6275].

5.  Protocol Considerations

5.1.  MAG Considerations

   The following considerations MUST be applied by the mobile access
   gateway when supporting this specification.

   The conceptual Binding Update List entry data structure maintained by
   the mobile access gateway, described in Section 6.1 of [RFC5213],
   MUST be extended to include the mobile node's bulk binding update
   group identifiers, LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id and MAG-Bulk-
   Binding-Update-Group-Id.  The LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id is the
   bulk binding update group identifier of that mobility session at the
   local mobility anchor, and which is received in the Mobile Node Group
   Identifier option of the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message.  The
   MAG-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id is the bulk binding update group
   identifier assigned locally by the mobile access gateway for that
   mobility session.

   The mobile access gateway SHOULD maintain a global list, which
   identifies the list of bulk binding update group specific to each
   local mobility anchor.  Example: LMA-1(G1, G2) LMA-2(G3, G2).

5.1.1.  Enabling Bulk Binding Operation Support for a Mobility Session

   The following section identifies the considerations for the mobile
   access gateway for exchanging the mobile node's group identifiers in
   the Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages.
   It should be noted that these considerations are relevant only during
   the establishment of a specific mobility session and are not relevant
   when initiating bulk binding updates on a group of mobility sessions.

   o  When sending a Proxy Binding Update message to the local mobility
      anchor, the mobile access gateway MAY choose to request the local
      mobility anchor to enable bulk binding update support for the
      mobility session associated with that Proxy Binding Update
      request.  When making such request, the Bulk-Binding-Update flag
      (B) in the request MUST be set to a value of (1) and the Mobile
      Node Identifier [RFC4283] option MUST be present.  The decision to
      request the bulk binding update support for a mobile node is a
      matter of local policy at the mobile access gateway and is
      controlled by the configuration variable,
      RequestBulkBindingUpdateSupportForMobilitySession.

   o  The mobile access gateway SHOULD also assign a bulk binding update
      group identifier for the mobile node based on its own grouping
      considerations.  When such grouping is done, the mobile access
      gateway SHOULD send the assigned group identifier by including



Abinader, et al.          Expires July 5, 2012                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft         Bulk Binding Update Support          January 2012


      this identifier in the Mobile Node Group Identifier option of the
      Proxy Binding Update message.  If there is no such grouping is
      done, the mobile access gateway SHOULD include the default group
      identifier value of (ALL-SESSIONS) in the Mobile Node Group
      Identifier option.

   o  When sending the Mobile Node Group Identifier option in the
      binding update messages related to the individual session
      establishment, the Bulk-Binding-Update (B) flag in the request
      MUST be set to a value of (1).  However, when initiating any
      binding update operations with group specific scope, the Bulk-
      Binding-Update (B) flag in the request MUST always be set to a
      value of (0), with the Mobile Node Group Identifier option present
      in the request.

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message has the Bulk-
      Binding-Update flag (B) in the reply set to a value of (0), this
      is in response to a Proxy Binding Update request with the Bulk-
      Binding-Update flag (B) set to a value of (1), it is an indication
      that the local mobility anchor has denied the request for
      supporting bulk binding update operations for that mobility
      session and that the mobility session is not associated with any
      bulk binding operation group.  The mobile access gateway SHOULD
      set the bulk binding update group identifier values, LMA-Bulk-
      Binding-Update-Group-Id and MAG-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id
      values to (0).  Furthermore, the mobility session should be
      excluded from any bulk binding update operations.

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message has the
      status code value set to (0) (Proxy Binding Update accepted), the
      Bulk-Binding-Update flag (B) in the reply is set to a value of
      (1), it is an indication that the local mobility anchor has
      accepted the request to allow bulk binding updates on that
      mobility session.  Furthermore, the Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option in the reply contains the bulk binding update group
      identifier for that mobility session assigned by the local
      mobility anchor.  The mobile access gateway SHOULD update the LMA-
      Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id in the Binding Update List entry with
      the Identifier present in the received option.  However, if the
      received Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message has the Bulk-
      Binding-Update flag (B) set to a value of (1), but if the Mobile
      Node Group Identifier option is not present, the message MUST be
      considered as malformed and ignored.

   o  At any point of time, the mobile access gateway chooses to request
      the local mobility anchor to disable bulk binding update support
      for a mobility session, it MUST send a Proxy Binding Update
      message with the (B) flag set to a value of (0) and by including

      the Mobile Node Identifier [RFC4283] option.  This message is sent
      as a normal binding update request for lifetime extension.
      Considerations from section 6.9.1 [RFC5213] MUST be applied.

5.1.2.  Supporting Bulk Binding Updates

   The following section identifies the considerations for mobile access
   gateway for performing binding update and revocation operations with
   group specific scope.

   o  For extending the lifetime of all mobility sessions that share the
      same bulk binding update group identifier, the mobile access
      gateway MAY choose to send a Bulk binding update request.  For
      making such request, it can send a Proxy Binding Update message to
      the local mobility anchor, including the Mobile Node Group
      Identifier option with sub-type value of (1) (bulk binding update
      group), and with the Bulk-Binding-Update flag (B) set to a value
      of (0).  The identifier value in the option MUST be set to the
      bulk binding update group identifier of the group for which bulk
      binding update operation is being requested.  The message MUST NOT
      include any individual session identifiers such as, Mobile Node
      Identifier option [RFC5213], Home Network Prefix option [RFC5213],
      the IPv4 Home Address Request option [RFC5844], or the GRE Key
      option [RFC5845].  All the Considerations from section 5.3.3
      [RFC5213] MUST be followed when sending this request, with
      exception related to the use of Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option in place of the individual session identifiers.

   o  When requesting binding revocation for all the sessions that share
      the same bulk binding update group identifier, the mobile access
      gateway MAY choose to send a Bulk revocation request.  For making
      such request, it can send a Binding Revocation Indication message
      to the local mobility anchor, including the Mobile Node Group
      Identifier option, with sub-type value of (1) (bulk binding update
      group).  The identifier value in the option MUST be set to the
      bulk binding update group identifier of the group for which bulk
      binding update operation is being requested.  The message MUST NOT
      include any individual session identifiers such as, Mobile Node
      Identifier option [RFC5213], Home Network Prefix option [RFC5213],
      the IPv4 Home Address Request option [RFC5844] or the GRE Key
      option [RFC5845].  All the Considerations from section 9.2
      [RFC5846] MUST be followed when sending this request, with
      exception related to the use of Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option in place of the individual session identifiers.

   o  Any time the mobile access gateway receives a Binding Revocation
      Indication Message [RFC5846], with a Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option present in the request and with sub-type value of (1) (bulk



Abinader, et al.          Expires July 5, 2012                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft         Bulk Binding Update Support          January 2012


      binding update group), the mobile access gateway MUST consider the
      request as a bulk revocation request, with the request scope for
      revoking of all the mobility sessions that share the same bulk
      binding update group identifier (present in the Mobile Node Group
      Identifier option).  However, if the received request also
      includes a Mobile Node Identifier option [RFC5213], Home Network
      Prefix option [RFC5213], the IPv4 Home Address Request option
      [RFC5844], or the GRE Key Option [RFC5845], the mobile access
      gateway MUST consider this as an invalid message; it MUST reject
      the Binding Revocation Indication message and send a Binding
      Revocation Acknowledgement message with the Status field set to a
      value of 128 (Binding Does NOT Exist).  All the considerations
      from [RFC5846] apply when processing binding revocation request,
      except making the scope of the operation apply to a set of
      mobility sessions identified by the bulk binding update group
      identifier present in the request.

5.2.  LMA Considerations

   For supporting this specification, the following considerations MUST
   be applied by the local mobility anchor when processing Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 signaling messages.

   The conceptual Binding Cache entry data structure maintained by the
   local mobility anchor, described in Section 6.1 of [RFC5213], MUST be
   extended to include the mobile node's bulk binding update group
   identifiers, LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id and MAG-Bulk-Binding-
   Update-Group-Id.  These are 32-bit unsigned integer values.  The MAG-
   Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id reflects the bulk binding update group
   identifier assigned by the mobile access gateway and which is
   received in the Proxy Binding Update message.  The LMA-Bulk-Binding-
   Update-Group-Id is the bulk binding update group identifier assigned
   locally by the local mobility anchor.

5.2.1.  Enabling Bulk Binding Operation Support for a Mobility Session

   This section identifies the considerations for local mobility anchor
   for assigning a bulk binding update group identifier to a mobility
   session.

   o  The local mobility anchor will process a received Proxy Binding
      Update message as specified in [RFC5213].  However, if the (B)
      flag in the received Proxy Binding Update message is set to a
      value of (1) and if it includes a Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option with sub-type value of (1) (bulk binding update group), the
      local mobility anchor MUST apply the following additional
      considerations.




Abinader, et al.          Expires July 5, 2012                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         Bulk Binding Update Support          January 2012


   o  If the (B) flag in the received Proxy Binding Update message is
      set to a value of (1) and with the Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option is present in the request, the message serves as a request
      to the local mobility anchor to include the mobile node's session
      to the bulk binding update group.

   o  Upon successful processing and acceptance of the Proxy Binding
      Update, the local mobility anchor MAY choose to enable bulk
      binding update support for this mobility session.  The decision
      whether to enable bulk binding update support for that mobility
      session is a matter of local policy and is controlled by the
      configuration variable, AcceptBulkBindingUpdateReqMobilitySession.

   o  For enabling the bulk binding update support for the mobility
      session, the local mobility anchor SHOULD associate the mobility
      session to a specific bulk binding update group locally.  The
      specific details on how the local mobility anchor associates the
      given mobility session to a specific bulk binding update group is
      outside the scope of this document.  The local mobility anchor MAY
      choose to assign a default bulk binding update group identifier
      value of (ALL-SESSIONS), indicating that all the mobility sessions
      from that mobile access gateway are part of that group.  The local
      mobility anchor SHOULD update the bulk binding update group
      identifier values in the Binding Cache entry, LMA-Bulk-Binding-
      Update-Group-Id and MAG-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id to the
      respective values.

   o  If the bulk binding update support is enabled for the mobile
      node's mobility session, the local mobility anchor MUST send the
      assigned bulk binding update group identifier as part of the
      Mobile Node Group Identifier option, with sub-type value of (1)
      (bulk binding update group) in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment
      message that it sends to the mobile access gateway.  The (B) flag
      in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message MUST be set to value
      of (1).

   o  If the bulk binding update support is not enabled for the mobile
      node's mobility session, the local mobility anchor MUST NOT
      include the Mobile Node Group Identifier option with a sub-type
      value of (1) in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment reply that it
      sends to the mobile access gateway.  Furthermore, the (B) flag in
      the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment message MUST be set to value of
      (0).  It is to be noted that the Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option is a generic option and new sub-types may be defined by
      future specifications.

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Update message is not a bulk binding
      update request, (i.e., the (B) flag is set to a value of (0) and



Abinader, et al.          Expires July 5, 2012                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft         Bulk Binding Update Support          January 2012


      the Mobile Node Group Identifier option is not present), but is a
      request for extending the lifetime of an existing mobility session
      which is already part of a bulk binding update group, then the
      local mobility anchor MUST process the request as specified in
      [RFC5213].  However, the value of (0) in the (B) flag in the
      message serves as a request for the local mobility anchor to
      remove the session from performing bulk binding update operations.
      Upon accepting the request, the mobility session MUST be removed
      from the bulk binding update group.  The local mobility anchor
      SHOULD set the bulk binding update group identifier values in the
      Binding Cache entry, LMA-Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id and MAG-
      Bulk-Binding-Update-Group-Id values to (0).

   o  Any time the local mobility anchor detects that the mobile node
      has roamed and changed its point of attachment to a new mobile
      access gateway, it SHOULD also update the bulk binding update
      group identifier of the mobility session.  Additionally, it should
      also update the existing group identifiers associated with that
      session.  As part of sending the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment to
      the new mobile access gateway, it MUST include the updated group
      identifier in the Mobile Node Group identifier option.  However,
      if the if the received Proxy Binding Update from the new mobile
      access gateway did not have the (B) flag set to a value of (1),
      then it MUST NOT include the mobility session in any of bulk
      binding update group and MUST NOT include the Mobile Node Group
      identifier option with the sub-type value of (1).

   o  Any time a mobile node's mobility session is de-registered by the
      mobile access gateway, or the session is revoked for
      administrative or any other reasons, the mobility session MUST
      also be removed from the bulk binding update group.

5.2.2.  Supporting Bulk Binding Updates

   The following section identifies the considerations for local
   mobility anchor for performing binding update and revocation
   operations with group specific scope.

   o  Any time the local mobility anchor receives a Proxy Binding Update
      message with the (B) flag in the request is set to a value of (0)
      and if a Mobile Node Group Identifier option present in the
      request and with sub-type value of (1) (bulk binding update
      group), the local mobility anchor MUST consider the request as a
      bulk binding update request, with the request scope for extending
      the lifetime of all the mobility sessions that share the same
      group identifier present in the Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option.  However, if the received request also includes any
      individual session identifiers such as, Mobile Node Identifier

      option [RFC5213], Home Network Prefix option [RFC5213], the IPv4
      Home Address Request option [RFC5844], or the GRE Key option
      [RFC5845] the local mobility anchor MUST consider this as an
      invalid message; it MUST reject the Proxy Binding Update message
      and send a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message with the Status
      field set to INVALID_MOBILE_NODE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER (Invalid group
      identifier value in the request).

   o  The local mobility anchor MUST consider the message as a request
      for extending the lifetime of all the mobility sessions that are
      associated to each of group identifier from the Mobile Node Group
      Identifier option.  There can be multiple instances of the Mobile
      Node Group Identifier option present in the request.  However, the
      group identifier value in each of these options MUST be different.
      Currently, this specification only support sub-type value of (1)
      (bulk binding update group).  If this requirement is not met, the
      local mobility anchor MUST reject the Proxy Binding Update message
      and send a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message with the Status
      field set to INVALID_MOBILE_NODE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER (Invalid group
      identifier value in the request).

   o  Upon accepting the bulk binding update request, the local mobility
      anchor SHOULD extend the lifetime for all the mobility sessions
      that are part of bulk binding update group identified by the group
      identifier in the Mobile Node Group Identifier in the message.
      Considerations from [RFC5213] MUST be applied for extending the
      lifetime of a mobile node's session.  It MUST also send a Proxy
      Binding Acknowledgment message with the Status field value set to
      0 (Proxy Binding Update accepted).  The lifetime field in the
      message MUST be set to the allocated lifetime for all the mobility
      sessions.  The message MUST also include the Mobile Node Group
      Identifier option, with the identifier value copied from the
      Mobile Node Group Identifier option present in the received Proxy
      Binding Update message.

   o  If the local mobility anchor rejects the bulk binding update
      request for any administrative reason, then it MUST NOT update the
      lifetime in the binding cache entries of any of the mobile nodes
      identified by the group identifier.  The local mobility anchor
      SHOULD send a Proxy Binding Acknowledgment indicating the reason
      for the rejection in the status code.

   o  Any time the local mobility anchor receives a Binding Revocation
      Indication Message [RFC5846], with a Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option present in the request and with sub-type value of (1) (bulk
      binding update group), the local mobility anchor MUST consider the
      request as a bulk revocation request, with the request scope for
      revoking of all the mobility sessions that share the same group

      identifier present in the Mobile Node Group Identifier option.
      However, if the received request also includes a Mobile Node
      Identifier option [RFC5213], Home Network Prefix option [RFC5213],
      the IPv4 Home Address Request option [RFC5844], or the GRE Key
      Option [RFC5845], the local mobility anchor MUST consider this as
      an invalid message; it MUST reject the Binding Revocation
      Indication message and send a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement
      message with the Status field set to a value of 128 (Binding Does
      NOT Exist).  All the considerations from [RFC5846] apply when
      processing binding revocation request, except making the scope of
      the operation apply to a set of mobility sessions identified by
      the group identifier present in the request.

   o  Upon accepting the Binding Revocation Indication request and
      completing the operation, the local mobility anchor MUST send a
      Binding Revocation Acknowledgement message with the Status field
      set to a value of 0 (success).  The message MUST include the
      Mobile Node Group Identifier option, with the identifier value
      copied from the Mobile Node Group Identifier option present in the
      received Binding Revocation Indication message.


6.  Protocol Configuration Variables

6.1.  Local Mobility Anchor - Configuration Variables

   The local mobility anchor MUST allow the following variables to be
   configured by the system management.  The configured values for these
   protocol variables MUST survive server reboots and service restarts.

   AcceptBulkBindingUpdateReqMobilitySession

      This flag indicates whether or not the local mobility anchor
      should accept the request from the mobile access gateway to enable
      bulk binding update support for the mobility session.  The default
      value for this flag is set to (1), indicating that it SHOULD
      accept the request from the mobile access gateway.  If the value
      of the flag is set to (0), the local mobility anchor MUST deny the
      request.

6.2.  Mobile Access Gateway - Configuration Variables

   The mobile access gateway MUST allow the following variables to be
   configured by the system management.  The configured values for these
   protocol variables MUST survive server reboots and service restarts.

      This flag indicates whether or not the mobile access gateway
      should request the local mobility anchor to enable bulk binding
      update support for the mobility session.  The default value for
      this flag is set to (1), indicating that the the mobile access
      gateway MUST set the bulk binding update flag (B) in the Proxy
      Binding Update request to a value of (1).  If the flag is set to a
      value of (0), the mobile access gateway MUST set the bulk binding
      update flag (B) in the Proxy Binding Update to a value of (0).


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following five IANA actions.

   o  Action-1: This specification defines a new flag (B) to the Proxy
      Binding Update message, specified in [RFC5213].  This flag is
      described in Section 4.1.  The value of the flag (B) needs to be
      allocated from the Binding Update Flags registry.

   o  Action-2: This specification defines a new flag (B) to the Proxy
      Binding Acknowledgment message, specified in [RFC5213].  This flag
      is described in Section 4.2.  The value of the flag (B) needs to
      be allocated from the Binding Acknowledgment Flags registry.

   o  Action-3: This specification defines a new Mobility Header option,
      the Mobile Node Group Identifier option.  This option is described
      in Section 4.3.  The Type value for this option needs to be
      assigned from the same numbering space as allocated for the other
      mobility options [RFC6275].

   o  Action-4: The Sub-type field of the Mobile Node Group Identifier
      option introduces a new number space.  This number space needs to
      be managed by IANA, under the Registry, Mobile Node Group
      Identifier Type Registry.  This specification reserves the sub-
      type value of (1) (Bulk Binding Update Group).  Approval of new
      sub-type values are to be made through IANA Expert Review.

   o  Action-5: This document also defines a new status value
      INVALID_MOBILE_NODE_GROUP_IDENTIFIER (Invalid group identifier
      value in the request: IANA-5) for use in Proxy Binding
      Acknowledgement message, as described in Section 4.4.  This value
      is to be assigned from the same number space as allocated for
      other Status codes [RFC6275].  The allocated value has to be
      greater than 128.

8.  Security Considerations

   The Mobile Node Group Identifier option defined in this specification
   is for use in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   messages.  This option is carried like any other mobility header
   option and it does not require any other special security
   considerations.

   The bulk binding update and the bulk revocation operations specified
   in this document, perform operations on a group of mobility sessions.
   If proper authorization checks are not in place, a malicious node may
   be able to hijack a mobile node's mobility session or may carry out a
   denial- of-service attack.  To prevent this attack, this
   specification requires the local mobility anchor to allow only
   authorized mobile access gateways to perform bulk operations.
