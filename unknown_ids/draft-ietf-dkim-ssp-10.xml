      <t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a domain-level
        authentication framework for email to permit verification of the
        source and contents of messages. This document specifies an adjunct
        mechanism to aid in assessing messages that do not contain a DKIM
        signature for the domain used in the author's address. It defines a
        record that can advertise whether a domain signs its outgoing mail, and
        how other hosts can access that record. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a mechanism by which email
        messages can be cryptographically signed, permitting a signing domain
        to claim responsibility for the introduction of a message into the
        mail stream. Message recipients can verify the signature by querying
        the signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key,
        and thereby confirm that the message was attested to by a party in
        possession of the private key for the signing domain.</t>

      <t>However, the legacy of the Internet is such that not all messages
        will be signed, and the absence of a signature on a message is not an
        a priori indication of forgery. In fact, during early phases of
        deployment it is very likely that most messages will remain unsigned.
        However, some domains might decide to sign all of their outgoing mail,
        for example, to protect their brand names. It might be
	desirable for such
        domains to be able to advertise that fact to other hosts. This is the
        topic of Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP).</t>

      <t>Hosts implementing this specification can inquire what Author Domain
	Signing
        Practices a domain advertises. This inquiry is called an Author
        Domain Signing Practices check.</t>

      <t>The basic requirements for ADSP are given in <xref target="RFC5016"
         />. This document refers extensively to <xref target="RFC4871" /> and
        assumes the reader is familiar with it.</t>

        <t>Some terminology used herein is derived directly from <xref
            target="RFC4871" />. In several cases, references in that document
          to Sender have been changed to Author here, to emphasize the
          relationship to the Author address(es) in the From: header field
          described in <xref target="RFC5322" />. Briefly, <list

            <!--   
  Selectors have nothing to do with ADSP.
  
  <t>A "Selector" specifies which of the keys published by a signing
              domain is to be queried, as defined in section 3.1 of <xref
                target="RFC4871" />.</t>

            <t>A "Local-part" is the part of an address preceding the @ character,

                target="RFC4871" />.</t>
          </list></t>

      </section>
      <section title="Valid Signature">

        <t>A "Valid Signature" is any signature on a message which correctly
          verifies using the procedure described in section 6.1 of <xref
            target="RFC4871" />.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Author Address">

        <t>An "Author Address" is an email address in the From header field of
          a message <xref target="RFC5322" />. If the From header field
          contains multiple addresses, the message has multiple Author
          Addresses.</t>

      <section title="Author Domain">

        <t>An "Author Domain" is everything to the right of the "@" in an

      <!-- <section title="Alleged Signer">

	 <t>An "Alleged Signer" is the identity of the signer claimed in a DKIM-Signature

       </section> -->
      <section title="Alleged Author">

        <t>An "Alleged Author" is an Author Address of a message; it is

      </section>
      <section title="Author Domain Signing Practices">

        <t>"Author Domain Signing Practices" (or just "practices") consist of
          a machine-readable record published by the domain of an Alleged
          Author which includes statements about the domain's practices with
          respect to mail it sends with its domain in the From: line.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Author Domain Signature">

        <t>An "Author Domain Signature" is a Valid Signature in which
	  the domain name of the DKIM signing entity,
	  the d= tag in the DKIM-Signature header field,
	  is the same as the domain name in the Author Address.
	  Following <xref target="RFC5321" />, 
	  domain name comparisons are case insensitive.</t>

        <t>For example, if the From: line address is bob@domain.example,
	  and the message has a Valid Signature, with the
          DKIM-Signature header field containing <spanx style="verb"
            >d=domain.example</spanx>, then the message has an Author
	  Domain Signature.</t>

    <section title="Operation Overview">

      <t>Domain owners publish ADSP information via a query mechanism such
        as the Domain Name System; specific details are given in <xref
          target="dnsrep" />.</t>

      <t>Hosts can look up the ADSP information of the domain(s) specified by
        the Author Address(es) as described in <xref target="Lookup" />. If a
        message has multiple Author Addresses the ADSP lookups SHOULD be
        performed independently on each address. This document does not
        address the process a host might use to combine the lookup results. </t>
      <section anchor="applicability" title="ADSP Applicability">
        <t> ADSP as defined in this document is bound to DNS. For this reason,
          ADSP is applicable only to Author Domains with appropriate DNS
          records (see Note below). The handling of other Author Domains is
          outside the scope of this document. However, attackers may use such
          domain names in a deliberate attempt to sidestep an organization's
          ADSP policy statements. It is up to the ADSP checker implementation
          to return an appropriate error result for Author Domains outside the
          scope of ADSP.</t>
	<t>ADSP applies to specific domains, not domain subtrees.
	  If, for example, an Author Address were user@domain.example, the
	  Author Domain would be domain.example, and the applicable ADSP
	  record would be at _adsp._domainkey.domain.example.
	  An Author Address in a subdomain such as user@sub.domain.example
	  would have a different ADSP record at
	  _adsp._domainkey.sub.domain.example.
	  ADSP makes no connection between a domain and its parent or
	  child domains.
	  
	  <list style="hanging">
	    <t hangText="Note:  ">If an organization wants
	      to publish Author Domain Signing
	      Practices for all the subdomains it uses, such as host names
	      of servers within the domain,
	      it does so by creating ADSP
	      records for every _adsp._domainkey.&lt;sub&gt;.domain.example.
	      Wildcards cannot be used (see <xref target="wildcards" />.);
	      however, suitable DNS management tools
	      could automate creation of the ADSP records.</t>

            <t hangText="Note:  "> The results from DNS queries that are
              intended to validate a domain name unavoidably approximate
              the set of Author Domains that can appear in legitimate email.
              For example, a DNS A record could belong to a device that does
              not even have an email implementation. It is up to the checker
              to decide what degree of approximation is acceptable.</t>

      <section title="ADSP Usage" anchor="usage">

        <t>Depending on the Author Domain(s) and the signatures in a message,
          a recipient gets varying amounts of useful information from each
          ADSP lookup. <list style="symbols">

            <t>If a message has no Valid Signature, the ADSP result is
              directly relevant to the message.</t>

            <t>If a message has an Author Domain Signature, ADSP
              provides no benefit relative to that domain since the message is
              already known to be compliant with any possible ADSP for that
              domain.</t>

            <t>If a message has a Valid Signature other than an
              Author Domain Signature, the receiver can use both the Signature and the
              ADSP result in its evaluation of the message.</t>

              domain signature. This is the default if the domain exists in the DNS

            <t>All messages from this domain are signed with
	      an Author Domain Signature.</t>

            <t>All messages from this domain are signed with an Author
	      Domain Signature and
	      discardable, i.e., if a message
	      arrives without a valid Author Domain Signature,
	      the domain encourages the recipient(s) to discard it.</t>

            <t>This domain is out of scope, i.e., the domain does not

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <t>Security considerations in the ADSP are mostly related to attempts on
        the part of malicious senders to represent themselves as authors for
        whom they are not authorized to send mail, often in an attempt to
        defraud either the recipient or an Alleged Author.</t>

      <t>Additional security considerations regarding Author Domain Signing
        Practices are found in <xref target="RFC4686">the DKIM threat
        analysis</xref>.</t>
      <section title="ADSP Threat Model">

        <t>Email recipients often have a core set of content authors that they
          already trust. Common examples include financial institutions with
          which they have an existing relationship and Internet web
          transaction sites with which they conduct business.</t>

        <t>Email abuse often seeks to exploit  a legitimate email author's
	  name-recognition among recipients, by using the author's
          domain name in the From: header field. Especially since many popular
          MUAs do not display the author's email address, there is no
          empirical evidence of the extent that this particular unauthorized
          use of a domain name contributes to recipient deception or that
          eliminating it will have significant effect.</t>

        <t>However, closing this exploit could facilitate some types of
          optimized processing by receive-side message filtering engines,
          since it could permit them to maintain higher-confidence assertions
          about From: header field uses of a domain, when the occurrence is
          authorized.</t>

        <t>Unauthorized uses of domain names occur elsewhere in messages, as
          do unauthorized uses of organizations' names. These attacks are
          outside the scope of this specification.</t>

        <t>ADSP does not provide any benefit--nor, indeed, have any effect at
          all--unless an external system acts upon the verdict, either by
          treating the message differently during the delivery process or by
          showing some indicator to the end recipient. Such a system is out of
          scope for this specification.</t>

        <t>ADSP checkers may perform multiple DNS lookups per Alleged Author
          Domain. Since these lookups are driven by domain names in email
          message headers of possibly fraudulent email, legitimate ADSP
          checkers can become participants in traffic multiplication
          attacks on domains that appear in fraudulent email.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="DNS Considerations">

        <t>An attacker might attack the DNS infrastructure in an attempt to
          impersonate ADSP records to influence a receiver's
          decision on how it will handle mail. However, such an attacker is
          more likely to attack at a higher level, e.g., redirecting A or MX
          record lookups in order to capture traffic that was legitimately
          intended for the target domain. These DNS security issues are
          addressed by <xref target="RFC4033">DNSSEC</xref>.</t>

        <t>Because ADSP operates within the framework of the legacy e-mail
          system, the default result in the absence of an ADSP record is that
          the domain does not sign all of its messages. It is therefore
          important that the ADSP clients distinguish a DNS failure such as
            <spanx style="verb">SERVFAIL</spanx> from other DNS errors so that
          appropriate actions can be taken.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="wildcards" title="DNS Wildcards">

	<t>DNS wildcards (described in <xref target="RFC4592" />) that exist
	  in the DNS hierarchy at or above the domain being checked
	  interfere with the ability to verify the
	  scope of the ADSP check described in <xref target="Lookup" />.
	  For example, a
	  wildcard record for *.domain.example makes all subdomains
	  such as foo.domain.example exist in the DNS.
	  Domains that intend to make active use of ADSP by publishing
	  a practice other than Unknown are advised
	  to avoid the use of wildcards in their hierarchy.</t>

        <t>If a domain contains wildcards, then any name that matches
	  the wildcard can appear to be a valid mail domain eligible for ADSP.
	  But the <spanx style="verb">_adsp._domainkey.</spanx> prefix
	  on ADSP records does not allow publication of wildcard records that
	  cover ADSP records without also covering non-ADSP records,
	  nor publication
	  of wildcard records that cover non-ADSP records without
	  also covering ADSP records.
	  A domain that uses ADSP practices other than unknown
	  SHOULD NOT publish wildcard records.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Inappropriate Application of Author Domain Signatures">
	<t>
	  In one model of DKIM usage, a domain signs messages that are
	  in transit through their system.  Since any signature whose
	  domain matches the Author Domain is by definition an Author
	  Domain Signature, it would be unwise to sign mail whose
	  Author Domain is the signer's domain if the mail is not
	  known to meet the domain's standards for an Author Domain
	  Signature.</t>

	<t>One such use case is where a domain might apply such a
	  signature is following application of an
	  Authentication-Results header field as described in Section
	  7.1 of <xref target="RFC5451" />.
	  This problem can be easily avoided either
	  by not applying a signature that might be confused with an
	  Author Domain Signature or by applying a signature from some
	  other domain, such as a subdomain of the Author Domain.

    <section title="Usage Examples">
      <t>These examples are intended to illustrate typical uses of ADSP. They
        are not intended to be exhaustive, nor to apply to every domain's or
        mail system's individual situation.</t>

      <t>Domain managers are advised to consider the ways that mail processing
        can modify messages in ways that will invalidate an existing DKIM
        signature, such as mailing lists, courtesy forwarders, and other paths
        that could add or modify headers, or modify the message body. In that
        case, if the modifications invalidate the DKIM signature, recipient
        hosts will consider the mail not to have an Author Domain Signature, even
        though the signature was present when the mail was originally sent.</t>

      <section anchor="allexamp" title="Single Location Domains">
        <t>A common mail system configuration handles all of a domain's users'
          incoming and outgoing mail through a single MTA or group of MTAs. In
          that case, the MTA(s) can be configured to sign outgoing mail with
          an Author Domain Signature.</t>
        <t>In this situation it might be appropriate to publish an ADSP record
          for the domain containing "all", depending on whether the users also
          send mail through other paths that do not apply an Author Domain Signature.
          Such paths could include MTAs at hotels or hotspot networks used by
          travelling users, web sites that provide "mail an article"
	  features,
	  user messages sent through mailing lists,
	  or third party mail clients that
	  support multiple user identities.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Bulk Mailing Domains">
        <t>Another common configuration uses a domain solely for bulk or
          broadcast mail, with no individual human users, again typically
          sending all the mail through a single MTA or group of MTAs that can
          apply an Author Domain Signature. In this case, the domain's management can
          be confident that all of its outgoing mail will be sent through the
          signing MTA. Lacking individual users, the domain is unlikely to
          participate in mailing lists, but could still send mail through
          other paths that might invalidate signatures.</t>

        <t>Domain owners often use specialist mailing providers to send their
          bulk mail. In that case, the mailing provider needs access to a
          suitable signing key in order to apply an Author Domain Signature. One
          possible route would be for the domain owner to generate the key and
          give it to the mailing provider. Another would be for the domain to
          delegate a subdomain to the mailing provider, for example,
          bigbank.example might delegate email.bigbank.example to such a
          provider. In that case, the provider can generate the keys and DKIM
          DNS records itself and use the subdomain in the Author address in
          the mail.</t>

	<t>Regardless of the DNS and key management strategy chosen, whoever
	  maintains the DKIM records for the domain could also install an
	  ADSP record containing "all".</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Bulk Mailing Domains with Discardable Mail">
        <t>In some cases, a domain might sign all of its outgoing mail with an
          Author Domain Signature, but prefer that recipient systems discard mail
          without a valid Author Domain Signature to avoid confusion from mail sent
          from sources that do not apply an Author Domain Signature.
	  (In the case of domains with tightly controlled outgoing mail,
	  this latter
          kind of mail is sometimes loosely called "forgeries".) In that case,
          it might be appropriate to publish an ADSP record containing
          "discardable". Note that a domain SHOULD NOT publish a "discardable"
          record if it wishes to maximize the likelihood that mail from the
          domain is delivered, since it could cause some fraction of the mail
          the domain sends to be discarded.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Third Party Senders">

        <t>Another common use case is for a third party to enter into an
          agreement whereby that third party will send bulk or other mail on
          behalf of a designated author or author domain, using that domain in
          the RFC5322 From: or other headers. Due to the many and varied
          complexities of such agreements, third party signing is not
          addressed in this specification.
          <!-- The
	   authors anticipate that as mail systems gain experience
	   with DKIM, it will become possible to codify best practices
	   of this and other usages of DKIM. --></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Domains with Independent Users and Liberal Use Policies">
	
	<t>When a domain has independent users and its usage policy
	  does not explicitly restrict them to sending mail only from
	  designated mail servers (e.g. many ISP domains and even some
	  corporate domains), then it is only appropriate to publish
	  an ADSP record containing "unknown". Publishing either "all"
	  or "discardable" will likely result in significant breakage
	  because independent users are likely to send mail from the
	  external paths enumerated in <xref target="allexamp" />.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Non-email Domains">
        <t>If a domain sends no mail at all, it can safely
          publish a "discardable" ADSP record, since any mail with an author
          address in the domain is a forgery.</t>

            <t>Reworded introduction for clarity.</t>

            <t>Various definition clarifications.</t>

            <t>Changed names of practices to unknown, all, and discardable.</t>

            <t>Removed normative language mandating use of SSP in particular
              situations (issue 1538).</t>

            <t>Clarified possible confusion over handling of syntax errors.</t>

            <t>Removed normative language from Introduction (issue 1538).</t>

            <t>Changed "Originator" to "Author" throughout (issue 1529).</t>

            <t>Removed all references to Third-Party Signatures (issues 1512,
              1521).</t>

            <t>Removed all mention of "Suspicious" (issues 1528, 1530).</t>

            <t>Removed "t=y" (testing) flag (issue 1540).</t>

            <t>Removed "handling" tag (issue 1513).</t>

            <t>Broke up the "Sender Signing Practices Check Procedure" into
              two algorithms: fetching the SSP record and interpretation
              thereof (issues 1531, 1535; partially addresses issue 1520).
              Interpretation is now the responsibility of the Evaluator.</t>

            <t>Document restructuring for better flow and remove redundancies
              (some may address issue 1523, but I'm not sure I understand that
              issue completely; also issues 1532, 1537).</t>

            <t>Removed all mention of how this interacts with users, even
              though it makes parts of the document harder to understand
              (issue 1526).</t>

            <t>Introduced the concepts of "SSP Checker" and "Evaluator".</t>

            <t>Multiple author case now handled my separate invocations of SSP
              checker by Evaluator (issue 1525).</t>

            <t>Removed check to avoid querying top-level domains.</t>

            <t>Changed ABNF use of whitespace from [FWS] to *WSP (partially
              addresses issue 1543).</t>

            <t>Clarified Operation Overview and eliminated use of Legitimate
              as the counterpart of Suspicious since the words have different
              meanings.</t>

            <t>Improved discussion (courtesy of Arvel Hathcock) of the use of
              TXT records in DNS vs. a new RR type.</t>

            <t>Clarified publication rules for multilevel names.</t>

            <t>Better description of overall record syntax, in particular that
              records with unknown tags are considered syntactically correct.</t>

            <t>Clarified Sender Signing Practices Check Procedure, primarily
              by use of new term Author Domain.</t>

            <t>Eliminated section "Third-Party Signatures and Mailing Lists"
              that is better included in the DKIM overview document.</t>

            <t>Added "handling" tag to express alleged sending domain's
              preference about handling of Suspicious messages.</t>

            <t>Clarified handling of SERVFAIL error in SSP check.</t>

            <t>Replaced "entity" with "domain", since with the removal of
              user-granularity SSP, the only entities having sender signing
              policies are domains.</t>
