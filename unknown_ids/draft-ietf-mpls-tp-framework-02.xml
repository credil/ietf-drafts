        <!--Updated in line with the requirements draft intro-->

        <t>This document describes a framework for a Multiprotocol Label
        Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). It presents the architectural
        framework for MPLS-TP, defining those elements of MPLS applicable to
        supporting the requirements in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-requirements" /> and what new protocol
        elements are required.</t>

        <t>Bandwidth demand continues to grow worldwide, stimulated by the
        accelerating growth and penetration of new packet based services and
        multimedia applications:</t>

        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Packet-based services such as Ethernet, Voice over IP (VoIP),
            Layer 2 (L2)/Layer 3 (L3) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), IP
            Television (IPTV), Radio Access Network (RAN) back-hauling,
            etc.,</t>

            <t>Applications with various bandwidth and Quality of Service
            (QoS) requirements.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>This growth in demand has resulted in dramatic increases in access
        rates that are, in turn, driving dramatic increases in metro and core
        network bandwidth requirements.</t>

        <t>Over the past two decades, the evolving optical transport
        infrastructure (Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET)/Synchronous
        Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Optical Transport Network (OTN)) has provided
        carriers with a high benchmark for reliability and operational
        simplicity. To achieve this, these existing transport technologies
        have been designed with specific characteristics :</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Strictly connection-oriented connectivity, which may be
            long-lived and may be provisioned manually or by network
            management.</t>

            <t>A high level of protection and availability.</t>

            <t>Quality of service.</t>

            <t>Extended OAM capabilities.</t>
          </list>Carriers are looking to evolve such transport networks to
        support packet based services and networks, and to take advantage of
        the flexibility and cost benefits of packet switching technology.
        While MPLS is a maturing packet technology that is already playing an
        important role in transport networks and services, not all of MPLS's
        capabilities and mechanisms are needed and/or consistent with
        transport network operations. There are also transport technology
        characteristics that are not currently reflected in MPLS.</t>

        <t>The types of packet transport services delivered by transport
        networks are very similar to Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks defined
        by the IETF.</t>

        <t>There are thus two objectives for MPLS-TP:</t>

        <t>
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>To enable MPLS to be deployed in a transport network and
            operated in a similar manner to existing transport
            technologies.</t>

            <t>To enable MPLS to support packet transport services with a
            similar degree of predictability to that found in existing
            transport networks.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>In order to achieve these objectives, there is a need to create a
        common set of new functions that are applicable to both MPLS networks
        in general, and those belonging to the MPLS-TP profile.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP therefore defines a profile of MPLS targeted at transport
        applications and networks. This profile specifies the specific MPLS
        characteristics and extensions required to meet transport
        requirements. An equipment conforming to MPLS-TP MUST support this
        profile. An MPLS-TP conformant equipment MAY support additional MPLS
        features. A carrier may deploy some of those additional features in
        the transport layer of their network if they find them to be
        beneficial.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t><xref target="tp-spectrum" /> illustrates the range of services
        that MPLS-TP is intended to address. MPLS-TP is intended to support a
        range of layer 1, layer 2 and layer 3 services, and is not limited to
        layer 3 services only. Networks implementing MPLS-TP may choose to
        only support a subset of these services.</t>

        <t>The diagram above shows the spectrum of services that can be
        supported by MPLS. MPLS-TP solutions are primarily intended for packet
        transport applications. These can be deployed using a profile of MPLS
        that is strictly connection oriented and does not rely on IP
        forwarding or routing (shown on the right hand side of the figure), or
        in conjunction with an MPLS network that does use IP forwarding and
        that supports a broader range of IP services. This is the
        multi-service solution in the centre of the figure.<!--move this section after terminology--></t>

This document describes the architecture for MPLS-TP when the LSP client is a PW. The transport of IP and MPLS, other than carried over a PW, is outside the scope of 
this document. This does not preclude the use of LSPs conforming to the MPLS transport profile from being used to carry IP or other MPLS LSPs by general purpose MPLS 
networks.

      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-requirements" />.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Introduction to Requirements">
      <t>The requirements for MPLS-TP are specified in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-requirements"></xref>, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements"></xref>, and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-req"></xref>. This section provides a brief
      reminder to guide the reader. It is not intended as a substitute for
      these documents.</t>

      <t>MPLS-TP MUST NOT modify the MPLS forwarding architecture and MUST be
      based on existing pseudowire and LSP constructs. Any new mechanisms and
      capabilities added to support transport networks and packet transport
      services must be able to inter-operate with existing MPLS and pseudowire
      control and forwarding planes.</t>

      <t>Point to point LSPs MAY be unidirectional or bi-directional, and it
      MUST be possible to construct congruent Bi-directional LSPs. Point to
      multipoint LSPs are unidirectional.</t>

      <t>MPLS-TP LSPs do not merge with other LSPs at an MPLS-TP LSR and it
      MUST be possible to detect if a merged LSP has been created.</t>

      <t>It MUST be possible to forward packets solely based on switching the
      MPLS or PW label. It MUST also be possible to establish and maintain
      LSPs and/or pseudowires both in the absence or presence of a dynamic
      control plane. When static provisioning is used, there MUST be no
      dependency on dynamic routing or signaling.</t>

      <t>OAM, protection and forwarding of data packets MUST be able to
      operate without IP forwarding support.</t>

      <t>It MUST be possible to monitor LSPs and pseudowires through the use
      of OAM in the absence of control plane or routing functions. In this
      case information gained from the OAM functions is used to initiate path
      recovery actions at either the PW or LSP layers.</t>

    <section title="Transport Profile Overview ">
      <t></t>

      <section title="Packet Transport Services">
        <t>One objective of MPLS-TP is to enable MPLS networks to provide
        packet transport services with a similar degree of predictability to
        that found in existing transport networks. Such packet transport
        services inherit a number of characteristics, defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-requirements"></xref>.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>In an environment where an MPLS-TP layer network is supporting
            a client layer network, and the MPLS-TP layer network is supported
            by a server layer network then operation of the MPLS-TP layer
            network MUST be possible without any dependencies on the server or
            client layer network.</t>

            <t>The service provided by the MPLS-TP network to the client is
            guaranteed not to fall below the agreed level regardless of other
            client activity.</t>

            <t>The control and management planes of any client network layer
            that uses the service is isolated from the control and management
            planes of the MPLS-TP layer network.</t>

            <t>Where a client network makes use of an MPLS-TP server that
            provides a packet transport service, the level of co-ordination
            required between the client and server layer networks is minimal
            (preferably no co-ordination will be required).</t>

            <t>The complete set of packets generated by a client MPLS(-TP)
            layer network using the packet transport service, which may
            contain packets that are not MPLS packets (e.g. IP or CNLS packets
            used by the control/management plane of the client MPLS(-TP) layer
            network), are transported by the MPLS-TP server layer network.</t>

            <t>The packet transport service enables the MPLS-TP layer network
            addressing and other information (e.g. topology) to be hidden from
            any client layer networks using that service, and vice-versa.</t>

        <t>The above figures illustrates the MPLS-TP architecture used to
        provide a point-to-point packet transport service, or VPWS. In this
        case, the MPLS-TP forwarding plane is a profile of the MPLS LSP and
        SS-PW or MS-PW forwarding architecture as detailed in section <xref
        target="FWD"></xref>.</t>

        <t>This document describes the architecture for MPLS-TP when the LSP
        client is a PW. The transport of IP and MPLS, other than carried over
        a PW, is outside the scope of this document. This does not preclude
        the use of LSPs conforming to the MPLS transport profile from being
        used to carry IP or other MPLS LSPs by general purpose MPLS networks.
        LSP hierarchy MAY be used within the MPLS-TP network, so that more
        than one LSP label MAY appear in the label stack.</t>

        <t><xref target="MPLS-TP-Defn">Figure</xref> illustrates the protocol
        stack to be used when pseudowires are carried over MPLS-TP LSPs.</t>

        <t>When providing a VPWS, VPLS, VPMS or IPLS, pseudowires MUST be used
        to carry a client service. For compatibility with transport
        nomenclature, the PW may be referred to as the MPLS-TP Channel and the
        LSP may be referred to as the MPLS-TP Path.</t>

        <t>Note that in MPLS-TP environments where IP is used for control or
        OAM purposes, IP MAY be carried over the LSP demultiplexers as per
        RFC3031 <xref target="RFC3031"></xref>, or directly over the
        server.</t>

        <t>PW OAM, PSN OAM and PW client data are mutually exclusive and never
        exist in the same packet.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP definition applies to the following two domains:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>MPLS-TP Forwarding Domain</t>

            <t>MPLS-TP Transport Domain</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="FWD" title="MPLS-TP Forwarding Domain" toc="default">
        <t>A set of client-to-MPLS-TP adaptation functions interface the
        client to MPLS-TP. For pseudowires, this adaptation function is the PW
        forwarder shown in Figure 4a of <xref target="RFC3985"></xref>. The PW
        label is used for forwarding in this case and is always at the bottom
        of the label stack. The operation of the MPLS-TP network is
        independent of the payload carried by the MPLS-TP PW packet.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP is itself a client of an underlying server layer. MPLS-TP
        is thus bounded by a set of adaptation functions to this server layer
        network. These adaptation functions provide encapsulation of the
        MPLS-TP frames and for the transparent transport of those frames over
        the server layer network. The MPLS-TP client inherits its QoS from the
        MPLS-TP network, which in turn inherits its QoS from the server layer.
        The server layer must therefore provide the necessary Quality of
        Service (QoS) to ensure that the MPLS-TP client QoS commitments are
        satisfied.</t>

        <!--Added reference to RFC5332 as per Rahul's comment-->

        <t>MPLS-TP LSPs use the MPLS label switching operations defined in
        <xref target="RFC3031"></xref> for point-to-point LSPs and <xref
        target="RFC5332"></xref> for point to multipoint LSPs. These
        operations are highly optimized for performance and are not modified
        by the MPLS-TP profile.</t>

        <t>During forwarding a label is pushed to associate a forwarding
        equivalence class (FEC) with the LSP or PW. This specifies the
        processing operation to be performed by the next hop at that level of
        encapsulation. A swap of this label is an atomic operation in which
        the contents of the packet after the swapped label are opaque to the
        forwarder. The only event that interrupts a swap operation is TTL
        expiry, in which case the packet may be inspected and either discarded
        or subjected to further processing within the LSR. TTL expiry causes
        an exception which forces a packet to be further inspected and
        processed. While this occurs, the forwarding of succeeding packets
        continues without interruption. Therefore, the only way to cause a P
        (intermediate) LSR to inspect a packet (for example for OAM purposes)
        is to set the TTL to expire at that LSR.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP PWs support the PW and MS-PW forwarding operations defined
        in<xref target="RFC3985"></xref> and <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The Traffic Class field (formerly the MPLS EXP field) follows the
        definition and processing rules of <xref target="RFC5462"></xref> and
        <xref target="RFC3270"></xref>. Only the pipe and short-pipe models
        are supported in MPLS-TP.</t>

        <t>The MPLS encapsulation format is as defined in RFC 3032<xref
        target="RFC3032"></xref>. Per-platform label space is used for PWs.
        Either per-platform or per-interface label space may be used for
        LSPs.</t>

        <t>Point to point MPLS-TP LSPs can be either unidirectional or
        bidirectional. Point-to-multipoint MPLS-TP LSPs are unidirectional.
        Point-to-multipont PWs are currently being defined in the IETF and may
        be incorporated in MPLS-TP if required.</t>

        <t>It MUST be possible to configure an MPLS-TP LSP such that the
        forward and backward directions of a bidirectional MPLS-TP LSP are
        co-routed i.e. they follow the same path. The pairing relationship
        between the forward and the backward directions must be known at each
        LSR or LER on a bidirectional LSP.</t>

        <t>Per-packet equal cost multi-path (ECMP) load balancing is not
        applicable to MPLS-TP LSPs.</t>

        <t>Penultimate hop popping (PHP) is disabled on MPLS-TP LSPs by
        default.</t>

        <t>Both E-LSP and L-LSP are supported in MPLS-TP, as defined in RFC
        3270 <xref target="RFC3270"></xref></t>

            <t>A network layer transport service</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>When the client is a PW, the MPLS-TP transport domain consists of
        the PW encapsulation mechanisms, including the PW control word. When
        the client is operating at the network layer the mechanism described
        in <xref target="NLTS-sec"></xref> is used.</t>

        <section anchor="NLTS-sec" title="Network Layer Transport Service">
          <t>MPLS-TP LSPs can be used to deliver a network level transport
          service. Such a network layer transport service (NLTS) can be used
          to transport any network layer protocol between service interfaces.
          Example of network layer protocols include IP, MPLS and even
          MPLS-TP.</t>

          <t>With network layer transport, the MPLS-TP domain provides a
          bidirectional point-to-point connection between two customer edge
          (CE) MPLS-TP nodes. Point-to- multipoint service is for further
          study. As shown in <xref target="NLTS"></xref>, there is an
          attachment circuit between the CE node on the left and its
          corresponding provider edge (PE) node that provides the service
          interface, a bidirectional LSP across the MPLS-TP service network to
          the corresponding PE node on the right, and an attachment circuit
          between that PE node and the corresponding CE node for this
          service.</t>

          <t>At the service interface the PE transforms the ingress packet to
          the format that will be carry over the transport network, and
          similarly the corresponding service interface at the egress PE
          transforms the packet to the format needed by the attached CE. The
          attachment circuits may be heterogeneous (e.g., any combination of
          SDH, PPP, frame relay etc) and network layer protocol payloads
          arrive at the service interface encapsulated in the L1/L2 encoding
          defined for that access link type. It should be noted that the set
          of network layer protocols includes MPLS and hence MPLS encoded
          packets with an MPLS label stack (the client MPLS stack), may appear
          at the service interface. </t>

          <t>Within the MPLS-TP transport network, the network layer protocols
          are carried over the MPLS-TP LSP using a separate MPLS label stack
          (the server stack). The server stack is entirely under the control
          of the nodes within the MPLS-TP transport network and it is not
          visible outside that network. In accordance with <xref
          target="RFC3032"></xref>, the bottom label, with the 'bottom of
          stack' bit set to '1', defines the network layer protocol being
          transported. <xref target="NLTS-stack"></xref> shows how an a client
          network protocol stack (which may be an MPLS label stack and

          <t>A label per network layer protocol payload type that is to be
          transported is REQUIRED. Such labels are referred to as "Service
          Labels", one of which is shown in <xref target="NLTS-stack"></xref>.
          The mapping between protocol payload type and Service Label is
          either configured or signaled.</t>

          <t>Service labels are typically carried over an MPLS-TP edge-to-edge
          LSP, which is also shown in <xref target="NLTS-stack"></xref>. The
          use of an edge-to-edge LSP is RECOMMENDED when more than one
          protocol payload type is to be transported. For example, if only
          MPLS is carried then a single Service Label would be used to
          provided both payload type indication and the MPLS-TP edge-to-edge
          LSP. Alternatively, if both IP and MPLS is to be carried then two
          Service Labels would be mapped on to a common MPLS-TP edge-to-edge
          LSP. </t>

          <t>As noted above, any layer 2 and layer 1 protocols used to carry
          the network layer protocol over the attachment circuit is terminated
          at the service interface and is not transported across the MPLS-TP
          network. This enables the use of different L2/L1 technologies at two
          service interfaces.</t>

          <t>At each service interface, Layer 2 addressing must be used to
          ensure the proper delivery of a network layer packet to the adjacent
          node. This is typically only an issue for LAN media technologies
          (e.g., Ethernet) which have Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. In
          cases where a MAC address is needed, the sending node MUST set the
          destination MAC address to an address that ensures delivery to the
          adjacent node. That is the CE sets the destination MAC address to an
          address that ensures delivery to the PE, and the PE sets the
          destination MAC address to an address that ensures delivery to the
          CE. The specific address used is technology type specific and is not
          covered in this document. (Examples for the Ethernet case include a
          configured unicast MAC address for the adjacent node, or even using
          the broadcast MAC address when the CE-PE service interface is
          dedicated. The configured address is then used as the MAC
          destination address for all packets sent over the service
          interface.)</t>

          <t>Note that when the two CEs operating over the network layer
          transport service are running a routing protocol such as ISIS or
          OSPF some care should be taken to configure the routing protocols to
          use point- to-point adjacencies. The specifics of such configuration
          is outside the scope of this document.</t>

          <t>[Editors Note we need to confer with ISIS and OSPF WG to verify
          that the cautionary note above is necessary and sufficient.] </t>

          <t>The CE to CE service types and corresponding labels may be
          configured or signaled. When they are signaled the CE to PE control
          channel may be either out-of-band or in-band. An out-of-band control
          channel uses standard GMPLS out-of-band signaling techniques
          [REF-TBD]. There are a number of methods that can be used to carry
          this signalling:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">

      <section anchor="addr" title="Identifiers">
        <t>Identifiers to be used in within MPLS-TP where compatibility with
        existing MPLS control plane conventions are necessary are described in
        [draft-swallow-mpls-tp-identifiers-00]. The MPLS-TP requirements <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-requirements"></xref> require that the
        elements and objects in an MPLS-TP environment are able to be
        configured and managed without a control plane. In such an environment
        many conventions for defining identifiers are possible. However it is
        also anticipated that operational environments where MPLS-TP objects,
        LSPs and PWs will be signaled via existing protocols such as the Label
        Distribution Protocol <xref target="RFC4447"></xref> and the Resource
        Reservation Protocol as it is applied to Generalized Multi-protocol
        Label Switching ( <xref target="RFC3471"></xref> and <xref
        target="RFC3473"></xref>) (GMPLS).
        [draft-swallow-mpls-tp-identifiers-00] defines a set of identifiers
        for MPLS-TP which are both compatible with those protocols and
        applicable to MPLS-TP management and OAM functions.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP distinguishes between addressing used to identify nodes in
        the network, and identifiers used for demultiplexing and
        forwarding.</t>

        <t>Whilst IP addressing is used by default, MPLS-TP must be able to
        operate in environments where IP is not used in the forwarding plane.
        Therefore, the default mechanism for OAM demultiplexing in MPLS-TP
        LSPs and PWs is the generic associated channel. Forwarding based on IP
        addresses for user or OAM packets is not REQUIRED for MPLS-TP.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC4379"></xref>and BFD for MPLS LSPs <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-bfd-mpls"></xref> have defined alert mechanisms that
        enable an MPLS LSR to identify and process MPLS OAM packets when the
        OAM packets are encapsulated in an IP header. These alert mechanisms
        are based on TTL expiration and/or use an IP destination address in
        the range 127/8. These mechanisms are the default mechanisms for MPLS
        networks in general for identifying MPLS OAM packets when the OAM
        packets are encapsulated in an IP header. MPLS-TP is unable to rely on
        the availability of IP and thus uses the GACH/GAL to demultiplex OAM
        packets.</t>

      <section anchor="OAM"
               title="Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)">
        <t>MPLS-TP supports a comprehensive set of OAM capabilities for packet
        transport applications, with equivalent capabilities to those provided
        in SONET/SDH.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP defines mechanisms to differentiate specific packets (e.g.
        OAM, APS, MCC or SCC) from those carrying user data packets on the
        same LSP. These mechanisms are described in <xref
        target="RFC5586"></xref>.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP requires <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements"></xref> that a set of OAM
        capabilities is available to perform fault management (e.g. fault
        detection and localization) and performance monitoring (e.g. packet
        delay and loss measurement) of the LSP, PW or section. The framework
        for OAM in MPLS-TP is specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework"></xref>.</t>

        <t>OAM and monitoring in MPLS-TP is based on the concept of
        maintenance entities, as described in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework"></xref>. A Maintenance Entity
        can be viewed as the association of two (or more) Maintenance End
        Points (MEPs) (see example in <xref target="tp-oam-ex"></xref> ). The
        MEPs that form an ME should be configured and managed to limit the OAM
        responsibilities of an OAM flow within a network or sub- network, or a
        transport path or segment, in the specific layer network that is being
        monitored and managed.</t>

        <!--The above sentence does not parse. Need to check with Italo.-->

        <t>Each OAM flow is associated with a single ME. Each MEP within an ME
        resides at the boundaries of that ME. An ME may also include a set of
        zero or more Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIPs), which reside
        within the Maintenance Entity. Maintenance end points (MEPs) are
        capable of sourcing and sinking OAM flows, while maintenance
        intermediate points (MIPs) can only sink or respond to OAM flows.</t>

        <t>The following MPLS-TP MEs are specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework"></xref>:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A Section Maintenance Entity (SME), allowing monitoring and
            management of MPLS-TP Sections (between MPLS LSRs).</t>

            <t>A LSP Maintenance Entity (LME), allowing monitoring and
            management of an end-to-end LSP (between LERs).</t>

            <t>A PW Maintenance Entity (PME), allowing monitoring and
            management of an end-to-end SS/MS-PWs (between T-PEs).</t>

            <t>An LSP Tandem Connection Maintenance Entity (LTCME), allowing
            estimation of OAM fault and performance metrics of a single LSP
            segment or of an aggregate of LSP segments. It also enables any
            OAM function applied to segment(s) of an LSP to be independent of
            the OAM function(s) operated on the end-to-end LSP. This can be
            achieved by including a label representing the LTCME on one or
            more LSP label stacks for 1:1 or N:1 monitoring of LSPs,
            respectively. Note that the term Tandem Connection Monitoring has
            historical significance dating back to the early days of the
            telephone network, but is equally applicable to the hierarchal
            architectures commonly employed in todays packet networks.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Individual MIPs along the path of an LSP or PW are addressed by
        setting the appropriate TTL in the label for the OAM packet, as per
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw"></xref>. Note that this
        works when the location of MIPs along the LSP or PW path is known by
        the MEP. There may be cases where this is not the case in general MPLS
        networks e.g. following restoration using a facility bypass LSP. In
        these cases, tools to trace the path of the LSP may be used to
        determine the appropriate setting for the TTL to reach a specific
        MIP.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP OAM packets share the same fate as their corresponding data
        packets, and are identified through the Generic Associated Channel
        mechanism <xref target="RFC5586"></xref>. This uses a combination of
        an Associated Channel Header (ACH) and a Generic Alert Label (GAL) to
        create a control channel associated to an LSP, Section or PW.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP OAM architecture support a wide range of OAM functions,
        including the following <list style="symbols">
            <t>Continuity Check</t>

            <t>Connectivity Verification</t>

            <t>Performance monitoring (e.g. loss and delay)</t>

            <t>Alarm suppression</t>

            <t>Remote Integrity</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>These are applicable to any layer defined within MPLS-TP, i.e. MPLS
        Section, LSP and PW.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP OAM toolset needs to be able to operate without relying
        on a dynamic control plane or IP functionality in the datapath. In the
        case of MPLS-TP deployment with IP functionality, all existing IP-MPLS
        OAM functions, e.g. LSP-Ping, BFD and VCCV, may be used. This does not
        preclude the use of other OAM tools in an IP addressable network.</t>

        <t>One use of OAM mechanisms is to detect link failures, node failures
        and performance outside the required specification which then may be
        used to trigger recovery actions, according to the requirements of the
        service.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="GENERICACH" title="Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh)">
        <t>For correct operation of the OAM it is important that the OAM
        packets fate share with the data packets. In addition in MPSL-TP it is
        necessary to discriminate between user data payloads and other types
        of payload. For example the packet may contain a Signaling
        Communication Channel (SCC), or a channel used for Automatic
        Protection Switching (APS) data. Such packets are carried on a control
        channel associated to the LSP, Section or PW. This is achieved by
        carrying such packets on a generic control channel associated to the
        LSP, PW or section.</t>

        <t>MPLS-TP makes use of such a generic associated channel (G-ACh) to
        support Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security
        (FCAPS) functions by carrying packets related to OAM, APS, SCC, MCC or
        other packet types in band over LSPs or PWs. The G-ACH is defined in
        <xref target="RFC5586"></xref> and it is similar to the Pseudowire
        Associated Channel <xref target="RFC4385"></xref>, which is used to
        carry OAM packets across pseudowires. The G-ACH is indicated by a
        generic associated channel header (ACH), similar to the Pseudowire
        VCCV control word, and this is present for all Sections, LSPs and PWs
        making use of FCAPS functions supported by the G-ACH.</t>

        <t>For pseudowires, the G-ACh use the first nibble of the pseudowire
        control word to provide the initial discrimination between data
        packets a packets belonging to the associated channel, as described
        in<xref target="RFC4385"></xref>. When the first nibble of a packet,
        immediately following the label at the bottom of stack, has a value of
        one, then this packet belongs to a G-ACh. The first 32 bits following
        the bottom of stack label then have a defined format called an
        associated channel header (ACH), which further defines the content of
        the packet. The ACH is therefore both a demultiplexer for G-ACh
        traffic on the PW, and a discriminator for the type of G-ACh
        traffic.</t>

        <t>When the OAM, or a similar message is carried over an LSP, rather
        than over a pseudowire, it is necessary to provide an indication in
        the packet that the payload is something other than a user data
        packet. This is achieved by including a reserved label with a value of
        13 in the label stack. This reserved label is referred to as the
        'Generic Alert Label (GAL)', and is defined in <xref
        target="RFC5586"></xref>. When a GAL is found anywhere within the
        label stack it indicates that the payload begins with an ACH. The GAL
        is thus a demultiplexer for G-ACh traffic on the LSP, and the ACH is a
        discriminator for the type of traffic carried on the G-ACh. Note
        however that MPLS-TP forwarding follows the normal MPLS model, and
        that a GAL is invisible to an LSR unless it is the top label in the
        label stack. The only other circumstance under which the label stack
        may be inspected for a GAL is when the TTL has expired. Any MPLS-TP
        component that intentionally performs this inspection must assume that
        it is asynchronous with respect to the forwarding of other packets.
        All operations on the label stack are in accordance with <xref
        target="RFC3031"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3032"></xref>.</t>

        <t>In MPLS-TP, the 'Generic Alert Label (GAL)' always appears at the
        bottom of the label stack (i.e. S bit set to 1), however this does not
        preclude its use elsewhere in the label stack in other
        applications.</t>

        <t>The G-ACH MUST only be used for channels that are an adjunct to the
        data service. Examples of these are OAM, APS, MCC and SCC, but the use
        is not restricted to those names services. The G-ACH MUST NOT be used
        to carry additional data for use in the forwarding path, i.e. it MUST
        NOT be used as an alternative to a PW control word, or to define a PW
        type.</t>

        <t>Since the G-ACh traffic is indistinguishable from the user data
        traffic at the server layer, bandwidth and QoS commitments apply to
        the gross traffic on the LSP, PW or section. Protocols using the G-ACh
        must therefore take into consideration the impact they have on the
        user data that they are sharing resources with. In addition, protocols
        using the G-ACh MUST conform to the security and congestion
        considerations described in <xref target="RFC5586"></xref>. .</t>

        <t><xref target="PWE3-stack"></xref> shows the reference model
        depicting how the control channel is associated with the pseudowire
        protocol stack. This is based on the reference model for VCCV shown in

        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane is based on a combination of the
        LDP-based control plane for pseudowires <xref target="RFC4447"></xref>
        and the RSVP-TE based control plane for MPLS-TP LSPs <xref
        target="RFC3471"></xref>. Some of the RSVP-TE functions that are
        required for LSP signaling for MPLS-TP are based on GMPLS.</t>

        <t>The distributed MPLS-TP control plane provides the following
        functions:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Signaling</t>

            <t>Routing</t>

            <t>Traffic engineering and constraint-based path computation</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In a multi-domain environment, the MPLS-TP control plane supports
        different types of interfaces at domain boundaries or within the
        domains. These include the User-Network Interface (UNI), Internal
        Network Node Interface (I-NNI), and External Network Node Interface
        (E-NNI). Note that different policies may be defined that control the
        information exchanged across these interface types.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane is capable of activating MPLS-TP OAM
        functions as described in the OAM section of this document <xref
        target="OAM"></xref> e.g. for fault detection and localization in the
        event of a failure in order to efficiently restore failed transport
        paths.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane supports all MPLS-TP data plane
        connectivity patterns that are needed for establishing transport paths
        including protected paths as described in the survivability section
        <xref target="SURVIVE"></xref> of this document. Examples of the
        MPLS-TP data plane connectivity patterns are LSPs utilizing the fast
        reroute backup methods as defined in <xref target="RFC4090"></xref>
        and ingress-to-egress 1+1 or 1:1 protected LSPs.</t>

        <t>The MPLS-TP control plane provides functions to ensure its own
        survivability and to enable it to recover gracefully from failures and
        degradations. These include graceful restart and hot redundant
        configurations. Depending on how the control plane is transported,
        varying degrees of decoupling between the control plane and data plane
        may be achieved.</t>

          target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch"></xref> ). The setup and
          maintenance of single-segment or multi- segment pseudowires uses the
          Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) as per <xref

          (GMPLS) protocol suite supporting packet-switched capable (PSC)

      <section anchor="SURVIVE" title="Survivability">
        <t>Survivability requirements for MPLS-TP are specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk"></xref>.</t>

        <t>A wide variety of resiliency schemes have been developed to meet
        the various network and service survivability objectives. For example,
        as part of the MPLS/PW paradigms, MPLS provides methods for local
        repair using back-up LSP tunnels (<xref target="RFC4090"></xref>),
        while pseudowire redundancy <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy"></xref> supports scenarios where the
        protection for the PW can not be fully provided by the PSN layer (i.e.
        where the backup PW terminates on a different target PE node than the
        working PW). Additionally, GMPLS provides a well known set of control
        plane driven protection and restoration mechanisms <xref
        target="RFC4872"></xref>. MPLS-TP provides additional protection
        mechanisms that are optimised for both linear topologies and ring
        topologies, and that operate in the absence of a dynamic control
        plane. These are specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Different protection schemes apply to different deployment
        topologies and operational considerations. Such protection schemes may
        provide different levels of resiliency. For example, two concurrent
        traffic paths (1+1), one active and one standby path with guaranteed
        bandwidth on both paths (1:1) or one active path and a standby path
        that is shared by one or more other active paths (shared protection).
        The applicability of any given scheme to meet specific requirements is
        outside the current scope of this document.</t>

        <t>The characteristics of MPLS-TP resiliency mechanisms are listed
        below.<list style="symbols">
            <t>Optimised for linear, ring or meshed topologies.</t>

            <t>Use OAM mechanisms to detect and localize network faults or
            service degenerations.</t>

            <t>Include protection mechanisms to coordinate and trigger
            protection switching actions in the absence of a dynamic control
            plane. This is known as an Automatic Protection Switching (APS)
            mechanism.</t>

            <t>MPLS-TP recovery schemes are applicable to all levels in the
            MPLS-TP domain (i.e. MPLS section, LSP and PW), providing segment
            and end-to- end recovery.</t>

            <t>MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms support the coordination of
            protection switching at multiple levels to prevent race conditions
            occurring between a client and its server layer.</t>

            <t>MPLS-TP recovery mechanisms can be data plane, control plane or
            management plane based.</t>

            <t>MPLS-TP supports revertive and non-revertive behavior.</t>

      <section anchor="NETMGT" title="Network Management">
        <t>The network management architecture and requirements for MPLS-TP
        are specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-nm-req"></xref>. It
        derives from the generic specifications described in ITU-T
        G.7710/Y.1701 <xref target="G.7710"></xref> for transport
        technologies. It also incorporates the OAM requirements for MPLS
        Networks <xref target="RFC4377"></xref> and MPLS-TP Networks <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements"></xref> and expands on
        those requirements to cover the modifications necessary for fault,
        configuration, performance, and security in a transport network.</t>

        <t>The Equipment Management Function (EMF) of a MPLS-TP Network
        Element (NE) (i.e. LSR, LER, PE, S-PE or T-PE) provides the means
        through which a management system manages the NE. The Management
        Communication Channel (MCC), realized by the G-ACh, provides a logical
        operations channel between NEs for transferring Management
        information. For the management interface from a management system to
        a MPLS-TP NE, there is no restriction on which management protocol
        should be used. It is used to provision and manage an end-to-end
        connection across a network where some segments are create/managed,
        for examples by Netconf or SNMP and other segments by XML or CORBA
        interfaces. Maintenance operations are run on a connection (LSP or PW)
        in a manner that is independent of the provisioning mechanism. An
        MPLS-TP NE is not required to offer more than one standard management
        interface. In MPLS-TP, the EMF must be capable of statically
        provisioning LSPs for an LSR or LER, and PWs for a PE, as per <xref
        target="static"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Fault Management (FM) functions within the EMF of an MPLS-TP NE
        enable the supervision, detection, validation, isolation, correction,
        and alarm handling of abnormal conditions in the MPLS-TP network and
        its environment. FM must provide for the supervision of transmission
        (such as continuity, connectivity, etc.), software processing,
        hardware, and environment. Alarm handling includes alarm severity
        assignment, alarm suppression/aggregation/correlation, alarm reporting
        control, and alarm reporting.</t>

        <t>Configuration Management (CM) provides functions to control,
        identify, collect data from, and provide data to MPLS-TP NEs. In
        addition to general configuration for hardware, software protection
        switching, alarm reporting control, and date/time setting, the EMF of
        the MPLS-TP NE also supports the configuration of maintenance entity
        identifiers (such as MEP ID and MIP ID). The EMF also supports the
        configuration of OAM parameters as a part of connectivity management
        to meet specific operational requirements. These may specify whether
        the operational mode is one-time on-demand or is periodic at a
        specified frequency.</t>

        <t>The Performance Management (PM) functions within the EMF of an
        MPLS- TP NE support the evaluation and reporting of the behaviour of
        the NEs and the network. One particular requirement for PM is to
        provide coherent and consistent interpretation of the network
        behaviour in a hybrid network that uses multiple transport
        technologies. Packet loss measurement and delay measurements may be
        collected and used to detect performance degradation. This is reported
        via fault management to enable corrective actions to be taken (e.g.
        Protection switching), and via performance monitoring for Service
        Level Agreement (SLA) verification and billing. Collection mechanisms
        for performance data should be should be capable of operating
        on-demand or proactively.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The introduction of MPLS-TP into transport networks means that the
      security considerations applicable to both MPLS and PWE3 apply to those
      transport networks. Furthermore, when general MPLS networks that utilise
      functionality outside of the strict MPLS-TP profile are used to support
      packet transport services, the security considerations of that
      additional functionality also apply.</t>

      <t>The security considerations of <xref target="RFC3985"></xref> and
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-arch"></xref> apply.</t>
