2.  Registration Revocation Extensions and Messages

   The following changes are required for bulk revocation.


   1.  The revocation support extension will include a bit indicating
       whether or not the agent supports bulk revocation.

   2.  The Registration Revocation and Registration Revocation
       Acknowledgment will include a bit indicating whether or not the
       registration is a bulk registration.  If so, the Home Agent
       Address will include a prefix rather than a specific mobile
       node's home address.  Additionally, a previously reserved field
       will now include the prefix length.

   3.  A non-skippable revocation selection extension is added to
       further qualify bulk Registration Revocation.

2.1.  Revocation Support Extension Changes

   The Mobile IP Revocation Support Extension indicates support of
   registration revocation, and so MUST be attached to a Registration
   Request or Registration Reply by any entity that wants to receive
   revocation messages.  The extension is fully described in
   [REVOCATION].  This document includes an indication of whether or not
   bulk revocation is supported for this registration.  Alternately,
   bulk revocation could be negotiated globally between the mobility
   agents using a mechanism beyond the scope of this specification.

   The format of the Revocation Support Extension is based on the Type-
   Length-Value Extension Format given in [MIP4] and is defined in
   [REVOCATION].  Changes are described below:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      Unchanged from [REVOCATION]

   'B' Bit
      This bit is set to '1' by a mobility agent to indicate that bulk
      revocation (as specified herein) is applicable to this binding.

   Reserved
      Reserved for future use.  MUST be set to 0 on sending, MUST be
      ignored on receiving.

   The Mobile IP Revocation Support Extension may appear in either a
   Registration Request or Registration Reply.  'B' bit or bulk
   revocation support will only be in force when negotiated by both
   agents through either the setting of the 'B' bit or a global
   mechanism beyond the scope of this specification.

2.2.  Revocation Selection Extension

   The Mobile IP Revocation Selection Extension is used to further
   qualify bulk revocation (as described herein).  It is only applicable
   to the Registration Revocation and Registration Revocation
   Acknowledgement messages.

   The format of the Revocation Selection Extension is based on the
   Type-Length-Sub-Type-Value Short Extension Format described in
   [MIP4].  It further qualifies the selection of revoked registrations
   specified herein.

   Type
      Non-skippable = TBD

   Length
      Depends on the selection algorithm specified.

   Sub-Type
      Indicates the type of additional selection specified:



      1 - Start/End Home IP Address
         Indicates the TLV contains a starting and ending home IP
         address used to further qualify registration selection.  For
         this sub-type, the length of the TLV will be 10 bytes.

      2 - NAI Regular Expression
         Indicates the TLV contains a regular expression applied to the
         NAI (Network Access Identifier).  This field is only limited by
         the single byte length.  Hence, it can be up to 254 octets in
         length given that the sub-type takes 1 octet.

      3 - Encapsulation
         Indicates the TLV contains a tunnel encapsulation protocol
         identifier.  This indicates that the bulk revocation only
         applies to registrations using the specified tunnel
         encapsulation.  For this sub-type, the length of the TLV will
         be 2 bytes.

   Reserved
      Reserved for future use.  MUST be set to 0 on sending, MUST be
      ignored on receiving.

   Starting Home IP Address
      The starting address in a range of IP home addresses whose
      registrations are to be revoked.

   Ending Home IP Address
      The ending address in a range of IP home addresses whose
      registrations are to be revoked.

   NAI Regular Expression
      A regular expression to be matched against the Network Address
      Identifier (NAI) for registration to determine which registrations
      are to be revoked.  Refer to [NAI] for information on Mobile IP
      Network Access Identifiers.  Refer to [REG-EXPR] for information
      on regular expressions.

   Protocol ID
      The protocol ID corresponding to the tunnel encapsulation:



      94
         IP-in-IP encapsulation [IP-IN-IP]

      47
         Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) [GRE]

      55
         Minimal IP Encapsulation [MIN-IP]

      Unchanged from [REVOCATION]

   A Registration Revocation Acknowledgment message MUST be sent in
   response to a valid and authenticated registration revocation message
   as specified in [REVOCATION].

2.5.  Replay Protection

   Replay protection proceeds in much the same way as described in
   [REVOCATION].  However, when assuring that the message is not a
   replayed message, the mobility agent must check the timestamp to
   assure it is greater than the timestamp received from the most
   recently received Mobility Revocation Support extension from the
   agent.  One way to support this is to maintain the most recent per-
   peer timestamp for peer mobility agents.  For co-located mobile
   nodes, there normally will be only one active registration
   (situations where there are many are beyond the scope of this
   document).

3.  Bulk Registration Revocation Overview

   Bulk Registration Revocation processing is identical to Registration
   Revocation as described in [REVOCATION] except for following
   differences:


   1.  When the Registration Request is received, bulk revocation
       support is negotiated through the setting of the B-Bit in the
       Revocation Support extension.  This negotiation should not
       preclude global bulk revocation negotiation between mobility
       agents.  However, such support is beyond the scope of this
       document.

   2.  When a mobility agent processes a bulk Registration Revocation,
       it may apply to multiple registrations.

   3.  The replay protection validation will now use the timestamp in
       the most recent Revocation Support Extension from the sending
       agent.  This is described in Section 2.5.

3.1.  Home Agent Responsibilities

   Home Agent responsibilities are identical to [REVOCATION] except as
   noted above.  In situations where a single event may apply to
   multiple registrations (or bindings on the Home Agent), a bulk
   revocation may be sent in lieu of multiple revocations.  A non-
   exhaustive list of events that may benefit from bulk revocation
   includes:


   1.  Graceful shutdown of the home agent (HA) instance

   2.  Policy changes that preclude communication with the Foreign Agent
       (FA)

   3.  Withdrawn of the Home Agent local address from service

   4.  Home Address Pool deletion or change

   5.  Other policy change resulting in multiple registrations being
       revoked

3.2.  Foreign Agent Responsibilities

   Foreign Agent responsibilities are identical to [REVOCATION] except
   as noted above.  In situations where a single event may apply to
   multiple registrations (or visitors on the Foreign Agent), a bulk

   revocation may be sent in lieu of multiple revocations.  A non-
   exhaustive list of events that may benefit from bulk revocation
   includes:


   1.  Graceful shutdown of the foreign agent (FA) instance

   2.  Policy changes that preclude communication with the Home Agent
       (HA)

   3.  Withdrawn of the Care-of-Address (CoA) from service

   4.  Other policy change resulting in multiple registrations being
       revoked

3.3.  Direct Co-located Node Responsibilities

   In general, bulk revocation is not the useful to a direct co-located
   node since it will usually only have single registration with a home
   agent.  Hence, there is really no reason for a direct co-located to
   negotiate bulk revocation in the first place by setting the B-Bit in
   the Revocation Support Extension appending to its initial
   registration.  However, this specification does not preclude support
   and a direct co-located node negotiating bulk revocation must support
   bulk revocation requests.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security is basically unchanged from [REVOCATION] with the exception
   that replay protection will be based on the most recent registration
   revocation received from the peer (as described in Section 2.5).  As
   with [REVOCATION], all message exchanges related to revocation MUST
   be protected by either a valid authenticator as specified in [MIP4].
   For communications between mobility agents, FA-HA authentication or a
   mechanism at least as secure, e.g.  IPsec, is required.  For
   communication between a home agent and a direct co-located mobile
   node, MN-HA authentication or a mechanism at least as secure is
   required.  In this context, all message exchanges relating to
   revocation include Registration Revocations, Registration Revocation
   Acknowledgments, Registration Requests including the Revocation
   Support Extension, and Registration Replies including the Revocation
   Support Extension.

5.  IANA Considerations

   A non-skippable extension value is needed for the Revocation
   Selection Extension.  This should be allocated from the "Extensions
   appearing in Mobile IP messages" number space in the "Mobile IPv4
   Numbers".  Also, a new sub-registry is required for the sub-types for
   this extension.  Initially, it will have the following values:

   1 - Start/End Home IP Address
      Indicates the TLV contains a starting and ending home IP address
      used to further qualify registration selection.

   2 - NAI Regular Expression
      Indicates the TLV contains a regular expression applied to the NAI
      (Network Access Identifier).

   3 - Encapsulation
      Indicates the TLV contains a tunnel encapsulation protocol
      identifier.

   Refer to Section 2.2 for more information.
