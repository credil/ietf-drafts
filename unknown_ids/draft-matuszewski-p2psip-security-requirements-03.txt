Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP           July 2008


Abstract

   This document outlines the security requirements for a Peer-to-Peer
   Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) overlay network.  It compares
   security difference between client/server (C/S) and P2P
   implementations of SIP, partitions the P2PSIP architecture into
   layers and analyzes the security issues in each layer and the
   security relationship among the layers.  This draft also classifies
   the application scenarios into two main types and then analyzes in
   detail the security threats with these two types of scenarios.  In
   the end, it summarizes the main security requirements for the P2PSIP
   architecture and its components.

   This draft is a merge of features from the P2PSIP security
   requirements draft and the P2PSIP security analysis and evaluation
   draft and is still a work in progress.

1.  Authors' Notes

   This version -03 represents an initial merge of two drafts:

   o  draft-matuszewski-p2psip-security-requirements-02

   o  draft-song-p2psip-security-eval-00

   with some post-merge editing by Song Haiban, Dan York and Marcin
   Matuszewski.  It is submitted to continue the ongoing dialogue within
   the P2PSIP Working Group around security with the recognition that
   further work needs to be done to complete the merger of the two
   documents.  After IETF 72, the authors intend for the following
   changes to be made to this document:

   o  The merge between the two documents will be completed so that the
      text flows better.

   o  A number of points will be further clarified.

   o  Dan York will be contributing a section on security requirements
      related to interconnection of P2PSIP networks to other networks
      including non-P2P SIP networks and the PSTN.

   While further revisions are already planned, comments are very
   definitely welcome on this -03 version.

2.  Introduction

   The scope of this document is to analyze security threats concerning
   a P2PSIP overlay architecture as described in the concepts and
   terminology for P2PSIP document [1] and list security requirements
   for the architecture and its components.  It compares security
   difference between client/server (C/S) and P2P implementations of
   SIP, partitions the P2PSIP architecture into layers and analyzes the
   security issues in each layer and the security relationship among the
   layers.  This draft also classifies the application scenarios into
   two main types and then analyzes in detail the security threats with
   these two types of scenarios.  In the end, it summarizes the main
   security requirements for the P2PSIP architecture and its components.
   An appendix presents an introduction to security threats to P2PSIP
   environments.

   This document is intended to list the security requirements that must
   be addressed in P2PSIP specifications.  Some solutions to certain
   attacks are given as an example in the analysis text.  This document
   is a merge of features from security requirement draft version 02 [5]
   and security analysis and evaluation draft [6].  It complements the
   P2PSIP Protocol Framework and Requirements document [3].

3.  Definitions

   This section defines a number of concepts that are key to understand
   the rest of the document.

3.1.  General

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

3.2.  P2PSIP network entity

   A P2PSIP network entity is a peer, client, or other functional node
   that may become a part of a P2PSIP overlay.

3.3.  P2PSIP system

   A P2PSIP system consists of the P2PSIP overlay as defined in [1] and
   one or more enrollment servers.  The enrollment servers issue unique
   identities and credentials that are used to authenticate and admit
   P2PSIP network entities to the overlay and allow a user to use
   services provided by the P2PSIP overlay.  The enrollment server may
   also provide an initial set of bootstrap nodes.

3.4.  P2P Overlay Base

   P2P Overlay Base: A P2P Overlay Base includes all the Peers that
       participate in the p2p overlay. The P2P Overlay Base provides
       distributed storage and routing services to both peers and
       clients.

   Trusted P2P Overlay Base: All peers in a Trusted P2P Overlay Base are
       trusted. The Peers in the overlay are all of good behaviors and
       under control due to deployment. For example, a carrier deploys
       a Trusted P2P Overlay Base to provide service to his customers,
       and all the peers are the carrier's devices.

   Untrusted P2P Overlay Base: Peers in a Untrusted P2P Overlay Base
       are not all trusted. There may exist some malicious behaving
       nodes in the P2P Overlay Base.

4.  Security Comparison between C/S and P2P

   In a Client Server(C/S) architecture, a client asks for a specific
   service only from a specific server.  The destination contact
   address(i.e. the address of that server) can be acquired from the
   trusted DNS system directly.  Given this, the security issues exist
   only with the connection between the client and the server.
   Typically, making the connection secure between the client and the
   server addresses most of the security issues related to the client.

   However, in a P2P architecture the security issues are more complex.

   First, where in a C/S architecture specific servers provide certain
   services, in a P2P architecture, each peer in the P2P overlay can
   provide distributed storage and transport services for other P2P
   entities.  There is also no hierarchy of servers but instead the
   peers self-organize into the P2P overlay.

   Second, where in a C/S architecture a client sends its request
   directly to a server, in a P2P architecture a peer sends messages
   through Key-Based-Routing and it doesn't know where the destination
   is.  There exist intermediate nodes between the source and
   destination.

   Third, where in a C/S architecture the client can trust the
   information from the server, in a P2P architecture, one peer does not
   know whether it should trust the information acquired from the
   overlay.

   So in a P2P architecture, security issues not only exist between end
   to end entities, but also between hop by hop services.  They are not
   only related to the routing security, but also related to the content
   security.

5.  Security Analysis with P2P Layers

   The overall security of a P2PSIP system depends upon the security of
   each layer of the P2PSIP architecture.  In this section we split the
   P2PSIP architecture into four main layers, as shown in the following
   figure, and analyze the security issues from the P2PSIP architecture
   perspective.

        +----------+

        Figure 2    P2PSIP architecture

   The four main layers are:

   Transport Layer: Provides transport service for the upper layers.

   Routing Maintenance and KBR Layer: Maintains the routing table, and
   do the Key Based Routing(KBR).  NAT and Firewall traversal may be
   involved to establish direct connections.

   Distributed Storage and Replication Layer: Stores and Manages the
   resource objects.  Each peer's responsible resource objects are
   determined by the specific P2P algorithm.  Replication may be
   utilized to ensure the availability of resource objects under churn.

   Application Layer: Provides the user application, and invokes the
   services provided by the Distributed Storage and Replication Layer.

   The security measures adopted in the lower layer may impact the upper

   layer security choices.  Not every security threat needs to be
   considered in each layer and typically each security threat only
   needs to be solved in one of the layers.  The question of in which
   layer a specific security threat should be solved is addressed in our
   primary analysis of each layer in the following sub-sections.

5.1.  Transport Layer Security

   Given that a P2PSIP overlay can run on top of the Internet or other
   untrusted network, messages between associated nodes should be
   protected against attacks(such as Man-in-the-Middle).  In order to
   establish the identity trust association, nodes SHOULD authenticate
   each other with e.g.  TLS and DTLS.  If transport service security is
   fully protected, we can prevent nodes without valid identities to
   participate in the overlay.  This layer must provides reliable and
   secure hop-by-hop transport service for the P2P overlay.  This alone,
   though, is not enough to secure the P2P system.

5.2.  Routing Maintenance and KBR layer Security

   Each Peer in the P2PSIP overlay provides key-based routing service to
   other peers and a routing maintenance mechanism is used to keep the
   routing table timely and correct for the routing service.  There are
   some security threats with the routing table updating interaction and
   the key-based routing.

   Even if all the nodes participating in the P2PSIP overlay have valid
   identities, the overlay may still be attacked by responding with fake
   routing table to UPDATE requests.  If the routing table is false, the
   routing determination based on it will be false too.  So,
   verification mechanisms SHOULD be adopted to verify if the routing
   table one learned from another is correct or not.  A correct routing
   table is important for hop by hop security.

   Second, some attacker who is not responsible for the destination ID
   may respond to some requests when he is in the intermediate routing
   path(May respond with a fabricated resource object or just says that
   the searched resource object doesn't exist).  Should the source node
   verify whether the response peer is responsible for the request?
   When and how does the source peer do that?  Whether the response peer
   is responsible for the request is important for the end to end
   security.

   Third, some attackers may discard the messages when forwarding, or on
   purpose forward the message to a wrong next hop.  Should the overlay
   need a method to detect the misbehaving forwardings?

   Chosen-ID attack makes the above security issues much more worse.

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP           July 2008


   Fourth, some attacks may cause the overlay under high churn rate.
   For example, some peers may frequently join and leave the overlay.
   Overlay wastes much more traffic to update the routing table, and
   transfer relative resource objects under churn.  It can also make the
   routing messages fail.

      In this case, we need a method to control nodes to join the
      overlay.  The join control entity, which may be a bootstrap server
      or enrollment server, or a bootstrap peer, makes records of peers'
      historical behaviors in the overlay and their historical join
      requests.  When it receives the join request from a peer to join
      the overlay, it checks the historical records as mentioned above
      to determine whether this peer is permitted to join at this point.
      It will deny the node to join the overlay when it determines the
      peer is not permitted to join.  For example, if a peer joins and
      leaves too frequently, it will be denied to join the overlay as a
      peer for a period of time and instead it will be allowed to join
      the overlay as a client.

   The first and fourth issue above is about routing maintenance
   function security, and the remain two issues are about the KBR
   function security.

5.3.  Distributed Storage and Replication Layer Security

   Distributed storage and replication layer provides distributed
   storage service for the resource objects that located in one's
   responsible resource ID range, and the replication service to keep
   the availability of resource objects under churn.  The security
   issues in this layer are typically end to end, and about the content
   and authority security.

   First, We need to protect resource objects when needed against
   unauthorized data operation such as obtainment, modification or
   removing.  A solution for authorization is needed.

   Second, The P2PSIP overlay needs a method to prevent attackers from
   publishing malicious information that will cause a DDOS attack.  For
   example, Peer A may publish a very popular resource record with the
   contact address of Peer B without B's permission.  That causes
   unexpected lots of connections to B which will make Peer B down.
   Using certificate can't solve this problem, a check mechanism for the
   resource object is needed.

   Third, overlays work well for a reasonable amount of resource
   objects, but crash more or less when inserting millions of resource
   objects per node.  Spam attacks can make overlays go down.  Open
   issue: Should the spam attack be considered in the distributed

   layer to handle this problem?

   Replication security is to TODO.

6.  Security Analysis with Application Scenarios

   As described in the security considerations section in application
   scenarios draft[7], the security requirements of the various
   application scenarios vary tremendously.  So in this section, we
   divide the application scenarios into two main types, instead of
   analyzing all the security threats with each specific scenario
   described in the application scenarios draft, we just analyze the
   relative security threats of these two types, which represent most of
   the likely deployment scenarios in the real world.  For example, the
   "Public P2P VoIP Service Providers" scenario in section 4.1.1 of
   application scenarios draft[7] may be deployed using the first
   type(refer to section 5.1 of this specification), and the "Open
   Global P2P VoIP Network" scenario in section 4.1.2 of application
   scenarios draft may be deployed using the second type(refer to
   section 5.2 of this specification).

6.1.  Trusted P2P Overlay Base

   In a trusted P2P Overlay Base, all the peers are deployed with
   trustful nodes.  They are of good behaviors.  They may deployed to
   provide reliable and high quality services, and may also do some
   management issues for the overlay.  All P2PSIP clients access the
   overlay service through the associated trusted peer.  Shown as the
   following figure 3.

   As for this type of scenarios, we regard the P2P Overlay Base to be
   secure.  The security issues to be considered are the transport
   security between trusted peers and the security issues associated
   with clients.  Because clients doesn't provide routing service for
   the overlay.  Security issues more focus on distributed storage
   layer.  Some of the attacks are described in the appendix of this
   draft.

   In an untrusted P2P Overlay Base, there are peers who are not trusted
   by other peers.  Some of untrusted peers may do harmful things or
   abnormal behaviors to the overlay due to malicious or unknown
   intentions.  There may or may not exist trusted peers in the overlay.

   As for this type of scenarios, the security threats with the Trusted
   P2P Overlay Base still exist, besides that, even more security issues
   emerge, because there may exist malicious peers in this type of
   scenarios.  Each layer of the P2PSIP architecture and the enrollment
   may be attacked, the attacks beyond those in the Trusted Overlay Base
   scenarios are listed in the followings Figure 6.

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP           July 2008


7.  Security requirements

   This section describes requirements related to the security of a
   P2PSIP system.  We divided the requirements into user requirements
   and system requirements.

7.1.  User requirements

   The user wants available and reliable service that enables him to
   interact with other users and resources in a secure way.  This means
   that the P2PSIP system MUST provide:

   o  lookup and discovery of users and resources that is secure and
      reliable,

   o  certainty of user and resource identity,

   o  confidentiality and integrity of end-to-end multimedia
      communication,

   o  easy and secure enrollment to the P2PSIP system,

   o  privacy.

7.2.  System requirements

   In order for a P2PSIP system to function properly and that the end
   user gets a proper service, there are several aspects that the P2PSIP
   system must take in to account.

7.2.1.  Dependence of reachability of a centralized server

   Considering the nature of P2P in general, the dependence of
   reachability of a centralized server SHOULD be minimized.  There may
   be unavoidable situations such as the enrollment process, where this
   is not possible.  However, the normal functioning of the P2PSIP
   overlay such as join and leave operations, modification, retrieval
   and deletion of P2PSIP resource (user) records from the P2PSIP system
   should not depend on the reachability of a centralised server.

7.2.2.  Scalability

   P2PSIP security SHOULD scale from a small ad-hoc network to a network
   with hundred millions of network nodes and users.







Song, et al.            Expires January 15, 2009               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP           July 2008


7.2.3.  Preference of existing security mechanisms

   Although P2PSIP defines a new architecture, and thereby new
   interfaces and protocols, for security there are several standardized
   solutions for access control, authentication, integrity protection
   and communication security.  Using established protocols minimizes
   potential security loopholes that need to be patched later.  Besides
   implementation is easer if chosen security protocols are widely
   implemented and used.

7.2.4.  Requirements on a base P2P algorithm

   All of security operations should be specified in such a way that
   they do not impose new unnecessary requirements on a base P2P
   algorithm (e.g., DHT implementations) and limit its scalability.  The
   security issues that are not introduced by the P2P algorith MUST not
   be isolated to the P2P algorithm to solve.

7.2.5.  Node and user identification

   The P2PSIP system MUST preserve user and resource identities.  It
   MUST NOT be possible to steal a P2PSIP identity from another user.

   Because some attackers may try to use identities of another P2PSIP
   network entities it must be possible to verify the identity of
   another party.

7.2.6.  Enrollment

   The ease for users to enroll to a P2PSIP system SHOULD be ensured as
   said in the section 4.1.  The enrollment process defines the set of
   users and P2PSIP network entities that may participate in a P2PSIP
   system and issues them credentials.  This process is defined by the
   P2PSIP system, and the policy who can participate to is done during
   this process.  The enrollment process policy may define:

   o  how many and what user IDs and peer IDs an user or a P2PSIP
      network entity may register,

   o  whether users are charged for the usage of the P2PSIP system,

   o  and how often they must re-new their subscription to the P2PSIP
      system.

   As it was indicated in [3] the enrollment process may take several
   measures in admitting a user or a network node to the P2PSIP system,
   for example:




Song, et al.            Expires January 15, 2009               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP           July 2008


   o  may require strong identity such as employment or identity
      provided by a trusted 3rd party or by the P2PSIP service operator,

   o  may charge for the enrollment,

   o  may apply reputation mechanisms.

   Although the user probably is the entity that enrolls to the P2PSIP
   system, the credentials that are the result of the enrollment are
   used to grant a device the right to function as a peer, client or any
   other operative function possible in the system.  Thus the security
   of enrollment also translates to the security of the device itself
   where the credentials are stored, and threats related to device
   security in general.

7.2.7.  Replay attacks

   An attacker should not be able to repeat or delay valid data
   transmission during enrollment and modification of P2PSIP resource
   (user) records in a P2PSIP overlay.

7.2.8.  Data access

   An attacker MUST NOT be able to easily corrupt, delete, or overwrite
   other user's or resource's data stored in P2PSIP resource (user)
   records as well as routing tables.  Only authorized users MUST be
   able to modify, delete or overwrite their P2PSIP resource (user)
   records in the P2PSIP system.  P2PSIP security should allow users and
   P2PSIP network entities to register the same resources (e.g.
   TURN@overlay.net), however each entity should have rights only to its
   own part of a resource record.  In other words each entity should be
   able to perform the same operations on its part of a resource record
   as on its own resource (user) records.

   The owner of the P2PSIP resource (user) records SHOULD be able to
   authorize other users and network entities to modify, delete their
   P2PSIP resource (user) records.

7.2.9.  Data validation

   First and foremost it MUST be possible to verify that the data stored
   in or retrieved from the P2PSIP overlay is authentic, i.e. was not
   tampered by unauthorized P2PSIP network entities.

   The peer that stores P2PSIP resource (user) records MUST be able to
   validate the data received in the process of P2PSIP resource (user)
   record insertion and modification.

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP           July 2008


7.2.10.  Denial of Service (DOS) attacks

   It MUST NOT be possible to obtain control of the location in the
   overlay where the attacked user's or resource's records are
   registered.  In order to prevent so-called Sybil or join-leave
   attacks the attacker SHOULD NOT be able to easily register a
   unlimited number of IDs of his choice in the P2SIP overlay.  The
   P2PSIP system SHOULD be able to control ID assignment.  Once
   assigned, an ID or a set of IDs SHOULD be difficult to change.

   In addition the P2PSIP architecture SHOULD make sure that data stored
   in a P2PSIP overlay is persistent, meaning that even if a number of
   nodes (but not all of nodes in the overlay) fails the data stored by
   those nodes is not lost.  In addition the attacker MUST NOT be able
   to register unlimited number of resources in the overlay.

7.2.11.  Privacy

   The security of P2PSIP systems MUST guarantee privacy of the P2PSIP
   network participants.  The P2PSIP security SHOULD allow the users and
   P2PSIP network entities to indicate which other users or P2PSIP
   network entities can retrieve, modify, and delete data stored in
   their P2PSIP resource (user) records.  The owner of a P2PSIP resource
   (user) record SHOULD be able to limit the access to his own resource
   (user) records, and this feature should be enforced by the P2P
   network.

   It MUST also be difficult to monitor who is communicating with a
   particular user, or retreive any contextual data about the user
   without the user's explicit consent.  The P2PSIP network entities
   MUST be provided with option to encrypt data exchanged with other
   P2PSIP network entities.

7.2.12.  Detection and rejection of badly behaving nodes

   It SHOULD be possible to limit potential damage caused by
   malfunctioning and badly behaving nodes in a P2PSIP system.  As the
   policy taken by the P2PSIP system operator/community may be very
   liberal, any user can obtain the right to be a user of a P2PSIP
   system.  It may be that some users behave badly intentionally in
   which case it should be possible limit the impact of the badly
   behaving nodes on the overall system security.  It SHOULD be possible
   to identify badly behaving nodes, and exclude or reject them from the
   P2PSIP system.

7.2.13.  Summary of the system requirements

   P2PSIP system requirements related to security issues are summarized
   below:

   Req. 1: Dependence of reachability of a centralized server SHOULD be
   minimized.

   Req. 2: P2PSIP security SHOULD scale from a small ad-hoc network to a
   network with hundred millions of network nodes and users.

   Req. 3: Existing security mechanisms SHOULD be used as much as
   possible to protect P2PSIP functions, and avoid the need for
   standardizing new mechanisms.

   Req. 4: Security requirements on the base P2P algorithm (e.g., DHT
   implementations) used in P2PSIP SHOULD be minimized and SHOULD NOT
   limit its scalability.

   Req. 5: The registered identities in a P2PSIP overlay MUST be
   preserved.  The attacker MUST NOT be able to steal identity from
   another user.

   Req. 6: The enrollment process MUST make it difficult for an attacker
   to register many identities in a P2PSIP overlay and easily modify the
   registered identities.

   Req. 7: It MUST be difficult to select a particular peer ID e.g. peer
   ID assignment process should introduce some degree of randomness to
   peer identities.

   Req. 8: It MUST be possible to authenticate users and P2PSIP network
   entities.

   Req. 9: It MUST NOT be possible to repeat or delay valid data
   transmission during enrollment and modification of P2PSIP resource
   (user) records.

   Req. 10: The P2PSIP security MUST support integrity protection of the
   data being inserted or retrieved to/from an overlay.

   Req. 11: The P2PSIP network entities MUST be provided with an option
   to encrypt data exchanged with other P2PSIP network entities.

   Req. 12: Only authorized users and P2PSIP network entities MUST be
   able to join the P2PSIP system and insert, modify, delete or
   overwrite P2PSIP resource (user) records in the P2PSIP system.

   Req. 13: In the situations where many users or P2PSIP network
   entities register the same resource in the P2PSIP overlay, each
   entity MUST have rights only to its own part of a resource record.

   Req. 14: An owner of P2PSIP resource (user) record MAY indicate which
   users or network entities can retrieve, modify, and delete data
   stored in their P2PSIP resource (user) records.

   Req. 15: P2PSIP overlay protocols MUST be designed such a way so that
   the effect of DOS attacks on the P2PSIP overlay is minimized.

   Req. 16: It SHOULD be possible to limit the impact of badly behaving
   P2PSIP nodes on the overall system security.  There SHOULD be an
   option to identify malfunctioning or badly behaving nodes, and
   exclude or reject them from the P2PSIP system.

11.  Appendix: Security threats

   This section analyses security threats in the Peer-to-Peer SIP
   architecture.

11.1.  Replay Attacks

   Replay attacks are a form of network attacks where a valid data
   transmission is repeated or delayed.  A badly behaving node may take
   an older message sent by another node, resend it to the overlay, and
   thus replace any newer data with the old information present in this
   message.  During those procedures, an attacker may be able to enroll
   credentials for himself, or replace existing entry in the P2PSIP
   overlay by an older entry.  Thus, the architecture must consider this
   issue in the process of both enrollment and modification of P2PSIP
   resource (user) records in a P2PSIP overlay.

   This is especially applicable to P2PSIP overlays that use the
   recursive routing style.  In the recursive routing style, data sent
   in a PUT request traverses many peers in the overlay.  If there is no
   protection against the replay attacks any peer that forwards the
   request may store a copy of the request and resend the captured
   request corrupting data stored in the overlay.

11.2.  Message Insertion, Modification, Deletion

   The message insertion, modification, and deletion attacks are where
   an attacker is able to alter the messages being exchanged between two
   end points.

   P2PSIP peers connect to other peers to form the P2PSIP overlay
   network.  Typically peers provide storage, routing and bootstrap
   services for other peers and clients.  They allow P2PSIP entities to
   PUT information to or GET information from the P2PSIP overlay
   network.  In the P2PSIP overlay that allows for a recursive routing,
   peers are responsible for forwarding messages (requests and
   responses) received from P2PSIP network entities to other peers.
   Depending on the size of the overlay a single message can be
   forwarded by many peers before it reaches a destination.  In the
   iterative routing peers are responsible for redirecting the requests
   to other peers.  They do not forward the requests to other peers.
   They respond to a request originator with an address of a peer that
   should be contacted in the next step.  In such an environment a badly
   behaving peer may:

   o  modify incoming messages,





Song, et al.            Expires January 15, 2009               [Page 28]

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP           July 2008


   o  discard incoming messages (the peer can discard requests and
      responses it is supposed to forward),

   o  generate incorrect responses to requests that are directed to some
      other nodes.

   The first bullet point describes the attack that allows the peer to
   cause the overlay to store unauthorized or outdated information in
   the resource (user) records or return corrupted data to the
   originator of the GET request (a peer or client).  The peer may
   change the data record in the overlay by changing incoming PUT
   messages or modify result of the GET operation by modifying incoming
   GET responses.  With this type of attack the integrity of the P2PSIP
   system can become compromised.

   The middle bullet point is related not only to attacks that allow a
   malicious peer to prevent access to a P2PSIP resource (user) record,
   but also to attacks that can degrade the performance of the P2PSIP
   system making it useless from the end-user perspective.  The second
   problem is of high importance in P2PSIP overlays that store user's
   reachability data which is much more time-critical than content
   stored in file sharing networks.

   The attack described in the last bullet above may lead to a requestor
   receiving corrupted data e.g. a connectivity information that points
   to some other node.  This may happen if a malicious peer can respond
   to incoming requests that are directed to another peer.

   Besides peers may act as relays relaying traffic between two P2PSIP
   network entities or act as a SIP proxy and a SIP registrar.
   Providing those services a malicious peer may perform a similar
   attacks as described above.  Let us consider the following deployment
   scenario where some peers act as SIP registrars or/and SIP proxies
   and allow a conventional SIP UA to access resources of the P2PSIP
   overlay network.  An unmodified SIP UA sends an SIP Invite request
   towards an unknown peer that acts as a SIP proxy.  If the SIP
   messages are not cryptographically protected, this peer may act
   maliciously and proxy a request to other than intended node or modify
   SDP messages in order to stay on the media path.  Similarly a peer
   that acts as a SIP Registrar may modify registration information
   before it sends it to a peer that is responsible for storing the
   P2PSIP user record of a registering SIP UA.  Those attacks do not
   have impact on the integrity of the overlay.  Nevertheless those
   attacks must be addressed by designers of service specific protocols
   such as SIP [4].

11.3.  Man-In-The-Middle

   In man-in-the-middle (m-i-m) attacks a malicious node can hijack a
   connection established between two legitimate nodes, or just listen
   and/or modify messages exchanged between two nodes.  In contrast to
   the attacks presented in Section 3.2 man-in-the middle attacks are
   prevalent in pairing and authentication procedures.

   The m-i-m threat can be mitigated by using well-established
   authentication protocols.  The authentication protocols may be used
   to verify if a certain P2PSIP entity is the entity it claims to be,
   for example if it is really a peer that is identified by a certain
   peer ID.  The authentication protocols can also be used to verify if
   a particular P2PSIP entity belongs to a particular overlay or not.
   However, authentication protocols cannot fully mitigate all of the
   attacks presented in Section 3.2.  There can be malicious peers that
   are authorised overlay participants with a particular peer
   identifiers.

   If a bootstrap process is fully decentralised and a bootstrap node is
   not trusted or authentication of the bootstrap node is not possible,
   then the joining node can easily be attacked, e.g. it may be
   redirected to another overlay or a part of the legacy overlay that is
   controlled by the attacker.  However if it is possible to
   authenticate a particular peer in the overlay the joining peer may
   use P2P specific mechanisms to detect if it is redirected to the
   right overlay or the right place in the overlay.

   Conventional SIP proxy and SIP registrars are servers maintained by a
   service provider.  If a user trust a service provider he also trusts
   servers the service provider maintains.  In P2PSIP SIP proxies and
   registrars can be maintained by users themselves (they can be
   collocated with peers).  In a distributed environment it is very
   difficult to trust all of peers in the overlay.  Without an efficient
   verification mechanism that allows to verify which peers are be
   trusted, peers that act as SIP proxies and registrars may easily
   perform m-i-m attacks.  The problem must be solved by SIP designers
   as well as by the P2PSIP community.

11.4.  Offline Cryptographic Attacks

   The incentive to break a secure system dominates the effort to do so.
   It is likely that P2PSIP systems do not pose a likely target for
   attacks, and if state-of-the art security methods are used, the
   needed effort to break the system by breaking cryptography is very
   likely to be higher than by finding and exploiting software errors
   and vulnerabilities.

11.5.  Unauthorized Usage

   The basic notions of authentication and authorization, when
   implemented correctly and consistently SHOULD protect against
   unauthorized usage of the P2PSIP system.  However, the
   trustworthiness of an identity may be weak i.e. the enrollment system
   might be fairly open and allow devices and persons that wish to
   attack the system.  Thus, there is a significant threat of attacks
   from within the system.

   A malicious peer may do a multitude of attacks towards the overlay
   including:

   o  ignoring, changing, and deleting records in DHT that is it
      responsible for,

   o  misbehaving during data lookups (ie, giving wrong node addresses,
      discarding queries).

   The first bullet point is related to attacks that may cause DHT to
   contain unauthorized, outdated information and/or miss information
   about users or resources.  Each peer is responsible for a part of the
   hash space.  Peers store resource (user) records that fall into their
   part of the hash space.  A malicious peer may modify or delete
   resource (user) records it is supposed to store.  It may also reply
   with incorrect information to the GET requests addressed to resource
   (user) records it is responsible for.  In addition it may ignore any
   record updates.  These attacks are not limited to peers that are
   responsible for primary copies of resource (user) records.  They are
   also related to peers that store replicas of resource (user) records.
   Besides a bootstrap node may also respond with wrong bootstraping
   information.

   The second bullet point addresses attacks that may impact correctness
   of routing mechanisms.  If the recoursive routing is used a malicious
   peer can forward messages to another malicious node rather than
   forwarding the messages according to the legitimate routing
   information.  This may also impact the iterative routing being
   corrupted when the peer redirects the requester to a malicious node.

11.6.  Inappropriate Usage

   The P2PSIP essentially provides a distributed storage for P2PSIP
   resource (user) records.  The data stored in the distributed database
   can be used in an inappropriate manner.  If there is no access
   control to a resource (user) records stored in the overlay and any
   node can update or retrieve information stored in the overlay.  An
   attacker may request data stored in the P2PSIP resource (user)



Song, et al.            Expires January 15, 2009               [Page 31]

Internet-Draft       Security requirements in P2PSIP           July 2008


   records and perform inappropriate usage attacks.  Besides the
   attacker may also update entries of other users or resources.

   The individual services provided by P2PSIP (messaging, real-time
   communication) have their respective threat models regarding
   inappropriate use (Spam, viruses, ...) but these can be considered
   out of scope for this document.

11.7.  Denial of Service

   In the P2PSIP architecture [1], the P2PSIP resource (user) records
   are not maintained in a central, trustworthy storage system, rather
   they are distributed among peers participating in the system.
   Routing, relaying, SIP proxy and registrar services are also
   distributed among P2PSIP entities.  In cases where authentication in
   the P2PSIP overlay is weak or where the system is fairly open to new
   participants the "infiltration" is trivial (e.g., Sybil attack).

   If peers in the P2PSIP overlay can freely choose peer IDs or/and
   easily modify previously selected peer IDs the attacker may use join-
   leave attacks to place a malicious peer intentionally at any location
   in overlay.  Placing the peer at any location allows an attacker to
   obtain control of the location in the overlay where the attacked user
   or resource is registered.  A malicious peer may discard, modify the
   data it is supposed to store and may discard lookup requests or reply
   with incorrect entries to the incoming requests.

   The attacker may also try to register a large number of resources to
   the P2PSIP overlay increasing processing load on peers that are
   responsible for storing the resources and limiting the overall
   capacity of the P2PSIP overlay network.  It may also try to register
   all popular names preventing the name holders from registering their
   preferred URIs.

   Another critical point where a D-o-S attack can be mounted is the
   enrollment system.

11.8.  Communication security threats

   The main places where communication security becomes an issue in the
   P2PSIP context is the enrollment process and the communication
   between endpoints.  The last ones are subject to all typical threats
   in this domain, however they have been individually considered in the
   earlier sections of this chapter.

   This document assumes that the actual SIP service implementation
   provides its own communication security, and that P2PSIP adds to that
   only in providing a means for the communication endpoints to

   establish a shared key for further security needs.  Otherwise, the
   communication security threats in that domain is out-of-scope for
   this discussion.
