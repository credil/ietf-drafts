    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document requests one Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
      from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for a class of
      real-time traffic. This class conforms to the <xref target="RFC3246">
      Expedited Forwarding </xref> <xref target="RFC3247"></xref> Per Hop
      Behavior. It is also admitted using a CAC procedure involving
      authentication, authorization, and capacity admission. This differs from
      a real-time traffic class conforming to the Expedited Forwarding Per Hop
      Behavior but not subject to capacity admission or subject to very coarse
      capacity admission.</t>

      <t>It also recommends that certain classes of video described in <xref
      target="RFC4594"></xref> be treated as requiring capacity admission as
      well.</t>

      <t>These applications have one or more potential congestion points
      between the endpoints. Reserving capacity for them is important to
      application performance. All of these applications have low tolerance to
      jitter (aka delay variation) and loss, as summarized in <xref
      target="implementation"></xref>, and most (except for multimedia
      conferencing) have inelastic flow behavior from Figure 1 of <xref
      target="RFC4594"></xref>. Inelastic flow behavior and low jitter/loss
      tolerance are the service characteristics that define the need for
      admission control behavior.</t>

      <t>One of the reasons behind this is the need for classes of traffic
      that are handled under special policies, such as the non-preemptive
      Emergency Telecommunication Service, the US Department of Defense's
      Assured Service (which is similar to <xref target="ITU.MLPP.1990">
      Multi-Level Precedence and Preemption</xref> procedure), or e-911, in
      addition to normal routine calls that use call admission. It is possible
      to use control plane protocols to generally restrict session admission
      such that admitted traffic should receive the desired service, and the
      policy (e.g. Routine, National Security or Emergency Preparedness
      [NS/EP] communications, e-911, etc) need not be signaled in a DSCP.
      However, service providers need to distinguish between special-policy
      traffic and other classes, particularly the existing VoIP services that
      perform no capacity admission or only very coarse capacity admission and
      can exceed their allocated resources.</t>

      <t>The requested DSCP applies to the Telephony Service Class described
      in <xref target="RFC4594"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Since video classes have not had the history of mixing admitted and
      non-admitted traffic in the same Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) as has occurred
      for EF, an additional DSCP code point is not recommended. Instead, the
      recommended "best practice" is to perform admission control for all
      traffic in three of <xref target="RFC4594"></xref>'s video classes: the
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>Interactive Real-Time Traffic (CS4, used for Video conferencing
          and Interactive gaming),</t>

          <t>Broadcast TV (CS3) for use in a video on demand context, and</t>

          <t>AF4 Multimedia Conferencing (video conferencing).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Other video classes are believed to not have the current problem of
      confusion with unadmitted traffic and therefore would not benefit from
      the notion of a separate DSCP for admitted traffic. Within an ISP and on
      inter-ISP links (i.e. within networks whose internal paths are uniform
      at hundreds of megabits or faster), one would expect all of this traffic
      to be carried in the Real Time Traffic Class described in <xref
      target="RFC5127"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Definitions">
        <t>The following terms and acronyms are used in this document.</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="PHB:">A Per-Hop-Behavior (PHB) is the externally
            observable forwarding behavior applied at a Differentiated
            Services compliant node to a DS behavior aggregate <xref
            target="RFC2475"></xref>. It may be thought of as a program
            configured on the interface of an Internet host or router,
            specified drop probabilities, queuing priorities or rates, and
            other handling characteristics for the traffic class.</t>

            <t hangText="DSCP:">The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP),
            as defined in <xref target="RFC2474"></xref>, is a value which is
            encoded in the DS field, and which each DS Node MUST use to select
            the PHB which is to be experienced by each packet it forwards
            <xref target="RFC3260"></xref>. It is a 6-bit number embedded into
            the 8-bit TOS field of an IPv4 datagram or the Traffic Class field
            of an IPv6 datagram.</t>

            <t hangText="CAC:">Call Admission Control includes concepts of
            authorization and capacity admission. "Authorization" refers to
            any procedure that identifies a user, verifies the authenticity of
            the identification, and determines whether the user is authorized
            to use the service under the relevant policy. "Capacity Admission"
            refers to any procedure that determines whether capacity exists
            supporting a session's requirements under some policy. <vspace
            blankLines="1" /> In the Internet, these are separate functions,
            while in the PSTN they and call routing are carried out
            together.</t>

            <t hangText="UNI:">A User/Network Interface (UNI) is the interface
            (often a physical link or its virtual equivalent) that connects
            two entities that do not trust each other, and in which one (the
            user) purchases connectivity services from the other (the
            network). <xref target="UNI-NNI"></xref> shows two user networks
            connected by what appears to each of them to be a single network
            ("The Internet", access to which is provided by their service
            provider) that provides connectivity services to other users.
            <vspace blankLines="1" /> UNIs tend to be the bottlenecks in the
            Internet, where users purchase relatively low amounts of bandwidth
            for cost or service reasons, and as a result are most subject to
            congestion issues and therefore issues requiring traffic
            conditioning and service prioritization.</t>

            <t hangText="NNI:">A Network/Network Interface (NNI) is the
            interface (often a physical link or its virtual equivalent) that
            connects two entities that trust each other within limits, and in
            which the two are seen as trading services for value. <xref
            target="UNI-NNI"></xref> shows three service networks that
            together provide the connectivity services that we call "the
            Internet". They are different administrations and are very
            probably in competition, but exchange contracts for connectivity
            and capacity that enable them to offer specific services to their
            customers. <vspace blankLines="1" /> NNIs may not be bottlenecks
            in the Internet if service providers contractually agree to
            provision excess capacity at them, as they commonly do. However,
            NNI performance may differ by ISP, and the performance guarantee
            interval may range from a month to a much shorter period.
            Furthermore, a peering point NNI may not have contractual
            performance guarantees or may become overloaded under certain
            conditions. They are also policy-controlled interfaces, especially
            in BGP. As a result, they may require traffic prioritization
            policy.</t>

            <t hangText="Queue:">There are multiple ways to build a
            multi-queue scheduler. Weighted Round Robin (WRR) literally builds
            multiple lists and visits them in a specified order, while a
            calendar queue (often used to implement Weighted Fair Queuing, or
            WFQ) builds a list for each time interval and enqueues at most a
            stated amount of data in each such list for transmission during
            that time interval. While these differ dramatically in
            implementation, the external difference in behavior is generally
            negligible when they are properly configured. Consistent with the
            definitions used in the <xref target="RFC2475"> Differentiated
            Services Architecture </xref>, these are treated as equivalent in
            this document, and the lists of WRR and the classes of a calendar
            queue will be referred to uniformly as "queues".</t>

      <section title="Problem">
        <t>In short, the Telephony Service Class described in <xref
        target="RFC4594"></xref> permits the use of capacity admission in
        implementing the service, but present implementations either provide
        no capacity admission services or do so in a manner that depends on
        specific traffic engineering. In the context of the Internet backbone,
        the two are essentially equivalent; the edge network depends on
        specific engineering by the service provider that may not be present,
        especially in a mobile environment.</t>

        <t>However, services are being requested of the network that would
        specifically make use of capacity admission, and would distinguish
        among users or the uses of available Voice-over-IP or Video-over-IP
        capacity in various ways. Various agencies would like to provide
        services as described in section 2.6 of <xref target="RFC4504"></xref>
        or in <xref target="RFC4190"></xref>. This requires the use of
        capacity admission to differentiate among users (which might be 911
        call centers, other offices with preferential service contracts, or
        individual users gaining access with special credentials) to provide
        services to them that are not afforded to non-capacity admitted
        customer-to-customer IP telephony sessions.</t>

      <section anchor="data-plane"
               title="Potential implementations of EF in this model">
        <t>There are at least two possible ways to implement isolation between
        the Capacity Admitted PHB and the Expedited Forwarding PHB in this
        model. They are to implement separate classes as a set of <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Multiple data plane traffic classes, each consisting of a
            policer and a queue, and the queues enjoying different priorities,
            or</t>

            <t>Multiple data plane traffic classes, each consisting of a
            policer but feeding into a common queue or multiple queues at the
            same priority.</t>
          </list> We will explain the difference, and describe in what way
        they differ in operation. The reason this is necessary is that there
        is current confusion in the industry.</t>

        <t>The multi-priority model is shown in <xref
        target="priority-schematic"></xref>. In this model, traffic from each
        service class is placed into a separate priority queue. If data is
        present in both queues, traffic from one of them will always be
        selected for transmission. This has the effect of transferring jitter
        from the higher priority queue to the lower priority queue, and
        reordering traffic in a way that gives the higher priority traffic a
        smaller average queuing delay. Each queue must have its own policer,
        however, to protect the network from errors and attacks; if a traffic
        class thinks it is carrying a certain data rate but an abuse sends
        significantly more, the effect of simple prioritization would not
        preserve the lower priorities of traffic, which could cause routing to
        fail or otherwise impact an SLA.</t>

        <t>The multi-policer model is shown in <xref
        target="policer-schematic"></xref>. In this model, traffic from each
        service class is policed according to its SLA requirements, and then
        placed into a common priority queue. Unlike the multi-priority model,
        the jitter experienced by the traffic classes in this case is the
        same, as there is only one queue, but the sum of the traffic in this
        higher priority queue experiences less average jitter than the elastic
        traffic in the lower priority.</t>

        <t>The difference between the two operationally is, as stated, the
        issues of loss due to policing and distribution of jitter.</t>

        <t>If the two traffic classes are, for example, voice and video,
        datagrams conaining video data can be relatively large (often of
        variable sizes up to the path MTU) while datagrams containing voice
        are relatively small, on the order of only 40 to 200 bytes, depending
        on the codec. On lower speed links (less than 10 MBPS), the jitter
        introduced by video to voice can be disruptive, while at higher speeds
        the jitter is nominal compared to the jitter requirements of voice. At
        access network speeds, therefore, <xref target="RFC4594"></xref>
        recommends separation of video and voice into separate queues, while
        at optical speeds <xref target="RFC5127"></xref> recommends that they
        use a common queue.</t>

        <t>If, on the other hand, the two traffic classes are carrying the
        same type of application with the same jitter requirements, then
        giving one preference in this sense does not benefit the higher
        priority traffic and may harm the lower priority traffic. In such a
        case, using separate policers and a common queue is a superior
        approach.</t>

      <section anchor="CAC" title="Capacity admission control">
        <t>There are at least six major ways that capacity admission is done
        or has been proposed to be done for real-time applications. Each will
        be described below, then Section 3 will judge which ones are likely to
        meet the requirements of the Admitted Telephony service class. These
        include: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Drop Precedence used to force sessions to voluntarily exit,</t>

            <t>Capacity admission control by assumption or engineering,</t>

            <t>Capacity admission control by call counting,</t>

            <t>End-point capacity admission performed by probing the
            network,</t>

            <t>Centralized capacity admission control via bandwidth broker,
            and</t>

            <t>Distributed capacity admission control using protocols such as
            RSVP or NSIS.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The problem with capacity admission by assumption, which is widely
        reployed in today's VoIP environment, is that it depends on the
        assumptions made. One can do careful traffic engineering to ensure
        needed bandwidth, but this can also be painful, and has to be
        revisited when the network is changed or network usage changes.</t>

        <t>The problem with dropping traffic to force users to hang up is that
        it affects a broad class of users - if there is capacity for N calls
        and the N+1 calls are active, data is dropped randomly from all
        sessions to ensure that offered load doesn't exceed capacity. On very
        fast links, that is acceptable, but on lower speed links it can
        seriously affect call quality.</t>

        <t>There are two fundamental problems with depending on the endpoint
        to perform capacity admission; it may not be able to accurately
        measure the impact of the traffic it generates on the network, and it
        tends to be greedy (eg., it doesn't care). If the network operator is
        providing a service, he must be able to guarantee the service, which
        means that he can't trust systems that are not controlled by his
        network.</t>

        <t>The problem with mechanisms that don't enable the association of a
        policy with the request is that they don't allow for multi-policy
        services, which are becoming important.</t>

        <t>The operator's choice of admission procedure must, for this DSCP,
        ensure the following:<list style="symbols">
            <t>The actual links that a session uses have enough bandwidth to
            support it.</t>

            <t>New sessions are refused admission if there is inadequate
            bandwidth under the relevant policy.</t>

            <t>If multiple policies are in use in a network, that the user is
            identified and the correct policy applied.</t>

            <t>Under periods of network stress, the process of admission of
            new sessions does not disrupt existing sessions, unless the
            service explicitly allows for disruption of calls.</t>

      <section title="Recommendations on implementation of an Admitted Telephony Service Class">
        <t>It is the belief of the authors that either PHB implementation
        described in <xref target="data-plane"></xref>, if coupled with
        adequate AAA and capacity admission procedures as described in <xref
        target="CAC"></xref>, are sufficient to provide the services required
        for an Admitted Telephony service class. If preemption is required, as
        described in section 2.3.5.2 of <xref target="RFC4542"></xref>, this
        provides the tools for carrying out the preemption. If preemption is
        not in view, or if used in addition to preemptive services, the
        application of different thresholds depending on call precedence has
        the effect of improving the probability of call completion by
        admitting preferred calls at a time that other calls are being
        refused. Routine and priority traffic can be admitted using the same
        DSCP value, as the choice of which calls are admitted is handled in
        the admission procedure executed in the control plane, not the
        policing of the data plane.</t>

        <t>On the point of what protocols and procedures are required for
        authentication, authorization, and capacity admission, we note that
        clear standards do not at this time exist for bandwidth brokers, NSIS
        has not at this time been finalized and in any event is limited to
        unicast sessions, and that RSVP has been standardized and has the
        relevant services. We therefore recommend the use of RSVP at the UNI.
        Procedures at the NNI are business matters to be discussed between the
        relevant networks, and are recommended but not required.</t>

    <section title="Summary: changes from RFC 4594">
      <t>To summarize, there are two changes to <xref target="RFC4594"></xref>
      discussed in this document:<list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Telephony class:">The Telephony Service Class in RFC
          4594 does not involve capacity admission, but depends on application
          layer admission that only estimates capacity, and that through
          static engineering. In addition to that class, a separate Admitted
          Telephony Class is added which performs capacity admission
          dynamically.</t>

          <t hangText="Video classes">Capacity admission is added to three
          video classes. These are the Interactive Real-Time Traffic class,
          Broadcast TV class when used for video on demand, and the Multimedia
          Conferencing class.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This note requests that IANA assign a DSCP value to a second EF
      traffic class consistent with <xref target="RFC3246"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC3247"></xref> in the "Differentiated Services Field
      Codepoints" registry. It implements the Telephony Service Class
      described in <xref target="RFC4594"></xref> at lower speeds and is
      included in the <xref target="RFC5127">Real Time Treatment
      Aggregate</xref> at higher speeds. The recommended value for the code
      point is 101100, paralleling the EF code point, which is 101110. The
      code point should be referred to as VOICE-ADMIT.</t>

      <t>This traffic class requires the use of capacity admission such as
      RSVP services together with AAA services at the User/Network Interface
      (UNI); the use of such services at the NNI is at the option of the
      interconnected networks.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>A major requirement of this service is effective use of a signaling
      protocol such as RSVP, with the capabilities to identify its user either
      as an individual or as a member of some corporate entity, and assert a
      policy such as "routine" or "priority".</t>

      <t>This capability, one has to believe, will be abused by script kiddies
      and others if the proof of identity is not adequately strong or if
      policies are written or implemented improperly by the carriers. This
      goes without saying, but this section is here for it to be said...</t>
