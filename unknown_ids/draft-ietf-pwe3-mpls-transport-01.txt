1.  Introduction

   The operator community has identified the need for the transparent
   carriage of the MPLS network of one party over the MPLS network of
   another party.  This document describes one IETF-recommended
   mechanism to satisfy this requirement using the existing RFC4448
   [RFC4448] PWE3 Ethernet pseudowire standard.  The mechanism described
   here fulfills the requirements liaised to the IETF PWE3 working group
   by the ITU: - [1]and [2].

   The key purpose of this document is to demonstrate that there is an
   existing IETF-recommended mechanism that satisfies the requirements
   posed by the operator community.  It is recognised that it is
   possible to design a more efficient method of satisfying the
   requirement, and the IETF anticipates that improved solutions will be
   proposed in the future.

   The architecture required for this mechanism is illustrated in Figure
   1 below.

   Figure 1: Application Ethernet over MPLS PW to MPLS Transport
   Networks

   An 802.3 (Ethernet) circuit is established between CE1 and CE2.  This
   circuit may be used for the concurrent transport of MPLS packets as
   well as IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  The MPLS packets may carry IPv4,
   IPV6, or Pseudowire payloads, and Penultimate-Hop-Popping (PHP) may
   be used.  For clarity these paths are labeled as the client in Figure
   1.

   An Ethernet pseudowire (PW) is provisioned between PE1 and PE2 and
   used to carry the Ethernet from PE1 to PE2.  The Ethernet PW is
   carried over an MPLS PSN, but this PSN MUST NOT be configured with
   PHP.  For clarity this Ethernet PW and the MPLS PSN are labeled as
   the server in Figure 1.  In the remainder of this draft call the
   server network a transport network.

2.  PWE3 Configuration

   The PWE3 encapsulation used by this specification to satisfy the
   transport requirement is Ethernet RFC4448 [RFC4448].  This is used in
   "raw" mode.

   The Control Word MUST be used.  The Sequence number MUST be zero.

   The use of the Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Label Distribution
   Protocol RFC4447 [RFC4447] is not required by the profile of the PWE3
   Ethernet pseudowire functionality defined in this document.

   The Pseudowire Label is statically provisioned.


3.  OAM

   Within a connection, traffic units sent from the single source are
   constrained to stay within the connection under defect-free
   conditions.  During misconnected defects, a connection can no longer
   be assumed to be constrained and traffic units (and by implication
   also OAM packets) can 'leak' uni-directionally outside a connection.
   Therefore during a misconnected state, it is not possible to rely on
   OAM which relies on a request/response mechanism ; and, for this
   reason such OAM should be treated with caution if used for diagnostic
   purposes.

   Further, when implementing an ECMP function with MPLS, use of the
   label stack as the path selector such that the OAM and data are not
   in a co-path as any failure in the data path will note be reflected
   in the OAM path.  Therefore, an OAM that is carried within the data-
   path below the PW label such as VCCV is NOT vulnerable to the above
   failure mode.  For these reasons the OAM mechanism is VCCV
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-vccv], using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BDF)
   BFD [I-D.ietf-bfd-base] for connection verification (CV).  The method
   of using BFD as a CV method in VCCV is described in
   [I-D.draft-nadeau-pwe3-vccv-bfd] .  One of the VCCV profiles
   described in Section 3.1 or Section 3.2 MUST be used.  Once a VCCV is
   provisioned, and the operational status of the PW is UP, no other
   profile SHOULD be used until such time as the PW's operational status
   is set to DOWN.

3.1.  VCCV profile 1: BFD without IP/UDP Headers

   When PE1 and PE1 are not IP capable or have not been configured with
   IP addresses, the following VCCV mechanism SHOULD be used.

   The connection verification method used by VCCV is BFD with

   diagnostics as defined in [I-D.draft-nadeau-pwe3-vccv-bfd].

   VCCV [I-D.ietf-pwe3-vccv] specifies that the first nibble is set to
   0x1 to indicate a channel associated with a pseudowire RFC4385
   [RFC4385].

   The Version and the Reserved fields are set to 0, and the Channel
   Type is set to [TBD] to indicate that the payload carried is BFD
   without IP/UDP headers, as is defined in
   [I-D.draft-nadeau-pwe3-vccv-bfd].

3.2.  VCCV profile 2: BFD with IP/UDP Headers

   When PE1 and PE1 are IP capable and have been configured with IP
   addresses, the following VCCV mechanism MAY be used.

   The connection verification method used by VCCV is BFD with
   diagnostics as defined in [I-D.draft-nadeau-pwe3-vccv-bfd].

   VCCV [I-D.ietf-pwe3-vccv]specifies that the first nibble is set to
   0x1 to indicate a channel associated with a pseudowire RFC4385
   [RFC4385].

   The Version and the Reserved fields are set to 0, and the Channel
   Type is set to 0x21 for IPv4 and 0x56 for IPv6 payloads RFC4446
   [RFC4446].


4.  MPLS Layer

   The architecture of MPLS enabled networks is described in RFC3031
   [RFC3031] PSN .  This section describes a subset of the functionality
   of the MPLS enabled PSN.  There are two cases that need to be
   considered:

   1.  The case where external configuration is used.

   2.  The case where a control plane is available.

   Where the use of a control plane is desired this may be based on
   GMPLS[RFC3945]

4.1.  External Configuration

   The use of external provisioning is not precluded from being
   supported by the current MPLS specifications.  It is however
   expicitly described in this specification to addess the requirements
   specified by the ITU <https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/



Bryant, et al.          Expires November 2, 2007                [Page 6]

   liaison_detail.cgi?detail_id=286> and <https://datatracker.ietf.org/
   public/liaison_detail.cgi?detail_id=287> to address the needs in a
   transport environment.

   The MPLS encapsulation is specified inRFC3032 [RFC3032].  All MPLS
   labels used in the server layer (Figure 1) MUST be statically
   provisioned.  Labels may be selected from either the per-platform or
   the per-interface label space.

   All transport LSPs utilized by the PWs described in section 2 MUST
   support both unidirectional and bi-directional point-to-point
   connections.

   The transport LSPs SHOULD support unidirectional point-to-multipoint
   connections.

   The forward and backward directions of a bi-directional connection
   should follow a symmetrically routed (reciprocal) LSP in the server
   network.

   Equal cost multi-path (ECMP) load balancing MUST NOT be configured on
   the transport LSPs utilized by the PWs described in sections 2.

   The merging of label switched paths is prohibited and MUST NOT be
   configured for the transport LSPs utilized by the PWs described in
   section 2.

   Penultimate hop popping by the transport LSRs MUST be disabled on
   transport LSPs.

   Both E-LSP and L-LSP MUST be supported as defined in RFC3270
   [RFC3270].

   For the MPLS EXP field RFC3270 [RFC3270] only the pipe and short-pipe
   models are supported.

4.2.  Control Plane Configuration

   In this section we describe the control plane configuration
   whenRFC3209 [RFC3209] "RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"
   or the bi-directional support in GMPLS RFC3471 [RFC3471] "Generalized
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Functional
   Description" andRFC3473 [RFC3473] "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic
   Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions" are used to configure the transport
   MPLS PSN.  When these protocols are used to provide the control plane
   the following are automatically provided:

   1.  There is no label merging unless it is deliberately enabled to
       support Fast Re-route (FRR) RFC3209 [RFC3209].

   2.  A single path is provided end-to-end (there is no ECMP).

   3.  Label switched paths may be unidirectional or bidirectional as
       required.

   Additionally the following configurations restrictions required to
   support external configuration MUST be applied:

   o  Penultimate hop popping by the LSRs MUST be disabled on LSPs
      providing PWE3 transport network functionality NOPHP
      [I-D.ali-mpls-rsvp-te-no-php-oob-mapping].

   o  Both E-LSP and L-LSP MUST be supported as defined in RFC3270
      [RFC3270].

   o  The MPLS EXP field is supported according to RFC3270 for only when
      the pipe and short-pipe models are utilized.


5.  Congestion Considerations

   This draft describes a method of using the existing RFC4448 [RFC4448]
   PWE3 Ethernet pseudowire to solve a particular network application.
   The congestion considerations associated with that pseudowire and all
   subsequent work on congestion considerations regarding Ethernet
   pseudowires is applicable to this draft.


6.  Security Considerations

   This draft is a description of the use of existing IETF proposed
   standards to solve a network problem, and raises no new security
   issues.

   The PWE3 security considerations are described in RFC3985
   [RFC3985]and the Ethernet pseudowire security consoderations RFC4448
   [RFC4448]

   The Ethernet pseudowire is transported on an MPLS PSN; therefore, the
   security of the pseudowire itself will only be as good as the
   security of the MPLS PSN.  The server MPLS PSN can be secured by
   various methods, as described in RFC3031. [RFC3031]

   The use of static configuration exposes an MPLS PSN to a different
   set of security risks to those found in a PSN using dynamic routing.

Internet-Draft  Appln of Ethernet PW to MPLS Xport Netwks       May 2007


   If a path is missconfigured in a staticly configued network the
   result can be a persistent black hole, or much worst, a persistent
   forwarding loop.  On the otherhand most of the distributed components
   are less complex.  This is however offset by the need to provide
   failover and redundancy in the management and configuration system
   and the communications paths between those central systems and the
   LSRs.

   Security achieved by access control of MAC addresses , and the
   security of the client layers is out of the scope of this document.


7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA actions required by this draft.
