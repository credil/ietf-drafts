Internet-Draft       SPEERMINT Peering Architecture          August 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a reference peering architecture in the context
   of session peering for multimedia interconnects.  In this process, we
   define the peering reference architecture, its functional components,
   and peering interface functions from the perspective of a SIP Service
   providers [RFC5486] network.

   This architecture allows the interconnection of two SSPs in layer 5
   peering as defined in the SIP-based session peering requirements
   [I-D.draft-ietf-speermint-requirements-09].

   Layer 3 peering is outside the scope of this document.  Hence, the
   figures in this document do not show routers so that the focus is on
   Layer 5 protocol aspects.

   This document uses terminology defined in the Session Peering for
   Multimedia Interconnect Terminology document [RFC5486].


2.  Reference Architecture

   The following figure depicts the architecture and logical functions
   that form peering between two SSPs.

3.  Procedures of Inter-domain SSP Session Establishment

   This document assumes that in order for a session to be established
   from a UA in the Originating SSP's network to an UA in the Target
   SSP's network the following steps are taken:

   1.  Determine the target SSP via the LUF.  (Note: If the target
       address represents an intra-SSP resource, the behavior is out-of-
       scope with respect to this draft.)

   2.  Determine the address of the SF of the target SSP via the LRF.

   3.  Establish the session

Internet-Draft       SPEERMINT Peering Architecture          August 2010


   4.  Exchange the media, which could include voice, video, text, etc.

   5.  End the session (BYE)

   The originating SSP would likely perform steps 1-4, and the target
   SSP would likely perform steps 4-5.

   In the case the target SSP changes, then steps 1-4 would be repeated.
   This is reflected in Figure 1 that shows the target SSP with its own
   peering functions.


4.  Relationships Between Functions/Elements

   o  An SBE can contain a SF function.

   o  An SF can perform LUF and LRF functions.

   o  As an additional consideration, a Session Border Controller, can
      contain an SF, SBE and DBE, and may perform the LUF and LRF
      functions.

   o  The following functions can communicate as follows, depending upon
      various real-world implementations:

      *  SF can communicate with LUF, LRF, SBE and SF

      *  LUF can communicator with SF and SBE

      *  LRF can communicate with SF and SBE


5.  Recommended SSP Procedures

   This section describes the functions in more detail and provides some
   recommendations on the role they would play in a SIP call in a Layer
   5 peering scenario.

   Some of the information in the section is taken from
   [I-D.draft-ietf-speermint-requirements-09] and is put here for
   continuity purposes.

5.1.  Originating SSP Procedures

5.1.1.  The Look-Up Function (LUF)

   Purpose is to determine the SF of the target domain of a given
   request and optionally develop Session Establishment Data.

5.1.1.1.  Target Address Analysis

   When the originating SSP receives a request to communicate, it
   analyzes the target URI to determine whether the call needs to be
   routed internal or external to its network.  The analysis method is
   internal to the SSP; thus, outside the scope of SPEERMINT.

   If the target address does not represent a resource inside the
   originating SSP?s administrative domain or federation of domains,
   then the originating SSP performs a Lookup Function (LUF) to
   determine a target address, and then is resolves the call routing
   data by using the Location routing Function (LRF).

   For example, if the request to communicate is for an im: or pres: URI
   type, the originating SSP follows the procedures in [8].  If the
   highest priority supported URI scheme is sip: or sips: the
   originating SSP skips to SIP DNS resolution in Section 5.1.3.
   Likewise, if the target address is already a sip: or sips: URI in an
   external domain, the originating SSP skips to SIP DNS resolution in
   Section 4.1.2.1.

   If the target address corresponds to a specific E.164 address, the
   SSP may need to perform some form of number plan mapping according to
   local policy.  For example, in the United States, a dial string
   beginning "011 44" could be converted to "+44", or in the United
   Kingdom "00 1" could be converted to "+1".  Once the SSP has an E.164
   address, it can use ENUM.

5.1.1.2.  ENUM Lookup

   If an external E.164 address is the target, the originating SSP
   consults the public "User ENUM" rooted at e164.arpa, according to the
   procedures described in RFC 3761.  The SSP must query for the "E2U+
   sip" enumservice as described in RFC 3764 [11], but MAY check for
   other enumservices.  The originating SSP MAY consult a cache or
   alternate representation of the ENUM data rather than actual DNS
   queries.  Also, the SSP may skip actual DNS queries if the
   originating SSP is sure that the target address country code is not
   represented in e164.arpa.  If a sip: or sips: URI is chosen the SSP
   skips to Section 5.1.6.

   If an im: or pres: URI is chosen for based on an "E2U+im" [8] or
   "E2U+pres" [9] enumserver, the SSP follows the procedures for
   resolving these URIs to URIs for specific protocols such a SIP or
   XMPP as described in the previous section.

Internet-Draft       SPEERMINT Peering Architecture          August 2010


5.1.2.  Location Routing Function (LRF)

   The LRF of an Originating SSP analyzes target address and target
   domain identified by the LUF, and discovers the next hop signaling
   function (SF) in a peering relationship.  The resource to determine
   the SF of the target domain might be provided by a third-party as in
   the assisted-peering case.  The following sections define mechanisms
   which may be used by the LRF.  These are not in any particular order
   and, importantly, not all of them may be used.

5.1.2.1.  DNS resolution

   The originating SSP uses the procedures in RFC 3263 [4] Section 4 to
   determine how to contact the receiving SSP.  To summarize the RFC
   3263 procedure: unless these are explicitly encoded in the target
   URI, a transport is chosen using NAPTR records, a port is chosen
   using SRV records, and an address is chosen using A or AAAA records.

   When communicating with another SSP, entities compliant to this
   document should select a TLS-protected transport for communication
   from the originating SSP to the receiving SSP if available.

5.1.2.2.  Routing Table

   If there are no End User ENUM records and the Originating SSP cannot
   discover the carrier-of-record or if the Originating SSP cannot reach
   the carrier-of-record via SIP peering, the Originating SSP may
   deliver the call to the PSTN or reject it.  Note that the originating
   SSP may forward the call to another SSP for PSTN gateway termination
   by prior arrangement using the routing table.

   If so, the originating SSP rewrites the Request-URI to address the
   gateway resource in the target SSP's domain and MAY forward the
   request on to that SSP using the procedures described in the
   remainder of these steps.

5.1.2.3.  LRF to LRF Routing

   Communications between the LRF of two interconnecting SSPs may use
   DNS or statically provisioned IP Addresses for reachability.  Other
   inputs to determine the path may be code-based routing, method-based
   routing, Time of day, least cost and/or source-based routing.

5.1.3.  The Signaling Path Border Element (SBE)

   The purpose of signaling function is to perform routing of SIP
   messages as well as optionally implement security and policies on SIP
   messages, and to assist in discovery/exchange of parameters to be

Internet-Draft       SPEERMINT Peering Architecture          August 2010


   used by the Media Function (MF).

   The signaling function performs the routing of SIP messages.  The
   optional termination and re-initiation of calls may be performed by
   the signaling path Session Border Element (SBE), or other signaling
   elements.

   Optionally, a SF may perform additional functions such as Session
   Admission Control, SIP Denial of Service protection, SIP Topology
   Hiding, SIP header normalization, SIP security, privacy, and
   encryption.

   The SF of a SBE can also process SDP payloads for media information
   such as media type, bandwidth, and type of codec; then, communicate
   this information to the media function.  Signaling function may
   optionally communicate with the network to pass Layer 3 related
   policies [10].

5.1.3.1.  Establishing a Trusted Relationship

   Depending on the security needs and trust relationships between SSPs,
   different security mechanism can be used to establish SIP calls.
   These are discussed in the following subsections.

5.1.3.2.  IPSec

   In certain deployments the use of IPSec between the signaling
   functions of the originating and terminating domains can be used as a
   security mechanism instead of TLS.

5.1.3.3.  Co-Location

   In this scenario the SFs are co-located in a physically secure
   location and/or are members of a segregated network.  In this case
   messages between the originating and terminating SSPs would be sent
   as clear text.

5.1.3.4.  Sending the SIP Request

   Once a trust relationship between the peers is established, the
   originating SSP sends the request.

5.2.  Target SSP Procedures

5.2.1.  The Ingress SBE

Internet-Draft       SPEERMINT Peering Architecture          August 2010


5.2.1.1.  TLS

   When the receiving SSP receives a TLS client hello, it responds with
   its certificate.  The Target SSP certificate should be valid and
   rooted in a well-known certificate authority.  The procedures to
   authenticate the SSP?s originating domain are specified in [24].

   The SF of the Target SSP verifies that the Identity header is valid,
   corresponds to the message, corresponds to the Identity-Info header,
   and that the domain in the From header corresponds to one of the
   domains in the TLS client certificate.

5.2.1.2.  Receive SIP Requests

   Once a trust relationship is established, the Target SSP is prepared
   to receive incoming SIP requests.  For new requests (dialog forming
   or not) the receiving SSP verifies if the target (request-URI) is a
   domain that for which it is responsible.  For these requests, there
   should be no remaining Route header field values.  For in-dialog
   requests, the receiving SSP can verify that it corresponds to the
   top-most Route header field value.

   The receiving SSP may reject incoming requests due to local policy.
   When a request is rejected because the originating SSP is not
   authorized to peer, the receiving SSP should respond with a 403
   response with the reason phrase "Unsupported Peer".

5.3.  Data Path Border Element (DBE)

   The purpose of the DBE [RFC 5486] is to perform media related
   functions such as media transcoding and media security implementation
   between two SSPs.

   An Example of this is to transform a voice payload from one codec
   (e.g., G.711) to another (e.g., EvRC).  Additionally, the MF may
   perform media relaying, media security, privacy, and encryption.


6.  Address Space Considerations

   Peering must occur in a common IP address space, which is defined by
   the federation, which may be entirely on the public Internet, or some
   private address space.  The origination or termination networks may
   or may not entirely be in the same address space.  If they are not,
   then a network address translation (NAT) or similar may be needed
   before the signaling or media is presented correctly to the
   federation.  The only requirement is that all associated entities
   across the peering interface are reachable.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


9.  Security Considerations

   In all cases, cryptographic-based security should be maintained as an
   optional requirement between peering providers conditioned on the
   presence or absence of underlying physical security of SSP
   connections, e.g. within the same secure physical building.

   In order to maintain a consistent approach, unique and specialized
   security requirements common for the majority of peering
   relationships, should be standardized within the IETF.  These
   standardized methods may enable capabilities such as dynamic peering
   relationships across publicly maintained interconnections.
