2.  Introduction

   apt-X, enhanced apt-X and apt-X Live are proprietary audio
   compression algorithms.  No prior RFC or standard has been used to
   describe how to packetise this audio data.  The compression algorithm
   yields a fixed bit rate scaled according to the sample frequency of
   the input audio.  The fixed rate is one quarter of the original bit
   rate.  This rule also applies to the resolution of the audio.
   Example, a 1.536MB/s stereo audio stream using 16 bit PCM is reduced
   to 384 kb/s.  The apt-X and enhanced apt-X algorithms can carry an
   ancillary data stream and synchronisation information within the
   compressed audio stream without additional overhead.  The ancillary
   data stream can be used to transport data or timecode data for
   synchronisation with video.  The bandwidth of the ancillary data
   channel is one quarter the sample frequency, example at Fs = 48kHz
   the ancillary data stream is 12 kb/s.  The similarities between the
   packetisation is such that it does each variant does not warrant a
   separate RFC.

3.  Encapsulation of apt-X and Enhanced apt-X Streams

   apt-X Live and Enhanced apt-X is a non framed based algorithm and
   produces as its output a sixteen bit word representing four sixteen
   bit PCM samples.  The packetisation of the data shall be on a byte by
   byte basis.  Packet size must be a multiple of the number of n x
   64kbps channels in the resultant bitrate.  For example a 384kbps
   channel would result in a multiple of 6.  Therefore the resultant
   payload size would be N x 6 bytes.  Likewise a 576kbps channel would
   require a payload N * 9 bytes.

3.1.  RTP header usage

   apt-X Live and Enhanced apt-X require no special considerations be
   placed in the RTP header.  The timestamp used in the RTP header shall
   comply with the same timestamp specified in RFC3550.  Payload Header
   (payload format dependent) Payload

        PT - Payload Type

        PS - Payload Structure

   The payload data for apt-X Live and Enhanced apt-X shall be
   delineated as Left channel data/ Right Channel data.  Data is word
   aligned big endian format.  For multi-channel packets the data is
   allocated as per the following rules.

        1) N bytes (LL/RR) format per channel

        2) N is defined by the number of N x 64kb/s channels present in
        the overall audio bit stream.

        3) Channels are paired for simplicity .i.e 12/34/56

   Multiple channels are grouped together for transmission to preserve
   phase between channels.

      Example 6.912 mb/s 5.1 Enhanced apt-X 24bit 3 * 576/64 = N = 9

      17..Channels 1/2....0 17..Channels 3/4....0 17...Channels 5/6...0

      For multi-channel distribution the format becomes,

      17..Channels L/R... 0 17..Channels Ls/Rs..0 17..Channels C/B... 0

5.  SDP Related Considerations

   The following paragraphs defines the mapping of the parameters
   described in the IANA considerations section and their usage in the
   Offer/Answer Model [RFC3264].

5.1.  Mapping Media Type Parameters into SDP

   The information carried in the Media Type media type specification
   has a specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) [RFC4566], that is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.
   When SDP is used to specify sessions the mapping are as follows:

   o    The type name ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o    The subtype name ("aptX") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the encoding
        name.

   o    The parameter "rate" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as clock rate.

   o    The parameter "channels" also goes in "a=rtpmap" as channel
        count.

   o    The optional parameter "audio-mode", "aux", "scale", when
        present, MUST be included in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute and MUST
        follow the delivery-method that applies.

5.2.  SDP Example

   The following example shows a basic SDP single stream.  The first
   configuration packet is inlined in the sdp, other configurations
   could be fetched at any time from the first provided uri using or all
   the known configuration could be downloaded using the second uri.

        c=IN IP4 192.0.2.x

        m=audio RTP/AVP 98

        a=rtpmap:98 aptX/44100/2

        a=fmtp:98 audio-mode=stereo; aux=auxoff;

   Note that the payload format (encoding) names are commonly shown in
   upper case.  Media subtypes are commonly shown in lower case.  These
   names are case-insensitive in both places.  Similarly, parameter
   names are case-insensitive both in media types and in the default
   mapping to the SDP a=fmtp attribute.

Internet-Draft       "RTP Payload Format for apt-X"           April 2008


5.3.  Usage with the SDP Offer/Answer Model

   The only parameter negotiable is the delivery method.  All the others
   are declarative: the offer, as described in An Offer/Answer Model
   Session Description Protocol offer answer model [RFC3264], may
   contain a large number of delivery methods per single fmtp attribute,
   the answerer MUST remove every delivery-method and configuration-uri
   not supported.  All the parameters MUST not be altered on answer
   otherwise.

7.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [2], and any appropriate RTP profile (for example
   [RFC3550]).  This implies that confidentiality of the media streams
   is achieved by encryption.  Because the data compression used with
   this payload format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be
   performed after compression so there is no conflict between the two
   operations.  A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data
   encodings using compression techniques that have non-uniform
   receiver-end computational load.  The attacker can inject
   pathological datagrams into the stream which are complex to decode
   and cause the receiver to be overloaded.  However, this encoding does
   not exhibit any significant non-uniformity.  As with any IP-based
   protocol, in some circumstances a receiver may be overloaded simply
   by the receipt of too many packets, either desired or undesired.
   Network-layer authentication may be used to discard packets from
   undesired sources, but the processing cost of the authentication
   itself may be too high.  In a multicast environment, pruning of
   specific sources may be implemented in future versions of IGMP
   [RFC3376] and in multicast routing protocols to allow a receiver to
   select which sources are allowed to reach it.
