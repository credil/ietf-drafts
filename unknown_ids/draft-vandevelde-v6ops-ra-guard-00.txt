Abstract

   When using IPv6 within a single L2 network segment it is assumed that
   for good network behavior, the available routers attached to the
   segment are valid routers.  A rogue Router Advertisement (RA) [1]
   however could be sent by accident by a misconfigured network device,
   or on purpose by malicious devices.  This document proposes a

   solution to reduce the threat of rogue RAs by enabling layer 2
   devices to provide forward RAs received over designated ports.

Internet-Draft                IPv6 RA-Guard                November 2007


1.  Introduction

   When operating IPv6 in a shared L2 network segment there is always
   the risk of facing operational problems due to rogue Router
   Advertisements generated malliciously or unintentionaly by
   unauthorized or improperly configured routers connecting to the
   segment.  If a network segment is designed around a single or a set
   of L2-switching devices capable of identifying invalid RAs and
   blocking them, then the impact of rogue RA's can be minimized.

   The identification of valid RA's can be done based on various
   criteria defined by the network administrator.

   Previous art to minimalize the impact of rogue RA's has been
   investigated by various people and entities.  Some examples of these
   studies are [2] [3] [4].


2.  RA-Guard state-machine

   RA-Guard runs on devices that provide connectivity between hosts and
   other hosts or networking devices.  An example of such RA-Guard
   capable device would be an OSI Layer-2 switch.  The capability can be
   enabled globally at device level or at interface level.

   Depending on the mode of operation, the state-machine of the RA-Guard
   capability consists of three different states:
      State 1: OFF
      State 2: LEARNING
      State 3: ACTIVE

   The transition between these states can be triggered by manual
   configuration or by meeting a pre-defined criteria.

2.1.  RA-Guard state: OFF

   A device or interface in RA-Guard "OFF" state, operates as if the RA-
   Guard capability is not available.

2.2.  RA-Guard state: LEARNING

   A device or interface in the RA-Guard "Learning" state is actively
   acquiring information about the devices connected to its interfaces.
   The learning process takes place over a pre-defined period of time by
   capturing router advertisments.  The information gathered is compared
   against pre-defined criteria which qualify the validity of the RAs.

   In this state, the RA-Guard enabled device or interface is either

   blocking all RAs until their validity is verified or, alternatively
   it can temporarily forward the RAs until the decision is being made.

2.3.  RA-Guard state: ACTIVE

   A device or interface running RA-Guard and in Active state will block
   ingress RA-messages deemed invalid and will forward those deemed
   valid based on a pre-defined criteria defined.


3.  RA-Guard interface states

   The interfaces of devices with the RA-guard capability enabled can be
   in three possible states related to RA handling: Learning, Blocking
   and Forwarding.

3.1.  RA-Blocking interface

   An interface in the RA Blocking state blocks all ingress RA messages
   when RA-Guard capability is activated on a device.

3.2.  RA-Forwarding interface

   An interface in the RA Forwarding state forwards all ingress RA
   messages deemed valid when RA-Guard capability is activated on a
   device.

3.3.  RA-Learning interface

   An interface in a RA Learning state all ingress RAs are snooped and
   compared against the criteria identifying valid RAs.  While in this
   state, the RAs can be blocked or forwarded until a decission is taken
   regarding their validity.

3.4.  RA-Guard interface state transition

   In the simplest cases, an RA-Guard enabled interface can be manually
   set in an RA-Blocking or RA-Forwarding state.  In the more general
   case, the interface acquires RA information during the RA Learning
   state and by using a pre-defined validity criteria decides whether
   the analyzed RAs should be forwarded or blocked.  Based on this
   decission, the interface transitions into the RA Blocking or the RA
   Forwarding state.

   Upon detecting new RAs, a port can transition back into an RA-Guard
   Learning state.

4.  Pittfals of RA-Guard

   The RA-Guard mechanism relies on the assumption that all mesages
   between IPv6 devices in the target environment traverse the
   controlled L2 networking devices.  When on a shared media such as an
   Ethernet hub, devices can communicate directly without going through
   an RA-Guard capable L2 networking device.  In this scenario, the RA-
   Guard feature has no additional value.

   RA-Guard mecahnism does not protect against tunneled IPv6 traffic.

   RA-Guard does not provide any protection against the content or IPv6
   addresses used with RA-messages.
