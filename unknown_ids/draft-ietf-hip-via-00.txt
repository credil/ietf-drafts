   routing.  The first extension allows implementing source routing in
   HIP.  That is, a host sending a HIP packet can define a set of hosts

   that the HIP packet should traverse.  The second extension allows a
   HIP packet to carry and record the list of hosts that forwarded it.

Internet-Draft       HIP Multi-hop Routing Extension        October 2009


1.  Introduction

   When HIP [RFC5201] is used in certain contexts (e.g., in a HIP BONE
   [I-D.ietf-hip-bone] overlay), hosts need the ability to perform
   source routing.  That is, a host needs the ability to send a HIP
   packet that will traverse a set of hosts before reaching its
   destination.  This document defines an extension that provides HIP
   with this functionality.

   Additionally, when HIP packets are routed through multiple hosts,
   some of these hosts (e.g., the destination host) need the ability to
   know the hosts a particular packet traversed.  This document defines
   another extension that provides HIP with this functionality.

   These two extensions enable multi-hop routing in HIP.  Before these
   extensions were specified, HIP only supported a single intermediate
   host (i.e., a rendezvous server [RFC5204]) between the source of a
   HIP packet and its destination.


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Definitions

   Destination list:  A list of HITs of the hosts that a HIP packet
      should traverse.

   Via list:  A list of HITs of the hosts that a HIP packet has
      traversed.

   Symmetric routing:  A response to a message is routed back using the
      same set of intermediary nodes as the original message used,
      except in reversed order.


3.  Protocol Definitions

3.1.  Creating and Processing Via Lists

   When a host sending a HIP packet needs to record the hosts that are
   on the path that the HIP packet traverses, it includes an empty
   ROUTE_VIA parameter to the packet.

Internet-Draft       HIP Multi-hop Routing Extension        October 2009


   A host that receives a packet with a ROUTE_VIA parameter SHOULD add
   its own HIT to the end of the ROUTE_VIA parameter, unless it is the
   receiver of the packet.  If the host uses a different HIT on the HIP
   association it used for receiving the packet than for sending it
   forward, it SHOULD also add the receiving HIT to the route list
   before the sending HIT.

   If the host is the receiver of the packet, and the received packet
   generates a response HIP packet, the host checks the SYMMETRIC flag
   from the ROUTE_VIA parameter.  If the SYMMETRIC flag is set, the host
   SHOULD create a ROUTE_DST parameter from the ROUTE_VIA parameter, as
   described in Section 3.2, and include it in the response packet.
   Also, if an intermediary host generates a new HIP packet (e.g., an
   error NOTIFY packet) due to a HIP packet that had a ROUTE_VIA
   parameter with SYMMETRIC flag set, and the new packet is intended for
   the sender of the original HIP packet, the host SHOULD construct and
   add a ROUTE_DST parameter into the new packet as in the previous
   case.

3.2.  Creating Destination Lists

   A host that needs to define the other hosts that should be on the
   path a HIP packet traverses adds a ROUTE_DST parameter to the HIP
   packet.  The host may either decide the path independently, or it may
   create the path based on a ROUTE_VIA parameter.  Only the originator
   of a signed HIP packet can add a ROUTE_DST parameter to the HIP
   packet since the parameter is covered by the signature.

   When a host creates a ROUTE_DST parameter due to receiving a packet
   with a ROUTE_VIA parameter, it copies all the HITs in the ROUTE_VIA
   parameter to the ROUTE_DST parameter, but in reversed order.  This
   results in HIP response packet being forwarded using the same set of
   hosts as the packet for which the response was generated for.

3.3.  Processing Destination Lists

   When a host receives a HIP packet that contains a ROUTE_DST
   parameter, it first looks up its own HIT from the route list.  If
   host's own HIT is not in the list and the host is not the receiver of
   the packet, the packet was incorrectly forwarded and MUST be dropped.
   Next hop for the packet is the HIT after host's own HIT in the list.
   If the host's HIT was the last HIT in the list, the next hop is the
   receiver's HIT in the HIP header.


4.  Packet Formats

   This memo defines two new HIP parameters that are used for recording

   a route via multiple hosts (ROUTE_VIA) and to define a route a packet
   should traverse by the sender of the packet (ROUTE_DST).

   The ROUTE_DST parameter is integrity protected with the signature
   (where present) but ROUTE_VIA is not so that intermediary hosts can
   add their own HITs to the list.  Both parameters have critical type
   (as defined in Section 5.2.1 of [RFC5201]) since the packet will not
   be properly routed unless all hosts on path recognize the parameters.

   most 32 HITs.  The Flags field is used for requesting special

   are shown in Table 1.  The Reserved field can be used by future

   this parameter.

   The "Pos" column in Table 1 shows the bit position of the flag (as in
   Figure 1) in the Flags field, "Name" gives the name of the flag used
   in this document, and "Purpose" gives brief description of the
   meaning of that flag.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This section is to be interpreted according to [RFC5226].

   This document updates the IANA Registry for HIP Parameter Types
   [RFC5201] by assigning new HIP Parameter Type values for the new HIP
   Parameters: ROUTE_VIA and ROUTE_DST (defined in Section 4).


6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Forwarding Loops

   A malicious host could craft a destination route list that contains
   the same HIT more than once and thus create a forwarding loop.  Since
   the IP layer TTL is decremented on each hop, the loop will be
   eventually broken, but hosts may additionally protect themselves
   against this attack by checking that their own HIT is in the
   destination list only once and drop invalid packets.
