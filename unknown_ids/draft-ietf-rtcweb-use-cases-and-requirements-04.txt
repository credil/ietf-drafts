Internet-Draft                   RTC-Web                  September 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document presents a few use-cases of web applications that are
   executed in a browser and use real-time communication capabilities.
   Based on the use-cases, the document derives requirements related to
   the browser and the API used by web applications in the browser.

   The requirements related to the browser are named "Fn" and are
   described in Section 5.2

   The requirements related to the API are named "An" and are described
   in Section 5.3

   The document focuses on requirements related to real-time media
   streams.  Requirements related to privacy, signalling between the
   browser and web server etc. are currently not considered.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions

   TBD


4.  Use-cases

4.1.  Introduction

   This section describes web based real-time communication use-cases,
   from which requirements are derived.

4.2.  Browser-to-browser use-cases

4.2.1.  Simple Video Communication Service

4.2.1.1.  Description

   In the service the users have loaded, and logged into, a video
   communication web application into their browsers, provided by the
   same service provider.  The web service publishes information about
   user login status, by pushing updates to the web application in the

   browsers.  By selecting an online peer user, a 1-1 video
   communication session between the browsers of the peers is initiated.
   The invited user might accept or reject the session.

   During session establishment a self-view is displayed, and once the
   session has been established the video sent from the remote peer is
   displayed displayed in addition to the self-view.  The users can
   during the session select to remove, and re-insert the self-view.
   The users can change the sizes of the video displays during the
   session.  The users can also pause sending of media (audio, video, or
   both), and mute incoming media.

   It is essential that the communication can not be eavesdropped.

   Any session participant can end the session at any time.

   The users are using communication devices of different makes, with
   different operating systems and browsers from different vendors.

   One user has an unreliable Internet connection.  It sometimes has
   packet losses, and is sometimes goes down completely.

   One user is located behind a Network Address Translator (NAT).

4.2.1.2.  Derived Requirements

   F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F8, F9, F10, F17, F22, F25

   A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13

4.2.2.  Simple Video Communication Service, NAT/FW that blocks UDP

4.2.2.1.  Description

   This use-case is almost identical to the previos one.  The difference
   is that one of the users is behind a NAT that blocks UDP traffic.

4.2.2.2.  Derived Requirements

   F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F8, F9, F10, F17, F22, F23, F25, F26

   A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13

4.2.3.  Simple Video Communication Service, access change

Internet-Draft                   RTC-Web                  September 2011


4.2.3.1.  Description

   This use-case is almost identical to "4.2.1 Simple Video
   Communication Service".  The difference is that the user changes
   network access during the session:

   The communication device used by one of the users have several
   network adapters (Ethernet, WiFi, Cellular).  The communication
   device is access the Internet using Ethernet, but the user has to
   start a trip during the session.  The communication device
   automatically changes to use WiFi when the Ethernet cable is removed
   and then moves to cellular access to the Internet when moving out of
   WiFi coverage.  The session continues even though the access method
   changes.

4.2.3.2.  Derived Requirements

   A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13

4.2.4.  Simple Video Communication Service, QoS

4.2.4.1.  Description

   This use-case is almost identical to the previos one.  The use of QoS
   capabilities is added:

   The user in the previous use case that starts a trip is behind a
   common residential router that supports prioritization of traffic.
   In addition, the user's provider of cellular access has QoS support
   enabled.  The user is able to take advantage of the QoS support both
   when accessing via the residential router and when using cellular.

4.2.4.2.  Derived Requirements

   F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F8, F9, F10, F17, F21, F22, F23, F25

   A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13

4.2.5.  Simple video communication service with inter-operator calling

4.2.5.1.  Description

   Two users have logged into two different web applications, provided
   by different service providers.

   The service providers are interconnected by some means, but exchange

   no more information about the users than what can be carried using
   SIP.

   NOTE: More profiling of what this means may be needed.

   Each web service publishes information about user login status for
   users that have a relationship with the other user; how this is
   established is out of scope.

   The same functionality as in the "4.2.1 Simple Video Communication
   Service" is available.

   The same issues with connectivity apply.

4.2.6.  Hockey Game Viewer

4.2.6.1.  Description

   An ice-hockey club uses an application that enables talent scouts to,
   in real-time, show and discuss games and players with the club
   manager.  The talent scouts use a mobile phone with two cameras, one
   front facing and one rear facing.

   The club manager uses a desktop, equipped with one camera, for
   viewing the game and discussing with the talent scout.

   Before the game starts, and during game breaks, the talent scout and
   the manager have a 1-1 video communication.  Only the rear facing
   camera of the mobile phone is used.  On the display of the mobile
   phone, the video of the club manager is shown with a picture-in-
   picture thumbnail of the rear facing camera (self-view).  On the
   display of the desktop, the video of the talent scout is shown with a
   picture-in-picture thumbnail ot the desktop camera (self-view).

   When the game is on-going, the talent scout activates the use of the
   front facing camera, and that stream is sent to the desktop (the
   stream from the rear facing camera continues to be sent all the
   time).  The video stream captured by the front facing camera (that is
   capturing the game) of the mobile phone is shown in a big window on
   the desktop screen, with picture-in-picture thumbnails of the rear
   facing camera and the desktop camera (self-view).  On the display of
   the mobile phone the game is shown (front facing camera) with

   picture-in-picture thumbnails of the rear facing camera (self-view)
   and the desktop camera.

   It is essential that the communication can not be eavesdropped.

4.2.7.  Multiparty video communication

4.2.7.1.  Description

   In this use-case the simple video communication service is extended
   by allowing multiparty sessions.  No central server is involved - the
   browser of each participant sends and receives streams to and from
   all other session participants.  The web application in the browser
   of each user is responsible for setting up streams to all receivers.

   In order to enhance intelligibility, the web application pans the
   audio from different participants differently when rendering the
   audio.  This is done automatically, but users can change how the
   different participants are placed in the (virtual) room.

   Each video stream received is by default displayed in a thumbnail
   frame within the browser, but users can change the display size.

   It is essential that the communication can not be eavesdropped.

   Note: What this use-case adds in terms of requirements is
   capabilities to send streams to and receive streams from several
   peers concurrently, as well as the capabilities to render the video
   from all recevied streams and be able to spatialize and mix the audio
   from all received streams locally in the browser.

4.2.8.1.  Description

   In this use-case, the voice part of the multiparty video
   communication application is used in the context of an on-line game.
   The received voice audio media is rendered together with game sound
   objects.  For example, the sound of a tank moving from left to right
   over the screen must be rendered and played to the user together with
   the voice media.

   Quick updates of the game state is required.

   It is essential that the communication can not be eavesdropped.

   Note: the difference regarding local audio processing compared to the
   "Multiparty video communication" use-case is that other sound objects
   than the streams must be possible to be included in the
   spatialization and mixing.  "Other sound objects" could for example
   be a file with the sound of the tank, that file could be stored
   locally or remotely.

4.2.9.  Distributed Music Band

4.2.9.1.  Description

   In this use-case, a music band is playing music while the members are
   at different physical locations.  No central server is used, instead
   all streams are set up in a mesh fashion.

   Discussion: This use-case was briefly discussed at the Quebec webrtc
   meeting and it got support.  So far the only concrete requirement
   (A17) derived is that the application must be able to ask the browser
   to treat the audio signal as audio (in contrast to speech).  However,
   the use case should be further analysed to determine other
   requirements (could be e.g. on delay mic->speaker, level control of
   audio signals, etc.).

4.3.  Browser - GW/Server use cases

4.3.1.  Telephony terminal

4.3.1.1.  Description

   A mobile telephony operator allows its customers to use a web browser
   to access their services.  After a simple log in the user can place
   and receive calls in the same way as when using a normal mobile
   phone.  When a call is received or placed, the identity is shown in
   the same manner as when a mobile phone used.

   It is essential that the communication can not be eavesdropped.

4.3.2.  Fedex Call

4.3.2.1.  Description

   Alice uses her web browser with a service something like Skype to be
   able to phone PSTN numbers.  Alice calls 1-800-gofedex.  Alice should
   be able to hear the initial prompts from the fedex IVR and when the
   IVR says press 1, there should be a way for Alice to navigate the
   IVR.

4.3.3.  Video conferencing system with central server

4.3.3.1.  Description

   An organization uses a video communication system that supports the
   establishment of multiparty video sessions using a central conference
   server.

   The browsers of each participant send an audio stream (type in terms
   of mono, stereo, 5.1, ... depending on the equipment of the
   participant) to the central server.  The central server mixes the
   audio streams (and can in the mixing process naturally add effects

   such as spatialization) and sends towards each participant a mixed
   audio stream which is played to the user.

   The browser of each participant sends video towards the server.  For
   each participant one high resolution video is displayed in a large
   window, while a number of low resolution videos are displayed in
   smaller windows.  The server selects what video streams to be
   forwarded as main- and thumbnail videos respectively, based on speech
   activity.  As the video streams to display can change quite
   frequently (as the conversation flows) it is important that the delay
   from when a video stream is selected for display until the video can
   be displayed is short.

   The organization has an internal network set up with an aggressive
   firewall handling access to the Internet.  If users can not
   physically access the internal network, they can establish a Virtual
   Private Network (VPN).

   It is essential that the communication can not be eavesdropped.

   All participant are authenticated by the central server, and
   authorized to connect to the central server.  The participants are
   identified to each other by the central server, and the participants
   do not have access to each others' credentials such as e-mail
   addresses or login IDs.

   Note: This use-case adds requirements on support for fast stream
   switches F7, on encryption of media and on ability to traverse very
   restrictive FWs.  There exists several solutions that enable the
   server to forward one high resolution and several low resolution
   video streams: a) each browser could send a high resolution, but
   scalable stream, and the server could send just the base layer for
   the low resolution streams, b) each browser could in a simulcast
   fashion send one high resolution and one low resolution stream, the
   server just selects, c) each browser sends just an high resolution
   stream, the server trancodes into low reslution streams as required.

5.1.  General

   This section contains the requirements derived from the use-cases in
   section 4.

   NOTE: It is assumed that the user applications are executed on a
   browser.  Whether the capabilities to implement specific browser
   requirements are implemented by the browser application, or are
   provided to the browser application by the underlying operating
   system, is outside the scope of this document.

                   audio and video even in presence of reasonable
                   levels of jitter and packet losses.

                   TBD: What is a reasonable level?
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F6              The browser MUST be able to handle high loss and
                   jitter levels in a graceful way.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F8              The browser MUST detect when a stream from a
                   peer is not received any more
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F9              When there are both incoming and outgoing audio
                   streams, echo cancellation MUST be made available to
                   avoid disturbing echo during conversation.

5.3.  API requirements


   REQ-ID          DESCRIPTION
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A1              The web application MUST be able to ask the
                   browser for permission to use cameras
                   and microphones as input devices.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A2              The web application MUST be able to control how
                   streams generated by input devices are used.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A3              The web application MUST be able to control the
                   local rendering of streams (locally generated streams
                   and streams received from a peer).
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A4              The web application MUST be able to initiate
                   sending of stream/stream components to a peer.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A5              The web application MUST be able to control the
                   media format (codec) to be used for the streams
                   sent to a peer.

                   NOTE: The level of control depends on whether
                   the codec negotiation is handled by the browser
                   or the web application.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A6              After a media stream has been established, the
                   web application MUST be able to modify the media
                   format for streams sent to a peer.

   A7              The web application MUST be made aware of
                   whether the establishment of a stream with a

                   a stream received from a peer.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A10             The web application MUST be able to cease the
                   sending of a stream to a peer.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A11             The web application MUST be able to cease
                   processing and rendering of a stream received
                   from a peer.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A12             The web application MUST be informed when a
                   stream from a peer is no longer received.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A13             The web application MUST be informed when high
                   loss rates occur.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A14             It MUST be possible for the web application to
                   control panning, mixing and other processing for
                   individual streams.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A15             The Web application must be provided with an
                   identifier for the stream that can be communicated
                   to the other party of the communication, and which
                   the other party can associate with its end of the
                   same stream.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A16             It MUST be possible for the web application to
                   send and receive datagrams to/from peer
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A17             It MUST be possible for the web application to
                   indicate the type of audio signal (speech, audio)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A18             It must be possible for an initiator or a
                   responder Web application to indicate the types
                   of media he's willing to accept incoming streams
                   for when setting up a connection (audio, video,
                   other). The types of media he's willing to accept
                   can be a subset of the types of media the browser
                   is able to accept.

6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD


7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Introduction

   A malicious web application might use the browser to perform Denial
   Of Service (DOS) attacks on NAT infrastructure, or on peer devices.
   Also, a malicious web application might silently establish outgoing,
   and accept incoming, streams on an already established connection.

   Based on the identified security risks, this section will describe
   security considerations for the browser and web application.

7.2.  Browser Considerations

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms for getting user
   consent to use device resources such as camera and microphone.

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms for informing the user
   that device resources such as camera and microphone are in use
   ("hot").

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms for users to revise
   consent to use device resources such as camera and microphone.

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms in order to assure that
   streams are the ones the recipient intended to receive.

   The browser is needs to ensure that media is not sent, and that
   received media is not rendered, until the associated stream
   establishment and handshake procedures with the remote peer have been
   successfully finished.

   The browser needs to ensure that the stream negotiation procedures
   are not seen as Denial Of Service (DOS) by other entities.

7.3.  Web Application Considerations

   The web application is expected to ensure user consent in sending and
   receiving media streams.

8.  Additional use-cases

   Several additional use-cases have been discussed.  At this point
   these use-cases are not included as requirement deriving use-cases
   for different reasons (lack of documentation, overlap with existing
   use-cases, lack of consensus).  For completeness these additional
   use-cases are listed below:
   1.   Use-cases regarding different situations when being invited to a
        "session", e.g. browser open, browser open but another tab
        active, browser open but active in session, browser closed, ....
        (Matthew Kaufman); discussed at webrtc meeting
   2.   Different TURN provider scenarios (Cullen Jennings); discussed
        at the webrtc meeting

        rtcweb/current/msg00525.html, followed up by Stephan Wenger
   4.   Local Recording and Remote recording (John): Discussed a _lot_
        on the mail lists (rtcweb as well as public-webrtc) late August
        2011.  Not concluded at time of writing.
   5.   Emergency access for disabled (Bernard Aboba) http://
        www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/rtcweb/current/msg00478.html
   6.   Clue use-cases (Roni Even) http://tools.ietf.org/html/

        mail-archive/web/rtcweb/current/msg00323.html
   8.   Remote assistance (ala VNC or RDP) - User is helping another
        user on their computer with either view-only or view-with-
        control, either of just the browser of the the entire screen. ht
