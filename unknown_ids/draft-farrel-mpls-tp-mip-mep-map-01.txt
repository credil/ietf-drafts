1. Introduction

   The Framework for Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
   within the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) (the MPLS-TP OAM
   Framework, [OAM-FWK]) describes how Maintenance Intermediate Points
   (MIPs) may be situated within network nodes at the incoming and
   outgoing interfaces.

   In-band OAM messages are sent using the Generic Associated Channel
   (G-ACh) [RFC5586]. OAM messages for the transit points of pseudowires
   (PWs) or Label Switched Paths (LSPs) are delivered using the
   expiration of the MPLS shim header time-to-libe (TTL) field. OAM
   messages for the end points of PWs and LSPs are simply delivered as
   normal.

   OAM messages delivered to end points or transit points are
   distinguished from other (data) packets so that they can be processed
   as OAM. In LSPs, the mechanism used is the presence of the Generic
   Associated Channel Label (GAL) in the Label Stack Entry (LSE) under
   the top LSE [RFC5586]. In PWs, the mechanism used is the presence of
   the PW Associated Channel Header (PWACH) [RFC4385].

   These mecahnisms means that all OAM messages intended for any MIP on
   a node are delivered to the MIP at the incoming interface.

   This document describes a way of forming OAM messages so that they
   can be targeted at incoming MIPs and outgoing MIPs, forwarded

2. Summary of Problem Statement

   Figure 1 shows an abstract functional representation of an MPLS-TP
   node. It is decomposed as an incoming interface, a cross-connect
   (XC), and an outgoing interface. As per the discussion in
   [OAM-FWK], MIPs may be placed in each of the functional interface
   components.

   Several distinct OAM functions are required within this architectural
   model:

   - OAM loopback at a MIP
   - data loopback at a MIP
   - OAM control at a MIP
   - measurement at a MIP

   The MIPs in these OAM functions may equally be the MIPs at the input
   or output interfaces.

   In-band OAM messages are sent using the G-ACh [RFC5586]. OAM messages
   for the transit points of PWs or LSPs are delivered using the
   expiration of the time-to-live (TTL) field in the top LSE of the MPLS
   packet header. OAM messages for the end points of PWs and LSPs are
   simply delivered as normal.

   OAM messages delivered to end points or transit points are
   distinguished from other (data) packets so that they can be processed
   as OAM. In LSPs, the mechanism used is the presence of the Generic
   Associated Channel Label (GAL) in the LSE under the top LSE
   [RFC5586]. In PWs, the mechanism used is the presence of the PW
   Associated Channel Header [RFC4385].

   Any solution for sending OAM to the in and out MIPs must fit within
   this existing model of handling OAM.

   Additionally, many MPLS-TP nodes contain an optimization such that
   all queuing and forwarding function is performed at the incoming
   interface. The abstract functional representation of such a node is
   shown in Figure 2. As shown in the figure, the outgoing interfaces
   are minimal and for this reason it may not be possible to include MIP
   function on those interfaces. This is particularly the case for
   existing deployed implementations.

   Any solution that attempts to send OAM to the outgoing interface of
   an MPLS-TP node must not cause any problems when such implementations
   are present.

   Lastly, OAM must operate on MPLS-TP nodes that are branch points on
   point-to-multipoint (P2MP) trees. That means that it must possible to
   target individual outgoing MIPs as well as all outgoing MIPs in the
   abstract functional representation shown in Figure 3, as well as to
   handle the optimized P2MP node as shown in Figure 4.

   In summary, the solution for OAM message delivery must support the
   following features:

   - Forwarding of OAM packets exactly as data packets.
   - Delivery of OAM messages to the correct MPLS-TP node.
   - Direction of OAM instructions to the correct MIP within an MPLS-TP
     node.
   - Packet inspection at the incoming and outgoing interfaces must be
     minimized.

   Note that although this issue appears superficially to be an
   implementation matter local to an individual node, the format of the
   message needs to be standardised so that:

   - An upstream MEP can correctly target the outgoing MIP of a specific
     MPLS-TP node.
   - A downstream node can correctly filter out any OAM messages that
     were intended for its upstream neighbor's outgoing MIP, but which
     were not handled there because the upstream neighbor is an
     optimized implementation.

2.1. Rejected Partial Solution

   A reject solution is depicted in Figure 5. All data and non-local OAM
   is handled as normal. Local OAM is intercepted at the incoming
   interface and delivered to the MIP at the incoming interface. If the
   OAM is intended for the incoming MIP it is handled there with no
   issues. If the OAM is intended for the outgoing MIP it is forwarded
   to that MIP using some internal messaging system that is
   implementation-specific.

   This solution is fully functional for the incoming MIP. It also
   supports control of data loopback for the outgoing MIP, and can
   adequately perform some OAM features such as interface identity
   reporting at the outgoing MIP.

   However, because the the OAM message is not forwarded through the
   switch fabric, this solution cannot correctly perform OAM loopback,
   connectivity verification, LSP tracing, or performance measurement.

3. Proposed Solution

   Figure 6 shows a proposed message format for handling the different
   cases described in Section 2. The subsections that follow describe
   the processing rules for each case.

   Note that this proposed solution requires a packet to be sent with
   TTL=0. An alternative approach is described in Section 4.

Internet-Draft            Internal MIP Handling            February 2010


3.1. Processing of Data and Non-Local OAM

   The message formats and processing rules for data and non-local OAM
   are not changed by this proposal.

   The top-of-stack label is swapped and the top-of-stack TTL is
   decremented.

3.2. Processing of In-MIP OAM

   The message formats and processing rules for in-MIP OAM are not
   changed by this proposal.

3.2.1. LSP Processing

   The top-of-stack TTL is decremented and expires. The packet is
   examined further and the GAL is discovered. The TTL of the GAL LSE is
   1 indicating that the packet is intended for inspection at the
   incoming interface. Further inspection of the packet the Associcated
   Channel Header (ACH) type indicating that the packet is OAM, and the
   packet is delivered to the in-MIP.

   Note that an ACH TLV could be included to identify the in-MIP (as in
   Section 3.3), but this is not required since the absence of such a
   TLV could be inferred to indicate the in-MIP as the target (thus
   achieving backward compatibility with existing in-MIP-only systems).

3.2.2. PW Processing

   The top-of-stack TTL is decremented and expires. The S bit [RFC3032]
   is found to be set, and the next nibble is examined. This shows that
   a PWACH is present. The Channel Type field of the PWACH [RFC4385]
   indicates that the packet is OAM, and the packet is delivered to the
   in-MIP.

   Note that an ACH TLV could be included to identify the in-MIP (as in
   Section 3.3), but this is not required since the absence of such a
   TLV could be inferred to indicate the in-MIP as the target (thus
   achieving backward compatibility with existing in-MIP-only systems).

3.3. Processing of Out-MIP OAM

   OAM messages intended for the out-MIP on a node are initially
   intercepted as described in Section 3.2. That is the TTL expires and
   further inspection of the packet indicates that it is OAM.

   The incoming interface must forward the OAM message through the
   switch fabric as if it was data. So, the packet is passed on

Internet-Draft            Internal MIP Handling            February 2010


   unchanged except that the TTL has been decremented and expired.

3.3.1. LSP Processing

   When the top-of-stack TTL expires (i.e., is decremented to zero) the
   next label is inspected and found to be the GAL. The TTL of the GAL
   LSE is 2 (i.e., not equal to 1) indicating that the packet is not
   intended for further inspection at the incoming interface. The packet
   is forwarded in the data plane.

   If the outgoing interface is capable of packet inspection, the top-
   level TTL is found to be zero and the packet is removed from the data
   stream (i.e., not sent). The TTL in the GAL LSE shows the value 2
   indicating that the packet is for the out-MIP, and the ACH type
   confirms that the packet is OAM.

   Note that an ACH TLV could be included to identify the out-MIP (and
   this becomes a requirement for P2MP LSPs as described in Section
   3.4).

   If the outgoing interface is not capable of packet inspection the
   packet will be forwarded out of the outgoing interface. See Section
   3.5 for more details.

3.3.2. PW Processing

   When the top-of-stack TTL expires and the PWACH is found, the Channel
   Type shows that the packet is OAM. An ACH TLV is required to indicate
   that the out-MIP is the target. The packet is forwarded in the data
   plane.

   If the outgoing interface is capable of packet inspection, the top-
   level TTL is found to be zero and the packet is removed from the data
   stream (i.e., not sent). The PWACH indicates that the packet is OAM,
   and the ACH TLV indicates that the out-MIP is the target.

   If the outgoing interface is not capable of packet inspection the
   packet will be forwarded out of the outgoing interface. See Section
   3.5 for more details.

3.4. Processing at P2MP Branch Nodes

   At P2MP branch nodes, the OAM messages may be targeted at one or all
   outgoing interfaces. It should be noted that packet replication is a

   function of the switch fabric so that any OAM message forwarded by
   the incoming interface will be passed to all outgoing interfaces.
   The procedures operate as described in section 3.3 and ACH TLVs are

Internet-Draft            Internal MIP Handling            February 2010


   required to limit the OAM to one or more out-MIPs.

3.4.1. LSP Processing

   The outgoing interfaces are able to determine whether the OAM message
   is intended for the local out-MIP by examining a MIP identifier
   carried in an ACH TLV. More than one MIP identifier can be included
   to allow multiple out-MIPs on the same P2MP tree to be targeted by
   the same OAM message.

   A special MIP identifier number is used to indicate that all out-MIPs
   on the P2MP PW are targets. This identifier must include an
   identifier that is unique to the local node.

   An OAM message received at an outgoing interface for a P2MP LSP but
   not including any ACH TLVs to indicate the out-MIPs, should be
   sliently discarded.

   OAM messages received at outgoing interfaces that support out-MIP
   OAM, but not intended for the local MIP are silently dropped.

   If the outgoing interface is not capable of packet inspection the
   packet will be forwarded out of the outgoing interface. See Section
   3.5 for more details.

3.4.2. PW Processing

   The outgoing interfaces are able to determine whether the OAM message
   is intended for the local out-MIP by examining a MIP identifier
   carried in an ACH TLV. More than one MIP identifier can be included
   to allow multiple out-MIPs on the same P2MP tree to be targeted by
   the same OAM message. As described in Section 3.3.2, such ACH TLVs
   are required for any out-MIP processing.

   A special MIP identifier number is used to indicate that all out-MIPs
   on the P2MP PW are targets. This identifier must include an
   identifier that is unique to the local node.


   OAM messages received at outgoing interfaces that support out-MIP
   OAM, but not intended for the local MIP are silently dropped.

   If the outgoing interface is not capable of packet inspection the
   packet will be forwarded out of the outgoing interface. See Section
   3.5 for more details.

Internet-Draft            Internal MIP Handling            February 2010


3.5. Processing When There is No Out-MIP

   When there is no out-MIP supported on an optimized switch
   implementation there are two options.

   1. The OAM message is intercepted at the incoming interface as
      described in Section 3.3, but the incoming interface is aware that
      it forms part of an optimized implementation that does not support
      an out-MIP. It can discard the received OAM message, or respond to
      indicate that the out-MIP is not supported.

   2. The OAM message is intercepted and forwarded as described in
      Section 3.3. Since there is no out-MIP, the message is forwarded
      out of the outgoing interface to the next downstream MPLS-TP node
      as shown at the bottom of Figures 6and 7. This means that the
      packet will be received at the downstream node carrying a TTL that
      has already expired (before it is decremented at the downstream
      node) indicating that the packet should be silently discarded.

      If the packet is examined in this case, it will reveal an ACH TLV
      identifying a MIP that is not local to the downstream node. This
      will result in the packet being dropped or a negative response
      being sent.

4. Enhanced Proposed Solution

   The mechanisms described in Section 3 can be enhanced by the use of a
   new reserved label, the Outgoing Mip Lable (OML). This label is
   substituted for the GAL when an OAM message intended for an outgoing
   MIP is processed at an incoming interface as shown in Figure 8.

   The advantage of this mechanism is that the outgoing interface of the
   local node and the incoming interface of the downstream node have
   someting more substantial to check than just the TTL value being
   zero. In fact, it allows the mesage to be sent with TTL of one so
   that the rules for sending packets with zero TTL are not compromised.

   The disadvantage is that a further reserved label is used.

   Note that an option is to allocate the OML as a purely local matter.

   That means that the implementation allocates the value of the OML
   from its local label space and assigns the meaning as described. This
   approach, however, would be risky if the packet escaped and was
   processed by the downstream node.

5. Security Considerations

   OAM security is discussed in [OAM-FWK] and [OAM-SEC].

   OAM can provide useful information for detecting and tracing security
   attacks.

   OAM can also be used to illicitly gather information or for denial of
   service attacks. Implementations are required to offer security
   mechanisms for OAM. Deployments are strongly advised to use suh
   mechanisms.

6. IANA Considerations

   This revision of this document does not make any requests of IANA.

   If the solution described in Section 4 is adopted, a request will be
   made to IANA for the allocation of a new reserved label.
