             To Address the Space Limitation of Inner VLAN
                draft-zhang-trill-vlan-extension-00.txt

Abstract

   TRILL is originally designed for customer networks. When it is used
   as a provider network to interconnect multiple separate users, the
   space of current Inner VLAN becomes insufficient. As an easy way, we
   can introduce a new VLAN ID field to TRILL header. The new VLAN ID
   can be use in conjunction with the native Inner VLAN, which is
   usually known as stacked VLANs(or Q-in-Q). The stacked VLANs
   mechanism is analyzed in this document. In addition, a novel MAC
   address rewriting mechanism is also brought forward to break the
   space limitation of the Inner VLAN. The MAC addresses of the native
   frame are not used for forwarding process in transit RBridges. When
   the packet enters the TRILL network, the ingress RBridge (Appointed
   Forwarder) uses a Virtual MAC (VMAC) address to replace the real MAC
   and embedded the native VLAN ID into this virtual MAC address. When a
   packet egresses from the TRILL network, the egress RBridge will use
   the real MAC address to replace the virtual MAC address and deliver
   it to the destination on the local link.

1. Introduction

   When multiple independent users run their own VLANs on the same TRILL
   network, TRILL has to configure one VLAN for each customer. However,
   the single Inner VLAN tag of TRILL can only identify 4094 VLANs which
   is not enough for multi-tenant scenarios. 

   To address this scalability issue, the first way that comes to our
   mind is to add a new VLAN tag to TRILL header. The newly added VLAN
   tag and the original Inner VLAN tag forms the stacked VLANs (Q-in-Q)
   which are widely used in provider bridging networks. The length of
   headers will surely increases which reduce the utilization of
   communication channel. Most important, RBridges have to be upgraded
   to support the new trill header. The MAC rewriting technique analyzed
   in this draft is another good choice for TRILL to break the above
   limitation.

   Traditional switches use the destination MAC address to look up the
   outgoing interface to the next hop. RBridges work in a different way.
   The MAC addresses are not used when transit RBridges are forwarding
   the frames across the TRILL network. In the MAC address rewriting
   method, a ingress RBridge writes the original VLAN tag into the MAC
   address field of the original frame; the egress RBridge write the MAC
   address back and deliver the packet to its destination host. The
   formerly Inner VLAN defined by TRILL will be used as the second VLAN
   tag in the stacked VLAN tags. This method does not change the header
   of TRILL and the transit RBridges need not be upgraded to support a
   provider network for multiple tenants environment. 

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. QinQ Mechanism

   To push a new VLAN tag besides the Inner VLAN to current TRILL data
   to realize QinQ mechanism. There will be 4094 * 4094 =16,760,836
   VLANs, which is enough for a provider network to separate its
   customer VLANs.

   pros: A. simple but powerful for services segregation; B. widely used
   by traditional bridged networks therefore easily be accepted

   con: A. need to change the definition of TRILL header therefore
   RBridge ASIC need to be change and/or software need to be upgrade; B.
   the length of TRILL data packets becomes longer; C. other cons of Q-

   in-Q mechanism



3. MAC Rewriting

   When a native frame enters a TRILL network, its MAC addresses will be
   rewritten by the ingress RBridges to include the VLAN ID of the
   native frame. The rewritten MAC becomes a virtual MAC address which
   is dubbed as VMAC in this document. When a TRILL data frame with VMAC
   egresses from the TRILL network, the VMAC is mapped back to its real
   MAC by the egress RBridge who will find its destination on the local
   link. The destination host will learn this rewritten VMAC address and
   used it for future layer2 data forwarding destined to this sender.

   The ARP query for a IP address to a real MAC address mapping now
   becomes the IP address to a VMAC address mapping. This mechanism
   avoid the upgrade of TRILL protocol. The ASIC of RBridges need not be
   changed. Only the configuration need to be done at the edge RBridges
   to realize the mapping.

   There two possible ways to do the mapping between MAC and VMAC at the
   edge of TRILL networks:
   A. sequentially numbering the hosts according to its bootstrapping
   time, set up a mapping database;
   B. a hash of the hosts' original MAC address, e.g., directly use the
   lower 3 bytes to fill in the lower 3 bytes of VMAC

   The bootstrapping becomes different:
   Previously: Bootstrapping means store the attached host's MAC;
   Now: Bootstrapping means two steps: 1. Assign a VMAC to the real MAC
   of the host. 2. store the attached host's VMAC

3.1. Protocol Extension

   A 24-bit Raw VLAN ID field is used to break the VLAN space limitation
   in TRILL networks. This field is named as Native VLAN ID field. The
   Inner VLAN ID originally defined by TRILL will be used us the second
   VLAN ID in the stacked VLANs mechanism.

   It is recommended that 3 bytes are used for native VLAN IDs and 3
   bytes are used for host identification. This partition can be tuned
   if necessary.

   Of course, the above egress RBridge has already announced the VMAC to
   the above ingress RBridge before hand. Therefore the ingress RBridge
   will directly use the announced VMAC to forwarding the frame. In
   fact, the ingress RBridge does not know the real MAC or the
   destination host, since ARP will translate IP to VMAC instead the
   real MAC. 

   Suppose the source MAC address of a is MAC_a. Host a looks up the ARP
   cache and find that MAC address of the destination is VMAC_b. The
   frame will be send to RB1 which is a's ingress RBridge. RB1 will
   replace the Inner.MacSA with VMAC_a according to its local mapping
   system. This Inner.MacSA will finally be learned by RB2 which is the
   egress RBridge. When RB2 receives the frame with VMACs, the VMAC_b
   will be replace with MAC_b which is the real MAC address of host b. 

   Before the above whole procedure, the VMAC_b has already been
   announced to host a and stored in its ARP cache. 

   By default, for unicast packets, the VLAN ID in the source VAMC and
   the Destination VMAC should be the same.

               Figure 3.3: A broadcast packet forwarding

   Sometimes, a host need to send out broadcast frames, such as ARP
   query messages and ARP miss frames. The Inner.MacDA of broadcast
   frames are FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF. In Figure 2.2, the broadcast process is
   depicted. This Inner.MacDA will be replaced with 20001:FF-FF-FF and
   will be multicasted across the TRILL network according to the base
   protocol of TRILL [TRILLbase]. Suppose Inner.MacSA is EE-EE-EE-EE-EE-
   01. It will be replaced with 20001:EE-EE-01 at the ingress RBridge.
   Host b will learn host a's VMAC (20001:EE-EE-01) when it receives
   this broadcast frame and insert it into its ARP cache.

            Figure 3.4: A unknown unicast packet forwarding

   For unknown unicast frame, the forwarding process is the same as
   known unicast only that RB1 has to multicast the unknown frame on to
   the TRILL network. Suppose host b is bootstrapped to RBx. RBx will
   finally egress the unknown unicast frame.

4. Deployment Issues

   The edge RBridges need to do mapping between original MAC and VMAC.
   The transit RBridges do not need to process the VMAC field.

4.1. Incremental Deployment

   Gracefully backward compatible to the traditional TRILL.

5. Scenarios

5.1. Mobility Support

   When a host is moved to another port of RBridge or moved to a port of
   another RBridge, the VMAC used for layer2 data forwarding is changed
   since the new home RBridge may assign a different VMAC for this host.
   The black-hole issue is now replaced with an ARP outdated issue.

   There are several ways to solve this problem:

   1. host immediately sends out gratuitous ARP to bootstrap to the new
   home RBridge;
   2. New home RBridge notify the old home RBridge the the new VMAC and
   old home RBridge redirect the frame to the new home RBridge;
   3. old home RBridge send the frame as unknown unicast frame;
   4. To use keep alive mechanism

   Fore the third method, if the host has moved to another position, the
   home RBridge will send out the received packets to this host as
   unknown unicast packets with the VMAC be replaced with broadcast MAC.
   This action continues until this home switch received the new
   location of the moved host. This mapping will be send out when the
   moved host finished the bootstrapping after movement. This can be
   achieved through gratuitous ARP. Gratuitous ARP is restricted in the
   local link. The new home switch will send out this mapping to outdate
   the old home switch. It can spread this bootstrapping information
   using TRILL ESADI mechanism.

   The sender can outdate the old  mapping between IP and VMAC in its
   ARP cache when he receives the broadcast packet or to directly
   replace the old mapping when he receives the ESADI.
