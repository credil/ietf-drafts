Internet-Draft        Reserved Top Level DNS Names             June 2008


1.  Introduction

   The global Internet Domain Name System is documented in [RFC1034],
   [RFC1035], [RFC1123], [RFC1591], and numerous additional Requests for
   Comments.  It defines a tree of names starting with root, ".",
   immediately below which are top level domain names such as ".com" and
   ".us".  Below top level domain names there are normally additional
   levels of names.

   IPv4 addresses used for tests and in examples are specified in
   [I-D.iana-rfc3330bis], IPv6 addresses used in examples are described
   in [RFC3849]; see also [RFC4085].

   Fully Qualified Domain Names used in many Internet Protocols allow
   only LDH (letter, digit, hyphen) domain labels as described in
   [RFC1123] and [RFC4343].  The letters are ASCII letters; LDH-labels
   are also known as A-labels in the context of IDN
   (Internationalization of Domain Names) and [IDNAbis].

   The key words "MAY", "RECOMMENDED", and "SHOULD" in this memo are to
   be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  TLDs for Testing, & Documentation Examples

   There is a need for top level domain (TLD) names that can be used for
   creating names which, without fear of conflicts with current or
   future actual TLD names in the global DNS, can be used for private
   testing of existing DNS related code, examples in documentation, DNS
   related experimentation, invalid DNS names, or other similar uses.

   For example, without guidance, a site might set up some local
   additional unused top level domains for testing of its local DNS code
   and configuration.  Later, these TLDs might come into actual use on
   the global Internet.  As a result, local attempts to reference the
   real data in these zones could be thwarted by the local test
   versions.  Or test or example code might be written that accesses a
   TLD that is in use with the thought that the test code would only be
   run in a restricted testbed net or the example never actually run.
   Later, the test code could escape from the testbed or the example be
   actually coded and run on the Internet.  Depending on the nature of
   the test or example, it might be best for it to be referencing a TLD
   permanently reserved for such purposes.

   To safely satisfy these needs, four domain names are reserved as
   listed and described below.  See also Section 4.

Internet-Draft        Reserved Top Level DNS Names             June 2008


2.1.  ".example"

   ".example" is RECOMMENDED for use in documentation or as examples.

2.2.  ".invalid"

   ".invalid" is intended for use in online construction of domain names
   that are sure to be invalid, and for which it is obvious at a glance
   that they are invalid.

   Applications MAY treat ".invalid" as what the name says.  For this
   technical reason reserving internationalized ".invalid" TLDs would be
   unwise.

2.3.  ".localhost"

   The ".localhost" TLD has traditionally been statically defined in
   host DNS implementations as having an address record pointing to the
   loop back IP address and is reserved for such use.  Any other use
   would conflict with widely deployed code which assumes this use.

   See [RFC1122] for IPv4 and [RFC4291] for IPv6 loop back addresses.

2.4.  ".test"

   ".test" and the new test TLDs in Section 4 are RECOMMENDED for use in
   testing of current or new DNS related code.  Applications SHOULD
   treat these test TLDs like any other TLD; a special handling could
   defeat the purpose of a test.


3.  Reserved Example Second Level Domain Names

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) also reserves the
   three second level domain names ".example.com", ".example.net", and
   ".example.org", which can be used in examples as explained in
   Section 2.1.

   When TLDs offer further second level domains for examples, the TLD
   administrators are encouraged to publish the relevant policies in
   their TLD as an informational RFC.

   The second level domain names "nic", "whois", and "www" are often
   reserved or used for administrative purposes of the TLD, e.g.,
   "whois.example" for the fully qualified domain name of a host with a
   whois server.  As with second level domains for examples this can be
   an issue in the case of a TLD redelegation.

Internet-Draft        Reserved Top Level DNS Names             June 2008


   Please note that there are no globally reserved LDH DNS labels below
   the top level, see [RFC4367].


4.  Internationalization Considerations

   In 2007 IANA created eleven IDN test TLDs.  The A-labels,
   corresponding languages, and IDN U-labels are listed below; see
   [RFC3490] or its [IDNAbis] successor for details about IDN.
   Applications SHOULD treat these IDN test TLDs as explained in
   Section 2.4.

      TLD A-label         Language            U-label (hex. code points)
    ".xn--0zwm56d"        Chinese (simplified)                 6d4b 8bd5
    ".xn--11b5bs3a9aj6g"  Hindi              92a 930 940 915 94d 937 93e
    ".xn--80akhbyknj4f"   Russian    438 441 43f 44b 442 430 43d 438 435
    ".xn--9t4b11yi5a"     Korean                          d14c c2a4 d2b8
    ".xn--deba0ad"        Yiddish                        5d8 5e2 5e1 5d8
    ".xn--g6w251d"        Chinese (traditional)                6e2c 8a66
    ".xn--hgbk6aj7f53bba" Persian            622 632 645 627 6cc 634 6cc
    ".xn--hlcj6aya9esc7a" Tamil              baa bb0 bbf b9f bcd b9a bc8
    ".xn--jxalpdlp"       Greek                  3b4 3bf 3ba 3b9 3bc 3ae
    ".xn--kgbechtv"       Arabic                 625 62e 62a 628 627 631
    ".xn--zckzah"         Japanese                        30c6 30b9 30c8


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA reserves the TLDs ".example", ".invalid", ".localhost", ".test",
   and eleven IDN test TLDs as noted above.  IANA reserves the second
   level domains ".example.com", ".example.net", and ".example.org".

   IANA creates a registry of reserved TLDs; this can be done alongside
   existing IANA TLD registries at the discretion of IANA.  The registry
   should contain references to the relevant specifications, for the
   fifteen reserved TLDs specified here references to this memo will do.

   Additional reserved TLDs require IETF review as defined in [RFC5226]
   in conjunction with [RFC2860].


6.  Security Considerations

   Confusion and conflict can be caused by the use of a current or
   future top level domain name in experimentation or testing, as an
   example in documentation, to indicate invalid names, or as a synonym
   for the loop back address.  Test and experimental software can escape
   and end up being run against the global operational DNS.  Even

Internet-Draft        Reserved Top Level DNS Names             June 2008


   examples used "only" in documentation can end up being coded and
   released or cause conflicts due to later real use and the possible
   acquisition of intellectual property rights in such "example" names.

   The reservation of several top level domain names for these purposes
   minimizes such confusion and conflict.

   [RFC4367] discusses various false assumptions based on domain labels,
   however this doesn't affect the reserved TLDs in this memo.

   Readers need to be aware that the IANA registry of reserved TLDs in
   Section 5 won't list all reserved TLDs for specific applications and
   protocols.  The registry can only list reserved TLDs if somebody
   bothered to propose it, typically in an Internet-Draft, and the
   proposal was accepted in an IETF review.

              (Revised)", April 2008,
              <http://tools.ietf.org/wg/idnabis>.


Appendix A.  Educational Info

   This informative appendix tries to answer three frequently asked
   questions:

   1.  As of 2008 IANA is the registrant of ".example.edu"; TLD ".edu"
       has no contract with ICANN; its administration is based on a five
       years contract with the US DoC renewed in 2006; see
       <http://net.educause.edu/edudomain/policy.asp>.  Under amendment
       6 of their current policy generic names cannot be registered.
       This is not exactly the same situation as for say ".example.org",
       where IANA is the registrant *and* registrar.

   2.  As of 2008 IANA is the registrant of ".example.info"; TLD ".info"
       was created by ICANN in 2001.  The ".info" registry agreement
       lists reserved DNS labels including "example"; see
       <http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/info/> appendix 6 (2006)
       and K (2001), respectively.  This is not exactly the same
       situation as for say ".example.org", where IANA is the registrant
       *and* registrar.

   3.  Ignoring [RFC2965] the TLD ".local" issue was discussed in a
       bunch of Internet-Drafts related to AS112, zeroconf, and
       [RFC3927].  Presumably TLD ".local" should be registered as
       reserved for technical reasons, but deserves its own document
       with the fine print.


Appendix B.  Document History

   Changes in version 07:

   o  Kept "nic", "whois", and "www" as known examples why there are no
      globally reserved LDH labels for whatever purpose below the top
      level.

   o  Proposals to add ".internal", ".local", ".localdomain", and
      ".uucp" not adopted.  This memo covers known test and example
      TLDs, as well as two other TLDs and three example SLDs inherited
      from [RFC2606].  Reserved TLDs for other purposes deserve separate
      documents.

   o  Added a note that internationalization of ".invalid" is a non-
      starter, as this TLD is expected to be hardwired in some

Internet-Draft        Reserved Top Level DNS Names             June 2008


      applications.  For ".localhost" that should be obvious.

   o  Review requests sent at different times to the APPS, general,
      [IDNAbis], INT, and OPS mailing lists.

   Changes in version 06:

   o  Explanations of the terms LDH, A-label, and IDN added in
      Section 1.  Just in case added a reference to [RFC4343].

   o  Downgraded 3696 to [RFC1123]; since March 2008 the best
      documentation of top labels is available in
      <http://rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=1123&eid=1353>.

   Changes in version 05:

   o  Donald offered to co-author this memo.

   o  Clarified that there are now additional TLDs recommended for
      tests, not only the original ".test" in Section 2.4.

   Changes in version 04:

   o  In the "Public Suffix List" debate SM quoted [RFC4085], added to
      Section 1.

   o  Replaced "A record" by "address record" with references to
      [RFC1122] and [RFC4291] in Section 2.3.

   o  Added IDN test U-labels (in a crude hex. format due to RFC layout
      limitations) with the help of <http://josefsson.org/idn.php/> and
      <http://www.imc.org/idna/do-idna.cgi>.

   Changes in version 03:

   o  Swapped IANA and security considerations based on feedback, since
      version 01 the order anyway did not more follow <http://
      tools.ietf.org/html/draft-rfc-editor-rfc2223bis-08#section-4>.

   o  Dave Cridland proposed another [RFC4367] caveat, there are no
      globally reserved LDH labels below the top level.  LDH excludes
      special cases such as the empty label reserved for the root, and
      leaf labels starting with an underscore.

   o  The informative Appendix A hopefully answers frequently asked
      questions about ".example.edu", ".example.info", and ".local".

   Changes in version 02:



Ellermann & Eastlake    Expires December 30, 2008               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        Reserved Top Level DNS Names             June 2008


   o  Added the related [RFC3849] and [I-D.iana-rfc3330bis] references.
      Added an [RFC4367] reference to the security considerations, as
      this explains one of many issues with any "well-known" label below
      the top level.

   o  IDN test SLDs not yet added, it is not clear if they are also
      reserved TLDs.  Any "globally reserved labels" at other levels
      including the second level would be utter dubious.

   o  Improved the IANA Considerations Section 5 based on feedback.  The
      registry of reserved TLDs needs references to the relevant
      specifications.

   o  Added a caveat that the IANA registry of reserved TLDs cannot list
      all obscure ideas of specific applications and protocols; somebody
      has to trigger an IETF review for new registrations.

   Changes in version 01:

   o  Various editorial issues found by Tony Hansen fixed.

   o  Added an [IDNAbis] reference.  The authors believe that the IETF
      is not entitled to decree that ".example.edu" belongs to the set
      of three example-SLDs reserved by IANA.

   Changes in version 00:

   o  John Klensin suggested clarifying the guidelines for examples in
      [RFC2606], referenced by <http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html>.
      Documenting the eleven new IDN test TLDs was anyway desirable.
