1.  Introduction

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [1] is widely used for voice
   over IP, Internet television, video conferencing, and various other
   real-time and streaming media applications.  Despite this, the base
   RTP specification provides very limited options for media security,
   and defines no standard key exchange mechanism.  Rather, a number of
   extensions are defined to provide confidentiality and authentication
   of media streams, and to exchange security keys.  This memo outlines
   why it is appropriate that multiple extension mechanisms are defined,
   rather than mandating a single media security and keying mechanism.

   This memo provides information for the community; it does not specify
   a standard of any kind.

   The structure of this memo is as follows: we begin, in Section 2 by
   describing the scenarios in which RTP is deployed.  Following this,
   Section 3 outlines the implications of this range of scenarios for
   media confidentially and authentication, and Section 4 outlines the
   implications for key exchange.  Section 5 then concludes and gives
   some recommendations.  Finally, Section 6 outlines the security
   considerations, and Section 7 outlines IANA considerations.


2.  RTP Applications and Deployment Scenarios

   The range of application and deployment scenarios where RTP has been
   used includes, but is not limited to, the following:

   o  Point-to-point voice telephony (fixed and wireless networks)

   o  Point-to-point video conferencing

   o  Centralised group video conferencing with a multipoint conference
      unit (MCU)

   o  Any Source Multicast video conferencing (light-weight sessions;
      Mbone conferencing)

   o  Point-to-point streaming audio and/or video

   o  Single Source Multicast streaming to large group (IPTV)

   o  Replicated unicast streaming to a group

   o  Interconnecting components in music production studios and video
      editing suites

   o  Interconnecting components of distributed simulation systems

   o  Streaming real-time sensor data

   As can be seen, these scenarios vary from point-to-point to very
   large multicast groups, from interactive to non-interactive, and from
   low bandwidth (kilobits per second) to very high bandwidth (multiple
   gigabits per second).  While most of these applications run over UDP,
   some use TCP or DCCP as their transport.  Some run on highly reliable
   optical networks, others use low rate unreliable wireless networks.
   Some applications of RTP operate entirely within a single trust
   domain, others are inter-domain, with untrusted (and potentially
   unknown) users.  The range of scenarios is wide, and growing both in
   number and in heterogeneity.


3.  Implications for RTP Media Security

   The wide range of application scenarios where RTP is used has led to
   the development of multiple solutions for media security, considering
   different requirements.  Perhaps the most general of these solutions
   is the Secure RTP (SRTP) framework [2].  This is an application-level
   media security solution, encrypting the media payload data (not the
   RTP headers) to provide some degree of confidentiality, and providing
   optional source origin authentication.  It was carefully designed to
   be both low overhead, and to support the group communication features
   of RTP, across a range of networks.

   SRTP is not the only media security solution in use, however, and
   alternatives are more appropriate for some scenarios.  For example,
   many client-server streaming media applications run over a single TCP
   connection, multiplexing media data with control information on that
   connection (for example, on an RTSP connection).  The natural way to
   provide media security for such client-server media applications is
   to use TLS to protect the TCP connection, sending the RTP media data
   over the TLS connection.  Using the SRTP framework in addition to TLS
   is unncessary, and would result in double encryption of the media,
   and SRTP cannot be used instead of TLS since it is RTP-specific, and
   so cannot protect the control traffic.

   Other RTP use cases work over networks which provide security at the
   network layer, using IPsec.  For example, certain 3GPP networks need
   IPsec security associations for other purposes, and can reuse those
   to secure the RTP session.  SRTP is, once again, unnecessary in such
   environments, and its use would only introduce overhead for no gain.

   Finally, the link layer may be secure, and it may be known that the
   RTP media data is constrained to that single link (for example, when

   operating in a studio environment, with physical link security).  An
   environment like this is inherently constrained, but might avoid the
   need for application, transport, or network layer media security.

   All these are application scenarios where RTP has seen commerical
   deployment.  Other use case also exist, with additional requirements.
   There is no media security protocol that is appropriate for all these
   environments.  Accordingly, multiple RTP media security protocols can
   be expected to remain in wide use.


4.  Implications for Key Management

   Similar issues apply when considering key management protocols for
   RTP sessions, and a wide range of solutions have been developed in
   this space:

   o  The most common use case for RTP is probably point-to-point voice
      calls or centralised group conferences, negotiated using SIP with
      the SDP offer/answer model, operating on a trusted infrastructure.
      In such environments, SDP security descriptions [3] or the MIKEY
      [4] protocol are appropriate keying mechanisms, piggybacked onto
      the SDP exchange.

   o  SIP/SDP with SIPS

   o  SIP/SDP with S/MIME

   o  Point-to-point RTP sessions may be negotiated using SIP with the
      offer/answer model, but operating over a network with untrusted
      infrastructure.  In such environments, the key management protocol
      is run on the media path, bypassing the untrusted infrastructure.
      Protocols such as ZRTP or DTLS protocols are useful here.

   o  For point-to-point client-server streaming of RTP over RTSP, a TLS
      association is appropriate to manage keying material, in much the
      same manner as would be used to secure an HTTP session.

   o  Email with SDP, secured using X.500 or PGP

   o  SDP file retrieved using HTTPS

   o  FLUTE using S/MIME to secure SDP

   o  SAP with SDP

   o  (TBD: complete this list)

   A more detailed survey of requirements for media security management
   protocols can be found in [5].  As can be seen, the range of use
   cases is wide, and there is no single protocol that is appropriate
   for all scenarios.


5.  Conclusions

   It would clearly be desirable if a single media security solution and
   a single key management solution could be developed, satisfying the
   range of use cases for RTP.  The authors are not aware of any such
   solution, however, and it is not clear that any single solution can
   be developed.  In the absense of such a solution, it is hoped that
   this memo explains why SRTP is not mandatory as the media security
   solution for RTP-based systems, and why we can expect multiple key
   management solutions for systems using RTP.

   In respect to the above it is important for any RTP-based application
   to consider how they meet the application's security requirements.
   This will requires some analysis to determine these requirements.
   Followed by a selection of preferably a single to mandatory to
   implement solution including the desired RTP traffic protection and
   key-management.  As SRTP can be used in a large number of use cases,
   it is a preferred solution for the protection of the RTP traffic, for
   those use cases where it is applicable.  Currently it is much harder
   to point out a preferred key-management solution.
