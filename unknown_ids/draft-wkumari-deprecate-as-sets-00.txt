                       Deprecation of BGP AS_SET.
                   draft-wkumari-deprecate-as-sets-00

Abstract

   This document deprecates the use of the AS_SET type of the AS_PATH in
   BGPv4.  This is done to simply the design and implementation of the
   BGP protocol and to make the semantics of the originator of a route
   more clear.

2.  Introduction

   The AS_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH attribute ([RFC4271],
   Section 4.3) is created by a router that is performing route
   aggregation and contains an unordered set of ASs that the update has
   traversed.  By performing aggregation, a router is, in essence,
   combining multiple routes into a new route.

   The RPKI ([I-D.ietf-sidr-arch]) provides a cryptographic means to
   validate that a specific AS is authorized to announce a specific
   network.  The creation of an aggregate that contains an AS_SET means
   that the aggregating router is originating a route for address space
   that it cannot cryptographically prove that it is authorized to
   originate.  While it may be possible to include the route origin
   attestations (ROA) from all of the routes that contribute to the
   aggregate into the aggregate, this ends up being messy, inelegant and
   has partial states that suck caterpillar snot!

   From analysis of past Internet routing dumps it is apparent that
   aggregation that involves AS_SETs is almost never used in practice
   and, when it is usually contains reserved AS numbers ([RFC1930]) and
   / or only a single AS in the AS_SET.  The reductions in table size
   provided by the aggregation is outweighed by additional complexity in
   the BGP protocol and confusion regarding what exactly is meant by
   originating a route.

3.  Deployment and modification of behavior

   It is expected that initially AS_SETs will be deprecated by the few
   operators that are currently generating them, and operator policy
   changing to filter them.  Over time BGP implementations MAY no longer
   support generating them, and eventually implementations MAY quietly
   ignore updates with AS_SETs in them .  Operators should take note
   that new protocols (such as those that make use of the RPKI) are
   likely to not work with AS_SETs and may ignore routes (treat as
   infeasible) containing them.

5.  Security Considerations

   By removing support for the AS_SET path segment type of the AS_PATH
   attribute future BGP implementations can be simplified..  This will
   also simplify the design and implementation of the RPKI and systems
   that will rely on it.  By removing corner cases we remove complexity
   and code that is not exercised very often, which decreases the attack
   surface.
