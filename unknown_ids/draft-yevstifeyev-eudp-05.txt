                   Extendable User Datagram Protocol
                      <draft-yevstifeyev-eudp-05>

Abstract

   This document introduces the experimental extension to User Datagram
   Protocol (UDP) - Extendable User Datagram Protocol (EUDP) - that
   allows to extend its header (and, therefore, functionality) by
   options.  Such solution lets the client to choose what features will
   be provided and what will not, and, therefore, is more liberal than,
   for instance, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Datagram
   Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), that make use of many functions
   mandatory, but may be more complicated than UDP, since may provide
   other needed functions, except only core transport features.

INTERNET DRAFT                    EUDP                  January 25, 2011


1.  Introduction

   User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [RFC768] is one of the most widely-used
   transport-level protocol.  One of the things which makes it so
   popular is its simplicity.  However in some cases this causes lack of
   facilities, which can be provided  by other protocols, such as
   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [RFC793] or Datagram Congestion
   Control Protocol [RFC4340]. 

   During the history of UDP some attempts have been made to improve it
   by adding some features (for instance UDP-Lite [RFC3828]), but these
   proposals were too specific and did not gain popularity.

   EUDP, extension to UDP, proposed by this document, is intended to be
   a universal solution, which combines simplicity of UDP and
   extensibility of TCP by adding an options space to UDP header.  This
   allows the client to choose what function except core transport ones
   will be provided and what will not.  Unlike, for instance, TCP, that
   makes using, e.g., packet delivery acknowledgment system mandatory
   for all the packets in transaction, EUDP lets the client to choose
   what packets should be acknowledged by other side and what will not. 

   Please note, that the extension, defined in this document is
   experimental and does not purport to be any kind of Standard.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The term 'EUDP packet' means UDP packet with EUDP sub-header.

2.  Model of Work

   EUDP works as follows.  The EUDP sub-header is placed directly after
   the UDP header.  The UDP header fields 'Source Port' and 'Destination
   Port' are set to TBD1 to identify the use of EUDP.  The real values
   of these fields are put into corresponding fields into EUDP sub-
   header, called 'Source Service code' and 'Destination Service Code',
   respectively.  It also contains information about the length of
   Options Area.  The transferred data are put directly after the EUDP
   sub-headers.

   Then UDP packet with EUDP header is sent to the destination host via
   Internet Protocol (IP) or other protocol with the same functionality
   that is supported by the destination host.  Once the destination host
   that supports EUDP received the UDP packet with the 'Source Port' and
   'Destination Port' fields set to TBD1, it examines the EUDP sub-
   header and finds out the real source and destination port numbers,
   data offset and other information, processes options and sends the
   answering EUDP packet.

   EUDP provides stateless connection.  It id a peer-to-peer protocol,
   i.e. not client-server one.

   Destination Service Code (16 bits) - REQUIRED field that contains the
   real value of 'Destination Port' UDP header field (see Section 2 of
   this document), which is defined RFC 768 [RFC768]. 

   Data Offset (16 bits) - REQUIRED field which is the number of 32 bit
   words in UDP header plus EUDP sub-header.  The UDP header with EUDP
   sub-header (even one including options) MUST be an integral number of
   32 bits long.

   Options (variable length) - OPIONAL field, that is used to carry EUDP
   options in.  EUDP option are described in Section 3.2. 

   Padding (variable length) - OPTIONAL field.  The EUDP sub-header
   padding is used to ensure that the EUDP sub-header ends and data
   begins on a 32 bit boundary.  The padding MUST be composed of zeros.

3.2. EUDP Options

3.2.1. Generic Description

   EUDP options are placed into the 'Options' sub-header field.  Options
   may occupy space at the end of the EUDP sub-header and are a multiple
   of 8 bits in length.  All options MUST be included in the UDP
   checksum.  An option SHALL begin on any octet boundary.  There are
   two cases for the format of an option:

     a) a single octet of option-kind.

     b) an octet of option-kind, an octet of option-length, and the
     actual option-data octets.  The option-length counts the two octets
     of option-kind and option-length as well as the option-data octets.

   Note that the list of options may be shorter than the data offset
   field might imply.  The content of the header beyond the 'End Of
   Options List' option MUST be header padding (i.e., zeros).

   All options can be _mandatory_ or _optional_ for support.  EUDP nodes
   MUST support all _mandatory_ options.  Support of _optional_ options
   is OPTIONAL.

   Pre-defined options are specified in Section 3.2.2.

3.2.2. Pre-Defined Options

   This section specifies pre-defined EUDP options.

3.2.2.1. 'No Operation' Option

   +--------+
   | Kind=0 |
   +--------+

   This option may be used between options, for example, to align the
   beginning of a subsequent option on a word boundary. 

   The option is _mandatory_ for support.

3.2.2.2. 'End Of Options List' Option

   +--------+
   | Kind=1 |
   +--------+

   This option code indicates the end of the options list.  This might
   not coincide with the end of the EUDP sub-header according to the
   'Data Offset' field.  This SHALL be used at the end of all options,
   not the end of each option, and need only be used if the end of the
   options would not otherwise coincide with the end of the EUDP header.

   The option is _mandatory_ for support.

3.2.2.3. 'Echo Request' Option

   +--------+--------+-------//-------+
   | Kind=2 | Length |      Data      |
   +--------+--------+-------//-------+

   The 'Echo Request' option is used to provide the possibility of echo
   debugging using the EUDP.  The 'Data' part of option may consist of
   arbitrary octets.  The receiver of the packet with this option SHALL
   send back the packet with 'Echo Response' option (see Section
   3.2.2.4).

   The option is _mandatory_ for support.

3.2.2.4. 'Echo Response' Option

   +--------+--------+-------//-------+
   | Kind=3 | Length |      Data      |
   +--------+--------+-------//-------+

   The 'Echo Response' option is used to answer the packets with 'Echo
   Request' option.  The packet consisting 'Echo Response' option SHALL
   be send after receiving any EUDP packet with 'Echo Request' option. 
   The 'Data' part of the option MUST be the same as in received 'Echo
   Request' option.

   The option is _mandatory_ for support.

3.2.2.5. 'Packet Identifier' Option

   +--------+--------+--------+-------+
   | Kind=4 |Length=4|    Packet ID   |
   +--------+--------+--------+-------+

   The 'Packet Identifier' option is asked to request the acknowledgment
   of the single packet.  The 'Packet ID' field is filled by arbitrary
   bytes by the sender of the packet with this option.  The receiver of
   the packet with 'Packet Identifier' option SHALL send back the packet
   with 'Packet Acknowledgment' option (see Section 3.2.2.6). See
   Section 3.4 for details.

   The option is _mandatory_ for support.

2.3.2.6. 'Packet Acknowledgment' Option 

   +--------+--------+--------+-------+
   | Kind=5 |Length=4| ACK Packet ID  |
   +--------+--------+--------+-------+

   The 'Packet Acknowledgment' option is used to answer the packets with
   'Packet Identifier' option.  The 'ACK Packet ID' field in the option
   in the packet sent to the originating host for packet with 'Packet
   Identifier' option MUST be the same as in received from this host
   packet.  See Section 3.4 for details.

   The option is _mandatory_ for support.

2.3.2.7. 'Options Negotiation Request' Option 

   +--------+--------+--------+-------//-------+
   | Kind=6 | Length | Opt.#1 | Opt#2 .. Opt#N |
   +--------+--------+--------+-------//-------+

   The 'Options Negotiation Request' option is used to initiate the
   negotiation of used _optional_ options.  If the EUDP host wants to
   use one or more _optional_ options, it SHOULD firstly negotiate their
   use with the other host.  The Data area of the option contains the
   numbers of options the host wants to negotiate.  The EUDP host that

INTERNET DRAFT                    EUDP                  January 25, 2011


   received the packet with this option SHALL answer with the packet
   with 'Options Negotiation Response' (see Section 2.3.2.8).  The
   'Options Negotiation Request' option MUST contain the numbers of
   _optional_ options only.

   The option is _mandatory_ for support.

2.3.2.8. 'Options Negotiation Response' Option 

   +--------+--------+--------+-------//-------+
   | Kind=7 | Length | Opt.#1 | Opt#2 .. Opt#N |
   +--------+--------+--------+-------//-------+

   The 'Options Negotiation Response' option is used to complete the
   options negotiation.  Once EUDP host receive the 'Options Negotiation
   Request' option (see Section 2.3.2.8), it SHALL check what option
   from the list mentioned in the negotiation request it supports and
   put appropriate values into the 'Options Negotiation Response'
   option, put it into the EUDP packet and send back.

   The option is _mandatory_ for support.

3.3. Pseudo Header

   EUDP does not use pseudo header.

3.4. Packet Delivery Acknowledgment Mechanism

   EUDP provides the possibility to request the acknowledgment of the
   single EUDP packet.  This is provided by 'Packet Identifier' and
   'Packet Acknowledgment' options.  In the simplest form, the
   acknowledgment mechanism works as follows.

   Once EUDP host (let it be A) wants to request the acknowledgment of
   delivery of some packet, it puts the 'Packet Identifier' option in it
   and sends this packet to another EUDP host (let it be B).  Once B
   received the A's packet, it checks the 'Packet Identifier' option to
   find out the packet identifier.  After it finds it out, this number
   becomes the 'ACK Packet Identifier', that is put into 'Packet
   Acknowledgment' option and sent to A.  The Packet identifiers MAY be
   reused once they are acknowledged, since EUDP provides stateless
   connection.

   Compared with acknowledgment mechanism of TCP [RFC793], EUDP provides
   simpler and more liberal system.  While TCP makes using the packet
   sequence numbers and acknowledgement mandatory, EUDP allows the host
   to decide whether the packet needs to be acknowledged by the other
   side or not.

3.5. Compatibility with UDP

   The applications which use UDP can safely use EUDP with no options
   instead.


4.  Security Considerations

   Generic security issues for UDP concern EUDP as well.

   Additional security can be provided by additional options. This
   document does not define such options.

   UDP itself does not provide any authentication features. Such
   features can be provided by additional options, which are not defined
   by this document. 


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1. EUDP Options Numbers Registry

   IANA is asked to create and maintain the registry named 'EUDP Options
   Numbers Registry', which consists of 4 values: Option Kind, Option
   Length, Support Criteria, Description and Reference. They are
   described below.

     'Option Kind' value is integer; values from 0 to 255 are assigned.

     'Option length' may be omitted (for one octet options), be stated
     as an integer or 'variable'. 

     'Support Criteria' can be assigned as 'Mandatory' and 'Optional'. 

     'Description' value contains the short description of the option.

     'Reference' contains the reference to the document that specifies
     the option.

   The initial values are given below; assignments to this registry for
   _mandatory_ options are to be made following the 'IETF Consensus'
   policies; for _optional_ options - following the 'RFC required'
   policies. [RFC5226]

   The Option Kind 0 is assigned for 'No Operation' option.  No Option
   Length value is assigned for it.  The Support Criteria for this
   option is 'mandatory'.  The Reference document is this RFC xxxx.

   The Option Kind 1 is assigned for 'End Of Options List' option.  No
   Option Length value is assigned for it.  The Support Criteria for
   this option is 'mandatory'.  The Reference document is this RFC xxxx.

   The Option Kind 2 is assigned for 'Echo Request' option.  The Option

5.2. EUDP Service Codes

   Since EUDP service codes are used in the meaning of port numbers and,
   therefore, numbers used as UDP port numbers are acceptable for use as
   EUDP service codes, IANA is asked to mark the UDP port numbers
   registry that the UDP port numbers are suitable for EUDP with the
   reference to this document.
