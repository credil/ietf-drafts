Abstract

   This document reconsiders the reasons why the use of /127 was
   regarded as harmful and reevaluates some rationales for using it for
   IPv6 point-to-point links.

   This document adheres fundamentally to RFC 3627 [RFC3627].  The main
   difference is that the use of /127 IPv6 prefix length is no longer
   considered as harmful.

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Although the use of /127 prefix length on IPv6 point-to-point links
   has been viewed as harmful [RFC3627], experience has shown this to
   not be the case, because Subnet-Router anycast address has not been
   used in practice.  This document reevaluates the reasons why this was
   considered harmful and provides some rationales for using /127 (and
   other long prefixes e.g. /112-/126).


3.  Scope Of This Memo

   This document is applicable to cases where operators assign specific
   addresses on point-to-point links and do not rely on link-local
   addresses.  Most operators assign specific addresses for purposes of
   management, reverse DNS resolution of traceroutes, network monitoring
   infrastructure, and so on.


4.  Reconsidering the problems with /127

   RFC 4291 [RFC4291] says all unicast address Interface IDs, (except
   those that start with the binary value 000), are required to be 64
   bits long and to be constructed with a Modified EUI-64 format.  In
   addition, it defines Subnet-Router anycast address, which is intended
   to be used for applications where a node needs to communicate with
   any one of the set of routers.

   As RFC3627 [RFC3627] has already pointed out, the usability of a
   Subnet-Router anycast address between two routers on a point-to-point
   link is questionable.  Moreover, there are security concerns in
   mandating their use.  RFC 2526 [RFC2526] contains the following:

   "The use of any type of reserved anycast addresses poses a security
   concern only in allowing potential attackers a well-known address to
   attack.  By designating certain services to be located at specific
   reserved anycast addresses, an attacker may more profitably focus an
   attack against such a specific service."

   RFC3627 [RFC3627] indicated that the use of /127 was harmful based on
   the condition that Subnet-Router anycast address was a mandatory

   requirement.  It brought up a conflict between the /127 masks and the
   existence of Subnet-Router anycast addresses.  However, Subnet-router
   anycast address has not been implemented and in practice, this has
   not been a problem.

   Therefore, while there could be merit in the uniform treatment for
   any link type (whether the link is point-to-point or broadcast/
   multicast media), if it is important to treat particular link types
   differently, operators should be free to make this determination as
   assign suitable prefix length including /127.


5.  Rationale for using /127

   There are some benefits for network operators to use /127 prefix
   length for IPv6 point-to-point links.

   Points which are specific to /127.

      As described in [PINGPONG], a forwarding loop may occur when the
      link-type is point-to-point and the prefix length is shorter than
      /127, while this does not affect interfaces that perform Neighbor
      Discovery.  In consequence, configuring a shorter than /127 prefix
      would create an attack vector in the network unless otherwise
      mitigated.

      The latest ICMPv6 specification [RFC4443] included a solution to
      this matter, but a few issues still remain :

         1) A rule described in ICMPv6 [RFC4443] indicates that a
         Destination Unreachable (Code 3) message should be sent by a
         router rather than forwarding packets back onto point-to-point
         links from which they were received if their destination
         address belongs to the link itself.  Checking all traffic for
         this condition is likely to affect performance.

         2) There could be a case that a packet needs to be sent back
         onto point-to-point links from which they were received.  For
         example, LER (Label Edge Router) could just forward the packet
         solely based on its label without IP resolution.  In this case,
         if the destination was the LER's egress interface, then the
         downstream router would do an IP lookup and sent back to the
         interface.

      So the use of /127 prefix length on point-to-point links (along
      with disabled Subnet-Router anycast) is a simpler and more
      practical option to avoid this matter.

   Points which are not necessarily specific to /127.

      - With the use of /127 or even other long prefix, the interface
      IDs are simpler and easier to remember (e.g., the Interface ID is
      1 or 0).

      - Though address space conservation doesn't carry much weight
      today in the case of IPv6, it may be desirable to use the minimum
      amount needed.

      - The current recommendation of /64 leaves a broad unused address
      space.  Considering that the IPv4 "Darknet" is drawing
      considerable malware traffic [RFC4948], it is safer to narrow down
      the unused space.


6.  Appendix

   Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] and SLAAC [RFC4862] can be a point of
   vulnerability as mentioned in [RFC3756].  So it MAY be safer to
   disable them as well, when they are not required.  But this is beyond
   the scope of this document.


7.  Security Considerations

   This draft addresses, among other things, a security issue.


8.  IANA Considerations

   None.
