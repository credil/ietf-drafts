    <abstract>
      <t>Various V6 transition strategies require the introduction
      of large-scale NATs (NAT444, NAT64) to share the limited supply of
      IPv4 addresses available in the network until transition is
      complete. There has recently been debate over how to manage
      the sharing of ports between different subscribers assigned the 
      same IPv4 address. One factor in the discussion is the operational
      requirement to log the assignment of transport addresses to
      subscribers. It has been argued that dynamic sharing of ports
      between subscribers requires the generation of an excessive
      volume of logs. This document suggests a way to achieve dynamic port
      sharing while keeping log volumes low.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>During the IPv6 transition period, some large-scale NAT devices may
   be introduced, e.g.
   NAT444 (CGN - Carrier Grade NAT), NAT64, etc. When a NAT device needs to
set up
   a new connection for the user behind the NAT, it needs to create a new 
   mapping entry for the new connection, which will contain source IP 
   address, source port, converted source IP address, converted source port,
   protocol(TCP/UDP/ICMP), etc.</t>

   <t>For the purpose of troubleshooting, and also required by regulations, 
   operators must keep logs of network NAT mapping 
   entries for a period of time, e.g. 6 months, so the NAT 
   device needs to generate logs for mapping entries. A traditional method 
   is to generate a log for each mapping entry. When a connection expires,
   the mapping entry will be deleted, and the corresponding log will be 
   sent to a log storage server.</t>   
   
<t>   Some high performance CGN devices may need to create a million or more
   new sessions per 
   second. If logs are generated for each mapping entry, the 
   log traffic could reach fifty megabytes per second or more, which would
   be a problem 
   for log generation, transmission and storage.</t>
   
<t>To reduce the cost of log storage, <xref target="I-D.nishitani-cgn"/> 
   proposes to fix the port range for each user/CPE, and only one log will be
   generated for each user. But this would significantly reduce the number 
   of subscribers that could share a public IP address, as discussed in 
   <xref target="I-D.softwire-dual-stack-lite"/>.</t>

<section anchor="proposal" title="A Suggested Solution">

<t>   We propose a solution that allows dynamic sharing of port ranges
   between users while minimizing the number of logs that have to be generated.
   Briefly, ports are allocated to the user in blocks. Logs are generated
   only when blocks are allocated or deallocated. This provides the necessary
   traceability while reducing log generation by a factor equal to the block
   size, as compared with fully dynamic port allocation.</t>

<t> Here is how the proposal would work in greater detail. 
   When the user sends out the first packet, a port 
   resource pool is allocated for the user, e.g. assign ports 2000~2300
   of a public IP address to the user's resource pool. Only one log 
   should be generated for this port segment. When the CGN needs to set up a 
   new mapping entry for the user, it can use a port in the user's resource
   pool and the corresponding 
   public IP address. If the user needs more port 
   resources, the CGN can allocate another port segment, ports 3000~3050, to 
   the user's resource pool. Again , just one log needs to be generated for
this 
   port segment.</t>

<t> If some port segment is not used for some configurable time, 
   e.g., one minute, after initial allocation or after the mapping timer has 
   expired for every port in the segment, the CGN can remove the port segment
   from the user's resource 
   pool, and make it available for other users. The deallocation is logged
when it 
   occurs.</t>
   
   <t>This solution can reduce the number of logs significantly and also make 
   good use of the public IP address resource.</t>
