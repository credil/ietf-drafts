      <t>
This document defines an RTP payload format for the Reed-Solomon Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes for the erasure channel.
The format defined by this document enables the protection of source media encapsulated in RTP with one or more repair flows and
is based on the FEC framework and the SDP Elements for FEC Framework. The Reed-Solomon codes used in this document belong to the
class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes which means they offer optimal protection, and they are effective in front of
random or bursty packet losses.

    <section title="Introduction">
    <!-- --------------------------------- -->

     <t> This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) that is generated by the Reed-Solomon code.  </t>
     <t>By nature, interactive Real-time applications are extremely sensitive to delay and require very low
   latency.  As a result, retransmission of lost packets and using other
   closed-loop schemes are not valid options while the use of Forward
   Error Correction (FEC) is an effective approach.   </t>
     <t>A primary requirement from FEC for real time applications is the ability to
   correctly recover from both random and bursty packet losses.  The
   Reed-Solomon FEC codes used in this document belong to the class of
   Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes that are optimal in terms of
   erasure recovery capability for both situations. </t>  
     <t>The format defined by this document enables the protection of media source flow with
   one or more repair flows without adding additional information to the
   source packets.  Such behavior reduces the delay presented by any FEC
   scheme and maintains backwards compatibility with non FEC-enabled
   receivers.   </t>
    <t>Number of previous drafts were composed to draw different FEC schemes suitable for different applications. 
   The scheme defined in this draft is designed to compensate a burst of packet loss over RTP networks with minimum delay, 
   which is needed in interactive IP-based applications such as video conferencing.</t>
    <t>The method described in this document is generic to all media types and provides the sender with the flexibility of deciding if FEC protection is required and if so, how many protecting packets and how many source packets to use in a block according to network conditions. Furthermore it allows applying unequal error protection that provides different level of protection to different packets. For example, it can be combined with Scalable Video Coding to protect only the base layer packets of the video flow.
   At the receiver, both the FEC and original media are received.  If no media packets are lost, the FEC packets can be ignored.  In the event    of a loss, the FEC packets can be combined with other received media   to recover all or part of the missing media packets.  </t>
   
    <t>The Reed-Solomon codes used in this document have been specified in <xref target="RFC5510"/> and are compatible with Luigi Rizzo codec (see <xref target="Rizzo97"/>).
   This document is compliant with the Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework (described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework"/>) and SDP Elements for FEC Framework (described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-fecframe-sdp-elements"/> <xref target="RFC4566"/>).      
   This draft completes <xref target="I-D.roca-fecframe-rs"/> by defining Reed-Solomon usage for RTP transport (<xref target="RFC3550"/>) and specifies the appropriate media types (see <xref target="RFC4288"/> <xref target="RFC4855"/> <xref target="RFC4856"/>).

    <section anchor="reed_solomon_codes" title="Reed Solomon Codes">
    <!-- --------------------------------- -->

   <t>
   Reed Solomon codes take a group of k source symbols and generates n - k repair symbols.
   A receiver needs to receive any k of the n source or repair symbols in order to
   recover the remaining n-k symbols.
   As explained in <xref target="RFC5510"/>, the Reed-Solomon algorithm operates
   over m-bit elements, where m is the finite field exponent, GF(2^m), taken from the
   various encoding symbols.
   Symbols are composed of S "m-bit elements" each.
   In the usual case of GF(2^8), elements are bytes and the symbol size S is equal to the
   symbol size in bytes.
   </t>

   <t>
   The detailed operation and theory behind Reed Solomon codes is out of the scope of this document.
   For more information on Reed Solomon codes, the reader is referred to <xref target="Rizzo97"/>
   and <xref target="RFC5510"/>.

    <section anchor="source_block_creation" title="Source Block Creation">
    <!-- --------------------------------- -->

  <t>This draft specifies how to protect an RTP source flow using one or more FEC repair flows.
  In order to authorize backward compatibility, the source flow is not modified at all by the
  FEC Scheme (i.e., FEC source packets are identical to the RTP packets received from the
  application).</t>

  <t>A source block for the Reed-Solomon code contains k source symbols and encoding generates
  n_r = n - k repair symbols.
  In this scheme, each Application Data Unit (ADU) is composed of an RTP packet received from
  the application and corresponds to a single source symbol.
  Therefore a source block (also called ADU block) contains exactly k RTP packets. 
  In this scheme, each FEC repair packet contains a single repair symbol generated during
  Reed-Solomon encoding.
  Therefore, for this block, the n_r FEC repair packets are transmitted along with the k unmodified
  FEC source packets.
  Note that the k and n_r values may vary from one block to another since they depend on the source
  ADU flow and source block creation algorithm (see below).
  </t>

  <t>The following steps MUST be followed in order to create a source block:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="numbers">
	<t>Determine the largest ADU size in bytes of the source block (i.e., the largest RTP packet
	size, considering both the RTP header and the payload).
	The encoding symbol length in bytes for this block, E, is given by: E = 2 + largest ADU size.</t>
      	<t>For each ADU of this source block, of index i, create a byte array of size E as follows:
		<list style="letters">
		<t>The first two bytes, L[i] (Length), contain the length of this
			ADU, as an unsigned 16-bit integer stored in network byte order (i.e., big endian).
			This length is for the ADU itself and does not include the L[i] or Pad[i] fields.</t>
		<t>Append the entire RTP packet (including its RTP header).</t>
		<t>Then zero padding is added after ADU i (if needed) in field Pad[i] for alignment purposes,
		up to a size of exactly E bytes. Of course, the largest packet of this block does not contain
		any padding.</t>
		</list>
	</t>
 	<t>Append all the byte arrays one after the other so that the RTP packets are in increasing
		RTP sequence number, taking wraparound of the RTP sequence number into account.</t>
      </list>
    </t>

  <t>Figure <xref target="fig_src_block_creation"/> illustrates how a source block is created
  from 4 RTP packets, ADU 0 to ADU 3, with different sizes, and FEC repair packets are created.

<t>
Note that neither the initial 2 bytes nor the optional padding are sent over the network
(remember that the source packets are sent unmodified, without any extra padding).
However, they are considered during FEC encoding.
It means that a receiver who lost a certain FEC source packet (e.g., the
UDP datagram containing this FEC source packet) will be able to recover the ADUI
if FEC decoding succeeds.
Thanks to the initial 2 bytes, this receiver will get rid of the padding (if any).

    <t>This section defines the formats of the source and repair packets.</t>

     <section anchor="source_packets" title="FEC Source Packets">
     <!-- --------------------------------- -->

<t>
The FEC Framework requires that FEC source packets contain information identifying the source block 
and the position within the source block occupied by the packet. However, in order to maintain backwards compatibility, 
the scheme defined by this document enables the receiver to get this information without appending additional information 
to the source packet.
Specifically this information is obtained using the combination of sequence number found in the RTP header and
information provided in the repair FEC Payload ID of each FEC repair packet.
This solution enables both non-FEC-capable and FEC-capable receivers to receive and interpret the same source
packets sent in a multicast session.
</t>

    </section>

 
    <section anchor="repair_packets" title="FEC Repair Packets">
    <!-- --------------------------------- -->

<t>
The FEC repair packets contain information that enables the receiver to reconstruct the source block.
This is done by using the RTP header of the FEC repair packets as well as the repair FEC Payload ID dedicated header
(see <xref target="I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework"/>, section 6.4.1) that is placed within the RTP payload.
There MUST be a single repair symbol per FEC repair packet.
Figure <xref target="fig_repair_pkt_format"/> shows such a FEC repair packet.

         <!-- --------------------------------- -->

    <t>The RTP header is formatted according to <xref target="RFC3550"/> with some further clarifications listed below:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
 
    <t>	Marker (M) Bit:  This bit is not used for this payload type, and is set to 0.</t>
    <t>	Payload Type:  The (dynamic) payload type for the repair packets is determined through out-of-band means.
	Note that this document registers new payload formats for the repair packets (Refer to Section 5 for details).
	According to <xref target="RFC3550"/>, an RTP receiver that cannot recognize a payload type must discard it.
	This provides for backward compatibility. The FEC mechanisms can then be used in a multicast group with mixed FEC-capable
	and non-FEC-capable receivers. If a non-FEC-capable receiver receives a repair packet, it will not recognize the payload type,
	and hence, will discard the repair packet.
	In case more than one repair flow is used, different Payload Types will be used to distinguish between the different flows.</t>
    <t>	Sequence Number (SN):  The sequence number maintains the standard definition.
	It is one higher than the sequence number in the previously transmitted repair packet.
	The initial value of the sequence number is random (unpredictable) <xref target="RFC3550"/>.</t>
    <t>	Timestamp (TS):  The timestamp is set to a time corresponding to the repair packet's transmission time.
	Note that the timestamp value has no use in the actual FEC protection process and is usually useful for jitter calculations.
	FEC packets that are the result of the same FEC encoding operation will use the same value as their Timestamp.</t>
    <t>	Synchronization Source (SSRC):  The SSRC value is randomly assigned as suggested by <xref target="RFC3550"/>.</t>

A FEC repair packet MUST contain a Repair FEC Payload ID that is prepended to the
repair symbol(s) as illustrated in <xref target="fig_repair_pkt_format"/>.
More precisely the Repair FEC Payload ID encoding format includes information that enables
the receiver to reconstruct the source block and to identify the FEC repair packets associated

<t>The format of the Repair FEC Payload ID is shown in figure <xref target="fig_repair_fpi_format"/>.
It includes the following fields:
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Encoding Symbol ID, ESI (8-bit field):"> 
	this field identifies the repair symbol contained in this FEC repair packet.
	This value is such that k &le; ESI &le; n - 1 for repair symbols.</t>
<t hangText="SN_base (16-bit field):"> the lowest RTP sequence number (taking wraparound into account) of the FEC source packets
	in the associated source block. This SN_base also identifies the source block.
	In order to avoid any risk of confusion, two consecutive source blocks MUST use different SN_base values, which
	is easily verified by the sender (this situation might happen with Reed-Solomon over GF(2^16)).</t>
<t hangText="Source block length, k (16-bit field):"> the number of consecutive FEC Source Packets considered.</t>
<t hangText="n_r (8-bit field):"> the number of FEC repair packets used to protect this source block.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Though the n_r field is not absolutely required (the maximum number of repair symbols can be deduced
from the finite field parameter, m), it MAY be useful for the receiver to determine if all the
repair packets have been sent (e.g., if n_r FEC repair packets have already been received for this
source block).
However, since the transmission of FEC repair packets is not necessarily reliable nor guaranteed to
preserved packet transmission order, so great care must be taken in figuring out if more FEC repair
packets are expected or not.
The n_r field MAY also be useful to receivers that need to anticipate the memory block that is
required to store all the FEC repair packets.

<section anchor="repair_data_format" title="Repair Symbol Format">
<!-- --------------------------------- -->

<t>The repair symbol follows directly the repair FEC Payload ID in the FEC repair packet
(see figure <xref target="fig_repair_pkt_format"/>).
Note that the first two bytes of a repair symbol contain the result of the Reed-Solomon encoding over 
the packet sizes in the source block.
Therefore, the size of an FEC repair packet (FEC Payload ID and FEC repair symbol) is larger than the
longest source packet (2 bytes longer).
This should be taken under consideration when deciding on the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size used
for the source packets.</t>

<section anchor="mapping_of_SDP_parameters" title="Mapping of SDP Parameters">
<!-- --------------------------------- -->

<t>For a proper operation details of the FEC scheme have to be communicated between the sender and the receiver. 
Specifically, the receiver has to know the relationship between the source and the repair flows, how the sender 
applied protection to the source flow and how the repair flows can be used to recover the lost data. One way to provide 
this information is to use the Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC4566"/>.  </t>
<t>The mapping of the media type specification for "reed-solomon-fec" and their parameters in SDP is as follows:</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
   <t>  The media type (e.g., "application") goes into the "m=" line as
      the media name.</t>

   <t>  The media subtype ("reed-solomon-fec") goes into the "a=rtpmap" line as the encoding
      name.  </t>

   <t>  The remaining required payload-format-specific parameters ("max_n", "repair-window") go into
      the "a=fmtp" line by copying them directly from the media type
      string as a semicolon-separated list of parameter=value pairs.</t>

<section anchor="protection_recovery_procedures"  title="Protection and Recovery Procedures">
<!-- --------------------------------- -->

<t>This section provides a complete specification of the protection and recovery procedures.</t>
<section anchor="overview"  title="Overview">
<t>The FEC repair packets allow end-systems to recover from media packet losses (also called erasures). 
The following sections specify the steps involved in generating the FEC repair packets and reconstructing the
 missing source packets from the FEC repair packets.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="repair_packet_construction"  title="FEC Repair Packet Construction">
<!-- --------------------------------- -->

<t>
The source block is created and encoding is performed based on the guidelines given in <xref target="source_block_creation"/>.
The RTP header of a FEC repair packet is formed based on the guidelines given in <xref target="rtp_header_format"/>.
The repair FEC Payload ID is formed based on the guidelines given in <xref target="repair_fpi_format"/>.
The n_r FEC repair packets can then be sent along with the k original unmodified source packets.
</t>

</section>


<section anchor="source_packet_reconstruction"  title="Source Packet Reconstruction">
<!-- --------------------------------- -->

<t>Recovery requires two distinct operations.
The first operation determines which packets (source and repair) must be considered in order to recover the missing
packets of a given block.
Once this is done, the second step is the reconstruction of the missing data.
</t> 


<section anchor="associating_source_and_repair_packets"  title="Associating the Source and Repair Packets">
<!-- --------------------------------- -->

<t>Association of the FEC source packets and FEC repair packets is done using a combination of the source packet sequence 
number and the information found in the RTP header and the repair FEC Payload ID of the FEC repair packets.
The first step is to accumulate some of the n_r = n - k repair packets that were generated.
For that the application follows the steps listed below:
<list style="symbols">
<t>	For each received packet, retrieve the payload type parameter from the RTP header to identify the packet as a FEC
	repair packet of the Reed-Solomon scheme or a source packet.
	In case multiple repair flows are used, different payload types will be used to distinguish between the different
	repair flows.</t>
<t>	If a FEC repair packet is received, retrieve the sequence number (SN) from the RTP header and the
	ESI, SN_base, k and n_r parameters from the repair FEC Payload ID.
	<list style="symbols">
	<t>	With these parameters, identify the collection of source packets that are included in this source block. 
		For example, if SN_base = 991 and k = 10, the receiver deduces that this source block is composed of
		the 10 source packets with RTP sequence numbers 991 to 1000 (inclusive).</t>
	<t>	With these parameters, identify the collection of FEC repair packets generated for this source block. 
		For example, if SN_base = 991, ESI = 12, k = 10, n_r = 4, the receiver deduces that 4 FEC repair packets
		with RTP sequence numbers 1001, 1002, 1003 and 1004 have been generated for this source block.</t>
	</list></t>
</list>
</t>

</section>


<section anchor="recovering_the_source_packet"  title="Recovering the source packet">
<!-- --------------------------------- -->

<t>In order to recover the lost source packets, the application has to rebuild the source block according to the 
guidelines given in <xref target="source_block_creation"/> and append the repair symbol to it in the correct order. 
Zero padding will replace the lost packets in the constructed source block. The size of each source block data packet in 
bytes will be equal to the size of the repair symbol found in the repair packets.
The repair symbol size is the size of the RTP payload in the repair packet without the repair FEC Payload ID
(see <xref target="fig_repair_pkt_format"/>).
The application will then append the repair symbol taken from each repair packet.
This new block is provided to the Reed-Solomon code.</t>
<t>Reconstruction of lost packets (source or repair packets) is possible only if at least any k packets were received
(source or repair).</t>

<t>The Reed-Solomon code will reconstruct the lost data into the provided source block overriding 
the zero padded blocks. The application can then recover the lost packets as follows:</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>	The first two bytes specify the RTP packet size.</t>
<t>	According to the RTP packet size the application can retrieve the RTP packet (RTP header and payload).</t>
<t>	Any extra padding bytes (if any) are ignored. </t>

    <section anchor="Implementation_considerations" title="Implementation Considerations">
    <!-- --------------------------------- -->

<t>Using Reed-Solomon FEC protection over RTP may be useful for efficiently overcoming network packet losses
in interactive communications where latency constraints apply. 
Protection may be applied for small encoding blocks, and therefore latency caused by waiting for the FEC repair packets is minimized.</t>

<t>This document allows the application to set the FEC recovery capabilities dynamically according to the experienced and measured loss rate, for optimizing bandwidth utilization while recovering from network errors.</t>

<t>When FEC protection is used due to network congestion conditions, it is important that the application will reduce the bandwidth used for FEC protection from the bandwidth used by the source flow, in order not to overload the already congested network with the additional FEC repair packets.</t>	
<t>In order to minimize bandwidth overhead for repair packets, algorithm for applying FEC on source packets should be designed carefully.
Using source packets with similar lengths (when possible) can minimize the bandwidth overhead of the FEC repair packets.</t>

<t>In order to maximize the FEC recovery capabilities, when a ratio of k/n is chosen, the larger the encoding blocks size (n) is, the stronger the FEC protection is. 
Of course, on the other hand the larger the source block size is, the larger the latency is (caused by waiting for the FEC repair packet). 
The application should choose carefully the FEC block size in order to maximize the FEC recovery capabilities while keeping an acceptable latency at the receiver waiting for the FEC repair packets.</t>

<section anchor="sec_security_considerations" title="Security Considerations">
<!-- ==================================== -->

  <section title="Problem Statement">
  <!-- ================ -->

<t>
A content delivery system is potentially subject to many attacks.
Some of them target the network (e.g., to compromise the routing infrastructure,
by compromising the congestion control component), others target
the Content Delivery Protocol (CDP) (e.g., to compromise its normal behavior),
and finally some attacks target the content itself.
Since this document focuses on various FEC schemes, this
section only discusses the additional threats that their use within the
FECFRAME framework can create to an arbitrary CDP.
</t>

<t>
More specifically, these attacks may have several goals:
<list style="symbols">
	<t> those that are meant to give access to a confidential content (e.g., in
	  case of a non-free content),</t>
	<t> those that try to corrupt the ADU Flows being transmitted (e.g., to
	  prevent a receiver from using it),</t>
	<t> and those that try to compromise the receiver's behavior (e.g., by
	  making the decoding of an object computationally expensive).</t>
</list>
These attacks can be launched either against the data flow itself (e.g.,
by sending forged FEC Source/Repair Packets) or against the FEC parameters that are
sent either in-band (e.g., in the Repair FEC Payload ID) or out-of-band (e.g., in
a session description).
</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Attacks Against the Data Flow">
  <!-- ================ -->

<t>
First of all, let us consider the attacks against the data flow.
</t>

	<section title="Access to Confidential Contents">
	<!-- ================ -->

<t>
Access control to the ADU Flow being transmitted is typically provided by means
of encryption.
This encryption can be done within the content provider itself, by the
application (for instance by using the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
<xref target="RFC3711"/>), or at the Network Layer, on a packet per packet basis
when IPsec/ESP is used <xref target="RFC4303"/>.
If confidentiality is a concern, it is RECOMMENDED that one of these solutions be used.
Even if we mention these attacks here, they are not related nor facilitated by
the use of FEC.
</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Content Corruption" anchor="sec_content_corruption">
	<!-- ================ -->

<t>
Protection against corruptions (e.g., after sending forged FEC Source/Repair Packets)
is achieved by means of a content integrity verification/sender authentication scheme.
This service is usually provided at the packet level. In this case, after 
removing all forged packets, the ADU Flow may be sometimes recovered.
Several techniques can provide this source authentication/content integrity
service:
<list style="symbols">
<t>	at the application level, the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
	<xref target="RFC3711"/> provides several solutions to authenticate the source and
	check the integrity of RTP and RTCP messages, among other services.
	For instance, associated to the Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA)
	<xref target="RFC4383"/>, SRTP is an attractive solution that is robust to losses, provides
	a true authentication/integrity service, and does not create any prohibitive processing
	load or transmission overhead.
	Yet, checking a packet requires a small delay (a second or more) after its reception with
	TESLA.
	Other building blocks can be used within SRTP to provide authentication/content
	integrity services.
</t>
<t>	at the Network Layer, IPsec/ESP offers (among other services) an integrity verification
	mechanism that can be used to provide authentication/content integrity services.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Techniques relying on public key cryptography (e.g., digital signatures)
require that public keys be securely associated to the entities.
This can be achieved by a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), or by a
PGP Web of Trust, or by pre-distributing the public keys of each group member.
</t>

<t>
Techniques relying on symmetric key cryptography require that a
secret key be shared by all group members. This can be achieved by means of a
group key management protocol, or simply by pre-distributing the secret key
(but this manual solution has many limitations).
</t>

<t>
It is up to the developer and deployer, who know the security requirements and
features of the target application area, to define which solution is the most appropriate.
Nonetheless it is RECOMMENDED that at least one of these techniques be used.
</t>
	</section>

  </section>

  <section title="Attacks Against the FEC Parameters">
  <!-- ================ -->

<t>
Let us now consider attacks against the FEC parameters included in the FFCI that
are usually sent out-of-band (e.g., in a session description).
Attacks on these FEC parameters can prevent the decoding of the associated object.
For instance modifying the m field (when applicable) will lead a receiver to consider
a different code.
Modifying the E parameter will lead a receiver to consider bad Repair Symbols for
a received FEC Repair Packet.
</t>

<t>
It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures be taken to guarantee the
FFCI integrity.
When the FFCI is sent out-of-band in a session description,
this latter SHOULD be protected, for instance by digitally signing it.
</t>

<t>
Attacks are also possible against some FEC parameters included in the
Explicit Repair FEC Payload ID.
For instance modifying the SN_base of a FEC Repair Packet will lead a receiver
to assign this packet to a wrong block.
</t>

<t>
It is therefore RECOMMENDED that security measures be taken to guarantee the
Explicit Repair FEC Payload ID integrity.
To that purpose, one of the packet-level source authentication/content integrity
techniques of <xref target="sec_content_corruption"/> can be used.
