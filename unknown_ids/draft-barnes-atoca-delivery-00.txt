               Scalable Robust Alerting Protocol (SCRAP)
                   draft-barnes-atoca-delivery-00.txt

Abstract

   Emergency alerts need to be delivered reliably from one source to
   many recipients at once.  TCP is unsuitable for this style of
   delivery, because the large number of acknowledgements would likely
   cause network congestion.  This document defines a UDP-based protocol
   for delivering alerts that supports fragmentation and retransmission
   for reliability, and allows the sender of a datagram to control
   whether acknowledgements are sent.

   Please send feedback to the atoca@ietf.org mailing list.

1.  Introduction

   [TODO]

1.1.  Open Questions

   Should we include hash value in URI format?  Or leave that to the
   metadata/configuration protocol?

   Should we randomize the order in which fragments are transmitted in
   order to deal with correlated loss?


2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Packet Format

   [Sent over UDP.  Default port is XXX.]

   [Payload format: Alert ID (2 octets / 16 bits); Fragment number (1
   octet / 8 bits); Number of fragments in alert (1 octet / 8 bits);
   Alert data (remaining octets)]

   [Content of reassembled packets MUST be an ESCAPE-formatted alert]


4.  URI Format

   [Specifies the format/source of an alert that will be sent]

   [alert-src:[host/IP]:[srcport]?:[dstport]]


5.  Sender Processing

   [Choose an alert ID]

   [Divide payload into fragments that will fit within an MTU]

   [Attach headers to fragments]

   [Transmit fragments in order]

Internet-Draft                   ESCAPE                     October 2011


   [Re-transmit the sequence to deal with loss:]

   [Probability of receipt given loss (p=P(success)), #fragments (F),
   #retransmissions (R), : q = (1 - (1-p)^R)^F]

   [Number of retransmissions given loss (1-p), resilience (q),
   #fragments (F): R = log(1-q^(1/F)) / log(1-p)]


6.  Receiver Processing

   [Maintain a set of alert buffers identified by alert ID (possibly an
   empty set)]

   [Alert buffer contents: alert id; fragments to be received; list of
   fragment numbers; list of fragments]

   [When an alert packet arrives...]

   [If there is a buffer for its ID, add it to the buffer; if the buffer
   is complete, re-assemble, validate ESCAPE, and deliver alert to
   higher layer]

   [If there is not a buffer for its ID, then allocate a new one and add
   the fragment.]

   [If all fragments for an alert do not arrive within T1 milliseconds,
   discard the buffer; default T1=5000]


7.  IANA Considerations

   [Default port number]


8.  Security Considerations

   [This protocol provides no security protections; security provided by
   ESCAPE.]

   [Main concern is DOS, mitigated by buffer timeouts; at worst, have to
   buffer 2^32 octets, if all buffers full for all alert IDs.  MAY
   impose limits on buffer size / number of buffers active
   simultaneously. ]
