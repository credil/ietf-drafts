            Sieve defines an email filtering language that can, in
            principle, plug into any point in the processing of an email
            message.  As defined in the base specification, it plugs into
            mail delivery.  This document defines how Sieve can plug into
            points in the IMAP protocol where messages are created or changed,
            adding the option of user-defined or installation-defined
            filtering (or, with Sieve extensions, features such as notifications).

            <t>
              Some applications have a need to apply <xref target="Sieve"/>
              filters in situations other than initial mail delivery.  This
              is especially true in diverse service environments, such as
              when the client is sporadically connected, is connected through
              a high-latency or high-cost channel, or is on a limited-function
              device.  For such clients, it may be very important, for higher
              performance and reliability, to take advantage of server capabilities,
              including those provided by Sieve filtering (and Sieve extensions,
              such as <xref target="Notify"/>).
            </t>
            <t>
              This specification defines extensions to <xref target="IMAP"/>
              to support the invocation of Sieve scripts at times when the
              IMAP server creates new messages, or modifies existing ones.
              It also defines how Sieve scripts will process these invocations.
              Support for IMAPSieve requires support for <xref target="Metadata"/>
              as well, since the latter is used to associate scripts with IMAP
              mailboxes.
            </t>
            <t>
              <cref>
                General note:
                Sieve was designed to work at final delivery, and makes many assumptions
                about the context.  Will those assumptions break this environment without
                our realizing it fully?
              </cref>
            </t>
            <t>
              <cref>
                Note about identity:
                We might want to use Sieve to impose fine-grained access controls.
                In final delivery, there's no identity for the “filer”.
                Here, there is: the logged-in IMAP user.
                How do we get at that identity?

              "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to

        <section anchor="imapspec" title='The IMAP "IMAPSieve" Extension'>
          <section anchor="capability" title='The "IMAPSieve" Capability String'>
            <t>
              An IMAP server advertises support for this extension through the
              capability string "IMAPSieve" (the string is not case-sensitive,
              and is shown here with this capitalization for readability).
              A server that advertises IMAPSieve is claiming to be in
              compliance with this specification in all aspects.
            </t>
            <t>
              Implementations that support IMAPSieve MUST also support <xref target="Environment"/>,
              because the latter defines an important way for Sieve scripts to test
              the conditions under which they have been invoked.  Notwithstanding this requirement,
              scripts that use IMAPSieve must include BOTH capability strings in their required lists.
            </t>
          </section>
          
          <section anchor="oldfunc" title='Existing IMAP Functions Affected by IMAPSieve'>
            <t>
              The subsections below describe in detail the IMAP commands and
              situations on which IMAPSieve has an effect.
              Not all Sieve actions make sense in the case of messages
              affected by IMAP commands.
              See <xref target="sieveactions"/> for details.
            </t>
            <t>
              It's important to note that since the base Sieve specification (see <xref target="Sieve"/>)
              and its extensions define functions for scripts that are invoked during
              initial mail delivery, those function definitions are necessarily tailored to
              and limited by that context.  This document extends those function definitions
              for use during IMAP events.  By nature of that, Sieve functions, in this
              extended context, may behave somewhat differently, though their extended
              behaviour will still be consistent with the functions' goals.
            </t>
            <t>
              If more than one message is affected at the same time,
              each message triggers the execution of a Sieve script separately.
              The scripts MAY be run in parallel.
            </t>
            
            <section anchor="imapappend" title='The IMAP APPEND Command'>
              <t>
                A message may be added to a mailbox through the IMAP APPEND
                command.  In a server that advertises IMAPSieve, new messages
                added in this way MUST trigger the execution of a Sieve script,
                subject to the settings defined through Metadata
                (see <xref target="metadata-def"/>).
              </t>
            </section>
            
            <section anchor="imapmultiappend" title='The IMAP MULTIAPPEND Command'>
              <t>
                If the IMAP server supports the IMAP <xref target="MultiAppend"/>
                extension, messages may be added to a mailbox through the IMAP MULTIAPPEND
                command.  In a server that advertises IMAPSieve, new messages
                added in this way MUST trigger the execution of a Sieve script,
                as with the APPEND command, also subject to the settings
                defined through Metadata.
              </t>
            </section>
            
            <section anchor="imapcopy" title='The IMAP COPY Command'>
              <t>
                One or more messages may be added to a mailbox through the IMAP COPY
                command.  In a server that advertises IMAPSieve, new messages
                added in this way MUST trigger the execution of a Sieve script,
                subject to the settings defined through Metadata.
              </t>
            </section>

            <section anchor="imapflags" title='Changes to IMAP Message Flags'>
              <t>
                One or more existing messages can have their flags changed
                in a number of ways, including:
                <list style="symbols">
                  <t>The FETCH command (may cause the \Seen flag to be set).</t>
                  <t>The STORE command (may cause the \Answered, \Deleted,
                    \Draft, \Flagged, and \Seen flags to be set or reset,
                    and may cause keywords to be set or reset).</t>
                  <t>The invocation of a Sieve script on an existing message,
                  where the Sieve implementation supports the
                  <xref target="IMAP4Flags"/> extension
                  and the script uses one of the actions defined in that extension.
                  </t>
                </list>
                In a server that advertises IMAPSieve, messages whose flags
                are changed in any way (except as explained in the next sentence)
                MUST trigger the execution of a Sieve script,
                subject to the settings defined through Metadata.
                The exception is that in order to avoid script loops,
                flag changes that are made as a result of a script that was
                itself invoked because of flag changes SHOULD NOT result in
                another script invocation.  In any case, implementations MUST
                take steps to avoid such loops.
              </t>
              <t>
                For flag-change events, the Sieve script will see the message flags
                as they are AFTER the changes.
              </t>
            </section>
            
            <section anchor="imapannotate" title='New or Changed IMAP Message Annotations'>
              <t>
                <cref>
                  Sieve has no way to get the annotations, so is there really value in being
                  told about annotation changes here? Maybe push that into a sieve-annotations
                  extension later.
                </cref>
              </t>
              <t>
                If the IMAP server supports the <xref target="Annotate"/> extension,
                one or more existing messages can have annotations added or changed
                through the ANNOTATE command.
                In a server that advertises IMAPSieve, messages getting new or
                changed annotations MUST trigger the execution of a Sieve script,
                subject to the settings defined through Metadata.
              </t>
              <t>
                For annotation-change events, the Sieve script will see the message annotations
                as they are AFTER the changes.
              </t>
            </section>
          </section>
          
          <section anchor="newfunc" title='New Functions Defined by IMAPSieve'>
            <section anchor="metadata-def" title='Changes to Metadata'>
              <t>
                Support for IMAPSieve requires support for <xref target="Metadata"/>
                as well, since the latter is used to associate scripts with IMAP
                mailboxes.
              </t>
              <t>
                When an applicable event occurs on an IMAP mailbox, if there is an
                IMAP metadata entry named "/IMAPSieve/Script" for the mailbox, that entry
                is used.  If there is not, but there is an IMAP metadata entry named
                "/IMAPSieve/Script" for the server, that entry is used (providing a way
                to define a global script for all mailboxes on a server).  If neither entry
                exists, then no script will be invoked.
              </t>
              <t>
                If an "/IMAPSieve/Script" metadata entry was selected above,
                the shared value of that metadata name (its "value.shared" attribute) MUST
                be the name of the Sieve script that will be invoked in response to
                the IMAP event OR the name of another metadata entry, the name prefixed
                with "metadata:" (such as "metadata:/IMAPSieve/ScriptContents"), that
                contains the actual script in its value.shared attribute.
                Note that only the value.shared attribute is used; any value.priv
                attributes are ignored.
              </t>
              <t>
                This specifies the mechanism for "activating" a script for
                a given mailbox (or for all mailboxes), but does not specify a
                mechanism for creating, storing, or validating the script.  Implementations
                MAY use <xref target="Manage"/> to acomplish this, using the PUTSCRIPT command
                to store the script without using the SETACTIVE command to activate it.
                In any case, the script name that is specified in the /IMAPSieve/Script metadata
                entry is in a form that depends upon how the server handles the storing of
                Sieve scripts.
              </t>
              <t>
                Only one Sieve script may currently be defined per mailbox, eliminating the
                complexity and possible ambiguity involved with coordinating the 
                results of multiple scripts.  Any sub-filtering is done in the 
                Sieve script.  For example, if it's only necessary to deal with
                flag changes, but not with new messages appended or copied, the
                Sieve script will still be invoked for all events, and the script
                is responsible for checking the event type.
              </t>
              <t>
                The possibility is open for an extensions to add support for multiple
                scripts -- for example, per-client scripts on a multi-client user's inbox,
                or per-user scripts on a mailbox that is shared among users.
              </t>
              <t>
                Because this metadata name is associated with the mailbox, 
                there can (and it's expected that there will) be different scripts
                associated with events for different mailboxes.  Indeed, most
                mailboxes will probably invoke no script at all.

        <section anchor="sieveactions" title="Applicable Sieve Actions and Interactions">
          <t>
            Since some Sieve actions relate specifically to the delivery of
            mail, not all actions make sense when the messages are created
            by other means or when changes are made to data associated with
            existing messages.  This section describes how actions in the base
            Sieve specification, and those in extensions known at this writing,
            relate to this specification.
          </t>
          <t>
            In addition to what is specified here, interactions noted
            in the individual specifications apply, and must be considered.
          </t>
          
          <section anchor="action-implicitkeep" title="The Implicit Keep">
            <t>
              For all cases that fall under IMAPSieve, the implicit keep
              means that the message is treated as it would have been if no
              Sieve script were run.  For APPEND, MULTIAPPEND and COPY, the
              message is stored into the target mailbox normally.  For flag
              or annotation changes, the message is left in the mailbox.
            </t>
          </section>
          
          <section anchor="action-keep" title="The Keep Action">
            <t>
              The keep action is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAPSieve.
              Its behaviour is as described for implicit keep, in <xref target="action-implicitkeep"/>.
            </t>
          </section>
          
          <section anchor="action-fileinto" title="The Fileinto Action">
            <t>
              If the Sieve implementation supports the fileinto action,
              that action is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAPSieve.
              If the <xref target="Copy"/> extension is available and
              the :copy option is specified, the implicit keep is retained;
              otherwise, fileinto cancels the implicit keep, as specified in
              the base Sieve specification.
            </t>
            <t>
              For APPEND, MULTIAPPEND, and COPY, the message is stored into the
              fileinto mailbox IN ADDITION TO the original target mailbox.  For flag
              or annotation changes, the message is COPIED into the fileinto mailbox,
              without removing the original.
            </t>
            <t>
              If a keep action is NOT also in effect,

              <cref>
                Redirect assumes message can be submitted as is – not a valid assumption in
                this context.  What do we do if the decision is “redirect” and there's not
                enough information to do it?  Also, some have been concerned about, say,
                a flag change that has the Sieve effect of forwarding the message somewhere.
                Perhaps we should just forbid redirect.
              </cref>
            </t>                     
            <t>
              The redirect action is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAPSieve.
              It causes the message to be sent, as specified in the base Sieve
              specification, to the designated address.
              If the <xref target="Copy"/> extension is available and
              the :copy option is specified, the implicit keep is retained;
              otherwise, redirect cancels the implicit keep, as specified in
              the base Sieve specification.
            </t>
            <t>
              For APPEND, MULTIAPPEND, and COPY, the message is stored into
              the target mailbox in addition to being redirected.  For flag
              or annotation changes, the message remains in its original mailbox.
            </t>
            <t>
              If a keep action is NOT also in effect,
              the original message is then marked with the \Deleted
              flag (and a flag-change Sieve script is NOT invoked).
              The implementation MAY then expunge the original message
              (WITHOUT expunging other messages in the mailbox),
              or it MAY choose to have expunges batched, or done by a user.
              If the server does the expunge, the effect is as though a client had flagged the message and done

              The discard action is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAPSieve.
              For APPEND, MULTIAPPEND, and COPY, the message is first stored
              into the target mailbox.
              If an explicit keep action is also in effect,
              the discard action now does nothing.  Otherwise,
              the original message is then marked with the \Deleted
              flag (and a flag-change Sieve script is NOT invoked).
              The implementation MAY then expunge the original message
              (WITHOUT expunging other messages in the mailbox),

              If the <xref target="Notify"/> extension is available, the

              the message is otherwise handled as it would normally have been.

                Should editheader be allowed to change header fields that aren't saved in place,
                such as for redirect or fileinto?  Editheader would still have to be banned for
                “keep”, but not otherwise.
              </cref>
            </t>                     
            <t>
              Even if the <xref target="EditHeader"/> extension is available,
              since messages in IMAP mailboxes are immutable these actions
              are NOT applicable.  
              Use of these MUST result in an error condition that will terminate the Sieve script.
              Explanation:  Using them for flag or annotation changes
              to existing messages would cause the message to be changed.
              Using them for APPEND, MULTIAPPEND, and COPY would cause unexpected
              differences in the stored copy as compared to what the client
              expected, and would make the client's message cache invalid unexpectedly.

                <cref>                
                  Should this just require imap4flags?  Some implementors have said they
                  wouldn't bother with it without the ability to manipulate flags.
                  And what values of flags does it see -- before or after the change?
                  If it changes them, can it see the originals?
                  Can it reset changes?
                </cref>
              </t>
            <t>
              If the <xref target="IMAP4Flags"/> extension is available,
              the actions associated with it are all applicable to any case that falls under IMAPSieve.
              It is worth noting also that the "hasflag" test that is defined in
              the IMAP4Flags extension might be particularly useful in scripts triggered
              by flag changes ("hasflag" will see the new, changed flags).
              The flag changes behave as though a client had
              made the change.
            </t>
            <t>
              As explained above, in order to avoid script loops
              flag changes that are made as a result of a script that was
              itself invoked because of flag changes SHOULD NOT result in
              another script invocation.  In any case, implementations MUST
              take steps to avoid such loops.

              Implementations MAY invoke different Sieve scripts for the different

              annotation changes).  If the actions to be taken are common, and the

            <t>
              It may be preferable, though, to use a single script for all these

              "cause", which contains the name of the

          <t>
            It is possible to introduce script processing loops by having
            a Sieve script that is triggered by flag changes use the actions
            defined in the <xref target="IMAP4Flags"/> extension.
            Implementations MUST take steps to prevent such loops.
            One way to avoid this problem is that if a script
            is invoked by flag changes, and that script further changes
            the flags, those flag changes SHOULD NOT trigger a Sieve script
            invocation.
