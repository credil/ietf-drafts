    <abstract>
      <t>Many end user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly
      IPv4 internal infrastructures. These sites range in size from small
      home/office networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but share
      the commonality that IPv4 continues to provide satisfactory internal
      routing and addressing services for most applications. As more and more
      IPv6-only services are deployed in the Internet, however, end user
      devices within such sites will increasingly require at least basic IPv6
      functionality for external access. It is also expected that more and
      more IPv6-only devices will be deployed within the site over time. This
      document therefore discusses updates to the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel
      Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) to better accommodate these needs.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>End user sites in the Internet today currently use IPv4 routing and
      addressing internally for core operating functions such as web browsing,
      filesharing, network printing, e-mail, teleconferencing and numerous
      other site-internal networking services. Such sites typically have an
      abundance of public or private IPv4 addresses for internal networking,
      and are separated from the public Internet by firewalls, packet
      filtering gateways, proxies, address translators and other site border
      demarcation devices. To date, such sites have had little incentive to
      enable IPv6 services internally <xref target="RFC1687"></xref>.</t>

      <t>End-user sites that currently use IPv4 services internally come in
      endless sizes and varieties. For example, a home network behind a
      Network Address Translator (NAT) may consist of a single link supporting
      a few laptops, printers etc. As a larger example, a small business may
      consist of one or a few offices with several networks connecting
      considerably larger numbers of computers, routers, handheld devices,
      printers, faxes, etc. Moving further up the scale, large banks,
      restaurants, major retailers, large corporations, etc. may consist of
      hundreds or thousands of branches worldwide that are tied together in a
      complex global enterprise network. Additional examples include
      personal-area networks, mobile vehicular networks, disaster relief
      networks, tactical military networks, and various forms of Mobile Ad-hoc
      Networks (MANETs). These cases and more are discussed in RANGERS<xref
      target="RFC6139"> </xref>.</t>

      <t>With the proliferation of IPv6 devices in the public Internet,
      however, existing IPv4 sites will increasingly require a means for
      enabling IPv6 services so that hosts within the site can communicate
      with IPv6-only correspondents. Such services must be deployable with
      minimal configuration, and in a fashion that will not cause disruptions
      to existing IPv4 services. The Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing
      Protocol (ISATAP) <xref target="RFC5214"></xref> provides a
      simple-to-use service that sites can deploy in the near term to meet
      these requirements, as discussed in <xref
      target="I-D.templin-v6ops-isops"></xref>. However, the ISATAP base
      specification has several fundamental limitations that restrict its
      applicability.</t>

      <t>For example, the base specification does not allow for
      router-to-router tunneling and therefore does not support DHCPv6-based
      address and/or prefix delegation services <xref
      target="RFC3315"></xref><xref target="RFC3633"></xref>. The base
      specification moreover does not permit the assignment of non
      ISATAP-format addresses of any kind to the ISATAP interface. Finally,
      the base specification provides no means for address selection
      preference of IPv4 over ISATAP for communications within the same
      site.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="ISATAP Updates">
      <t>The base ISATAP model supports two basic node types - namely,
      advertising ISATAP routers and ISATAP hosts. Advertising ISATAP routers
      configure their site-facing ISATAP interfaces as advertising router
      interfaces (see: <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>, Section 6.2.2). ISATAP
      hosts configure their site-facing ISATAP interfaces as simple host
      interfaces and also coordinate their autoconfiguration operations with
      advertising ISATAP routers.</t>

      <t>This document introduces a third node type known as "non-advertising
      ISATAP routers". Non-advertising ISATAP routers configure their
      site-facing ISATAP interfaces as non-advertising router interfaces and
      obtain IPv6 addresses/prefixes via autoconfiguration exchanges with
      advertising ISATAP routers. Non-advertising ISATAP routers connect IPv6
      networks to the ISATAP link, and can therefore support a
      router-to-router tunneling mode not permitted under the base
      specification.</t>

      <t>To support this router-to-router tunneling (and also to support the
      assignment of non ISATAP-format addresses on ISATAP interfaces) ISATAP
      nodes add an update to the source address verification checks specified
      in Section 7.3 of <xref target="RFC5214"></xref>. Namely, the node also
      considers the outer IPv4 source address correct for the inner IPv6
      source address if:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>a forwarding table entry exists that lists the packet's IPv4
          source address as the link-layer address corresponding to the inner
          IPv6 source address via the ISATAP interface.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The base ISATAP model further does not specify any IPv6 multicast
      mappings. This precludes the use of services such as DHCPv6 which
      require a link-scoped IPv6 multicasting service. To support DHCPv6
      services, ISATAP hosts and non-advertising ISATAP routers that observe
      this specification map the IPv6 "All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers"
      link-scoped multicast address to the IPv4 address of an advertising
      ISATAP router. Advertising ISATAP routers in turn configure a DHCPv6
      server or relay function, and accept DHCPv6 messages sent by clients
      using this mapping.</t>

      <t>Finally, this document updates the address selection policies of the
      base specification as follows. For communications between two nodes
      whose IPv6 addresses are covered by the same IPv6 prefix advertised in
      Router Advertisements (RAs) on an ISATAP interface, prefer IPv4 over
      IPv6 if the L bit in the Prefix Information Option (PIO) is set to
      0.</t>

      <t>Using these updates, a much richer ISATAP service model is possible
      as discussed in the following sections.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Services">
      <t>Whether or not advertising ISATAP routers make stateless IPv6
      services available using StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC),
      they can also provide managed IPv6 services to ISATAP clients (i.e.,
      both hosts and non-advertising ISATAP routers) using DHCPv6. Any
      addresses/prefixes obtained via DHCPv6 are distinct from any IPv6
      prefixes advertised on the ISATAP interface for SLAAC purposes, however.
      In this way, DHCPv6 addresses/prefixes are reached by viewing the ISATAP
      tunnel interface as a "transit" rather than viewing it as an ordinary
      IPv6 host interface. In contrast to the shared prefix and individual
      prefix models described in <xref
      target="I-D.templin-v6ops-isops"></xref>, we refer to this as the "no
      prefix" model.</t>

      <t>The following sections discuss operational considerations for
      enabling ISATAP DHCPv6 services within predominantly IPv4 sites.</t>

      <section anchor="router-dhcpv6"
               title="Advertising ISATAP Router Behavior">
        <t>Advertising ISATAP routers that support DHCPv6 services send RA
        messages in response to Router Solicitation (RS) messages received on
        an advertising ISATAP interface. Advertising ISATAP routers also
        configure either a DHCPv6 relay or server function to service DHCPv6
        requests received from ISATAP clients.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="host-dhcpv6" title="ISATAP Host Behavior">
        <t>ISATAP hosts send RS messages to obtain RA messages from an
        advertising ISATAP router. Whether or not IPv6 prefixes for SLAAC are
        advertised, the host can acquire IPv6 addresses, e.g., through the use
        of DHCPv6 stateful address autoconfiguration <xref
        target="RFC3315"></xref>. To acquire addresses, the host performs
        standard DHCPv6 exchanges while mapping the IPv6
        "All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers" link-scoped multicast address to
        the IPv4 address of an advertising ISATAP router.</t>

        <t>After the host receives IPv6 addresses, it assigns them to its
        ISATAP interface and forwards any of its outbound IPv6 packets via the
        advertising router as a default router. The advertising router in turn
        maintains IPv6 forwarding table entries that list the IPv4 address of
        the host as the link-layer address of the delegated IPv6 addresses.
        Note that IPv6 addresses acquired from DHCPv6 therefore need not be
        ISATAP addresses, i.e., even though the addresses are assigned to the
        ISATAP interface.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="non-router-dhcpv6"
               title="Non-Advertising ISATAP Router Behavior">
        <t>Non-advertising ISATAP routers can acquire IPv6 prefixes, e.g.,
        through the use of DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation <xref
        target="RFC3633"></xref> via an advertising router in the same fashion
        as described for host-based DHCPv6 stateful address autoconfiguration
        in <xref target="host-dhcpv6"></xref>. The advertising router in turn
        maintains IPv6 forwarding table entries that list the IPv4 address of
        the non-advertising router as the link-layer address of the next hop
        toward the delegated IPv6 prefixes.</t>

        <t>In many use case scenarios (e.g., small enterprise networks,
        MANETs, etc.), advertising and non-advertising ISATAP routers can
        engage in a proactive dynamic IPv6 routing protocol (e.g., OSPFv3,
        RIPng, etc.) over their ISATAP interfaces so that IPv6
        routing/forwarding tables can be populated and standard IPv6
        forwarding between ISATAP routers can be used. In other scenarios
        (e.g., large enterprise networks, highly mobile MANETs, etc.), this
        might be impractical dues to scaling issues. When a proactive dynamic
        routing protocol cannot be used, non-advertising ISATAP routers send
        RS messages to obtain RA messages from an advertising ISATAP router,
        i.e., they act as "hosts" on their non-advertising ISATAP
        interfaces.</t>

        <t>After the non-advertising ISATAP router acquires IPv6 prefixes, it
        can sub-delegate them to routers and links within its attached IPv6
        edge networks, then can forward any outbound IPv6 packets coming from
        its edge networks via other ISATAP nodes on the link.</t>

        <t>In <xref target="no-onlink-prefix-fig"></xref>, advertising ISATAP
        routers 'A' and 'B' within the IPv4 site connect to the IPv6 Internet
        via a companion gateway. (Note that the routers may instead connect to
        the IPv6 Internet directly as shown in <xref
        target="I-D.templin-v6ops-isops"></xref>. For the purpose of this
        example, we also assume that the IPv4 site is configured within a
        single IPv4 subnet.</t>

        <t>Advertising ISATAP routers 'A' and 'B' both configure the IPv4
        anycast address 192.0.2.1 on a site-interior IPv4 interface, and
        configure an advertising ISATAP interface with link-local ISATAP
        address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.1. The site administrator then places the
        single IPv4 address 192.0.2.1 in the Potential Router List (PRL) for
        the site. 'A' and 'B' then both advertise the anycast address/prefix
        into the site's IPv4 routing system so that ISATAP clients can locate
        the router that is topologically closest. (Note: advertising ISATAP
        routers can instead use individual IPv4 unicast addresses instead of a
        shared IPv4 anycast address. In that case, the PRL will contain
        multiple IPv4 addresses of advertising routers.)</t>

        <t>Non-advertising ISATAP router 'C' connects to one or more IPv6 edge
        networks and also connects to the site via an IPv4 interface with
        address 192.0.2.4, but it does not advertise the site's IPv4 anycast
        address/prefix. 'C' next configures a non-advertising ISATAP router
        interface with link-local ISATAP address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.4, then
        discovers router 'A' via an IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulated RS/RA exchange.
        'C' next receives the IPv6 prefix 2001:db8:0::/48 through a DHCPv6
        prefix delegation exchange via 'A', then engages in an IPv6 routing
        protocol over its ISATAP interface and announces the delegated IPv6
        prefix. 'C' finally sub-delegates the prefix to its attached edge
        networks, where IPv6 host 'D' autoconfigures the address
        2001:db8:0::1.</t>

        <t>Non-advertising ISATAP router 'E' connects to the site, configures
        its ISATAP interface, performs an RS/RA exchange, receives a DHCPv6
        prefix delegation, and engages in the IPv6 routing protocol the same
        as for 'C'. In particular, 'E' configures the IPv4 address 192.0.2.5
        and the link-local ISATAP address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.5. 'E' then
        receives the delegated IPv6 prefix 2001:db8:1::/48 and sub-delegates
        the prefix to its attached edge networks, where IPv6 host 'F'
        autoconfigures IPv6 address 2001:db8:1::1.</t>

        <t>ISATAP host 'G' connects to the site via an IPv4 interface with
        address 192.0.2.6, and also configures an ISATAP host interface with
        link-local ISATAP address fe80::5efe:192.0.2.6 over the IPv4
        interface. 'G' next performs an anycast RS/RA exchange to discover 'B"
        and configure a default IPv6 route with next-hop address
        fe80::5efe:192.0.2.1. 'G' then receives the IPv6 address 2001:db8:2::1
        from a DHCPv6 address configuration exchange via 'B'; it then assigns
        the address to the ISATAP interface but does not assign a
        non-link-local IPv6 prefix to the interface.</t>

        <t>Finally, IPv6 host 'H' connects to an IPv6 network outside of the
        ISATAP domain. 'H' configures its IPv6 interface in a manner specific
        to its attached IPv6 link, and autoconfigures the IPv6 address
        2001:db8:3::1.</t>

        <t>Following this autoconfiguration, when host 'D' has an IPv6 packet
        to send to host 'F', it prepares the packet with source address
        2001:db8:0::1 and destination address 2001:db8:1::1, then sends the
        packet into the edge network where IPv6 forwarding will eventually
        convey it to router 'C'. 'C' then uses IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation to
        forward the packet to router 'E', since it has discovered a route to
        2001:db8:1::/48 with next hop 'E' via dynamic routing over the ISATAP
        interface. Router 'E' finally sends the packet into the edge network
        where IPv6 forwarding will eventually convey it to host 'F'.</t>

        <t>In a second scenario, when 'D' has a packet to send to ISATAP host
        'G', it prepares the packet with source address 2001:db8:0::1 and
        destination address 2001:db8:2::1, then sends the packet into the edge
        network where it will eventually be forwarded to router 'C' the same
        as above. 'C' then uses IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation to forward the
        packet to router 'A' (i.e., 'C's default router), which in turn
        forwards the packet to 'G'. Note that this operation entails two hops
        across the ISATAP link (i.e., one from 'C' to 'A', and a second from
        'A' to 'G'). If 'G' also participates in the dynamic IPv6 routing
        protocol, however, 'C' could instead forward the packet directly to
        'G' without involving 'A'.</t>

        <t>In a third scenario, when 'D' has a packet to send to host 'H' in
        the IPv6 Internet, the packet is forwarded to 'C' the same as above.
        'C' then forwards the packet to 'A', which forwards the packet into
        the IPv6 Internet.</t>

        <t>In a final scenario, when 'G' has a packet to send to host 'H' in
        the IPv6 Internet, the packet is forwarded directly to 'B', which
        forwards the packet into the IPv6 Internet.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="DHCPv6 Site Administration Guidance">
        <t>Site administrators configure advertising ISATAP routers that also
        support the DHCPv6 relay/server function to send RA messages with the
        M flag set to 1 as an indication to clients that the stateful DHCPv6
        address autoconfiguration services area available. If stateless DHCPv6
        services are also available, the RA messages also set the O flag to
        1.</t>

        <t>Gateways and packet filtering devices of various forms are often
        deployed in order to divide the site into separate partitions.
        Although the purely DHCPv6 model does not involve the advertisement of
        non-link-local IPv6 prefixes on ISATAP interfaces, alignment of IPv6
        prefixes used for DHCPv6 address assignment with IPv4 site partitions
        is still recommended so that ISATAP clients can prefer native IPv4
        communications over ISATAP IPv6 services for correspondents within
        their contiguous IPv4 partition.</t>

        <t>For example, if the site is assigned the aggregate prefix
        2001:db8:0::/48, then the site administrators can assign the
        more-specific prefixes 2001:db8:0:0::/64, 2001:db8:0:1::/64,
        2001:db8:0:2::/64, etc. to the different IPv4 partitions within the
        site. The administrators can then institute a policy that prefers
        native IPv4 addresses for communications between clients covered by
        the same /64 prefix.</t>

        <t>Site administrators can implement this policy implicitly by
        configuring advertising ISATAP routers to advertise each /64 prefix
        with both the A and L flags set to 0 as an indication that IPv4 should
        be preferred over IPv6 destinations that configure addresses from the
        same prefix. Site administrators can instead (or in addition)
        implement address selection policy rules <xref
        target="RFC3484"></xref> through explicit configurations in each
        ISATAP client.</t>

        <t>For example, each ISATAP client associated with the prefix
        2001:db8:0:0::/64 can add the prefix to its address selection policy
        table with a lower precedence than the prefix ::ffff:0:0/96. In this
        way, IPv4 addresses are preferred over IPv6 addresses from within the
        same /64 prefix. The prefix could be added to each ISATAP client
        either manually, or through an automated service such as a DHCP option
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-opt"></xref>. In this way,
        clients will use IPv4 communications to reach correspondents within
        the same IPv4 site partition, and will use IPv6 communications to
        reach correspondents in other partitions and/or outside of the
        site.</t>

        <t>Finally, site administrators should configure ISATAP routers to not
        send ICMPv6 Redirect messages to inform a source client of a better
        next hop toward the destination unless there is strong assurance that
        the client and the next hop are within the same IPv4 site partition
        (see Section 4.6 for further considerations).</t>

      <section anchor="predirect" title="On-Demand Dynamic Routing for DHCP">
        <t>With respect to the reference operational scenarios depicted in
        <xref target="no-onlink-prefix-fig"></xref>, there may be use cases in
        which a proactive dynamic IPv6 routing protocol cannot be used. For
        example, in large enterprise network deployments it would be
        impractical for all ISATAP routers to engage in a common routing
        protocol instance due to scaling considerations.</t>

        <t>In those cases, an on-demand routing capability can be enabled in
        which ISATAP nodes send initial packets via an advertising ISATAP
        router and receive redirection messages back. For example, when a
        non-advertising ISATAP router 'C' has a packet to send to a host
        located behind non-advertising ISATAP router 'E', it can send the
        initial packets via advertising router 'A' which will return
        redirection messages to inform 'C' that 'E' is a better first hop.
        Protocol details for this redirection procedure (including a means for
        detecting whether the direct path is usable) are specified in <xref
        target="I-D.templin-aero"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="loopavoid-dhcp" title="Loop Avoidance">
        <t>In a purely DHCPv6-based ISATAP deployment, no non-link-local IPv6
        prefixes are assigned to ISATAP router interfaces. Therefore, an
        ISATAP router cannot mistake another router for an ISATAP host due to
        an address that matches an on-link prefix. This corresponds to the
        mitigation documented in Section 3.2.4 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-tunnel-loops"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Any routing loops introduced in the DHCPv6 scenario would therefore
        be due to a misconfiguration in IPv6 routing the same as for any IPv6
        router, and hence are out of scope for this document.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Manual Configuration">
      <t>In addition to any SLAAC services and DHCPv6 services, site
      administrators can use manual configuration to assign non-ISATAP IPv6
      addresses to the ISATAP interfaces of client end systems. Site
      administrators can also use manual configuration to delegate IPv6
      prefixes to non-advertising ISATAP routers instead of (or in addition
      to) using DHCPv6 prefix delegation.</t>

      <t>The IPv6 prefixes used for manual configuration must be distinct from
      any prefixes used for SLAAC, however they may overlap with the prefixes
      used for DHCPv6 as long as there is administrative assurance that the
      same IPv6 addresses/prefixes will not be delegated by both DHCPv6 and
      manual configuration. The manual configuration scenarios and routing
      considerations are otherwise the same as discussed for DHCPv6 in Section
      4.</t>

      <t>When manually configured IPv6 addresses/prefixes are used, the
      prefixes must be covered by a shorter IPv6 prefix advertised into the
      IPv6 routing system by one or more advertising ISATAP routers. The
      advertising routers must further maintain forwarding table entries that
      associate the addresses/prefixes with the ISATAP clients to which the
      addresses/prefixes are delegated, i.e., the same as for DHCPv6.</t>
