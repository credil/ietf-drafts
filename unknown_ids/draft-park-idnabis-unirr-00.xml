    <abstract>
      <t>
	  Although Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) contributes the population of 
	  the Internationalized Domains, it forces human DNS managers to handle unreadable DNS records. 
	  In order to enable human managers to easily edit or modify DNS records, DNS servers should allow 
	  Unicode resource records. This document defines the formats of DNS Resource Records and 
	  a translation process that supports Unicode Resource Records without ruining the interoperability 
	  with existing DNS infrastructure.
	  </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	  Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) [RFC3490] <xref target="RFC3490"/> has applications 
	  use an "ACE label" (ACE stands for ASCII Compatible Encoding) to represent an Internationalized Domain Names (IDN). 
	  The main advantage of IDNA is that lower-layer protocols need not be aware of the existence of IDNA. 
	  For the reason, IDNA is widely accepted where IDN is needed, especially Web browsers. 
	  Though it does not require any changes of existing DNS actors including DNS servers, resolvers, 
	  and protocol elements, it demands the use of ACE label in DNS database. Since an ACE label is difficult 
	  for human to read or infer, human managers cannot directly edit DNS database and cannot easily 
	  examine the validness of DNS records.
	  </t>

      <t> In order to use a Unicode label instead of an ACE label in the DNS 
      database, several technical factors should be considered. First, the types 
      of DNS Resource Records should be decided. Some types are not adequate to 
      hold Unicode <xref target="UNICODE"/> label due to the interoperability with other DNS standards. 
      Second, a translation process of DNS server that does not hurt the 
      interoperability with IDNA should be considered. By inserting a thin 
      translation process between DNS database and DNS protocols, the support of 
      Unicode Resource Records is possible while maintaining the 
      interoperability. </t>

    </section>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
        </t>
 	<t>
 	<xref target="UNICODE">Unicode</xref> is a coded character set containing tens of
   thousands of characters.  A single Unicode code point is denoted by
   "U+" followed by four to six hexadecimal digits, while a range of
   Unicode code points is denoted by two hexadecimal numbers separated
   by "..", with no prefixes.
	</t>   
	<t>   A label is an individual part of a domain name.  Labels are usually
   shown separated by dots; for example, the domain name
   "www.example.com" is composed of three labels: "www", "example", and
   "com".  (The zero-length root label described in [STD13], which can
   be explicit as in "www.example.com." or implicit as in
   "www.example.com", is not considered a label in this specification.)
   IDNA extends the set of usable characters in labels that are text.
   For the rest of this document, the term "label" is shorthand for
   "text label", and "every label" means "every text label".
   </t>
   
   <t>
   An ACE label is an internationalized label
   that can be rendered in ASCII and is equivalent to an
   internationalized label that cannot be rendered in ASCII.
   </t>
      </section>

    <section title="Problem Statements">

      <section title="Applicable types of DNS Resource Records"> 
      <t> A large 
      number of Resource Records have been defined over the 25 years of the DNS 
      specification. However, applicable types are restricted due to not all 
      Resource Records can hold IDN data. The applicable types can be grouped 
      with the purpose of administrative and host information. 
      </t>
      
      <section title="Administrative Resource Records"> 
      <t> SOA, NS, and MX 
      Resource Records are defined for the administrative purpose. SOA Resource 
      Record describes the global characteristics of the zone. NS Resource 
      Record defines name servers that are authoritative for the zone. MX 
      Resource Record defines the mail servers for the zone. These Resource 
      Records are in close connection with other standards and this document does not 
      have any intention to update the existing standards so IDNA standard does. 
      Unless the related standards are revised to invite the use of IDNA, these 
      Resource Records SHOULD NOT be the target of this standard. </t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Host Information Resource Records"> <t> A, CNAME, PTR, and 
      AAAA Resource Records are defined for holding host information of the 
      zone. A and AAAA Resource Records are used to indicate IPv4 and IPv6 
      address for the target domain name respectively. CNAME Resource Record is 
      used to allows one host be defined as the alias name for another host. PTR 
      Resource Record stands for resolving IP address into host name.
      </t> 
      </section>      
      </section>

      <section title="Translation Process"> 
      <t>An ACE-encoded Resource Record is 
      necessary to support the interoperability of existing DNS standards, but 
      human mangers suffer for handling it. In order to resolve this issue, DNS 
      Resource Records should be written with Unicode characters. However, this 
      approach will conflict existing DNS infrastructure. To avoid this 
      conflict, a DNS server should translate an ACE-encoded Resource Record in 
      a DNS query packet into a Unicode Resource Record. Reversely, it should 
      also translate a Unicode Resource Record into an ACE-encoded Resource 
      Record in a DNS answer packet. By adopting this translation process into a 
      DNS server, human managers can freely use Unicode Resource Records while 
      maintaining the interoperability with IDNA. </t>

    <section title="DNS Resource Records">

      <section title="A Resource Record"> 
      <t> In A Resource Record, the name field of host name MAY be written with 
      Unicode character strings. 'hangang'{U+D55C U+AC15} 
      represents Han River in Seoul, Korea. Actually, {U+D55C U+AC15} will be replaced with 
      the corresponding Korean characters in DNS Resource Record. A sample record is as below.

      MAY be written with Unicode character strings. A sample record is as below. 
      'Arisoo'{U+C544 U+B9AC U+C218} represents the ancient name of Han River.

    <section title="Translation Process">
    <t>
	When a Unicode-supporting DNS server receives a DNS query packet having 
	an ACE-encoded Resource Record, the server extracts the Resource Record from the packet and translates 
	it into the corresponding Unicode Resource Record. The converted Unicode Resource Record 
	is used to find the matching host information in the DNS database. If the server finds 
	the matching data, it makes a DNS answer packet containing an ACE-encoded Resource Record 
	converted from the matching Unicode Resource Record.
