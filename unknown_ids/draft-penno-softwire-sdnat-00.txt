Internet-Draft         Stateless Deterministic NAT          October 2011


1.  Introduction

   NAT444 and DS-Lite [RFC6333],are two solutions to deal with the IPv4
   exhaustion problem.  NAT444 solves it by introducing a second layer
   of NAT in the ISP network.  DS-Lite solves it by decoupling the
   deployment of IPv6 in the access network from the deployment of IPv6
   in the applications.  DS-Lite is based on a combination of IPv4 over
   IPv6 encapsulation and a carrier grade NAT (CGN).

   There have been a number of efforts at IETF to evolve the DS-Lite
   model by moving the NAT function from a centralized, stateful carrier
   grade NAT to the CPEs by allocating a fixed number of ports to each
   customer.  The provider equipment would then only do the
   decapsulation of the IPv4 traffic, providing a stateless operation
   model, where a number of those relay devices could be operated
   independently in the ISP network.  One drawback of such design, is
   that the service provider looses some flexibility on how ports are
   allocated.  In particular, The IPv6 and global IPv4 address spaces
   are mapped to each over, making it difficult for an ISP to add or
   remove addresses from the NAT pool.  Another drawback is that the
   number of IPv4 port allocated per subscriber is encoded in the IPv6
   address.  This results in a renumbering event when the ISP want to
   change the IPv4 oversubscription ratio.

   Another direction has been to define a deterministic operation model
   for NAT444 CGNs, where ports are statically distributed to users on
   that CGN.  A deterministic mapping function is defined to convert an
   internal address to an external address and port range.  This mapping
   function is reversible, eliminating the need to keep logs for abuse/
   LEA purpose.  However, such a deterministic NAT still need to
   maintain per connection state and as such is not stateless.

   This proposal enhance the deterministic NAT model.  By offering a
   fully programmatic mapping of the complete NAT binding, it enables a
   carrier-grade NAT/ AFTR to become completely stateless and
   deterministic.  This model of operation applies similarly to DS-Lite
   and NAT444 environments.

   By leveraging this stateless and deterministic mode of operation, an
   ISP can deploy any number of SD-CGNs/SD-AFTRs to provide redundancy
   and scalability at low cost.  Because the NAT mappings on the CGNs or
   AFTRs are fully stateless and deterministic, routers can implement
   the functionality in hardware and perform it at very high speed with
   very low overhead in terms of packet delay.

   The SD-NAT CPE remains a simple NAT router.  Its WAN interface can be
   configured either with IPv6 and a B4 element to do IPv4 over IPv6
   encapsulation or with a private unique IPv4 address.  The only change

   required is on the algorithm used to select an outgoing port in the
   NAT function.

   Another important aspect of SD-NAT is that CPEs do not need to learn
   any special configuration.  This allows the ISP to modify at will its
   NAT environment, adding or removing resources from the NAT pool or
   changing the number of ports per user without having to reconfigure
   or renumber the CPEs.


2.  SD-CPE operation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   An SD-CPE operates like a regular CPE with some modification on the
   way the NAT function is performed.

2.1.  SD-CPE NAT function

   The SD-CPE performs IPv4 NAPT from the internal RFC1918 addresses to
   the IPv4 address configured on the WAN interface.  In a DS-Lite
   environment, the B4 address 192.0.0.2 is used in lieu of the IPv4 WAN
   interface.

2.2.  SD-CPE port translation function

   Internal IPv4 source ports are translated into the range
   [1024..65635].  The outgoing ports MUST be allocated sequentially by
   the SD-CPE.

   When the SD-CPE needs to allocate a new external port, it MUST start
   from 1024 and increment until it finds an un-allocated port.

   The first key design element here is that the SD-CGN or SD-AFTR can
   make the assumption that all datagrams coming from the SD-CPE will
   have source ports formatted in a well-known range.  This will make
   the stateless deterministic NAT function on the SD-CGN or SD-AFTR
   easy to implement.

   The second key design element is that the SD-CPE does not need to
   know how many ports are reserved for its usage on the SD-CGN or SD-
   AFTR.  If the SD-CPE allocates a port number that is too high and
   does not fit into the range allocated on the SD-CGN or SD-AFTR, the
   outgoing packet will be dropped by the SD-CGN or SD-AFTR and an ICMP
   [RFC0792] message type 13 (Communication administratively prohibited)
   MAY be returned to the SD-CPE.  That design element allows for a

   great flexibility on the ISP side, the maximum number of ports per
   subscriber can be changed at any time without impacting the
   subscriber.

   A third key design element is that the SD-CPE does not need to know
   which external IPv4 address it will be mapped to.  That design
   element allows for a great flexibility on the ISP side, the pool of
   global IPv4 addresses on the SD-CGNs or SD-AFTRs can be changed at
   any time with little impact on the subscriber.  The subscriber
   configuration will not have to change, the SD-CPE will not have to
   renumber or reboot, however the current connections may or may not
   survive depending on the pool update mechanism implemented on the SD-
   CGNs / SD-AFTRs.

   Note: if the SD-CPE is running its own applications sourcing
   datagrams on its WAN interface (or B4 element 192.0.0.2), it must
   select a source port using the same algorithm as the NAPT function.


3.  SD-CGN and SD-AFTR operation

3.1.  Anycast IPv6 address for SD-AFTR

   All SD-AFTRs associated to a domain (or group of users) will be
   configured with the same IPv6 address on the interface facing IPv6
   customers.  A route for that IPv6 address will be anycasted within
   the access network.  Anycast IPv4 address for SD-CGN Similarly, in
   the NAT444 environment, the IPv4 traffic will be anycasted to a
   number of SD-CGNs.

3.2.  SD-CGN and SD-AFTR operation

   All SD-CGNs or SD-AFTRs associated to a domain (or group of users)
   will be configured with the same pool of global IPv4 addresses.  They
   will be configured also with the same deterministic address and port
   mapping function.  This function will map the customer ID, derived
   from either its private IPv4 address in the NAT444 case or its IPv6
   address in the DS-Lite case and the source port used by the incoming
   connection into a global IPv4 address and port.

3.3.  Mapping function

   Various mapping functions can be defined.  This is an implementation
   issue on the SD-CGNs or SD-AFTRs, however that function MUST be the
   same on all the SD-CGNs or SD-AFTRs within a domain.

   The input parameters of that mapping function are the number of
   addresses in the IPv4 global pool, the number of customers and the



Durand & Penno           Expires April 27, 2012                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         Stateless Deterministic NAT          October 2011


   maximum number of ports per customers.

   Note: external ports in the range of [0..1023] MAY be excluded in the
   mapping function , however this is not a requirement.

3.4.  Example mapping function

   Lets say that all external ports above 1023 are used and a 1000 ports
   are allocated per subscriber, and only one IPv4 address is configured
   in the NAT pool.  Customer #1 will have external ports 1024 to 2023,
   customer #2 will have external ports 2024 to 3023, etc...

   Here is an algorithm that produces this result:

   Input variables:

   o  i: subscriber index

   o  maxPort: maximum number of ports per subscriber

   o  baseCPE:CPE address base, determined by Service Provider, e.g.
      172.16.0.1

   o  baseCGN:CGN address base, determined by Service Provider e.g.
      1.2.3.1.

   Each SD-CPE implements a stateful NAT44 function with the following
   mappings:

   o  host_src_ip is mapped to: CPE WAN IPv4.

   o  host_src_port is mapped to: port, Where port is the first
      available port starting at 1024.

   Each SD-CGN/SD-AFTR implements a deterministic stateless NAT44
   function with following mappings:

      cpe_src_ip is mapped to: baseCGN + floor ( i / P)

      cpe_src_port is mapped to: cpe_src_port + maxPort x (i mod P) )

      Where i = cpe_src_ip - baseCPE and P = floor ( (65536-1024) /
      maxPort )

Internet-Draft         Stateless Deterministic NAT          October 2011


3.5.  Port exceeded message

   If the SD-CGN or SD-AFTR receives an incoming datagram with a source
   port number higher than1023 + the maximum number of allocated ports
   per customer, the datagram MUST be dropped and an ICMP [RFC0792]
   error message type 13 (Communication administratively prohibited) MAY
   be returned to the originating SD-CPE.

3.6.  Address compression ratio

   The maximum number of subscriber per IPv4 address is equal to (65536
   minus 1024) divided by the number of ports per user, as configured on
   the SD-CGN or SD-AFTR.

3.7.  Anycast IPv4 pool

   Routes to the pool of global IPv4 addresses configured on the SD-CGN
   or SD-AFTR will be anycasted by all relevant SD-CGN or SD-AFTRs
   within the ISP routing domain.

3.8.  Stateless operation

   That way, return IPv4 traffic can go back to any SD-CGN or SD-AFTR
   associated with that pool of address.  Because the mapping function
   is deterministic (shared on all AFTRs) and because there is no
   dynamic state associated with any particular NAT mappings on any SD-
   CGN or SD-AFTR, the returning IPv4 traffic can be translated back,
   re-encapsulated in IPv6 in the case of DS-Lite, and send back to the
   customer by any SD-CGN or SD-AFTRs within the domain

   No need to do port mapping garbage collection on SD-CGN/SD-AFTR

   Because those bindings are completely stateless and deterministic, an
   SD-CGN or SD-AFTR does not need to maintain state in its port-mapping
   table, and as such, does not need to perform any garbage collection
   on idle connections.  From a subscriber application perspective, that
   mean that the application only need to negotiate ports with the local
   SD-CPE, for example using the PCP protocol.

3.9.  SD-AFTR stateless domain

   Using the DHCPv6 DS-Lite tunnel-end-point option, groups of
   subscribers and can be associated to a different SD-AFTR domain.
   That can allow for differentiated level of services, e.g. number of
   ports per customer device, QoS, bandwidth, value added services,...

Internet-Draft         Stateless Deterministic NAT          October 2011


3.10.  Premium customers

   Premium customers can be allocated a full global IPv4 address, using
   the exact same mechanism as described above.  The maximum number of
   ports per user is then simply set to 65536 minus 1024.

   An alternative architecture is to allocate a global IPv4 address by
   DHCPv4, either natively over IPv4 or over the IPv6 softwire, to the
   SD-CPE.  That SD-CPE then acts as a regular home NAT.  In the DS-Lite
   case, it sends the translated IPv4 packets, encapsulated over IPv6,
   to the SD-AFTR.


4.  SD-NAT 444 example

   This examples assume two SD-CGNs or two SD-AFTRs configured with the
   same IPv4 global address in their NAT pool.  The operator has
   configured a limit of 1000 ports per subscriber.  Subscriber #3 has 2
   hosts, each running one connection and subscriber #7 has one host
   running one connection.  Subscriber #3 SD-CPE WAN IPv4 address is
   172.16.0.3 in case of NAT444 or WAN IPv6 address 2001:db8::3 in case
   of DS-LITE.  Subscriber #7 WAN IPv4 address is 172.16.0.7 in case of
   NAT444 or WANT IPv6 address 2001:db8::7 in case of DS-LITE.  Host 1
   and 2 in subscriber #3 network are using IPv4 address 192.168.1.2 and
   192.168.1.3, and host 1 in subscriber #7 network is using IPv4
   address 192.168.1.2.

   connection.  Subscriber #3 SD-CPE WAN IPv6 address is 2001:db8::3.
   Subscriber #7 WAN IPv6 address is 2001:db8::7.  Both SD-CPE use the
   same B4 address 192.0.02, as specified in DS-Lite.  Host 1 and 2 in
   subscriber #3 network are using IPv4 address 192.168.1.2 and
   192.168.1.3, and host 1 in subscriber #7 network is using IPv4
   address 192.168.1.2.

6.  Comparison with other techniques

6.1.  Comparison with DS-Lite and NAT444 CGN

   The trade-off of this stateless deterministic model of operation is
   efficiency in IPv4 address sharing.  A typical DS-Lite or NAT444
   environment can share an IPv4 address among over 1000 customers, if
   the ratio of maximum number of port used by any given subscriber to
   the maximum average number of ports used by all subscribers is high.
   A typical SD-DS-Lite or SD-NAT444 environment will share the same
   address among only about 100 subscribers, using a maximum number of
   ports per subscribers of 600.

6.2.  Comparison with 4rd/4via6/A+P/DIVI

   The main difference with 4rd/A+P/4via6/DIVI techniques is that the
   CPE is unaware of the exact port distribution algorithm.  That way,
   the ISP maintains the flexibility to change the numbers of ports
   allocated per subscriber, or add/delete/modify the pool of available
   global IPv4 addresses at any time without creating a customer outage.

   SD-DS-Lite is based on encapsulation, 4via6 and DIVI are based on
   double translation IPv4 to IPv6 and back to IPv4.  Service providers
   have deployed encapsulation techniques for many years, double
   translation is new and there is less operational experience with it.

   An SD-CPE sends packets through a set of identified devices, the SD-
   CGNs or SD-AFTRs.  This enables simple enforcement points to do IPv4
   subscriber management (e.g. counting IPv4 traffic).  A consequence of
   that architecture in the SD-DS-Lite model is that is does not allow
   for 4rd style shortcuts, where traffic between customers within the
   same domain does not go through the relay.


7.  IANA Considerations

   None.


8.  Security Considerations

   As described in [RFC6269], with any fixed size address sharing
   techniques, port randomization is achieve with a smaller entropy.

   Recommendations listed in [RFC6302] applies.
