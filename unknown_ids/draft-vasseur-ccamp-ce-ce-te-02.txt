Abstract

   This document proposes MP-BGP protocol extension so as to convey
   Traffic Engineering Link characterictics of PE (Provider Edge) - CE
   (Customer Edge) links in order to extend the visibility of the
   Traffic Engineering Database to those links.  This can then be used
   to more efficiently compute CE-to-CE Traffic Engineering Label

   MPLS Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP).

   In Multiprotocol Label Switching Virtual Private Network (MPLS VPN)
   enabled networks ([[RFC4364]), IP connectivity is provided to
   customers sites by means VPNs enabled across an MPLS VPN network.
   Service Providers have been using constrained based routing using
   MPLS Traffic Engineering in their MPLS core between Provider Edge
   (PE) Label Switch Router (LSR) to carry the traffic between the PEs
   more optimaly and also to provide fast traffic restoration using a
   local protection technique such as Fast Reroute ([[RFC4090]]).

   In addition to IP connectivity services, Service Providers expressed
   the requirements to also be able to provide other services to VPN
   network based where Customer Edge (CE) routers could be
   interconnected via TE LSPs so as to offer CE-to-CE bandwidth
   guarantees, CE-to-CE protection (using a local protection recovery
   mechanism such as Fast Reroute [[RFC4090]]), and CE-to-CE path
   diversity.  It must be noted that CE-to-CE path diversity may be
   required in order to load balance the flows while avoiding to affect
   all the traffic between the CEs upon the occurence of a single
   failure or when a global protection mechanism is used, in which case
   the second TE LSP is used as a backup should the primary TE LSP be
   affected by a failure.

   The provisioning of a CE-to-CE TE LSP can be seen as a particular
   instanciation of inter-domain MPLS Traffic Engineering whereby a TE
   LSP is computed across multiple routing domains.  Thus, CE-to-CE TE
   LSP can be computed using either the per-domain path computation
   approach (described in [[I-D.ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-pd-path-comp]])
   or a PCE-based path computation technique such as
   [[I-D.vasseur-pce-brpc]].

   That said, the per-domain path computation technique may be
   suboptimal.  Consider the following network:

   CE1---PE1----P1----P2-----PE3----CE3
          |     |     |       |    /
         PE2----P3----P4-----PE4--/

   CE1, CE2 and CE3 belong to the same VPNx
   PE1, ..., PE4 are PEs routers
   P1, ..., P4 are P routers

   Objective is to compute a TE LSP T1 from CE1 to CE2

         Figure 1 - An example of CE to CE TE LSP

   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-pd-path-comp] specifies a path
   computation technique whereby each path segment is being computed (on
   a per domain basis) during TE LSP signaling.  In case of the example
   provided in figure 1, CE1 would compute the TE LSP up to PE1 (if PE1
   is chosen as its prefered next-hop), then PE1 would select its best
   next hop PE and would compute the path segment up to that node and
   finally that last egress PE would compute the last path segment up to
   the destination CE.  Altough such path computation allows for the
   computation of CE-to-CE TE LSP it cannot guarantee that the computed
   path is optimal (shortest constrained inter-domain TE LSP) and may
   lead to call admission failure due to the lack of TE information from
   the ingress to CE about the core network and from the ingress PE
   about the remote PE-CE link.

   Furthermore, the computation of a set of N diverse inter-domain paths
   is quite challenging.

   In contrast, PCE-based path computation techniques (see
   [[I-D.ietf-pce-architecture]]) have been defined that allows for the
   computation of shortest constrained inter-domain TE LSP, an
   particular instantiation of which is the CE-to-CE path computation.
   A Multi-PCE path computation technique has been described in
   [[I-D.vasseur-pce-brpc]] that can be used for the computation of such
   shortest constrained CE-to-CE TE LSP.  Applying the BRPC procedure, a
   CE acting as a PCC (Path Computation Client) sends a path computation
   request of one of its attached PE acting as a PCE (in the form of a
   PCEP [[I-D.ietf-pce-pcep]] PCReq message, which in turn relays the
   PCReq message to the egress PE (also acting as a PCE).  The shortest
   constrained CE-to-CE TE LSP would then be computed using the backward
   recursive scheme specifed in .  [I-D.vasseur-pce-brpc].  In the
   particular context of CE-to-CE TE LSP, the BRPC procedure can be
   optimized by extending the TED visibility to some PE-CE links.
   Indeed, the knowledge of TE PE-CE link characteristics would allow
   the ingress PE (e.g.  PE1) to compute in one pass the optimal
   (shortest) CE-to-CE TE LSP.

   MP-BGP protocol extensions are proposed in this document to extend
   the TED visibility to some PE-CE links.


3.  MP-BGP Protocol extensions

   A set of Traffic Engineering TLVs have been defined in [RFC3784] and
   [RFC3630] for ISIS and OSPF respectively.  Furthermore other TE link
   attributes may be advertised using the TLV specified in
   [[I-D.ietf-isis-link-attr]].  No new TE TLVs are specified in this
   document and the existing TE TLVs will be re-used for the PE-CE link
   without any change.

   This document introduces a new SAFI called TE-Link SAFI [to be
   defined in a further revision of this document].  The NLRI of this
   SAFI is of the form RD:IP-address, where the RD is the RD of the VRF
   as described in [RFC4364] and the IP-address is the address of the CE
   router.  The MP-BGP update for this SAFI will also be accompanied by
   extended community attribute carrying Export Route-targets as defined
   in [RFC4364].  This document also defines a new attribute called the
   TE attribute which carries the set of sub-TLVs defined in [RFC3784].
   The format of the BGP TE attribute will be defined in a further
   revision of this document.


4.  TED update

   The mode of operation described in this document requires to extend
   the TED so as to make it VPN-aware.  That said, this does not require
   any protocol extensions per-say and will not be discussed in this
   document.

   The receipt of an MP-BGP update comprising a new BGP TE attribute
   will simply trigger a TED update should a TE-related information for
   a PE-CE link be changed.  An implementation MAY use a threshold-based
   mechanisms to rate limit the frequency at which BGP updates will be
   sent (similarly to the IGP case).


5.  Example

   An example is provided in this section that shows how the MP-BGP
   extensions defined in this document optimizes the BRPC path
   computation in the context of CE-to-CE TE LSP.  Back to the exemplary
   network depicted in Figure 1.

   Step 1: The ingress CE (e.g.  CE1) selects a PCE (say PE1).

Internet-Draft       draft-vasseur-ccamp-ce-ce-te-02           June 2007


   Step 2: Upon receiving the PCReq message from CE1, PE1 (acting as a
   PCE) determines the set S of PEs with a PE-CE link to the destination
   CE (e.g.  CE2).  The following VSPT is then computed:

   VSPT computed by the ingress PE acting as a PCE

                 CE2
               /    \
              PE1  PE2

   Step 3: The shortest constrained path is then returned to CE1 in the
   form of a PCRep message (with loose hop).


6.  IANA Considerations

   The SAFI code for the TE SAFI will be assigned by IANA.

   The BGP TE attribute code will also be assigned by the IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues for BGP.
