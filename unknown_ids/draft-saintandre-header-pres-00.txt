Abstract

   This document defines a header field that enables the author of an
   email message to include a Presence URI in the message header block
   for the purpose of associating the author with an address that
   provides information about network availability, also known as
   "presence".

Internet-Draft                 Presence-ID                 November 2007


1.  Introduction

   Several technologies enable entities to share information about their
   network availability, also known as "presence" [IMP-REQS].  Such
   technologies include the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
   [XMPP-IM] and the Session Initiation Protocol [SIP-PRES].  To
   facilitate the exchange of presence information, a URI scheme for
   presence is defined in [CPP].

   Because almost all human users of presence systems are users of email
   systems, it can be helpful for such users to specify their presence
   URIs in the email messages they author.  The Presence-ID header field
   provides a standard location for such information.  This document
   documents the syntax and implementation of the Presence-ID header
   field, including the information necessary to register it in the
   Permanent Message Header Field Registry maintained by the IANA.


2.  Syntax

   The syntax of the Presence-ID header field is defined below using
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (as specified by [ABNF]), where the "PRES-
   URI" rule is defined in [CPP] and the remaining rules are defined in
   [MESSAGE]:

   "Presence-ID:" [FWS] PRES-URI *WSP CRLF


3.  Implementation

3.1.  Inclusion

   The Presence-ID header field is associated with the author of the
   message; see [MESSAGE].  If the "From:" header field contains more
   than one mailbox, the Presence-ID header field should not be added to
   the message.  There should be no more than one instance of the
   Presence-ID header field.

3.2.  Generation

   For a user whose presence URI is "juliet@example.com", the
   corresponding Presence-ID header field would be:

   Presence-ID: pres:juliet@example.com

3.3.  Processing

   Upon receiving an email message containing a Presence-ID header
   field, a mail user agent (MUA) that supports the field should process
   the field by resolving the presence URI in accordance with the
   procedures specified in [CPP].

3.4.  Disposition

   A mail user agent (MUA) that has processed a Presence-ID header field
   may provide appropriate interface elements if it has independent
   information linking the author of the email message with the
   specified presence URI (e.g., via a user-controlled address book or
   automated directory lookup).  If the user is subscribed to the
   presence of the author, such interface elements might include an
   indicator that the author is online and available for communication
   over a network.


4.  IANA Considerations

   In accordance with [REG], the IANA registers the "Presence-ID" header
   field in the Permanent Message Header Field Registry.  The
   registration template is as follows:

   Header field name:  Presence-ID
   Applicable protocol:  mail
   Status:  permanent
   Author/Change controller:  Peter Saint-Andre
      <mailto:stpeter@jabber.org>
   Specification document(s):  draft-saintandre-header-pres-00 [Note to
      IANA and RFC Editor: Replace I-D name with RFC XXXX, where "XXXX"
      is the number of the RFC that results from this specification, if
      any]
   Related information:  For detail information regarding presence URIs,
      refer to RFC 3859.


5.  Security Considerations

   Message headers are an existing standard and are designed to easily
   accommodate new types.  Although the Presence-ID header field may be
   forged, this problem is inherent in Internet email; however, because
   a forged Presence-ID header field may break automated processing,
   applications should not depend on the Presence-ID header field to
   indicate the authenticity of an email message or the identity of its
   author or sender.  Including the Presence-ID header field among the
   signer header fields in DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) can help to

   mitigate against forging of the header (see [DKIMSIG]).

   Advertising presence URIs in email headers may make it easier for
   malicious users to harvest such URIs addresses and therefore to send
   unsolicited bulk communications to the users or applications
   represented by those addresses.  Care should be taken in balancing
   the benefits of open information exchange against the potential costs
   of unwanted communication.  An email user agent that is capable of
   including the Presence-ID header field in outgoing email messages
   should provide an option for its user to disable inclusion of the
   Presence-ID header field generally, on a per-recipient basis, and on
   a per-message basis.

   The security considerations discussed in [URI] and [CPP] may also
   apply to the Presence-ID message header.
