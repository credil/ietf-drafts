Abstract 

   This document specifies a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload 
   format to be used for the low complexity subband codec (SBC), which 
   is the mandatory audio codec of the Advanced Audio Distribution 
   Profile (A2DP) Specification written by the Bluetooth(r) Special 
   Interest Group (SIG). The payload format is designed to be able to 
   interoperate with existing Bluetooth A2DP devices, to provide high 
   streaming audio quality, interactive audio transmission over the 
   internet, and ultra-low delay coding for jam sessions on the 
   internet. This document contains also a media type registration which 
   specifies the use of the RTP payload format.

1. Introduction 

   The Bluetooth(r) Special Interest Group (SIG) specifies in the 
   Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) [A2DPV10] a mono and 
   stereo high quality audio subband codec (SBC). This document 
   specifies the payload format for the encapsulation of SBC encoded 
   audio frames into the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). 

   SBC has a low computational complexity at modest compression rates. 
   Its bit rate can be controlled widely. Recommended operational modes 
   range from 127 to 345 kb/s, for mono and stereo audio signals. SBC's 
   algorithmic delay can be as low as 16 samples making it ideal for 
   ensembles playing music over the network requiring ultra low acoustic 
   delays.

3. Background 

   The A2DP specification is intended for streaming of music content to 
   headphones, headsets, or speakers over Bluetooth wireless channels. 
   A2DP supports multiple audio coding including MP3, AAC, ATRAC, which 
   are all non-mandatory. To ensure interoperability, the SBC codec has 
   been specified, which shall be included into all A2DP Bluetooth 
   devices.

   The SBC is a low complexity subband codec based on earlier work 
   presented in [Bon1995] and [Rault1989]. It has a moderate compression 
   ratio. The SBC encoder has filter banks splitting the audio signal 
   into 4 or 8 subbands. Then the codec decides with how many bits each 
   subband is encoded and finally quantizes the subband signals 
   blockwise. An SBC frame can have different block sizes. The size of a 
   block can be 4, 8, 12 or 16. Both decoder and encoder shall support 
   all four block sizes. 

   SBC can operate at four different sampling frequencies. The sampling 
   frequency can be selected from a set of 16, 32, 44.1, and 48 kHz. It 
   is mandatory that each SBC decoder can operate at the frequencies 
   44.1 and 48 kHz. Each SBC encoder shall work at least at a sampling 
   rate of 44.1 or 48 kHz.  

   Four channel modes are supported, which are mono, dual channel, 
   stereo, and joint-stereo. The decoder shall support all four of them; 
   the encoder shall support mono and at least one additional mode.  

   SBC can use four or eight subbands. The decoder shall support both; 
   the encoder shall support at least 8 subbands. 

   The bit allocation modes of SBC can be either based on signal to 
   noise ratio or on loudness. The decoder shall support both modes; the 
   encoder shall support at least the loudness mode. 

   The SBC encoder reduces one block to a given number of bits. The bit-
   pool variable defines how many bits are used per block. A2DP devices 
   define the range of valid bit-pool values by providing minimum and 
   maximum bit-pool values. The bit-pool values shall range from 2 to 
   250 but shall not be larger than number of subbands times 16 for the 
   mono and dual and times 32 for the stereo and joint-stereo channel 
   modes.  

   SBC encoders inside A2DP devices may be capable of changing the bit-
   pool parameter dynamically during the encoding process. For example, 
   algorithms were invented that change the number of bits depending on 
   the current acoustic content [Pilati2008].  

   The decoder shall support all possible bit-pool values that do not 
   result in excess of maximum bit rate, which is 320kb/s for mono and 
   512kb/s for two-channel modes. The encoder is required to support at 
   least one possible bit-pool value. The A2DP specification recommends 
   the encoding parameters given in Table 1.

   Table 1: Recommended sets of SBC parameters in the SRC device as 
   given in [A2DPV10] 

   The A2DP V1.0 specification describes a media payload format, which 
   we adopt in this document one-to-one without any change. 

4. Usage Scenarios 

   As compared to many other encoding schemes, the SBC is general enough 
   to support multiple, quite diverse usage scenarios. Thus, it might be 
   required to change the behavior of the encoding and transmission to 
   achieve a good performance for a given usage scenario. Thus, we 
   enlist three main scenarios and describe their quality requirements 
   and their impact on the encoding and transmission. 

4.1. Scenario 1: Interconnection of A2DP devices 

   In this scenario it is intended to interconnect Bluetooth A2DP 
   devices. RTP frames generated by an A2DP device can be transmitted 
   directly via this RTP profile. Vice versa, an A2DP device should be 
   able to receive the RTP profile by default. Thus, the payload format 
   describe in this RFC MUST be fully interoperable with any A2DP 
   device.

Internet-Draft  RTP Payload Format for Bluetooth's SBC    December 2009 
    

   The transmission between two A2DP devices has a constant frame rate 
   with a sender-controlled bit rate. It is not anticipated that the 
   transmission is adapted to congestion and bandwidth variation. 

4.2. Scenario 2: High quality interactive audio transmissions  

   In the second scenario we consider a telephone call having a very 
   good audio quality at modest acoustic one-way latencies ranging from 
   50 and 150 ms [ITUG107], so that music can be listened over the 
   telephone while two persons talk together interactively.  

   In addition, the reliability of the audio transmission should be 
   high, even in cases of low and varying bandwidth.  

   This second scenario assumes that the SBC transmission is used on top 
   of a transport protocol that implements a congestion control 
   algorithm. Using the SBC encoding, the sampling, bit, and frame rates 
   should be controlled to cope with congestion. For example, if the 
   available transmission bandwidth is too low to allow SBC to transmit 
   audio at a high quality, the application can lower the sampling, bit, 
   or frame rate of the stream at the cost of higher algorithmic delay 
   or a degraded audio quality. In this case, changing the sampling or 
   frame rate may cause a short acoustic artifact because SBC's internal 
   filters must be reset.  

   The A2DP media format does not allow a dynamic change of the encoding 
   parameters beside the bit-pool value. The encoding parameters can 
   only be altered with the "Change Parameters" procedure, which is 
   defined in [GAVDPV12].  Such a change will cause a hearable 
   interruption and thus shall be avoided.  

   If an application using RTP wants to switch between different sets of 
   encoding parameters, then these set of parameter CAN be either 
   negotiate beforehand (as described in Section 7.2.) or an 
   renegotiation similar to the "Change Parameters" procedure CAN take 
   place. An application MUST NOT change the sampling frequency, block 
   length, encoding mode or the number of subbands within one RTP 
   session having the same RTP payload identifier.  

4.3. Scenario 3: Ensembles performing over a network 

   In some usage scenarios, users want to act simultaneously and not 
   just interactively. For example, if persons sing in a chorus, if 
   musicians jam, or if e-sportsmen play computer games in a team 
   together, they need to acoustically communicate.  


 
 
Hoene et al.            Expires June 10, 2010                  [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft  RTP Payload Format for Bluetooth's SBC    December 2009 
    

   In these scenarios, the latency requirements are much harder than for 
   interactive usages. For example, if two musicians are placed more 
   than 10 meters apart, they can hardly keep synchronized. Empirical 
   studies [Gurevich2004] have shown that if ensembles playing over 
   networks, the optimal acoustic latency is around 11.5 ms with 
   targeted range from 10 to 25 ms.  

   To fulfill such requirements, it might be necessary to further reduce 
   the algorithmic coding delay by varying the block length parameter. 
   The default value of the block length parameter is chosen such that 
   the coding efficiency is maximized. For example, at 44.1 kHz and 
   using 8 subbands and a block length of 16, the algorithmic delay is 
   4.72 ms (208 samples). The value of the block length parameter can be 
   decreased, at the expense of a higher bit rate or lower quality, to 
   lower the latency to fulfill the very stringent latency requirements 
   of this scenario. 

   Still, given the speed of light as the fundamental limit of speed of 
   information exchange, distributed ensembles can perform only 
   regionally if latency budget of 25 ms must keep. Typically, an 
   optical fiber has a refractive index of 1.46 and thus in an optical 
   fiber bits travel about 5136 km one-way in 25 ms. 

5. Header Usage 

   The format of the RTP header is specified in [RFC3550]. The payload 
   format defined in this document uses the fields of the header in a 
   manner fully consistent with that specification. 

   marker (M): In accordance with [A2DPV10] the marker bit MUST be set 
             to zero. 

   payload type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this 
             packet format is outside the scope of the document, and 
             will not be specified here. It is expected that the RTP 
             profile under which this payload format is being used will 
             assign a payload type for this codec or specify that the 
             payload type is to be bound dynamically (see Section 6.2).

Internet-Draft  RTP Payload Format for Bluetooth's SBC    December 2009 
    

   timestamp (TS): The RTP timestamp clock frequency MUST be the same as 
             the ampling frequency, which has been negotiated for the 
             current RTP session (see Section 6.2). If a media payload 
             consists of multiple SBC frames, the TS of the media packet 
             header represents the TS of the first SBC frame. The TS of 
             the following SBC frames MUST be calculated using the 
             sampling rate and the number of samples per frame per 
             channel. A change in sampling frequency MUST NOT occur 
             within one media packet. 
             A SBC frame may be fragmented into multiple media packets 
             to reduce the packetisation delay. Then, all packets that 
             make up a fragmented SBC frame MUST use the same TS. 

6. Payload Format 

   The format of the payload MUST follow exactly the description given 
   in the appendix of [A2DPV10]. In the following, for the sake of 
   clarity, we repeat the payload format definition. 

   The payload MUST consist of one media payload format header described 
   in Section 5.2 and SBC frames described in Section 5.3. Either an 
   integral number of SBC frames or one fragment of an SBC frame can be 
   transmitted: 

    (a) When the payload contains an integral number of SBC frames 
   +--------+-----------+-----------   -+ 
   | Header | SBC frame | SBC frame ... | 
   +--------+-----------+-----------   -+ 

   (b) When the SBC frame is fragmented 
   +--------+---------------------------------------+ 
   | Header | First fragment of SBC frame           |  
   +--------+---------------------------------------+ 
    
   +--------+---------------------------------------+ 
   | Header | Subsequent fragments of the SBC frame |  
   +--------+---------------------------------------+ 

   A media payload always starts with an 8-bit header, which is placed 
   before the SBC data. 

   The SBC frame can be fragmented across several media payloads. All 
   fragmented packets, except the last one, MUST have the same total 
   data packet size.  

   This payload fragmentation CAN be preferred against the fragmentation 
   mechanisms of lower layers (e.g., IP) because the packetisation delay 
 
 
Hoene et al.            Expires June 10, 2010                  [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft  RTP Payload Format for Bluetooth's SBC    December 2009 
    

   and thus the acoustic latency are reduced and the error robustness is 
   increased because parts of the SBC frame can be considered for 
   decoding. 

6.1. Media payload format header 

   The following figure shows the format of media payload header, which 
   consists of one byte. 

   0 1 2 3   4 5 6 7  
   +-+-+-+---+-+-+-+-+ 
   |F|S|L|RFA|#frames|  
   +-+-+-+---+-+-+-+-+ 

   F bit - Set to 1 if the SBC frame is fragmented, otherwise set to 0. 

   S bit - Set to 1 for the starting packet of a fragmented SBC frame, 
             otherwise set to 0. 

   L bit - Set to 1 for the last packet of a fragmented SBC frame, 
             otherwise set to 0. 

   RFA - SHOULD be zero, reserved for future addition. 

   #frames (4 bits) - If the F bit is set to 0, this field indicates the 
             number of frames contained in this packet. If the F bit is 
             set to 1, this field indicates the number of remaining 
             fragments, including the current fragment. Thus the last 
             counter value MUST be one. For example, if there are three 
             fragments then the counter has value 3, 2 and 1 for 
             subsequent fragments.  

6.2. SBC Frame Structure 

   The complete SBC frame consists of a frame header, scale factors, 
   audio samplings, and padding bits. The following diagram shows the 
   general SBC frame format layout: 

   +--------------+---------------+---------------+---------+ 
   | frame_header | scale_factors | audio_samples | padding | 
   +--------------+---------------+---------------+---------+ 

   The following sections describe the audio format, which consists of 
   bits stored in a bandwidth-efficient, compact mode.

6.3. Frame header 

   The frame header consists of fields defined in [A2DPV10], which are 
   SYNCWORD, SAMPLING_FREQUENCY, BLOCKS, CHANNEL_MODE, 
   ALLOCATION_METHOD, SUBBANDS, BITPOOL, CRC_CHECK, optionally JOIN bit 
   fields and a RFA. The layout of the first four bytes of the frame 
   header is given in the following table. 

   0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   | SYNCWORD      |SF.|BL.|CM.|A|S|BITPOOL        |CRC_CHECK      | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   Legend: SF.=SAMPLING FREQUENCY, BL.=BLOCKS, CM.=CHANNEL_MODE, 
   A.=ALLOCATION_METHOD, S.=SUBBANDS 

   SYNCWORD (8 bits): The first field is the 8 bit synchronization word, 
             which is always set to 156. 

   SAMPLING_FREQUENCY (2 bits): The sampling frequency field indicates 
             with which sampling frequency the SBC frame has been 
             encoded. The table below specifies the corresponding 
             sampling frequencies for the bit patterns. The sampling 
             frequency MUST NOT be changed without changing the payload 
             type, too. 

   +--------------------+----------------+     
   | SAMPLING_FREQUENCY | sampling       | 
   |    bit 0 1         | frequency (Hz) | 
   +--------------------+----------------+     
   |        0 0         |      16000     | 
   |        0 1         |      32000     | 
   |        1 0         |      44100     | 
   |        1 1         |      48000     | 
   +--------------------+----------------+     

   BLOCKS (2 bits): It indicates the block size with which the stream 
             has been encoded. The block size is selected conforming to

   CHANNEL_MODE (2 bits): These two bits indicate with which channel 
             mode the frame has been encoded. The number of channels 
             depends on this information. The channel mode MUST NOT be 
             changed without changing the payload type, too.

   ALLOCATION_METHOD (1 bit): This bit indicates how the bit pool is 
             allocated to different subbands. Either it is based on the 
             loudness of the sub band signal or on the signal to noise 
             ratio. The allocation method MUST NOT be changed without 
             changing the payload type, too.

   BITPOOL (8 bits): This unsigned integer indicates the size of the bit 
             allocation pool that has been used for encoding the current 
             block. The value of the bit-pool field MUST NOT exceed 16 
             times the number of subbands for the MONO and DUAL_CHANNEL 
             channel modes and 32 times the number of subbands for the 
             STEREO and JOINT_STEREO channel modes. The bitpool value 
             MAY change from SBC frame to the next. In addition, the 
             bitpool value MUST be restricted such that it does not 
             result in excess of maximum bit rate, which is 320kb/s for 
             mono and 512kb/s for two-channel modes. 

  The remaining part of the header consists of CRC_CHECK, optionally 
  JOIN bit fields and a RFA. 

6.4. Remaining frame 

   The remaining part of the frame includes scale factors and audio 
   sample data, which are processed by the codec as described in 
   [A2DPV10]. 

7. Payload Format Parameters 

   This section defines the parameters that MAY be used to configure 
   optional features in the SBC payload format over RTP transmission. 

   The parameters are defined here as part of the media subtype 
   registrations for the SBC. A mapping of the parameters into the 
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] is also provided for 
   those applications that use SDP. In control protocols that do not use 
   MIME or SDP, the media type parameters must be mapped to the 
   appropriate format used with that control protocol.

7.1.1. Capabilities: A2DP modes 

   The capabilities of the encoder and decoder MUST start with the 
   hexadecimal value of 9C, followed by a comma and four comma-separated 
   hexadecimal octets. These four octets called Octet 1, 2, 3, and 4 
   share a similar meaning as those defined in Section 4.3.2 of 
   [A2DPV10]. However, because sampling frequency and number of channels 
   are already given in the SDP parameter "a=rtpmap", bit 0 up to and 
   including bit 3 of Octet 1 MUST BE ignored if received. The meaning 
   of the bits and the octets are described in the following 
   enumeration. The bit numbering follows the network bit order having 
   the highest bit first. 

   o  Octet 1: Bit 0 (aka 2^7): If one, then the sampling frequency 
      16000 Hz is supported (ignored during SDP negotiations but SHOULD 
      be set if the clock rate is 16000 and CAN be cleared otherwise). 

   o  Octet 1: Bit 1: If one, then the sampling frequency 32000 Hz is 
      supported (ignored during SDP negotiations but SHOULD be set if 
      the clock rate is 32000 and CAN be cleared otherwise). 

   o  Octet 1: Bit 2: If one, then the sampling frequency 44100 Hz is 
      supported (ignored during SDP negotiations but SHOULD be set if 
      the clock rate is 44100 and CAN be cleared otherwise). 

   o  Octet 1: Bit 3: If one, then the sampling frequency 48000 Hz is 
      supported (ignored during SDP negotiations but SHOULD be set if 
      the clock rate is 48000 and CAN be cleared otherwise). 

   o  Octet 1: Bit 4: If one, then the channel mode MONO is supported 
      (ignored during SDP negotiations but SHOULD be set if the number 
      of channels is one and CAN be cleared otherwise). 

   o  Octet 1: Bit 5: If one, then the channel mode DUAL_CHANNEL is 
      supported (*). 

   o  Octet 1: Bit 6: If one, then the channel mode STEREO is supported 
      (*). 

   o  Octet 1: Bit 7 (aka 2^0): If one, then the channel mode 
      JOINT_STEREO is supported (*). 

   o  Octet 2: Bit 0: If one, the block length can be 4. 

   o  Octet 2: Bit 1: If one, the block length can be 8. 

   o  Octet 2: Bit 2: If one, the block length can be 12.

   o  Octet 2: Bit 3: If one, the block length can be 16. 

   o  Octet 2: Bit 4: If one, the number of subband can be 4. 

   o  Octet 2: Bit 5: If one, the number of subband can be 8. 

   o  Octet 2: Bit 6: If one, the allocation mode based on signal to 
      noise ratio is supported.  

   o  Octet 2: Bit 7: If one, the allocation mode based on loudness is 
      supported.  

   o  Octet 3: Unsigned integer: The minimal bit-pool value that the 
      device supports. MUST be larger or equal than 2 and less or equal 
      than the maximal bit-pool value. 

   o  Octet 4: Unsigned integer: The maximal bit-pool value that the 
      device supports MUST be equal or lower than 250. 

   (*) At least one of the bits 5, 6 or 7 of Octet 1 MUST be set if the 
      number of channels is set to two in the SDP parameter "a=rtpmap". 

7.1.2. Capabilities: other modes 

   If the value of the VERSION octet is not equal to a known SYNCWORD 
   value, then the capabilities MUST be ignored.  

7.2. Mapping to SDP Parameters 

   The information carried in the media type specification has a 
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) 
   [RFC4566], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions. When SDP 
   is used to specify sessions employing the SBC codec, the mapping is 
   as follows: 

   o  The media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name. 

   o  The media subtype ("SBC") goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the encoding 
      name.  

   o  The RTP <clock rate> in "a=rtpmap" MUST be set to the selected 
      sampling frequency.   

   o  The RTP <encoding parameters> in "a=rtpmap" specifies the number 
      of audio channels: 2 for stereo material (refer to RFC 4566 
      [RFC4566]) and 1 for mono. If one channel is used, the encoding 
      parameter can be omitted.

Internet-Draft  RTP Payload Format for Bluetooth's SBC    December 2009 
    

   o  The parameter "capabilities" goes in the SDP "a=fmtp" by the 
      capabilities description as described in Section 7.1.  

   o  Offer-Answer Model Considerations 

   The Bluetooth standard document [AVDTPV12] describes how an A2DP 
   source and an A2DP sink negotiate their capabilities. Prior to the 
   establishment of the audio stream, one A2DP device can query the 
   service capabilities of the other device using the "Get Capabilities 
   Procedure". In any case, the coding mode is set using the "Set 
   Configuration" procedure. Only after a successful configuration, the 
   stream connection can be established. 

   In addition to the Bluetooth negotiation procedure, the SDP 
   negotiation MUST NOT agree on one single configuration but CAN agree 
   that multiple configuration modes, which are identified by different 
   payload type values, are supported. 

   The following considerations apply when using SDP offer-answer 
   procedures [RFC3264] to negotiate the use of SBC payload in RTP: 

   o  The "capabilities" parameter is bi-directional, i.e., the 
      restricted mode set applies to media both to be received and sent 
      by the declaring entity. If the capabilities were supplied in the 
      offer, the answerer MUST return either the same mode-set or a 
      subset of this mode-set. If no capabilities were supplied in the 
      offer, the answerer MAY return capabilities to restrict the 
      possible modes. In any case, the capabilities in the answer then 
      apply for both offerer and answerer. The offerer MUST NOT send 
      frames of a mode that has been removed by the answerer. The 
      negotiation is finished if the offerer and the answerer have 
      agreed upon explicit capabilities for each payload type number. 
      The number of blocks and subbands and the kind of allocation 
      method and channel mode MUST haven been negotiated unambiguously. 

   o  Any unknown parameter in an offer MUST be ignored by the receiver 
      and MUST NOT be included in the answer. 

   Below are some example parts of SDP offer-answer exchanges.

7.2.1. Declarative SDP Considerations 

   For declarative use of SDP nothing specific is defined for this 
   payload format. The configuration given by the SDP MUST be used when 
   sending and/or receiving media in the session. 

8. Congestion Control 

   One Bluetooth links, bandwidth can be reserved and thus the A2DP 
   specification does not consider any kind of congestion control. 
   However, congestion control is an important issue for any usage in 
   non-dedicated networks such as the Internet. Thus, congestion control 
   for RTP MUST be used in accordance with [RFC3550] and any appropriate 
   profile (for example, [RFC3551]). An additional requirement if best-
   effort service is being used is: users of this payload format MUST 
   monitor packet loss to ensure that the packet loss rate is within 
   acceptable parameters. 

   Reducing the session bandwidth is possible by one or more of the 
   following means, which all will have negative impact to the users' 
   experience as he can notice a higher latency or a degraded audio 
   quality. The selection of the following means depends on current 
   usage scenario, the congestion control protocol, and the perceptual

   assessment of the audio transmission and is not subject of this 
   specification. 

   1. If the bandwidth and frame rate shall be reduced, the sampling 
      rate can be lowered [Boutremans2004,Hoene2005]. 

   2. If the gross bandwidth and the frame rate shall be reduced, more 
      blocks can be put into one SBC frame and more SBC frames can be 
      placed in one RTP payload. 

   3. If the bandwidth shall be reduced, then the bit-pool value can be 
      reduced, so that the frames get smaller or the mono mode can be 
      selected. 

   4. If the bandwidth is very low, instead of an ongoing transmission, 
      a push-to-talk like service with temporary transmission 
      interruptions and a high delay can be applied.  

   5. If the packet loss rate is very high, the session shall be 
      terminated because the quality of the audio transmission is too 
      bad to be useful [Widmer2002]. 

   Because the SBC encoding can be tuned with many parameters, it is 
   especially useful for rate adaptive transport protocols such as DCCP 
   [RFC4340] or TCP [RFC4571]. The report [Hoene2009] describes, which 
   SBC coding mode gives the best speech and audio quality under known 
   bandwidth and time constrains.  

9. Packet loss concealment 

   In order to cope with packet losses, the SBC decoder SHOULD be 
   extended by a packet loss concealment algorithm. The packet loss 
   concealment algorithm SHOULD provide a good audio quality in case of 
   losses. Otherwise, the congestion control algorithm can not trade off 
   well the quality impairment due to packet losses versus the quality 
   impairment caused by different encoding modes. It is RECOMMENDED that 
   at a least the reserve order replicated pitch periods (RORPP) 
   algorithm as defined in [Hoene2009] or any better is used.  

   If this requirement is not meet, then the congestion control cannot 
   predict the impact of packet loss on the audio quality and thus will 
   not be able to control the encoding parameters optimally. 

10. Security Considerations 

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification 
   are subject to the general security considerations discussed in the 
 
 
Hoene et al.            Expires June 10, 2010                 [Page 19] 

Internet-Draft  RTP Payload Format for Bluetooth's SBC    December 2009 
    

   RTP specification [RFC3550] and any appropriate profile (for example, 
   [RFC3551]).  

   As this format transports encoded speech/audio, the main security 
   issues include confidentiality, integrity protection, and 
   authentication of the speech/audio itself.  The payload format itself 
   does not have any built-in security mechanisms.  Any suitable 
   external mechanisms, such as SRTP [RFC3711], MAY be used. 

   This payload format and the SBC encoding do not exhibit any large 
   non-uniformity in the receiver-end computational load and thus are 
   unlikely to pose a denial-of-service threat due to the receipt of 
   pathological datagrams. 

11. IANA Considerations 

   It is requested that one new media subtype (audio/SBC) and one 
   optional parameter for this media subtype ("capabilities") are 
   registered by IANA, see Section 5.1 and Section 5.2.
