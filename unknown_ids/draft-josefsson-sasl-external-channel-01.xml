  <t>This document describes a way to perform end-user authentication
    in the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework
    by re-using an external security layer (such as the Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) protocol) that may have already completed
    end-user authentication.  In comparison with the existing EXTERNAL
    mechanism, this mechanism alleviates the a priori assumptions made
    by the design of the EXTERNAL mechanism.  This mechanism transfers
    an identifier of the external channel to be used explicitly.</t>

<section title="Introduction">

  <t>The EXTERNAL mechanism, described in Appendix A of
    <xref target="RFC4422" /> allows a client to request the server to
    use credentials established by means external to the mechanism to
    authenticate the client.  The external means may be, for instance,
    <xref target="RFC5246">TLS</xref> or <xref target="RFC4301">IP
      Security</xref> services.</t>

  <t>The EXTERNAL mechanism requires some a prior agreement between
    the client and the server regarding which external channel, and
    consequently which external credentials, should be used for
    authentication.  In practice this has often meant that the
    EXTERNAL mechanism is only used when there is tight out of band
    interaction between the server administration and client user.
    This has impacted the interoperability of the EXTERNAL
    mechanism.</t>

  <t>The EXTERNAL-CHANNEL mechanism, specified in this document, is
    similar to the EXTERNAL mechanism in that it relies on an external
    channel to perform the user authentication.  However,
    EXTERNAL-CHANNEL provides a way for the client to provide an
    identifier of the external channel that provides the user
    credentials.  The intention is that the server need not rely on a
    priori arrangement to identify the secure channel that was used,
    but can automatically find the intended channel and re-use its
    credentials for the SASL authentication.</t>

  <t>In the EXTERNAL-CHANNEL mechanism, the external channel is
    identified using the "Channel binding unique prefix" string as
    defined in <xref target="RFC5056" />.</t>

</section>

<section title="Technical Specification">

  <t>The name of this mechanism is "EXTERNAL-CHANNEL".</t>

  <t>The mechanism does not provide a security layer.  It provides
    similar functionality by relying on an external channel.</t>

  <t>The mechanism is capable of transferring a channel name and an
    authorization identity string.  If the authorization identity
    string is empty, the client is requesting to act as the identity
    the server has associated with the client's credentials.  If the
    authorization identity string is non-empty, the client is
    requesting to act as the identity represented by the string.  The
    channel name cannot be empty.</t>

  <t>The client is expected to send data first in the authentication
    exchange.  Where the client does not provide an initial response
    data in its request to initiate the authentication exchange, the
    server is to respond to the request with an empty initial
    challenge and then the client is to provide its initial
    response.</t>

  <t>The client sends the initial response containing the channel
    name, and a <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref> encoding of the
    requested authorization identity string.</t>

  <t>The authorization identity is non-empty when the client is
    requesting to act as the identity represented by the (non-empty)
    string.  The authorization identity is empty when the client is
    requesting to act as the identity the server associates with the
    external authentication credentials.</t>

  <t>The syntax of the initial response is specified as a value of the
    &lt;extern-initial-resp&gt; production detailed below using the
    <xref target="RFC5234">Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)</xref>
    notation.</t>

  <figure>
    <artwork type="abnf">
   external-initial-resp = cb-name " " authz-id-string

   cb-name               = 1*( US-ASCII / "." / "-")
        ;; Based on RFC 5056: "There is no naming convention for channel
        ;; bindings: any string composed of US-ASCII alphanumeric
        ;; characters, period ('.'), and dash ('-') will suffice."

   authz-id-string       = *( UTF8-char-no-nul )
   UTF8-char-no-nul      = UTF8-1-no-nul / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4
        ;; where the UTF8-2, UTF8-3, and UTF8-4 productions are
        ;; as defined in RFC 3629.

   UTF8-1-no-nul         = %x01-7F
    </artwork>
  </figure>

  <t>There are no additional challenges and responses.</t>

  <t>Hence, the server is to return the outcome of the authentication
    exchange.</t>

  <t>The exchange fails if</t>

  <t>- the cb-name denote an (to the server implementation) unknown or
    end-point channel binding type,</t>

  <t>- the client has not established its credentials via the
    indicated external channel,</t>

  <t>- the client's credentials are inadequate,</t>

  <t>- the client provided an empty authorization identity string and
    the server is unwilling or unable to associate an authorization
    identity with the client's credentials,</t>

  <t>- the client provided a non-empty authorization identity string
    that is invalid per the syntax requirements of the applicable
    application protocol specification,</t>

  <t>- the client provided a non-empty authorization identity string
    representing an identity that the client is not allowed to act as,
    or</t>

  <t>- the server is unwilling or unable to provide service to the
    client for any other reason.</t>

  <t>Otherwise the exchange is successful.  When indicating a
    successful outcome, additional data is not provided.</t>

<section title="Examples">

  <t>This section provides examples of EXTERNAL-CHANNEL authentication
    exchanges.  The examples are intended to help the readers
    understand the above text.  The examples are not definitive.  The
    <xref target="RFC2244">Application Configuration Access Protocol
    (ACAP)</xref> is used in the examples because ACAP sends the SASL
    tokens without additional encoding.</t>

  <t>The first example shows use of EXTERNAL-CHANNEL with an empty
    authorization identity and an external "tls-unique" channel.  In
    this example, the initial response is not sent in the client's
    request to initiate the authentication exchange.</t>

  <figure>
    <artwork>
      S: * ACAP (SASL "DIGEST-MD5")
      C: a001 STARTTLS
      S: a001 OK "Begin TLS negotiation now"
      &lt;TLS negotiation, further commands are under TLS layer&gt;
      S: * ACAP (SASL "DIGEST-MD5" "EXTERNAL-CHANNEL")
      C: a002 AUTHENTICATE "EXTERNAL-CHANNEL"
      S: + "tls-unique "
      C: + ""
      S: a002 OK "Authenticated"
      </artwork>
    </figure>

  <t>Note how the string ends with a " ", it needs to be present even
    if the authorization identity is empty.</t>

  <t>The second example shows use of EXTERNAL-CHANNEL with an
    authorization identity of "simon" bound to an external
    "tls-unique" channel.  In this example, the initial response is
    sent with the client's request to initiate the authentication
    exchange.  This saves a round-trip.</t>

  <figure>
    <artwork>
      S: * ACAP (SASL "DIGEST-MD5")
      C: a001 STARTTLS
      S: a001 OK "Begin TLS negotiation now"
      &lt;TLS negotiation, further commands are under TLS layer&gt;
      S: * ACAP (SASL "DIGEST-MD5" "EXTERNAL-CHANNEL")
      C: a002 AUTHENTICATE "EXTERNAL-CHANNEL" {16+}
      C: tls-unique simon
      S: a002 NO "Cannot assume requested authorization identity"
    </artwork>
  </figure>

  <t>Note how the server rejects the authentication attempt with an
    authorization-related error message.  Presumably the client
    credentials presented in the TLS session does not give the client
    authority to assume the identity of "simon".</t>

</section>

<section title="Making Authorization Decisions">

  <t>The server may use any mechanism to make authorization decisions.
    For illustration, we want to give some ideas on how this may work
    in practice.  This section is not normative.</t>

  <t>Typically the external channel will not use authentication
    identities that can be used by the application protocol that uses
    the SASL EXTERNAL-CHANNEL mechanism.  Thus, a mapping is normally
    required.  There may be mappings from the external credential to a
    set of permitted identifiers, and a "default" identifier can be
    provided in the mapping table if the client do not specify a
    particular authorization identity.</t>

  <t>For example, when mapping from X.509 credentials used in TLS
    connections to simple usernames, a table stored on the server can
    contain hex-encoded hashes of client X.509 certificates and a set
    of usernames.</t>

  <figure>

    </artwork>
  </figure>

  <t>The server could extract a successfully authenticated X.509
    client certificate from the TLS stack, hash it and look it up in
    the mapping table.  Each of the usernames given would be permitted
    authorization identities.  The first username given may be the
    default username if the client does not provide an authorization
    identity.</t>

  <t>When mapping from <xref target="RFC5081">OpenPGP credentials used
    in TLS</xref>, the mapping table could consist of verified OpenPGP
    fingerprints and a set of permitted usernames, such as the
    following table.</t>

    </artwork>
  </figure>

  <t>When <xref target="RFC5054">SRP authentication with TLS</xref> is
    used, the username provided may be the same as the application
    username, and no mapping would be necessary.</t>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

  <t>The IANA is request to add to the SASL mechanisms registry the
    following entry.</t>

<section title="Security Considerations">

  <t>The EXTERNAL-CHANNEL mechanism does not authenticate users
    itself, it relies on implementation to perform the authentication
    as part of the external channel.  Care must be taken to ensure
    that the client credential has been authenticated, rather than
    just blindly accepted as part of a leap-of-faith setup.</t>

  <t>The security of external channel is critical to the security of
    this mechanism.  The connection between the authentication and the
    external channel is made by sending the name of the channel, so
    the security considerations related to channel bindings are also
    relevant, see <xref target="RFC5056"/>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Acknowledgements">

  <t>The EXTERNAL-CHANNEL mechanism, and significant amount of text in
    this document, is based on the EXTERNAL mechanism in Appendix A
    of <xref target="RFC4422">SASL</xref>.</t>
