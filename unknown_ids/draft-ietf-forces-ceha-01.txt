                       Figure 1: ForCES Architecture

   The ForCES architecture allows FEs to be aware of multiple CEs but
   enforces that only one CE be the master controller.  This is known in
   the industry as 1+N redundancy [refxxxx].  The master CE controls the
   FEs via the ForCES protocol operating in the Fp interface.  If the
   master CE becomes faulty, a backup CE takes over and NE operation
   continues.  By definition, the current documented setup is known as
   cold-standby [refxxxx].  The CE set is static and is passed to the FE

   by the FE Manager (FEM) via the Ff interface and to each CE by the CE
   Manager (CEM) in the Fc interface during the pre-association phase.

   From an FE perspective, the knobs of control for a CE set are defined
   by the FEPO LFB in [RFC5810], Appendix B.  Section 3.1 of this
   document details these knobs further.

2.1.  Document Scope

   By current definition, the Fr interface is out of scope for the
   ForCES architecture.  However, it is expected that organizations
   implementing a set of CEs will need to have the CEs communicate to
   each other via the Fr interface in order to achieve the
   synchronization necessary for controlling the FEs.

   The problem scope addressed by this document falls into 2 areas:

   1.  To describe with more clarity (than [RFC5810]) how current cold-
       standby approach operates within the NE cluster.

   2.  To describe how to evolve the cold-standby setup to a hot-standby
       redundancy setup so as to improve the failover time and NE
       availability.

2.2.  Quantifying Problem Scope

   The NE recovery and availability is dependent on several time-
   sensitive metrics:

   1.  How fast the CE plane failure is detected the FE.

   2.  How fast a backup CE becomes operational.

   3.  How fast the FEs associate with the new master CE.

   4.  How fast the FEs recover their state and become operational.

   The design goals of the current [RFC5810] choices to meet the above
   goals are driven by desire for simplicity.

   To quantify the above criteria with the current prescribed ForCES CE
   setup in [RFC5810]:

   1.  How fast the CE side detects a CE failure is left undefined.  To
       illustrate an extreme scenario, we could have a human operator
       acting as the monitoring entity to detect faulty CEs.  How fast
       such detection happens could be in the range of seconds to days.
       A more active monitor on the Fr interface could improve this

Internet-Draft      ForCES Intra-NE High Availability      February 2011


       detection.

   2.  How fast the backup CE becomes operational is also currently out
       of scope.  In the current setup, a backup CE need not be
       operational at all (for example, to save power) and therefore it
       is feasible for a monitoring entity to boot up a backup CE after
       it detects the failure of the master CE.  In this document
       Section 4 we suggest that at least one backup CE be online so as
       to improve this metric.

   3.  How fast an FE associates with new master CE is also currently
       undefined.  The cost of an FE connecting and associating adds to
       the recovery overhead.  As mentioned above we suggest having at
       least one backup CE online.  In Section 4 we propose to zero out
       the connection and association cost on failover by having each FE
       associate with all online backup CEs after associating to the
       active CE.  Note that if an FE pre-associates with backup CEs,
       then the system will be technically operating in hot-standby
       mode.

   4.  And last: How fast an FE recovers its state depends on how much
       NE state exists.  By ForCES current definition, the new master CE
       assumes zero state on the FE and starts from scratch to update
       the FE.  So the larger the state, the longer the recovery.


3.  RFC5810 CE HA Framework

   To achieve CE High Availabilty, FEs and CEs MUST inter-operate per
   [RFC5810] definition which is repeated for contextual reasons in
   Section 3.1.  It should be noted that in this default setup, which
   MUST be implemented by CEs and FEs needing HA, the Fr plane is out of
   scope (and if available is proprietary to an implementation).

3.1.  Current CE High Availability Support

   As mentioned earlier, although there can be multiple redundant CEs,
   only one CE actively controls FEs in a ForCES NE.  In practice there
   may be only one backup CE.  At any moment in time only one master CE
   can control the FEs.  In addition, the FE connects and associates to
   only the master CE.  The FE and the CE PL are aware of the primary
   and one or more secondary CEs.  This information (primary, secondary
   CEs) is configured on the FE and the CE PLs during pre-association by
   the FEM and the CEM respectively.

   Figure 2 below illustrates the Forces message sequences that the FE
   uses to recover the connection in current defined cold-standby
   scheme.

                  Figure 2: CE Failover for Cold Standby

3.1.1.  Cold Standby Interaction with ForCES Protocol

   High Availability parameterization in an FE is driven by configuring
   the FE Protocol Object (FEPO) LFB.

   The FEPO CEID component identifies the current master CE and the
   component table BackupCEs identifies the backup CEs.  The FEPO FE
   Heartbeat Interval, CE Heartbeat Dead Interval, and CE Heartbeat
   policy help in detecting connectivity problems between an FE and CE.
   The CE Failover policy defines how the FE should react on a detected
   failure.

   Figure 3 illustrates the defined state machine that facilitates
   connection recovery.

   The FE connects to the CE specified on FEPO CEID component.  If it
   fails to connect to the defined CE, it moves it to the bottom of
   table BackupCEs and sets its CEID component to be the first CE
   retrieved from table BackupCEs.  The FE then attempts to associate
   with the CE designated as the new primary CE.  The FE continues
   through this procedure until it successfully connects to one of the
   CEs.

                 Figure 3: FE State Machine considering HA

   When communication fails between the FE and CE (which can be caused
   by either the CE or link failure but not FE related), either the TML
   on the FE will trigger the FE PL regarding this failure or it will be
   detected using the HB messages between FEs and CEs.  The
   communication failure, regardless of how it is detected, MUST be
   considered as a loss of association between the CE and corresponding
   FE.

   If the FE's FEPO CE Failover Policy is configured to mode 0 (the
   default), it will immediately transition to the pre-association
   phase.  This means that if association is again established, all FE
   state will need to be re-established.

   If the FE's FEPO CE Failover Policy is configured to mode 1, it
   indicates that the FE is capable of HA restart recovery.  In such a
   case, the FE transitions to the not associated state and the CEFTI
   timer[RFC 5810] is started.  The FE MAY continue to forward packets
   during this state.  It MAY also recycle through any configured backup

   CEs in a round-robin fashion.  It first adds its primary CE to the
   bottom of table BackupCEs and sets its CEID component to be the first
   secondary retrieved from table BackupCEs.  The FE then attempts to
   associate with the CE designated as the new primary CE.  If it fails
   to re-associate with any CE and the CEFTI expires, the FE then
   transitions to the pre-association state.

   If the FE, while in the not associated state, manages to reconnect to
   a new primary CE before CEFTI expires it transitions to the
   Associated state.  Once re-associated, the FE tries to recover any
   state that may have been lost during the not associated state.  How
   the FE achieves to re-synchronize its state is out of scope for the
   current ForCES architecture.

   An explicit message (a Config message setting Primary CE component in
   ForCES Protocol object) from the primary CE, can also be used to
   change the Primary CE for an FE during normal protocol operation.  In
   this case, the FE transitions to the Not Associated State and
   attempts to Associate with the new CE.

3.1.2.  Responsibilities for HA

   XXX: we may remove this section (not much value to overall
   discussion)

   TML Level:

   1.  The TML controls logical connection availability and failover.

   2.  The TML also controls peer HA management.

   At this level, control of all lower layers, for example transport
   level (such as IP addresses, MAC addresses etc) and associated links
   going down are the role of the TML.

   PL Level:
   All other functionality, including configuring the HA behavior during
   setup, the CE IDs used to identify primary and secondary CEs,
   protocol messages used to report CE failure (Event Report), Heartbeat
   messages used to detect association failure, messages to change the
   primary CE (Config), and other HA related operations described
   before, are the PL responsibility.

   To put the two together, if a path to a primary CE is down, the TML
   would take care of failing over to a backup path, if one is
   available.  If the CE is totally unreachable then the PL would be
   informed and it would take the appropriate actions described before.

4.  CE HA Hot Standby

   In this section we make some small extensions to the existing scheme
   to enable it to achieve hot standby HA.  With these suggested changes
   we achieve some of the goals defined in Section 2.2, namely:

   o  How fast a backup CE becomes operational.

   o  How fast the FEs associate with the new master CE.

   As described in Section 3.1, in the pre-association phase the FEM
   configures the FE to make it aware of all the CEs in the NE.  The FEM
   MUST configure the FE to make it aware of which CE is the master and
   MAY specify any backup CE(s).

   The FE's FEPO LFB version 2 AllCEs table (previously BackupCEs)
   contains all the CEIDs that the FE may connect and associate with.
   The sequence of the CE IDs is also the conncetion priority for the
   FE.  In the pre-association phase, the first CE ID in the AllCEs
   table MUST be the first CE ID that the FE will attempt to connect and
   associate with.  If the FE fails to connect and associate with the
   first CE ID it will attempt to connect to the second CE ID and so
   forth, until there is a connection and an association or the list
   ends.  The FEPO's CEID component identifies the current associated
   master CE.

   Once the FE has associated with a master CE it moves to the post-
   association phase.  In the post-association phase, the master CE MAY
   update the list of backup CEs.  It MAY also instruct the FE to use a
   different master CE.  It is assumed that the master CE will
   communicate with other CEs within the NE for the purpose of
   synchronization via the CE-CE interface.  The CE-CE interface is out
   of scope for this document.

   While in the post-association phase, if the CE Failover Policy is set
   to 2 (High Availability without Graceful Restart) or 3 (High
   Availability with Graceful Restart) then the FE, after succesfully
   associating with the master CE, MUST attempt to connect and associate
   with all the CEs that it becomes aware of.  If it fails to connect or
   associate with some CEs, the FE MAY flag them as unreachable to avoid
   continuous attempts to connect.

   When the master CE for any reason is considered to be down, then the
   FE will try to find the first associated CE from the list of all CEs
   in a round-robin fashion.

   If the FE is unable to find an associated FE in its list of CEs, then
   it will attempt to connect and associate with the first from the list

   of all CEs and continue in a round-robin fashion until it connects
   and associates with a CE.

   "XXX: We need to discuss what should happen to CEs in the AllCEs list
   which an FE has attempted to connect or associate to but failed."

   Once connected and associated it assumes that the new associated CE
   is the new master CE and sets the FEPO CEID component's value with
   the new associated CE's ID.

   The FE then sends the Primary CE Down Event Notification to all
   associated CEs to notify them that the FE considers this CE as the
   new master CE.

   The new master CE MUST configure the CEID component of the FE within
   the time limit defined in the FEPO Failover Timeout as a confirmation
   that the FE made the right choice.

   XXX: We need to discuss what happenes if a CE doesn't respond within
   a FEPO Failover Timeout.

   If the CE the FE assumed to be the master discovers that it should
   not be the new master CE, then it will configure the CEID with the ID
   of the proper master CE.  How the CE decides who the new master CE
   is, is also out of scope of this document and is assumed to be done
   via a CE-CE communication protocol.

   In most High Availability architectures the split-brain issue is
   present.  However, since the FE will never accept any configuration
   messages from any other than the master CE, we consider the FE as
   fenced against data corruption from the other CEs that consider
   themselves as the master.  The split-brain issue is mostly a CE-CE
   communication problem and is considered to be out of scope.

   By virtue of having multiple CE connections, the FE switchover to a
   new master CE will be relatively much faster.  The overall effect is
   improving the NE recovery time in case of communication failure or
   faults of the master CE.

   For the sake of simplicity, the FE MUST respond to messages issued by
   only the master CE.  This simplifies the synchronization and avoids
   the concept of locking FE state.  The FE MUST drop any messages from
   backup CEs.  However, asynchronous events that the master CE has
   subscribed to and heartbeats are sent to all associated-to CEs.
   Packet redirects continue to be sent only to the master CE.  The
   Heartbeat Interval, the CEHB Policy and the FEHB Policy MUST apply to
   all CEs.

4.1.  Changes to the FEPO model

   In order for the above to be achievable there is a need to make a few
   changes in the FEPO model.  Appendix I contains the xml of the new
   version of the FEPO.

   Changes from the previous version are:

   1.  Addition of a new datatype, status (unsigned char) with special
       values 0 (Disconnected), 1 (Connected), 2 (Associated), 3
       (Lost_Connection) and 4 (Unreachable).

   2.  Change Component BackupCEs (9) to AllCEs and instead of an Array
       of unsigned integers, it MUST be an Array of unsigned integers
       (CEID) and unsigned char (status) for each CE.

   3.  Add two special values to the CEFailoverPolicyValues. 2 (High
       availability without Graceful restart) and 3 (High availability
       with Graceful restart).
