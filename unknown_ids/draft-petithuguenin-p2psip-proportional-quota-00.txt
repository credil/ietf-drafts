Internet-Draft             Proportional Quota                  June 2011


1.  Introduction

   The base specification of RELOAD defines two variables to set the
   storage quota.  The first one is the maximum size of an element of a
   specific kind, the second one is the maximum number of elements of a
   specific kind that can be stored on a specific Resource-ID.  The
   combination of the two variables permits to limit the quantity of
   data that a node have to store, as long as these kinds are also
   protected by an access control policy that restrict the number of
   Resource-IDs that can be used, which is the case for the three access
   control policies defined in the base document.

   For kinds that are used with an access control policy that does not
   restrict the Resource-IDs, a different algorithm is needed to force
   storing nodes to behave.  This document describes a quota algorithm
   that limits the number of elements of a specific kind that a node can
   store in the overlay, independently of the Resource-ID used.  Another
   way to look at this quota algorithm is that an entity must provide a
   number of peers that is proportional to the number of elements of a
   specific kind that this entity wants to store.

   It is important to understand that this quota works only for an
   overlay comprising only peers, so with a configuration file
   containing a <clients-permitted> element set to false.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Quota Algorithm

   A peer responsible for storing kinds using the quota algorithm
   described in this document MUST maintain a count of the number of
   unique entries being stored per storing peer for each kind.  This
   operation does not require to add a field containing the Node-ID as
   the Node-ID of the storing peer is always available in the signature
   field of each element stored.

   For example if a peer is storing 5 Resource-IDs and at each of those
   5 there are two keys whose first 16 bytes correspond to a particular
   Node-ID, it means this node is currently storing 10 unique dictionary
   entries for that Node-ID.

   When performing the quota checks for an entry, the peer starts by

   verifying that the size of the entry is consistent.  It then takes
   the <max-count> configuration parameter for this overlay, which
   measures the amount of entries of a specific kind a particular node
   can store when a <max-count-per>PEER</max-count-per> configuration
   parameter is also present.  That value is multiplied by by the number
   of replicas used by the topology plugin (i.e. 3 for Chord) and then
   divided by the fraction of the overlay owned by this peer.  If the
   result is less than one, it is rounded up to two.  This is the
   maximum number of unique entries that can be stored for this storing
   Node-ID.  If the peer is not yet storing this many entries for that
   Node-ID, the store is allowed.

   Note that when evaluating a Store Request containing multiple entries
   per kind, the count of unique entries used for the evaluation is
   incremented after each successful check, but the count will be reset
   to its initial value if one of the check fails.

   The algorithm takes in account only the duplications made by the
   topology plugin.  If another level of duplication is done at the
   application level, the <max-count> value must be adjusted
   accordingly.

   Note that because of imperfect distribution of Resource-IDs across
   the ring, new entries can be rejected even if the total count is
   under the limit.  It is the responsibility of the storing entity to
   calculate the maximum acceptable probability of rejection and to
   increase the number of peers accordingly.


4.  Overlay Configuration Document Extension

   This document extends the overlay configuration document by defining
   a new element in the "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:p2p:quota" namespace.

   The <max-count-per> element changes the meaning of the <max-count>
   variable.  The value "RESOURCE-ID" forces the <max-count> to be
   interpreted as been per Resource-ID, which is how the quota is used
   when this extension is not used.  The value "PEER" forces the <max-
   count> to be interpreted as been per peer, which is the algorithm
   defined by this document.

   The Compact Relax NG Grammar for this element is:

   namespace pqt = "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:p2p:quota"

   kind-parameter &= element pqt:max-count-per { max-count-per-type }
   max-count-per-type |= "RESOURCE-ID"
   max-count-per-type |= "PEER"

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds the following URN to the "XML Namespaces" class of
   the "IETF XML Registry":

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:p2p:quota

A.1.  Modifications between
      draft-petithuguenin-p2psip-proportional-quota-00 and
      draft-petithuguenin-vipr-reload-usage-00

   o  Instead of having a StorageQuota parameter that gives the maximum
      number of entries, reused the max-count parameter (that is
      mandatory anyway) and changes its meaning.
   o  Removed the 3x multiplier to account for the application layer
      COPY, as it is application specific.
   o  Removed the additional 3x multiplier to compensate for imperfect
      distribution, and moved the responsibility to the storing nodes.
