Internet-Draft              PCP DHCP Options                  March 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document defines DHCP [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315] options
   which can be used to provision a PCP Server [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]
   reachability information; more precisely it defines DHCP options to
   convey a FQDN (as per Section 3.1 of [RFC1035]) of a PCP Server.  In
   order to make use of these options, this document assumes that a DNS
   server is configured on the host client by DHCP or other means.

   The use of DHCP or DHCPv6 depends on the PCP deployment scenarios.

   In some deployment contexts, the PCP Server may be reachable with an
   IPv4 address but DHCPv6 is used to provision the PCP Client.  In such
   scenarios, a plain IPv4 address or an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address can be
   configured to reach the PCP Server.  As described in Section 3.1 of
   [I-D.wing-behave-dns64-config], dual-stack hosts can issue IPv4
   datagrams successfully to that IP address.


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  PCP Server: A functional element which receives and processes PCP
      requests from a PCP Client.  A PCP Server can be co-located or be
      separated from the function (e.g., NAT, Firewall) it controls.
      Refer to [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].

   o  PCP Client: a PCP software instance responsible for issuing PCP
      requests to a PCP Server.  Refer to [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].

   o  DHCP client (or client) denotes a node that initiates requests to
      obtain configuration parameters from one or more DHCP servers
      [RFC3315].

   o  DHCP server (or server) refers to a node that responds to requests
      from DHCP clients [RFC3315].


3.  Rationale

      [[Note: May be removed in future version of the I-D.]]

   Both IP address and FQDN DHCP options have been defined in previous
   versions of this document.  This flexibility aims to let service
   providers to make their own engineering choices and use the
   convenient option according to their deployment context.
   Nevertheless, DHC WG's position is this flexibility have some

Internet-Draft              PCP DHCP Options                  March 2011


   drawbacks such as inducing errors.  Therefore, only the FQDN option
   is maintained in this updated version.

   This choice of defining the FQDN option rather than the IP address is
   motivated by operational considerations: In particular, some service
   providers are considering two levels of redirection: (1) The first
   level is national-wise is undertaken by DHCP: a regional-specific
   FQDN will be returned; (2) The second level is done during the
   resolution of the regional-specific FQDN to redirect the customer to
   a regional PCP Servers among a pool deployed regionally.  Distinct
   operational teams are responsible for each of the above mentioned
   levels.  A clear separation between the functional perimeter of each
   team is a sensitive task for the maintenance of the offered services.
   Regional teams will require to introduce new resources (e.g., new
   PCP-controlled devices such as CGNs) to meet an increase of customer
   base.  The introduction of these new devices (addressing,
   redirection, etc.) is implemented locally.  Having this regional
   separation provides flexibility to manage portions of network
   operated by dedicated teams.  This two-level redirection can not be
   met by the IP Address option.

   In addition to the operational considerations:

   o  The use of the FQDN for NAT64 might be suitable for load-balancing
      purposes;

   o  For the DS-Lite case, if the encapsulation mode is used to send
      PCP messages, an IP address may be used (the ipv4-mapped IPv6
      address) since the AFTR selection is already done via the
      AFTR_NAME DHCPv6 option.  Of course, this assumes that the PCP
      Server is co-located with the AFTR function.  If these functions
      are not co-located, conveying the FQDN would be more convenient.

   If the PCP Server is located in a LAN, a simple FQDN such as "pcp-
   server.local" can be used.


4.  Consistent NAT and PCP Configuration

   The PCP Server discovered through DHCP MUST be able to install
   mappings on the appropriate upstream PCP-controlled device that will
   be crossed by packets issued by the host or any terminal belonging to
   the same realm (e.g., DHCP client is embedded in a CP router).  If
   DHCP is used to provision the FQDN of a PCP Server, an operator
   SHOULD configure appropriately DHCP servers to meet this requirement.
   In case this prerequisite is not met, customers would experience
   service troubles and their service(s) won't be delivered
   appropriately.

   Note that this constraint is implicitly met in scenarios where only
   one single PCP-controlled device is deployed in the network.


5.  DHCPv6 PCP Server Option

   This DHCPv6 option conveys a domain name to be used to retrieve the
   IP address of a PCP Server.  Appropriate DNS queries should be issued
   to resolve the conveyed FQDN.  In the context of a DS-Lite
   architecture [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], the retrieved
   address may be an IPv4 address or an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
   [RFC4291] of a PCP Server, and in the case of NAT64
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] an IPv6 address can be
   retrieved.

5.1.  Format

   The format of the DHCPv6 PCP Server option is shown in Figure 1.

                  Figure 1: PCP Server FQDN DHCPv6 Option

   The fields of the option shown in Figure 1 are as follows:

   o  Option-code: OPTION_PCP_SERVER (TBA, see Section 8)

   o  Option-length: Length of the 'PCP Server Domain Name' field in
      octets.

   o  PCP Server Domain Name: The domain name of the PCP Server to be
      used by the PCP Client.  The domain name is encoded as specified
      in Section 8 of [RFC3315].

5.2.  Client Behaviour

   To discover a PCP Server [I-D.ietf-pcp-base], the DHCPv6 client MUST
   include an Option Request Option (ORO) requesting the DHCPv6 PCP
   Server FQDN option (i.e., include OPTION_PCP_SERVER on its
   OPTION_ORO) as described in Section 22.7 of [RFC3315].  A client MAY
   also include the OPTION_DNS_SERVERS option on its OPTION_ORO to

Internet-Draft              PCP DHCP Options                  March 2011


   retrieve a DNS servers list.

   If the DHCPv6 client receives more than one OPTION_PCP_SERVER option
   from the DHCPv6 server, it MUST discard all instances of that option.

   Upon receipt of an OPTION_PCP_SERVER option, the DHCPv6 client MUST
   verify that the option length (including the Option-length octet))
   does not exceed 256 octets [RFC1035]).  The DHCPv6 client MUST verify
   the FQDN is a properly encoded as detailed in Section 8 of [RFC3315].

   Once the FQDN conveyed in a OPTION_PCP_SERVER option is validated,
   the DHCPv6 client issues appropriate DNS Query messages using the
   provided FQDN to resolve a AAAA Resource Record or A RR Resource
   Record.  AAAA and A Queries may be issued in parallel or sequentially
   (e.g., using [RFC3484] selection process).

   If the DNS response contains more than one IPv6/IPv4 address, the PCP
   Client MUST use the procedure defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] for the
   address selection.  The PCP Client MUST NOT send PCP requests to more
   than one IP address at the same time.

   It is RECOMMENDED to associate a TTL with any address resulting from
   resolving the FQDN conveyed in a OPTION_PCP_SERVER DHCPv6 option when
   stored in a local cache.  Considerations on how to flush out a local
   cache are out of the scope of this document.

5.3.  Server Behaviour

   A DHCPv6 server MUST NOT reply with a value for the OPTION_PCP_SERVER
   if the DHCPv6 client has not explicitly included OPTION_PCP_SERVER in
   its OPTION_ORO.

   If OPTION_PCP_SERVER option is requested by the DHCPv6 client, DHCPv6
   server MUST NOT send more than one OPTION_PCP_SERVER option in the
   response.  The DHCPv6 server MUST include only one FQDN in a
   OPTION_PCP_SERVER option.  The DHCPv6 server MUST NOT include an FQDN
   having a length exceeding 256 octets.


6.  DHCP PCP Option

   The PCP Server DHCP option can be used to configure a FQDN to be used
   by the PCP Client to contact a PCP Server.  The generic format of
   this option is illustrated in Figure 2.

   Because of the depletion of DHCP option codes and in order to
   anticipate future PCP-related DHCP options, the proposed option uses
   a sub-option field.

   The fields of the PCP Server Domain Name sub-option shown in Figure 4
   are:

   o  Sub-option Code: 1.

   o  Len: Length of the "PCP Server Domain Name" field in octets.

   o  PCP Server Domain Name: The domain name of the PCP Server to be
      used by the PCP Client.  The encoding of the domain name is
      described in Section 3.1 of [RFC1035].

   When the PCP Server Domain Name Sub-option is used, the client issues
   a DNS A record query to retrieve the IPv4 address(es) of the PCP
   server(s).

      [[Note: aside effect of having the sub-option format is the risk
      to have a large option exceeding the maximum permissible within a
      single option (254 octets+the length octets).  A solution would be
      to recommend [RFC3396]?]]

   The security considerations in [RFC2131], [RFC3315] and
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] are to be considered.


8.  IANA Considerations
