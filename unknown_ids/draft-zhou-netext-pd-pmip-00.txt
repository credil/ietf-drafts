Internet-Draft   Prefix Delegation for Proxy Mobile IPv6    January 2011


1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 prefix delegation rfc3633 (DHCPv6PD) can be used to assign a
   prefix or prefix(es) to a Mobile Router.  If a MR is provided Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 Protocol as its mobility management when connecting the
   network, currently neither the MAG nor the LMA can be able to
   identify the packet including delegated prefix(es).  When the MR
   (Requesting Router) uses DHCPv6PD to obtain the delegated prefix(es),
   these prefix(es) SHOULD be associated with the PMIP binding, or the
   relevant packets may be discarded by the MAG or the LMA.  This
   document describes extension to PMIP for supporting prefix
   delegation.

2.  Protocol Overview

   Two DHCPv6 prefix delegation deployment configurations are as
   following

   o  DHCPv6 relay agent co-located with the mobile access gateway.

   o  DHCPv6 server co-located with the mobile access gateway.

   The MN (requesting router) MUST obtain the home network prefix before
   initiating the DHCPv6 prefix delegation procedure.

2.1.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Co-located with the MAG

   This section gives explanation on protocol operation in the case of
   DHCPv6 relay agent being located in the MAG.

   In this scenario, the procedure of DHCPv6 prefix delegation is
   transparent to the LMA.  Upon receiving the DHCPv6 REPLY message from
   the delegating router the MAG SHOULD explicitly notify the LMA that
   the delegated prefix(es) need to be associated with current binding
   via sending a Proxy Binding Update message.

     Figure 1: Case of DHCPv6 relay located at MAG for PMIP supporting
                             prefix delegation

   The steps of the procedure in Figure 1 are as following.

   1.  The PMIPv6 tunnel is set up between the MAG and LMA.  The MAG
   plays function of DHCPv6 relay agent between the MN and the DHCPv6
   server.

   2.  The MN which acts as a !oRequesting Router!+/- as described in
   rfc3633 sends DHCPv6 SOLICIT massage including one or more IA_PD
   option(s) to the MAG to acquire the delegated prefix(es).  The DHCPv6
   relay agent on the MAG as described in rfc3315 relays the DHCPv6
   SOLICIT message to the delegation router.  The LMA can be aware of
   the DHCPv6 message which is transported through the LMA.

   3.  The delegating router inserts one or more IA_PD option(s)
   including the delegated prefix(es) and send it to the MAG (DHCPv6
   relay agent) via the DHCPv6 ADVERTIZE message.  The MAG relays the
   DHCPv6 ADVERTIZE message to the MN.

Internet-Draft   Prefix Delegation for Proxy Mobile IPv6    January 2011


   4.  The MN sends DHCPv6 REQUEST message with the IA_PD option(s)
   received from previous message to the MAG (DHCPv6 relay agent).  The
   MAG relays the DHCPv6 REQUEST message to the delegating router.  The
   delegating router responses the REQUEST to the MAG via DHCPv6 REPLY
   message.

   5.  Upon receiving the DHCPv6 REPLY message, the MAG notifies the
   delegated prefix(es) to the LMA by sending Proxy Binding Update
   message.  A new mobility option, the Delegated Prefix Notify Option,
   is defined to include the delegated prefix(es), see section 3.1.

   6.  On reception of the PBU containing the Delegated Prefix Notify
   Option the LMA SHOULD add the delegated prefix(es) into the Binding
   Cache and include the Delegated Prefix Reply Option which is a new
   mobility option (see section 3.2) in the Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement message to confirm binding of the delegated
   prefix(es).

   7.  After receiving the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message the MAG
   SHOULD add the delegated prefix(es) into the Binding Update List
   locally.  The MAG SHOULD not relay the DHCPv6 REPLY message to the MN
   until receiving the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement from the LMA.

   8.  The MN receives one or more IA_PD prefix(es) in the DHCPv6 REPLY
   message from the MAG.

2.2.  DHCPv6 Server Co-located with the MAG

   This section explains how PMIPv6 support DHCPv6 prefix delegation in
   the deployment of delegating router located at the mobile access
   gateway, see Figure 3.

     Figure 2: DHCPv6 server located at MAG for PMIP supporting prefix
                                delegation

   The steps of the procedure in Figure 2 are as following.

   1.  The PMIPv6 tunnel is set up between the MAG and LMA.  The MAG
   plays function of delegating router.

   2.  The MN which acts as a !oRequesting Router!+/- as described in
   rfc3633 sends DHCPv6 SOLICIT massage including one or more IA_PD
   option(s) to the MAG which acts as a !oDelegating Router!+/- to
   acquire the delegated prefix(es).

   3.  The Delegating Router on the MAG as described in rfc3633 inserts
   one or more IA_PD option(s) including the delegated prefix(es) and
   send it to the MN via the DHCPv6 ADVERTIZE message.

   4.  The MN sends DHCPv6 REQUEST message to the MAG with the IA_PD
   option(s) received from previous message.

   5.  Before sending the DHCPv6 REPLY message to the MN the MAG SHOULD
   send the Proxy Binding Update message to the LMA to notify the
   association between the delegated prefix(es) and the binding.  A new
   mobility option, the Delegated Prefix Option, is defined to contain
   the delegated prefix(es) in the PBU, see section 3.1.

   6.  On reception of the PBU containing the Delegated Prefix Option
   the LMA SHOULD add the delegated prefix(es) into the Binding Cache
   and insert a Delegated Prefix Reply Option which is a new option
   defined in section 3.2 into the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message
   to confirm binding of the delegated prefix(es).  After receiving the
   Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message the MAG SHOULD add the
   delegated prefix(es) into the Binding Update List locally.  The MAG
   SHOULD not send the DHCPv6 REPLY message to the MN until receiving
   the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement from the LMA.

   7.  The MN receives one or more IA_PD prefix(es) in the DHCPv6 REPLY
   message from the MAG.

3.  Mobility Option

3.1.  Delegated Prefix Notify Option

   A new mobility option, Delegated Prefix Notify Option, is defined for
   use in the Proxy Binding Update sent by the MAG to the LMA.  This
   option can be used to notify the LMA the delegated prefix(es)
   assigned to the MN.  If there are more than one delegated prefix
   needing to be associated with the binding, more than one options are
   included in the Proxy Binding Update message.

   The Delegated Prefix Notify Option has an alignment requirement of
   8n+4.  Its format is as follows:

        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   excluding the type and length fields.  This field MUST be set to 18.

   Status

   Indicates success or failure for associating the delegated prefix
   with the binding.  Values from 0 to 127 indicate success.  Higher
   values (128 to 255) indicate failure.

   Prefix Length

   8-bit unsigned integer the value is copied from the corresponding
   field of the Delegated Prefix Reply Option.

4.  Local Mobility Anchor Operation

4.1.  Processing Proxy Binding Update

   All the considerations from Section 5.3.1 of rfc5213 MUST be applied
   on the encapsulated Proxy Binding Update message.  Upon receiving the
   Proxy Binding Update message containing Delegated Prefix Notify
   Option, the local mobility anchor MUST add the delegated prefix(es)
   in its binding cache.

   The local mobility anchor MUST send the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   message with the Status field value set to 0.  The message MUST be
   constructed as specified in Section x.x.x.

4.2.  Forwarding Considerations

   Once the local mobility anchor receives the packet from the
   corresponding node whose destination IPv6 address belonging to the
   delegated prefix, the local mobility anchor SHOULD treat the packet
   as treating the ones with home network prefix.  The local mobility
   SHOULD encapsulate the packet and send it to the mobile access
   gateway through the PMIPv6 bi-directional tunnel.

5.  Mobile Access Gateway Operation

5.1.  Forwarding Considerations

   Once the mobile access gateway receives an IPv6 packet whose
   destination IPv6 address belonging to the delegated prefix from the
   mobile node, the mobile access gateway SHOULD encapsulate the packet
   and send it to the local mobility anchor through the PMIPv6 bi-
   directional tunnel.
