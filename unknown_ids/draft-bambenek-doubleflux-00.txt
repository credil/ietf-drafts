1.  Introduction

   Traditionally, malware repositories and malicious websites were easy
   to locate and take down. They were either registered in DNS or used
   their IP address. A call or e-mail to the abuse department and the 
   relevant ISP is (usually) all that was needed. With the advent of
   botnets, this all changed.

   Botnet technology changed the paradigm for hacking. Instead of 
   controlling only a few machines and using those machines as 
   launching pads for attacks, malicious individuals could control 
   hundreds, thousands, or even more machines that they could then use
   to initiate more attacks. Identifying all the botnet "drones"
   became difficult simply by the shear volume. Even after machines

   were identified, they frequently would just get reinfected. The 
   attention then turned to botnet command and control structures.

   This lead to the development of fast flux networks which allow
   leverging the shear numbers of infected machines and DNS to quickly
   point and repoint victims to malicious websites and command and
   control mechanisms.

2.  Overview of Fast Flux Service Networks

   Fast flux service networks work by using a combination of short
   Time-To-Live (TTL) values and round-robin IP address assignments
   in DNS records for a given domain. This leads to DNS resource 
   records having IP address that are changing quickly which make
   takedowns difficult. Fast flux networks come in two varieties:
   single flux which only rotate A records for web services and 
   double flux which rotate DNS records as well as A records for
   web services. [1]

   Fast flux networks rely on many machines that have been
   compromised that can be used as "throwaway" hosts for further
   exploitation or launching pads for their own attacks.

2.1. Single Flux

   In a single flux network, there are up to thousands of IP
   addresses that can coorespond to a single A record. For instace,
   at any given moment, a round-robin list of IP address can be
   returned for a query of www.malicioushost.com. However, those
   values will have low TTLs assigned to them (as low as 3 minutes).
   A future query will then return different IP addresses. This 
   allows malicious individuals to use DNS to point victims to 
   malware and command & control systems without having to worry
   about the IP address being identified and taken offline. With
   thousands of IPs to choose from, taking down the individual
   hosts becomes quickly impractical. The one weak point in this
   network is the nameservers that are authoritative for the
   domain are static and they can be taken down which would,
   in turn, disable the fast flux network.

2.2. Double Flux

   The weak point in single flux networks is addressed in double
   flux networks. In this case, double flux also use low TTLs
   to quickly cycle the authoritative nameservers as well so
   take downs of the nameserver also become difficult. They can 
   accomplish this by using low TTLs for the NS records
   themselves, or using a fully-qualified domain name in the NS

   record with has a cooresponding A record with a low TTL. This
   allows malicious users to cycle in owned machines as both
   webservers and nameservers.
 
3.  Recommended Changes

   In order to mitigate the threat of double flux service networks
   a variety of changes to the standard are proposed. The changes
   will affect a variety of levels so that if some of the changes
   are not implemented at certain levels, some protection will be
   afforded to consumers through the other levels.

3.1. Changes to Registrars

   Domain registrars SHALL limit the rate at which changes can be
   made to authoritative DNS servers for domains within their control
   to one set of changes per 72 hours. They SHOULD also allow for a
   "backout" to the previous settings in the event of errors. This
   backout will move the settings back to the previous nameserver 
   settings and reset the clock for 72 hours. This will prevent
   malicious individuals from constantly changing their DNS records
   to avoid takedowns.

3.2. Changes to Authoritative DNS Services

   During startup, DNS services SHALL check both the TTL for NS
   records and check the TTL for the A records associated with the
   NS record. If the TTL is set to a value below 86400 (24 hours) it
   SHALL override the setting to 259200 (72 hours) and record an
   entry in the system logs to that affect. A value MAY be specified
   within 24-72 hours that will work, but values under 24 hours
   will default to 72 hours.

3.3. Changes to DNS Resolving Services

   DNS servers that are non-authoritative but performing queries on
   behalf of local clients SHALL examine the TTL of the NS record and
   if applicable, the A record for the cooresponding nameserver.
   If either non-cached TTL comes back with a value of less than
   12 hours, it SHALL be discarded and return an error giving no
   information to the requesting client.

3.4. Changes to DNS Clients

   DNS clients SHALL examine returned values for all nameserver

Internet-Draft       Double Flux Defense in DNS             March 2008

   lookups for NS records (and cooresponding A records for those
   NS records) for TTLs less than 12 hours. If a non-cached result
   of a query comes back with a low TTL, it SHALL be discarded with
   no IP address returned to the requesting application.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document proposes changes to the DNS protocol to improve 
   security in the existing system. It will not prevent misuse, but it
   will help slow down the propogation of malicious DNS changes to
   allow for the information security community to take appropriate
   corrective action. This should theoretically enhance the security
   of DNS services.

5.  IANA Consdierations

   There are no implications for IANA in this document.

6.  Conclusion

   The changes to the standards proposed in this document allow for
   the information security field to slow down the movement of double
   flux networs so that takedowns become more possible. It will not
   fix the problem, nor does it intend to. The objective is to raise
   the bar and prevent the malicious use of features within the DNS
   protocol that are no longer relevant to modern usage.

   Additionally, this author encourages the development of a
   real-time DNS Blacklist of known fast-flux domain names to provide
   an additional layer of protection that service providers can use
   to protect their consumers.
