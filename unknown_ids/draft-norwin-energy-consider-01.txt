             Considerations for Power and Energy Management
                    draft-norwin-energy-consider-01

Abstract

   With rising cost and an increasing awareness of the environmental
   impact of energy consumption, a desirable feature of networked
   devices is to be able to assess their power state and energy
   consumption at will.  With this data available, one can build
   sophisticated applications such as monitoring applications or even
   active energy management systems.  These systems themselves are out
   of scope of this memo, as it discusses only considerations for the
   monitored devices.  Implementation specifics such as the definition
   of a Management Information Base are also outside the scope of this
   document.

2.  Overview/Goals

   This document aims at framing discussions on power and energy
   management within the IETF and recording their results.  To this end,
   it clarifies terminology that is routinely used to have multiple
   contrary meanings, which results in unnecessary confusion.  The
   document further describes how energy and power reporting differs
   from other reporting tasks that have been defined by the IETF (e.g.
   IPFIX) and the resulting implications for mechanisms the IETF will
   define in the future.  This document is intended to be a living
   document that also captures why certain decisions were made in the
   process of defining power and energy management mechanisms.

   Another goal is to cover use cases that go beyond the traditional
   IETF ones to keep emerging standards open with respect to diverse
   product types.  Participating entities are monitoring systems that
   receive information and networked devices that provide information on
   energy consumption and power state information concerning themselves
   or potentially also other devices.  Not in the scope of this memo are
   means for controlling the energy consumption and the power state of
   monitored devices; we focus on power monitoring and basic identity
   only.  It is assumed that most devices will manage their own power
   state.  This may be informed by external devices, by proprietary and
   standardized solutions (that are or will become available), or as a
   consequence of functional applications.

3.  Scope of Devices

   All devices that have a network connection should be in scope.  While
   first adopters will surely be devices such as switches, routers, and
   servers (some of which already report power levels and power state
   through proprietary means), in the future networked electronic
   devices, appliances, and even lights will also need such capability.
   These devices may have different ways of accomplishing discovery and
   management for functional purposes, but will share the common energy
   and power reporting capability.  While some devices will directly
   measure power, other devices will not be able to measure their power,
   but may be able to reliably estimate it.  These devices are still in
   scope.

   This document does not address the power consumption levels of
   internal components of a product, only the energy inputs to the
   entire product (and net consumption if it provides power to other
   products).

4.  Terminology

4.1.  Power States

   We synonymously use the terms Power Mode and Power State; named modes
   are general categories only, not individual states with highly-
   specific meaning.

   Discussions about energy consumptions and device power states are
   often confusing as different products define states such as "standby"
   quite differently.  Even the same class of devices often implement
   named states differently.  Named power states are intrinsically
   difficult to define consistently as they imply not only something
   about a device's energy consumption but also something about the
   device's capabilities in that state, and are implementation-
   dependent.  All of this makes highly-specific named modes unsuitable
   for use in a general context.  The term with by far the most
   different definitions is "standby" and so we therefore deliberately
   do not refer to standby in this document.  We believe that the three
   named power state categories, on, off and sleep, are broadly
   understood.  These mode categories may each contain a large set of
   power sub-states.  A fourth basic power state of 'ready' may be more
   appropriate for some devices, particularly appliances.

   In general, devices that are asleep will be able to wake quickly and
   will retain network connectivity.  Devices that are off usually take
   much more time to turn on than the wake time and usually lack network
   connectivity.  Devices that are on are fully functional but
   potentially with reduced performance.

4.2.  Power Levels

   The power level of a device is its current electricity demand.  It is
   an important complement to power mode, providing articulation of
   power level within the basic mode.  It also avoids the need for a
   large number of named modes.  Basic modes are distinguished by
   important functional differences or power levels.  Core power modes
   are an abstraction from individual implementations.

4.3.  Devices

   The organizing unit for power is a single device with one or more
   power sources.  The term "product" is sometimes used as a synonym,
   and also covers the case in which a device proxies network presence
   including power reporting for a second device.

5.  Energy Manangement

   First and foremost, the task of power and energy management is
   reporting.  While a more active role in energy management is
   conceivable by e.g. putting devices into power states based on
   policies or other predefined schemes at a network management system
   (NMS).

5.1.  Control

   There should not be an assumption that power state management of
   devices is done externally/centrally.  Ideally most devices will
   manage their own power state, implementing distributed intelligence.
   The control function is accomplished separately from power reporting.
   A core mechanism many devices will use to manage power consumption is
   a price (and price forecast) for electricity.

5.2.  Identity

   All devices on a network need to expose identity to others.  While
   some protocols accomplish this for particular applications or
   contexts, it is desirable to have a simple universal mechanism.  This
   is particularly true for devices that may have a fairly limited
   degree of participation in the network, such as appliances.  This
   mechanism should directly or indirectly reveal the brand/model of the
   device, and possible a URL to further information about the device.
   An example of this is the "Universal Product Code" on many products.
   Subsequent documents should identify the appropriate mechanism to
   accomplish this, e.g. an existing MIB.

   An energy management application could then obtain current energy use
   for a device like a refrigerator, and compare it to what it is
   expected to use under normal operation, and alert the building
   manager if it is significantly out of range.  This also can be used
   to quickly inventory energy-using products in a building, and to
   summarize by product type where energy is being used.

5.3.  NMS Considerations

   A Network Management System is an entity which collects energy and
   power reporting data and uses it for advanced applications.  One such
   application correlates energy consumption with other metrics to
   display efficiency metrics (like watthours/bit).  An NMS can also set
   device policies to control larger networked systems such as a data
   center.

   An NMS will query energy MIB data on a periodic basis, with that
   period dictated by its needs, possibly being dynamic.  MIBs should



Nordman & Winter         Expires April 28, 2011                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               Consider Energy                October 2010


   provide an energy "meter reading" to allow computing of energy use
   for any period.  Thus, the NMS does most of the work to generate time
   series energy data, and this minimizes burden on the host and the
   complexity of the Power MIB.

   The core function of power monitoring is to maintain meters of energy
   use and of time in different power states (and through summing, total
   energy and time).  The second is to be able to report current power
   consumption and power state.

5.4.  Proxy Considerations

   Devices usually will report on their own input power, but may also
   report Power supplied to other devices.  Those other devices may also
   have an IP address and so report some information themselves.  Other
   devices may not have an IP presence and so all information will be
   from the proxy.

5.5.  MIB Considerations

   The MIB should be generic as there are a large number of devices yet
   to come and power states are and will become more diverse.

   The MIB should be structured so that the smallest possible set of
   values/information is applicable to a large range of devices, can be
   implemented efficiently and is extensible to accommodate additional
   information objects.  As an example, many devices will not be battery
   powered but it should be easy to add battery monitoring to the basic
   set of energy-related information.

5.6.  Power Considerations

   Reporting should cover both AC and DC power sources.  However, other
   types should be provided for, and the type of energy is one of the
   reported values.  Standard low-voltage DC (e.g.  USB, Power over
   Ethernet, eMerge) is immediately useful.  A core set of values should
   be available from any device that implements the Power MIB at all so
   that an NMS can quickly obtain and aggregate uniform data for all
   devices.

   There is a fundamental distinction between supplied power from a
   device And input power to a device, notably losses that occur in
   transmission, as well as other (possibly unknown) devices that are
   also using the power.  The effect of internal batteries is not
   revealed by the MIB, as it only reports on net power into or out of a
   device.

   It is tempting to add a lot of descriptive information (e.g. on

   highly specific power states and periodic energy consumption) into
   the MIB; however, this information will greatly vary across device
   types.

5.7.  Power State Monitoring

   For the device power state, the following information is considered
   to be relevant:

   o  the current state

   o  the time of (or time since) the last change

   o  the current real power (energy consumption rate)

   o  accumulated energy consumption

5.8.  Power Distribution

   Wired networks enable power distribution that is co-incident with
   network Communication.  However, many devices will not communicate on
   the same Medium that they are powered on, or may lack connectivity
   entirely (though with the power provider knowing of their identity).
   Devices can report power for another device only if they are the
   entity providing the power.

6.  Use Context and Use Cases

   The following are some use contexts that this facility is intended
   for.  These are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and a device can
   report the same data regardless of the context.

   o  A data center, with a NMS which is integrated with application
      functionality, and also manages energy use.

   o  A commercial building, in which the energy reporting is separate
      from any management of devices, and more as background to help
      understand building operation (including occupancy) and identify
      inefficiencies or equipment failures.

   o  A house, which shares some of the commercial building
      characteristics, but with different management approach and
      security concerns.

   o  A vehicle, which uses the reporting only for automatic management,
      not for reporting to the user.

   Use cases include a facility manager or an NMS in an automated
   fashion:

   o  Understand costs for billing purposes.

   o  Assess savings potentials.

   o  Identify possible device malfunctions.

   o  Reveal unexpected usage patterns.

   o  Plan for future capacity needs.

   o  Understand heat production in a building or space.

   o  A NMS which deals with draws on current power use to deal with an
      actual or potential shortfall in power supply.

7.  Outstanding Questions and Future Directions

   Questions that need to be answered in the course of developing RFCs
   for energy management include:

   o  What unit(s) of measurement should the MIB use?

   Future directions include:

   o  other energy media such as wireless power, non-electric energy
      (e.g. natural gas)

   o  support for devices with multiple power sources (the initial MIB
      should cover only the total input power).
