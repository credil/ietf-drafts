Abstract 

   This document describes the general problem of network stratum query 
   for application optimization. Network Stratum query is an ability to 
   query the network from an application controller such as those used 
   in Data Centers so that application controller decisions such as 
   server assignment or virtual machine instantiation/migration could be 
   performed with better knowledge of the underlying network conditions.  

   As application servers are distributed geographically across Data 
   Centers, many application-related decisions such as which server to 
   assign a new client or where to instantiate/migrate virtual machines 
   will suffer from sub-optimality unless the underlying network 
   conditions are factored in the decision process. The lack of network 
   awareness may result in not meeting the end-user service objective 
   for some key applications like video gaming/conferencing that require 
   stringent latency and bandwidth requirement.

1. Introduction 

   Cross Stratum Optimization is a joint optimization effort in 
   allocating resources to end-users that involves both the Application 
   Stratum and Network Stratum.  

   The application stratum is the functional block which manages and 
   controls application resources and provides application resources to 
   a variety of clients/end-users. Application resources are non-network 
   resources critical to achieving the application service

   functionality. Examples include: application specific servers, 
   storage, content, large data sets, and computing power. Data Centers 
   are regarded as tangible realization of the application stratum 
   architecture.   

   The network stratum is the functional block which manages and 
   controls network resources and provides transport of data between 
   clients/end-users to and among application resources. Network 
   Resources are resources of any layer 3 or below (L1/L2/L3) such as 
   bandwidth, links, paths, path processing (creation, deletion, and 
   management), network databases, path computation, admission control, 
   and resource reservation capability.  

   Application services offered by Data Centers by their very nature 
   utilize application resources (e.g., servers, storage, memory, 
   etc...) in Data Centers, and the underlying network resources 
   provided by LANs, MANs, and carrier's transport networks.  

   As the application servers are distributed geographically across many 
   Data Centers, decisions such as server assignment or new virtual 
   machine instantiation will suffer from sub-optimality unless the 
   underlying network conditions are factored in the decision process. 
   The lack of network awareness may result in not meeting the end-user 
   service objective for some key applications like video 
   gaming/conferencing that require stringent latency and bandwidth 
   requirement.   

   This document describes the general problem of network stratum query 
   (NS Query) in Data Center environments. Network Stratum query is an 
   ability to query the network from application controller in Data 
   Centers so that application server instantiation decision would be 
   jointly performed based on both the application resource/load status 
   and the network resource/load status.  

   The NS query is different from typical "horizontal" query 
   capabilities in the network. The horizontal query in the network is 
   carried by the head end (i.e., data source) that would "probe" the 
   network to test the capabilities for data flows to/from particular 
   point in the network. This is a horizontal scheme.  

   NS Query is a two-stage query that consists of two stages: 

     . A vertical query capability where an external point (i.e., the 
        Application Control Gateway (ACG) in Data Center) will query 
        the network (i.e., the Network Control Gateway (NCG)); and

     . A horizontal query capability where the NCG to gather the 
        collective information of a variety of horizontal schemes 
        (IPPM, IGP, RIB, etc.) implemented in the network stratum.  

   NS Query does not re-invent the wheel on existing network 
   capabilities but tries to reuse them where possible.  

2. Network Contexts  

   Figure 1 shows a typical data center architecture where an end-user 
   (the point of consuming resource) needs to be connected for its 
   application (e.g., gaming) to a server located in one of the data 
   centers geographically spread.

   Figure 1 shows that the user application can be served by any of the 
   servers in DC1, DC2 and DC3. When the initial request arrives to the 
   proxy server in DC1, the proxy server (aka, the load balancer) would 
   ideally assign an "optimal" server based on both server resource/load 
   status and the network resources/load status. This server assignment 
   decision today, however, is limited due to the lack of network 
   awareness in this decision making process in the application.  

   For example, the server close to the user in Data Center 1 may find a 
   good server that can serve the application. Assume that this 
   particular application requires x amount of minimum bandwidth 
   guarantee and with less than y ms of latency limit. The route that 
   serves Data Center 1 traffic to the end-user (PE1 - PE4) may not have 
   enough capacity at a moment of service instantiation and therefore 
   the service objective of the end-user may not be satisfied had such 
   route been taken.  

   On the other hand, there may be good servers available in Data 
   Centers 2 and 3 and their routes (PE2-PE4 and PE3-PE4) may have 
   enough capacity to meet the service requirement.  

   This example illustrates the benefit of and the need for the joint 
   optimization across the application and network strata. NS Query is 
   the ability to query the network from an application to collect a 
   certain level of network information. No such mechanisms exist in the 
   today's Internet Protocol technologies. 

   Figure 2 shows the context of NS Query in a more detail within the 
   overarching data center architecture shown in Figure 1.

                      Figure 2. NS Query Architecture 

   Figure 2 shows key architectural components that enable NS Query 
   capability. The Application Control Gateway (ACG) is the proxy 
   gateway that interfaces with network and generate queries to network. 
   The ACG can query various metric values that may contribute to 
   meeting the overall service objective of an application. This is a 
   vertical query (Stage 1).  

   In the network stratum, the Network Control Gateway (NCG) serves as 
   the proxy gateway to the network. The NCG receives the query request 
   from the ACG, probes the network to test the capabilities for data 
   flow to/from particular point in the network, and gather the 
   collective information of a variety of horizontal schemes (IPPM, 
   IGP, MIB, TED, etc.) implemented in the network stratum. This is a 
   horizontal query (Stage 2).

Internet-Draft           Network Stratum Query             October 2010 
    

   Further, the NCG provides the responses to the original query sent 
   from the ACG. The data collected by the NCG needs to be abstracted. 
   This abstraction is needed on two grounds.  

   First, the network does not usually reveal its details to the 
   outside entity. Although the Data Center providers and the carriers 
   are business partners in providing application services to the end-
   users and to the application providers (e.g., gaming providers), 
   detail network data may not be leaked to the Data Centers, and vice 
   versa.   

   Second, detail network data may not be understood by the 
   application. Link or node level data in and of themselves may not 
   help the application to process the detail data. For instance, 
   latency or bandwidth on a link level is too detail for application 
   to handle. Instead, latency or bandwidth on a route level (i.e., PE1 
   - PE4 in Figure 1) will help the application make its server 
   selection/instantiation decision.  

   The abstraction function needs to be provided by the NCG. Note that 
   NCG plays a head end role within the network probing/collecting 
   network performance/management data (e.g., IPPM, MIB, etc.) or 
   routing data [MRT] (e.g., LSDB, TED, BGP-RIB, etc.) and others. Once 
   the basic data is collected, the NCG will need to abstract/summary 
   before it sends to the application.  

 

3. Problem Statement 

   The current state-of-the art probing schemes from an external point 
   are based on ping or trace route like mechanisms based on the 
   assumption that the underlying transport network is L3 network and 
   that the routing is simple IP forwarding. 

   In reality, the carrier's routing schemes are likely to include IP 
   tunneling or MPLS tunneling on top of or in place of IP forwarding. 
   In some cases, the actual network may be VPN, MPLS-TE or GMPLS-TE 
   networks where trace route does not work.  

   This implies that network status estimation technique made from 
   application stratum cannot be accurate. Thus, application resource 
   allocation to end-users can suffer sub-optimality and fail to meet 
   performance objective for the application.   

   Currently, there is no standard "vertical" probing scheme that allows 
   an application control gateway in Data Center to query network

   stratum in a way suitable for a third party (i.e. an entity "outside" 
   the network). 

   In the network stratum, there is no mechanism for "a whole network 
   query of information at the network-stratum." A whole network query 
   is "a query to gather the topology of the network, the bandwidth 
   availability for the routes of interest, the capabilities and 
   congestion of links and routes, and an indication of the contribution 
   to delay and jitter that each link and route will contribute."  

   Note that there are existing mechanisms in the network such as IPPM, 
   PCE, PCN, IGP, etc. that can be reused for this purpose.  

   Further, even if the whole network query of information is available, 
   there is no abstraction mechanism today in the network stratum to 
   avoid the details of such information such as topology, link 
   bandwidth availability, latency, packet loss, etc., to the outside 
   entity. This warrants some works on abstraction from network side to 
   preserve the privacy of network stratum details from the application 
   stratum.  

    

4. High-level requirements 

   This section discusses high-level requirements to support NS Query in 
   the Data Center environments. 


4.1. Data Center-Network Stratum Communication (NS Query) 
   The ACG plays the key role functioning as an application gateway to 
   network and runs the NS Query. The ACG has access to the end-user 
   profile for the application and the candidate servers' locations 
   locally and remotely located. How the ACG access these information is 
   beyond the scope of this work.  


4.1.1. Application Profile  
   The application Stratum needs to provide the application profile to 
   network.  

   Example service profile information that can be useful to network to 
   understand is as follows: 

      . End user IP address; 

      . User access router IP address;

Internet-Draft           Network Stratum Query             October 2010 
    

      . Authentication Profile: Authentication Key; 

      . Bandwidth Profile: Minimum bandwidth required for the 
        application; 

      . Connectivity Profile: P-P, P-MP, Anycast (Multi-destination); 

      . Directionality of the connectivity: unidirectional, bi-
        directional; 

      . Path Estimation Objective Function: Min latency, etc. 

   Additional profile information can be added depending on the network 
   capability.  

   

4.1.2. Network Load Data to be queried  

   For a given location mapping information (i.e., from the server 
   location to end-user location), the query can ask the following 
   network load data: 

     . Type of networks and the technical capabilities of the networks; 
     . Bandwidth capabilities and availability; 
     . latency; 
     . jitter;  
     . packet loss; 
     . And other Network Performance Objective (NPO) as defined in 
        section 5 of [ITU-T Y.1541]. 
    

   Note that this can be asked in a different way. For example, the 
   query can simply ask:  

     . Can you give me if you can route x amount of b/w (from server to 
       end-user) within y ms of latency?  
     . Can you give me if you can route x amount of b/w (from server to 
       end-user) with no packet loss?

4.1.3. Responses to NS Query from network to application  
  Given the network query from application, the network should provide 
  the following mechanisms:   
   
  - For a given location mapping information from application (i.e., 
     from the server location to end-user location), network needs to 
     derive its network graph and estimate the asked data (e.g., 
     latency, b/w available, packet loss, etc.)  
   
  Note: How to estimate by network is beyond the scope of this work and 
  should be addressed in other pertinent WGs.
