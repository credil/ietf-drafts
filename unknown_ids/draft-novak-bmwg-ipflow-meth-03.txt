Internet-Draft        Flow Monitoring Benchmarking          July 2009

1.  Introduction

    Monitoring of IP flows (Flow Monitoring) on network devices is a
    widely used application that has numerous uses in both service
    provider and enterprise segments as detailed in the Requirements for  
    IP Flow Information Export [RFC3917]. 

    Flow Monitoring is defined in the Architecture for IP Flow 
    Information Export [RFC5470] and related IPFIX documents.

    What is the cost of enabling the IP Flow Monitoring and export to a 
    collector is a basic question that this document tries to answer.

    This document goal is a series of methodology specifications for the
    monitoring of Flow Monitoring performance, in a way that is 
    comparable amongst various implementations, various platforms, and 
    vendors.

    The most impacting parameter in terms of performance is the rate at
    which IP flows are created and expired in the devices memory and
    exported to a collector.  Therefore, this document focuses on a
    methodology on how to measure the maximum IP flow rate that a 
    network device can sustain without impacting the forwarding plane,
    without losing any IP flow information, and without compromising the
    IP flow accuracy. 

    Since Flow Monitoring will in most cases run on network devices 
    forwarding packets, methodology for RFC2544 measurements in the 
    presence of Flow Monitoring is also proposed here. 
   
    [RFC2544], [RFC5180] and [MPLS] specify benchmarking of network
    devices forwarding IPv4, IPv6 and MPLS [RFC3031] traffic,
    respectively. This draft document also proposes the methodology of 
    performing this kind of benchmarking in the presence of Flow 
    Monitoring, but not necessarily restricted to IPv4, IPv6 and MPLS
    traffic types. The methodology stays the same for any traffic, the 
    only restriction being what the actual Flow Monitoring
    implementation supports.

    The impact of Flow Monitoring on the network devices central
    processor unit utilisation is out of scope of this document to avoid 
    white box testing even though it represents an interesting
    performance metric for the comparison of different measurement 
    profiles.

3.  Flow Monitoring Performance Metric 

3.1 The Definition

   Flow Monitoring Throughput

   Definition:
      The maximum Flow Expiration Rate the DUT can sustain without
      losing any information about any offered Flow while exporting
      the Flow Record information to an external collecting device 
      (Collector) and as measured at the Collector.

      The measured Flow Expiration Rate MUST include the Control
      Information.

   Measurement units:
      Number of Flow Records per second

3.2 The Applicability

   The Flow Monitoring Performance Metric is applicable to network
   devices which implement the RFC 5470 [RFC5470] architecture. These 
   devices can be network packet forwarding devices or appliances which
   analyse the traffic but do not forward traffic (probes, sniffers,
   replicators).

   The Flow Monitoring Performance Metric is not applicable to the
   Collector since it does not implement the RFC 5470 architecture and
   the factors influencing performance can be quite different.

   Traffic in the Figure 1 represents the test traffic sent to the DUT
   and forwarded by the DUT

   The Flow Monitoring enabled (see section 4.3) on the DUT uses the
   Flow Keys to create the Flow Records representing the live traffic
   forwarded by the DUT. The Flow Records are stored in the Flow 
   Monitoring Cache and expired from there depending on the Cache
   configuration (mainly timeouts, number of Flow Records and the Cache 
   size) and the traffic pattern (if the Flow Keys in the traffic change

   or not). If Flow Export is configured then Flow Records are exported
   from the DUT to the Collector (see Figure 2 and Figure 3 in section
   4).

3.4 Set-up Examples

3.4.1 Set-up Example 1 - Active Timeout Flow Expiration

   The traffic generator sends 1000 packets per second in 100 streams,
   each stream defined by an unique destination IP address, each stream
   has then packet rate 10 packets per second. The packets are sent in a 
   round robin fashion while incrementing the destination IP address.

   The configured Cache size is 1000 Flow Records so that Flow
   Expiration does not happen due to the Cache overflow. The configured
   Active Timeout is 100 seconds, the Inactive Timeout is 10 seconds.

   Flow Monitoring on the DUT uses as Flow Key the destination IP 
   address. After first 100 packets sent, 100 Flow Records are created 
   and placed in the Flow Monitoring Cache. The consequent packets will 
   be counted against the already created Flow Records since the
   destination IP address (Flow Key) has already been seen by the DUT 
   (provided the Flow Record did not expire yet - see below).

   A packet with destination IP address equal to A is sent every 0.1
   second, so it means that the Flow Record is refreshed in the Cache
   every 0.1 second, while the Inactive Timeout is 10 seconds. In this
   case the Flow Records will not expire from the Cache until the Active
   Timeout, e.g. they will expire every 100 seconds and then the Flow
   Records will be created again.

   If the test measurement time is 50 seconds from the start of the
   traffic generator the measured Flow Expiration Rate is 0 since during
   this period no Flow Records expired from the Cache.

   If the test measurement time is 100 seconds from the start of the
   traffic generator measured Flow Expiration Rate is 1 Flow Record per 
   second.

   If the test measurement time is 300 seconds from the start of the
   traffic generator measured Flow Expiration Rate is 2/3 of Flow Record
   per second since during the 300 seconds period we expired 2 times the
   same 100 of Flows.

   This set-up is not suitable for any benchmarking since the Flow
   Expiration happens only at discrete time points and the measured Flow
   Expiration Rate will depend on how many of those time points were
   captured within the measurement period.

3.4.2 Set-up Example 2 - Inactive Timeout Flow Expiration

   The traffic generator sends 1000 packets per second in 10000 streams,
   each stream defined by an unique destination IP address, each stream
   has then packet rate 0.1 packets per second. The packets are sent in
   a round robin fashion while incrementing the destination IP address.

   The configured Cache size is 20000 Flow Records so that Flow
   Expiration does not happen due to the Cache overflow. The configured 
   Active Timeout is 100 seconds, the Inactive Timeout is 5 seconds.

   Flow Monitoring on the DUT uses as Flow Key the destination IP
   address. After first 100 packets sent, 100 Flow Records are created 
   and placed in the Flow Monitoring Cache. 

   A packet with destination IP address equal to A is sent every 10
   seconds, so it means that the Flow Record is refreshed in the Cache
   every 10 seconds, while the Inactive Timeout is 5 seconds. In this
   case the Flow Records will expire from the Cache due to the Inactive
   Timeout and when a new packet is sent with the same IP address A it
   will create a new Flow Record in the Cache.

   The measured Flow Expiration Rate in this case will be 1000 Flow 
   Records per second since each and single sent packet will always
   create a new Flow Record.

   This setup can be used for benchmarking since the measured Flow 
   Expiration Rate does not depend on the measurement period supposing 
   the measurement period is longer than the Inactive Timeout. If the
   measurement period is smaller or equal to the Inactive Timeout the
   measured Flow Expiration Rate will be zero.

3.4.3 Set-up Example 3 - Cache Overflow Flow Expiration

   The traffic generator sends 10000 packets per second in 10000 
   streams, each stream defined by an unique destination IP address,
   each stream has then packet rate 1 packets per second. The packets
   are sent in a round robin fashion while incrementing the destination
   IP address.

   Flow Monitoring on the DUT uses as Flow Key the destination IP
   address. 

   The configured Cache size is 1000 Flow Records so the Cache overflows
   after first 1000 packets sent (provided the Flow Records do not
   expire due to timeouts - see below). The configured Active Timeout is
   100 seconds, the Inactive Timeout is 10 seconds.

   The Cache will be full after the traffic generator sends first 1000 
   packets which will happen in 0.1 second so the Flow Records can never 
   expire from the Cache due to any of Active or Inactive Timeouts. Each
   packet sent after this initial period of 0.1 second will create one
   new Flow Record and cause another Flow Record to expire from the

   Cache.
 
   The measured Flow Expiration Rate in this case will be 10000 Flow 
   Records per second since each and single sent packet will always
   create a new Flow Record and cause expiration of another Flow Record.

   To perform this kind of measurement the Active and Inactive Timeouts
   must always be larger than the time needed to fill up the Cache.

   This setup can be used for benchmarking since the measured Flow
   Expiration Rate does not depend on the measurement period supposing
   the measurement period is longer than amount of time needed to fill
   up the Cache. Otherwise the measured Flow Expiration Rate will be
   zero.

4. Test Set Up

4.1 Test Topology

   The test set-up is identical to the one used by [RFC2544], with just
   an addition of a Collector to analyse the Flow Export:

   The ideal way to implement the test is using one traffic generator
   (device providing the sender and receiver capabilities) with 
   a sending port and a receiving port. This allows for an easy check
   if all the traffic sent by the sender was transmitted by the DUT and 
   received at the receiver.

   If the effects of enabling Flow Monitoring on several interfaces are
   of concern or the media maximum speed is less that the DUT
   throughput, the topology can be expanded with several input and 
   output ports.

   The traffic forwarding interfaces are only those between the DUT and
   sender and between the DUT and the receiver. The interface towards
   the Collector MUST NOT be used for the test traffic forwarding but 
   only for the Flow Export traffic.

4.2 Base DUT Set Up

   The base DUT set up and the way the set-up is reported in the test
   results is fully specified in Section 7 of [RFC2544].

   The base DUT configuration might include other features like packet
   filters or quality of service on the input and/or output interfaces
   if there is the need to study Flow Monitoring in the presence of
   those features. The Flow Monitoring measurement procedures do not 
   change in this case. Consideration needs to be made when evaluating
   measurements results to take into account the possible change of
   packets rates offered to the DUT and Flow Monitoring after 
   application of the features to the configuration.

Internet-Draft        Flow Monitoring Benchmarking          July 2009

4.3 Flow Monitoring Configuration

   The DUT MUST support Flow Monitoring architecture as specified by 
   [RFC5470]. The DUT SHOULD support IPFIX [RFC5101] for easier results 
   comparison. 

   If the measurements are to be performed with packet sampling the DUT
   MUST support packet sampling as specified in [RFC5476] and related
   documents.

   The DUT configuration and any existing Cache MUST be fully erased
   before application of any new configuration for the currently 
   executed test.
   
   4.3.1 Observation Points

      The DUT Observation Points configuration needs to be decided upon 
      depending on the interest and scope of the testing as follows:

         a. ingress port/ports only
         b. egress port/ports only
         c. both ingress and egress

      Generally, the placement of Observation Points depends upon the
      position of the DUT in the deployed network and the purpose of
      Flow Monitoring deployment. See [RFC3917] for detailed discussion.
      The testing procedures are otherwise the same for all these
      possible configurations.
   
      To measure input and output simultaneously on one DUT port the
      topology in the Figure 2 can be used if the traffic sender and 
      receiver allows for full duplex operation on one port. The only
      change is in the configurations of the sender and receiver.

      If the traffic generator does not allow for full duplex operation, 
      then the topology in Figure 3 needs to be used with separate 
      sending and receiving ports in both directions.

   4.3.2 Metering Process

      Metering Process MUST be enabled in order to create the Cache in
      the DUT and configure the Cache related parameters.

      Cache Size available to the DUT operation MUST be known and taken 
      into account when designing the test as specified in the section
      5.

      Inactive and Active Timeouts MUST be known and taken into account
      when designing the test as specified in the section 5.

Internet-Draft        Flow Monitoring Benchmarking          July 2009

   4.3.3 Exporting Process

      Exporting Process MUST be configured in such a way that all Flow
      Record information from all configured Observation Points is
      exported. This makes sure that Flow Expiration Rate as measured
      from the Collector data includes all the Flow information handled 
      by the DUT at the time of

      the measurement. The measurement time to be used to capture Flow
      Export data and to calculate Flow Expiration Rate is defined in 
      sections 5.1 and 5.2.

      Various Flow Monitoring implementations might use different 
      default values regarding the export of Control Information. The 
      Flow Export corresponding to Control Information SHOULD be 
      analysed and reported as a separate item on the test report. 

      IPFIX documents [RFC5101] in section 10 and [RFC5470] in section 
      8.1 discuss the possibility to deploy various transport layer
      protocols to deliver Flow Export data from the DUT to the
      Collector. The chosen protocol SHOULD be included in the test
      report. Only measurements with same transport layer protocol MUST 
      be compared.

   4.3.4 Flow Records

      The Flow Record definition is very implementation specific. A Flow
      Monitoring implementation might allow only for fixed Flow Record
      definition, based on the most common IP parameters in the IPv4 or
      IPv6 headers - like source and destination IP addresses, IP
      protocol numbers or transport level port numbers. Another
      implementation might allow the user to actually define his own
      completely arbitrary Flow Record to monitor the traffic. The
      requirement for the tests defined in this document is only the
      need for a large number of Flow Records in the Cache. The Flow
      Keys needed to achieve that will typically be source and 
      destinations IP addresses and transport level port numbers.

      Recommended full Flow Record:
         Flow Key fields
                Source IP address
                Destination IP address
                Transport layer source port
                Transport layer destination port
                IP protocol
                IP Type of Service or IP flow label

        Other fields
                Packet counter
                Byte counter 

      If the Flow Monitoring allows for user defined Flow Records the 
      minimal Flow Record configurations allowing to achieve large

      numbers of Cache entries for example are:  
  
        Flow Key fields
                Source IP address
                Destination IP address
               
        Other fields 
                Packet counter



      or:

         Flow Key fields
                Transport layer source port
                Transport layer destination port

         Other fields 
                Packet counter

4.3.5 MPLS Test Specifics

    The Flow Record configuration for measurements with MPLS
    encapsulated traffic SHOULD contain MPLS label or any field which is
    part of the MPLS header. 

    The DUT Cache SHOULD be checked prior the performance test to
    contain the correct MPLS related information.

    The captured export data at the Collector SHOULD be checked for the
    presence of MPLS labels or the monitored MPLS parameters.
       
    MPLS forwarding performance document [MPLS] specifies number of
    possible MPLS label operations to test. The Observation Points
    SHOULD be placed on all the DUT interfaces where the particular MPLS 
    label operation takes place.

    The performance tests SHOULD be performed with only one MPLS label
    operation at the time.

    The DUT SHOULD be configured in such a way, that all the traffic is
    subject of the tested MPLS label operation.
    
4.4 Collector
 
   The Collector SHOULD support IPFIX [RFC5101] for easier results 
   analysis. If proprietary Flow Export is deployed, the Collector MUST 
   support it. 

   The Collector MUST be capable to capture at the full rate the export
   packets sent from the DUT without losing any of them. It does not 
   have to have any Flow Export decoding capabilities itself, just needs

   to provide the captured data in the hexadecimal format for an off-
   line analysis which can be done after each performed measurement.
   During the analysis the Flow Export data need to be decoded and the
   received Flow Records counted. 

   The Collector SHOULD support Ethernet type of interface to connect to
   the DUT but any media which allow data capturing and analysis can be
   used.

   The capture buffer MUST be cleared at the beginning of each
   measurement.

4.5 Packet Sampling

   A Flow Monitoring implementation might provide the capability to
   analyse the Flows after packet sampling is performed. The possible 
   procedures and ways of packet sampling are described in [RFC5476]
   and [RFC5475] and only those SHOULD be used for measurements.

   If the DUT is configured with one of the sampling techniques as
   specified in [RFC5475] the test report MUST include the sampling
   technique along with its parameters. The Collector MUST support the
   deployed techniques.

   The configured packet sampling technique on the DUT and its
   parameters SHOULD be verified in the Flow Export data as received on 
   the Collector.

   Packet sampling will affect the measured Flow Expiration Rate. If 
   systematic sampling (see section 6.5 of [RFC5476]) is in use, the 
   Flow Expiration Rate can be derived from the packet rates (see
   section 5 of this document) using the configured sampling parameters.
   If random  sampling is in use the Flow Expiration Rate can be derived 
   from the traffic rates as obtained on the receiver side of the
   traffic generator, provided that packet loses can be excluded by 
   monitoring the DUT statistics.

   If tests are performed with Flows containing more than one packet
   (see section 6.2 of this document) the sampling ratio SHOULD always
   be higher than the number of packets in the Flows (for small number
   of packets). This decreases the probability of erasing a whole Flow
   to a minimum and the measured Flow Expiration rates stay unaffected
   by sampling. 

   If Flow accuracy analysis is performed the results will be always
   affected by packet sampling and the complete check of data cannot be
   performed (see section 7).

   This document does not intend to study the effects of packet sampling
   itself on the network devices but packet sampling can simply be
   applied as part of the Flow Monitoring configuration on the DUT and 
   perform the measurements as specified in the later sections. 
   Consideration needs to be made when evaluating measurements results

   to take into account the change of packet rates offered to the DUT
   and especially to Flow Monitoring after packet sampling is applied.

4.6 Frame Formats

   Flow Monitoring itself is not dependent in any way on the media used
   on the input and output ports, any media can be used as supported by
   the DUT and the test equipment.

   The most common media and frame formats for IPv4, IPv6 and MPLS
   traffic are specified within [RFC2544], [RFC5180] and [MPLS].

4.7 Frame Sizes

   Frame sizes to use are specified in [RFC2544] section 9 for Ethernet
   type interfaces (64, 128, 256, 1024, 1280, 1518 bytes) and in


   [RFC5180] section 5 for Packet over Sonet interfaces (47, 64, 128,
   256, 1024, 1280, 1518, 2048, 4096 bytes).

4.8 DUT Load

   The Flow Monitoring Throughput SHOULD be measured under different
   levels of traffic load through the DUT. The traffic creating the load
   MUST be designed in such a way that it represents only one Flow
   Record in the DUT Cache. The variance in Flow Monitoring Throughput 
   as function of the traffic load should be noted for comparison 
   purposes between two DUTs of similar architecture and capability.

5. Flow Monitoring Throughput Measurement Methodology

   Objective: 

      To define and measure metric fully expressing the Flow
      Monitoring performance which can be used to compare different
      implementations.

   Metric definition: 

      Flow Monitoring Throughput - see section 3.

   Flow Expiration Rate calculation:

      The Flow Expiration Rate is obtained from the data captured at the 
      Collector (section 4.4) as the number of Flows seen divided by the 
      measurement time as specified in the section 5.1 and 5.2
  
   The Flow Expiration Rate the DUT can achieve without losing any Flow
   information depends on the combination of a number of Flow Monitoring
   parameters and traffic patterns offered to the DUT. This makes it
   a complex task to define and measure a single metric which would
   characterise the Flow Monitoring performance. There are two Flow

Internet-Draft        Flow Monitoring Benchmarking          July 2009

   Monitoring operational modes which need to be distinguished and
   measured separately while using the same metric.

5.1 Normal Cache Mode

   In the normal cache mode the DUT MUST hold less Flow Records in the
   Cache than the available Cache Size during the whole test.

   Test Feasibility: 

      The DUT Cache status MUST be monitored during this test. If the
      number of Flow Records starts to grow during the test and approach 
      the Cache Size testing MUST be stopped. The reported Flow
      Monitoring Throughput for normal cache mode is the highest
      possible Flow Expiration Rate at which the number of Flow Records 
      in the Cache stays constant or marginally increases during the 
      measurement.

   The reason for this test mode is, that the Flow Monitoring
   implementation might choose to use different Flow Expiration 
   mechanism as opposed to the test mode specified in section 5.2 and 
   the results for the two modes can be quite different.

5.1.1 Flow Monitoring Configuration Parameters 

   Cache Size: 
      Maximum available value on the network device

   Inactive Timeout
      Minimum possible value on the network device

   Active Timeout 
      Higher or equal value to the Inactive Timeout

   Flow Keys Definition:
      Needs to allow for large numbers of unique Flow Records to be
      created in the Cache by incrementing values of one or several Flow
      Keys. The number of unique combinations of Flow Keys MUST be 
      larger than the DUT Cache Size or larger than the product of the
      offered packet rate and the Inactive Timeout so that the Flow 
      Records in the Cache never get updated before Flow Expiration and 
      Flow Export.

5.1.2 Traffic Configuration Parameters

   Traffic Generation
      The traffic generator (sender) when sending the packets needs to
      increment the packet header values defined as Flow Keys values in
      the Flow Record with each sent packet. Each packet then represents
      one Flow Record in the DUT Cache and the packet rate equals to the 
      Flow Expiration Rate.

Internet-Draft        Flow Monitoring Benchmarking          July 2009

   Maximum Packet Rate
      The maximum packet rate which can be used for the normal cache
      mode measurement is the Cache Size divided by the Inactive
      Timeout. If the Flow Monitoring implementation allows to configure 
      Inactive Timeout 0 then any packet rate is possible to be used. 
      This makes sure the Flow Records expire and get exported from the
      Cache before it becomes full.

   Test Duration

      The test duration MUST be longer than Inactive Timeout.

5.1.3 Measurement Time
  
      The measurement time to be used to calculate Flow Expiration Rate
      is equal to the time interval when traffic is offered to the DUT.
      The Collector MUST continue capturing export data at least for the 
      Inactive Timeout period after the traffic generation is stopped.
      This makes sure that all the Flow Records created in the DUT Cache
      will be exported and analysed.

5.1.4 Procedure

   The measurement procedure is same as the Throughput measurement in
   the section 26.1 of [RFC2544] for the traffic sending side.
   The output analysis is not done on the DUT receiving side but the
   analysed quantity for the measurement of the maximum rate value is
   the Flow Record count as provided by the Flow Export data captured at 
   the Collector as specified in the section 4.4.

   If the maximum packet rate (as specified in the section 4.1.2) does
   not cause the DUT to drop any Flow Record then the reported Flow 
   Monitoring Throughput SHOULD be equal to the maximum packet rate. The
   limitation here is that the configurable values of Cache Size and
   Inactive Timeout do not allow to test with higher Flow Expiration
   Rates in normal Cache mode. 

5.2 Cache Overflow Mode

   In the cache overflow mode the DUT MUST have the Cache fully 
   occupied by Flow Records at any time during the measurement.

5.2.1 Flow Monitoring Configuration Parameters 

   Cache Size
      Cache Size should be configured to a moderate size accordingly to
      the expected DUT position in the network. Its value may be
      limited by the fact that the number of unique Flow Keys sets
      which the traffic generator (sender) can provide should be
      multiple times larger than the Cache Size to make sure that the
      Flow Records in the Cache never get updated before Flow Expiration
      and Flow Export.

Internet-Draft        Flow Monitoring Benchmarking          July 2009
      Example Cache Sizes:
         Small office device  - 5 to 10 000 entries
         Medium access device - 50 to 100 000 entries
         Backbone device      - 500 000 and higher

   Inactive Timeout
      Maximum possible value on the network device. The value has to be
      larger than the Cache Size divided by the test packet rate offered 
      to the DUT to make sure the Flow Records do not expire from the
      Cache before the number of Flow Records in the Cache reaches the
      Cache Size.

   Active Timeout 
      Higher or equal value to the Inactive Timeout

   Flow Keys Definition:
      Needs to allow for large numbers of unique Flow Records to be
      created in the Cache by incrementing values of one or several Flow
      Keys. The number of unique combinations of Flow Keys values SHOULD 
      be at least two times larger than the DUT Cache Size. This makes 
      sure that any incoming packet will never refresh any already
      existing Flow Record in the Cache and will cause another Flow 
      Record to expire from the Cache. This is sometimes called
      emergency Flow Expiration as opposed to the inactive or active
      timeout of a Flow Record.

5.2.2 Traffic Configuration Parameters

   Traffic Generation
      The traffic generator needs to increment the Flow Keys values with
      each sent packet, this way each packet represents one Flow in the
      DUT Cache and the packet rate equals to the Flow Expiration Rate.

   Test Duration
      The test duration MUST be longer than the time needed to fully
      fill up the Cache with Flow Records.

5.2.3 Measurement Time
  
   The measurement time to be used to calculate Flow Expiration Rate
   equal to the time interval when traffic is offered to the DUT minus 
   the time needed to fully fill the Cache calculated as Cache Size 
   divided by the test traffic packet rate during the measurement. The 
   Collector MUST stop capturing export data immediately when the 
   traffic generation is stopped. This makes sure that the Flow Records 
   exported later from the fully occupied Cache do not poison the
   measured Flow Monitoring Throughput.

5.2.4 Procedure

   The measurement procedure is same as the Throughput measurement in
   the section 26.1 of [RFC2544] for the traffic sending side.
   The output analysis is not done on the DUT receiving side but the

   analysed quantity for the measurement of the maximum rate value is
   the Flow Record count as derived from the Flow Export data captured
   at the Collector as specified in the section 4.4.

6. RFC2544 Measurements

   Objective: 

      Provide RFC2544 network device characteristics in the presence of
      Flow Monitoring on the DUT. The RFC2544 studies numerous 
      characteristics of network devices. The purely forwarding 
      characteristics without Flow Monitoring present on the DUT can
      significantly vary when Flow Monitoring starts to be deployed on
      the network device. The objective of the section is to a define
      controlled environment for Flow Monitoring during all the tests
      with all the parameters as specified below included in the test
      report.

   Metric definition:
  
     Metric as specified in [RFC2544] 

6.1 Flow Monitoring Configuration

   Flow Monitoring Configuration (as detailed in the section 4.3) needs
   to be applied the same way as discussed in the section 5 depending on 
   the desired Cache test mode.
 
   RFC2544 measurements which do not involve Throughput measurement can
   be set to be measured with fixed Flow Expiration Rate or at the
   value corresponding to the Flow Monitoring Throughput.

   RFC2544 Throughput measurement with Flow Monitoring enabled
   represents two dimensional measurement and it depends on the DUT
   capabilities and the test set-up if the maximum of both variables can
   be found at the same time as specified below.  

6.2 Single Traffic Component

   Section 12 of [RFC2544] discusses the use of protocol source and
   destination addresses for defined tests. To perform all the RFC2544 
   type measurements with Flow Monitoring enabled the defined Flow Keys
   SHOULD contain IP source and destination address. The RFC2544 type
   measurements can be executed under these additional conditions:

      a. the test traffic does not use just single unique pair of source 
         and destination address
        
      b. the traffic generator defines test traffic as follows
            
         1) define the test exactly as specified in the section 5.1 or 
            5.2


Novak                                         Expires January 1, 2010 
                               [Page 20]
Internet-Draft        Flow Monitoring Benchmarking          July 2009

         2) allow for a parameter to say send N (where N is an integer 
            number starting at 1 and incremented in small steps) packets
            with IP addresses A and B before changing both IP addresses 
            to the next value

    This test traffic definition allows execution of the above defined
    IP Flow Monitoring tests with one defined Flow Expiration Rate while 
    measuring the DUT RFC2544 characteristics. This set-up is the better
    option since it best simulates the live network traffic scenario 
    with Flows containing more than just one packet.

    The initial packet rate at N equal to 1 defines the Flow Expiration
    Rate for the whole measurement procedure. The consequent increases
    of N do not change it, the time and Cache characteristics of the
    test traffic stay the same. The initial rate needs to be small 
    enough to allow for the test traffic rates granular enough while 
    allowing large enough value of Flow Expiration Rate for the
    measurement. The best procedure is to measure Flow Monitoring 
    Throughput and RFC2544 Throughput independently first and then 
    design the rates for the mutual test.

6.3 Two Traffic Components

   The test traffic set-up in the section 6.2 might be difficult to 
   achieve with commercial traffic generators. The way around it is to 
   define two traffic components in the test traffic - one to populate 
   Flow Monitoring Cache and the second one to execute the RFC2544 
   tests.

   Flow Monitoring Test Traffic Component - the exact traffic definition 
   as specified in the sections 5.1 and 5.2.

   RFC2544 Test Traffic Component - test traffic as specified by 
   [RFC2544] but under the condition it MUST create just one Flow Record 
   in the DUT Cache. In the particular set-up discussed here this would 
   mean a traffic stream with just one pair of unique source and 
   destination IP addresses (but could be avoided if Flow Keys were for   
   example UDP/TCP source and destination ports and Flow Keys did not
   contain the addresses).

   The first traffic component will exercise the DUT in terms of 
   Flow activity while the second traffic component will measure the
   RFC2544 characteristics. The traffic rates to be reported as
   Throughput are the sum of rates of both components. The RFC2544
   metrics do not need any change.

7. Flow Monitoring Accuracy

   The pure Flow Monitoring tests in section 5 provide the capability to
   verify the Flow Monitoring accuracy in terms of the exported Flow
   Record data. Since every Flow Record created in the Cache is 
   populated by just one packet, the full set of captured data on the
   Collector can be parsed (e.g. providing the exported Flow Record

Internet-Draft        Flow Monitoring Benchmarking          July 2009
   
   contents not only the Flow Record count) and each set of parameters 
   from each Flow Record can be checked against the parameters as
   configured on the traffic generator and set in packets sent to the
   DUT. The exported Flow Record is considered accurate if:

      1. all the Flow Record fields are present in each exported Flow
         Record
      2. all the Flow Record fields values match the value ranges
         as set by the traffic generator (for example an IP address 
         falls within the range of the IP addresses increments on the 
         traffic generator)
      3. all the possible Flow Record fields values as defined at the 
         traffic generator have been found in the captured export data
         on the Collector. This check needs to be offset to potential
         detected packet loses during the test

   If Packet Sampling is deployed then only verifications in point 1
   and 2 can be performed.

   This verification can be eased by collecting some Flow Monitoring 
   statistics from the DUT.

8. Evaluating Flow Monitoring Applicability

   The test results as discussed in this document and obtained for
   certain DUTs allow for a preliminary analysis of a Flow Monitoring
   deployment based on Internet traffic analysis data provided by
   organisations like [CAIDA] or performed on the network in question.
   The data needed to make an estimate if a certain network device
   can manage the particular amount of live traffic with Flow Monitoring
   enabled is:

   Average packet size:            350 bytes
   Number of packets per IP Flow:  20

   Expected data rate on the network device: 1 Gbit/s

   This results in:

   Expected packet rate: 357 000 pps  

      being (1 Gbit/s divided by 350 bytes/packet)

   Flows per second: 18 000

      being (packet rate 357 000 pps divided by 20 packets per IP Flow)

   Under constant load with the parameters above the network device will
   always run in the Cache Overflow mode (if the network is large enough 
   the Flows will hardly ever repeat within the few seconds needed to
   fill up lets say 300 000 entries Cache (if the Flow Keys contain
   parameters like IP addresses or transport level protocols and ports).

   It needs to be kept in mind that the above is a very rough Flow 
   activity estimate which cannot account for traffic anomalies like
   large number of for example DNS request packets which are typically
   small packets coming from many different sources and represent always
   just one packet Flow.

10. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA considerations.

11. Security Considerations

   Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
   the Internet or corporate networks as long as benchmarking
   is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating
   networks.

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
   environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints
   specified in the sections above.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT.

   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT specifically for
   benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network security arising
   from the DUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production
   networks.
