Internet-Draft             ISATAP DHCP Option              November 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol option
   [RFC2131][RFC2132] for the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing
   Protocol (ISATAP) [RFC5214].  The option encodes configuration
   information used by clients to initialize the Potential Router List
   (PRL) as specified in [RFC5214], section 8.3.2.  The option format is
   similar to [RFC3361] and supports publishing of an IPv4 anycast
   address followed by a list of IPv4 addresses and/or domain names that
   form the PRL for the ISATAP link.


2.  Terminology and Requirements

   The terminology of ISATAP [RFC5214] applies to this document.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  ISATAP DHCPv4 Option

   The ISATAP DHCPv4 option encodes an ISATAP IPv4 Anycast address
   followed by a list of 'M' 4-octet IPv4 addresses followed by a list
   of 'N' DNS [RFC1035] fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs).  The
   ISATAP DHCPv4 option encodes a sequence of octets using the following
   format:

      Code  Len   M    N    Any  <- IPv4 addr's ->   <-   FQDN's    ->
     +----+----+----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
     | TBD| Len|  M |  N  | Any| a1 | a2 | ...| aM | f1 | f2 | ...| fN |
     +----+----+----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

                                 Figure 1

   In this format, the DHCPv4 option code is followed immediately by a
   'Len' octet that indicates the total number of octets that follow
   within this DHCPv4 option field.  The rest of the DHCPv4 option is
   encoded as follows:

   o  the 'Len' octet is followed immediately by an 'M' octet that
      indicates the total number of IPv4 addresses that follow the IPv4
      Anycast address,

   o  the 'M' octet is followed immediately by an 'N' octet that
      indicates the total number of FQDNs that follow the list of IPv4
      addresses,

Internet-Draft             ISATAP DHCP Option              November 2009


   o  the 'N' octet is followed by a 4-octet IPv4 Anycast address,

   o  the IPv4 Anycast address is followed by a list of 'M' 4-octet IPv4
      addresses,

   o  the list of IPv4 addresses if followed by a list of 'N' DNS FQDN's
      encoded exactly as specified in Section 3.1 of [RFC1035].  (Note:
      this is the same format specified in Section 3.1 of [RFC1035]).

   For example, if the server wants to advertise the IPv4 anycast
   address '192.0.2.1', followed by the IPv4 addresses '192.0.2.3' and
   '192.0.2.3', followed by the FQDNs "isatap.com", "isatap.org" and
   "isatap.net", the DHCPv4 option would be encoded as follows (where
   numeric values are represented as decimal):

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |TBD| 51| 2 | 3 |192| 00| 02| 01|192| 00| 02| 02|192| 00| 02|
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | 03| 0 | 6 |'i'|'s'|'a'|'t'|'a'|'p'| 3 |'c'|'o'|'m'| 0 | 6 |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |'i'|'s'|'a'|'t'|'a'|'p'| 3 |'o'|'r'|'g'| 0 | 6 |'i'|'s'|'a'|
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |'t'|'a'|'p'| 3 |'n'|'e'|'t'| 0 |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                                 Figure 2

   ISATAP clients MAY use the elements encoded in the ISATAP DHCPv4
   option to initialize the PRL as specified in Section 8.3.2 of
   [RFC5214].  Legacy ISATAP clients may instead silently ignore this
   option and continue to use their pre-existing PRL initialization
   methods, i.e., backward compatibility is preserved.

   Note: when no IPv4 anycast address is to be used for this ISATAP
   link, the IPv4 Anycast address is encoded as four zero octets (i.e.,
   to represent the value '0.0.0.0').  When a non-zero IPv4 anycast
   address is included, ISATAP clients MAY use this address as the IPv4
   destination address of ip-proto-41 packets that were forwarded into
   the ISATAP interface via an IPv6 default route.  ISATAP routers do
   not use the IPv4 anycast address as the source address for
   ip-proto-41 packets; they use their IPv4 unicast address that is
   listed in the ISATAP PRL instead.  This implies that each ISATAP
   router MUST configure both the IPv4 Anycast address (when the anycast
   address is non-zero) and an IPv4 unicast address that is added to the
   PRL.

   When the length of the ISATAP DHCPv4 Option exceeds 254 octets, the
   option is encoded as for DHCP long options as specified in [RFC3396].

Internet-Draft             ISATAP DHCP Option              November 2009


   ISATAP routers and clients use the unicast IPv4 address in the PRL
   (i.e., and not the ISATAP IPv4 anycast address) for IPv6 neighbor
   discovery operations the same as specified in Section 8 of [RFC5214].


4.  IANA Considerations

   A new DHCPv4 option number for ISATAP is requested.


5.  Related Work

   The ISATAP DHCP option was published in
   'draft-templin-isatap-dhcp-00.tx' in February 2003.  The use of IPv4
   Anycast with ISATAP was published in
   'draft-ietf-ngrtans-isatap-00.txt' in March 2001.

   'draft-ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd' presents a similar DHCP option that
   advertises a 6RD prefix and an IPv4 anycast address.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC2131] apply.
