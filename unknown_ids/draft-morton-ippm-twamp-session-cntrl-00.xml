      <t>The IETF is completing its work on TWAMP - the Two-Way Active
      Measurement Protocol. This memo describes a proposed feature for TWAMP,
      intended for discussion in the IP Performance Metrics WG. The feature
      gives the sender the ability to start and stop one or more test sessions
      using the Session Identifiers.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IETF is completing its work on TWAMP - the Two-Way Active
      Measurement Protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>, which
      is an extension to the One-way Active Measurement Protocol, OWAMP <xref
      target="RFC4656"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This memo describes a new proposed feature for TWAMP, so it can be
      discussed and interest to take-up the feature assessed. TWAMP (and
      OWAMP) start all previously requested and accepted test sessions at
      once. This feature allows the Control-Client to control the test
      sessions on the basis of their Session Identifier (SID). The feature
      permits a short duration TWAMP test to start (and stop) during a longer
      test. For example, this feature permits a specific diagnostic test to
      begin if intermediate results indicate that the test is warranted.</t>

      <t>This feature requires a Mode bit position assignment and the
      assignment of two new TWAMP command numbers (for the augmented Start and
      Stop commands).</t>

      <t>The relationship between this memo and TWAMP is intended to be an
      update to the TWAMP RFC when published.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Purpose and Scope">
      <t>The purpose of this memo is to describe an additional function and
      feature for TWAMP <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>. The
      feature needs a clear description so it can be discussed and (hopefully)
      adopted in the IP Performance Metrics Charter.</t>

      <t>The scope of the memo is currently limited to specifications of the
      following features:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Extension of the modes of operation through assignment of a new
          value in the Mode field to communicate feature capability and use,
          the definition of augmented Start Session and Stop Session commands,
          and the definition of related procedures for TWAMP entities. The
          motivation for this added feature is the ability to start and stop
          individual test sessions at will, using a single TWAMP-control
          connection.</t>
        </list>When new features are discussed and reach consensus, they may
      become chartered work items in IETF IPPM (and may appear in a different
      memo).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="TWAMP Control Extensions">
      <t>TWAMP-Control protocol is a derivative of the OWAMP-Control protocol,
      and provides two-way measurement capability. TWAMP <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref> uses the Mode field to identify and
      select specific communication capabilities, and this field is a
      recognized extension mechanism. The following sections describe one such
      extension.</t>

      <section title="Connection Setup with Individual Session Control">
        <t>TWAMP connection establishment follows the procedure defined in
        section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC4656"></xref>. The Individual Session
        Control mode requires one new bit position (and value) to identify the
        ability of the Server/Session-Reflector to start and stop specific
        sessions (according to their Session Identifier, or SID). This new
        feature requires an additional TWAMP mode bit assignment as
        follows:</t>

        <t>In the original OWAMP mode field, setting bit positions 0, 1 or 2
        indicated the security mode of the Control protocol, and the Test
        protocol inherited the same mode (see section 4 of <xref
        target="RFC4656"></xref>). In the <xref
        target="I-D.morton-ippm-more-twamp"></xref> proposal, bit positions
        (3, 4 or 5) discontinue the inheritance of the security mode in the
        Test protocol.</t>

        <t>The Server sets the new bit position (possibly bit 8) in the Server
        Greeting message to indicate its capabilities and willingness to
        control sessions on an individual basis if desired.</t>

        <t>If the Control-Client intends to control sessions on an individual
        basis, it MUST set the mode bit corresponding to that mode in the
        Setup Response message.</t>

      <section title="Start-Sessions Command with Session Control">
        <t>Having requested one or more test sessions and received affirmative
        Accept-Session responses, an OWAMP client MAY start the execution of
        the requested test sessions by sending a Start-Sessions message to the

        <t>The Number of sessions field indicates the count of sessions that
        this Start command applies to. The SID is as defined in OWAMP (and
        TWAMP) section 3.5 <xref target="RFC4656"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The Server MUST respond with a Start-Ack message (which SHOULD be
        sent as quickly as possible). Start-Ack messages have the format
        defined in section 3.7 of <xref target="RFC4656"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The Control Client MUST NOT send a subsequent Start Sessions
        command until an outstanding message is acknowledged with a Start-Ack

        <t>The Number of sessions field indicates the count of sessions that
        this Stop command applies to. The SID is as defined in OWAMP (and
        TWAMP) section 3.5 <xref target="RFC4656"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="SERVWAIT Timer Operation">
        <t>Section 3.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref> describes
        the operation of the optional SERVWAIT timer. In normal TWAMP
        operation, the Server suspends monitoring the SERVWAIT timer while
        test sessions are in progress. When the Individual Session Control
        feature is utilized, this suspension is extended to cover the time
        when ANY test session is in progress. </t>

        <t>Thus, the Server SHALL suspend monitoring control connection
        activity after receiving any Start-Sessions command, and SHALL resume
        after receiving a Stop-Sessions command for all corresponding SIDs
        (and no test sessions are in-progress).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Additional considerations">
        <t>The value of the Modes field sent by the Server (in the Server
        Greeting message) is the bit-wise OR of the mode values that it is
        willing to support during this session.</t>

        <t>If this feature is adopted, the last seven bits of the Modes 32-bit
        field are used. The first 25 bits MUST be zero. A client conforming to
        this version of the specification MUST ignore the values in the first
        25 bits of the Modes value. (This way, the bits are available for
        future protocol extensions.)</t>

        <t>Other ways in which TWAMP extends OWAMP are described in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="TWAMP Test with Individual Session Control">
      <t>The TWAMP test protocol is similar to the OWAMP <xref
      target="RFC4656"></xref> test protocol with the exception that the
      Session-Reflector transmits test packets to the Session-Sender in
      response to each test packet it receives. TWAMP <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref> defines two different test packet
      formats, one for packets transmitted by the Session-Sender and one for
      packets transmitted by the Session-Reflector. As with OWAMP-Test
      protocol there are three security modes: unauthenticated, authenticated,
      and encrypted. Unauthenticated mode has one test packet format, while
      authenticated and encrypted modes use another (common) format.</t>

      <section title="Sender Behavior">
        <t>The individual session control feature requires that the sender
        MUST manage test sessions according to their SID. Otherwise, the
        sender behavior is as describe in section 4.1 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Reflector Behavior">
        <t>The TWAMP Reflector follows the procedures and guidelines in
        section 4.2 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>, with the
        following additional functions required by this feature:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The session reflector MUST manage test sessions according to
            their SID.</t>

            <t>Packets for a specific session/SID not received within the
            Timeout (following the Stop-Session command) MUST be ignored by
            the Reflector. The Session-Reflector MUST NOT generate a test
            packet to the Session-Sender for packets that are ignored.</t>

            <t>If the optional REFWAIT timer is implemented, it SHOULD be
            enforced when any test session is in-progress (started and not
            stopped).</t>
          </list></t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>These extended modes of operation permit stronger integrity
      protection on the TWAMP-Control protocol while simultaneously
      emphasizing accuracy or efficiency on the TWAMP-Test protocol, thus
      enhancing overall security when compared to the previous options.</t>

      <t>The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
      live networks are relevant here as well. See the security considerations
      in<xref target="RFC4656"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This memo requests assignment of one mode bit position/value to the
      IANA registry for the TWAMP Mode field, and describes behavior when the
      new mode is used. This field is a recognized extension mechanism for
      TWAMP.</t>

      <t>This memo also requests assignment of two command numbers in the
      TWAMP-Control Command Number registry, and describes the use of the new
      commands. The command number field is a recognized extension mechanism
      for TWAMP.</t>

      <section title="Registry Specification">
        <t>IANA has created a TWAMP-Modes registry (as requested in <xref
        target="I-D.morton-ippm-more-twamp"></xref>). TWAMP-Modes are
        specified in TWAMP Server Greeting messages and Set-up Response
        messages, as described in section 3.1 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>, consistent with section 3.1 of
        <xref target="RFC4656"></xref>, and extended by this memo. Modes are
        indicated by setting bits in the 32-bit Modes field. Thus, this
        registry can contain a total of 32 possible values.</t>

        <t>IANA has also created a TWAMP-Control Command Number registry.
        TWAMP-Control commands are specified by the first octet in
        TWAMP-Control messages as specified in section 3.5 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref>, and augmented by this memo. This
        registry may contain sixteen possible values.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Registry Management">
        <t>Because the TWAMP-Control Command Number registry can contain only
        sixteen values, TWAMP-Modes can only contain thirty-two values, and
        because TWAMP is an IETF protocol, these registries must be updated
        only by "IETF Consensus" as specified in <xref
        target="RFC2434"></xref>(an RFC documenting registry use that is
        approved by the IESG). Management of these registries is described in
        section 8.2 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp"></xref> and <xref
        target="I-D.morton-ippm-more-twamp"></xref>.</t>

        <t>This memo proposes assignment of values 7 and 8.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Experimental Numbers">
        <t>One experimental value has been assigned in the TWAMP-Control
        Command Number registry.</t>
