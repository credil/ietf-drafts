Internet-Draft             ISATAP DHCP Option              December 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol option
   [RFC2131][RFC2132] for nodes that implement the Intra-Site Automatic
   Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) [RFC5214].  The option encodes
   configuration information used by clients to initialize the Potential
   Router List as specified in [RFC5214], section 8.3.2.  The option
   format is similar to that specified in [RFC3361], and includes a list
   of IPv4 addresses and domain names that form the Potential Router
   List.


2.  Terminology and Requirements

   The terminology of ISATAP [RFC5214] applies to this document.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  ISATAP DHCPv4 Option

   The ISATAP DHCPv4 option encodes a list of IPv4 addresses followed by
   a list of DNS [RFC1035] fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs).  The
   ISATAP DHCPv4 option encodes a sequence of octets using the following
   format:

       Code  Len   M   <- IPv4 addr's ->   <-   FQDN's    ->
      +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
      | TBD| Len|  M | a1 | a2 | ...| aM | f1 | f2 | ...| fN |
      +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

                   Figure 1: ISATAP DHCPv4 Option Format

   As shown in Figure 1, the DHCPv4 option code is followed immediately
   by a 'Len' octet that indicates the total number of option octets
   that follow.  The 'Len' octet is followed by an 'M' octet that
   indicates the total number of IPv4 addresses that follow, and the 'M'
   octet is then followed by a list of 'M' 4-octet IPv4 addresses.  The
   final IPv4 address is followed by a list of 'N' DNS FQDN's encoded
   exactly as specified in Section 3.1 of [RFC1035], where 'N' is
   implicitly derived by parsing the remaining portion of the option
   beyond the final IPv4 address.

   For example, if the administrator wishes to advertise the IPv4
   addresses '192.0.2.3' and '192.0.2.3', and the FQDNs "isatap.com",
   "isatap.org" and "isatap.net", the DHCPv4 option is encoded as shown

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |TBD| 45| 2 |192| 00| 02| 02|192| 00| 02| 03| 6 |'i'|'s'|'a'|
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |'t'|'a'|'p'| 3 |'c'|'o'|'m'| 0 | 6 |'i'|'s'|'a'|'t'|'a'|'p'|
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | 3 |'o'|'r'|'g'| 0 | 6 |'i'|'s'|'a'|'t'|'a'|'p'| 3 |'n'|'e'|
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |'t'| 0 |
      +---+---+

                  Figure 2: ISATAP DHCPv4 Option Example

   ISATAP clients use the information encoded in the ISATAP DHCPv4
   option to initialize the Potential Router List as specified in
   Section 8.3.2 of [RFC5214].  The ISATAP client itself (i.e., and not
   the DHCP server) resolves each FQDN into a list of IPv4 addresses,
   since the name resolution service available to the ISATAP client may
   in some cases be more responsive to dynamic updates than the name
   resolution service available to the DHCP server.

   If the length of the ISATAP DHCPv4 Option exceeds 254 octets, the
   option is encoded as for DHCP long options as specified in [RFC3396].


4.  Anycast Services

   Any of the IPv4 addresses that appear in the Potential Router List
   may be anycast addresses, i.e., they may be configured on the ISATAP
   interfaces of more than one router.  In that case, each ISATAP router
   that configures the same anycast address must provide equivalent
   packet forwarding and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery services.

   ISATAP clients use the minimum path MTU for all routers that
   configure the same anycast address as the MTU for the tunnel
   neighbor.


5.  Backward Compatibility

   The ISATAP DHCP option can be used in the presence of legacy ISATAP
   clients which typically construct a FQDN for the Potential Router
   List by concatenating the string "isatap" with a connection-specific
   DNS suffix "example.com" received from the DHCP server, e.g., as
   "isatap.example.com".  Administrators should therefore ensure that
   the Potential Router Lists discovered by clients that implement the
   ISATAP DHCP option are consistent with the Potential Router Lists

   discovered by legacy clients.


6.  IANA Considerations

   A new DHCPv4 option number for ISATAP is requested.


7.  Related Work

   'draft-ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd' presents a similar DHCP option that
   advertises a 6RD prefix and an IPv4 anycast address.


8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC2131] apply.
