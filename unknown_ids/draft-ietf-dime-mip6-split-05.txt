Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH Support     September 2007


Abstract

   Mobile IPv6 deployments may want to bootstrap their operations
   dynamically based on an interaction between the Home Agent and the
   Diameter server of the Mobile Service Provider (MSP).  This document
   specifies the interaction between a Mobile IP Home Agent and the
   Diameter server.

   Several different mechanisms for authenticating a Mobile Node are
   supported.  The usage of the Internet Key Exchange v2 (IKEv2)
   protocol allows different mechanisms, such as the Extensible
   Authentication Protocol (EAP), certificates and pre-shared secrets in
   IKEv2 to be used.  Furthermore, another method makes use of the
   Mobile IPv6 Authentication protocol.  In addition to authentication
   authorization, the configuration of Mobile IPv6 specific parameters
   and accounting is specified in this document.

Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH Support     September 2007


1.  Introduction

   Performing the Mobile IPv6 protocol [1], requires the Mobile Node
   (MN) to own a Home Address (HoA) and assignment of a Home Agent (HA)
   to the MN.  The MN needs to register with the HA in order facilitate
   its reachability and mobility, when away from home.  The registration
   process itself requires establishment of IPsec security associations
   (SA) and cryptographic material between the MN and HA.  Providing the
   collection of home address, HA address and keying material is
   generally referred to as the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping problem [2].
   The purpose of this specification is to provide Diameter support for
   the interaction between the HA and the AAA server, as it is required
   for bootstrapping in the split scenario [13] and in the integrated
   scenario [14] in a manner that satisfies the requirements defined in
   [15].

   From an operator (mobility service provider, MSP) perspective, it is
   important to verify that the MN is authenticated and authorized to
   utilize Mobile IPv6 service and that such services are accounted for.
   Only when the MN is authenticated and authorized, the MSP allows the
   boostrapping of Mobile IPv6 parameters.  Thus, prior to processing
   the Mobile IPv6 service requests, the HA, participates in the
   authentication of the MN to verify the MN's identity.  The HA also
   participates in the Mobile IPv6 authorization process involving the
   Diameter infrastrucure.  The HA due to its role in traffic
   forwarding, also may also perform accounting for the Mobile IPv6
   service provided to the MN.

   This document enables the following functionality:

   Authentication:  Asserting or helping in asserting of the correctness
      of the MN identity.  As a Diameter client supporting the new
      Diameter Mobile IPv6 application, the HA may need to support more
      than one authentication type depending on the environment.
      Although the authentication is performed by the AAA server there
      is an impact for the HA as different set of command codes are
      needed for the respective authentication procedures.

   Authorization:  The HA must verify that the user is authorized to use
      the Mobile IPv6 service using the assistance of the MSP Diameter
      servers.  This is accomplised through the use of new Diameter
      commands specifically designed for performing Mobile IPv6
      authorization decisions.  This document defines these commands and
      requires the HA to support them and to participate in this
      authorization signaling.

   Accounting:  For accounting purposes and capacity planning, it is
      required of the HA to provide accounting report to the Diameter
      infrastructure and thus to support the related Diameter accounting
      procedures.


   Figure 1 depicts the architecture.

                      Figure 1: Architecture Overview

   Mobile IPv6 signaling between the MN and the HA can protected using
   two different mechanisms, namely using IPsec and via the MIPv6 Auth.
   Protocol.  Note that the actual mechanism to protect the MIPv6
   signaling messages is only indirectly relevant to this document.  The
   important aspect is, however, that for these two approaches several
   different authentication and key exchange solutions are available.
   To establish IPsec security associations for protection of Mobile
   IPv6 signaling messages IKEv2 is used, see [3].  IKEv2 supports EAP-
   based authentication, certificates and pre-shared secrets.  For
   protecting using the MIPv6 Auth.  Protocol [4] a mechanism has been
   designed that is very similar to the one used by Mobile IPv4.

   The ability to use different credentials has an impact on the
   interaction between the HA (acting as a Diameter client) and the
   Diameter Server.  For that reason this document illustrates the usage
   of these authentication mechanisms with different subsections for
   o  IKEv2 usage with EAP
   o  IKEv2 usage with certificates and pre-shared secrets
   o  MIPv6 Auth.  Protocol

   For accounting of Mobile IPv6 services provided to the MN, this
   specification uses the accounting application defined in [5].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6].

   The MIPv6 bootstrapping terminology is taken from [2].


3.  Advertising Application Support

   Diameter nodes conforming to this specification MUST advertise
   support by including the Diameter Mobile IPv6 Application ID value of
   [TO BE ASSIGNED BY IANA] in the Auth-Application-Id AVP of the
   Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer
   command [5].  The Acct-Application-id AVP needs to include the
   Diameter Base Accounting Application ID value of 3 (to support the
   split accounting model [16]).


4.  Protocol Description

4.1.  Support for Mobile IPv6 with IKEv2 and EAP

   The use of IKEv2 with EAP between the MN and the HA allows the AAA to
   authenticate the MN.  When EAP is used with IKEv2, the Diameter EAP
   application, as defined in [7], is re-used.  EAP methods that do not
   establish a shared key SHOULD NOT be used, as they are subject to a
   number of man-in-the-middle attacks as stated in Section 2.16 and
   Section 5 of RFC 4306 [8].  AVPs specific to Mobile IPv6
   bootstrapping are added to the EAP application commands.

   Figure 2 shows the message flow involved during the authentication
   phase when EAP is used.

Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH Support     September 2007


   In this phase cryptographic algorithms are negotiated, nonces and
   Diffie-Hellman parameters are exchanged.  Message (3) starts the
   IKE_AUTH phase.  This second phase authenticates the previous
   messages, exchanges identities and certificates and establishes the
   first CHILD_SA.  It is used to mutually authenticate the MN (acting
   as an IKEv2 Initiator) and the HA (acting as an IKEv2 Responder).
   The identity of the user/MN is provided in the IDi field.  The MN
   indicates its willingness to be authenticated via EAP by omitting the
   AUTH field in message (3) (see Section 2.16 of [8]).

   As part of the authentication process, the MN MAY request a Home-
   Address, a Home Prefix or suggests one, see [3], using a CFG_REQUEST
   payload in the message (3).

   The HA extracts the IDi field from the message (3) and sends a
   Diameter-EAP-Request (DER) message (4) towards the authenticating
   Diameter server.  The EAP-Payload AVP contains a EAP-Response/
   Identity with the identity extracted from the IDi field.

   This message is routed to the MNs Diameter server/EAP server.  The
   Diameter server selects the EAP method and replies with the DEA
   Message.  Depending on the type of EAP method chosen, a number of DER
   and DEA messages carry the method specific exchanges between the MN
   and the Diameter server/EAP server.

   At the end of the EAP authentication phase, the Diameter server
   indicates the result of the authentication in the Result-Code AVP and
   provides the corresponding EAP packet (EAP Success or EAP Failure).
   The last IKEv2 message sent by the HA contains the Home Address or
   the Home Prefix.  In the latter case, a CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange is
   necessary to setup IPsec SAs for Mobile IPv6 signalling.

   In some deployment scenario, the HA may also acts as a IKEv2
   Responder for IPsec VPN access.  A problem in this case is that the
   IKEv2 responder may not know if IKEv2 is used for MIP6 service or for
   IPsec VPN access.  A network operator needs to be aware of this
   limitation.

4.2.  Support for Mobile IPv6 with IKEv2 and Certificates

   When IKEv2 is used with certificate-based authentication, the
   Diameter NASREQ application [9] is used to authorize the MN for the
   Mobile IPv6 service.  The IDi payload extracted from the IKE_AUTH
   message MUST correspond to the identity in the MN's certificate.
   This identity is then used by the Home Agent to populate the User-
   Name AVP in the succeeding AA-Request message.  Further PKI-related
   procedures such as certificate revocation checking are out of scope
   of this document.

4.3.  Support for Mobile IPv6 with IKEv2 and Pre-Shared Secrets

   When IKEv2 is used with PSK-based initiator authentication, the
   Diameter NASREQ application [9] isused to authorize the MN for the
   Mobile IPv6 service.  The IDi payload extracted from the IKE_AUTH
   message has to contain an identity that is meaningful for the
   Diameter infrastructure, such as a Network Access Identifier (NAI),
   and is then used by the Home Agent to populate the User-Name AVP is
   the succeeding AA-Request message.

4.4.  Support for the Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol

   Figure 3 describes the sequence of messages sent and received between
   the MN, the HA and the Diameter server during the registration when
   MIPv6 Auth.  Protocol is used.  Binding Update (BU) and Binding
   Acknowledgement (BA) messages are used in the registration process.
   This exchange triggers the Diameter interaction.

   According to [4] the MN uses the Mobile Node Identifier Option,
   specifically the MN-NAI mobility option (as defined in [17]) to
   identify itself.

   The BU initiates a MIP6-Request-Message to the Diameter server and
   the corresponding response is carried in a MIP6-Answer-Message.  The
   Home Agent also provides the assigned Home Address to the Diameter
   server in the MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP.

4.5.  Mobile IPv6 Session Management

   The Diameter server may maintain state or may be stateless.  This is
   indicated in the Auth-Session-State AVP (or its absence).  The HA
   MUST support the Authorization Session State Machine defined in [5].
   Moreover, the following four commands may be exchanged between the HA
   and the Diameter server.

4.5.1.  Session-Termination-Request Command

   The Session-Termination-Request (STR) message [5] is sent by the HA
   to inform the Diameter server that an authorized session is being
   terminated.

4.5.2.  Session-Termination-Answer Command

   The Session-Termination-Answer (STA) message [5] is sent by the
   Diameter server to acknowledge the notification that the session has
   been terminated.

4.5.3.  Abort-Session-Request Command

   The Abort-Session-Request (ASR) message [5] is sent by the Diameter
   server to terminates the session.  This fulfills one of the
   requirement described in [15].

4.5.4.  Abort-Session-Answer Command

   The Abort-Session-Answer (ASA) message [5] is sent by the Home Agent
   in response to an ASR message.

4.6.  Accounting for Mobile IPv6 services

   The HA MUST be able act as a Diameter client collecting accounting
   records needed for service control and charging.  The HA MUST support
   the accounting procedures (specifically the command codes mentioned
   below) and the Accounting Session State Machine as defined in [5].
   The command codes, exchanged between the HA and Diameter server for
   accounting purposes, are provided in the following subsections.

   The Diameter application design guideline [16] defines two separate
   models for accounting:

   Split accounting model:

      According to this model, the accounting messages use the Diameter
      base accounting application ID (value of 3).  Since accounting is
      treated as an independent application, accounting commands may be

      routed separately from the rest of application messages and thus
      the accounting messages generally end up in a central accounting
      server.  Since Diameter Mobile IPv6 application does not define
      its own unique accounting commands, this is the prefered choice,
      since it permits use of centralized accounting for several
      applications.

   Coupled accounting model:

      In this model, the accounting messages will use the application ID
      of the Mobile IPv6 application.  This means that accounting
      messages will be routed like any other Mobile IPv6 application
      messages.  This requires the Diameter server in charge of Mobile
      IPv6 application to handle the accounting records (e.g., sends
      them to a proper accounting server).

   As mentioned above, the prefered choice is to use the split
   accounting model and thus to choose Diameter base accounting
   application ID (value of 3) for accounting messages.

4.6.1.  Accounting-Request Command

   The Accounting-Request command [5] is sent by the HA to the Diameter
   server to exchange accounting information regarding the MN with the
   Diameter server.

4.6.2.  Accounting-Answer Command

   The Accounting-Answer command [5] is sent by the Diameter server to
   the HA to acknowledge receiving an Accounting-Request.

   The MIP6-Answer-Message (MAM) message, indicated by the Command-Code
   field set to TBD and the 'R' bit cleared in the Command Flags field,
   is sent by the Diameter server in response to the MIP6-Request-
   Message message.  The User-Name MAY be included in the MAM if it is
   present in the MRM.  The Result-Code AVP MAY contain one of the
   values defined in Section 7, in addition to the values defined in RFC
   3588 [5].

   An MAM message with the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS MUST
   include the MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP.

   The message format is shown below.

Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH Support     September 2007


6.1.  User-Name AVP

   The User-Name AVP (AVP Code 2) is of type UTF8String and contains an
   NAI extracted from the MN-NAI mobility option included in the
   received BU message.  Alternatively, the NAI can be extracted from
   the IKEv2 IDi payload included in the IKE_SA_INIT message.

6.2.  MIP-MN-AAA-SPI AVP

   The MIP-MN-AAA-SPI AVP (AVP Code 341) is of type Unsigned32 and
   contains an SPI code extracted from the Mobility Message
   Authentication Option included in the received BU message.

   This AVP is re-used from [12].

6.3.  MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP

   The MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP (AVP Code 333) is of type Address and
   contains the Home Agent assigned IPv6 Home Address of the Mobile
   Node.

   If the MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP contains unspecified IPv6 address
   (0::0) in a request message, then the Home Agent expects the Diameter
   server to assign the Home Address in a subsequent reply message.  In
   case the Diameter server assigns only a prefix to the Mobile Node the
   lower 64 bits of the MIP-Mobile-Node-Address AVP provided address are
   set to zero.

   This AVP is re-used from [12].

6.4.  MIP-Home-Agent-Address AVP

   The MIP-Home-Agent-Address AVP (AVP Code 334) is of type Address and
   contains the IPv6 address of the Home Agent.  This AVP is re-used
   from [12].

6.5.  MIP-Careof-Address AVP

   The MIP-Careof-Address AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Address and
   contains the IPv6 Care-of Address of the Mobile Node.  The Home Agent
   extracts this IP address from the received BU message.

6.6.  MIP-Authenticator AVP

   The MIP-Authenticator AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and
   contains the Authenticator Data from the received BU message.  The
   Home Agent extracts this data from the MN-AAA Mobility Message
   Authentication Option included in the received BU message.

Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH Support     September 2007


6.7.  MIP-MAC-Mobility-Data AVP

   The MIP-MAC-Mobility-Data AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString
   and contains the calculated MAC_Mobility_Data, as defined in [4].

6.8.  MIP-Session-Key AVP

   The AVP (AVP Code 343) is of type OctetString and contains the MN-HA
   shared secret (i.e., the session key) for the associated Mobile IPv6
   MH-HA authentication option.  When the Diameter server computes the
   session key it is placed in this AVP.

   This AVP is re-used from [12].

6.9.  MIP-MSA-Lifetime AVP

   The AVP (AVP Code 367) is of type Unsigned32 and represents the
   period of time (in seconds) for which the session key (see
   Section 6.8) or nonce (see Section 6.13) is valid.  The associated
   session key or nonce MUST NOT be used if the lifetime has expired.

   This AVP is re-used from [12].

6.10.  MIP-MN-to-HA-MSA AVP

   The AVP (AVP Code 331) is of type Grouped and contains the session
   related information for use with the MIPv6 Auth.  Protocol.


   MIP-MN-to-HA-MSA ::= < AVP Header: 331 >
                        { MIP-Algorithm-Type }

                        { MIP-nonce }
                      * [ AVP ]

   This AVP is re-used from [12].

6.11.  MIP-Algorithm-Type AVP

   The AVP (AVP Code 345) is of type Enumerated and contains Algorithm
   identifier for the associated Mobile IPv6 MN-HA Authentication
   Option.  The Diameter server selects the algorithm type.  Existing
   algorithm types are defined in RFC 4004 that also fulfill current RFC
   4285 requirements.  This AVP is re-used from [12].

Internet-Draft      Diameter MIP6: HA-to-AAAH Support     September 2007


6.12.  MIP-Replay-Mode AVP

   The AVP (AVP Code 346) is of type Enumerated and contains the replay
   mode the Home Agent for authenticating the mobile node.  The replay
   modes, defined in RFC 4004 [12], are supported.  This AVP is re-used
   from [12].

6.13.  MIP-nonce AVP

   The AVP (AVP Code 335) is of type OctetString and contains the nonce
   sent to the Mobile Node.  This AVP is re-used from [12].  At the time
   of writing the MIPv6 Auth.  Protocol does not require use of nonces
   for replay protection between the MN and the Diameter server.  Thus,
   the Home Agent is allowed to ignore the returned MIP-Nonce AVP.

6.14.  MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP

   This AVP is defined in [11].

6.15.  MIP-Timestamp AVP

   The MIP-Timestamp AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Time and may contain
   the timestamp value from the Mobility message replay protection
   option, defined in [4].  The Home Agent extracts this value from the
   received BU message, if available.

   The support for replay protection is an optional feature in [4].
   When the Diameter server checks the timestamp provided by the MN via
   the HA and recognizes a clock-drift (outside a locally defined replay
   protection window) then it MUST initiate the re-synchronization
   procedure by returning a MIP6-Answer-Message with Result-Code set to
   MIP6-TIMESTAMP-MISMATCH and attaches the MIP-Timestamp AVP including
   it's current time back to the HA.

6.16.  QoS-Capability AVP

   The QoS-Capability AVP is defined in [10] and contains a list of
   supported Quality of Service profiles.

6.17.  QoS-Resources AVP

   The QoS-Resources AVP is defined in [10] and provides QoS and packet
   filtering capabilities.

6.18.  Accounting AVPs

   This document reuses the accounting AVPs defined in Diameter Mobile
   IPv4 application [12], namely:

   Accounting-Output-Octets:

      Number of octets in IP packets sent by the user

   Accounting-Input-Packets:

      Number of IP packets received from the user

   Accounting-Output-Packets:

      Number of IP packets sent by the user.


7.  Result-Code AVP Values

   This section defines new Result-Code [5] values that MUST be
   supported by all Diameter implementations that conform to this
   specification.

7.1.  Transient Failures

   Errors in the transient failures category are used to inform a peer
   that the request could not be satisfied at the time it was received,
   but that it may be able to satisfy the request in the future.

   MIP6-TIMESTAMP-MISMATCH    TBD

      This error code is used by the home agent to indicate to the HA
      that the timestamp value provided as part of the MN-AAA option has
      an inacceptable clock-drift.

7.2.  Permanent Failures

   Errors that fall within the permanent failures category are used to
   inform the peer that the request failed and SHOULD NOT be attempted
   again.

   DIAMETER_ERROR_END_TO_END_MIP6_KEY_ENCRYPTION     TBD

      This error is used by the Diameter server to inform the peer that
      the requested Mobile IPv6 session keys could not be delivered via
      a security association.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the namespaces that have either been created in
   this specification or had their values assigned to existing
   namespaces managed by IANA.

9.1.  Command Codes

   IANA is requested to allocate a command code value for the MIP6-
   Request-Message (MRM) and for the MIP6-Answer-Message (MAM) from the
   Command Code namespace defined in [5].  See Section 5 for the
   assignment of the namespace in this specification.

9.2.  AVP Codes

   This specification requires IANA to register the following new AVPs
   from the AVP Code namespace defined in [5].
   o  MIP-Careof-Address

   o  MIP-Authenticator
   o  MIP-MAC-Mobility-Data
   o  MIP-Timestamp
   The AVPs are defined in Section 6.

9.3.  Result-Code AVP Values

   This specification requests IANA to allocate new values to the
   Result-Code AVP (AVP Code 268) namespace defined in [5].  See
   Section 7 for the assignment of the namespace in this specification.

9.4.  Application Identifier

   This specification requires IANA to allocate a new value for
   "Diameter Mobile IPv6" from the Application Identifier namespace
   defined in [5].


10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the Diameter interaction required to
   accomplish the split scenario are described in in [13].
   Additionally, the security considerations of the Diameter Base
   protocol [5], Diameter EAP application [7] are applicable to this
   document.  This document does not introduce new security
   vulnerabilities.
