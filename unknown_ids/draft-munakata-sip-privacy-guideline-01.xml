    <abstract>
      <t>This is an informational document that provides guidelines for using the privacy mechanism for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), that is specified in RFC 3323 and subsequently extended in RFCs 3325 and 4244. It is intended to clarify the handling of the target SIP headers/parameters and SDP attributes for each of the privacy header values (priv-values).</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>This document clarifies the privacy mechanism for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> defined in <xref target="RFC3323"></xref>, which was later extended in <xref target="RFC3325"></xref> and <xref target="RFC4244"></xref>.  This document describes the practical manner of operations of the privacy mechanism as a guideline and has no intention of changing the existing privacy mechanism.</t>

      <t>In RFC 3323, the semantics of the basic set of priv-values (header, session, user, none, and critical) is defined, but there are some ambiguities in regards to the target headers to be obscured per priv-value are not explicitly specified.  An ambiguity such as this could result in different interpretations of privacy handling for each of the priv-values defined, both at an entity setting a Privacy header and at an entity processing the Privacy header, which could have an adverse impact on interoperability.</t>

      <t>Additional priv-values, "id" and "history", are defined in RFCs 3325 and 4244, respectively.</t>

      <t>In RFC 4244, the priv-value "history" is defined in order to request privacy for History-Info headers, and the target to be obscured for "history" priv-value is specified as only the History-Info headers.  In addition, the RFC clearly describes that History-Info headers are also the target when "header" and "session" level privacy are requested.</t>

      <t>On the other hand, RFC 3325 defines the P-Asserted-Identity header and a priv-value "id", which is used to request privacy for only the P-Asserted-Identity header, but it does not specify how other priv-values may impact the privacy handling of the P-Asserted-Identity header. Because of this implicitness, it has been observed that some implementations are suffering from the inability to achieve the intended privacy due to discrepancies in interpretations.</t>

      <t>This document tries to clarify the SIP headers to be obscured for each of the priv-values to alleviate the potential interoperability issues already seen due to a lack of explicit text.</t>
    </section>


    <section title="Terminology">

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.

      <list hangIndent="12" style="hanging">
        <t hangText="priv-value:">Values registered with IANA to be used in the Privacy header.  Registered priv-values are "header", "session", "user", "none", and "critical" defined in <xref target="RFC3323"></xref>, "id" defined in <xref target="RFC3325"></xref>, and "history" defined in <xref target="RFC4244"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Tables in this section show the recommended treatment of SIP headers and SDP attributes per priv-value.  SIP headers and SDP attributes not shown in the tables are regarded as non-targets of these priv-values.  Some non-target SIP headers/SDP attributes may carry privacy-sensitive information which may need privacy treatment regardless of the privacy level requested. This is further described in 6.4.</t>

      <t>The way in which SIP headers and SDP attributes listed here are obscured may depend on the implementation and network policy. This document does not prevent different variations that may exist based on local policy but tries to provide recommendations for how a privacy service treats SIP headers and SDP attributes.

      <section title="Treatment of priv-value Not Supported by the Privacy Service">

        <t>As specified in RFC 3323, if the priv-value of "critical" is present in the Privacy header of a request, and if the privacy service is incapable of performing all of the levels of privacy specified in the Privacy header, it MUST fail the request with a 500 (Server Error) response code.</t>

        <t>Since the protection of privacy is important, even if the priv-value "critical" is not present in the Privacy header, the privacy service SHOULD fail the request with a 500 response code when it is incapable of performing all of the levels of privacy specified in the Privacy header.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Recommended Treatment of User-Privacy-Related Information">

      <t>The following SIP headers and related parameters may concern privacy.  This section describes what kind of user-privacy-related information may be included in each SIP header/parameter, and how to maintain privacy for such information at a user agent or a privacy service when the information is indeed privacy sensitive.</t>

      <section anchor="target_header" title="Target SIP Headers">

        <t>This section describes privacy considerations and recommended treatment for each SIP header that may reveal user-privacy-related information.  This section goes into details about how each header affects privacy, the desired treatment of the value by the user agent and privacy service, and other instructions/additional notes necessary to provide privacy.</t>

        <section title="Call-ID">

          <t>This field frequently contains an IP address or hostname of a UAC (User Agent Client) appended to the Call-ID value.</t>

          <t>A user agent executing a user-level privacy function on its own SHOULD exclude the host name and IP address from a Call-ID header.</t>

          <t>A privacy service MAY delete the host name and IP address from a Call-ID header or anonymize them by using a functional anonymous URI or IP address when the request contains Privacy:user.  This is generally done by replacing the IP address or host name with that of the privacy service.</t>

          <t>Call-ID is essential to dialog matching, so any time a privacy service modifies this field, it MUST retain the former value and restore it in a Call-ID header in any messages that are sent to/by the originating user agent inside the dialog.  A privacy service SHOULD be prepared to receive a request outside the dialog containing the value of the Call-ID set by the PS in other SIP headers (e.g., In-Reply-To/Replaces/Target-Dialog), at least while the dialog state is active for the dialog whose Call-ID was modified by that PS.  When such a request is received, the Call-ID value contained in the relevant headers indicated above SHOULD be replaced by the retained value.

          <list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Note:">This is possible only if the privacy service maintains the state and retains all the information it modified to provide privacy.  Some PSs are known to encrypt information prior to obfuscation in the Via header etc.  In this case, the PS cannot correlate the modified Call-ID value with the original Call-ID.  Further challenges are imposed when the PS needs to stay on a signaling path to ensure that it receives all the messages targeted towards the caller that a PS provides privacy for, especially when the request is out-of-dialog.</t></list></t>

          <t>Refer to the corresponding sections, 5.1.8 (In-Reply-To), 5.3.2 (Replaces), and 5.3.5 (Target-Dialog), for detailed discussion.</t>
        </section>


        <section title="Call-Info">

          <t>This field contains additional information about the user.</t>

          <t>A user agent executing a user-level privacy function on its own SHOULD NOT add a Call-Info header.</t>

          <t>A privacy service MUST delete a Call-Info header if one exists when user privacy is requested with Privacy:user.  A privacy service SHOULD NOT add a Call-Info header when user privacy is requested with Privacy:header.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Contact">
          <t>This field contains a URI used to reach the user agent for mid-dialog requests and possibly out-of-dialog requests, such as REFER <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>.  Since the Contact header is essential for routing further requests to the user agent, it must include a functional URI even when it is anonymized.</t>

          <t>A user agent SHOULD NOT anonymize a Contact header, unless it can obtain an IP address or contact address that is functional yet has characteristic of anonymity.  This may be possible by obtaining an IP address specifically for this purpose either from the service provider or through feature such as GRUU <xref target="I-D.ietf-sip-gruu"></xref> and TURN <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"></xref>.
</t>

          <t>A privacy service SHOULD anonymize a Contact header using a functional anonymous URI when user privacy is requested with Privacy:header.  This is generally done by replacing the IP address or host name with that of the privacy service.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="From">

          <t>This field contains the identity of the user, such as display-name and URI.</t>

          <t>A user agent executing a user-level privacy function on its own SHOULD anonymize a From header using an anonymous display-name and an anonymous URI.</t>

          <t>A privacy service SHOULD anonymize a From header when user privacy is requested with Privacy:user.</t>

          <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Note:">This does not prevent a privacy service from anonymizing the From header based on local policy.</t></list></t>

          <t>The anonymous display-name and anonymous URI mentioned in this section use display-name "Anonymous" and a URI with "anonymous" in the user portion of the From header and the hostname value "anonymous.invalid", as indicated in RFC 3323.</t>

          <t>The recommended form of the From header for anonymity is:</t>

          <t>From: "Anonymous" &lt;sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid>;tag=1928301774</t>
        </section>

        <section title="History-Info">
          <t>History-Info <xref target="RFC4244"></xref> header URIs to which the request was forwarded or retargeted can reveal general routing information.</t>

          <t>A user agent executing a user-level privacy function on its own SHOULD NOT add a History-Info header.</t>

          <t>A privacy service SHOULD delete the History-Info headers when user privacy is requested with Privacy:header, Privacy:session, or Privacy:history.</t>

          <t>The privacy could be also expressed for a specific History-Info entry by inserting "privacy=history" in the History-Info header.  In such a case, a privacy service SHOULD delete the History-Info entry.</t>

          <t>Refer to <xref target="RFC4244"></xref> for detailed behavior for dealing with History-Info headers.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="In-Reply-To">

          <t>The In-Reply-To header contains a Call-ID of the referenced dialog.  The replying user may be identified by the Call-ID in a In-Reply-To header.</t>

          <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Alice > INV(Call-ID:C1) > Bob
Bob   > INV(In-Reply-To:C1) > Alice
          ]]></artwork></figure>

          <t>In this case, unless the In-Reply-To header is deleted, Alice might notice that the replying user is Bob because Alice's UA knows that the Call-ID relates to Bob.</t>

          <t>A user agent executing a user-level privacy function on its own SHOULD NOT add an In-Reply-To header.</t>

          <t>A privacy service MUST delete the In-Reply-To header when user privacy is requested with Privacy:user.</t>

          <t>In addition, since an In-Reply-To header contains the Call-ID of the dialog it is replying to, special attention is required, as described in Section 5.1.1 (Call-ID) regardless of the priv-value or presence of a Privacy header.  Once a privacy service modifies a Call-ID in the request, a privacy service SHOULD restore the former value in an In-Reply-To header, if present in the INVITE request replying to the original request, as long as the privacy service maintains the dialog state.</t>

          <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Example:

        </section>

        <section title="Record-Route">

          <t>This field may reveal information about the administrative domain of the user.</t>

          <t>In order to hide Record-Route headers while keeping routability to the sender, privacy services can execute a practice referred to as "stripping".  Stripping means removing all the Record-Route headers that have been added to the request prior to its arrival at the privacy service and then adding a single Record-Route header representing itself.  In this case, the privacy service needs to retain the removed headers and restore them in a response.</t>

          <t>In addition, privacy services can remove the Record-Route headers and encrypt them into a single header.  In this case, the privacy service needs to decrypt the header and restore the former values in a response.</t>

          <t>A privacy service SHOULD strip or encrypt any Record-Route headers that have been added to a message before it reaches the privacy service when user privacy is requested with Privacy:header.</t>

          <t>As in the case of a Call-ID, if a privacy service modifies the Record-Route headers, it MUST be able to restore Route headers with retained values.  Some examples where the restoration of the Route headers is necessary and unnecessary are given below.</t>

          <t>When a UAC (Alice) requires privacy for a request, a privacy service does not have to restore the Route headers (See Example 1).</t>

          <t>On the other hand, when a UAS (User Agent Server) (Bob) requires privacy for a response, a privacy service has to restore the Route headers in the response (See Example 2).</t>

      <section anchor="non_target"
           title="Considerations for Non-Target SIP Headers/Parameters">

        <section title="Identity/Identity-Info">

          <t>The Identity <xref target="RFC4474"></xref> header field contains a signature used for validating the identity.  The Identity-Info header field contains a reference to the certificate of the signer of Identity headers.  An Identity-Info header may reveal information about the administrative domain of the user.</t>

          <t>The signature in an Identity header provides integrity protection over the From, To, Call-ID, Cseq, Date, and Contact headers and over the message body.  The integrity protection is violated if a privacy service modifies these headers and/or the message body for the purpose of user privacy protection.</t>

          <t>The treatment of the Identity and Identity-Info headers may depend on the deployment scenario: the desired deployment will have a privacy service located before or co-located with the identity service; thus, integrity and privacy can both be provided seamlessly.</t>

          <t>When the privacy service is located after the identity services, several different scenarios can be considered.</t>

          <t>When a privacy service receives a request with an Identity header and it has the capability to provide a signature, it may re-compute the signature using its own certificate and replace the value of the Identity header and replace the value of the Identity-Info header with a reference to its own certificate after executing privacy functions on relevant headers that are considered to be privacy sensitive (From, Contact, etc.) and/or the message body.</t>

          <t>If the privacy service cannot compute the signature because it lacks the authority or lacks a valid certificate, it may delete both the Identity and the Identity-Info headers when user privacy is requested with Privacy:user, Privacy:header, or Privacy:session.  However, because the message loses the valuable property that identity service provides, this is not RECOMMENDED.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Path">

          <t>This field may contain information about the administrative domain and/or the visited domain of the user agent.  However, the Path header is not the target of any priv-values.</t>

          <t>Path headers <xref target="RFC3327"></xref> only appear in REGISTER requests and responses.  Given that a user agent sends a REGISTER request with Privacy:user or Privacy:header, Path headers inserted by intermediaries may contain information about the domain where the user is visiting, and there is no point in hiding such user location information from the registrar that receives the REGISTER request.</t>

          <t>The only reason privacy may be considered desirable is if the visited domain wants to withhold its topology from the home domain of the user.  However, anonymization of network-privacy-related information is out of scope.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Replaces Header/Parameter">

          <t>The Replaces <xref target="RFC3891"></xref> header and the "replaces" parameter contain identifiers of a dialog to be replaced, which are composed of Call-ID, local tag, and remote tag.</t>

          <t>The sender of the INVITE with a Replaces header is never the originating user agent or terminating user agent of the target dialog to be replaced.  Therefore the Call-ID within the Replaces header is never generated by the sender.  Therefore, this header is outside the anonymization target per priv-value.</t>

          <t>The "replaces" parameter is not the target of any particular priv-values either.  The parameter appears in a Refer-To header in a REFER request, and its functionality when anonymized depends on the circumstances in which it is used.  REFER may work or may not work depending on the following three criteria.</t>

          <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
1.  Who generated the Call-ID.
2.  Where the privacy service is on the signaling path.
3.  Who initiates the REFER with "replaces" parameter.
          ]]></artwork></figure>

          <t>In addition, as described in Section 5.1.1 (Call-ID), regardless of the priv-value or the presence of a Privacy header, once a privacy service modifies a Call-ID in the request, it SHOULD monitor headers that may contain Call-ID and restore the portion of the value representing the modified Call-ID to the original Call-ID value in a Replaces header received.</t>

          <t>The main challenge for this to function properly is that a privacy service has to be on a signaling path to the originator for every dialog.  This is generally not possible.</t>

          <t>A few examples that explore when the Replaces header/parameter works or fails are given below.</t>

          <figure><artwork><![CDATA[

        <section title="Route">

          <t>This field may contain information about the administrative domain of the user agent, but the Route header is not the target of any priv-values.</t>

          <t>Route headers appear only in SIP requests to force routing through the listed set of proxies.  If a privacy service anonymizes the Route header, the routing does not function.  Furthermore, there is no risk in revealing the information in the Route headers to further network entities including the terminating user agent because a proxy removes the value from the Route header when it replaces the value in the Request-URI, as defined in RFC 3261.</t>

          <t>A privacy service that modifies Record-Route headers may need to restore the values in Route headers as necessary .  Please refer to Section 5.1.11 (Record-Route) for details.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Service-Route">

          <t>Service-Route headers <xref target="RFC3608"></xref> appear only in 200 OK responses to REGISTER requests and contain information about the registrar.  The purpose of the privacy mechanism defined in RFC 3323 is to secure the user's privacy, so the case where a registrar sets a Privacy header is not considered here.  Therefore, the Service-Route header is not the target of any priv-values.</t>

          <t>Furthermore, if the Service-Route is replaced with another value that is less sensitive (that of an SBC etc.), it is not because it was requested by the user but probably for the convenience of the domain policy/network policy.  The use of privacy for this purpose seems illogical.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Target-Dialog">

          <t>The Target-Dialog <xref target="RFC4538"></xref> header faces exactly the same issues as seen for the Replaces header.  Please refer to Section 5.3.2 (Replaces) for why this is not a target for any particular priv-values and how a privacy service still needs to evaluate and modify the value contained, even if no privacy is requested.</t>
