        Authentication Mechanism of Port Control Protocol (PCP)
                 draft-wasserman-pcp-authentication-00

Abstract

   A IPv6 or IPv4 host can use the Port Control Protocol (PCP) to
   flexibly re-configure its network address translators (NATs) or
   firewalls, change their ways in translating and forwarding IP
   packets, and eventually facilitate its communications with remote
   hosts.  However, the un-controlled generation or deletion of IP
   address mappings on such network devices may cause security risks and
   should be avoided.  Before a PCP request is eventually executed, the
   requester needs to prove that it is a legal PCP user and has a
   sufficient privilege.  This document proposes an in-band
   authentication mechanism for PCP.  The Extensible Authentication
   Protocol (EAP) is taken advantage of to perform authentication
   between PCP devices.

Internet-Draft           authentication for PCP             October 2011


1.  Introduction

   With the Port Control Protocol (PCP), a IPv6 or IPv4 host can
   flexibly manage the IP address mapping information on its network
   address translators (NATs) and firewalls, and control their policies
   in processing incoming and outgoing IP packets.  Because NATs and
   firewalls both play important roles in network security
   architectures, in many typical scenarios, authentication and access
   control are required to prevent un-authorized users from accessing
   such devices.  This document proposes a PCP security extension which
   enables PCP devices to authenticate the ones that they are
   communicating with using Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).
   Particularly, following issues are considered in the design of this
   extension:

   o  Lose of EAP messages during transportation

   o  Disordered delivery of EAP messages

   o  Generation of transport keys

   o  Integrity protection and data origin authentication for PCP
      messages

   o  Algorithm agility

   Many ideas of this work is brought from PANA[RFC5191].


2.  Terminology

   Most of the terms used in this document are introduced from
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].

   PCP Client (PCC): A PCP device (e.g., a host) which is responsible
   for issuing PCP requests to a PCP server.  In this document, a PCC is
   also a EAP peer [RFC3748], and it is the responsibility of a PCC to
   provide the credentials when authentication is required.

   PCP Server (PCS): A PCP device (e.g., a NAT or a firewall) that
   implements the server-side of the PCP protocol, via which PCCs
   request and manage explicit mappings.  In this document, a PCS is
   integrated with an EAP authenticator[RFC3748].  Therefore, when
   necessary, a PCS can verify the credentials provided by a PCC and
   make an access control decision based on the authentication result.

   PCP Authentication (PA) Session: A series of PCP message exchanges
   transferred between a PCC and a PCS in order to perform

Internet-Draft           authentication for PCP             October 2011


   authentication, authorization, key distribution and secured PCP
   communication.  Each PA session is assigned a distinctive Session ID.
   The PCP devices involved within a PA session are called session
   partners.  A typical PA session has two session partners.

   PCP Security Association (PCP SA): A PCP security association is
   formed between a PCC and a PCS by sharing cryptographic keying
   material and associated context.  The formed duplex security
   association is used to protect the bidirectional PCP signaling
   traffic between the PCC and PCS.

   Session Lifetime: A duration associated with a PA session.  For an
   established PA session, the session lifetime is bound to the lifetime
   of the current authorization decision given to the PCC.  The session
   lifetime can be extended by a new round of EAP authentication before
   it expires.  Until a PA session is established, the lifetime SHOULD
   be set to a value that allows the PCC to detect a failed session in a
   reasonable amount of time.

   Master Session Key (MSK): A key derived by the partners of a PA
   session, using a EAP key generating method specified in [RFC3748].

   PA (PCP for Authentication) message: A PCP message containing an
   Authentication OpCode for EAP authentication.


3.  Protocol Details

3.1.  Sessin Initiation

   To carry out an EAP authentication process between two PCP devices, a
   set of PA messages need to be exchanged.  Each PA message contains an
   Authentication OpCode (and additional Options if needed).  The
   Authentication OpCode consists of four fields: Session ID, Flag, EAP
   Type, and Sequence Number.  The Session ID field is used to identify
   the session which the message belongs to.  The Flag field indicates
   the type of the PCP message, while EAP Type is used to identify the
   type of the attached EAP message.  The sequence number field is used
   to detect the disorder or the duplication occurred during packet
   delivery.

   The message exchanges conveyed within an PA session is introduced in
   the remainder section.

   When a PCC intends to initiate a PA session with a PCS, it sends a
   PCC-Initiation message to the PCS.  The Session ID and Sequence
   Number fields of the OpCode in the PCC-Initiation are set as 0.
   After receiving the PCC-Initiation, if the PCS would like to initiate

   a PA session, it will reply with a PA-Request which contains an EAP
   Identity Request.  The Sequence Number field in the PA-Request is set
   as 0, and the Session ID field MUST be filled with the identifier
   assigned by the PCS for this session.  Otherwise, the PCS discards
   the message silently.  If the PCC intends to simplify the
   authentication process, it can append an EAP Identity Response
   message within the PCC-Initiation request so as to skip over the step
   of waiting for the EAP Identity Request and inform the PCS that it
   would like to perform EAP authentication.

   In the scenario where a PCS receives a PCP message other than a PCC-
   Initiation from a PCC which needs to be authenticated, the PCS can
   reply with a PA-Request to initiate a PA session; the result code
   field of the PA-Request is set as AUTHENTICATION-REQUIRED.  In
   addition, the PCS MUST assign a session ID for the session and
   transfer it within the initial PA-Request.  In the PA messages
   exchanged afterwards in this session, the session ID MUST be
   appended.  Therefore, in the subsequent communication, the PCC can
   distinguish the messages in this session from those in other sessions
   through the PCS IP address and the session ID.  When the PCC receives
   the initial PA-Request message from the PCS, it can reply with a PA-
   Answer message to continue the session or silently discards the
   request message according to its local policies.

   In a PA session, PA-Request messages are sent from PCSs to PCCs while
   PA-Answer messages are only sent from PCCs to PCSs.  Correspondently,
   an EAP request messages MUST be transported within a PA-Request
   message, and an EAP answer messages MUST be transported within a PA-
   Answer message.  Particularly, when a PCP device receives a PA-
   Request or a PA-Answer message from its partner and cannot generate a
   response within a pre-specified period due to certain reasons (e.g.,
   waiting for human input to construct a EAP message), the PCP device
   needs to reply with a PA-Acknowledge message to indicate that the
   message has been received.  Therefore, the partner does not have to
   un-necessarily retransfer the PCP message.

   In this work, it is mandated for a PCC and a PCS to perform a key-
   generating EAP method in authentication, and so a successful EAP
   authentication process will result in a MSK.  If the PCC and the PCS
   want to generate a traffic key using the MSK, they need to agree upon
   a Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) for the transport key derivation and a
   MAC algorithm to provide data origin authentication for subsequent
   PCP signaling packets.  On this occasion, the PCS needs to append the
   initial PA-Request message with a set of PRF Options and MAC
   Algorithm Options which contain the PRFs and the MAC (Message
   Authentication Code) algorithms the PCS supports respectively.  After
   receiving the request, the PCC selects a PRF and a MAC algorithm
   which it intends to support, and sends back a PA-Answer with a PRF

Internet-Draft           authentication for PCP             October 2011


   Option and a MAC Algorithm Option for the selected algorithms.

   The last PA-Request message transported within a PA session carries
   the EAP authentication and PCP authorization results.  The last PA-
   Request and PA-Answer messages MUST have their the 'C' (Complete) bit
   set.

   If the EAP authentication successes, the result code of the last PA-
   Request is Authentication-Success.  In this case, before sending out
   the PA-Request, the PCS must derive a transport key and use it to
   generate digests to protect the integrity and authenticity of the PA-
   Request and any subsequent PCP message.  Such digests are transported
   within Authentication Tag Options.  In addition, the PA-Request needs
   to be appended with a Session Lifetime Option which indicates the
   life time of the PA session (i.e., the life time of the MSK).

   If the EAP authentication fails, the result code of the last PA-
   Request is Authentication-Failed.  If the EAP authentication
   successes but Authorization fails, the result code of the last PA-
   Request is Authorization-Failed.  In the latter two cases, the PA
   session MUST be terminated immediately after the last PCP
   authentication message exchange.

3.2.  Session Termination

   A PA session can be explicitly terminated by sending a termination-
   indicating PA acknowledge message from either session partner.  After
   receiving a termination-indicating message from the session partner,
   the other PCP device involved in the session MUST response with a
   termination-indicating PA Acknowledge message and remove the PA SA
   immediately.  When the session partner initiating the termination
   process receives the acknowledge message, it will remove the
   associated PA SA immediately.

3.3.  Result Codes

   Following result codes are defined in the solution:

   XXX AUTHENTICATION-REQUIRED

   XXX AUTHENTICATION-FAILED

   XXX AUTHENTICATION-SUCCESS

   XXX AUTHORIZATION-FAILED

4.  PA Security Association

   At the beginning a PA session, a session SHOULD generate a PA SA to
   maintain its state information during the session.  A The parameters
   of a PA SA is listed as follows:

   o  IP address and UDP port number of the PCC

   o  IP address and UDP port number of the PCS

   o  Session Identifier

   o  Sequence number for the next outgoing PCP message

   o  Sequence number for the next incoming PCP message

   o  Last transmitted message payload

   o  Retransmission interval

   o  MSK

   o  MAC algorithm: The algorithm that the transport key should use to
      generate digests for PCP messages.

   o  Pseudo-random function: The pseudo random function negotiated in
      the initial PA-Request and PA-Answer exchange for the transport
      key derivation

   o  Transport key: the key derived from the MSK to provide integrity
      protection and data origin authentication for the messages in the
      PA session.  The life time of the transport key SHOULD be
      identical to the life time of the session.

   Particularly, the transport key is computed in the following way:
   Transport key = prf(MSK, "IETF PCP"| Session_ID), where:

   o  The prf: The pseudo-random function assigned in the Pseudo-random
      function parameter.

   o  MSK: The master session key generated by the EAP method.

   o  "IETF PCP": The ASCII code representation of the non-NULL
      terminated string (excluding the double quotes around it).

   o  Session_ID: The ID of the session which the MSK is derived from

6.  Processing Rules

6.1.  Authentication Data Generation

   If a PCP SA is generated as the result of an successful EAP
   authentication process, every subsequent PCP message within the
   session needs carry an Authentication Tag Option which contains the
   digest of the PCP message for data orgin authentication and integrity

   protection.

   Before generating a digest for a PCP message, a device needs to first
   select a traffic key in the session and append the Authentication Tag
   Option at the end of the protected PCP message.  The length of the
   Authentication Data field is decided by the MAC algorithm adopted in
   the session.  The device then fills the Session ID field and the PCP
   SA ID field, and sets the Authentication Data field as 0.  After
   this, the device generates a digest for the PCP message with the MAC
   algorithm and the selected traffic key, and input the generated
   digest into the Authentication Data field.

6.2.  Authentication Data Validation

   When a device receives a PCP pacekt with an Authentication Tag
   Option, it needs to use the session ID transported in the option to
   locate the proper session ID, and then find out the associated
   transport key and the MAC algorithm.  After storing the value of the
   Authentication field of the Authentication Tag Option, the device
   fills the the Authentication field with zeros.  Then, the device
   generates a digest for the packet with the transport key and the MAC
   algorithm found in the first step.  If the value of the newly
   generated digest is identical to the stored one, the device can
   ensure that the packet has not been tampered during the
   transportation.  The validation successes.  Otherwise, the packet
   MUST be discarded.

6.3.  Sequence Number

   PCP adopts UDP to transport signaling messages.  As an un-reliable
   transporting protocol, UDP does not guarantee the ordered packet
   delivery and does not provide any protection from packet loss.  In
   order to ensure the EAP messages are exchanged in a reliable way,
   every PCP packet exchanged during EAP authentication must carries an
   monotonically increased sequence number.  During a PA session, a PCP
   device needs to maintain two sequence numbers, one for incoming
   packets and one for outgoing packets.  When generating an outgoing
   PCP packet, the device attaches the outgoing sequence number to the
   packet.  If the outgoing packet, the device then increments the
   sequence number by 1.  When receiving a PCP packet from its session
   partner, the device will not accept it if the sequence number carried
   in the packet matches the incoming sequence number the device
   maintains.  After confirming that the received packet is valid, the
   device increments the incoming sequence number by 1.  However, the
   above rules are not applied to PA-Acknowledgement messages.  When
   receiving or sending out a PA-Acknowledgement message, the device
   MUST not inicrease the correspondent sequence number.  Another
   exception is message retransmission.  When a device does not receive

   any response message from its session partner in a certain period, it
   needs to retransmit the last sent message with a limited rate.  The
   value of the sequence number in the duplicate messages MUST be
   identical to that of the original message.  When the device receives
   such duplicate messages from its session partner, it MUST tries to
   answer them by sending the last outgoing message within a limited
   rate unless it has received another valid message with a larger
   sequence number from its session.  Note that in these cases the
   outgoing sequence number will not be affected by the message
   retransmission.

6.4.  Retransmission Policies

   This work provides a retransmission mechanism for reliable PA message
   delivery.  The timer, the variables, and the rules used in this
   mechanism is mostly brought from PANA[RFC5191].

   The retransmission behavior is controlled and described by the
   following variables:

      RT: Retransmission timeout from the previous (re)transmission

      IRT: Base value for RT for the initial retransmission

      MRC: Maximum retransmission count

      MRT: Maximum retransmiting time interval

      RAND: Randomization factor

   With each message transmission or retransmission, the sender sets RT
   according to the rules given below.

   If RT expires before receiving any reply, the sender re-calculates RT
   and retransmits the message.  Each of the computations of a new RT
   include a randomization factor (RAND), which is a random number
   chosen with a uniform distribution between -0.1 and +0.1.  The
   randomization factor is included to minimize the synchronization of
   messages.  The algorithm for choosing a random number does not need
   to be cryptographically sound.  The algorithm SHOULD produce a
   different sequence of random numbers from each invocation.  RT for
   the first message retransmission is based on IRT:

   RT = IRT

   RT for each subsequent message retransmission is based on the
   previous value of RT (RTprev):

Internet-Draft           authentication for PCP             October 2011


   RT = (2+RAND) * RTprev

   MRT specifies an upper bound on the value of RT (disregarding the
   randomization added by the use of RAND).  If MRT has a value of 0,
   there is no upper limit on the value of RT.  Otherwise:

   if (RT > MRT)

   RT = (1+RAND) * MRT

   MRC specifies an upper bound on the number of times a sender may
   retransmit a message.  Unless MRC is zero, the message exchange fails
   once the sender has transmitted the message MRC times.  In this case,
   the sender needs to start a session termination process illustrated
   in Section 3.2.

7.  IANA Considerations

8.  Security Considerations

   In this work, a successful EAP authentication process performed
   between two PCP devices will result in the generation of a MSK which
   can be used to derive the transport keys to generate MAC digests for
   subsequent PCP message exchanges.  This work does not exclude the
   possibility of using the MSK to generate keys for different security
   protocols to enable per-packet cryptographic protection.  The methods
   of deriving the transport key for the security protocols is out of
   scope of this document.

   However, before a transport key has been generated, the PA messages
   exchanged within a PA session have little cryptographic protection,
   and if there is no already established security channel between two
   session partners, these messages are subject to man-in-the-middle
   attacks and DOS attacks.  For instance, the initial PA-Request and
   PA-Answer exchange is vulnerable to spoofing attacks as these
   messages are not authenticated and integrity protected.  In order to
   prevent very basic DOS attacks, a PCP device SHOULD generate state
   information as little as possible in the initial PA-Request and PA-
   Answer exchanges.  The choice of EAP method is also very important.
   The selected EAP method must be resilient to the attacks possibly
