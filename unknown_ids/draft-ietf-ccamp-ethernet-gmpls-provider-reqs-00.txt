Abstract

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is applicable to
   Ethernet switches supporting Provider Backbone Bridge Traffic 
   Engineering (PBB-TE) networks. The GMPLS controlled Ethernet label
   switch network not only automates creation of Ethernet Label Switched
   Paths(Eth-LSPs), it also provides sophisticated Eth-LSP recovery
   Mechanisms such as protection and restoration of an Eth-LSP. This
   document describes the requirements for the set of solutions of GMPLS
   controlled Ethernet label switch networks.

1.  Introduction

   Scalability and manageability of Ethernet switch networks has
   continuously improved, and the deployment of Ethernet switches
   supporting Provider Bridging (PB) [IEEE802.1ad] has became one of the
   solutions for service providers to provide enterprise WAN/LAN services.
   IEEE standardization activities of Provider Backbone Bridge(PBB)
   [IEEE 802.1ah] and PBB for Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE) [IEEE802.1Qay]
   provide an opportunity not only for enhancing the scalability,
   manageability, and controllability of the Ethernet service networks,
   but also for more efficiently deploying access/metro access networks.

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) provides the 
   framework for handling and controlling various types of switching
   technologies, namely packet switching with various label formats TDM
   switching, and wavelength switching [RFC3945]. Therefore, the combined
   use of GMPLS and PBB-TE is a fairly suitable "use case" that
   contributes to enhancing the flexibility of Ethernet Label Switched
   Path (Eth-LSP) over Ethernet switch networks without defining
   additional connection layers.

   This document describes requirements for GMPLS protocols to control
   Ethernet label switch networks and comprises mainly two parts.
   The first one is the requirements for GMPLS extension for
   controlling Ethernet layer. The second one includes the requirements
   for GMPLS extensions to support multi-layer operation. Although a
   large portion of requirements in the second scope coincides with the 
   description in [Interwk-fwk] and [Interwk-req], some of important
   requirements are also described in this document. 


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Reference model

3.1 Single Layer

   This document describes requirements based on the reference model
   depicted in Fig. 1. The first reference model is an intra-domain 
   and single layer GMPLS controlled Ethernet label switching network
   in which Eth-LSPs traverse over between Back Bone Core Bridges
   (BCBs) or Back Bone Edge Bridges (BEBs).

   The BEBs provide mainly three types of service interfaces, namely
   Port based service interface (P-based IF), S-tagged service interface
   (S-tagged IF), and I-tagged service Interface (I-tagged IF) 
   [IEEE802.1ah]. The "P-based IF" and "S-tagged IF" are connected to the
   I-component of a BEB (I-BEB), while the I-tagged IF is connected to 
   the B-component of a BEB (B-BEB). "S-tagged IF" can perform various
   types of mapping between Service VLAN ID (S-VID) and Backbone
   instance Service Identifier (I-SID). Here, S-VID is assigned within
   customer network domain or Provider Bridge (PB) domain. On the other
   hand, I-SID is defined between I-components of BEBs.


3.2 Multi-layer

   The second reference model is Ethernet and L1 (such as TDM, OTN,
   etc) multi-layer network. Each Ethernet switch node behaves as
   a border node between the Ethernet layer and optical Layers.
   Each BCB or BEB terminates Optical Label Switched Path (O-LSPs)
   with Ethernet encoding type and some O-LSPs dynamically form LAG.
   Thus, some Eth-LSPs traverse over multiple O-LSPs, while other
   Eth-LSPs traverse over single O-LSPs.

   Also, it is technically possible to form multiple layer Ethernet
   switch networks. Namely, the reference model is defined as the case 
   that Ethernet switch network substitutes L1 network in Fig.2, and
   realizes MAC in MAC Ethernet transport.
   The routing information of optical layer may be isolated (overlay
   model), shuffled (peer model), or virtualized with FA-LSPs
   (augmented model) for Ethernet switch layer.

4.  Requirements

   Section 4.1 to 4.6 describe requirements for single layer Ethernet
   label swicth network based on the reference model from Fig.1.
   In addition, section 4.7 describes requirements for multiple
   layer network with Ethernet layer and circuit switch layer (such as
   wavelength switched layer and so on). Finally, section 4.8 describes
   generic requirements applicable to single and multiple layer
   networks.


4.1 Control plane architecture and functionality

4.1.1 In-band control plane channel 

   The solution should be able to establish in-band control channel,
   while preserving the solution of out-band control channel. 
   The solution should include negotiation mechanism to specify bandwidth
   and priority of control-channel between peer Ethernet switches.

4.1.2 Neighbor discovery mechanism 

   The solution MUST be able to realize automatic neighbor discovery
   as realized in current PB or PBB networks.
   Namely, the solution MUST support an automatic negotiation mechanism
   to exchange information of Node ID, TE-Link ID, Data-link ID 
   (in the case of link Bundling), and IP address of the control channel.
   On the other hand, the extension should be minimized by making use 
   of [IEEE 802.1AB].


4.2 Ethernet LSP control

4.2.1 Prevention of Loops

   The solution should have reliability to prevent creating loops of 
   Eth-LSPs. Specifically if the solution supports numbered TE-Link 
   addressing, the solution should define a methodology and protocol
   extensions if needed to detect or prevent loops.


4.2.2 Service control

   The solution should control various types of service interfaces
   defined in [IEEE802.1ah]. The service types of Egress port
      1) Port based service interface
      2) S-tagged service interface
            a) one-to-one mapping of S-VIDs to I-SIDs
            b) bundled mapping of S-VIDs to I-SIDs
               such as many-to-one, all-to-one, transparent mapping


Providers             Expires December 2008                      [Page 5]

draft-ietf-ccamp-ethernet-gmpls-provider-reqs-00.txt          June  2008


	3) I-tagged service interface
   should be controllable in addition to assignment of Egress port
   itself.

   Also, the solution should be flexible to following operational 
   scenarios,
      1) Any change of mapping of S-VIDs to I-SIDs 
      2) Flexibility to nest or stitch higher layer Eth-LSPs.
      3) Any change of bandwidth of Eth-LSPs. Here, the solution 
         of bandwidth modification scenario may include bundling
         of multiple Eth-LSPs.


4.2.3 P2MP and MP2MP requirements 

   Detail requirements will be described in future version.


4.3 OA&M related functionality

   OAM mechanisms must be defined for GMPLS controlled E-LSPs.
   Since the data plane is still Ethernet based, the mechanisms
   should capitalize on existing IEEE802.1ad and Y.1731 mechanisms.

   Also, the solution should provide admin status control mechanism 
   to coordinate with Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) 
   functionality [IEEE802.1ag].


4.4 Protection and Restoration related functionality

   Detail requirements will be described in future version.


4.5 Link Aggregation Group (LAG) related functionality

   Link Aggregation is beneficial functionality to realize reliable
   Ethernet label switched networks. The availability of connection
   between peer Ethernet switches can be enhanced in the case of 
   single link failure, if member links of the LAG are diversely
   routed. In this operational scenario, LAG provides for link protection
   functionality.

   The solution should include methodology to explicitly assign 
   the links forming LAG a desired link type (which is similar sense to 
   assign link protection type described in [RFC3471]).

4.5.1 Failure or deletion of LAG member link

   The solution should include functionality to prioritize Eth-LSPs,
   specifically when total bandwidth of Eth-LSPs exceeds total bandwidth

Providers             Expires December 2008                      [Page 6]

draft-ietf-ccamp-ethernet-gmpls-provider-reqs-00.txt          June  2008

   of healthy LAG members after the failure of one or more LAG member
   links.

   The solution should provide for rerouting an Eth-LSP setup over a
   failed member link in a LAG to another member link in the LAG. 

4.5.2 Recovery or addition of LAG member link

   The solution should include functionality to re-optimize Eth-LSP
   paths after the addition of a LAG member link, i.e. reversion of
   failed Eth-LSPs after the failure of the LAG member link, or
   reallocation of other Eth-LSPs traversing congested Links after
   the addition of LAG member link. 


4.6 Inter-domain Ethernet LSP

   The solution should take into account possible future extension
   to control inter-domain Eth-LSPs. Here, the possible extensions are 
   Eth-LSPs traverse over
   	1) I-tagged service interfaces
2) S-tagged service interfaces, and
3) C-tagged service interfaces.


4.7 Multi-layer network 

4.7.1 Dynamic formation of LAG

    The solution should include dynamic formation of a LAG after the
    creation or deletion of optical LSPs which interconnect ports of 
    Ethernet switches.

4.7.2 Other requirements

   The architecture and requirements for MPLS-GMPLS inter-working are 
   described in [Interwk-fwk] and [Interwk-req]. Some of the requirements
   described in [Interwk-req] are valid even for the case of GMPLS-GMPLS
   interworking between Ethernet label switched network and L1 network.
   In other words,
     1) End-to-End signaling of Eth-LSPs
     2) Triggered establishment of L1 LSPs
     3) Avoiding complexity and risks.
   should be satisfied even for GMPLS control plane for Ethernet. For
   more details, see [Interwk-req] and MPLS-TE client network written
   in the document should be understood as Ethernet client network.

   Regarding to routing issue, 
     1) Advertisement of Ethernet label switch network information
        via L1 GMPLS networks
     2) Selective Advertisement of Ethernet label switched network
        information via a Border node

Providers             Expires December 2008                      [Page 7]

draft-ietf-ccamp-ethernet-gmpls-provider-reqs-00.txt          June  2008


   should be satisfied even in the case of GMPLS-GMPLS inter-working.
   Note that there is significant difference between MPLS-TE and GMPLS
   controlled Ethernet from the view point of methodology to create
   control channel.


4.8 Scalability

   The solution MUST be designed to scale according to following metrics. 
     - Number of nodes
     - Number of TE-Links
     - Number of LSPs
     - Number of service ports
     - Number of bundled S-VLANs mapped to I-SID and Eth-LSPs.
