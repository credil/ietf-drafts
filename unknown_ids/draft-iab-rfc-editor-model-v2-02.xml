	The RFC Editor performs a number of functions that may be
	carried out by various persons or entities. The RFC Editor
	model described in this document divides the responsibilities
	for the RFC Series into three functions: The RFC Series Editor,
	the RFC Production Center,
	and the RFC Publisher.  The function of the Independent
Submission Editor is also defined here.  The Internet Architecture Board 
(IAB) oversight by way of
delegation to the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC) is described,
as is the relationship between the IETF Administrative Oversight
Committee (IAOC) and the RSOC.
This document reflects 1 year of
        experience with RFC Editor Model version 1.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community, is
	concerned with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series,
	orderly RFC Editor succession, maintaining RFC quality, and
	RFC document accessibility. The IAB is also sensitive to the
	concerns of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
	about providing the necessary services in a cost effective and
	efficient manner.
      </t>
      <t>
	The definition of the RFC series is described in RFC 4844
	<xref target="RFC4844"/>. Section 3.1 defines "RFC Editor":
      </t>
      <t>
        <figure>
	<artwork>
     Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of the RFC
     Series (the RFC Editor). The task has grown, and the work now
     requires the organized activity of several experts, so there are
     RFC Editors, or an RFC Editor organization. In time, there may be
     multiple organizations working together to undertake the work
     required by the RFC Series. For simplicity's sake, and without
     attempting to predict how the role might be subdivided among them,
     this document refers to this collection of experts and 
     organizations as the "RFC Editor".

     The RFC Editor is an expert technical editor and series editor,
     acting to support the mission of the RFC Series. As such, the RFC
     Editor is the implementer handling the editorial management of the
     RFC Series, in accordance with the defined processes. In addition,
     the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime mover in
     discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and archiving
     RFCs.
	</artwork>
        </figure>
      </t>
      <t>
	RFC 4844 makes no attempt to explore the internal organization
	of the RFC Editor. However, RFC 4844 envisions changes in the
	RFC Editor organizational structure. In discussion with the
	Internet community, the IAB considered changes that increase
	flexibility and operational support options, provides for the
	orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensures the
	continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC quality,
	maintaining timely processing, ensuring document
	accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing cost
	transparency. The model set forth below is the result of those
	discussions and the experience gained since, as described
immediately below, and examines the internal organization of 
	the RFC Editor, while remaining consistent with RFC 4844.
        This version of the document also reflects the discussions, as
described below, that have occurred since the first efforts to clarify
that internal organization.
      </t>
      <t>
	Note that RFC 4844 uses the term "RFC Editor function" or "RFC
	Editor" as the collective set of responsibilities for which
	this memo provides a model for internal organization. This
	memo defines the term "RFC Series Editor" or "Series
	Editor" for one of the organizational components.
      </t>
      <t>
   The RFC Editor model was first approved in October 1, 2008 and has 
   evolved since. During the implementation of version 1 of the model
   <xref target="RFC5620"/> it was quickly realized that
the role of the RSE and the  
   oversight responsibilities needed to be structured differently. In
   order to gain experience with 'running code' a transitional RFC Series
   Editor was hired who analyzed the managerial environment and provided
   recommendations. This version of the model is based on his recommendations
   and the subsequent discussion on the rfc-interest list. 
      </t>
      <t>
   The document, and the resulting structures,
   will be modified as needed through normal procedures.  The RSE, and
the IAB, through the RFC oversight committee (see <xref target="RSOC"/>), will
continue to monitor discussions  
   within the community about potential
   adjustments to the RFC Editor model and recognizes that the process
   described in this document may need to be adjusted to align with any
   changes that result from such discussions, hence the version number
   in the title.
      </t>
   <t>
   The IAB and IAOC maintain their chartered
	responsibility as defined in <xref target="RFC2850"/> and
        <xref target="RFC4071"/>. 
   </t>

      <t>
	In this model documents are produced and approved through
	multiple document streams.  The stream manager for each stream
        is responsible for the content of that stream.  
        The four streams that now exist are described in [RFC4844]. 
        The RFC Editor function is responsible for the packaging and
        distribution of the documents.  As such,  documents from these
        streams are 
	edited and processed by the Production Center and published by
	the Publisher.  The RFC Series Editor will exercise
	executive management over the activities of the
	RFC Publisher and the RFC Production Center (which can be seen
	as back office functions) and will be the entity that:
      </t>
      <t>
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>Provides Executive Management for the overall operation
of the RFC Editor, including the Production and Publication components.</t>
	  <t>Represents the RFC Series and the RFC Editor Function
within the IETF and externally.</t>
	  <t>Is responsible for planning and seeing to the execution
of improvements in the RFC Editor Production and Access Processes.</t>
	  <t>Leads the community in the development of improvements to
the RFC Series.</t>
          <t> Is responsible for the content of the rfc-editor.org web
site, which is operated and maintained by the RFC Publisher.</t>
      <t>The RSE will develop consensus versions of vision and policy
      documents which will be approved by the RFC Series Oversight
      Committee (<xref target="RSOC"/>).</t>
	</list>
      </t>
      <t>These responsibilities are defined below, although the
specific work items under them are a matter for the actual employment
contract and its Statement of Work.</t>
      <t>
	The IAB and IAOC maintain their chartered
	responsibility as defined in <xref target="RFC2850"/> and
        <xref target="RFC4071"/>.  More details on the
        oversight by the IAB via the RFC Series Oversight Committee 
        (RSOC) can be found in <xref target="RSOC"/>.  For example,
	the RSE does not have the direct authority to 
        hire or fire RFC Editor
	contractors or personnel. 
      </t>
      
      
      <section anchor="RSE" title="RFC Series Editor">
	<t>
	  The RFC Series Editor is the individual with overall
responsibility 
for the quality, continuity, and evolution of the RFC Series.  
        </t>

	<t>The RSE is appointed by the IAB, but formally hired by the 
        IAOC. The IAB delegates the direct oversight over the RSE to the
        RSOC, which it appoints.</t>
	
       <t>The RSE is expected to cooperate closely with the IAOC and
the stream managers.</t>

        <section anchor="ExecManage" title="Executive Management of
the Publication and Production Functions">
        <t> With respect to the Publication and Production functions, the RSE
      provides input to the IASA budget, statements of work, and manages
      vendor selection processes.  The RSE performs annual reviews of
      the Production and Publication function which are then provided to
      the RSOC and the IASA.</t>

      <t>The RSE is responsible for the performance of the Production
Center and Publisher.  The RSE is responsible for issues that go
beyond the production or publication functions, such as cross-stream
coordination of priorities.  Issues that require changes to the budget
or contracts shall be brought to the IAD by the RSE.</t>

      <t>The RSE is also responsible for creating documentation and 
      structures that will allow for the RFC
      Series' continuity in the face of changes in contracts and
personnel. </t>

      <t>Vendor selection for these functions  is done in cooperation
with the streams and under final authority of the IASA.  Details on
this process can be found in <xref target="vendorsel"/>.</t>

        <section anchor="SeriesRep" title="Representation of the RFC
Series">
        <t>The RSE is the primary representative of the RFC Series.
This representation is important both internally, relative to the
IETF, and externally.</t>
        <section anchor="IETFRep" title="Representation to the IETF">
        <t>The RSE is the primary point of contact to the IETF on
matters other than the practicalities of producing individual RFCs
(which are worked with the RFC Production Center staff.)</t>

        <t>This includes providing suitable reports to the community
at large; providing email contact for policy questions and inputs; and
enabling and participating in suitable on-line forums for discussion
of issues related to the RFC Series.</t>

        <t>Due to the history and nature of the interaction between
the RSE and the IETF, certain principles must be understood and
adhered to by the RSE in his or her interactions with the community.  These
apply to the representation function, as well as to the leadership the
RSE provides in Production and Series Development.</t>

        <section title="Volunteerism">
           <t>The vast majority of Internet technical community work
is led, initiated, and done by community volunteers, including
oversight, policy-making, and direct production of, for example, many
software tools.  The Series Editor role relies on volunteer
participation and needs to support the vitality and effectiveness of
volunteer participation.</t>

        <section title="Policy Authority">
          <t>All decisions are to be made in the overall interest of
the Internet community. The IETF community is the arbiter of policy.
The RSE must consult with the IETF community on policy issues.  
The RSE works with the IETF community to achieve policy that meets
the overall quality, continuity, and evolution goals the RSE is
charged with meeting.  As
described below in <xref target="RSOC"/> the RSE reports the results
of such interactions to the RSOC, including the specific
recommendations on policy.  This enables the RSOC to provide the
oversight the IAB is required to apply, as well as to confirm that the
IETF community has been properly consulted and considered in making policy.

the IETF need a contact person to talk to about the RFC Series.  The
RSE is that individual.</t>

        <t>Over time, the RSE should determine what if any means
should be employed to increase end-user awareness of the series, and
to reinforce the stature of the Series, and will be the contact point
for outside parties seeking information on the Series or the

          <t>Closely related to providing executive management to the
RFC Production and Publication functions is the need to develop and

   <list style="hanging">
      <t>The RSE is responsible for the coordination of discussion on
      Series evolution among the Series' Stream participants and the

 for the RFC Series, including examining:
         <list style="hanging">
         <t>the technical specification series, as it continues to
         evolve.  The RSE is expected to take a broad view and be
         looking for the best ways to evolve the series for the
         benefit of the entire Internet Community.  As such, the
         RSE may even consider evolution 
         beyond the historical 'by engineers for engineers' emphasis;
         and</t>

         <t>its publication-technical environment: looking
         at whether it should be slowly changing in terms
         of publication and archiving techniques; particularly
         to better serve the communities that
         produce and depend on the RFC Series.  For example, all of 
         those communities
         have been slowly changing to include significant multi-lingual
         and non-native-English populations.  Another example is that
         some of these constituencies also have a
         shifted to include significant groups of members whose primary
         focus is on the constraints and consequences of network
         engineering, rather than a primary interest in the engineering
         issues themselves.</t>

	</t>
	<t>
	  <list style="numbers">
	    <t>Maintaining technical quality of the Independent Submission stream.</t>
	    <t>Reviewing, approving, and processing Independent Submissions.</t>
	    <t>Forwarding draft RFCs in the Independent Submission Stream to the RFC Production Center.</t>
	    <t>Reviewing and approving Independent Submissions RFC errata.</t>
	    <t>Coordinating work and conforming to general RFC Series
	    policies as specified by the IAB and RSE.</t>
	    <t> Providing statistics and documentation as requested by the RSE and/or IAOC.</t>
	  </list>
	</t>

	<t>
	  The Independent Submission Editor is a senior position for
	  which the following qualifications are desired:
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list style="numbers">
	    <t>Technical competence, i.e., broad technical experience
	    and perspective across the whole range of Internet
	    technologies and applications, and specifically, the
	    ability to work effectively with portions of that spectrum
	    in which no personal expertise exists.</t>
	    <t>Thorough familiarity with the RFC series.</t>
	    <t>An ability to define and constitute advisory and
	    document review arrangements.  If those arrangements
	    include an Editorial Board similar to the current one or
	    some equivalent arrangement, assess the technical
	    competence of potential Editorial Board members. </t>
	    <t>Good standing in the technical community, in and beyond
	    the IETF.</t>
	    <t> Demonstrated editorial skills, good command of the
	    English language, and demonstrated history of being able
	    to work effectively with technical documents and materials
	    created by others.</t>
	    <t>The ability to work effectively in a multi-actor
	    environment with divided authority and responsibility
	    similar to that described in this document.
	    </t>
	  </list>

	  The Independent Submission Editor may seek support from an
	  advisory board (see <xref target="editorial_board"/>) and
	  may form a team to perform the activities needed to fulfill
	  their responsibilities.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The individual with the listed qualifications will be
	  selected by the IAB after input is collected from the
	  community. An approach similar to the one used by the IAB
	  to select an IAOC member every other year as described in
	  <xref target="RFC4333"/> should be used. While the ISE
	  itself is considered a volunteer function, the IAB considers
	  maintaining the Independent Submission stream 
	  part of the IAB's supported activities, and will include the
	  expenses made for the support of the ISE in its
	  IASA-supported budget.

    <t>The IAB is responsible for oversight over the RFC Series and
    acts as a body for appeal and conflict resolution.</t>

    <t>In order to provide continuity over periods longer than the nomcom
    appointment cycle and assure that oversight is informed through
    subject matter experts the IAB will establish a group that implements
    oversight for the IAB, the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC).</t>

    <t>The RSOC will act with authority delegated from the IAB: In general
    it will be the RSOC that will approve consensus policy and vision
    documents as developed by the RSE in collaboration with the
    community.  While it is expected that the IAB will exercise due
    diligence in its supervision of the RSOC,  the RSOC should be
    allowed the latitude to do its job without undue interference
    from the IAB.  Therefore, it is expected that the IAB
    will accord RSOC reports and recommendations the benefit of
    the doubt.</t>

   <t>In those general cases the IAB is ultimately responsible for
   oversight and acts as a body for appeal and resolution.</t>

   <t>For all aspects that affect the RSE itself (e.g. hiring and firing)
   the RSOC prepares recommendations for the IAB but final decision is
   the responsibility of the IAB.  For instance the RSOC would:

   <list style="symbols">
     <t>perform annual reviews of the RSE and reports to the IAB.</t>

     <t> manage RSE candidate selection and advises the IAB on candidate
      appointment (in other words select the RSE, subject to IAB
      approval)</t>
   </list>
   </t>

   <t>RSOC members are expected to recognize potential conflicts of
interest and behave accordingly.</t>

   <t>RSOC will also work with the IASA, proposing a budget, and the
   remuneration and employment agreement of the RSE position.
   </t>

   <t>The RSOC will be responsible to ensure that the RFC Series is run in
   a transparent and accountable manner.</t>

   <t>The RSOC shall develop and publish its own rules of order.</t>

   <t>One of the first responsibilities of the RSOC will be to define
in detail the solicitation and selection process for the next RSE.
The RSOC is expected to document to the community the process it
selects.  Upon completion of the  selection, the RSOC should determine
the best way to preserve this information for future use.
    </t>

   <section anchor="RSOCCompose" title="RSOC Composition">

   <t>
   The RSOC will operate under the authority of the IAB, with the IAB 
   retaining final responsibility.  The IAB will delegate authority and
   responsibility to the RSOC as appropriate and as RSOC and RSE
   relationships evolve.  The RSOC will include people who are not
   current IAB members.  Currently, this is aligned with the IAB
   Program structure.   The IAB will designate the
   membership of the RSOC with the goals of preserving effective
   stability, keeping it small enough to be effective, but large enough
   to provide general Internet Community expertise, specific IETF
   expertise, Publication expertise, and stream expertise.  Members
   serve at the pleasure of the IAB and are expected to bring a balance
   between short and long term perspective.  Specific input about, and
   recommendations of, members will be sought from the streams, the
   IASA, and the RSE.</t>

   <t>The IAOC will appoint an individual to serve as its Liaison to
   the RSOC.  The RSE and this Liaison will serve as
   non-voting ex-officio members of the RSOC.  Either or both can be
   excluded from its discussions if necessary.</t>

      <t>The RSE owns and develops the work definition (the SOW) and
      participates in the IASA Vendor selection process.
      The work definition is created within the IASA budget and
      takes into account the stream managers and community input.</t>

      <t>The process to select and contract for an RFC Production

          <t>The Selection Committee selects the vendor, subject to
the successful negotiation of a contract approved by the IAOC.  In the
event that a contract cannot be reached, the matter shall be referred
to the Selection Committee for further action.</t>
          <t>The Selection Committee may select an RFC Publisher
either through the IASA RFP process, or, at the Committee's option,
the Committee may select the IETF Secretariat to provide RFC Publisher

      <section title="Budget">

	  The expenses discussed in this document are not new
	  expenses.  They have been and remain part of the 
          IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA, 
          <xref target="RFC4071"/>) budget. 
	</t>
        <t>The RFC Series portion of the IASA Budget shall include
entries for the RSOC, RSE, RFC Production Center, and the RFC
Publisher.  The IASA Budget shall also include entries for the
streams, including the independent stream.</t>
         <t>The IAOC has the responsibility to approve the total RFC
Editor budget (and the authority to deny it.)  The RSE must work
within the IAOC budgetary process.</t>
         <t>The RSE is responsible for managing the RFC Editor to
operate within those budgets.  If product needs change, the RSE is
responsible for working with the Production Center to determine what
the correct response should be.  If they agree that a budgetary change
is needed, that needs to be taken to the IAD and the IAOC.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="dispute" title="Disagreements Among RFC Editor Entities">

	<t>
	  If during the execution of their activities, a disagreement
	  arises over an implementation decision made by one of the
	  entities in the model, any relevant party should first
	  request a review and reconsideration of the decision.  If
	  that party still disagrees after the reconsideration, that
	  party may ask the RSE to decide or, especially if the RSE is
	  involved, that party may ask the IAB Chair (for a technical
	  or procedural matter) to mediate or appoint a mediator to aid in
	  the discussions, although not is obligated to do so.
	  All parties should work informally and in good faith to
	  reach a mutually agreeable conclusion.
	</t>

	<t>
	  If such a conclusion is not possible through those informal
	  processes, then the matter must be registered with the RFC
	  Series Oversight Committee. The RSOC may choose to offer advice
	  to the RSE or more general advice to the parties involved
	  and may ask the RSE to defer a decision until it formulates
	  its advice. However, if a timely decision cannot be reached
	  through discussion, mediation, and mutual agreement, the
	  Series Editor is expected to make whatever decisions are
	  needed to ensure the smooth functioning of the RFC Editor
	  function; those decisions are final.
	</t>

	<t>
	  RSE decisions of this type are limited to the functioning of
	  the process and evaluation of whether current policies are
	  appropriately implemented in the decision or need
	  adjustment. In particular, it should be noted that final
	  decisions about the technical content of individual
	  documents are the exclusive responsibility of the stream
	  approvers for those documents, as shown in the illustration
	  in <xref target="model-figure"/>.
	</t>

	<t>
	  If informal agreements cannot be reached, then formal RSOC
	  review and decision making may be required.  If so, the
	  the RSE must identify the issues involved to the community,
          so that the community is aware of the situation.  The RSE
          will the report the issue to the RSOC for formal resolution
          by the RSOC with confirmation by the IAB in its oversight
          capacity.
	</t>
	<t>
	  IAB and community discussion of any patterns of disputes are
	  expected to inform future changes to Series policies
	  including possible updates to this document.
	</t>
	</section>

        <section title="Issues with Contractual Impact"> 
	<t>
	  If a disagreement or decision has immediate or future
	  contractual consequences it falls under BCP 101 and IASA, 
          and thus the Series Editor must identify
	  the issue and provide his or her advice to the IAOC and, 
          if the RSOC has provided advice,
	  forward that advice as well. After the IAOC has notified the
	  IAB, the IAD, as guided by the IAOC, has the responsibility
          to resolve these contractual issues under applicable
          procedures in BCP 101 and such appropriate contracts.
	</t>
        </section>
  </section>
  
  <section title="IANA considerations">
    <t>
      This document defines several functions within the overall
      RFC  Editor structure, and it places the responsibility for
      coordination of registry value assignments with the RFC
      Production Center. The IAOC will facilitate the establishment
      of the relationship between the RFC Production Center and IANA.
    </t>
    <t>
      This document does not create a new registry nor does it
      register any values in existing registries, and no IANA action
      is required.
    </t>

  </section>
  <section title="Security considerations">
    <t>
      The same security considerations as those in RFC 4844 apply. The
      processes for the publication of documents must prevent the
      introduction of unapproved changes. Since the RFC Editor
      maintains the index of publications, sufficient security must be
      in place to prevent these published documents from being changed
      by external parties. The archive of RFC documents, any source
      documents needed to recreate the RFC documents, and any
      associated original documents (such as lists of errata, tools,
      and, for some early items, non-machine readable originals) need
      to be secured against failure of the storage medium and other
      similar disasters.
    </t>
    <t>
     The IAOC should take these security considerations into
     account during the implementation and enforcement of the RFC
     Editor model contracts.

	<t>Added Sandy and Alice to the acknowledgment section, they were accidentally omitted</t>

	<t>
	  Added text so that the selection

	  documents the use of an advisory committee and is explicit
	  about the fact that the community expands beyond the IETF
	  community. 

	</t>
	<t>
	  Modified the RFC Editor Function name to "RFC Series Editor"
	  in order to minimize confusion between the collective of
	  functions (RFC Editor) and the function (Series Editor).
	</t>
	<t>
	  Added wording for specifying the technical competence needed
	  by the indep.subm.editor as suggested by JCK

	   Clarified that the Independent Submission Stream Editors budget is
	   independent from the IETF/IASA.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Improved the language that clarified that the RFC Series
	  editors and Independent Submission Stream editor do not necessarily
	  need to work  without assistants, while they bear the responsibility.

	<t>Added editorial skill and command of English as a requirement for the ISE</t>
