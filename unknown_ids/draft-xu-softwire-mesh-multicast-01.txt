Abstract

   The Internet will need to support IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  Both
   address families and their attendent protocol suites support
   multicast of the single-source and any-source varieties.  As part of
   the transition to IPv6, there will be scenarios where a backbone
   network running one IP address family internally (referred to as
   internal IP or I-IP) will provide transit services to attached client
   networks running another IP address family (referred to as external
   IP or E-IP).  It is expected that the I-IP backbone will offer
   unicast and multicast transit services to the client E-IP networks.

   Softwires Mesh is a solution for supporting E-IP unicast and
   multicast across an I-IP backbone.  This document describes the
   mechanisms for suppporting Internet-style multicast across a set of
   E-IP and I-IP networks supporting softwires mesh.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet will need to support IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  Both
   address families and their attendent protocol suites support
   multicast of the single-source and any-source varieties.  As part of
   the transition to IPv6, there will be scenarios where a backbone
   network running one IP address family internally (referred to as
   internal IP or I-IP) will provide transit services to attached client
   networks running another IP address family (referred to as external
   IP or E-IP).

   The preferred solution is to leverage the multicast functions,
   inherent in the I-IP backbone, to efficiently and scalably tunnel
   encapsulated client E-IP multicast packets inside an I-IP core tree
   rooted at one or more ingress AFBR nodes and branching out to one or
   more egress AFBR leaf nodes.

   [6] outlines the requirements for the softwires mesh scenario
   including multicast.  It is straightforward to envisage that client
   E-IP multicast sources and receivers will reside in different client
   E-IP networks connected to an I-IP backbone network.  This requires
   that the client E-IP source-rooted or shared tree will need to
   traverse the I-IP backbone network.

   One method to accomplish this is to re-use the multicast VPN approach
   outlined in [10].  MVPN-like schemes can support the softwire mesh
   scenario and achieve a "many-to-one" mapping between the E-IP client
   multicast trees and transit core multicast trees.  The advantage of
   this approach is that the number of trees in the I-IP backbone
   network scales less than linearly with the number of E-IP client
   trees.  Corporate enterprise networks and by extension multicast VPNs
   have been known to run applications that create a large amount of
   (S,G) states.  Aggregation at the edge contains the (S,G) states that
   need to be maintained by the network operator supporting the customer
   VPNs.  The disadvantage of this approach is possible inefficient
   bandwidth and resource utilization if multicast packets are delivered
   to a receiver AFBR with no attached E-IP receiver.

   Internet-style multicast is a somewhat different in that the trees
   tends to be relatively sparse and source-rooted.  The need for
   multicast aggregation at the edge (where many customer multicast
   trees are mapped into a few or one backbone multicast trees) does not
   exist and to date has not been identified.  Thus the need for a basic
   or closer alignment with E-IP and I-IP multicast procedures emerges.

   A framework on how to support such methods is discribed in [8].  In
   this document, a more detailed discussion supporting the "one-to-one"
   mapping schemes for the IPv6 over IPv4 and IPv4 over IPv6 scenarios

2.  Terminology

   An example of a softwire mesh network supporting multicast is
   illustrated in Figure 1.  A multicast source S is located in one E-IP
   client network, while candidate E-IP group receivers are located in
   the same or different E-IP client networks that all share a common
   I-IP transit network.  When E-IP sources and receivers are not local
   to each other, they can only communicate with each other through the
   I-IP core.  There may be several E-IP sources for some multicast
   group residing in different client E-IP networks.  In the case of
   shared trees, the E-IP sources, receivers and RPs might be located in
   different client E-IP networks.  In the simple case the resources of
   the I-IP core are managed by a single operator although the inter-
   provider case is not precluded.

   E-IP and I-IP control planes to maintain E-IP and I-IP multicast
   state respectively and performs the appropriate encapsulation/
   decapsulation client E-IP multicast packets for transport across the
   I-IP core.  An AFBR will can act as a source and/or receiver in an
   I-IP multicast tree.

   o Upstream AFBR: The AFBR routers that are located at the upstream of
   multicast data flow.

   o Downstream AFBR: The AFBR routers that are located at the
   downstream of multicast data flow.

   o I-IP (Internal IP).  This refers to the form of IP (i.e., either
   IPv4 or IPv6) that is supported by the transit (or backbone) network.

   o E-IP (External IP) This refers to the form of IP (i.e. either IPv4
   or IPv6) that is supported by the client network(s) attached to the
   I-IP transit core.  An E-IPv6 client network runs IPv6 and an E-IPv4
   client network runs IPv4.

   o I-IP core tree.  A single-source or multi-source distribution tree
   rooted at one or more AFBR source nodes and branching out to one or
   more AFBR leaf nodes.  An I-IP core Tree is built using standard IP
   or MPLS multicast signaling protocols operating exclusively inside
   the I-IP core network.  An I-IP core Tree is used to tunnel E-IP
   multicast packets belonging to E-IP trees across the I-IP core.
   Another name for an I-IP core Tree is multicast or multipoint
   softwire.  An I-IPv6 core network runs IPv6 and an I-IPv4 core
   network runs IPv4.

   o E-IP client tree.  A single-source or multi-source distribution
   tree rooted at one or more hosts or routers located inside a client
   E-IP network and branching out to one or more leaf nodes located in
   the same or different client E-IP networks.

   Figure 2: IPv6-over-IPv4 Scenario

   In this scenario, the E-IP Client Networks run IPv6 while the I-IP
   core runs IPv4 and is illustrated in Figure 2.

   IPv6 multicast group addresses are longer than IPv4 multicast group
   addresses.  It will not be possible to perform an algorithmic IPv6 -
   to - IPv4 address mapping without the risk of multiple IPv6 group
   addresses mapped to the same IPv4 address resulting in unnecessary
   bandwidth and resource consumption.  Therefore additional effort in
   the form of inter-AFBR signaling will be required to ensure client
   E-IPv6 multicast packets are injected into the correct I-IPv4
   multicast trees at the AFBRs.  This clear mismatch in IPv6 and IPv4
   group address lengths means that it will not be possible to perform a
   "one to one" mapping between IPv6 and IPv4 group addresses unless the

   IPv6 group address is scoped.

   As mentioned earlier this scenario is common the MVPN environment.
   As native IPv6 deployments and multicast applications emerge from the
   outer reaches of the greater public IPv4 Internet, it is envisaged
   that the IPv6 over IPv4 softwires mesh multicast scenario will be a
   necessary feature supported by networks operators.

   Figure 3: IPv4-over-IPv6 Scenario

   In this scenario, the E-IP client networks run IPv4 and I-IP core
   runs IPv6.  This scenario is illustrated in Figure 3.

   Because of the much larger IPv6 group address space, it will not be a
   problem to map individual client E-IPv4 trees to a specific I-IPv6
   core tree.  This simplifies operations on the AFBR because it becomes
   possible to algorithmically map an IPv4 group/source address to an
   IPv6 group/source address and vice-versa.

   The IPv4-over-IPv6 scenario is an emerging requirement as network

   operators build out native IPv6 backbone networks.  These networks
   naturally will support native IPv6 services and applications but it
   is with near 100% certainty that legacy IPv4 networks handling
   unicast and multicast will need to be accomodated.

4.  IPv4-over-IPv6

4.1.  Mechanism

   Routers in the client E-IPv4 networks contain routes to all other
   client E-IPv4 networks.  Through the set of known and deployed
   mechanisms, E-IPv4 hosts and routers have discovered or learned of
   (S,G) or (*,G) IPv4 addresses.  Any I-IP multicast state instantiated
   in the core is referred to as (S',G') or (*,G') and is of course
   separate from E-IP multicast state.

   Suppose a downstream AFBR D receives an E-IPv4 PIM Join/Prune message
   from the E-IPv4 network for either an (S,G) tree or a (*,G) tree.
   The AFBR D router can translate the E-IPv4 PIM message into an I-IPv6
   PIM message with the latter being directed towards I-IP IPv6 address
   of the upstream AFBR.  When the I-IPv6 PIM message arrives at the
   upstream AFBR A, it should translate the message back into an E-IPv4
   PIM message.  The result of these actions is the construction of
   E-IPv4 tree with (S,G) or (*,G) state deposited in the E-IP networks
   and an I-IP trees with (S',G') or (*,G') contained in the I-IP
   network.

   In this case it is incumbent upon the AFBR routers to perform PIM
   signaling message conversions in the control plane and IP group
   address conversions or mappings in the data plane.  It becomes
   possible to devise an algorithmic IPv4-to-IPv6 group mapping at AFBR.
   AFBR A can translate the IPv4 source address S into the corresponding
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 address, and then D can translate it back.  A
   proposed group address mapping is described in the next section.

   Note that the I-IPv6 core routers do not contain E-IPv4 routes.  To
   ensure that PIMv6 join messages can reach the correct AFBR router
   leading to E-IPv4 source network, the RPF Vector [7] is appended to
   the PIMv6 message on its ways to the AFBR.

4.2.  Group Address Mapping

   For IPv4-over-IPv6 scenario, an simple algorithmic mapping between
   IPv4 multicast group addresses and IPv6 group addresses is supported.
   One possibility is to prepend the operator's IPv6 prefix to the IPv4
   address when mapping an E-IP address to an I-IP address, just like
   figure 8 shows.

   network operator and the last 4 octets are the IPv4 address.

   Additional group address mapping options will be provided in the next
   version of this draft.

4.3.  Actions performed by AFBR

   The following actions are performed by the AFBR

   o  Process E-IPv4 PIM messages
      When a downstream AFBR receives an E-IPv4 PIM message , it should
      check the address family of the next-hop towards the destination.
      If the address family is IPv4, the AFBR should forward the message
      without any translation; otherwise it should follow the following
      operation.

   o  Perform E-IPv4 PIM to I-IPv6 PIM message conversion
      First, E-IPv4 PIM message with S(or *) and G is translated into
      I-IPv6 PIM message with S'(or *) and G'; Second, with MBGP, AFBRs
      knew the unicast address of upstream AFBR, thus RPF vector with
      unicast address of upstream AFBR is appended to the I-IPv6 PIM
      Join message.

   o  Transmit and receive I-IPv6 PIM messages
      The downstream AFBR sends the I-IPv6 PIM message to the upstream
      AFBR.  When the upstream AFBR receives this I-IPv4 PIM message, it
      checks the prefix of the multicast address and knows that the
      message is a translated message, then it removes the prefix
      (including the RPF vector) and sends the E-IPv4 PIM message
      towards upstream.

5.  IPv6-over-IPv4

5.1.  Discussion

   Routers in the client E-IPv6 networks contain routes to all other
   client E-IPv6 networks.  Through the set of known and deployed
   mechanisms, E-IPv6 hosts and routers have discovered or learned of
   (S,G) or (*,G) IPv6 addresses.  Any I-IP multicast state instantiated
   in the core is referred to as (S',G') or (*,G') and is of course
   separate from E-IP multicast state.

   This particular scenario introduces unique challenges.  Unlike the
   IPv4-over-IPv6 scenario, it's impossible to map all of the IPv6
   multicast address space into the IPv4 address space to address the
   one-to-one Softwire Multicast requirement.  There are however a
   number of approaches to either reduce the scope of the one-to-one
   requirement or to provide minimal aggregation as a compromise.  These
   can be explored in greater detail and articulated in future drafts
   for consideration of the Softwire Multicast solution by the working
   group.  Simple examples of these follow as discussion items for this
   work in progress.

5.2.  I-IP IPv4 Address Limitations

   We must first consider what range of I-IP IPv4 multicast addresses
   are available for the IPv6-over-IPv4 mapping.  If the I-IP provider
   is also using IPv4 multicast for other services then the entire 224/4
   address range will not be available.  Additionally, the 239/8 scoped
   range may also be used for other services limiting the available
   addresses for Softwire Multicast even further.  These limitations
   need to be addressed in any Softwire Mesh Multicast IPv6-over-IPv4
   solution.

5.3.  Source Address Mapping

   Source address S of E-IPv6 message will be mapped into S', which is
   the I-IPv4 address of upstream AFBR.

   With source address of I-IPv4 PIM message set to be S', routers in
   the backbone will transmit the message towards upstream AFBR, which
   will translate it back into E-IPv6 PIM message.

5.4.  E-IP IPv6 Addressing

   The multicast address range of E-IP IPv6 can be reduced in a number
   of ways to limit the scope of addresses that need to be mapped into
   the I-IP IPv4 space.  The IPv6 multicast address that's shared by
   both domain of IPv4 and IPv6 will be assigned with a fixed prefix,



Xu, et al.             Expires September 14, 2011              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          softwire mcast framework              March 2011


   The high order bits of the IPv6 address range will be fixed for
   mapping purposes.

   The document [12] provides a guideline for fixing the higher order
   bits of IPv6 address.  Part of the higher order bits will be in
   accordance with the previous RFCs(with one bit indicating it's an
   IPv4-Embedded IPv6 multicast address), and another part will be
   configurable according to local policies of the network manager.

   With this scheme, each IPv4 multicast address can be mapped into a
   unique IPv6 multicast address (with the assigned prefix), and each
   IPv6 multicast address with the assigned prefix can be mapped into a
   unique IPv4 multicast address.  Here, IPv4 multicast address act as
   the mulitcast flow identification(Flow_ID) that adapts to both IPv4
   and IPv6 domain.

5.5.  AFBR Signaling

   Due to the non-"one-to-one" mapping of E-IPv6 to I-IPv4 unicast
   address, upstream AFBR is unable to remapped the I-IPv4 source
   address to the original E-IPv6 source address(without any constraint
   like E-IP IPv6 addressing).  Thus we need a signal to inform the
   upstream AFBR the original E-IPv6 source address.

   One possible way to accomplish this is to use a tunnel to send the
   original E-IPv6 PIM message to the corresponding upstream AFBR.  For
   example, suppose that a downstream AFBR receives an E-IPv6 PIM
   Join(S,G) message and needs to forward it to the I-IP network, it
   should not only send the translated I-IPv4 PIM Join(S',G') into the
   I-IP network, but also encapsulate the original PIMv6 Join(S,G) and
   send it to the upstream AFBR.  When the upstream AFBR decapsulates a
   packet and finds a PIMv6 Join(S,G) message, it should process it as a
   normal PIMv6 message.  The synchronization of the original PIMv6
   message and the translated PIMv4 message that upstream AFBR receives
   will be included in the next version of this document.

5.6.  Actions performed by AFBR

   The following actions are performed by the AFBR

   o  Process E-IPv6 PIM messages
      When a downstream AFBR receives an E-IPv6 PIM message, it should
      check the address family of the upstream router.  If the address
      family is IPv6, the AFBR should not translate this message; If the
      address family is IPv4, it should process it as specified below.

   o  Perform E-IPv6 PIM to I-IPv4 PIM message conversion
      First, E-IPv6 PIM Join(S,G) messages are encapsulated and sent to



Xu, et al.             Expires September 14, 2011              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          softwire mcast framework              March 2011


      the upstream AFBR.  Second, the E-IPv6 PIM messages with S(or *)
      and G are translated into I-IPv4 PIM messages with S'(or *) and
      G'.  Third, translated I-IPv4 PIM Join(*,G') messages should be
      appended with RPF vector indicating the unicast address of
      upstream AFBR.  However, because multiple S may be mapped into the
      same S', not every E-IPv6 PIM messages will be translated into
      I-IPv4 PIM messages.  Suppose S1, S2 will be mapped into the same
      S', after translating Join(S1,G) into Join(S',G'), Join(S2,G) need
      not to be translated into Join(S',G').  When downstream AFBR has
      joined both (S1,G) and (S2,G), Prune(S',G') can only sent out when
      both (S1,G) and (S2,G) have no receivers.  The details of this
      part will be illustrated in the next version of this draft.

   o  Transmit and receive PIM messages
      The upstream AFBR will receive both encapsulated E-IPv6 PIM
      messages and translated I-IPv4 PIM messages.  Upon receiving
      encapsulated E-IPv6 PIM messages, the upstream AFBR decapsulates
      it and gets the original E-IPv6 PIM Join(S,G) messages; Upon
      receiving translated I-IPv4 PIM messages, the upstream AFBR just
      joins the multicast tree in the backbone.  Besides, when receiving
      PIM messages, the mapping relation should be established between
      (S,G)(or (*,G)) and (S',G')(or (*,G')).

6.  Summary

   There are two scenarios applicable to softwire mesh multicast: IPv4-
   over-IPv6 and IPv6-over-IPv4.  In the former senario, one-to-one
   group address mapping and PIM signaling conversion can be supported.

   The latter scenario introduces several challenges related to group
   address constraints and AFBR signaling.  Solutions are discussed.

7.  Security Considerations

   The AFBR routers could maintain secure communications through the use
   of Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol as described
   in[RFC4301].  But when adopting some schemes that will cause heavy
   burden on routers, some attacker may use it as a tool for DDoS
   attack.

8.  IANA Considerations

   For Inter-AFBR signaling, address mapping is applied, and it should
   follow some predefined rule, especially the format of IPv6 prefix for
   address mapping should be predefined, so that ingress AFBR and egress
   AFBR can finish the mapping procedure correctly.  The format of IPv6
   prefix for translation can be unified within only the transit core,
   or within global area.  In the later condition, the format should be
   assigned by IANA.
