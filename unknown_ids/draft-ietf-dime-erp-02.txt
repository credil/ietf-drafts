Abstract

   EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) defines extensions to the
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to support efficient re-
   authentication between the peer and an EAP Re-authentication (ER)
   server through a compatible authenticator.  This document specifies
   Diameter support for ERP.  It defines a new Diameter ERP application
   to transport ERP messages between ER authenticator and ER server, and
   a set of new AVPs that can be used to transport the cryptographic
   material needed by the re-authentication server.

Internet-Draft          Diameter support for ERP            October 2009


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5296] defines the EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP).  It
   consists in the following steps:

   1.  Bootstrapping: a root key for re-authentication is derived from
       the Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) created during EAP
       authentication [RFC5295].  This root key is transported from the
       EAP server to the ER server.

   2.  Re-authentication: a one-round-trip exchange between the peer and
       the ER server, resulting in mutual authentication.  To accomplish
       the EAP reauthentication functionality, ERP defines two new EAP
       codes - EAP-Initiate and EAP-Finish.

   This document defines how Diameter transports the ERP messages (Re-
   authentication step).  For this purpose, we define a new Application
   Id for ERP, and re-use the Diameter EAP commands (DER/DEA).

   This document also discusses the distribution of the root key
   (bootstrapping step), either during the initial EAP authentication
   (implicit bootstrapping) or during the first ERP exchange (explicit
   bootstrapping).  Security considerations for this key distribution
   are detailed in [RFC5295].

2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology defined in [RFC3748], [RFC5295],
   [RFC5296], and [RFC4072].

   "Root key" (RK) or "bootstrapping material" refer to the rRK or rDSRK
   derived from an EMSK, depending on the location of the ER server in
   home or foreign domain.

   We use the notation "ERP/DER" in this document to refer to a
   Diameter-EAP-Request command with its Application Id set to Diameter
   ERP application.  Similarly, we use the "ERP/DEA", "EAP/DER", and
   "EAP/DEA".

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Assumptions

   This document makes the following assumptions.

   The Home EAP server of a peer that wants to use ERP is extended to
   support:

      Cryptographic operations needed to derive the ERP root key from
      the EMSK.  By deriving the ERP root key for a specific domain, the
      home EAP server implicitly authorizes the use of ERP within this
      domain.

      Diameter operations needed to include this root key in a response
      message, when a request for this root key was received in a
      request message.  The two AVP that contain the request for and the
      root key material are defined in this document.

      (recommended) Ability to answer a DER message with EAP-Payload
      containing an explicit bootstrapping ERP message.

   The Authenticator (NAS) is extended to support:

      Allow the new ERP command codes (EAP-Initiate and EAP-Finish) in
      its EAP pass-through mode.

      (optional) Send the EAP-Initiate/Re-Auth-Start message

      (optional) Provide the local domain name via lower layer specific
      mechanism or via TLV in the EAP-Initiate/Re-Auth-Start message.

      Encapsulate ERP message and receive corresponding Diameter answer,
      as described in this document.

   If one of the components does not match these assumptions, the ERP
   mechanism will fail.  In such situation, a full EAP authentication
   may be attempted as a fallback mechanism.

   We consider at most one logical ER server entity in a domain.  If
   several physical servers are deployed for robustness, a replication
   mechanism must be deployed to synchronize the ERP states (root keys )
   between these servers.  This replication mechanism is out of the
   scope of this document.  If several ER servers are deployed in the
   domain, we assume that they can be used interchangeably.

4.  Protocol Overview

   The following figure shows the components involved in ERP, and their
   interactions.

                             explicit bootstraping scenario only.

                      Figure. Diameter ERP overview.

   The ER server is located either in the home domain (same as EAP
   server) or in the visited domain (same as authenticator, when it
   differs from the home domain).

   When the peer initiates an ERP exchange, the authenticator creates a
   Diameter-EAP-Request message, as described in Diameter EAP
   application [RFC4072].  The Application Id of the message is set to
   Diameter ERP application (code: TBD ) in the message.  The exact
   processing to generate the ERP/DER message is detailed in section
   Section 6.

   If there is an ER server in the same domain as the authenticator
   (local domain), Diameter routing MUST be configured so that this ERP/
   DER message reachs this server, even if the Destination-Realm is not
   the local domain.

   If there is no local ER server, the message is routed according to
   its Destination-Realm AVP content, extracted from the realm component
   of the keyName-NAI attribute.  As specified in [RFC5296], this realm
   is the home domain of the peer in case of bootstrapping exchange ('B'
   flag is set in ERP message) or the domain of the bootstrapped ER
   server otherwise .

   If no ER server is available in the home domain either, the ERP/DER
   message cannot be delivered, and an error DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER
   is generated as specified in [RFC3588] and returned to the
   authenticator.  The authenticator may cache this information (with
   limited duration) to avoid further attempts for ERP with this realm.
   It may also fallback to full EAP authentication to authenticate the
   peer.

   When an ER server receives the ERP/DER message, it searches its local
   database for a root key matching the keyName part of the User-Name
   AVP.  If such key is found, the ER server processes the ERP message
   as described in [RFC5296] then creates the ERP/DEA answer as
   described in Section 6.  The rMSK is included in this answer.

   Finally, the authenticator extracts the rMSK from the ERP/DEA as

   described in [RFC5296], and forwards the content of the EAP-Payload
   AVP, the EAP-Finish/Re-Auth message, to the peer.

   If the EAP-Initiate/Re-Auth message has its 'B' flag set
   (Bootstrapping exchange), the ER server should not possess the root
   key in its local database .  In this case, the ER server acts as a
   proxy, and forwards the message to the home EAP server after changing
   its Application Id to Diameter EAP and adding an AVP to request the
   root key.  See section Section 5 for more detail on this process.

5.  Bootstrapping the ER server

   The bootstrapping process involves the home EAP server and the ER
   server, but also impacts the peer and the authenticator.  In ERP, the
   peer must derive the same keying material as the ER server.  To
   achieve this, it must learn the domain name of the ER server.  How
   this information is acquired is outside the scope of this
   specification, but it may involves that the authenticator is
   configured to advertize this domain name, especially in the case of
   re-authentication after a handover.

   The bootstrapping of an ER server with a given root key happens
   either during the initial EAP authentication of the peer when the
   EMSK -- from which the root key is derived -- is created, during the
   first re-authentication, or sometime between those events.  We only
   consider the first two possibilities in this specification, in the
   following subsections.

5.1.  Bootstrapping during initial EAP authentication

   Bootstrapping the ER server during the initial EAP authentication
   (also known as implicit bootstrapping) offers the advantage that the
   server is immediatly available for re-authentication of the peer,
   thus minimizing the re-authentication delay.  On the other hand, it
   is possible that only a small number of peers will use re-
   authentication in the visited domain.  Deriving and caching key
   material for all the peers (for example, for the peers that do not
   support ERP) is a waste of resources and SHOULD be avoided.

   To achieve implicit bootstrapping, the ER server must act as a
   Diameter EAP Proxy as defined in Diameter Base Protocol [RFC3588],
   and routing must be configured so that Diameter messages of a full
   EAP authentication are routed through this proxy.  The figure bellow
   captures this mechanism.

         Figure. ERP bootstrapping during full EAP authentication

   The ER server proxies the first DER of the full EAP authentication
   and adds the ERP-RK-Request AVP inside, if this AVP is not already in
   the message (which might happen if there are ER servers in the
   visited and the home domains), then forwards the request.

   If the EAP server does not support ERP extensions, it will simply
   ignore this grouped AVP and continue as specified in [RFC4072].  If
   the server supports the ERP extensions, it caches the ERP-Realm value
   with the session, and continues the EAP authentication.  When the
   authentication is complete, if it is successful and the EAP method
   generated an EMSK, the server MUST compute the rRK or rDSRK
   (depending on the value of ERP-Realm) as specified in [RFC5296], and
   add an ERP-RK-Answer AVP in the Diameter-EAP-Request message, in
   addition to the MSK and EAP-Success payloads.

   When the ER server proxies a Diameter-EAP-Answer message with a
   Session-Id corresponding to a message to which it added an ERP-RK-
   Answer, and the Result-Code is DIAMETER_SUCCESS, it MUST examine the
   message, extract and remove any ERP-RK-Answer AVP from the message,
   and save its content.  If the message does not contain an ERP-RK-
   Answer AVP, the ER server MAY save this information to avoid possible

   subsequent re-authentication attempts for this session.  In any case,
   the information stored SHOULD NOT have a lifetime greater than the
   EMSK lifetime

   If the ER server is successfully bootstrapped, it MAY also add the
   ERP-Realm AVP after removing the ERP-RK-Answer AVP in the EAP/DEA
   message.  This could be used by the authenticator to notify the peer
   that ERP is bootstrapped, with the ER domain information.  How this
   information can be transmitted to the peer is outside the scope of
   this document.

5.2.  Bootstrapping during first re-authentication

   Bootstrapping the ER server during the first re-authentication (also
   known as explicit bootstrapping) offers several advantages: it saves
   resources, since we generate and cache only root key that we actually
   need, and it can accomodate inter-domain handovers or ER servers that
   loose their state (for example after reboot) .  On the other hand,
   the first re-authentication with the ER server requires a one-round-
   trip exchange with the home EAP server, which adds some delay to the
   process (but it is more efficient than a full EAP authentication in
   any case).  It also requires some synchronization between the peer
   and the visited domain: since the ERP message is different for
   explicit bootstrapping exchange and for normal re-authentication,
   explicit bootstrapping should not be used if implicit bootstrapping
   was already performed.

   The ER server receives the ERP/DER message containing the EAP-
   Initiate/Re-Auth message with the 'B' flag set.  It proxies this
   message, and do the following processing in addition to standard
   proxy operations:

      Change the Application Id in the header of the message to Diameter
      EAP Application (code 5).

      Change the content of Application-Auth-Id accordingly.

      Add the ERP-RK-Request AVP, which contains the name of the domain
      where the ER server is located.



   Then the server forwards the EAP/DER request, which is routed to the
   home EAP server.

   If the home EAP server does not support ERP extensions, it replies
   with an error since the encapsulated EAP-Initiate/Re-auth command is
   not understood.  Otherwise, it processes the ERP request as described

   in [RFC5296].  In particular, it includes the Domain-Name TLV
   attribute with the content from the ERP-Realm AVP.  It creates the
   EAP/DEA reply message following standard processing from [RFC4072]
   (in particular EAP-Master-Session-Key AVP is used to transport the
   rMSK), and includes the ERP-RK-Answer AVP.

   The ER server receives this EAP/DEA and proxies it as follow, in
   addition to standard proxy operations:

      Set the Application Id back to Diameter ERP (code TBD)

      Extract and cache the content of the ERP-RK-Answer.

   The DEA is then forwarded to the authenticator, that can use the rMSK
   as described in [RFC5296].

   The figure below captures this proxy behavior:

                      Figure. Diameter ERP exchange.

   In ERP, the peer sends an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message to the ER
   server via the authenticator.  Alternatively, the NAS may send an
   EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start message to the peer to trigger the start
   of ERP.  In this case, the peer responds with an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth
   message to the NAS.

   If the authenticator does not support ERP (pure [RFC4072] support),
   it discards the EAP packets with unknown ERP-specific code (EAP-
   Initiate).  The peer may fallback to full EAP authentication in such
   case.

   When the authenticator receives an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message from
   the peer, it process as described in [RFC5296] with regards to the
   EAP state machine.  It creates a Diameter EAP Request message
   following the general process of Diameter EAP [RFC4072], with the
   following differences:

      The Application Id in the header is set to Diameter ERP (code TBD
      ).

      The value in Auth-Application-Id AVP is also set to Diameter ERP
      Application.

      The keyName-NAI attribute from ERP message is used to create the
      content of User-Name AVP and Destination-Realm AVP.

Internet-Draft          Diameter support for ERP            October 2009




      The Auth-Request-Type AVP content is set to [Editor's note: FFS].

      The EAP-Payload AVP contains the ERP message, EAP-Initiate/
      Re-Auth.

   Then this ERP/DER message is sent as described in Section 4.

   The ER server receives and processes this request as described in
   Section 4.  It then creates a Diameter answer ERP/DEA, following the
   general processing described in [RFC4072], with the following
   differences:

      The Application Id in the header is set to Diameter ERP (code
      TBD).

      The value in Auth-Application-Id AVP is also set to Diameter ERP
      Application.

      The Result-Code AVP is set to an error value in case ERP
      authentication fails, or to DIAMETER_SUCCESS if ERP is successful.

      The EAP-Payload AVP contains the ERP message, EAP-Finish/Re-auth.

      In case of successful authentication, the EAP-Master-Session-Key
      AVP contains the Re-authentication Master Session Key (rMSK)
      derived by ERP.



   When the authenticator receives this ERP/DEA answer, it processes it
   as described in Diameter EAP [RFC4072] and [RFC5296]: the content of
   EAP-Payload AVP content is forwarded to the peer, and the content of
   EAP-Master-Session-Key AVP is used as a shared secret for Secure
   Association Protocol.

7.  Application Id

   We define a new Diameter application in this document, Diameter ERP
   Application, with an Application Id value of TBD.  Diameter nodes
   conforming to this specification in the role of ER server MUST
   advertise support by including an Auth-Application-Id AVP with a
   value of Diameter ERP Application in the of the Capabilities-
   Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands, as
   described in [RFC3588].

   The primary use of the Diameter ERP Application Id is to ensure

   proper routing of the messages, and that the nodes that advertise the
   support for this application do understand the new AVPs defined in
   section Section 8 , although these AVP have the 'M' flag cleared.

8.  AVPs

   This specification defines the following new AVPs.

8.1.  ERP-RK-Request AVP

   The ERP-RK-Request AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type grouped AVP.  This
   AVP is used by the ER server to indicate its willingness to act as ER
   server for a particular session.

   This AVP has the M and V bits cleared.

         ERP-RK-Request ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                            { ERP-Realm }
                          * [ AVP ]

                        Figure. ERP-RK-Request ABNF

8.2.  ERP-Realm AVP

   The ERP-Realm AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type DiameterIdentity.  It
   contains the name of the realm in which the ER server is located.

   This AVP has the M and V bits cleared.

8.3.  ERP-RK-Answer AVP

   The ERP-RK-Answer AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type grouped AVP.  It is
   used by the home EAP server to provide ERP root key material to the
   ER server.

   This AVP has the M and V bits cleared.

          ERP-RK-Answer ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                            { ERP-RK }
                            { ERP-RK-Name }
                            { ERP-RK-Lifetime }
                          * [ AVP ]

Internet-Draft          Diameter support for ERP            October 2009


8.4.  ERP-RK AVP

   The ERP-RK AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString.  It contains
   the root key (either rRK or rDSRK) sent by the home EAP server to the
   ER server, in answer to request containing an ERP-RK-Request AVP.
   How this material is derived and used is specified in [RFC5296].

   This AVP has the M and V bits cleared.

8.5.  ERP-RK-Name AVP

   The ERP-RK-Name AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString.  This AVP
   contains the EMSKname which identifies the keying material.  How this
   name is derived is beyond the scope of this document and defined in
   [RFC5296].

   This AVP has the M and V bits cleared.

8.6.  ERP-RK-Lifetime AVP

   The ERP-RK-Lifetime AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32 and
   contains the root key material remaining lifetime in seconds.  It
   MUST not be greater than the remaining lifetime of the EMSK it is
   derived from.

   This AVP has the M and V bits cleared.

9.  Commands

   We do not define any new command in this specification.  We reuse the
   Diameter-EAP-Request and Diameter-EAP-Answer commands defined in
   [RFC4072].

   Since the original ABNF of these commands allow other optional AVPs
   ("* [ AVP ]"), and the new AVPs defined in this specification do not
   have the 'M' flag set, the ABNF does not need any change.  Anyway, a
   Diameter node that advertizes support for the Diameter ERP
   application MUST support the new AVPs defined in this specification.

10.  Open issues

   This document does not address some known issues in Diameter ERP
   mechanism.  The authors would like to hear ideas about how to address
   them.

   The main issue is the use of ERP for authentication after a handover
   of the peer to a new authenticator (or different authenticator port).
   Diameter ERP is not meant to be a mobility protocol.  A number of
   issues appear when we try to do handover in Diameter ERP (alone): how
   to manage the Session-Id AVP; how does the ER server provide the
   Authorization AVPs; how does the peer learn the ERP domain of the new
   authenticator; how does the home server reachs the peer to for
   example terminate the session; and so on...  Therefore, the
   management of the session for a mobile peer is not (yet) addressed in
   this document.  It must be studied how Diameter ERP can be for
   example used in conjunction with a mobility application (Diameter
   MIP4, Diameter MIP6) to support the optimized re-authentication in
   such situation.

   Another issue concerns the case where the home realm contains several
   EAP servers.  In multi rounds full EAP authentication, the
   Destination-Host AVP provides the solution to reach the same server
   across the exchanges.  Only this server possess the EMSK for the
   session.  In case of explicit bootstrapping, the ER server must
   therefore be able to reach the correct server to request the DSRK.  A
   solution might consist in saving the Origin-Host AVP of all
   successful EAP/DEA in the ER server, which is a bit similar to the
   implicit bootstrapping scenario described here -- only we save the
   server name instead of the root key, and we must then be able to
   match the DSRK with the user name.

   Finally, this document currently lacks a description of what happens
   when a Re-Auth-Request is received for a peer on the authenticator.

12.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires IANA registration of the following new
   elements in the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
   Parameters [1] registries.

12.1.  Diameter ERP application

   This specification requires IANA to allocate a new value "Diameter
   ERP" in the "Application IDs" registry created by in [RFC3588].

      Application Identifier             | Value
      -----------------------------------+------
      Diameter ERP                       | TBD

              IANA consideration for Diameter ERP application

12.2.  New AVPs

   This specification requires IANA to allocate new values from the "AVP
   Codes" registry defined in [RFC3588] for the following AVPs:

      ERP-RK-Request

      ERP-Realm

      ERP-RK-Answer

      ERP-RK

      ERP-RK-Name

      ERP-RK-Lifetime

   These AVPs are defined in section Section 8.

13.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations from the following RFC apply here:
   [RFC3588], [RFC4072], [RFC5247], [RFC5295], and [RFC5296].

   EAP channel bindings may be necessary to ensure that the Diameter
   client and the server are in sync regarding the key Requesting
   Entity's Identity.  Specifically, the Requesting Entity advertises
   its identity through the EAP lower layer, and the user or the EAP
   peer communicates that identity to the EAP server (and the EAP server
   communicates that identity to the Diameter server) via the EAP method
   for user/peer to server verification of the Requesting Entity's
