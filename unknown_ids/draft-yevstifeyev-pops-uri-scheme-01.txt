INTERNET DRAFT           The 'pops' URI Scheme         February 15, 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Post Office Protocol, Version 3 (POP3), that is defined in RFC
   1939 [RFC1939], is an application-layer protocol used by local e-mail
   clients to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a TCP/IP
   connection.  However since the time of appearance of this protocol,
   it has been widely implemented over Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [RFC5246] and its deprecated predecessor Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

   RFC 2384 [RFC2384] already defines the Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) 'pop' scheme that is used for referencing the POP3 mailboxes. 
   However this scheme supports only usual POP3 over Transmission
   Control Protocol (TCP) [RFC793] operations; not aforementioned POP3
   over TLS connections.  This document specifies the URI scheme used
   for referencing the POP3 mailboxes that are available using POP3 over
   TLS connection.

   Generic URI syntax is described in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  Procedures
   for registration of new URI schemes are defined in RFC 4395
   [RFC4395].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

INTERNET DRAFT           The 'pops' URI Scheme         February 15, 2011


2.  The 'pops' URI Scheme Definition

   The 'pops' URI scheme is used to designate the access to POP3
   [RFC1939] mailboxes that are available via the POP3 over TLS binding,
   as described below.  The user agent, using the 'pops' URI, should
   firstly request the password (and the user name, if not given in the
   URI) from the client, if this is required by the chosen
   authentication mechanism, and then SHALL establish the TCP [RFC793]
   connection, begin TLS handshake [RFC5246], open the POP3 transaction,
   identify itself using the credentials requested before (or use any
   other authentication method) and then send all the data under TLS
   layer [RFC5246].

   There is already the 'pop' URI scheme used for referencing the POP3
   mailboxes over usual TCP connection [RFC2384].  Since the 'pops' URI
   scheme defined by this document is used to provide the access to the
   same resources as 'pop' one (i. e. POP3 mailboxes), only using
   different connection types, the syntax of these schemes are the same
   either, except the 'scheme' part.  It is described using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] as follows:

   pops-uri    = scheme ":" hier-part
   scheme      = "pops"
   hier-part   = "//" [user-auth "@"] host [":" port] ["/"]
   user-auth   = user [auth]
   user        = 1*achar
   auth        = ";AUTH=" ("*" / auth-type)
   auth-type   = auth-sasl / auth-ext
   auth-sasl   = 1*achar
   auth-ext    = "+" ("APOP" / 1*achar)
   achar       = ALPHA / DIGIT / pct-encoded / "$" / "-" / "_" / "." /
                 "+" / "!" / "*" / "'" / "(" / ")" / ","

   The 'host', 'port' and 'pct-encoded' rules are described in RFC 3986
   [RFC3986], Appendix A.  The core rules 'ALPHA' and 'DIGIT' are used
   as described in RFC 5234 [RFC5234], Appendix B.

   If 'port' part is omitted, it SHALL default to 995.  If the
   characters ";" and "=" appear in the 'user' part, they MUST be
   percent-encoded, as described in Section 2.1 of RFC 3986 [RFC3986]. 
   The final character "/" MAY be omitted.

   The 'auth' part of the 'pops' URIs allows to choose what
   authentication mechanism will be used after the establishing the
   connection.  The ";AUTH=*" assumes that no special authentication
   mechanism SHOULD be used - i. e. the user name and password SHOULD be
   transmitted via the USER and PASS commands, respectively.  If another
   authentication type is assumed, it SHOULD be used after the

   establishing the connection, as described below. 

   If the 'auth-type' part does not starts with "+", the Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [RFC4422] SHOULD be used for
   authentication.

   If the 'auth-type' part starts with "+", that APOP or other specified
   external authentication mechanism SHOULD be assumed to be used.  

   Please note that the user agent MAY use another authentication
   mechanism than defined in the 'pops' URI if it is properly set.

3.  Security Considerations

   Generic security considerations for the usage of URIs are discussed
   in Section 7 of RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

   The 'pops' URI designates the secure TLS connection for POP3
   transaction.  Moreover, it allows to choose what authentication
   mechanism SHOULD be used for user authentication over such
   connection.

   More security issues may be added by other authentication mechanisms
   for POP3.  These mechanism are not discussed by this memo.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the 'pops' URI scheme using the following
   template (see RFC 4395 [RFC4395]):

     URI scheme name: pops

     Status: Permanent

     URI scheme syntax: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx

     URI scheme semantics: see Section 2 of RFC xxxx

     URI scheme encoding considerations: Generic encoding considerations
     for URI schemes, defined in Section 2 of [RFC3986], concern 'pops'
     one as well.  Non-ASCII characters are to be mapped as defined in
     Section 3.1 of RFC 3987 [RFC3987]

     Protocols that use the scheme: POP3 over TLS connections, as
     described in RFC xxxx

     Security considerations: see Section 3 of RFC xxxx
