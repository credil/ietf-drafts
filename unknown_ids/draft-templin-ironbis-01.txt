              The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON)
                      draft-templin-ironbis-01.txt

Abstract

   Since the Internet must continue to support escalating growth due to
   increasing demand, it is clear that current routing architectures and
   operational practices must be updated.  This document proposes an
   Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) architecture that supports
   sustainable growth while requiring no changes to end systems and no
   changes to the existing routing system.  IRON further addresses other
   important issues including routing scaling, mobility management,
   multihoming, traffic engineering and NAT traversal.  While business
   considerations are an important determining factor for widespread
   adoption, they are out of scope for this document.

Internet-Draft                    IRON                       August 2011


1.  Introduction

   Growth in the number of entries instantiated in the Internet routing
   system has led to concerns regarding unsustainable routing scaling
   [RADIR].  Operational practices such as the increased use of
   multihoming with Provider-Independent (PI) addressing are resulting
   in more and more fine-grained prefixes being injected into the
   routing system from more and more end user networks.  Furthermore,
   depletion of the public IPv4 address space has raised concerns for
   both increased address space fragmentation (leading to yet further
   routing table entries) and an impending address space run-out
   scenario.  At the same time, the IPv6 routing system is beginning to
   see growth [BGPMON] which must be managed in order to avoid the same
   routing scaling issues the IPv4 Internet now faces.  Since the
   Internet must continue to scale to accommodate increasing demand, it
   is clear that new routing methodologies and operational practices are
   needed.

   Several related works have investigated routing scaling issues.
   Virtual Aggregation (VA) [GROW-VA] and Aggregation in Increasing
   Scopes (AIS) [EVOLUTION] are global routing proposals that introduce
   routing overlays with Virtual Prefixes (VPs) to reduce the number of
   entries required in each router's Forwarding Information Base (FIB)
   and Routing Information Base (RIB).  Routing and Addressing in
   Networks with Global Enterprise Recursion (RANGER) [RFC5720] examines
   recursive arrangements of enterprise networks that can apply to a
   very broad set of use-case scenarios [RFC6139].  IRON specifically
   adopts the RANGER Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) tunnel
   virtual-interface model, and uses Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET)
   [INTAREA-VET] and the Subnetwork Adaptation and Encapsulation Layer
   (SEAL) [INTAREA-SEAL] as its functional building blocks.

   This document proposes an Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON)
   architecture with goals of supporting sustainable growth while
   requiring no changes to the existing routing system.  IRON borrows
   concepts from VA and AIS, and further borrows concepts from the
   Internet Vastly Improved Plumbing (Ivip) [IVIP-ARCH] architecture
   proposal along with its associated Translating Tunnel Router (TTR)
   mobility extensions [TTRMOB].  Indeed, the TTR model to a great
   degree inspired the IRON mobility architecture design discussed in
   this document.  The Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal
   techniques adapted for IRON were inspired by the Simple Address
   Mapping for Premises Legacy Equipment (SAMPLE) proposal [SAMPLE].

   IRON supports scalable addressing without changing the current BGP
   [RFC4271] routing system.  IRON observes the Internet Protocol
   standards [RFC0791][RFC2460], while other network-layer protocols
   that can be encapsulated within IP packets (e.g., OSI/CLNP

   (Connectionless Network Protocol) [RFC1070], etc.) are also within
   scope.

   IRON is a global routing system comprising Virtual Service Provider
   (VSP) overlay networks that service Virtual Prefixes (VPs) from which
   End User Network (EUN) prefixes (EPs) are delegated to customer
   sites.  IRON is motivated by a growing customer demand for
   multihoming, mobility management, and traffic engineering while using
   stable addressing to minimize dependence on network renumbering
   [RFC4192][RFC5887].  IRON VSP overlay network instances use the
   existing IPv4 and IPv6 global Internet routing systems as virtual
   NBMA links for tunneling inner network protocol packets within outer
   IPv4 or IPv6 headers (see Section 3).  Each IRON instance requires
   deployment of a small number of new BGP core routers and supporting
   servers, as well as IRON-aware clients that connect customer EUNs.
   No modifications to hosts, and no modifications to most routers, are
   required.  The following sections discuss details of the IRON
   architecture.


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   End User Network (EUN):
      an edge network that connects an organization's devices (e.g.,
      computers, routers, printers, etc.) to the Internet.

   End User Network Prefix (EP):
      a more specific inner network-layer prefix (e.g., an IPv4 /28, an
      IPv6 /56, etc.) derived from an aggregated Virtual Prefix (VP)and
      delegated to an EUN by a Virtual Service Provider (VSP).

   End User Network Prefix Address (EPA):
      a network-layer address belonging to an EP and assigned to the
      interface of an end system in an EUN.

   Forwarding Information Base (FIB):
      a data structure containing network prefixes to next-hop mappings;
      usually maintained in a router's fast-path processing lookup
      tables.

   Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON):
      the union of all VSP overlay network instances.  Each such IRON
      instance supports routing within the overlay through encapsulation
      of inner packets with EPA addresses within outer headers that use
      locator addresses.  Each IRON instance connects to the global
      Internet the same as for any autonomous system.

Internet-Draft                    IRON                       August 2011


   IRON Client Router/Host ("Client"):
      a customer's router or host that logically connects the customer's
      EUNs and their associated EPs to an IRON instance via an NBMA
      tunnel virtual interface.

   IRON Serving Router ("Server"):
      a VSP's IRON instance router that provides forwarding and mapping
      services for the EPs owned by customer Clients.

   IRON Relay Router ("Relay"):
      a VSP's IRON instance router that acts as a relay between the IRON
      and the native Internet.

   IRON Agent (IA):
      generically refers to any of an IRON Client/Server/Relay.

   Internet Service Provider (ISP):
      a service provider that connects customer EUNs to the underlying
      Internetwork.  In other words, an ISP is responsible for providing
      basic Internet connectivity for customer EUNs.

   Locator
      an IP address assigned to the interface of a router or end system
      within a public or private network.  Locators taken from public IP
      prefixes are routable on a global basis, while locators taken from
      private IP prefixes are made public via Network Address
      Translation (NAT).

   Routing and Addressing in Networks with Global Enterprise Recursion
   (RANGER):
      an architectural examination of virtual overlay networks applied
      to enterprise network scenarios, with implications for a wider
      variety of use cases.

   Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL):
      an encapsulation sublayer that provides extended packet
      identification and a Control Message Protocol to ensure
      deterministic network-layer feedback.

   Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET):
      a method for discovering border routers and forming dynamic
      tunnel-neighbor relationships over enterprise networks (or sites)
      with varying properties.

   Virtual Prefix (VP):
      a prefix block (e.g., an IPv4 /16, an IPv6 /20, an OSI Network
      Service Access Protocol (NSAP) prefix, etc.) that is owned and
      managed by a Virtual Service Provider (VSP).

Internet-Draft                    IRON                       August 2011


   Virtual Service Provider (VSP):
      a company that owns and manages a set of VPs from which it
      delegates EPs to EUNs.

   VSP Overlay Network:
      a specialized set of routers deployed by a VSP to service customer
      EUNs through an IRON instance configured over an underlying
      Internetwork (e.g., the global Internet).


3.  The Internet Routing Overlay Network

   The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) is a union of Virtual
   Service Provider (VSP) overlay network instances connected to a
   common Internetwork.  While the principles presented in this document
   are discussed within the context of the public global Internet, they
   can also be applied to any autonomous Internetwork.  The rest of this
   document therefore refers to the terms "Internet" and "Internetwork"
   interchangeably except in cases where specific distinctions must be
   made.

   Each IRON instance consists of IRON Agents (IAs) that automatically
   tunnel the packets of end-to-end communication sessions within
   encapsulating headers used for Internet routing.  IAs use the Virtual
   Enterprise Traversal (VET) [INTAREA-VET] virtual NBMA link model in
   conjunction with the Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer
   (SEAL) [INTAREA-SEAL] to encapsulate inner network-layer packets
   within outer headers, as shown in Figure 1.

     Figure 1: Encapsulation of Inner Packets within Outer IP Headers

   VET specifies the automatic tunneling mechanisms used for
   encapsulation, while SEAL specifies the format and usage of the SEAL
   header as well as a set of control messages.  Most notably, IAs use
   the SEAL Control Message Protocol (SCMP) to deterministically
   exchange and authenticate control messages such as route
   redirections, indications of Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU)
   limitations, destination unreachables, etc.  IAs appear as neighbors
   on an NBMA virtual link, and form bidirectional and/or unidirectional
   tunnel-neighbor relationships.

   Each IRON instance comprises a set of IAs distributed throughout the
   Internet to serve highly aggregated Virtual Prefixes (VPs).  VSPs
   delegate sub-prefixes from their VPs, which they lease to customers
   as End User Network Prefixes (EPs).  In turn, the customers assign
   the EPs to their customer edge IAs, which connect their End User
   Networks (EUNs) to the VSP IRON instance.

   VSPs may have no affiliation with the ISP networks from which
   customers obtain their basic Internet connectivity.  Therefore, a
   customer could procure its summary network services either through a
   common provider or through separate entities.  In that case, the VSP
   can open for business and begin serving its customers immediately
   without the need to coordinate its activities with ISPs or other
   VSPs.  Further details on business considerations are out of scope
   for this document.

   IRON requires no changes to end systems or to most routers in the

   Internet.  Instead, IAs are deployed either as new platforms or as
   modifications to existing platforms.  IAs may be deployed
   incrementally without disturbing the existing Internet routing
   system, and act as waypoints (or "cairns") for navigating VSP overly
   networks.  The functional roles for IAs are described in the
   following sections.

3.1.  IRON Client

   An IRON client (or, simply, "Client") is a customer's router or host
   that logically connects the customer's EUNs and their associated EPs
   to its VSP's IRON instance via tunnels, as shown in Figure 2.  Client
   routers obtain EPs from their VSPs and use them to number subnets and
   interfaces within their EUNs.  A Client can be deployed on the same
   physical platform that also connects the customer's EUNs to its ISPs,
   but it may also be a separate router or even a standalone server
   system located within the EUN.  (This model applies even if the EUN
   connects to the ISP via a Network Address Translator (NAT) -- see
   Section 6.7).  Finally, a Client may also be a simple end system that
   connects a singleton EUN and exhibits the outward appearance of a
   host.

3.2.  IRON Serving Router

   An IRON serving router (or, simply, "Server") is a VSP's router that
   provides forwarding and mapping services within the IRON instance for
   the EPs owned by customer Client routers.  In typical deployments, a
   VSP will deploy many Servers around the IRON instance in a globally
   distributed fashion (e.g., as depicted in Figure 3) so that Clients

         Figure 3: IRON Serving Router Global Distribution Example

   Each Server acts as a tunnel-endpoint router that forms bidirectional
   tunnel-neighbor relationships with each of its Client customers and
   also serves as the tunnel egress of dynamically discovered
   unidirectional tunnel-neighbors.  Each Server also associates with a
   set of Relays that can forward packets from the IRON out to the
   native Internet and vice versa, as discussed in the next section.

3.3.  IRON Relay Router

   An IRON Relay Router (or, simply, "Relay") is a router that acts as a
   relay between the VSP's IRON instance and the native Internet.
   Therefore, it also serves as an Autonomous System Border Router
   (ASBR) that is owned and managed by the VSP.

   Each VSP configures one or more Relays that advertise the company's
   VPs into the IPv4 and IPv6 global Internet BGP routing systems.  Each
   Relay associates with all of the VSP's IRON instance Servers, e.g.,
   via tunnels over the IRON instance, via a direct interconnect such as
   an Ethernet cable, etc.  The Relay role is depicted in Figure 4.

4.  IRON Organizational Principles

   The IRON consists of the union of all VSP overlay networks configured
   over a common Internetwork (e.g., the public Internet).  Each such
   IRON instance represents a distinct "patch" on the Internet "quilt",
   where the patches are stitched together by standard Internet routing.
   When a new IRON instance is deployed, it becomes yet another patch on
   the quilt and coordinates its internal routing system independently
   of all other patches.

   Each IRON instance maintains a set of Relays and Servers that provide
   services to Client customers.  In order to ensure adequate customer
   service levels, the VSP should conduct a traffic scaling analysis and
   distribute sufficient Relays and Servers for the IRON instance
   globally throughout the Internet.  Figure 5 depicts the logical
   arrangement of Relays, Servers, and Clients in an IRON instance.

                        Figure 5: IRON Organization

   Each Relay connects the IRON instance directly to the IPv4 and IPv6
   Internets.  It also advertises the VSP's IPv4 VPs into the IPv4 BGP
   routing system and advertises the VSP's IPv6 VPs into the IPv6 BGP
   routing system.  Relays will therefore receive packets with EPA
   destination addresses sent by end systems in the Internet and forward
   them via tunnels toward EPA-addressed end systems connected to the
   VSP's IRON instance.

   Each VSP also manages a set of Servers that connect their Clients and
   associated EUNs to the IRON instance and to the IPv6 and IPv4
   Internets via their associations with Relays.  IRON Servers therefore
   need not be BGP routers themselves; they can be simple commodity
   hardware platforms.  The Server and Relay functions can further be
   deployed together on the same physical platform as a unified gateway,
   or they may be deployed on separate platforms (e.g., for load
   balancing purposes).

   Each Server maintains a working set of bidirectional tunnel-neighbor
   Clients for which it caches EP-to-Client mappings in its Forwarding
   Information Base (FIB).  Each Server also, in turn, propagates the
   list of EPs in its working set to each of the Relays in the IRON



Templin                 Expires February 6, 2012               [Page 12]

   instance via a dynamic routing protocol (e.g., an internal BGP
   instance that carries only the EP-to-Server mappings and does not
   interact with the external BGP routing system).  Therefore, each
   Server only needs to track the EPs for its current working set of
   Clients, while each Relay will maintain a full EP-to-Server routing
   information base that represents reachability information for all EPs
   in the IRON instance.

   Customers establish Clients that obtain their basic Internet
   connectivity from ISPs and connect to Servers to attach their EUNs to
   the IRON instance.  Each EUN can further connect to the IRON instance
   via multiple Clients as long as the Clients coordinate with one
   another, e.g., to mitigate EUN partitions.  Unlike Relays and
   Servers, Clients may use private addresses behind one or several
   layers of NATs.  Each Client initially discovers a list of nearby
   Servers then forms a bidirectional tunnel-neighbor relationship with
   one of the Servers through an initial exchange followed by periodic
   keepalives.

   After the Client selects a Server, it forwards initial outbound
   packets from its EUNs by tunneling them to the Server, which may, in
   turn, forward them to the nearest Relay within the IRON instance.
   The Client may subsequently receive redirect messages informing it of
   a more direct route through a different Server within the IRON
   instance that serves the final destination EUN.  This Server in turn
   provides a unidirectional tunnel-neighbor egress for route
   optimization purposes,.

   The IRON can also be used to support VPs of network-layer address
   families that cannot be routed natively in the underlying
   Internetwork (e.g., OSI/CLNP over the public Internet, IPv6 over
   IPv4-only Internetworks, IPv4 over IPv6-only Internetworks, etc.).
   Further details for the support of IRON VPs of one address family
   over Internetworks based on other address families are discussed in
   Appendix A.


5.  IRON Initialization

   Each IRON instance is initialized through the startup actions of IAs
   and customer EUNs.  The following sub-sections discuss these startup
   procedures.

5.1.  IRON Relay Router Initialization

   Each IRON Relay is provisioned with the list of VPs that it will
   serve, as well as the locators for all Servers within the IRON
   instance.  The Relay is also provisioned with external BGP



Templin                 Expires February 6, 2012               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                    IRON                       August 2011


   interconnections -- the same as for any BGP router.

   Upon startup, the Relay engages in BGP routing exchanges with its
   peers in the IPv4 and/or IPv6 Internets the same as for any BGP
   router.  It then connects to all of the Servers in the IRON instance
   (e.g., via a secured TCP connection over a bidirectional tunnel, via
   an Internal BGP (IBGP) route reflector, etc.) for the purpose of
   discovering EP-to-Server mappings.  After the Relay has fully
   populated its EP-to-Server mapping information database, it is said
   to be "synchronized" with respect to its VPs.

   After this initial synchronization procedure, the Relay then
   advertises the VPs externally.  In particular, the Relay advertises
   the IPv6 VPs into the IPv6 BGP routing system and advertises the IPv4
   VPs into the IPv4 BGP routing system.  The Relay then engages in
   ordinary packet-forwarding operations.

5.2.  IRON Serving Router Initialization

   Each IRON Server is provisioned with the locators for all Relays
   within the IRON instance.  Upon startup, each Server must connect to
   all of the Relays within the IRON instance (e.g., via a secured TCP
   connection, via an IBGP route reflector, etc.) for the purpose of
   reporting the list of EPs it is currently serving.  The Server then
   actively listens for Client customers that register their EP prefixes
   as part of establishing a bidirectional tunnel-neighbor relationship.
   When a new Client connects, the Server announces the new EP routes to
   all Relays; when an existing Client disconnects, the Server withdraws
   its announcements.

5.3.  IRON Client Initialization

   Each Client obtains one or more EPs in an initial secured exchange
   with the VSP, e.g., as part of the initial customer signup agreement.
   Upon startup, the Client connects to a location broker (e.g., a well
   known website run by the VSP) to discover a list of nearby Servers.

   After the Client obtains a list of nearby Servers, it initiates a
   short transaction with one or more Servers (e.g., via a secured TCP
   connection) in order to establish a bidirectional tunnel-neighbor
   relationship.  During the transaction, each Server provides the
   Client with a tunnel-neighbor identifier ("NBR_ID") and a Shared
   Secret that the Client will use to sign and authenticate certain
   control messages.  The protocol details of the transaction are
   specific to the VSP, and hence out of scope for this document.

6.  IRON Operation

   Following the initialization operations detailed in Section 5, IAs
   engage in the cooperative process of receiving and forwarding
   packets.  All IAs forward encapsulated packets over the IRON instance
   using the mechanisms of VET [INTAREA-VET] and SEAL [INTAREA-SEAL],
   while Relays additionally forward packets to and from the native IPv6
   and IPv4 Internets.  IAs also use SCMP to coordinate with other IAs,
   including the process of sending and receiving redirect messages,
   error messages, etc.  Each IA operates as specified in the following
   sub-sections.

6.1.  IRON Client Operation

   After selecting Servers as specified in Section 5.3, the Client
   registers one or more active ISP connections with each Server.  To do
   so, it sends periodic beacons (e.g., cryptographically signed SRS
   messages) to the Server via each ISP connection to maintain tunnel-
   neighbor address mapping state.  The beacons should be sent at no
   more than 60 second intervals (subject to a small random delay) so
   that state in NATs on the path as well as on the Server itself is
   refreshed regularly.  Although the Client may connect via multiple
   ISPs, a single NBR_ID is used to represent the set of all ISP paths
   the Client has registered with this Server.  The NBR_ID therefore
   names this "bundle" of tunnel-neighbor ISP connections.

   If the Client ceases to receive acknowledgements from a Server via a
   specific ISP connection, it marks the Server as unreachable from that
   ISP.  (The Client should also inform the Server of this outage via
   one of its working ISP connections.)  If the Client ceases to receive
   acknowledgements from the Server via multiple ISP connections, it
   withdraws its registration with this server and registers with a new
   nearby Server.  The act of withdrawing from the old server and
   registering with the new server will soon propagate the appropriate
   routing information among the IRON instance's Relay Routers.

   When an end system in an EUN sends a flow of packets to a
   correspondent, the packets are forwarded through the EUN via normal
   routing until they reach the Client, which then tunnels the initial
   packets to a Server as the next hop.  In particular, the Client
   encapsulates each packet in an outer header with its locator as the
   source address and the locator of the Server as the destination
   address.  After sending the initial packets of a flow, the Client may
   receive important control messages, such as indications of PMTU
   limitations, redirect messages that indicate a better tunnel-neighbor
   next hop, etc.

   The Client uses the mechanisms specified in VET and SEAL to



Templin                 Expires February 6, 2012               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                    IRON                       August 2011


   encapsulate each packet to be forwarded.  The Client further uses the
   SCMP protocol to coordinate with Servers, including accepting
   redirects and other control messages.

6.2.  IRON Serving Router Operation

   After the Server is initialized, it accepts Client connections and
   authenticates the SRS messages it receives from its connected tunnel-
   neighbor Clients.  The Server discards any SRS messages that failed
   authentication, and responds to authentic SRS messages by returning
   signed SRAs.

   When the Server receives a SEAL-encapsulated data packet from one of
   its bidirectional tunnel-neighbor Clients, it uses normal longest-
   prefix-match rules to locate a FIB entry that matches the packet's
   inner destination address.  If the matching FIB entry is more-
   specific than default, the next hop is another of the Server's
   tunnel-neighbor Clients; otherwise, the next-hop is a Relay which
   serves as a default router.  The Server then re-encapsulates the
   packet (i.e., it removes the outer header and replaces it with a new
   outer header of the same address family), sets the outer destination
   address to the locator address of the next hop and tunnels the packet
   to the next hop.

   When the Server receives a SEAL-encapsulated data packet from either
   a Relay or from a unidirectional tunnel-neighbor Client, it again
   locates a FIB entry that matches the packet's inner destination
   address.  If the matching FIB entry is more-specific than default,
   the Server re-encapsulates the packet and forwards it to the correct
   bidirectional tunnel-neighbor Client.  If the Client has recently
   moved to a different Server, however, the Server also returns an SCMP
   redirect message listing a NULL next hop to inform the previous hop
   that the Client has moved.

   Note that Server-to-Server tunneling is not permitted, since this
   could result in sustained routing loops in which Server A has a route
   to Server B, and Server B has a route to Server A. This implies that
   a Server must never accept and process a redirect message, but must
   instead relay the redirect message to the appropriate bidirectional
   Client.  The permissible data flow paths for tunneled packets that
   flow through a Server are therefore:

   o  From a bidirectional Client customer to another bidirectional
      Client customer (i.e., a hairpin route)

   o  From a bidirectional Client customer to a default Relay router

   o  From a default Relay router to a bidirectional Client customer

   o  From a unidirectional foreign Client to a bidirectional Client
      customer

6.3.  IRON Relay Router Operation

   After each Relay has synchronized its VPs (see Section 5.1) it
   advertises them in the IPv4 and IPv6 Internet BGP routing systems.
   These prefixes will be represented as ordinary routing information in
   the BGP, and any packets originating from the IPv4 or IPv6 Internet
   destined to an address covered by one of the prefixes will be
   forwarded to one of the VSP's Relays.

   When a Relay receives a packet from the Internet destined to an EPA
   covered by one of its VPs, it behaves as an ordinary IP router.  In
   particular, the Relay looks in its FIB to discover a locator of a
   Server that serves the EP covering the destination address.  The
   Relay then simply encapsulates the packet with its own locator as the
   outer source address and the locator of the Server as the outer
   destination address and forwards the packet to the Server.

6.4.  IRON Reference Operating Scenarios

   IRON supports communications when one or both hosts are located
   within EP-addressed EUNs.  The following sections discuss the
   reference operating scenarios.

6.4.1.  Both Hosts within Same IRON Instance

   When both hosts are within EUNs served by the same IRON instance, it
   is sufficient to consider the scenario in a unidirectional fashion,
   i.e., by tracing packet flows only in the forward direction from
   source host to destination host.  The reverse direction can be
   considered separately and incurs the same considerations as for the
   forward direction.  The simplest case occurs when the EUNs that
   service the source and destination hosts are connected to the same
   server, while the general case occurs when the EUNs are connected to
   different Servers.  The two cases are discussed in the following
   sections.

6.4.1.1.  EUNs Served by Same Server

   In this scenario, the packet flow from the source host is forwarded
   through the EUN to the source's Client.  The Client then tunnels the
   packets to the Server, which simply relays the tunneled packets to
   the destination's Client.  The destination's Client then removes the
   packets from the tunnel and forwards them over the EUN to the

           Figure 6: Sustained Packet Flow via Hairpinned Route

   With reference to Figure 6, Host A sends packets destined to Host B
   via its network interface connected to EUN A.  Routing within EUN A
   will direct the packets to Client(A) as a default router for the EUN,
   which then uses VET and SEAL to encapsulate them in outer headers
   with its locator address as the outer source address, the locator
   address of Server(S) as the outer destination address, and the NBR_ID
   parameters associated with its tunnel-neighbor state as the identity.
   Client(A) then simply forwards the encapsulated packets into its ISP
   network connection that provided its locator.  The ISP will forward
   the encapsulated packets into the Internet without filtering since
   the (outer) source address is topologically correct.  Once the
   packets have been forwarded into the Internet, routing will direct
   them to Server(S).

Internet-Draft                    IRON                       August 2011


   Server(S) will receive the encapsulated packets from Client(A) then
   check its FIB to discover an entry that covers destination address B
   with Client(B) as the next hop.  Server(S) then re-encapsulates the
   packets in a new outer header that uses the source address,
   destination address, and NBR_ID parameters associated with the
   tunnel-neighbor state for Client(B).  Server(S) then forwards these
   re-encapsulated packets into the Internet, where routing will direct
   them to Client(B).  Client(B) will, in turn, decapsulate the packets
   and forward the inner packets to Host B via EUN B.

   In this scenario, no further route optimization is supported within
   the IRON framework, since IRON does not make provisions for Client-
   to-Client binding updates.  Each Client therefore need only
   coordinate its locator to EP mappings with its Server(s), and does
   not update bindings with any of its recent correspondents.

6.4.1.2.  EUNs Served by Different Servers

   In this scenario, the initial packets of a flow produced by a source
   host within an EUN connected to the IRON instance by a Client must
   flow through both the Server of the source host and a nearby Relay,
   but route optimization can eliminate these elements from the path for
   subsequent packets in the flow.  Figure 7 shows the flow of initial
   packets from Host A to Host B within EUNs of the same IRON instance:

              Figure 7: Initial Packet Flow Before Redirects

   With reference to Figure 7, Host A sends packets destined to Host B
   via its network interface connected to EUN A.  Routing within EUN A
   will direct the packets to Client(A) as a default router for the EUN,
   which then encapsulates them in outer headers and forwards the
   encapsulated packets into the ISP network connection that provided
   its locator.  The ISP will forward the encapsulated packets into the
   Internet, where routing will direct them to Server(A).

   Server(A) receives the encapsulated packets from Client(A) then
   rewrites the outer source address to one of its own locator addresses
   and rewrites the outer destination address to the address of a nearby
   Relay(R).  Server(A) then forwards the revised encapsulated packets
   into the Internet, where routing will direct them to Relay(R).

   Relay(R) receives the encapsulated packets from Server(A) then checks
   its FIB to discover an entry that covers inner destination address B
   with Server(B) as the next hop.  Relay(R) then returns SCMP redirect

   messages to Server(A), rewrites the outer destination address of the
   encapsulated packets to the locator address of Server(B), and
   forwards these revised packets to Server(B).

   Server(B) receives the encapsulated packets from Relay(R) then checks
   its FIB to discover an entry that covers destination address B with
   Client(B) as the next hop.  Server(B) then re-encapsulates the
   packets in a new outer header that uses the source address,
   destination address, and NBR_ID parameters associated with the
   tunnel-neighbor state for Client(B).  Server(B) then forwards these
   re-encapsulated packets into the Internet, where routing will direct
   them to Client(B).  Client(B) will, in turn, decapsulate the packets
   and forward the inner packets to Host B via EUN B.

   Note that after the initial flow of packets, Server(A) will have
   received one or more SCMP redirect messages from Relay(R) listing
   Server(B) as a better next hop.  Server(A) will, in turn, proxy the
   redirects to Client(A), which will establish unidirectional tunnel-
   neighbor state listing Server(B) as the next hop toward the EP that
   covers Host B. Client(A) thereafter forwards its encapsulated packets
   directly to the locator address of Server(B) without involving either
   Server(A) or Relay(B), as shown in Figure 8.

               Figure 9: From IRON Host A to Non-IRON Host B

   In this scenario, Host A sends packets destined to Host B via its
   network interface connected to IRON EUN A.  Routing within EUN A will
   direct the packets to Client(A) as a default router for the EUN,
   which then encapsulates them and sends them into the ISP network.
   The ISP will pass the packets without filtering since the (outer)
   source address is topologically correct.  Once the packets have been
   released into the native Internet, the Internet routing system will
   direct them to Server(A).

   Server(A) receives the encapsulated packets from Client(A) then re-
   encapsulates and forwards them to Relay(A), which simply decapsulates
   them and forwards the unencapsulated packets into the Internet.  Once
   the packets are released into the Internet, routing will direct them
   to the final destination B. (Note that Server(A) and Relay(A) are
   depicted in Figure 9 as two halves of a unified gateway.  In that
   case, the "forwarding" between Server(A) and Relay(A) is a zero-
   instruction imaginary operation within the gateway.)

   packets and forward the inner packets to Host A via its network
   interface connected to IRON EUN A.

6.4.3.  Hosts within Different IRON Instances

   Figure 11 depicts the IRON reference operating scenario for packets
   flowing between Host A in an IRON instance A and Host B in a
   different IRON instance B. In that case, forwarding between hosts A
   and B always involves the Servers and Relays of both IRON instances,
   i.e., the scenario is no different than if one of the hosts was
   serviced by an IRON EUN and the other was serviced by a non-IRON EUN.

6.5.  Mobility, Multiple Interfaces, Multihoming, and Traffic
      Engineering Considerations

   While IRON Servers and Relays can be considered as fixed
   infrastructure, Clients may need to move between different network
   points of attachment, connect to multiple ISPs, or explicitly manage



Templin                 Expires February 6, 2012               [Page 25]

Internet-Draft                    IRON                       August 2011


   their traffic flows.  The following sections discuss mobility,
   multihoming, and traffic engineering considerations for IRON Client
   routers.

6.5.1.  Mobility Management

   When a Client changes its network point of attachment (e.g., due to a
   mobility event), it configures one or more new locators.  If the
   Client has not moved far away from its previous network point of
   attachment, it simply informs its Server of any locator additions or
   deletions.  This operation is performance sensitive and should be
   conducted immediately to avoid packet loss.

   If the Client has moved far away from its previous network point of
   attachment, however, it re-issues the Server discovery procedure
   described in Section 5.3 to discover whether its candidate set of
   Servers has changed.  If the Client's current Server is also included
   in the new list received from the VSP, this provides indication that
   the Client has not moved far enough to warrant changing to a new
   Server.  Otherwise, the Client may wish to move to a new Server in
   order to reduce routing stretch.  This operation is not performance
   critical, and therefore can be conducted over a matter of seconds/
   minutes instead of milliseconds/microseconds.

   To move to a new Server, the Client first engages in the EP
   registration process with the new Server, as described in Section
   5.3.  The Client then informs its former Server that it has departed;
   again, via a VSP-specific secured reliable transport connection.  The
   former Server will then withdraw its EP advertisements from the VSP
   routing system and retain the (stale) FIB entries until their
   lifetime expires.  In the interim, the Server continues to deliver
   packets to the Client's last-known locator addresses for the short
   term while informing any unidirectional tunnel-neighbors that the
   Client has moved.

6.5.2.  Multiple Interfaces and Multihoming

   A Client may register multiple ISP connections with each Server.  It
   can assign metrics with its registrations to inform the Server of
   preferred ISP connections, and it can select outgoing ISP connections
   according to its outbound traffic requirements.  Therefore, multiple
   interfaces are naturally supported.

   A Client may further register with multiple Servers for fault
   tolerance and reduced routing stretch.  In that case, the Client
   should register each of its ISP connections with each of its Servers
   unless it has a way of carefully coordinating its ISP-to-Server
   mappings.  (However, unpredictable performance may result if the



Templin                 Expires February 6, 2012               [Page 26]

Internet-Draft                    IRON                       August 2011


   Client registers only preferred ISP connections with Server A and
   backup ISP connections with Server B.)

   Client registration with multiple Servers results in "pseudo-
   multihoming", in which the multiple homes are within the same VSP
   IRON instance.  True multihoming would only apply if the Client were
   to connect to multiple IRON instances and receive a different set of
   EPs from each instance.

6.5.3.  Inbound Traffic Engineering

   A Client can dynamically adjust the priorities of its locator
   registrations with its Server in order to influence inbound traffic
   flows.  It can also change between Servers when multiple Servers are
   available, but should strive for stability in its Server selection in
   order to limit VSP network routing churn.

6.5.4.  Outbound Traffic Engineering

   A Client can select outgoing locators, e.g., based on current
   Quality-of-Service (QoS) considerations such as minimizing delay or
   variance.

6.6.  Renumbering Considerations

   As new link-layer technologies and/or service models emerge,
   customers will be motivated to select their service providers through
   healthy competition between ISPs.  If a customer's EUN addresses are
   tied to a specific ISP, however, the customer may be forced to
   undergo a painstaking EUN renumbering process if it wishes to change
   to a different ISP [RFC4192][RFC5887].

   When a customer obtains EP prefixes from a VSP, it can change between
   ISPs seamlessly and without need to renumber.  If the VSP itself
   applies unreasonable costing structures for use of the EPs, however,
   the customer may be compelled to seek a different VSP and would again
   be required to confront a renumbering scenario.

6.7.  NAT Traversal Considerations

   The Internet today consists of a global public IPv4 routing and
   addressing system with non-IRON EUNs that use either public or
   private IPv4 addressing.  The latter class of EUNs connect to the
   public Internet via Network Address Translators (NATs).  When a
   Client is located behind a NAT, it selects Servers using the same
   procedures as for Clients with public addresses and can then send SRS
   messages to Servers in order to get SRA messages in return.  The only
   requirement is that the Client must configure its SEAL encapsulation



Templin                 Expires February 6, 2012               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft                    IRON                       August 2011


   to use a transport protocol that supports NAT traversal, e.g., UDP,
   TCP, SSL, etc.

   Since the Server maintains state about its Client customers, it can
   discover locator information for each Client by examining the UDP
   port number and IP address in the outer headers of the Client's
   encapsulated SRS packets.  When there is a NAT in the path, the
   transport port number and IP address in each encapsulated packet will
   correspond to state in the NAT box and might not correspond to the
   actual values assigned to the Client.  The Server can then
   encapsulate packets destined to hosts in the Client's EUN within
   outer headers that use this IP address and UDP port number.  The NAT
   box will receive the packets, translate the values in the outer
   headers, then forward the packets to the Client.  In this sense, the
   Server's "locator" for the Client consists of the concatenation of
   the IP address and transport port number.

   IRON does not introduce any new issues to complications raised for
   NAT traversal or for applications embedding address referrals in
   their payload.

6.8.  Multicast Considerations

   IRON Servers and Relays are topologically positioned to provide
   Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) / Multicast Listener
   Discovery (MLD) proxying for their Clients [RFC4605].  Further
   multicast considerations for IRON (e.g., interactions with multicast
   routing protocols, traffic scaling, etc.) will be discussed in a
   separate document.

6.9.  Nested EUN Considerations

   Each Client configures a locator that may be taken from an ordinary
   non-EPA address assigned by an ISP or from an EPA address taken from
   an EP assigned to another Client.  In that case, the Client is said
   to be "nested" within the EUN of another Client, and recursive
   nestings of multiple layers of encapsulations may be necessary.

   For example, in the network scenario depicted in Figure 12, Client(A)
   configures a locator EPA(B) taken from the EP assigned to EUN(B).
   Client(B) in turn configures a locator EPA(C) taken from the EP
   assigned to EUN(C).  Finally, Client(C) configures a locator ISP(D)
   taken from a non-EPA address delegated by an ordinary ISP(D).  Using
   this example, the "nested-IRON" case must be examined in which a Host
   A, which configures the address EPA(A) within EUN(A), exchanges
   packets with Host Z located elsewhere in the Internet.

   The two cases of Host A sending packets to Host Z, and Host Z sending
   packets to Host A, must be considered separately, as described below.

6.9.1.  Host A Sends Packets to Host Z

   Host A first forwards a packet with source address EPA(A) and
   destination address Z into EUN(A).  Routing within EUN(A) will direct
   the packet to Client(A), which encapsulates it in an outer header
   with EPA(B) as the outer source address and Server(A) as the outer
   destination address then forwards the once-encapsulated packet into
   EUN(B).  Routing within EUN(B) will direct the packet to Client(B),
   which encapsulates it in an outer header with EPA(C) as the outer
   source address and Server(B) as the outer destination address then
   forwards the twice-encapsulated packet into EUN(C).  Routing within



Templin                 Expires February 6, 2012               [Page 29]

Internet-Draft                    IRON                       August 2011


   EUN(C) will direct the packet to Client(C), which encapsulates it in
   an outer header with ISP(D) as the outer source address and Server(C)
   as the outer destination address.  Client(C) then sends this triple-
   encapsulated packet into the ISP(D) network, where it will be routed
   into the Internet to Server(C).

   When Server(C) receives the triple-encapsulated packet, it removes
   the outer layer of encapsulation and forwards the resulting twice-
   encapsulated packet into the Internet to Server(B).  Next, Server(B)
   removes the outer layer of encapsulation and forwards the resulting
   once-encapsulated packet into the Internet to Server(A).  Next,
   Server(A) checks the address type of the inner address 'Z'.  If Z is
   a non-EPA address, Server(A) simply decapsulates the packet and
   forwards it into the Internet.  Otherwise, Server(A) rewrites the
   outer source and destination addresses of the once-encapsulated
   packet and forwards it to Relay(Z).  Relay(Z), in turn, rewrites the
   outer destination address of the packet to the locator for Server(Z),
   then forwards the packet and sends a redirect to Server(A) (which
   forwards the redirect to Client(A)).  Server(Z) then re-encapsulates
   the packet and forwards it to Client(Z), which decapsulates it and
   forwards the inner packet to Host Z.  Subsequent packets from
   Client(A) will then use Server(Z) as the next hop toward Host Z,
   which eliminates Server(A) and Relay(Z) from the path.

6.9.2.  Host Z Sends Packets to Host A

   Whether or not Host Z configures an EPA address, its packets destined
   to Host A will eventually reach Server(A).  Server(A) will have a
   mapping that lists Client(A) as the next hop toward EPA(A).
   Server(A) will then encapsulate the packet with EPA(B) as the outer
   destination address and forward the packet into the Internet.
   Internet routing will convey this once-encapsulated packet to
   Server(B), which will have a mapping that lists Client(B) as the next
   hop toward EPA(B).  Server(B) will then encapsulate the packet with
   EPA(C) as the outer destination address and forward the packet into
   the Internet.  Internet routing will then convey this twice-
   encapsulated packet to Server(C), which will have a mapping that
   lists Client(C) as the next hop toward EPA(C).  Server(C) will then
   encapsulate the packet with ISP(D) as the outer destination address
   and forward the packet into the Internet.  Internet routing will then
   convey this triple-encapsulated packet to Client(C).

   When the triple-encapsulated packet arrives at Client(C), it strips
   the outer layer of encapsulation and forwards the twice-encapsulated
   packet to EPA(C), which is the locator address of Client(B).  When
   Client(B) receives the twice-encapsulated packet, it strips the outer
   layer of encapsulation and forwards the once-encapsulated packet to
   EPA(B), which is the locator address of Client(A).  When Client(A)

   receives the once-encapsulated packet, it strips the outer layer of
   encapsulation and forwards the unencapsulated packet to EPA(A), which
   is the host address of Host A.


7.  Implications for the Internet

   The IRON architecture envisions a hybrid routing/mapping system that
   benefits from both the shortest-path routing afforded by pure dynamic
   routing systems and the routing-scaling suppression afforded by pure
   mapping systems.  Therefore, IRON targets the elusive "sweet spot"
   that pure routing and pure mapping systems alone cannot satisfy.

   The IRON system requires a VSP deployment of new routers/servers
   throughout the Internet to maintain well-balanced virtual overlay
   networks.  These routers/servers can be deployed incrementally
   without disruption to existing Internet infrastructure and
   appropriately managed to provide acceptable service levels to
   customers.

   End-to-end traffic that traverses an IRON instance may experience
   delay variance between the initial packets and subsequent packets of
   a flow.  This is due to the IRON system allowing a longer path
   stretch for initial packets followed by timely route optimizations to
   utilize better next hop routers/servers for subsequent packets.

   IRON instances also work seamlessly with existing and emerging
   services within the native Internet.  In particular, customers
   serviced by an IRON instance will receive the same service enjoyed by
   customers serviced by non-IRON service providers.  Internet services
   already deployed within the native Internet also need not make any
   changes to accommodate VSP customers.

   The IRON system operates between routers within provider networks and
   end user networks.  Within these networks, the underlying paths
   traversed by the virtual overlay networks may comprise links that
   accommodate varying MTUs.  While the IRON system imposes an
   additional per-packet overhead that may cause the size of packets to
   become slightly larger than the underlying path can accommodate, IRON
   routers have a method for naturally detecting and tuning out
   instances of path MTU underruns.  In some cases, these MTU underruns
   may need to be reported back to the original hosts; however, the
   system will also allow for MTUs much larger than those typically
   available in current Internet paths to be discovered and utilized as
   more links with larger MTUs are deployed.

   Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the IRON system provides in-
   built mobility management, multihoming and traffic engineering



Templin                 Expires February 6, 2012               [Page 31]

Internet-Draft                    IRON                       August 2011


   capabilities that allow end user devices and networks to move about
   freely while both imparting minimal oscillations in the routing
   system and maintaining generally shortest-path routes.  This mobility
   management is afforded through the very nature of the IRON customer/
   provider relationship, and therefore requires no adjunct mechanisms.
   The mobility management and multihoming capabilities are further
   supported by forward-path reachability detection that provides "hints
   of forward progress" in the same spirit as for IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery (ND).


8.  Additional Considerations

   Considerations for the scalability of Internet Routing due to
   multihoming, traffic engineering, and provider-independent addressing
   are discussed in [RADIR].  Other scaling considerations specific to
   IRON are discussed in Appendix B.

   Route optimization considerations for mobile networks are found in
   [RFC5522].


9.  Related Initiatives

   IRON builds upon the concepts of the RANGER architecture [RFC5720] ,
   and therefore inherits the same set of related initiatives.  The
   Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) Routing Research Group (RRG)
   mentions IRON in its recommendation for a routing architecture
   [RFC6115].

   Virtual Aggregation (VA) [GROW-VA] and Aggregation in Increasing
   Scopes (AIS) [EVOLUTION] provide the basis for the Virtual Prefix
   concepts.

   Internet Vastly Improved Plumbing (Ivip) [IVIP-ARCH] has contributed
   valuable insights, including the use of real-time mapping.  The use
   of Servers as mobility anchor points is directly influenced by Ivip's
   associated TTR mobility extensions [TTRMOB].

   [RO-CR] discusses a route optimization approach using a Correspondent
   Router (CR) model.  The IRON Server construct is similar to the CR
   concept described in this work; however, the manner in which Clients
   coordinate with Servers is different and based on the redirection
   model associated with NBMA links [RFC5214].

   Numerous publications have proposed NAT traversal techniques.  The
   NAT traversal techniques adapted for IRON were inspired by the Simple
   Address Mapping for Premises Legacy Equipment (SAMPLE) proposal



Templin                 Expires February 6, 2012               [Page 32]

Internet-Draft                    IRON                       August 2011


   [SAMPLE].

   The IRON Client-Server relationship is managed in essentially the
   same way as for the Tunnel Broker model [RFC3053].  Numerous existing
   tunnel broker provider networks (e.g., Hurricane Electric, SixXS,
   freenet6, etc.) provide existence proofs that IRON-like overlay
   network services can be deployed and managed on a global basis
   [BROKER].


10.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations that apply to tunneling in general are
   discussed in [V6OPS-TUN-SEC].  Additional considerations that apply
   also to IRON are discussed in RANGER [RFC5720] , VET [INTAREA-VET]
   and SEAL [INTAREA-SEAL].

   The IRON system further depends on mutual authentication of IRON
   Clients to Servers and Servers to Relays.  This is accomplished
   through initial authentication exchanges that establish tunnel-
   neighbor NBR_ID values that can be used to detect off-path attacks.
   As for all Internet communications, the IRON system also depends on
   Relays acting with integrity and not injecting false advertisements
   into the BGP (e.g., to mount traffic siphoning attacks).

   IRON Servers must ensure that any changes in a Client's locator
   addresses are communicated only through an authenticated exchange
   that is not subject to replay.  For this reason, Clients periodically
   send digitally-signed SRS messages to the Server.  If the Client's
   locator address stays the same, the Server can accept the SRS message
   without verifying the signature as long as the NBR_ID of the SRS
   matches the Client.  If the Client's locator address changes, the
   Server must verify the SRS message's signature before accepting the
   message.  Once the message has been authenticated, the Server updates
   the Client's locator address to the new address.

   Each IRON instance requires a means for assuring the integrity of the
   interior routing system so that all Relays and Servers in the overlay
   have a consistent view of Client<->Server bindings.  Finally, Denial-
   of-Service (DoS) attacks on IRON Relays and Servers can occur when
   packets with spoofed source addresses arrive at high data rates.
   However, this issue is no different than for any border router in the
   public Internet today.

   Middleboxes can interfere with tunneled packets within an IRON
   instance in various ways.  For example, a middlebox may alter a
   packet's contents, change a packet's locator addresses, inject
   spurious packets, replay old packets, etc.  These issues are no

   different than for middlebox interactions with ordinary Internet
   communications.  If man-in-the-middle attacks are a matter for
   concern in certain deployments, however, IRON Agents can use IPsec to
   protect the authenticity, integrity and (if necessary) privacy of
   their tunneled packets.

Appendix A.  IRON VPs over Internetworks with Different Address Families

   The IRON architecture leverages the routing system by providing
   generally shortest-path routing for packets with EPA addresses from
   VPs that match the address family of the underlying Internetwork.
   When the VPs are of an address family that is not routable within the
   underlying Internetwork, however, (e.g., when OSI/NSAP [RFC4548] VPs
   are used within an IPv4 Internetwork) a global VP mapping database is
   required.  The mapping database allows the Relays of the local IRON
   instance to map VPs belonging to other IRON instances to companion
   prefixes taken from address families that are routable within the
   Internetwork.  For example, an IPv6 VP (e.g., 2001:DB8::/32) could be



Templin                 Expires February 6, 2012               [Page 36]

Internet-Draft                    IRON                       August 2011


   paired with a companion IPv4 prefix (e.g., 192.0.2.0/24) so that
   encapsulated IPv6 packets can be forwarded over IPv4-only
   Internetworks.

   In that case, every VP must be represented in a globally distributed
   Master VP database (MVPd) that maintains VP-to-companion prefix
   mappings for all VPs in the IRON.  The MVPd is maintained by a
   globally managed assigned numbers authority in the same manner as the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) currently maintains the
   master list of all top-level IPv4 and IPv6 delegations.  The database
   can be replicated across multiple servers for load balancing, much in
   the same way that FTP mirror sites are used to manage software
   distributions.

   Upon startup, each Relay advertises an IPv4 companion prefix (e.g.,
   192.0.2.0/24) into the internetwork IPv4 routing system and/or an
   IPv6 companion prefix (e.g., 2001:DB8::/64) into the internetwork
   IPv6 routing system for the IRON instance that it serves.  The Relay
   then configures the host number '1' in the IPv4 companion prefix
   (e.g., as 192.0.2.1) and the interface identifier '0' in the IPv6
   companion prefix (e.g., as 2001:DB8::0), and assigns the resulting
   addresses as "Relay anycast" addresses for the IRON instance.

   The Relay then discovers the full set of VPs for all other IRON
   instances by reading the MVPd.  The Relay reads the MVPd from a
   nearby server and periodically checks the server for deltas since the
   database was last read.  After reading the MVPd, the Relay has a full
   list of VP-to-companion prefix mappings.  The Relay can then forward
   packets toward EPAs belonging to other IRON instances by
   encapsulating them in an outer header of the companion prefix address
   family and using the Relay anycast address as the outer destination
   address.

   Possible encapsulations in this model include IPv6-in-IPv4, IPv4-in-
   IPv6, OSI/CLNP-in-IPv6, OSI/CLNP-in-IPv4, etc.

Appendix B.  Scaling Considerations

   Scaling aspects of the IRON architecture have strong implications for
   its applicability in practical deployments.  Scaling must be
   considered along multiple vectors, including Interdomain core routing
   scaling, scaling to accommodate large numbers of customer EUNs,
   traffic scaling, state requirements, etc.

   In terms of routing scaling, each VSP will advertise one or more VPs
   into the global Internet routing system from which EPs are delegated
   to customer EUNs.  Routing scaling will therefore be minimized when
   each VP covers many EPs.  For example, the IPv6 prefix 2001:DB8::/32



Templin                 Expires February 6, 2012               [Page 37]

Internet-Draft                    IRON                       August 2011


   contains 2^24 ::/56 EP prefixes for assignment to EUNs; therefore,
   the IRON could accommodate 2^32 ::/56 EPs with only 2^8 ::/32 VPs
   advertised in the interdomain routing core.  (When even longer EP
   prefixes are used, e.g., /64s assigned to individual handsets in a
   cellular provider network, considerable numbers of EUNs can be
   represented within only a single VP.)

   In terms of traffic scaling for Relays, each Relay represents an ASBR
   of a "shell" enterprise network that simply directs arriving traffic
   packets with EPA destination addresses towards Servers that service
   customer EUNs.  Moreover, the Relay sheds traffic destined to EPAs
   through redirection, which removes it from the path for the vast
   majority of traffic packets.  On the other hand, each Relay must
   handle all traffic packets forwarded between its customer EUNs and
   the non-IRON Internet.  The scaling concerns for this latter class of
   traffic are no different than for ASBR routers that connect large
   enterprise networks to the Internet.  In terms of traffic scaling for
   Servers, each Server services a set of the VSP customer EUNs.  The
   Server services all traffic packets destined to its EUNs but only
   services the initial packets of flows initiated from the EUNs and
   destined to EPAs.  Therefore, traffic scaling for EPA-addressed
   traffic is an asymmetric consideration and is proportional to the
   number of EUNs each Server serves.

   In terms of state requirements for Relays, each Relay maintains a
   list of all Servers in the IRON instance as well as FIB entries for
   all customer EUNs that each Server serves.  This state is therefore
   dominated by the number of EUNs in the IRON instance.  Sizing the
   Relay to accommodate state information for all EUNs is therefore
   required during overlay network planning.  In terms of state
   requirements for Servers, each Server maintains tunnel-neighbor state
   only for the customer EUNs it serves, and not for the customers
   served by other Servers in the IRON instance.  Finally, neither
   Relays nor Servers need keep state for final destinations of outbound
   traffic.

   Clients source and sink all traffic packets originating from or
   destined to the customer EUN.  Therefore, traffic scaling
   considerations for Clients are the same as for any site border
   router.  Clients also retain unidirectional tunnel state for the
   Servers for final destinations of outbound traffic flows.  This can
   be managed as soft state, since stale entries purged from the cache
   will be refreshed when new traffic packets are sent.
