INTERNET DRAFT 'Some Headers Not Recognized' HTTP StatusNovember 21, 2010


1  Introduction

1.1 Motivation

   HTTP is one of the most widely-used protocols in the Internet. One of
   the things which made it so popular is extensibility. One can easily
   add any header to the HTTP message. However, servers are not able to
   support all the HTTP headers. Generally, if a server does not
   recognize the header, it simply ignores it. The client is not
   notified about not processed headers.

   This document proposes mechanism which allows servers to notify
   clients about not processes or not recognized headers.

   The proposal is to send a response with definite status code to the
   client if one or more headers of request were not processed. This
   document defines 'Some Headers Not Recognized' HTTP status to be used
   in such occasions. 

1.2 Conventions

1.2.1 Conformance Criteria

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.2 Syntax Notation

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234].

   The following core rules are included by reference, as defined in
   [RFC5234], Appendix B.1: ALPHA (letters), CR (carriage return), CRLF
   (CR LF), CTL (controls), DIGIT (decimal 0-9), DQUOTE (double quote),
   HEXDIG (hexadecimal 0-9/A-F/a-f), LF (line feed), OCTET (any 8-bit
   sequence of data), SP (space), HTAB (horizontal tab), CHAR (any US-
   ASCII character), VCHAR (any visible US-ASCII character), and WSP
   (whitespace).

1.2.3 Terminology

   The terms user agent, client, server, proxy, and origin server have
   the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.1 specification ([RFC2616], Section
   1.3).

INTERNET DRAFT 'Some Headers Not Recognized' HTTP StatusNovember 21, 2010


2  General Overview

   This section gives a brief overview of issues discussed by this
   document.

   'Some Headers Not Recognized' HTTP status SHOULD be sent if server
   does not support one or more headers of request. Information about
   not recognized headers MUST be put into the body of response with
   'Some Headers Not Recognized' status. 

3  Technical Overview

3.1 Model of Work

   If a server receives request with unknown (for it) headers, it SHOULD
   send a response with 'Some Headers Not Recognized' status.
   Information about what headers were not recognized MUST be put into
   the body in this occasion. If a client receives such a response, it
   SHOULD avoid sending requests with headers mentioned in the body of
   response.

3.2 Technical Description

3.2.1 'Some Headers Not Recognized' Status

   'Some Headers Not Recognized' status is Informational. The status
   code 103 has been assigned to be used with this status. If a server
   sends a response with aforementioned status, it SHOULD continue
   processing of client's request.

3.2.2 Information About Headers Not Recognized

   If a response with 'Some Headers Not Recognized' status is sent,
   information about what headers were not recognized MUST be put into
   the body of the request. This information has the following format:

   headers_not_recognized_information = header_name [*(SP ";" header
   name)] header_name = <name of not recognized header>

4  IANA Considerations

   HTTP Status Code registry should be updates by the following entry:

   Value - 103

   Description - Some Headers Not Recognized

   Reference - this document.
