Abstract

   Some applications require the ability to provide an elevated
   probability of session establishment to specific sessions in times of
   network congestion.  When supported over the Internet Protocol suite,
   this may be facilitated through a network layer admission control
   solution that supports prioritized access to resources (e.g.,
   bandwidth).  These resources may be explicitly set aside for
   prioritized sessions, or may be shared with other sessions.  This
   document specifies extensions to the Resource reSerVation Protocol
   (RSVP) that can be used to support such an admission priority
   capability at the network layer.

   Based on current security concerns, these extensions are targeting
   applicability within a single domain.

Internet-Draft   RSVP Extensions for Admission Priority         May 2009


1.  Introduction

   Some applications require the ability to provide an elevated
   probability of session establishment to specific sessions in times of
   network congestion.

   Solutions to meet this requirement for elevated session establishment
   probability may involve session layer capabilities prioritizing
   access to resources controlled by the session control function.  As
   an example, entities involved in session control (such as SIP user
   agents, when the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261], is the
   session control protocol in use) can influence their treatment of
   session establishment requests (such as SIP requests).  This may
   include the ability to "queue" session establishment requests when
   those can not be immediately honored (in some cases with the notion
   of "bumping", or "displacement", of less important session
   establishment requests from that queue).  It may include additional
   mechanisms such as exemption from certain network management
   controls, and alternate routing.

   Solutions to meet the requirement for elevated session establishment
   probability may also take advantage of network layer admission
   control mechanisms supporting admission priority.  Networks usually
   have engineered capacity limits that characterize the maximum load
   that can be handled (say, on any given link) for a class of traffic
   while satisfying the quality of service requirements of that traffic
   class.  Admission priority may involve setting aside some network
   resources (e.g. bandwidth) out of the engineered capacity limits for
   the prioritized sessions only.  Or alternatively, it may involve
   allowing the prioritized sessions to seize additional resources
   beyond the engineered capacity limits applied to normal sessions.
   This document specifies the necessary extensions to support such
   admission priority when network layer admission control is performed
   using the Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) ([RFC2205]).

   [RFC3181] specifies the Signaled Preemption Priority Policy Element
   that can be signaled in RSVP so that network node may take into
   account this policy element in order to preempt some previously
   admitted low priority sessions in order to make room for a newer,
   higher priority session.  In contrast, this document specifies new
   RSVP extensions to increase the probability of session establishment
   without preemption of existing sessions.  This is achieved by
   engineered capacity techniques in the form of bandwidth allocation
   models.  In particular this document specifies two new RSVP Policy
   Elements allowing the admission priority to be conveyed inside RSVP
   signaling messages so that RSVP nodes can enforce selective bandwidth
   admission control decision based on the session admission priority.
   Appendix A of this document also provides examples of bandwidth

   allocation models which can be used by RSVP-routers to enforce such
   admission priority on every link.  A given reservation may be
   signaled with the admission priority extensions specified in the
   present document, with the preemption priority specified in [RFC3181]
   or with both.

   Based on current security concerns, these extensions are targeting
   applicability within a single domain.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document assumes the terminology defined in [RFC2753].  For
   convenience, the definition of a few key terms is repeated here:

   o  Policy Decision Point (PDP): The point where policy decisions are
      made.

   o  Local Policy Decision Point (LPDP): PDP local to the network
      element.

   o  Policy Enforcement Point (PEP): The point where the policy
      decisions are actually enforced.

   o  Policy Ignorant Node (PIN): A network element that does not
      explicitly support policy control using the mechanisms defined in
      [RFC2753].


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Overview of RSVP extensions and Operations

   Let us consider the case where a session requires elevated
   probability of establishment, and more specifically that the
   preference to be granted to this session is in terms of network layer
   "admission priority" (as opposed to preference granted through
   preemption of existing sessions).  By "admission priority" we mean
   allowing the priority session to seize network layer resources from
   the engineered capacity that has been set-aside for priority sessions
   (and not made available to normal sessions), or alternatively
   allowing the priority session to seize additional resources beyond
   the engineered capacity limits applied to normal sessions.

Internet-Draft   RSVP Extensions for Admission Priority         May 2009


   Session establishment can be conditioned to resource-based and
   policy-based network layer admission control achieved via RSVP
   signaling.  In the case where the session control protocol is SIP,
   the use of RSVP-based admission control in conjunction with SIP is
   specified in [RFC3312].

   Devices involved in the session establishment are expected to be
   aware of the application-level priority requirements of prioritized
   sessions.  For example, considering the case where the session
   control protocol is SIP, the SIP user agents may be made aware of the
   resource priority requirements of a given session using the
   "Resource-Priority" header mechanism specified in [RFC4412].  The
   end-devices involved in the upper-layer session establishment simply
   need to copy the application-level resource priority requirements
   (e.g. as communicated in SIP "Resource-Priority" header) inside the
   new RSVP Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element defined
   in this document.

   Conveying the application-level resource priority requirements inside
   the RSVP message allows this application level requirement to be
   mapped/remapped into a different RSVP "admission priority" at a
   policy boundary based on the policy applicable in that policy area.
   In a typical model (see [RFC2753]) where PDPs control PEPs at the
   periphery of the policy area (e.g. on the first hop router), PDPs
   would interpret the RSVP Application-Level Resource Priority Policy
   Element and map the requirement of the prioritized session into an
   RSVP "admission priority" level.  Then, PDPs would convey this
   information inside the new Admission Priority Policy Element defined
   in this document.  This way, the RSVP admission priority can be
   communicated to downstream PEPs (i.e.  RSVP Routers) of the same
   policy domain, which have LPDPs but no controlling PDP.  In turn,
   this means the necessary RSVP Admission priority can be enforced at
   every RSVP hop, including all the (possibly many) hops which do not
   have any understanding of Application-Level Resource Priority
   semantics.  It is not expected that the RSVP Application-Level
   Resource Priority Header Policy Element would be taken into account
   at RSVP-hops within a given policy area.  It is expected to be used
   at policy area boundaries only in order to set/reset the RSVP
   Admission Priority Policy Element.

   Remapping by PDPs of the Admission Priority Policy Element from the
   Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element may also be used
   at boundaries with other signaling protocols, such as the NSIS
   Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) for QoS Signaling
   ([I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp]).

   As can be observed, the framework described above for mapping/
   remapping application level resource priority requirements into an



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires November 29, 2009               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   RSVP Extensions for Admission Priority         May 2009


   RSVP admission priority can also be used together with [RFC3181] for
   mapping/remapping application level resource priority requirements
   into an RSVP preemption priority (when preemption is indeed deemed
   necessary by the priotized session handling policy).  In that case,
   when processing the RSVP Application-Level Resource Priority Policy
   Element, the PDPs at policy boundaries (or between various QoS
   signaling protocols) can map it into an RSVP "preemption priority"
   information.  This Preemption priority information comprises a setup
   preemption level and a defending preemption priority level that can
   then be encoded inside the Preemption Priority Policy Element of
   [RFC3181].

   Appendix B provides examples of various hypothetical policies for
   prioritized session handling, some of them involving admission
   priority, some of them involving both admission priority and
   preemption priority.  Appendix B also identifies how the Application-
   Level Resource Priority needs to be mapped into RSVP policy elements
   by the PDPs to realize these policies.

3.1.  Operations of Admission Priority

   The RSVP Admission Priority policy element defined in this document
   allows admission bandwidth to be allocated preferentially to
   prioritized sessions.  Multiple models of bandwidth allocation MAY be
   used to that end.

   A number of bandwidth allocation models have been defined in the IETF
   for allocation of bandwidth across different classes of traffic
   trunks in the context of Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering.
   Those include the Maximum Allocation Model (MAM) defined in
   [RFC4125], the Russian Dolls Model (RDM) specified in [RFC4127] and
   the Maximum Allocation model with Reservation (MAR) defined in
   [RFC4126].  These same models MAY however be applied for allocation
   of bandwidth across different levels of admission priority as defined
   in this document.  Appendix A provides an illustration of how these
   bandwidth allocation models can be applied for such purposes and also
   introduces an additional bandwidth allocation model that we term the
   Priority Bypass Model (PrBM).  It is important to note that the
   models described and illustrated in Appendix A are only informative
   and do not represent a recommended course of action.

   We can see in these examples how the RSVP Admission Priority can be
   used by RSVP routers to influence their admission control decision
   (for example by determining which bandwidth pool is to be used by
   RSVP for performing its bandwidth allocation) and therefore to
   increase the probability of reservation establishment.  In turn, this
   increases the probability of application level session establishment
   for the corresponding session.

4.  New Policy Elements

   The Framework document for policy-based admission control [RFC2753]
   describes the various components that participate in policy decision
   making (i.e., PDP, PEP and LPDP).

   As described in Section 3 of the present document, the Application-
   Level Resource Priority Policy Element and the Admission Priority
   Policy Element serve different roles in this framework:

   o  the Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element conveys
      application level information and is processed by PDPs

   o  the emphasis of Admission Priority Policy Element is to be simple,
      stateless, and light-weight such that it can be processed
      internally within a node's LPDP.  It can then be enforced
      internally within a node's PEP.  It is set by PDPs based on
      processing of the Application-Level Resource Priority Policy
      Element.

   [RFC2750] defines extensions for supporting generic policy based
   admission control in RSVP.  These extensions include the standard
   format of POLICY_DATA objects and a description of RSVP handling of
   policy events.

   The POLICY_DATA object contains one or more of Policy Elements, each
   representing a different (and perhaps orthogonal) policy.  As an
   example, [RFC3181] specifies the Preemption Priority Policy Element.
   This document defines two new Policy Elements called:

   o  the Admission Priority Policy Element

   o  the Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element

4.1.  Admission Priority Policy Element

   The format of the Admission Priority policy element is as shown in
   Figure 1:

   o  Adm. Priority (Admission Priority): 8 bits (unsigned)

      *  The admission control priority of the flow, in terms of access
         to network bandwidth in order to provide higher probability of
         session completion to selected flows.  Higher values represent
         higher priority.  A given Admission Priority is encoded in this
         information element using the same value as when encoded in the
         "Admission Priority" field of the "Admission Priority"
         parameter defined in [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec].  In other words, a
         given value inside the Admission Priority information element
         defined in the present document or inside the
         [I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec] Admission Priority field refers to the
         same admission priority.  Bandwidth allocation models such as
         those described in Appendix A are to be used by the RSVP router
         to achieve such increased probability of session establishment.
         The admission priority value effectively indicates which
         bandwidth constraint(s) of the bandwidth constraint model in
         use is(are) applicable to admission of this RSVP reservation.

   Note that the Admission Priority Policy Element does NOT indicate
   that this RSVP reservation is to preempt any other RSVP reservation.
   If a priority session justifies both admission priority and
   preemption priority, the corresponding RSVP reservation needs to
   carry both an Admission Priority Policy Element and a Preemption
   Priority Policy Element.  The Admission Priority and Preemption
   Priority are handled by LPDPs and PEPs as separate mechanisms.  They
   can be used one without the other, or they can be used both in
   combination.

4.1.1.  Admission Priority Merging Rules

   This section discusses alternatives for dealing with RSVP admission
   priority in case of merging of reservations.  As merging applies to
   multicast, this section also applies to multicast sessions.

   The rules for merging Admission Priority Policy Elements are defined
   by the value encoded inside the Merge Strategy field in accordance
   with the corresponding IANA registry.  The merge strategies (and
   associated values) defined by the present document are the same as
   those defined in [RFC3181] for merging Preemption Priority Policy
   Elements (see "IANA Considerations" section).

   The only difference with [RFC3181] is that this document does not
   recommend any merge strategies for Admission Priority, while
   [RFC3181] recommends the first of these merge strategies for
   Preemption Priority.  Note that with the Admission Priority (as is
   the case with the Preemption Priority), "Take highest priority"
   translates into "take the highest numerical value".

      *  Contains the priority value within the namespace of the
         application-level resource priority.  This value is encoded as
         per the "Resource Priority Priority-Value" IANA registry.  (See
         IANA Considerations section for the request to IANA to extend
         the registry to include this numerical value).

4.2.1.  Application-Level Resource Priority Modifying and Merging Rules

   When POLICY_DATA objects are protected by integrity, LPDPs should not
   attempt to modify them.  They MUST be forwarded as-is to ensure their
   security envelope is not invalidated.

   In case of multicast, when POLICY_DATA objects are not protected by
   integrity, LPDPs MAY merge incoming Application-Level Resource
   Priority elements to reduce their size and number.  When they do
   merge those, LPDPs MUST do so according to the following rule:

   o  The ALRP List in the outgoing APP_RESOURCE_PRI element MUST
      contain all the ALRPs appearing in the ALRP List of an incoming
      APP_RESOURCE_PRI element.  A given ALRP MUST NOT appear more than
      once.  In other words, the outgoing ALRP List is the union of the
      incoming ALRP Lists that are merged.

   As merging applies to Multicast, this rule also applies to Multicast
   sessions.

4.3.  Default Handling

   As specified in section 4.2 of [RFC2750], Policy Ignorant Nodes
   (PINs) implement a default handling of POLICY_DATA objects ensuring
   that those objects can traverse PIN nodes in transit from one PEP to
   another.  This applies to the situations where POLICY_DATA objects
   contain the Admission Priority Policy Element and the ALRP Policy
   Element specified in this document, so that those can traverse PIN
   nodes.

Internet-Draft   RSVP Extensions for Admission Priority         May 2009


   Section 4.2 of [RFC2750] also defines a similar default behavior for
   policy-capable nodes that do not recognized a particular Policy
   Element.  This applies to the Admission Priority Policy Element and
   the ALRP Policy Element specified in this document, so that those can
   traverse policy-capable nodes that do not support thes extensions
   defined in the present document.


5.  Security Considerations

   As this document defines extensions to RSVP, the security
   considerations of RSVP apply.  Those are discussed in [RFC2205],
   [RFC4230] and [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-security-groupkeying].  Approaches
   for addressing those concerns are discussed further below.

   A subset of RSVP messages are signaled with the Router Alert Option
   (RAO)([RFC2113],[RFC2711]).  The security aspects and common
   practices around the use of the current IP Router Alert option and
   consequences on the use of IP Router Alert by applications such as
   RSVP are discussed in [I-D.rahman-rtg-router-alert-considerations].
   As mentioned earlier, based on current security concerns (some of
   them associated with RAO), the extensions defined in this document
   are targeting applicability within a single domain.

   The ADMISSION_PRI and APP_RESOURCE_PRI Policy Elements defined in
   this document are signaled by RSVP through encapsulation in a Policy
   Data object as defined in [RFC2750].  Therefore, like any other
   Policy Elements, their integrity can be protected as discussed in
   section 6 of [RFC2750] by two optional security mechanisms.  The
   first mechanism relies on RSVP Authentication as specified in
   [RFC2747] and [RFC3097] to provide a chain of trust when all RSVP
   nodes are policy capable.  With this mechanism, the INTEGRITY object
   is carried inside RSVP messages.  The second mechanism relies on the
   INTEGRITY object within the POLICY_DATA object to guarantee integrity
   between RSVP Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) that are not RSVP
   neighbors.

5.1.  Use of RSVP Authentication between RSVP neighbors

   RSVP authentication can be used between RSVP neighbors that are
   policy capable.  RSVP Authentication (defined in [RFC2747] and
   [RFC3097]) SHOULD be supported by an implementation of the present
   document.

   With RSVP authentication, the RSVP neighbors use shared keys to
   compute the cryptographic signature of the RSVP message.
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-security-groupkeying] discusses key types, key
   provisioning methods as well as their respective applicability.

Internet-Draft   RSVP Extensions for Admission Priority         May 2009


5.2.  Use of INTEGRITY object within the POLICY_DATA object

   The INTEGRITY object within the POLICY_DATA object can be used to
   guarantee integrity between non-neighboring RSVP PEPs.  This is
   useful only when some RSVP nodes are Policy Ignorant Nodes (PINs).
   The INTEGRITY object within the POLICY_DATA object MAY be supported
   by an implementation of teh present document.

   Details for computation of the content of the INTEGRITY object can be
   found in Appendix B of [RFC2750].  This states that the Policy
   Decision Point (PDP), at its discretion, and based on destination
   PEP/PDP or other criteria, selects an Authentication Key and the hash
   algorithm to be used.  Keys to be used between PDPs can be
   distributed manually or via standard key management protocol for
   secure key distribution.

   Note that where non-RSVP hops may exist in between RSVP hops, as well
   as where RSVP capable Policy Ignorant Nodes (PINs) may exist in
   between PEPs, it may be difficult for the PDP to determine what is
   the destination PDP for a POLICY_DATA object contained in some RSVP
   messages (such as a Path message).  This is because in those cases
   the next PEP is not known at the time of forwarding the message.  In
   this situation, key shared across multiple PDPs may be used.  This is
   conceptually similar to the use of key shared across multiple RSVP
   neighbors discussed in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-security-groupkeying].
   We observe also that this issue may not exist in some deployment
   scenarios where a single (or low number of) PDP is used to control
   all the PEPs of a region (such as an administrative domain).  In such
   scenarios, it may be easy for a PDP to determine what is the next hop
   PDP, even when the next hop PEP is not known, simply by determining
   what is the next region that will be traversed (say based on the
   destination address).


6.  IANA Considerations

   As specified in [RFC2750], Standard RSVP Policy Elements (P-type
   values) are to be assigned by IANA as per "IETF Consensus" policy
   following the policies outlined in [RFC2434] (this policy is now
   called "IETF Review" as per [RFC5226]) .

   IANA needs to allocate two P-Types from the Standard RSVP Policy
   Element range:

   o  one P-Type to the Admission Priority Policy Element

   o  one P-Type to the Application-Level Resource Priority Policy
      Element.

Internet-Draft   RSVP Extensions for Admission Priority         May 2009


   In section 3.1, the present document defines a Merge Strategy field
   inside the Admission Priority policy element.  IANA needs to create a
   registry for this field and allocate the following values:

   o  1: Take priority of highest QoS

   o  2: Take highest priority

   o  3: Force Error on heterogeneous merge

   Following the policies outlined in [RFC5226], numbers in the range
   4-127 are allocated according to the "IETF Review" policy, numbers in
   the range 128-240 as "First Come First Served" and numbers between
   241-255 are reserved for "Private Use".  Value 0 is Reserved (for
   consistency with [RFC3181] Merge Strategy values).

   In section 3.1, the present document defines an Error Code field
   inside the Admission Priority policy element.  IANA needs to create a
   registry for this field and allocate the following values:

   o  0: NO_ERROR Value used for regular ADMISSION_PRI elements

   o  2: HETEROGENEOUS This element encountered heterogeneous merge

   Following the policies outlined in [RFC5226], numbers in the range
   3-127 are allocated according to the "IETF Review" policy, numbers in
   the range 128-240 as "First Come First Served" and numbers between
   241-255 are reserved for "Private Use".  Value 1 is Reserved (for
   consistency with [RFC3181] Error Code values).

   The present document defines an ALRP Namespace field in section 3.2
   that contains a numerical value identifying the namespace of the
   application-level resource priority.  The IANA already maintains the
   Resource-Priority Namespaces registry (under the SIP Parameters)
   listing all such namespace.  However, that registry does not
   currently allocate a numerical value to each namespace.  Hence, this
   document requests the IANA to extend the Resource-Priority Namespaces
   registry in the following ways:

   o  a new column should be added to the registry

   o  the title of the new column should be "Namespace Numerical Value
      *"

   o  in the Legend, add a line saying "Namespace Numerical Value = the
      unique numerical value identifying the namespace"

   o  add a line at the bottom of the registry stating the following "*
      : [RFCXXX] " where XXX is the RFC number of the present document

   o  allocate an actual numerical value to each namespace in the
      registry and state that value in the new "Namespace numerical
      Value *" column.

   A numerical value should be allocated immediately by IANA to all
   existing namespace.  Then, in the future, IANA should automatically
   allocate a numerical value to any new namespace added to the
   registry.

   The present document defines an ALRP Priority field in section 3.2
   that contains a numerical value identifying the actual application-
   level resource priority within the application-level resource
   priority namespace.  The IANA already maintains the Resource-Priority
   Priority-values registry (under the SIP Parameters) listing all such
   priorities.  However, that registry does not currently allocate a
   numerical value to each priority-value.  Hence, this document
   requests the IANA to extend the Resource-Priority Priority-Values
   registry in the following ways:

   o  for each namespace, the registry should be structured with two
      columns

   o  the title of the first column should read "Priority Values (least
      to greatest)"

   o  the first column should list all the values currently defined in
      the registry (e.g. for the drsn namespace: "routine", "priority",
      "immediate", "flash", "flash-override", "flash-override-override"
      for the drsn namespace)

   o  the title of the second column should read "Priority Numerical
      Value *"

   o  At the bottom of the registry, add a "Legend" with a line saying
      "Priority Numerical Value = the unique numerical value identifying
      the priority within a namespace"

   o  add a line at the bottom of the registry stating the following "*
      : [RFCXXX] " where XXX is the RFC number of the present document

   o  allocate an actual numerical value to each and state that value in
      the new "Priority Numerical Value *" column.

   A numerical value should be allocated immediately by IANA to all
   existing priority.  Then, in the future, IANA should automatically

   allocate a numerical value to any new namespace added to the
   registry.  The numerical value must be unique within each namespace.
   For the initial allocation, within each namespace, values should be
   allocated in decreasing order ending with 0 (so that the greatest
   priority is always allocated value 0).  For example, in the drsn
   namespace, "routine" would be allocated numerical value 5 and "flash-
   override-override" would be allocated numerical value 0.

Appendix A.  Examples of Bandwidth Allocation Model for Admission
             Priority

   Sections A.1 and A.2 respectively illustrate how the Maximum
   Allocation Model (MAM) ([RFC4125]) and the Russian Dolls Model (RDM)
   ([RFC4127]) can be used for support of admission priority.  The
   Maximum Allocation model with Reservation (MAR) ([RFC4126]) could
   also be used in a similar manner for support of admission priority.
   Section A.3 illustrates how a simple "Priority Bypass Model" can also
   be used for support of admission priority.

   For simplicity, operations with only a single "priority" level
   (beyond non-priority) are illustrated here; However, the reader will
   appreciate that operations with multiple priority levels can easily
   be supported with these models.

   In all the figures below:

      x represents a non-priority session

      o represents a priority session

A.1.  Admission Priority with Maximum Allocation Model (MAM)

   This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a
   Maximum Allocation Model (MAM) is used for bandwidth allocation
   across non-priority traffic and priority traffic.  A property of the
   Maximum Allocation Model is that priority traffic can not use more
   than the bandwidth made available to priority traffic (even if the

   non-priority traffic is not using all of the bandwidth available for
   it).

                    Figure 4: MAM Bandwidth Allocation

   Figure 4 shows a link within a routed network conforming to this
   document.  On this link are two amounts of bandwidth available to two
   types of traffic: non-priority and priority.

   If the non-priority traffic load reaches the maximum bandwidth
   available for non-priority, no additional non-priority sessions can
   be accepted even if the bandwidth reserved for priority traffic is
   not currently fully utilized.

   With the Maximum Allocation Model, in the case where the priority
   load reaches the maximum bandwidth reserved for priority sessions, no
   additional priority sessions can be accepted.

   As illustrated in Figure 4, an operator may map the MAM model onto
   the Engineered Capacity limits according to different policies.  At
   one extreme, where the proportion of priority traffic is reliably
   known to be fairly small at all times and where there may be some
   safety margin factored in the engineered capacity limits, the
   operator may decide to configure the bandwidth available for non-
   priority use to the full engineered capacity limits; effectively
   allowing the priority traffic to ride within the safety margin of
   this engineered capacity.  This policy can be seen as an economically
   attractive approach as all of the engineered capacity is made
   available to non-priority sessions.  This policy is illustrated as
   (1) in Figure 4.  As an example, if the engineered capacity limit on
   a given link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth available



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires November 29, 2009              [Page 20]

Internet-Draft   RSVP Extensions for Admission Priority         May 2009


   to non-priority traffic to X, and the bandwidth available to priority
   traffic to 5% of X. At the other extreme, where the proportion of
   priority traffic may be significant at times and the engineered
   capacity limits are very tight, the operator may decide to configure
   the bandwidth available to non-priority traffic and the bandwidth
   available to priority traffic such that their sum is equal to the
   engineered capacity limits.  This guarantees that the total load
   across non-priority and priority traffic is always below the
   engineered capacity and, in turn, guarantees there will never be any
   QoS degradation.  However, this policy is less attractive
   economically as it prevents non-priority sessions from using the full
   engineered capacity, even when there is no or little priority load,
   which is the majority of time.  This policy is illustrated as (3) in
   Figure 4.  As an example, if the engineered capacity limit on a given
   link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth available to non-
   priority traffic to 95% of X, and the bandwidth available to priority
   traffic to 5% of X. Of course, an operator may also strike a balance
   anywhere in between these two approaches.  This policy is illustrated
   as (2) in Figure 4.

   Figure 5 shows some of the non-priority capacity of this link being
   used.

A.2.  Admission Priority with Russian Dolls Model (RDM)

   This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a
   Russian Dolls Model (RDM) is used for bandwidth allocation across
   non-priority traffic and priority traffic.  A property of the Russian
   Dolls Model is that priority traffic can use the bandwidth which is
   not currently used by non-priority traffic.

   As with the MAM model, an operator may map the RDM model onto the
   Engineered Capacity limits according to different policies.  The
   operator may decide to configure the bandwidth available for non-
   priority use to the full engineered capacity limits; As an example,
   if the engineered capacity limit on a given link is X, the operator
   may configure the bandwidth available to non-priority traffic to X,
   and the bandwidth available to non-priority and priority traffic to
   105% of X.

   Alternatively, the operator may decide to configure the bandwidth
   available to non-priority and priority traffic to the engineered
   capacity limits; As an example, if the engineered capacity limit on a
   given link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth available
   to non-priority traffic to 95% of X, and the bandwidth available to
   non-priority and priority traffic to X.

   Finally, the operator may decide to strike a balance in between.  The

   considerations presented for these policies in the previous section
   in the MAM context are equally applicable to RDM.

   Figure 9 shows the case where only some of the bandwidth available to
   non-priority traffic is being used and a small amount of priority
   traffic is in place.  In that situation both new non-priority
   sessions and new priority sessions would be accepted.

A.3.  Admission Priority with Priority Bypass Model (PrBM)

   This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a
   simple Priority Bypass Model (PrBM) is used for bandwidth allocation
   across non-priority traffic and priority traffic.  With the Priority
   Bypass Model, non-priority traffic is subject to resource based
   admission control while priority traffic simply bypasses the resource
   based admission control.  In other words:

   o  when a non-priority session arrives, this session is subject to
      bandwidth admission control and is accepted if the current total
      load (aggregate over non-priority and priority traffic) is below
      the engineered/allocated bandwidth.

   o  when a priority session arrives, this session is admitted
      regardless of the current load.

   A property of this model is that a priority session is never
   rejected.

   The rationale for this simple scheme is that, in practice in some
   networks:

   o  the volume of priority sessions is very low for the vast majority
      of time, so it may not be economical to completely set aside
      bandwidth for priority sessions and preclude the utilization of
      this bandwidth by normal sessions in normal situations



Le Faucheur, et al.     Expires November 29, 2009              [Page 26]

Internet-Draft   RSVP Extensions for Admission Priority         May 2009


   o  even in congestion periods where priority sessions may be more
      heavily used, those always still represent a fairly small
      proportion of the overall load which can be absorbed within the
      safety margin of the engineered capacity limits.  Thus, even if
      they are admitted beyond the engineered bandwidth threshold, they
      are unlikely to result in noticeable QoS degradation.

   As with the MAM and RDM model, an operator may map the Priority
   Bypass model onto the Engineered Capacity limits according to
   different policies.  The operator may decide to configure the
   bandwidth limit for admission of non-priority traffic to the full
   engineered capacity limits; As an example, if the engineered capacity
   limit on a given link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth
   limit for non-priority traffic to X. Alternatively, the operator may
   decide to configure the bandwidth limit for non-priority traffic to
   below the engineered capacity limits (so that the sum of the non-
   priority and priority traffic stays below the engineered capacity);
   As an example, if the engineered capacity limit on a given link is X,
   the operator may configure the bandwidth limit for non-priority
   traffic to 95% of X. Finally, the operator may decide to strike a
   balance in between.  The considerations presented for these policies
   in the previous sections in the MAM and RDM contexts are equally
   applicable to the Priority Bypass Model.

   Figure 13 illustrates the bandwidth allocation with the Priority
   Bypass Model.

Appendix B.  Example Usages of RSVP Extensions

   This section provides examples of how RSVP extensions defined in this
   document can be used (in conjunctions with other RSVP functionality
   and SIP functionality) to enforce different hypothetical policies for
   handling prioritized sessions in a given administrative domain.  This
   Appendix does not provide additional specification.  It is only
   included in this document for illustration purposes.

   We assume an environment where SIP is used for session control and
   RSVP is used for resource reservation.

   We refer here to "Session Queueing" as the set of "session" layer
   capabilities that may be implemented by SIP user agents to influence
   their treatment of SIP requests.  This may include the ability to
   "queue" session requests when those can not be immediately honored
   (in some cases with the notion of "bumping", or "displacement", of
   less important session requests from that queue).  It may include
   additional mechanisms such as exemption from certain network
   management controls, and alternate routing.

   We only mention below the RSVP policy elements that are to be
   enforced by PEPs.  It is assumed that these policy elements are set
   at a policy area boundary by PDPs.  The Admission Priority and
   Preemption Priority RSVP policy elements are set by PDPs as a result
   of processing the Application Level Resource Priority Policy Element
   (which is carried in RSVP messages).

   If one wants to implement a prioritized service purely based on
   Session Queueing, one can achieve this by signaling prioritized

   sessions:

   o  using "Resource-Priority" header in SIP

   o  not using Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP

   o  not using Preemption Policy Element in RSVP

   If one wants to implement a prioritized service based on Session
   Queueing and on "prioritized access to network layer resources", one
   can achieve this by signaling prioritized sessions:

   o  using "Resource-Priority" header in SIP

   o  using Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP

   o  not using Preemption Policy Element in RSVP

   Establishment of prioritized sessions will not result in preemption
   of any session.  Different bandwidth allocation models can be used to
   offer different "prioritized access to network resources".  Just as
   examples, this includes strict setting aside of capacity for
   prioritized sessions as well as simple bypass of admission limits for
   prioritized sessions.

   If one wants to implement a prioritized service based on Session
   Queueing, on "prioritized access to network layer resources", and
   ensures that (say) "Prioritized-1" sessions can preempt
   "Prioritized-2" sessions, but non-prioritized sessions are not
   affected by preemption, one can do that by signaling prioritized
   sessions:

   o  using "Resource-Priority" header in SIP

   o  using Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP

   o  using Preemption Policy Element in RSVP with:

      *  setup (Prioritized-1) > defending (Prioritized-2)

      *  setup (Prioritized-2) <= defending (Prioritized-1)

      *  setup (Prioritized-1) <= defending (Non-Prioritized)

      *  setup (Prioritized-2) <= defending (Non-Prioritized)

   If one wants to implement a prioritized service based on Session
   Queueing, on "prioritized access to network layer resources", and

   ensure that prioritized sessions can preempt regular sessions, one
   could do that by signaling Prioritized sessions:

   o  using "Resource-Priority" header in SIP

   o  using Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP

   o  using Preemption Policy Element in RSVP with:

      *  setup (Prioritized) > defending (Non-Prioritized)

      *  setup (Non-Prioritized) <= defending (Prioritized)

   If one wants to implement a prioritized service based on Session
   Queueing, on "prioritized access to network layer resources", and
   ensure that prioritized sessions can partially preempt regular
   sessions (i.e. reduce their reservation size), one could do that by
   signaling prioritized sessions:

   o  using "Resource-Priority" header in SIP

   o  using Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP

   o  using Preemption in Policy Element RSVP with:

      *  setup (Prioritized) > defending (Non-Prioritized)

      *  setup (Non-Prioritized) <= defending (Prioritized)

   o  activate RFC4495 RSVP Bandwidth Reduction mechanisms
