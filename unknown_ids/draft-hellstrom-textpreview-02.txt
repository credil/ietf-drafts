Internet-Draft  Text conversation with real-time preview     August 2007


1.  Introduction

   This is a specification of a method for presentation of a real-time
   text conversation.  The aim is to give the participants in a
   conversation a good opportunity to perceive the real-time flow of the
   conversation and also provide a display of the history of the
   conversation that makes it easy to follow the flow.  One reason to
   specify the presentation method is to be able to give participants a
   synchronized view of the conversation even if they use different
   presentation characteristics.  The method is intended for use in a
   protocol environment where text can be transmitted in real-time or in
   fragments of messages.  The technique has different names but some
   are "real-time chat", "IM with Preview" and "IM with Real-time
   Preview".

   The method is possible to use for two-party calls and multi-party
   calls.  A two-party view is shown in Figure 1.

   The text is displayed in a traditional chat view, with labeled
   entries from each participant ordered in a list with newest entry
   last.  Older entries are scrolled up, out of the screen area when
   there is no room for them.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5].


3.  Scope

   This specification describes a method for presenting a text
   conversation with text flowing in real-time in a way that is similar
   to common text chat, but with the possibility to follow entries while
   they are created in a real-time preview area.  The method may be
   applied on any text conversation transport method that transmits text
   on a character by character, word by word, or other small chunk
   basis.


4.  Real-time preview presentation method

   The presentation method described here is intended to give a
   convenient view of a text conversation between two or more
   participants in a session.  It is intended to be compatible with the
   requirements of ITU-T T.140 [1], and to look familiar for text chat
   users and be feasible to implement in terminals with small displays.
   The basic concept however could be implemented in other text
   technologies as well and displayed in different ways.  ITU-T T.140
   [1], Appendix I, describes a traditional chat view and a two-column
   view.  The display formats shall be implemented so that terminals in
   a session can implement different display views meeting the
   requirements of T.140 [1] and giving the users a synchronized view of
   the flow of the conversation.

4.1.  Entries in creation

   Entries in creation are usually displayed in a separate real-time
   preview area, one for each participant for whom real-time preview is
   activated.  The real-time preview areas may be placed under the list
   of completed entries or at any other suitable place in the user
   interface.  If video from the participants is also displayed, then it
   may be suitable to display the real-time preview areas under the
   video image of the participant.  The real-time text could also be
   displayed in a manner more closely associated with earlier exchanged
   text entries in the session.

Internet-Draft  Text conversation with real-time preview     August 2007


4.2.  Completion of entry

   Text is entered in the real-time preview window, until an end-of-
   entry event occurs or another "post what I have so far" condition is
   met (such as a certain number of characters, or a pause in typing, or
   a delimiting character such as comma, or a turn-taking token).  Then
   the completed entry is moved to the display window.
   During entry, the following actions may be requested:
   o  Alert.  Requests alerting of the remote participant.
   o  Erase last character.  Erases the last entered character.
   o  Request to turn Real-time Preview on/off.

4.3.  Order of entries

   The order of displayed entries in the display area is the timing
   order when the entries were "posted" to the display from the preview
   area.

4.4.  Scrolling and buffering

   When there are entries scrolled out of the window, it is possible to
   scroll them back within a practical limit.  When scrolled, the view
   stays showing that position until scrolling is changed again or
   (optionally) a new entry is transmitted.  When scrolled so that the
   last entry is within view, or (optionally) a new entry is
   transmitted, the display continues showing new entries.

4.5.  Moving between different states

   Three states are defined for an entry.  It can be in active state,
   displayed state or hidden state.
   It is in active state while it is being produced.  It may then be
   displayed in the real-time preview area.
   An end of entry event takes it out of active state, normally to
   displayed state.
   An entry can become hidden by scrolling off screen, or by user
   command.
   (e.g.  Hide all but "Mary" to make it easier to see her thread)

4.6.  Reasons to finish an entry

   The default end of entry action is a new line request from the user.

   It is possible to add other end of entry actions to the logic.
   A list of possible options that could be extended after experience
   could be:





Hellstrom, et al.       Expires February 27, 2008               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  Text conversation with real-time preview     August 2007


   o  Long inactivity ( e.g. 30 seconds ), to ease interaction with
      Instant messaging systems.
   o  Full stop "." followed by short inactivity (e.g. 7 seconds), for
      more flow.
   o  Letters "GA" or "GASK" or "SKSK" followed by short inactivity
      (e.g. 7 seconds), for interaction with TTY users.
   o  Character "+" or "x" followed by short inactivity (e.g. 7
      seconds), for European textphone users.
   o  Character "*" followed by short inactivity (e.g. 7 seconds), for
      Northern Europe textphone users.

   White spaces (space bar, New line, CR, and LF) after those characters
   should be accepted and included in the finished entry.  (Some users
   do type a space character after the turntaking indicator and some
   textphones will send return after the turntaking symbol).

4.7.  Erasure

   Erasure is only done from the last character entered.  For text
   presentation methods allowing erasure over the ending border of the
   entry, erasure shall be allowed to reach entries already moved to
   display state.  When used with transport methods not allowing erasure
   over entry borders, the erasing user shall be provided feedback when
   erasure is no longer possible.  An entry can be moved back from
   display state to active state by erasure of the last character in the
   entry.  When erasing, it is important to perform the erasing action
   strictly according to the rules above, in order to maintain a
   synchronized view of the conversation for the participants, even if
   conversation participants use different display formats, such as the
   two-panel mode described in ITU-T T.140 1 [1] and the real-time
   preview mode described here.

4.8.  Moving between states

   An entry can be moved back and forth between hidden state and display
   state by different actions:
   o  Scrolling by new entries coming.
   o  Scrolling by the user.
   o  Changing font size or window size.
   o  Hiding or showing entries from a participant ( most relevant in a
      multi-party call )

4.9.  Display formatting

   The display shall be word-wrapped within the limits of the window.

   The labels on the entries should display the user name of the
   participant.  If this information is not available, labels indicating



Hellstrom, et al.       Expires February 27, 2008               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  Text conversation with real-time preview     August 2007


   "Received" and "Transmitted" or other suitable names for the
   participants should be used.

   The following operations shall be possible to do:
   o  Select font size
   o  Select text colour and background colour for each participant.
   o  Set window size
   o  Select between IM with preview mode and other modes.

   The real-time preview display area may follow the same display
   formatting regarding font size, colours etc as the display area or
   may be different.

   Each real-time preview window may have a fixed or adjustable size and
   its own scrolling mechanism.


5.  Transport and presentation considerations

   It is recommended to buffer characters in 300 ms intervals on the
   transport level.  It is permissible to buffer characters for
   transmission in up to 1 second intervals.  Display of received chunks
   of text shall be done with a slight time delay for each character so
   that adding a chunk of text to the real-time preview window
   approximately covers the transmission interval to give a smoother
   flow.
   It shall be possible to select participants in a multi-party
   situation for whom text is displayed, while text entries from others
   are hidden.
   The presentation method can be used with transport methods for real-
   time text and for all text message methods where it is possible to
   use timer based transmission to transmit fragments of message
   entries.

   The method is designed in order to be usable for real-time text
   conversation with coding and presentation according to ITU-T T.140
   including its amendment 1 [1], and IETF RTP [3] transport with
   packetization as defined in RFC 4103 [2].  These coding, presentation
   and transport specifications SHOULD be used whenever there is no
   strong reason to follow other specifications.

   An example of another environment where the real-time text with
   preview presentation is feasible, is with the messaging protocol IETF
   MSRP [4], where the message fragment concept can be used for a
   pseudo-real-time transmission and presentation according to the
   description in this specification.

Internet-Draft  Text conversation with real-time preview     August 2007


6.  Multi-party calls

   When implemented in an environment that supports multi-party calls,
   it may be felt less important to maintain a real-time preview view of
   text from all participants.  It may be very important for some
   participants to have rapid real-time preview presentation of selected
   participants.  Thus it may be desirable to be able to turn on or off
   the preview presentation per user.  When turning off real-time
   preview from one participant, its presentation disappears from the
   preview window, and text is entered entry by entry as they are
   finished for that participant.


7.  Alerting

   In order to be useful for hearing impaired, deaf and deaf-blind users
   as well as all situations with all users, it is important to provide
   audible, visual and, where possible, tactile alerting from events in
   the text conversation application.
   It should be possible for a user to get external alerting signals
   with a method preferred by the user.  It may for example be
   vibration, light flashes or sound as selected by the user.  It should
   also be possible to get alerting on the screen at certain events.
   The signals to external alerting systems should be issued when an
   incoming request for session initiation is received.  When the method
   is used in connection with T.140 [1] presentation, it should also be
   issued when the alert-in-session T.140 control event is received.
   For minor events, for example when an entry from a user is completed
   and displayed in the conversation display area, it is helpful to give
   an indication by an on-screen flashing.  Such flashing shall be
   avoided when the reason for flashing is on the window that has focus.
   It may be useful to provide external alerting also for these minor
   events also in specific situations.  If the user has not touched the
   application for a number of minutes when the minor event occurs it
   may be of interest to get an external alert.  Details of such
   arrangements are outside the scope of this document.


8.  IANA Considerations

   None.


9.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not introduce any procedures that change
   security issues from what is already specified for the session and
   transport environment where the presentation method is applied.
