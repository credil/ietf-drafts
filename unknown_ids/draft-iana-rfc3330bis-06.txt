Internet-Draft         Special Use IPv4 Addresses          February 2009


1.  Introduction

   Throughout its history, the Internet has employed a central Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) responsible for the allocation and
   assignment of various identifiers needed for the operation of the
   Internet [RFC1174].  In the case of the IPv4 address space, the IANA
   allocates parts of the address space to Regional Internet Registries
   (RIRs) according to their established needs.  These RIRs are
   responsible for the registration of IPv4 addresses to operators and
   users of the Internet within their regions.

   On an ongoing basis, the IANA has been designated by the IETF to make
   assignments in support of the Internet Standards Process [RFC2860].
   Section 5 of this document describes that assignment process.

   Small portions of the IPv4 address space have been allocated or
   assigned directly by the IANA for global or other specialized
   purposes.  These allocations and assignments have been documented in
   a variety of RFCs and other documents.  This document is intended to
   collect these scattered references and provide a current list of
   special use IPv4 addresses.

   This document is a revision of RFC 3330 [RFC3330], which it
   obsoletes; its primary purpose is to re-publish the technical content
   of RFC 3330 mostly unchanged as an Informational RFC.


2.  Terminology

   The terms "Specification Required", "Expert Review", "IESG Approval",
   "IETF Review", and "Standards Action", are used in this memo to refer
   to the processes described in [RFC5226].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].


3.  Differences between this document and RFC 3330

   Address blocks that were reserved for a special purpose in RFC 3330
   but are no longer reserved for any special purpose and are available
   for allocation are no longer listed in Sections 4 or 5.  The
   following blocks have become available:

   - 14.0.0.0/8 is no longer set aside for assignments to the
   international system of Public Data Networks [RFC1700], page 181.  It
   is now available for allocation to RIRs in the normal way;

Internet-Draft         Special Use IPv4 Addresses          February 2009


   - 24.0.0.0/8 is no longer listed as the addresses in that block have
   been managed by the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) in
   the normal way since 2001;

   - 39.0.0.0/8 is no longer listed as it has been subject to allocation
   to an RIR for assignment in the normal manner since 2001;

   - 128.0.0.0/16 is not reserved and is subject to future allocation by
   a Regional Internet Registry for assignment in the normal manner;

   - 191.255.0.0/16 is not reserved and is subject to future allocation
   by a RIR for assignment in the normal manner; and

   - 223.255.255.0/24 is not reserved and is subject to future
   allocation by an RIR for assignment in the normal manner.


4.  Global and Other Specialized Address Blocks

   0.0.0.0/8 - Addresses in this block refer to source hosts on "this"
   network.  Address 0.0.0.0/32 may be used as a source address for this
   host on this network; other addresses within 0.0.0.0/8 may be used to
   refer to specified hosts on this network [RFC1122], page 30.

   10.0.0.0/8 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  Addresses within this
   block SHOULD NOT appear on the public Internet and can be used
   without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   127.0.0.0/8 - This block is assigned for use as the Internet host
   loopback address.  A datagram sent by a higher level protocol to an
   address anywhere within this block should loop back inside the host.
   This is ordinarily implemented using only 127.0.0.1/32 for loopback,
   and addresses within this block SHOULD NOT appear on any network
   anywhere [RFC1122], page 31.

   169.254.0.0/16 - This is the "link local" block.  As described in
   [RFC3927], it is allocated for communication between hosts on a
   single link.  Hosts obtain these addresses by auto-configuration,
   such as when a DHCP server cannot be found.

   172.16.0.0/12 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  Addresses within this
   block SHOULD NOT appear on the public Internet and can be used
   without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   192.0.0.0/24 - This block is reserved for IETF protocol assignments.

Internet-Draft         Special Use IPv4 Addresses          February 2009


   192.0.2.0/24 - This block is assigned as "TEST-NET" for use in
   documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction with
   domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol
   documentation.  Addresses within this block SHOULD NOT appear on the
   public Internet and can be used without any coordination with IANA or
   an Internet registry.

   192.88.99.0/24 - This block is allocated for use as 6to4 relay
   anycast addresses, according to [RFC3068].

   192.168.0.0/16 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  Addresses within this
   block SHOULD NOT appear on the public Internet and can be used
   without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   198.18.0.0/15 - This block has been allocated for use in benchmark
   tests of network interconnect devices.  [RFC2544] explains that this
   range was assigned to minimize the chance of conflict in case a
   testing device were to be accidentally connected to part of the
   Internet.  Packets with source addresses from this range are not
   meant to be forwarded across the Internet.

   224.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class D address
   space, is allocated for use in IPv4 multicast address assignments.
   The IANA guidelines for assignments from this space are described in
   [RFC3171].

   240.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class E address
   space, is reserved.  The "limited broadcast" destination address
   255.255.255.255 SHOULD NOT be forwarded outside the local network of
   the source.  The remainder of this space is reserved for future use.
   See [RFC1112], page 2.

6.  Assignments of IPv4 Blocks for New Specialized Uses

   The IANA has responsibility for making assignments of protocol
   parameters used in the Internet according to the requirements of the
   "Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority" [RFC2860].  Among other things,
   [RFC2860] requires that protocol parameters be assigned according to
   the criteria and procedures specified in RFCs, including Proposed,
   Draft, and full Internet Standards and Best Current Practice
   documents, and any other RFC that calls for IANA assignment.

   The domain name and IP address spaces involve policy issues (in
   addition to technical issues) so that the requirements of [RFC2860]
   do not apply generally to those spaces.  Nonetheless, the IANA is
   responsible for ensuring assignments of IPv4 addresses as needed in
   support of the Internet Standards Process.  When a portion of the
   IPv4 address space is specifically required by an RFC, the technical
   requirements (e.g., size, prefix length) for the portion should be
   described [RFC5226].  Immediately before the RFC is published, the
   IANA will, in consultation with the Regional Internet Registries,
   make the necessary assignment and notify the RFC Editor of the
   particulars for inclusion in the RFC as published.

   As required by [RFC2860], the IANA will also make necessary
   experimental assignments of IPv4 addresses, also in consultation with
   the Regional Internet Registries.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes the IANA's past and current practices and
   does not create any new requirements for assignments or allocations
   by the IANA.


8.  Security Considerations

   The particular assigned values of special-use IPv4 addresses
   cataloged in this document do not directly raise security issues.
   However, the Internet does not inherently protect against abuse of
   these addresses; if you expect (for instance) that all packets from
   the 10.0.0.0/8 block originate within your subnet, all border routers
   should filter such packets that originate from elsewhere.  Attacks
   have been mounted that depend on the unexpected use of some of these
   addresses.


9.  Acknowledgments

   Many people have made comments on draft versions of this document.
   The IANA would especially like to thank Scott Bradner, Randy Bush,
   Harald Alvestrand and Alfred Hoenes for their constructive feedback
   and comments.
