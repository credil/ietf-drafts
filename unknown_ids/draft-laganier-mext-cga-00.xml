	The standard RFC 3775 mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates
	sent by a Mobile Node to its Home Agent relies on the use of a pair of
	unidirectional IPsec security associations between these two nodes.
	The standard mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates sent by a
	Mobile Node to one of its Correspondent Nodes relies on the use of a
	return routability test that involves the Correspondent Node verifying
	reachability of the Mobile Node at both its Home Address and its
	Care-of Address. The mechanism also requires the correspondent node to
	send keying material to both of these addresses.	

</t>

<t>

	RFC 4866 specifies a standard track mecanism that allows a Mobile Node
	that has configured a Cryptographically Generated Address (RFC 3972) as
	its Home Address to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates sent its
	Correspondent Nodes based on the properties of its Cryptographically
	Generated Addresses. Note that Cryptographically Generated Addresses
	have also been used to counter similar security issues in the context
	of SHIM6 (RFC 5533) and Secure Neighbor Discovery (RFC 3971.)

	<t> 

		The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
		NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
		"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
		in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

<section title="Terminology">

	<t>

		Other terms used throughout this document are defined in the
		relevant documents: <xref target="RFC3775"/>, <xref
			target="RFC4866"/>, <xref target="RFC3972"/>.

</section>

<section title="Usage Scenario">

	<t>

		The mechanism described herein is useful in situations where
		there is a desire not to depend on IPsec for protection of the
		Mobile IPv6 signaling between the Mobile Node and the Home Agent.

 </t>

</section>

<section title="Mobile Node Operation">

	<t>

		A Mobile Node creates and updates a Binding with its Home Agent
		by sending a Binding Update to its Home Agent. The Binding
		Update MUST include:

		<list style="symbols"> 

			<t>a monotically increasing Sequence Number as per <xref target="RFC3775"/>.</t>
			<t>a CGA Parameters option for the Cryptographically Generated Home Address of the Mobile Node as per <xref target="RFC4866"/>.</t>

			<t>a Timestamp option as per <xref target="RFC5213"/>.</t>

			<t>an Alternate Care-of Address option as per <xref target="RFC3775"/>.</t>
			<t>a Signature option as per <xref target="RFC4866"/>.</t>

		</list>
	</t>

</section>

<section title="Home Agent Operation">
	<t>

		A Home Agent MUST accept a Binding Update from a Mobile Node
		and maintain accordingly the corresponding Binding Cache Entry
		if the Binding Update includes all of the following:

		<list style="symbols"> 

			<t>a valid Sequence Number <xref target="RFC3775"/>. That is, if there is no existing Binding Cache Entry and the Timestamp is valid, the Sequence Number is accepted and recorded in the Binding Cache Entry. If there exists a Binding Cache Entry, the Sequence Number MUST be greater than the value recorded in the Binding Cache Entry.</t>

			<t>a CGA Parameters option for the Cryptographically Generated Home Address of the Mobile Node as per <xref target="RFC4866"/>.</t>

			<t>a valid Timestamp option <xref target="RFC5213"/>.
				That is, if there is no existing Binding Cache
				Entry, the time offset between the Timestamp and
				local Home Agent clock is recorded in the
				Binding Cache Entry. If there exists a Binding
				Cache Entry, the Timestamp MUST not differ from
				the local Home Agent clock for more than 1.5
				times the time offset recorded in the Binding
				Cache Entry.</t>

			<t>an Alternate Care-of Address option as per <xref target="RFC3775"/>.</t>
			<t>a valid Signature option as per <xref target="RFC4866"/>.</t>

		</list>
