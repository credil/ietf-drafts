       OSPF Protocol Extensions for Boundary Node Discovery (BND)
                draft-dhody-pce-bn-discovery-ospf-00

Abstract

   There are various circumstances where it is highly desirable to be
   able to dynamically and automatically discover a set of Boundary
   Nodes (BN) along with their domain information.  For that purpose,
   this document defines extensions to the Open Shortest Path First
   (OSPF) routing protocol for the advertisement of Boundary Node (BN)
   Discovery information within an OSPF area or within the entire OSPF
   routing domain.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines extensions to OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3
   [RFC5340] to allow a boundary node in an OSPF routing domain to
   advertise its location, along with domain information.

   Generic capability advertisement mechanisms for OSPF are defined in
   [RFC4970].  These allow a router to advertise its capabilities within
   an OSPF area or an entire OSPF routing domain.  This document
   leverages this generic capability advertisement mechanism to fully
   satisfy the dynamic BN discovery.

   This document defines a new TLV (named the Boundary Node Discovery
   TLV (BND TLV)) to be carried within the OSPF Router Information LSA
   ([RFC4970]).

   The Boundary Node information advertised is detailed in Section 3.
   Protocol extensions and procedures are defined in Sections 6 and 7.

   The OSPF extensions defined in this document allow for Boundary Node
   discovery within an OSPF routing domain.  Boundary Node can be an ABR
   or ASBR.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   ABR:  OSPF Area Border Router.  Routers used to connect two IGP
      areas.

   AS:  Autonomous System.

   ASBR:  Autonomous System Border Router.  Router used to connect
      together ASes of the same or different service providers via one
      or more inter-AS links

   BN:  A boundary node is either an ABR in the context of inter-area
      Traffic Engineering or an ASBR in the context of inter-AS Traffic
      Engineering.

   BND:  Boundary Node Discovery

   BRPC:  Backward Recursive Path Computation

   Domain:  Any collection of network elements within a common sphere of
      address management or path computational responsibility.  Examples
      of domains include Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas and
      Autonomous Systems (ASs).

   IGP:  Interior Gateway Protocol.  Either of the two routing
      protocols, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Intermediate System
      to Intermediate System (IS-IS).

   LSA:  Link State Advertisement.

   OSPF:  Open Shortest Path First.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   TLV:  Type-Length-Variable data encoding.

3.  Overview

3.1.  Boundary Node (BN) Discovery Information

   The BN discovery information is composed of:

   o  The BN location: an IPv4 and/or IPv6 address that is used to reach
      the BN.  It is RECOMMENDED to use an address that is always
      reachable from all connected domains;

   o  The set of two or more Domain(s) into which the BN has
      connectivity;

   Changes in BN discovery information may occur as a result of BN
   configuration update or domain status change.

3.2.  Flooding Scope

   The flooding scope for BN information advertised through OSPF can be
   limited to OSPF area(s) the BN belongs to, or can be extended across
   the entire OSPF routing domain.

4.  Applications

   BRPC procedure as defined in [RFC5441], requires Path Computation
   Element (PCE)[RFC4655] to be aware of the BNs for the inter-domain
   path computation.  As shown in the figure below, Incase of OSPF
   Area0, configuration of BNs at PCE5 is extensive.  BRPC procedure
   guarantees a best path only if BNs are selected correctly, any change
   in BNs at run time may lead to sub-optimal path.  Also Administrator
   need to configure ABR / ASBR ID in such a way that it is reachable
   from all the domains, BND Tlv can take care of this automatically.

5.  Existing Mechanisms

   o  E bit and B bit of Router LSA defined in [RFC2328] can help in
      finding a router acting as ABR/ASBR but there is no way to find
      out the domain information of this ABR/ASBR.  As stated in section
      4,Selection of correct BN is based on domain and thus it is
      ineffective.

   o  [RFC5392] specifies how to advertise TE properties of inter-AS
      links; through which ASBR and remote AS can be discovered, but ABR
      and their domain information cannot be discovered via above RFC.

   o  Any assumptions on area-id for the ABRs based on generic OSPF area
      topology can be inaccurate; specially considering IBM
      interpretation of ABR [RFC3509]

   o  Section 4 of [H-PCE] specifies each child PCE should know the
      identity of the domains that neighbor its own domain and
      advertises the same to the parent PCE.  No method exist to find
      the neighbor domain which need to be carried in NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN
      Sub-TLV and BN discovery along with neighbor domain information
      can help in generating NEIG-PCE-DOMAIN Sub-TLV.

6.  The OSPF BND TLV

   The OSPF BN Discovery TLV (BND TLV) contains a non-ordered set of
   sub-TLVs.

   The format of the OSPF BND TLV and its sub-TLVs is identical to the
   TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to
   OSPF[RFC3630].  That is, the TLV is composed of 2 octets for the
   type, 2 octets specifying the TLV length, and a value field.  The
   Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets.

   The OSPF BND TLV has the following format:

                        1                   2                   3

      Length:   Variable
      Value:    This comprises of following sub-TLVs

      Two sub-TLVs are defined:
            Sub-TLV type  Length            Name
                  1      variable     BN-ADDRESS sub-TLV
                  2         4         BN-DOMAIN sub-TLV

   The BN-ADDRESS and BN-DOMAIN sub-TLVs MUST always be present within
   the BND TLV.

   Malformed BND TLVs or sub-TLVs not explicitly described in this
   document MUST cause the LSA to be treated as malformed according to
   the normal procedures of OSPF.

   Any unrecognized sub-TLV MUST be silently ignored.

   The BND TLV is carried within an OSPF Router Information LSA defined
   in [RFC4970].

   The following sub-sections describe the sub-TLVs which are carried
   within the BND TLV.

6.1.  BN-ADDRESS Sub-TLV

   The BN-ADDRESS sub-TLV specifies an IP address that can be used to
   reach the BN.  It is RECOMMENDED to make use of an address that is
   always reachable, provided that the BN is alive and reachable.

   The BN-ADDRESS sub-TLV is mandatory; it MUST be present within the
   BND TLV.  It MAY appear twice, when the BN has both an IPv4 and IPv6
   address.  It MUST NOT appear more than once for the same address
   type.  If it appears more than once for the same address type, only
   the first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be ignored.

   The format of the BN-ADDRESS sub-TLV is as follows:

6.2.  BN-DOMAIN Sub-TLV

   The BN-DOMAIN sub-TLV specifies a BN-Domain (area or AS) where the BN
   has topology connectivity.

   The BN-DOMAIN sub-TLV is mandatory; it MUST be present within the BND
   TLV.

   A BND TLV MUST include two or more BN-DOMAIN sub-TLVs as the BN has
   connectivity into multiple BN-Domains.

   The BN-DOMAIN sub-TLV has the following format:

       Type:     2
       Length:   8

       Two domain-type values are defined:
                     1   OSPF Area ID
                     2   AS Number

   Domain ID: With the domain-type set to 1, this indicates the 32-bit
   Area ID of an area where the BN (ABR) has connectivity.  With domain-
   type set to 2, this indicates an AS number of an AS where the BN
   (ASBR) has connectivity.  When the AS number is coded in two octets,
   the AS Number field MUST have its first two octets set to 0.

7.  Elements of Procedure

   The BND TLV is advertised within OSPFv2 Router Information LSAs
   (Opaque type of 4 and Opaque ID of 0) or OSPFv3 Router Information
   LSAs (function code of 12), which are defined in [RFC4970].  As such,
   elements of procedure are inherited from those defined in [RFC4970].

   In OSPFv2, the flooding scope is controlled by the opaque LSA type(as
   defined in [RFC5250]) and in OSPFv3, by the S1/S2 bits (as defined in
   [RFC5340]).  If the flooding scope is area local, then the BND TLV
   MUST be carried within an OSPFv2 type 10 router information LSA or an
   OSPFV3 Router Information LSA with the S1 bit set and the S2 bit
   clear.  If the flooding scope is the entire IGP domain, then the BND
   TLV MUST be carried within an OSPFv2 type 11 Router Information LSA
   or OSPFv3 Router Information LSA with the S1 bit clear and the S2 bit
   set.

   When the BN function is deactivated, the OSPF speaker MUST originate
   a new Router Information LSA that no longer includes the
   corresponding BND TLV, provided there are other TLVs in the LSA.  If
   there are no other TLVs in the LSA, it MUST either send an empty
   Router Information LSA or purge it by prematurely aging it.

Internet-Draft                  OSPF BND                       June 2010


   The BN address (i.e., the address indicated within the BN-ADDRESS
   sub-TLV) SHOULD be reachable via some prefixes advertised by OSPF.

   The BND TLV information regarding a specific BN is only considered
   current and useable when the router advertising this information is
   itself reachable via OSPF calculated paths in the same area of the
   LSA in which the BND TLV appears.

   A change in the state of a BN (activate, deactivate, domain change)
   MUST result in a corresponding change in the BND TLV information
   advertised by an OSPF router (inserted, removed, updated)in its LSA.
   The way BNs determine the information they advertise, and how that
   information is made available to OSPF, is out of the scope of this
   document.  Some information may be configured and other information
   may be automatically determined by the OSPF.

   A change in information in the BND TLV MUST NOT trigger any SPF
   computation at a receiving router.

8.  Backward Compatibility

   The BND TLV defined in this document does not introduce any
   interoperability issues.

   A router not supporting the BND TLV will just silently ignore the TLV
   as specified in [RFC4970].

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  OSPF TLV

   IANA has defined a registry for TLVs carried in the Router
   Information LSA defined in [RFC4970].A number of IANA considerations
   have been highlighted in previous sections of this document.  IANA is
   requested to make the following allocations.

   Value      TLV Name                      Reference
   -----     --------                       ----------
   To be        BND                        (this document)
   assigned
   by IANA

10.  Security Considerations

   This document defines OSPF extensions for BN discovery within an
   administrative domain.  Hence the security of the BN discovery relies
   on the security of OSPF.

   Mechanisms defined to ensure authenticity and integrity of OSPF LSAs
   [RFC2154], and their TLVs, can be used to secure the BN Discovery
   information as well.

   OSPF provides no encryption mechanism for protecting the privacy of
   LSAs and, in particular, the privacy of the BN discovery information.

11.  Manageability Considerations

   TBD
