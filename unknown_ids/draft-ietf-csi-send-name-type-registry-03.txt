                     SEND Name Type field Registry
               draft-ietf-csi-send-name-type-registry-03

Abstract

   SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) defines the Name Type field in the
   Trust Anchor option.  This document request to IANA the creation and
   management of a registry for this field.  This document also
   specifies a new Name Type field based on a certificate Subject Key
   Identifier (SKI).

2.  Introduction

   SEcure Neighbor Discovery [RFC3971] (SEND) utilizes X.509v3
   certificates that include the [RFC3779] extension for IPv6 addresses
   to certify a router authority over an IPv6 prefix for NDP (Neighbor
   Discovery Protocol).  The Trust Anchor Option in section 6.4.3 of RFC
   3971 allows the identification of the Trust Anchor (TA) selected by
   the host.  In that same section, two name types were defined: the DER
   Encoded X.501 Name and a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).  This
   document request to IANA the creation and management of a registry
   for this field.

   In any Public Key Infrastructure, the subject name of a certificate
   is only unique within each CA.  Consequently, a new option to
   identify TAs across CAs is needed.

   In [I-D.ietf-csi-send-cert] the certificate profile described in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-res-certs] is adopted for SEND.  In these documents,
   the Subject field in the certificates are declared to be meaningless
   and the subjectAltName field is not allowed.  On the other hand, the
   Subject Key Identifier (SKI) extension for the X.509 certificates is
   defined as mandatory and non-critical.

   This document specifies a new Name Type field in the SEND TA option
   that allows to use of the SKI X.509 extension to identify TA X.509
   certificates.

3.  SEND SKI trust anchor option Name Type field.

   Name Type

   3 SHA-1 Subject Key Identifier (SKI)

   The Key Identifier used here is the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the value
   of the DER-encoded ASN.1 bit string of the subject public key, as
   described in Section 4.2.1.2 of [RFC5280].

3.1.  Processing Rules for Routers

   As specified in RFC 3971, a TA is identified by the SEND TA option.
   If the TA option is represented as a SHA-1 SKI, then the SKI must be
   equal to the SKI extension in the trust anchor's certificate
   calculated as described in [draft-ietf-sidr-res-certs-17].  The
   router SHOULD include the TA option(s) in the advertisement for which
   the certification path was found.  Also, following [RFC3971]
   specification, if the router is unable to find a path to the
   requested anchor, it SHOULD send an advertisement without any
   certificate.  In this case, the router SHOULD include the TA options
   that were solicited.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create and maintain a new registry entitled
   "SEND Name Type field in ICMP TA option".  This registry records Name
   Type fields for the ICMP Trust Anchor option (15) defined in the RFC
   3971.

   The initial values for the "SEND Name Type field in ICMP TA option"
   registry are:

       +---------+------------------------------------------------+
       | Value   | Description                                    |
       +---------+------------------------------------------------+
       | 0       | Reserved                                       |
       |         |                                                |
       | 1       | DER Encoded X.501 Name (RFC 3971)              |
       |         |                                                |
       | 2       | FQDN (RFC 3971)                                |
       |         |                                                |
       | 3       | SHA-1 Subject Key Identifier (SKI) (Section 3) |
       |         |                                                |
       | 253-254 | Experimental use                               |
       |         |                                                |
       | 255     | Reserved                                       |
       +---------+------------------------------------------------+
