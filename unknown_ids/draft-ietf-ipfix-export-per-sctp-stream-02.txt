     Abstract 

        This document specifies an improvement to the PR-SCTP 
        export specified in the IPFIX specifications in RFC5101. 
        This method offers several advantages such as the ability to 
        calculate Data Record losses for PR-SCTP, immediate export of 
        Template Withdrawal Messages, immediate reuse of Template IDs 
        within an SCTP stream, and reduced demands on the Collecting 
        Process.

     1. Terminology 

        IPFIX-specific terminology used in this document is defined 
        in section 2 of [RFC5101].  As in [RFC5101], these IPFIX-
        specific terms have the first letter of a word capitalized 
        when used in this document. 
         
        Template Reuse Delay  
         
           The time the Exporting Process MUST wait after sending the 
           last Data Set described by a given Template before sending a 
           Template Withdrawal Message for the Template.  [RFC5101] 
           specifies a default value of 5 seconds. 
         

     1.1. IPFIX Documents Overview 

        The IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101] provides network administrators 
        with access to IP Flow information. 
         
        The architecture for the export of measured IP Flow 
        information out of an IPFIX Exporting Process to a Collecting 
        Process is defined in the IPFIX Architecture [IPFIX-ARCH], 
        per the requirements defined in RFC 3917 [RFC3917]. 
         
        The IPFIX Architecture [IPFIX-ARCH] specifies how IPFIX Data 
        Records and Templates are carried via a congestion-aware 
        transport protocol from IPFIX Exporting Processes to IPFIX 
        Collecting Processes. 
         
        IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX Information Elements, 
        their name, type and additional semantic information, as 
        specified in the IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102].   
         
        Finally the IPFIX Applicability Statement [IPFIX-AS] 
        describes what type of applications can use the IPFIX 
        protocol and how they can use the information provided.  It 
        furthermore shows how the IPFIX framework relates to other 
        architectures and frameworks.  
         
     1.2. PSAMP Documents Overview 

        The document "A Framework for Packet Selection and Reporting" 
        [PSAMP-FMWK], describes the PSAMP framework for network 
        elements to select subsets of packets by statistical and 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires July 21, 2009            [Page 4] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    January 2009 
         

        other methods, and to export a stream of reports on the 
        selected packets to a collector. 
         
        The set of packet selection techniques (sampling, filtering, 
        and hashing) supported by PSAMP are described in "Sampling 
        and Filtering Techniques for IP Packet Selection" [PSAMP-
        TECH]. 
         
        The PSAMP protocol [PSAMP-PROTO] specifies the export of 
        packet information from a PSAMP Exporting Process to a PSAMP 
        Collecting Process.  Like IPFIX, PSAMP has a formal 
        description of its information elements, their name, type and 
        additional semantic information.  The PSAMP information model 
        is defined in [PSAMP-INFO]. 
         
        Finally [PSAMP-MIB] describes the PSAMP Management 
        Information Base. 
         

     2. Introduction 

        The IPFIX working group has specified a protocol to export IP 
        Flow information [RFC5101].  This protocol is designed to 
        export information about IP traffic Flows and related 
        measurement data, where a Flow is defined by a set of key 
        attributes (e.g. source and destination IP address, source 
        and destination port, etc.).  However, thanks to its Template 
        mechanism, the IPFIX protocol can export any type of 
        information, as long as the relevant Information Element is 
        specified in the IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102], 
        registered with IANA, or specified as an enterprise-specific 
        Information Element. 
         
        The IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] specifies that IP traffic 
        measurements for Flows are exported using a TLV (type, 
        length, value) format.  The information is exported using a 
        Template Record that is sent once to export the {type, 
        length} pairs that define the data format for the Information 
        Elements in a Flow.  The Data Records specify values for each 
        Flow. 
         
        The IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] is flexible: it foresees the usage 
        of the multiple SCTP streams per association; it allows the 
        transmission of Data Sets, Template Sets, and/or Options 
        Template Sets on any stream; it offers the full or partial 
        reliability export of Data Sets; it proposes the ordered or out-
        of-order delivery of Data Sets.  However, due to bandwidth 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires July 21, 2009            [Page 5] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    January 2009 
         

        restrictions and packet losses in the network as well as 
        resource constraints on the Exporter and Collector (e.g., 
        limited buffer sizes), it is not always possible to export all 
        Data Sets in a reliable way. 
         
        This document specifies a method for exporting a Template Record 
        and its associated Data Sets in a single SCTP stream, limiting 
        each Template ID to a single stream if possible, and imposing 
        in-order transmission. 
      
        This method offers several advantages over IPFIX export as 
        specified in [RFC5101] such as the ability to calculate Data 
        Record losses for PR-SCTP, immediate export of Template 
        Withdrawal Messages, immediate reuse of Template IDs within an 
        SCTP stream, reduced likelihood of Data Record loss, and reduced 
        demands on the Collecting Process. 
      
         
     2.1. Relationship with IPFIX and PSAMP 

        The specification in this document applies to the IPFIX 
        protocol specifications [RFC5101].  However, it only applies 
        to the SCTP transport protocol [RFC4960] option of the IPFIX 
        protocol specifications, specifically in the case of the 
        partial reliability extension [RFC3758].  All specifications 
        from [RFC5101] apply unless specified otherwise in this 
        document. 
      
        As the Packet Sampling (PSAMP) protocol specifications 
        [PSAMP-PROTO] are based on the IPFIX protocol specifications, 
        the specifications in this document are also valid for the 
        PSAMP protocol.  Therefore, the method specified by this 
        document also applies to PSAMP. 
         
      
     2.2. Applicability 

        The specifications are required in cases where we must know how 
        many Data Records of a certain type (i.e. from a certain 
        Template) were lost.  A typical example is a router exporting 
        billing records.  Furthermore, they apply in cases where the 
        Exporter can not afford to export all the Flow Records reliably, 
        due to the limited resources to buffer the huge amount of flow 
        records.  Such situations may occur if Data Sets are generated 
        at a higher rate at the Exporter than can be transferred to the 
        Collector because of bandwidth limitations in the network or 
        slow reception at the Collector. 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires July 21, 2009            [Page 6] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    January 2009 
         

         
        To be more precise, the specification applicability is the case 
        where multiple Templates are simultaneously active within a 
        single SCTP Transport Session and the calculation of the Data 
        Record loss for a particular Template is required.  Indeed, with 
        the current IPFIX specifications [RFC5101], if an IPFIX Message 
        is lost (UDP or SCTP partially reliable), it is not possible to 
        determine to which Template of the Transport Session the lost 
        Data Records belong to. 
         
        Exporting Processes following this specification will 
        interoperate with existing Collecting Processes that comply with 
        [RFC5101]; no changes are required at the Collecting Process to 
        support this method.  This document introduces some additional 
        specifications for the Collection Process specified in 
        [RFC5101]. 
      
      
     2.3. Limitations 

        This method requires multiple SCTP streams in the association 
        between the Exporting and Collecting Process, ideally one per 
        Template.   
         
        In the future, the SCTP association may support the addition of 
        streams according to [SCTP-RESET] in order to handle the 
        transmission of additional Templates during the Transport 
        Session. 
         
        The SCTP Stream Reset functionality [SCTP-RESET] provides 
        applications the ability to dynamically reset the sequence 
        numbering of any existing stream(s) in an association, as well 
        as the ability to add new streams to an existing association.  A 
        new SCTP chunk type, Stream Reset, along with new SCTP 
        parameters to be used in the chunk are defined.  The Stream 
        Reset chunk contains one request type parameter, one response 
        type parameter, or one of each.  Each parameter contains a 
        request and/or response sequence number.  The sequence number is 
        used in case of retransmissions.  In the case of the add streams 
        functionality as specified in [SCTP-RESET], the Add Streams 
        parameter is used for requesting the addition of new streams 
        to the association.  When a sender wishes to increase the number 
        of outbound streams on the association, it will send a Stream 
        Reset chunk with the desired number of streams to be added.  The 
        receiver of the chunk will add the requested number of inbound 
        streams, if it can satisfy the request, and respond with a 
        Stream Reset chunk containing a Stream Reset Response parameter 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires July 21, 2009            [Page 7] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    January 2009 
         

        indicating a success.  The newly added streams will be appended 
        to the existing inbound stream numbers and initialized as 
        starting at stream sequence number zero.  The sender will 
        then add the desired number of outbound streams and can begin to 
        use the new streams.  If the receiver cannot add the requested 
        number of streams, it will respond with a Stream Reset chunk 
        with a Stream Reset Response parameter indicating a failure.  In 
        this case, no new streams will be added. 
         
        The case where no more free SCTP streams are available is 
        discussed in further details in the section 4.3 

     3. IPFIX Protocol Specifications Limitations and Improvements  

        For three specific topics (Data Record Loss per Template, 
        Transmission Order within a Stream, No Transmission Order across 
        SCTP Streams), this section explains the IPFIX protocol 
        specifications limitations on one hand, and the advantages of 
        the method specified in this document on the other hand.  
         
         
     3.1. Data Record Loss per Template 

     3.1.1. IPFIX Protocol Specifications Limitation 

        Section 6.3.2 of the Requirements for IP Flow Information 
        Export [RFC3917] discusses the data transfer reliability 
        issues.  "Loss of flow records during the data transfer from 
        the exporting process to the Collecting Process must be 
        indicated at the collecting process." is clearly mentioned.   
        However, in some cases, it may be important to know how many 
        Data Records of a certain type were lost (e.g., in the case 
        of billing), but conventionally IPFIX does not provide this 
        information. 
         
        A Collector can detect out-of-sequence, dropped, or duplicate 
        IPFIX Messages by tracking the Sequence Number [RFC5101].  
        Note that the Sequence Number field in the Export header 
        increases with the number of IPFIX Data Records within the 
        PR-SCTP stream.  
         
        The IPFIX protocol specification [RFC5101] specifies that Data 
        Records defined by any Template may be sent on any SCTP stream.  
        As such, if there is more than one Templates defined within the 
        whole SCTP association then there is no way of knowing which 
        Template any lost Data Records are associated with.  This is 
        true, no matter what convention the Exporting Process uses to 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires July 21, 2009            [Page 8] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    January 2009 
         

        send Data Records on different SCTP streams, as the protocol 
        makes no guarantees. 
         
        Using the specification in this document, it is guaranteed that 
        any lost Data Records will be associated only with the Templates 
        that are defined on that stream and by defining only one 
        Template on a stream it is ensured that any loss is associated 
        with that single Template. 
      
        Note that a workaround allowed by the IPFIX specifications 
        [RFC5101] is to use only one Template Record per SCTP Transport 
        Session, at the cost of multiplying the number of SCTP Transport 
        Sessions when multiple Template Records are required. 
      
         
     3.1.2. IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream Advantage 

        By exporting each Template and the corresponding Data Records 
        within a different stream, the loss pertaining to each specific 
        Template can be deduced from the Sequence Number field in the 
        IPFIX Message headers. 
         
         
     3.2. Transmission Order within a Stream 

     3.2.1. IPFIX Protocol Specifications Limitation 

        A Collecting Process must have received the Template Record 
        associated with the Data Records to be able to decode the 
        information in the Data Records.  The IPFIX protocol 
        specification foresees: 
         
           "The Exporting Process SHOULD transmit the Template Set 
           and Options Template Set in advance of any Data Sets that 
           use that (Options) Template ID, to help ensure that the 
           Collector has the Template Record before receiving the 
           first Data Record.", 
         
        The fact that the Collecting Process cannot decode the Data 
        Records without the corresponding Template Record may result in 
        the Data Records being discarded by the Collector, as specified 
        in [RFC5101]:  
         
           "The Collecting Process normally receives Template Records 
           from the Exporting Process before receiving Data Records.  
           The Data Records are then decoded and stored by the 
           Collector.  If the Template Records have not been received

           at the time Data Records are received, the Collecting 
           Process MAY store the Data Records for a short period of 
           time and decode them after the Template Records are 
           received."  
      
        In practice, Data Records without associated (Options) 
        Template Records will probably be discarded by the Collecting 
        Process. 
      
         
     3.2.2. IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream Advantages 

        By exporting each Template Record and the corresponding Data 
        Records within a single stream and imposing in-order 
        transmission, the Template Record will always arrive before 
        the associated Data Records.  Therefore, there is no risk 
        that the Collecting Process discards Data Records while 
        waiting for the Template Record to arrive. 
         
        Furthermore, when reusing a Template ID within a stream, the 
        Template Withdrawal Message will be guaranteed to arrive 
        before the new definition of the Template and therefore the 
        Template Record may be sent directly after the Template 
        Withdrawal Message.  In other words, the Template Reuse Delay 
        restriction (by default, 5 seconds, as specified in [RFC5101] 
        is removed for Template ID reuse within the same stream. 
         
        Another advantage with the new specifications in this 
        document reduces the load on the Collecting Process.  Indeed, 
        the Collecting Process doesn't have to store the Data Records 
        while waiting for the Template Records, as the transmission 
        order is always guaranteed.  This way, extra reliability of 
        the Data Records is achieved without extra burden on the 
        Collecting Process. 
         
         
     3.3. No Transmission Order across SCTP Streams 

     3.3.1. IPFIX Protocol Specifications Limitation 

        The fact that the protocol specifications [RFC5101] are 
        flexible in terms of stream(s) on which the Template Set, 
        Options Template Set, and corresponding Data Sets are 
        exported, implies that the (Options) Template Set might be 
        exported on a different stream than the corresponding Data 
        Sets.  This might cause Data Record loss in the Collecting 

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires July 21, 2009           [Page 10]

        Process as the ordered transmission across SCTP streams is 
        not guaranteed.  
      
        For example, a Template Record may be blocked pending 
        reliable transmission on one stream while the corresponding 
        Data Records may be transmitted immediately in another 
        stream.  Also, due to different stream congestion, it is 
        possible that even if the Template Record and corresponding 
        Data Records are sent reliably, Data Records sent on a 
        different stream than the Template Record might still arrive 
        before the Template Record.  
         
         
     3.3.2. IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream Advantages 

        By exporting each Template Record and the corresponding Data 
        Records within a single stream, imposing in-order 
        transmission, and limiting the Template to a single stream, 
        the issue of ordered transmission across multiple streams is 
        avoided.  
         
        By exporting all corresponding Data Records within the same 
        ordered stream as the Template Record, each stream is 
        independent and self-contained and the interaction between 
        streams is limited to that of options Data Record interactions.  
        This has several advantageous consequences, including the order 
        preservation that does not result in the blocking of unrelated 
        data and load reduction on the Collecting Process (as the 
        Template Records are guaranteed to be delivered before the 
        associated Data Records, there is no need for buffering of Data 
        Sets with missing Templates). 
         
         
     4. Specifications 

        This section introduces improvements compared to the IPFIX 
        specifications in [RFC5101].  These new specifications, which 
        are more specific compared to [RFC5101], are descried with the 
        key words described in [RFC2119]. 
         

     4.1. Template Management 

        This section introduces some more additional specifications 
        compared to the Template Management section 8 in [RFC5101].  
      

      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires July 21, 2009           [Page 11] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    January 2009 
         

        As specified in [RFC5101], Template Sets and Options Template 
        Sets MUST be sent reliably.   
         
        Any Data Sets associated with a Template Record MUST be sent on 
        the same stream on which the Template Record was sent. 
         
        The Exporter SHOULD send a single Template and corresponding 
        Data Sets within a single stream in order to enable calculation 
        of the potential Data Record loss for this Template.  However, 
        the Exporter MAY group related (Options) Templates and their 
        corresponding Data Sets within a single stream so that loss 
        statistics are calculated for the group.  This is suitable in 
        cases where there are only slight variations among the Templates 
        in a group, e.g. the omission of unavailable fields for export 
        efficiency, and may be necessary if the SCTP association does 
        not support enough streams to export each Template in its own 
        stream. 
      
        If a SCTP stream contains a mixture of Data Records defined by a 
        Template Record and Options Template Record(s), the Data Records 
        defined by the Options Template Record(s) SHOULD be sent 
        reliably within the same stream so that the Collector does not 
        consider any loss to be associated with the options Data 
        Records.  Indeed, if the Collector does not have the guarantee 
        that the options Data Record are sent reliably, the Collector 
        can not determine whether the loss in that stream belongs to the 
        Data Records defined by the Template Record, defined by the 
        Option Template Record (option Data Records), or by both of 
        them.  By sending the options Data Record reliably (which is 
        usually required to interpret the Data Records correctly), any 
        loss will be limited to the non-option Data Record and loss can 
        still be calculated on a per Template basis. 
         
        The Data Record Reliability Option Template is used to guarantee 
        to the Collector that the Data Records are sent reliably.  In 
        every SCTP stream, the Exporting Process MUST send a Data Record 
        defined by the Data Record Reliability Option Template for every 
        Template and every Option Template used on this stream (i.e., 
        for which Data Records are exported on this stream).  The Data 
        Record Reliability Option Template contains the following 
        Information Elements: 
      
         SCOPE:     Template ID  
         NOT-SCOPE: dataRecordsReliability

        The Data Record defined by the Data Record Reliability Option 
        Template MUST be sent reliably.  When the Data Record 
        Reliability Option Template and associated Data Records are sent 
        in the same SCTP stream, the first associated Data Record can 
        follow the Data Record Reliability Option Template immediately.  
        When the Data Record Reliability Option Template and associated 
        Data Records are sent in different SCTP streams, the Exporting 
        Process SHOULD transmit the Data Record Reliability Option 
        Template in advance of any Data Sets that use this Option 
        Template, to help ensure that the Collector has the Option 
        Template Record before receiving the first Data Record.  
         
         
     4.2. New Information Element 

        dataRecordsReliability 
         
           Description: 
                The Data Records reliability associated with this 
                Template ID.  The true value means that the Data Records 
                are sent reliably, while the false value means that the 
                Data Records are not sent reliably. 
                 
           Abstract Data Type: boolean 
           Data Type Semantics: identifier 
           ElementId: xxx 
           Status: current 
      
         
     4.3. SCTP 

        This section introduces some more specific specifications 
        compared to the "SCTP" section 10.2 (and subsections) in 
        [RFC5101].  More specifically the "Stream" section 10.2.4.3  
         
        PR-SCTP [RFC3758] MUST be implemented by all compliant 
        implementations. 
         
        All IPFIX Messages MUST be sent in order within a stream. 
      
        As specified in [RFC5101], depending on the requirements of the 
        application, the Exporting Process may send Data Sets with full 
        or partial reliability.   
         
        Unreliable data transfer MAY be used where the application does 
        not require reliable transmission or the use of a retransmission

        queue is impractical due to resource restrictions at the 
        Exporter. 
         
        If the Exporting Process requires to export a new Template 
        Record but there are no more free SCTP streams available, the 
        Exporting Process MUST add the Template Set and Data Records to 
        an existing stream at the cost of diluting the granularity of 
        Data Records loss.  The other alternative, which is not 
        practical in operational networks, is to restart the SCTP 
        association with an increased number of streams.  
        In the future, the Exporting Process may attempt to increase the 
        number of outbound streams it is able to send to, per [SCTP-
        RESET].  
      
         
     4.4. Template Withdrawal Message 

        This section introduces some more specific Template Withdrawal 
        Message-related specifications compared to [RFC5101]. 
         
        As specified in [RFC5101], Templates that are not used anymore 
        SHOULD be deleted.  Before reusing a Template ID, the Template 
        MUST be deleted.  In order to delete an allocated Template, the 
        Template is withdrawn through the use of a Template Withdrawal 
        Message.   
         
        The Template Withdrawal Message MUST be sent on the same stream 
        as the Template Record.  
         
        As the Template Withdrawal Message MUST be sent reliably, using 
        SCTP-ordered delivery per [RFC5101], and as all IPFIX Messages 
        are sent in order within a stream (per the specifications in 
        this document), the IPFIX Message containing the Template 
        Withdrawal Message will not arrive at the Collecting Process 
        before any associated and previously sent Data Record.  As a 
        consequence, no Data Records will be lost due to delayed arrival 
        at the Collector. 
      
        The Template ID from a withdrawn Template MAY be reused on the 
        same stream immediately after the Template Withdrawal Message is 
        sent.  This case is equivalent to the use of a Template Reuse 
        Delay value of 0. 
         
        After the new definition of the Template ID, the Exporting 
        Process MUST send the Data Record Reliability Option Template to 
        specify the reliability level of its corresponding Data Records.  
      
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires July 21, 2009           [Page 14] 
         
     Internet-Draft      <IPFIX Export per SCTP Stream>    January 2009 
         

        If the new definition of the Template ID is to be reused on a 
        different stream, the Template Withdrawal Message MUST NOT be 
        sent before the Template Reuse Delay.   
      
        A Template Withdrawal Message to withdraw all Templates for the 
        Observation Domain ID specified in the IPFIX Message header MUST 
        NOT be used.  
         
        Multiple Template IDs MAY be withdrawn with a single Template 
        Withdrawal Message at the condition that all the Template IDs in 
        the Template Withdrawal Message are used on the same SCTP 
        stream. 
      
         
     4.5. The Collecting Process's Side 

        This section introduces some more specific specifications to the 
        Collection Process compared to section 9 in [RFC5101].  However, 
        the new specifications are backwards compatible with RFC5101-
        compliant Collecting Processes. 
         
        As specified in [RFC5101], the Collecting Process SHOULD listen 
        for a new association request from the Exporting Process.  The 
        Exporting Process will request a number of streams to use for 
        export. 
         
        The number of requested streams SHOULD be equivalent to the 
        number of simultaneous Template Records used in the association.  
         
        In the future, a Collecting Process should support the procedure 
        for the addition of an SCTP stream [SCTP-RESET]. 
                       
        As specified in [RFC5101], the IPFIX protocol has a Sequence 
        Number field in the IPFIX Message header that increases with the 
        number of IPFIX Data Records in the IPFIX Message.  A Collector 
        may detect out-of-sequence, dropped, or duplicate IPFIX Messages 
        by tracking the Sequence Number.   
         
        When one or more sequential IPFIX Messages are considered lost, 
        the number of lost Data Records is equal to the Sequence Number 
        of the first IPFIX Message Header following the lost packets 
        (S2) minus the Sequence Number of the first lost IPFIX Message 
        (S1).  The Sequence Number of the first lost IPFIX Message can 
        be calculated as the Sequence Number of the last IPFIX Message 
        before the sequence of lost IPFIX Messages (S0) plus the number 
        of Data Records in that IPFIX Message (N0).

            S1   = S0 + N0  
            loss = S2 - S1 = S2 - (S0 + N0) 
         
        As this Sequence Number is per SCTP stream, the loss for the 
        Data Records sent in that stream can be calculated in case of 
        partially-reliable export. 
         
        If the Collecting Process receives a Template Withdrawal Message 
        on a different stream than the one on which the Template is 
        used, then the Collecting Process SHOULD log an error message. 
         
        The Collector can assume that the Exporter Transport Session  
        supports the specifications in this document if it receives in 
        every stream Data Records defined by the Data Record Reliability 
        Option Template for all Templates used in this stream. 
      
         
     5. Examples 

        Figure 1 shows an example where the stream 10 carries a Template 
        Record with the Template ID 256 transmitted with full 
        reliability (FR), together with associated Data Records 
        transmitted with partial reliability (PR).  The Data Record 
        Reliability Option Template with Template ID 257 is transmitted 
        with full reliability (FR).  Its corresponding Data Set contains 
        two Data Records. 
        Record 1:

        Note that, because all IPFIX Messages are sent in order within a 
        stream, the Template 256 will always be processed before the 
        Data Records by the Collecting Process. Therefore, the 
        Collecting Process job is simplified. Furthermore, the Data 
        Record loss for the Template 256 can easily be calculated on the 
        Collecting Process.  
          
         
        If an Option Template is necessary to understand the content of 
        a Data Record (i.e. the scope in the Options Template Record is 
        an Information Element contained in the Data Record), the 
        Options Template Record should be sent in the same stream, as 
        displayed in figure 2.

                                     Figure 2               
         
        Figure 2 shows an example where stream 20 carries:  
        -  the Data Record Reliability Option Template with Template ID 
           258, transmitted with full reliability (FR) 
        -  an Options Template Record with Template ID 259 transmitted 
           with full reliability.  This Options Template Record contains 
           additional information related to the subsequent Data Records 
           based on Template ID 260.  Typical examples are the Common 
           Properties information [IPFIX-RED-RED] or a selector report 
           interpretation [PSAMP-PROTO]. 
        -  the Template Record with Template ID 260, transmitted with 
           full reliability, along with the associated Data Records 
           transmitted with partial reliability (PR).    
        -  the Data Set specified by the Reliability Option Template 
           with Template ID 258 transmitted with full reliability.   
           The Data Set contains three Data Records. 
           Record 1: 
             o SCOPE:     Template ID = 258 
             o NOT-SCOPE: dataRecordsReliability = True 
           Record 2:  
             o SCOPE:     Template ID = 259 
             o NOT-SCOPE: dataRecordsReliability = True 
           Record 3:  
             o SCOPE:     Template ID = 260 
             o NOT-SCOPE: dataRecordsReliability = False 
           These Data Records indicate to the Collector that the Data 
           Records for Template ID 258 and 259 are sent reliably, while 
           the Data Records for Template ID 260 are not. 
        -  the Data Record specified by Template ID 259, transmitted 
           with full reliability  
        -  the Data Record specified by Template ID 260, transmitted 
           with partial reliability  
         
        If the Collector observes some Data Record loss from the 
        Sequence Number, the loss can only stem from the Data Sets with 
        the Template ID 260, as these are the only Sets not exported 
        reliably.  Therefore, the calculation of loss per Template ID 
        260 is possible.

        Note that, because all IPFIX Messages must be sent in order 
        within a stream, the Options Template 258, 259, and 260 will 
        always arrive before their associated Data Records, 
        respectively. 
      
        Figure 3 shows an example where stream 30 carries a Template 
        Record with Template ID 261 transmitted with full reliability 
        (FR), an associated Data Record transmitted with partial 
        reliability (PR), a Template Withdrawal Message, followed by a 
        redefinition of the Template ID 261, and finally the new 
        definition of Data Record transmitted with partial reliability.  
        The Template Withdrawal Message and the new definition of the 
        Template ID 261 are sent immediately, without waiting for the 
        Template Reuse Delay.

        The Data Record Reliability Option Template is not displayed in 
        the example in figure 3, but it should be present to indicate 
        the reliability of the Data Records specified by the newly 
        specified Template ID 261. 
                  
         
     6. IANA Considerations 

        The dataRecordsReliability Information Element must be requested 
        from IANA, following the process in [RFC5102].
