Abstract

   This document specifies the IANA guidelines for allocating new values
   in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).  This document also
   reserves some numbers for experimentation purposes.  The changes also
   affect other protocols that employ values from the ARP name spaces.


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the IANA guidelines [RFC5226] for allocating

Internet-Draft               ARP IANA Rules                November 2008


   new values for various fields in the Address Resolution Protocol
   (ARP) [RFC0826].  The change is also applicable to extensions of ARP
   that use the same message format, such as [RFC0903] and [RFC2390].

   The change also affects other protocols that employ values from the
   ARP name spaces.  For instance, the ARP hardware address type
   (ar$hrd) number space is also used in the "htype" (hardware address
   type) fields in Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) [RFC0951] and Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [RFC2131], as well as in the "hardware
   type" field in the DHCP Unique Identifiers in DHCPv6 [RFC3315].
   These protocols are therefore affected by the update in the IANA
   rules.  Other affected specifications include the specialized address
   resolution mechanisms in HYPERchannel [RFC1044], DHCP options
   [RFC2132], [RFC4361], ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) ARP [RFC2225],
   HARP (High-Performance Parallel Interface ARP) [RFC2834], [RFC2835],
   FC (Fibre Channel) ARP [RFC4338], and DNS Resource Records [RFC4701].

   The IANA guidelines are given in Section 2.  Previously, no IANA
   guidance existed for such allocations.

   This document also reserves some numbers for experimentation
   purposes.  These numbers are given in Section 3.


2.  IANA Considerations

   The following rules apply to the fields of ARP:

   ar$hrd (16 bits) Hardware address space

      Requests for individual new ar$hrd values are made through First
      Come First Served [RFC5226].  Requests for ar$hrd values below 256
      or a batch of several new values are made through Expert Review
      [RFC5226].  Note that certain protocols, such as BOOTP and DHCPv4
      employ these values within a 8 bit field.  The expert should
      determine that the need to allocate the new values exists and that
      the existing values are insufficient to represent the new hardware
      address types.  The expert should also determine the applicability
      of the request, and assign values higher than 255 for requests
      that do not apply to BOOTP/DHCPv4.  Similarly, the expert should
      assign one-octet values for requests that clearly apply to BOOTP/
      DHCPv4 but not ARP, as for example the "IPsec tunnel" with value
      31 [RFC3456].  Conversely, ARP-only uses should favor 2-octet
      values.

   ar$pro (16 bits) Protocol address space

      These numbers share the Ethertype space.  The Ethertype space is
      administered as described in [RFC5342].

   ar$op (16 bits) Opcode

      Requests for new ar$op values are made through IETF Review or IESG
      Approval [RFC5226].


3.  Allocations Defined in This Document

   When testing new protocol extension ideas, it is often necessary to
   use an actual constant in order to use the new function, even when
   testing in a closed environment.  This document reserves the
   following numbers for experimentation purposes in ARP:

   o  One new ar$hrd value is allocated for experimental purposes,
      HW_EXP (TBD).

   o  Two new values for the ar$op are allocated for experimental
      purposes, OP_EXP1 (TBD, but below 256) and OP_EXP2 (TBD, but above
      255 and preferrably with different values in the least and most
      significant octets).

   Note that [RFC5342], Section B.2 lists two Ethertypes that can be
   used for experimental purposes.

   In addition, for both ar$hrd and ar$op the values 0 and 65535 are
   marked as reserved.  This means that they are not available for
   allocation.


4.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not change the security properties of the
   affected protocols.

   However, a few words are necessary about the use of the experimental
   code points defined in Section 3.  Potentially harmful side-effects
   from the use of the experimental values needs to be carefully
   evaluated before deploying any experiment across networks that the
   owner of the experiment does not entirely control.  Guidance given in
   [RFC3692] about the use of experimental values needs to be followed.

5.  Acknowledgments

   The lack of any current rules has come up as new values were
   requested from IANA.  The author would like to thank Michelle Cotton
   in particular for bringing this issue up.  When no rules exist, IANA
   consults the IESG for approval of the new values.  The purpose of
   this specification is to establish the rules and allow IANA to
   operate based on the rules, without requiring confirmation from the
   IESG.  The author would also like to thank Brian Carpenter, Thomas
   Narten, Scott Bradner, Donald Eastlake, Andrew G. Malis, Brian
   Haberman, and Dave Thaler for feedback.

Appendix A.  Changes from the Original RFCs

   This document specifies only the IANA rules associated with various
   fields in ARP.  The specification of these rules also affects the
   allocation of corresponding fields in protocols listed in Section 1
   that share the registry.  This document does not make any changes in
   the operation of these protocols themselves.
