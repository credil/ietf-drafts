Internet-Draft                  rsync URI                      July 2009


Abstract

   This document specifies the rsync Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   scheme.


1.  Introduction

   URIs were previously defined in RFC 2396, which was updated by RFC
   3986 [RFC3986].  The procedures for registering new URI schemes are
   defined in RFC 4395 [RFC4395].  This document defines a URI scheme
   for rsync.


2.  rsync URI registration

   This section contains the registration template for the rsync URI
   scheme in accordance with RFC 4395 [RFC4395].

   URI scheme name: rsync

   Status: provisional

   URI scheme syntax: An rsync URI describes a source or destination for
   the rsync protocol including a hostname, path, and optional user and
   port.  The generic form of the rsync URI is:

   rsync://[user@]host[:PORT]/Source

   The rsync URI follows the general syntax from RFC 3986 and is defined
   by the following ABNF:

      rsyncurl        = "rsync:" hier-part
                         ; See RFC 3986 for the definition
                         ; of hier-part

   URI scheme semantics: An rsync URI may be used as either a source or
   destination for the rsync protocol.  If the port is not specified, it
   defaults to 873.

   Encoding considerations: since the rsync URI is defined using
   standard elements from RFC 3986, no special encoding considerations
   are present.

   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name: the only
   application that uses rsync URIs is rsync.

   Interoperability considerations: since only one application is

   expected to make use of rsync URIs, this URI scheme is expected to
   have few interoperability concerns.

   Security considerations: Section 7 of RFC 3986 describes general
   security considerations for URI schemes.  The considerations about
   reliability and consistency, malicious construction, rare IP address
   formats, sensitive information, and semantic attacks all apply to
   rsync URIs.  The considerations about transcoding do not apply.
   Given how rsync is regularly used, it is expected that most
   applications will not be bothered by data accessed via a given rsync
   URI changing over time.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has registered the rsync provisional URI scheme using the
   template in Section 2.


4.  Security Considerations

   Many security considerations for the usage of URIs are discussed in
   Section 7 of [RFC3986].  The considerations about reliability and
   consistency, malicious construction, rare IP address formats,
   sensitive information, and semantic attacks all apply to rsync URIs.
   The considerations about transcoding do not apply.  The rsync URI
   scheme has no particularly unique security considerations.
