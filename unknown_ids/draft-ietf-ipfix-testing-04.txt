Abstract

   This document presents a list of tests that implementers of IP Flow
   Information Export (IPFIX) compliant Exporting Processes and
   Collecting Processes should perform on their IPFIX Exporting Process
   and/or Collecting Process.  This document has been created to help
   implementers test the functionality of their IPFIX Exporting Process
   and/or Collecting Process.  The goal of these tests is to ensure that
   all important functions are covered by tests and thereby to gain a
   level of confidence in the Exporting Process and Collecting Process
   that allows the implementer to perform interoperability or plug tests
   with other IPFIX Exporting Processes and Collecting Processes.

Internet-Draft        Guidelines for IPFIX Testing         February 2008


1.  Introduction

   An IPFIX implementation, whether in software, firmware, or hardware,
   needs to be tested thoroughly in order to check its robustness and
   the conformity to the IPFIX documents it is based on.

   For a testable IPFIX software toolkit one needs at least one IPFIX
   Exporting Process and one IPFIX Collecting Process.

   This document specifies guidelines for a series of tests that can be
   run on the IPFIX Exporting Process and Collecting Process in order to
   verify the conformity and robustness of the IPFIX protocol
   implementations.

1.1.  Motivation

   The main driving force for preparing this document is the observation
   that protocols for data exchange often fail to work properly when
   implementations from different companies or organizations are in use
   together.  This happens even more often when testing binary
   protocols.  In many cases this even holds true when tests had
   previously been performed successfully using an Exporting Process and
   Collecting Process from a single implementer.  The tests listed here
   can form a valuable common basis for implementers involved in
   interoperability testing when all of them use these tests to check
   their own Exporting Process and Collecting Process implementation
   first.

1.2.  Document Scope

   This document lists tests intended to be performed between an
   implementation of an IPFIX Exporting Process and an IPFIX Collecting
   Process.  For some tests multiple instances of each of those
   components (Observation Points, Metering Process, Exporting Process,
   Collecting Process) are involved.  The tests range from basic
   transport connectivity to export of Template and associated Data
   Records, high load on the Collecting Process, and error condition
   situations.

1.3.  IPFIX Documents Overview

   The IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] provides network administrators with
   access to IP Flow information.  The architecture for the export of
   measured IP Flow information out of an IPFIX Exporting Process to a
   Collecting Process is defined in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture], per
   the requirements specified in [RFC3917].
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture] specifies how IPFIX data records and
   Templates are carried via a congestion-aware transport protocol from

   IPFIX Exporting Processes to IPFIX Collecting Process.  IPFIX has a
   formal description of IPFIX Information Elements, their name, type
   and additional semantic information, as specified in [RFC5102].
   Finally [I-D.ietf-ipfix-as] describes what type of applications can
   use the IPFIX protocol and how they can use the information provided.
   It furthermore shows how the IPFIX framework relates to other
   architectures and frameworks.

2.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document is fully aligned with the
   terminology specified in [RFC5101] which is reproduced here for
   reference.

   Observation Point

      An Observation Point is a location in the network where IP packets
      can be observed.  Examples include: a line to which a probe is
      attached, a shared medium, such as an Ethernet-based LAN, a single
      port of a router, or a set of interfaces (physical or logical) of
      a router.

      Note that every Observation Point is associated with an
      Observation Domain (defined below), and that one Observation Point
      may be a superset of several other Observation Points.  For
      example one Observation Point can be an entire line card.  That
      would be the superset of the individual Observation Points at the
      line card's interfaces.

   Observation Domain

      An Observation Domain is the largest set of Observation Points for
      which Flow information can be aggregated by a Metering Process.
      For example, a router line card may be an Observation Domain if it
      is composed of several interfaces, each of which is an Observation
      Point.  In the IPFIX Message it generates, the Observation Domain
      includes its Observation Domain ID, which is unique per Exporting
      Process.  That way, the Collecting Process can identify the
      specific Observation Domain from the Exporter that sends the IPFIX
      Messages.  Every Observation Point is associated with an
      Observation Domain.

      It is RECOMMENDED that Observation Domain IDs are also unique per
      IPFIX Device.

   IP Traffic Flow or Flow

      There are several definitions of the term 'flow' being used by the
      Internet community.  Within the context of IPFIX we use the
      following definition:

      A Flow is defined as a set of IP packets passing an Observation
      Point in the network during a certain time interval.  All packets
      belonging to a particular Flow have a set of common properties.
      Each property is defined as the result of applying a function to
      the values of:



Schmoll, et al.          Expires August 14, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Guidelines for IPFIX Testing         February 2008


      1.  one or more packet header fields (e.g. destination IP
          address), transport header fields (e.g. destination port
          number), or application header fields (e.g.  RTP header fields
          [RFC3550].)

      2.  one or more characteristics of the packet itself (e.g. number
          of MPLS labels, etc...)

      3.  one or more of fields derived from packet treatment (e.g. next
          hop IP address, the output interface, etc...)

      A packet is defined to belong to a Flow if it completely satisfies
      all the defined properties of the Flow.

      This definition covers the range from a Flow containing all
      packets observed at a network interface to a Flow consisting of
      just a single packet between two applications.  It includes
      packets selected by a sampling mechanism.

   Flow Key

      Each of the fields which

      1.  Belong to the packet header (e.g. destination IP address)

      2.  Are a property of the packet itself (e.g. packet length)

      3.  Are derived from packet treatment (e.g.  AS number)

      and which are used to define a Flow are termed Flow Keys.

   Flow Record

      A Flow Record contains information about a specific Flow that was
      observed at an Observation Point.  A Flow Record contains measured
      properties of the Flow (e.g. the total number of bytes for all the
      Flow's packets) and usually characteristic properties of the Flow
      (e.g. source IP address).

   Metering Process

      The Metering Process generates Flow Records.  Inputs to the
      process are packet headers and characteristics observed at an
      Observation Point, and packet treatment at the Observation Point
      (for example the selected output interface).

Internet-Draft        Guidelines for IPFIX Testing         February 2008


      The Metering Process consists of a set of functions that includes
      packet header capturing, timestamping, sampling, classifying, and
      maintaining Flow Records.

      The maintenance of Flow Records may include creating new records,
      updating existing ones, computing Flow statistics, deriving
      further Flow properties, detecting Flow expiration, passing Flow
      Records to the Exporting Process, and deleting Flow Records.

   Exporting Process

      The Exporting Process sends Flow Records to one or more Collecting
      Processes.  The Flow Records are generated by one or more Metering
      Processes.

   Exporter

      A device which hosts one or more Exporting Processes is termed an
      Exporter.

   IPFIX Device

      An IPFIX Device hosts at least one Exporting Process.  It may host
      further Exporting processes and arbitrary numbers of Observation
      Points and Metering Process.

   Collecting Process

      A Collecting Process receives Flow Records from one or more
      Exporting Processes.  The Collecting Process might process or
      store received Flow Records, but such actions are out of scope for
      this document.

   Collector

      A device which hosts one or more Collecting Processes is termed a
      Collector.

   Template

      Template is a ordered sequence of {type, length} pairs, used to
      completely specify the structure and semantics of a particular set
      of information that needs to be communicated from an IPFIX Device
      to a Collector.  Each Template is uniquely identifiable by means
      of a Template ID.

Internet-Draft        Guidelines for IPFIX Testing         February 2008


   IPFIX Message

      An IPFIX Message is a message originating at the Exporting Process
      that carries the IPFIX records of this Exporting Process and whose
      destination is a Collecting Process.  An IPFIX Message is
      encapsulated at the transport layer.

   Message Header

      The Message Header is the first part of an IPFIX Message, which
      provides basic information about the message such as the IPFIX
      version, length of the message, message sequence number, etc.

   Template Record

      A Template Record defines the structure and interpretation of
      fields in a Data Record.

   Data Record

      A Data Record is a record that contains values of the parameters
      corresponding to a Template Record.

   Options Template Record

      An Options Template Record is a Template Record that defines the
      structure and interpretation of fields in a Data Record, including
      defining how to scope the applicability of the Data Record.

   Set

      Set is a generic term for a collection of records that have a
      similar structure.  In an IPFIX Message, one or more Sets follow
      the Message Header.

      There are three different types of Sets: Template Set, Options
      Template Set, and Data Set.

   Template Set

      A Template Set is a collection of one or more Template Records
      that have been grouped together in an IPFIX Message.

   Options Template Set

Internet-Draft        Guidelines for IPFIX Testing         February 2008


      An Options Template Set is a collection of one or more Options
      Template Records that have been grouped together in an IPFIX
      Message.

   Data Set

      A Data Set is one or more Data Records, of the same type, that are
      grouped together in an IPFIX Message.  Each Data Record is
      previously defined by a Template Record or an Options Template
      Record.

   Information Element

      An Information Element is a protocol and encoding independent
      description of an attribute which may appear in an IPFIX Record.
      The IPFIX information model [RFC5102] defines the base set of
      Information Elements for IPFIX.  The type associated with an
      Information Element indicates constraints on what it may contain
      and also determines the valid encoding mechanisms for use in
      IPFIX.

   Transport Session

      In SCTP, the transport session is known as the SCTP association,
      which is uniquely identified by the SCTP endpoints [RFC2960]; in
      TCP, the transport session is known as the TCP connection, which
      is uniquely identified by the combination of IP addresses and TCP
      ports used; In UDP, the transport session is known as the UDP
      session, which is uniquely identified by the combination of IP
      addresses and UDP ports used.

3.  Test Specifications

   The tests described in this section MAY be performed using an IPFIX
   Exporting Process on one host and an IPFIX Collecting Process on a
   different host.  The configuration of the Observation Point, Metering
   Process, Exporting Process, and Collection Process SHOULD be recorded
   for every test along with the test results.

   The successful execution of all tests described in this section
   ensures that the tested implementation is conformant with the IPFIX
   architecture and protocol.

3.1.  Exporting Process / Collecting Process connectivity tests

   This section lists the basic tests that MUST succeed as a
   precondition for the more complex tests specified in later sections
   of this document.

3.1.1.  Connectivity tests between Exporting Process and Collecting
        Process

   The tester MUST create one Exporting Process and one Collecting
   Process, MUST configure the Exporting Process to export at least one
   Template Set and associated Data Records to the Collecting Process,
   and MUST cause the Exporting Process to initiate the export.

   When the Exporting Process and Collecting Process are to be connected
   by an SCTP transport, the tester MUST ensure that an SCTP association
   is established.

   When the Exporting Process and Collecting Process are to be connected
   by an TCP transport, the tester MUST ensure that a TCP connection is
   established.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Transport Session parameters (IP
   addresses and ports) are correct.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Data Records are actually exported.
   The transmitted data might be observed on-line with an appropriate
   packet sniffing tool, such as Wireshark (www.wireshark.org).

   The tester MUST record which combinations of IPv4 and IPv6
   transports, and UDP, SCTP, and TCP transmission protocols are
   supported, and MUST perform the test for all the supported
   combinations.

3.2.  Template and Data Record tests

   This section lists tests for checking the correct transmission of
   IPFIX Template Sets and associated Data Sets.

3.2.1.  Transmission of Template with fixed size Information Elements

   The tester MUST create a Template with a few fixed-size Information
   Elements where each data type specified in section 6.1 of [RFC5101]
   (octet, unsigned16, unsigned32 ...) is used at least once, and cause
   the Template and associated Data Records to be exported over all
   applicable combinations of transports and protocols in Section 3.1.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Template and associated Data Records
   were correctly received and decoded by the Collecting Process.

3.2.2.  Transmission of Template with variable length Information
        Elements

   The tester MUST create a Template with a mixture of fixed-sized and
   variable length Information Elements, as specified in section 7 of
   [RFC5101] and cause the Template and associated Data Records to be
   exported over all applicable combinations of transports and protocols
   in Section 3.1.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Template contains:

   o  a single variable length Information Element

   o  a single variable length Information Element followed by a fixed
      length Information Element

   o  a fixed length Information Element followed by a variable length
      Information Element

   o  multiple variable length Information Elements

   The tester MUST ensure that the Template and associated Data Records
   were correctly received and decoded by the Collecting Process.

3.2.3.  Set Padding

   Section 3.3.1 of [RFC5101] specifies IPFIX Set alignment using
   padding.

   The tester MUST create two Data Sets with padding in between
   consisting of zero valued octets, as shown in Figure 1, MUST cause
   them to be exported to the Collecting Process, and MUST ensure that

3.2.4.  Record Padding

   The tester MUST create a Template that contains the padding
   Information Element (i.e. paddingOctets), and cause the Template and
   associated Data Records to be exported over all applicable
   combinations of transports and protocols in Section 3.1.

   The tester MUST repeat the test with various padding sizes, including
   padding to boundaries other than 4 or 8 octets.

   The tester MUST ensure the Collecting Process correctly interprets
   case where the Data Records are so short that the padding is equal to
   or longer than the length of the record, so the padding might
   otherwise be interpreted as another record (e.g. 1 bytes TOS plus 3
   bytes of padding).  Refer to the specifications in section 3.3.1 of
   [RFC5101].  Figure 2 depicts such a Template, while Figure 3 depicts
   a Data Record conforming to that Template.

   The tester MUST test fixed-size padding (e.g. 12 bytes of data plus 2
   bytes of padding) and variable length padding (e.g. export a string
   and a variable number of padding bytes afterwards to align the next
   Information Element to a 4 byte boundary).

3.2.5.  Template Withdrawal Message

   IPFIX Template management and Template Withdrawal are specified in
   chapter 8 of [RFC5101].

3.2.5.1.  Withdrawal of a previously sent Template

   The tester MUST create an IPFIX Template and cause that Template to
   be exported to an IPFIX Collector over a reliable transport.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Template was correctly received and
   decoded by the Collecting Process.

   The tester MUST cause the Exporting Process to send an IPFIX Template
   Withdrawal Message to the Collector in respect of the Template.  The
   Template Withdrawal Message must be sent over the same Transport
   Session as the Template.

Internet-Draft        Guidelines for IPFIX Testing         February 2008


   The tester MUST ensure that the Template Withdrawal Message was
   correctly received and decoded by the Collecting Process, and that
   the previously sent Template was discarded by the Collecting Process.

3.2.5.2.  Withdrawal of a previously withdrawn Template

   The tester MUST create, export and withdraw an IPFIX Template as
   described in Section 3.2.5.1.

   The tester MUST cause the Exporting Process to send a second IPFIX
   Template Withdrawal Message to the Collector in respect of the same
   Template.  The Template Withdrawal Message must be sent over the same
   Transport Session as the Template.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process discards the IPFIX
   Message and shuts down the SCTP association or closes the TCP
   connection.  The tester MUST check that the Collecting Process logged
   the error.

3.2.5.3.  Withdrawal of a previously unsent Template

   The tester MUST cause the Exporting Process to send an IPFIX Template
   Withdrawal Message to the Collector in respect of a Template which
   has not yet been exported.  The Template Withdrawal Message must be
   sent over a reliable transport.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process discards the IPFIX
   Message and shuts down the SCTP association or closes the TCP
   connection.  The tester MUST check that the Collecting Process logged
   the error.

3.2.5.4.  Withdrawing all Data Templates

   The tester MUST create several IPFIX Templates and cause them to be
   exported to an IPFIX Collector over a reliable transport.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Templates were correctly received and
   decoded by the Collecting Process.

   The tester MUST cause the Exporting Process to send an IPFIX All Data
   Templates Withdrawal Message to the Collector over the same Transport
   Session as the Templates.

   The tester MUST ensure that the All Data Templates Withdrawal Message
   was correctly received and decoded by the Collecting Process, and
   that all the previously sent Templates were discarded by the
   Collecting Process.

3.2.5.5.  Withdrawing all Option Templates

   The tester MUST create several IPFIX Option Templates and cause them
   to be exported to an IPFIX Collector over a reliable transport.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Option Templates were correctly
   received and decoded by the Collecting Process.

   The tester MUST cause the Exporting Process to send an IPFIX All
   Option Templates Withdrawal Message to the Collector over the same
   Transport Session as the Templates.

   The tester MUST ensure that the All Option Templates Withdrawal
   Message was correctly received and decoded by the Collecting Process,
   and that all the previously sent Option Templates were discarded by
   the Collecting Process.

3.3.  Information Element tests

   This section lists the tests that cover the use of Information
   Elements.

3.3.1.  Enterprise-specific Information Elements

   The tester MUST cause the export of a Template and associated Data
   Record that makes use of Enterprise-specific Information Elements as
   specified in section 3.2 of [RFC5101].

   The tester MUST ensure that the Template and associated Data Record
   are correctly received and decoded by the Collecting Process, and
   that Information Elements that are unknown to the Collecting Process
   are not silently discarded.

3.3.2.  Reduced Size Encoding of Information Elements

   The tester MUST cause the export of a Template and associated Data
   Record containing Information Elements using reduced-size encoding as
   specified in section 6.2 of [RFC5101].

   The tester MUST ensure that in the case of Information Elements
   transmitted using Reduced Size Encoding, the Collecting Process is
   aware of the real size of each Information Element and not only the
   reduced size used for its transmission.

3.3.3.  Multiple instances of the same Information Element in one
        Template

   The tester MUST cause the export of a Template and associated Data



Schmoll, et al.          Expires August 14, 2008               [Page 17]

   Record containing multiple instances of the same Information Element
   consecutively.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process is able to parse
   the IPFIX Message, and stores all values received for all the
   Information Elements that appeared multiple times in the Template
   definition.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process reports the
   Information Elements in the same order as they were specified in the
   Template Record, as specified in section 8 of [RFC5101].

   The tester MUST cause the export of another Template and associated
   Data Record containing multiple instances of the same Information
   Element with other Information Elements in between.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process is able to parse
   the IPFIX Message, and stores all values received for all the
   Information Elements that appeared multiple times in the Template
   definition.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process reports the
   Information Elements in the same order as they were specified in the
   Template Record, as specified in section 8 of [RFC5101].

3.4.  Options Template tests

   This section lists the tests that cover the correct transfer of IPFIX
   Options Templates.

3.4.1.  Using any Information Elements as Scope

   Options Templates contain scope fields that give the context of the
   reported Information Elements in the corresponding Data Records.
   Scope fields are an Information Elements specified in [RFC5102].

   The tester MUST cause the export of Options Template Records
   containing various different Information Elements of each of the
   abstract data types specified in section 6.1 of [RFC5101] (octet,
   unsigned16, unsigned32 ...) in their scope fields, and MUST export a
   Data Record using each Template.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Templates and the associated Data
   Records are correctly received and decoded by the Collecting Process.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process accepts
   Information Elements in the scope field other than IPFIX Information
   Elements which have been recorded by IANA.

Internet-Draft        Guidelines for IPFIX Testing         February 2008


   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process accepts an
   Enterprise specific Information Element in the scope field.

   As specified in section 3.4.2.1 of [RFC5101], the Scope Field Count
   MUST NOT be zero.  The tester MUST cause the export of an Options
   Template Record containing a Scope Field Count of zero.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process shuts down the
   SCTP association and discards the IPFIX Message.  The tester MUST
   check that the Collecting Process logged the error.

3.4.2.  Using multiple Scopes

   The tester MUST cause the export of an Options Template Record
   containing multiple scope fields, and a Data Record conforming to
   that Template.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process reports the
   Information Elements in the same order as they were specified in the
   Options Template Record, as specified in section 3.4.2.1 of
   [RFC5101].

3.4.3.  Metering Process Statistics Option Template

   The tester MUST create a Metering Process Statistics Option Templates
   as specified in section 4.1 of [RFC5101], and MUST cause the Option
   Template and an associated Data Record to be exported.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process correctly receives
   and decodes the Option Template and associated Data Record.

   The tester MUST also check that the optional meteringProcessId Scope
   Field is supported by the Collecting Process implementation.

   If several Metering Processes are available on the Exporter
   Observation Domain, the tester MUST create a Metering Process
   Statistics Option Template containing multiple scopes and an
   associated Data Record, MUST cause the Option Template and associated
   Data Record to be exported, and MUST ensure that the Collecting
   Process correctly receives and decodes the Option Template and
   associated Data Record.

3.4.4.  Metering Process Reliability Statistics Option Template

   The tester MUST create a Metering Process Reliability Statistics
   Option Template as specified in section 4.2 of [RFC5101], and MUST
   cause the Option Template and an associated Data Record to be
   exported.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process correctly receives
   and decodes the Option Template and associated Data Record.

   The tester MUST also check that the optional meteringProcessId Scope
   Field is supported by the Collecting Process implementation.

3.4.5.  Exporting Process Reliability Statistics Option Template

   The tester MUST create an Exporting Process Reliability Statistics
   Option Template as specified in section 4.3 of [RFC5101], and MUST
   cause the Option Template and an associated Data Record to be
   exported.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process correctly receives
   and decodes the Option Template and associated Data Record.

3.4.6.  Flow Keys Option Template

   The tester MUST create a Flow Keys Option Template, as specified in
   section 4.4 of [RFC5101], where the templateId refers to an existing
   Template, and MUST cause the Option Template and an associated Data
   Record to be exported.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process correctly receives
   and decodes the Option Template and associated Data Record, and that
   the Collecting Process associates the Flow Keys with the right Data
   Record Information Elements.

   The tester MUST create another Flow Keys Data Record to be exported
   where the associated templateId has insufficient fields to satisfy
   the flowKeyIndicator.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process discards the IPFIX
   Message and shuts down the SCTP association or closes the TCP
   connection.  The tester MUST check that the Collecting Process logged
   the error.

   The tester MUST create another Flow Keys Option Template, where the
   templateId refers to a non-existing Template, and MUST cause the
   Option Template and an associated Data Record to be exported.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process shuts down the
   SCTP association and discards the IPFIX Message.  The tester MUST
   check that the Collecting Process logged the error.

3.5.  Stress/Load tests

   Stress tests are used to check correct behavior and robustness of an
   IPFIX Collecting Process implementation when a number of Data Records
   arrive very quickly.  This is especially important when IPFIX over
   UDP is used, since in that case a slow Collecting Process cannot
   block the IPFIX Exporting Processes from exporting, since UDP is not
   congestion aware.

   The tests may be dependent upon the hardware and transports
   technology in use.  Therefore the tests may need to be scaled up or
   down to meet the needs of the particular implementation.  However,
   the implementer MUST ensure that the implementation is stable under
   excessive traffic conditions, for whatever definition of "excessive"
   applies at their intended installation.

   The implementer MUST ensure the correct operation of the Exporting
   Process and/or Collecting Process when the Collecting Process is
   incapable of processing records at the rate that they are received.

3.5.1.  Large number of Records for one Template

   The tester MUST export many Data Records to the Collecting Process,
   all conforming to the same Template, in order to put the Collecting
   Process under stress.

   Depending on what that the Collecting Process does (save to file,
   store to database, analyze the data) the Collecting Process may use
   up a lot of memory.

   The tester MUST ensure that if the Collecting Process runs out of
   memory, it shuts down the specific SCTP association or closes the TCP
   connection but remains available to receive data on other open
   Transport Sessions and stays available for future Transport Sessions.

3.5.2.  Excessive rate of incoming Data Records

   The tester MUST cause Data Records to be exported to the Collecting
   Process with an increasing export rate.

   For TCP or SCTP in reliable mode, the tester MUST ensure that export
   stalls the Exporting Process once the Collecting Process becomes
   fully loaded.

   For UDP export, the tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process
   drops records as it becomes overloaded, and MUST check that the
   Collecting Process logs a warning.

Internet-Draft        Guidelines for IPFIX Testing         February 2008


3.5.3.  Large Templates

   The tester MUST create Templates with the maximum possible number of
   Information Elements, and cause these to be exported to the
   Collecting Process.

   The total length field in the IP header is 16 bits, allowing a length
   up to 65535 octets. 20 octets are required for a minimal IPv4 header,
   16 octets for the IPFIX header, 4 octets for the Set header and 4
   octets for the Template header, so the Template definition may be up
   to (65535 - 20 - 16 - 4 - 4) = 65491 octets long.  The minimum IPFIX
   Information Element specification requires 4 octets: two for the
   Information Element ID and two for the field length.  Therefore, the
   maximum number of IPFIX Information Elements in a single Template is
   65491 / 4 = 16372.  With this many Information Elements, the Template
   will be 65488 octets long while the entire packet will be 65532
   octets long.

   The tester MUST create Data Records conforming to this Template, and
   cause them to be exported.  Note that, for the implementation, the
   associated Data Records might be smaller or larger than the Template
   Records depending on the length of the Information Elements defined
   by the Template and on the presence of variable length Information
   Elements.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process correctly receives
   and decodes the Template and associated Data Records.

3.5.4.  Many new Templates within Data Template timeout interval

   The tester MUST create a large number of different Templates and
   cause them to be exported to the Collecting Process to stress test
   the Collecting Process's memory consumption.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process gracefully
   discards Templates if it's running out of memory resources, and MUST
   check that warnings are logged.

3.5.5.  Multiple Exporting Processes exporting to one Collecting Process

   The tester MUST configure multiple Exporting Processes to export
   Templates and associated Data Records to the same Collecting Process
   at the same time.

   The tester MUST ensure that all the Templates and associated Data
   Records are correctly received and decoded at the Collecting Process,
   and that no Exporting Process stalls or disconnects completely unless
   the Collecting Process runs out of memory.

Internet-Draft        Guidelines for IPFIX Testing         February 2008


3.5.6.  Export from one Exporting Process to multiple Collecting
        Processes

   If the Exporting Process supports multiple simultaneous export
   destinations, the tester MUST configure the Exporting Process to
   export Data Records in parallel to different Collecting Processes.

   The tester MUST configure the use of a mixture of simple and complex
   Templates and ensure they are all correctly received and decoded by
   all the Collecting Processes.

3.6.  Error handling

   This section lists and describes a number of problems that might
   occur in either the network or data transmission or related to wrong
   information encoding, and which the IPFIX Exporting Process and
   Collecting Process must be capable of handling in a graceful way.  It
   is intended to test the robustness and fault tolerance of the IPFIX
   Processes.

3.6.1.  Temporary network disconnect

   The IPFIX Exporting Process and Collecting Process behavior MUST be
   checked upon interruptions of data transmission due to network
   failures (whether physical or logical, e.g. defective routing).

   The tester MUST configure continuous export over all applicable
   combinations of transports and protocols in Section 3.1 in turn.

   For SCTP-based associations and TCP-based connections, the tester
   MUST create a short disconnect between the Exporting Process and the
   Collecting Process (e.g. by momentarily interrupting the network
   connection) and MUST ensure that export continues after the
   connection is repaired.  The tester MUST then create a longer
   disconnection between the Exporting Process and Collecting Process,
   and MUST ensure that export continues after the connection is
   repaired.

   For UDP-based data export there is no noticeable connection loss, but
   data received with non-consecutive sequence numbers indicates data
   loss.  Refer to the sequence number specifications in section 3.1 of
   [RFC5101].  The tester MUST create a short disconnect between the
   Exporting Process and Collecting Process, and MUST ensure that this
   is recognized and reported by the Collecting Process per section 3.1
   of [RFC5101].

3.6.2.  Exporting Process termination and restart during data
        transmission

   An IPFIX Collecting Process might be confronted with a faulty
   Exporting Process implementation that suddenly crashes, dropping any
   open connections.  The Exporting Process may be restarted again soon
   after the crash.

   Such an event will only be visible to the Collecting Process when the
   IPFIX Messages (Templates and associated Data Records) are carried
   over TCP or SCTP.  For export via UDP no such test is available due
   to the connection-less nature of the transport.

   The tester MUST configure continuous export over all applicable
   combinations of SCTP and TCP transports and protocols in Section 3.1
   in turn.  For each combination, the tester MUST establish export,
   then kill the active Exporting Process.

   The tester MUST ensure that the associated Collecting Process shuts
   down SCTP associations and closes TCP connections associated with
   that export after a suitable timeout period.

   The tester MUST Ensure that the Collecting Process discards the
   Template(s) received on the killed transport session.

   The tester MUST restart the Exporting Process again, and MUST ensure
   that the Exporting Process exports the Templates again.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process receives and
   accepts both Templates and associated Data Records from the new
   Exporting Process running at the same source host.

3.6.3.  Collecting Process termination and restart during data
        transmission

   An IPFIX Exporting Process might be confronted with a faulty
   Collecting Process implementation that suddenly crashes, dropping any
   open Transport Sessions.  The Collecting Process may be restarted
   again soon after the crash.

   The tester MUST set up an Exporting Process and Collecting Process
   and cause IPFIX Templates and associated Data Records to be exported
   over all applicable combinations of SCTP and TCP transports and
   protocols in Section 3.1 in turn.  Via UDP the restart of the
   Collecting Process will be invisible to the Exporting Process and
   have no effect.

   The tester MUST terminate the Collecting Process while the export is

   in progress, and MUST ensure that the Exporting Process shuts down
   SCTP associations and closes TCP connections associated with that
   Collecting Process.

   The tester MUST restart the Collecting Process and ensure that the
   Exporting Process connects to the Collecting Process again and that
   it exports the IPFIX Templates again.

   The tester MUST ensure that the new Collecting Process correctly
   receives and decodes the IPFIX Data Records again.

3.6.4.  Incorrect Template Records and Options Template Records

   These tests verify the Collecting Process's operation when it
   receives a Template Record or Options Template Record with an invalid
   message length.  Refer to the specifications in section 3.4.1 and
   3.4.2 of [RFC5101], respectively.

   Consider the example Template Record shown in Figure 4.  This
   Template record is missing one Information Element ID and one
   Information Element length field.  There is insufficient data in the

   o  For SCTP transport, ensure that the Collecting Process discards
      the IPFIX Message and shuts down the SCTP association, and check
      that it logs the error.

   o  For TCP transport, ensure that the Collecting Process discards the
      IPFIX Message, closes the TCP connection, and check that it logs
      the error.  Note that since TCP is a streaming (rather than
      record-based) protocol, template length errors cannot be detected
      and may cause framing to be lost, potentially rendering the
      remainder of the IPFIX stream unintelligible.  Therefore some of
      these tests are not applicable for TCP transport, as indicated.

   o  For UDP transport, ensure that the Collecting Process discards the
      IPFIX Message, and check that it logs the error.

   (a) The tester MUST create the IPFIX Template shown in Figure 4 and
   cause the Exporting Process to export it.  The tester MUST ensure
   that the Collecting Process's behaviour is as specified above for
   each transport type except for TCP, for which this test is not
   applicable.

   (b) Consider the IPFIX Template shown in Figure 4, modified with
   total length = 28.  In this case the IPFIX Message has to be rejected
   because field count = 2 and there is no second Information Element
   record present in the Set. The available data is exhausted after
   reading the first Information Element record.

   The tester MUST create the modified Template and cause the Exporting
   Process to export it.  The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting
   Process's behaviour is as specified above for each transport type.

   (c) Consider the IPFIX Template shown in Figure 4, modified with
   total length = 26.  In this case the IPFIX Message has to be rejected
   because the IPFIX Message length is too short.  After the first
   Information Element the IPFIX Message data is exhausted according to
   the total length information.

   The tester MUST create the modified Template and cause the Exporting
   Process to export it.  The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting
   Process's behaviour is as specified above for each transport type.
   The TCP connection used for this test must be manually reset after
   the test.

   (d) Consider the IPFIX Template shown in Figure 4, modified with
   field count = 1.  In this case the IPFIX Message must be rejected
   because total length is too large and does not match the amount of
   data available.

   The tester MUST create the modified Template and cause the Exporting
   Process to export it.  The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting
   Process's behaviour is as specified above for each transport type.
   This test is not applicable for TCP transport.

   (e) Finally when the IPFIX Template shown in Figure 4 is extended
   with the data shown in Figure 5, it becomes a correct IPFIX Template.

   down the SCTP association or closes the TCP connection.

   The tester MUST create an IPFIX Options Template where the field
   count is less than the scope field count, and cause the Exporting
   Process to export it.  Use the above IPFIX Options Template with
   scope field count = 2.  The tester MUST ensure that the Template is
   discarded by the Collecting Process for each transport type, and MUST
   check that the Collecting Process logs an error.  The tester MUST
   ensure that the Collecting Process shuts down the SCTP association or
   closes the TCP connection.

3.6.5.  Incorrect Data Record

   The tester MUST create the following invalid Data Records and cause
   them to be exported to the Collecting Process over all applicable
   combinations of transports and protocols in Section 3.1.

   o  IPFIX Message too short.

   o  Illegal use of reduced size encoding.

   o  Invalid length specification in case of variable length
      Information Elements.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process discards the IPFIX
   Message and shuts down the SCTP association or closes the TCP
   connection.

3.6.6.  Export of non-matching Template and Data Records

   The tester MUST create Templates and associated Data Records that
   fail to conform to those Templates in the following ways:

   o  too few Information Elements in Data Record

   o  too many Information Elements in Data Record

   The tester MUST cause the Templates and associated Data Records to be
   exported to the Collecting Process over all applicable combinations
   of transports and protocols in Section 3.1.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Collecting Process discards the IPFIX
   Message and shuts down the SCTP association or closes the TCP
   connection.

3.7.  TLS connectivity and policy selection

   This section lists tests that verify connectivity over TLS and DTLS,
   and proper selection of TLS policies as specified in the IPFIX
   Protocol.  It specifically does NOT purport to test the security of
   IPFIX Message transport over TLS or DTLS, as evaluating the security
   of a transport session is really a test of the TLS or DTLS
   implementation over which a given IPFIX implementation runs, and as
   such is out of scope for this document.

   Refer to section 11 of [RFC5101] for the security specifications.

3.7.1.  TLS test setup

   Setting up for TLS connectivity and policy testing requires the
   creation of appropriate X.509 certificates and private keys for a
   test environment, and the configuration of a DNS server to answer
   with consistent information for the hosts used in the test.

   The tester MUST configure the following certificates:

      1.  A Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and associated
      private key for signing the following certificates.

      2.  One certificate and associated private key, with a CN (Common
      Name) or subjectAltName extension of type dNSName containing the
      fully qualified domain name of the host, signed by the CA
      certificate in 1, for each IPFIX Exporting Process in the test.

      3.  One certificate and associated private key, with a CN (common
      name) or subjectAltName extension of type dNSName containing the

      fully qualified domain name of the host, signed by the CA
      certificate in 1, for each IPFIX Collecting Process in the test.

   The tester MUST configure consistent forward (A, AAAA) and reverse
   (PTR) DNS records for each host in the test on a DNS server used by
   the hosts for name resolution.

   The tester MUST ensure that the Exporting Process and Collecting
   Process are on different hosts.

3.7.2.  TLS over TCP connectivity test

   The tester MUST set up certificates and DNS as in Section 3.7.1.

   The tester MUST configure one Exporting Process and one Collecting
   Process with their appropriate certificates to transfer IPFIX
   Messages over TLS over TCP.

   The tester MUST create an IPFIX Template and associated Data Record,
   and cause them to be exported over the TCP connection.

   The tester MUST ensure that a TCP connection and a TLS connection
   were established, MUST ensure that data was exchanged, and MUST
   ensure that the data received at the Collecting Process is correct.

3.7.3.  DTLS over UDP connectivity test

   The tester MUST set up certificates and DNS as in Section 3.7.1.

   The tester MUST configure one Exporting Process and one Collecting
   Process with their appropriate certificates to transfer IPFIX
   Messages over DTLS over UDP.

   The tester MUST set up certificates and DNS as in Section 3.7.1.

   The tester MUST configure one Exporting Process and one Collecting
   Process with their appropriate certificates to transfer IPFIX
   Messages over DTLS over PR-SCTP.
