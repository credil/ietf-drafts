Internet-Draft     NAT State Synchronization Using SCSP  September 2009 
 
     

Abstract 

   To support NAT redundancy in hot standby mode [NAT-STANDBY] among a 
   group of NAT devices, the dynamic NAT entries created at the primary 
   NAT device should be synchronized consistently to the backup NAT 
   device.  This document describes a method of using the Server Cache 
   Synchronization Protocol (SCSP) for NAT state synchronization and 
   specifies the corresponding NAT specific components for this method.

Internet-Draft     NAT State Synchronization Using SCSP  September 2009 
 
    
1. Introduction 

1.1. Overall Context 

   Network Address Translation (NAT) [RFC3022] is a technique which has 
   been introduced to share the same IPv4 address between several users. 
   As a side effect, NAT can be used as a means to use global IPv4 
   addresses effectively by placing NAT devices between end-users and 
   public network. Other variants of NAT have been emerged particularly 
   in the context of IPv4-IPv6 interconnection and also to solve the 
   global IPv4 address shortage problem leading to various 
   configurations as the ones listed hereafter: 

       - NAT444 [NAT444] 

       - DS-Lite [DS-LITE] 

       - NAT64 [NAT64] 

   NAT function can be implemented on routers or standalone nodes. In 
   this memo, the term "NAT device" does not refer to a given 
   implementation scheme (whether embedded in a router or not).Besides, 
   the NAT mentioned in this document refers to stateful NAT, i.e., 
   stateless NAT is outside the scope of this document. 

   High availability is very desirable for NAT devices that operate in 
   carrier's networks. One method for achieving this is to deploy two 
   or more NAT devices with redundancy, as proposed in [NAT-STANDBY]. 
   When multiple NAT devices are deployed in a hot-standby mode(see 
   [NAT-STANDBY] for more details), the associated translation states 
   that are maintained on a primary NAT device must be synchronized to 
   its backup NAT device(s). Therefore, in case the primary NAT device 
   fails, the backup NAT device can continue performing translation 
   function for arriving IP traffic. Note that a primary and its backup 
   NAT device(s) mentioned here is specific to a given redundancy group, 
   which is a group of NAT devices deployed within a network domain to 
   perform NAT function with redundancy.  

   The NAT states mentioned in this document only mean those NAT states 
   which are created dynamically, rather than those static NAT states 
   which are configured manually on NAT devices. For those static NAT 
   states, they are essentially  part of the configuration data. The 
   replication of configuration data among a group of devices is 
   absolutely outside the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft     NAT State Synchronization Using SCSP  September 2009 
 
1.2. Proposed Procedure at a Glance 

   The Server Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP) [RFC2334] solves 
   the general server synchronization/cache-replication problem for 
   distributed databases. This document specifies a method of using 
   SCSP to achieve NAT state synchronization among the NAT devices in a 
   redundancy group. SCSP can be decomposed into two parts: (1) the 
   protocol independent part and (2) the client/server protocol 
   specific part. The protocol independent part is specified in 
   [RFC2334], whereas the client/server protocol specific part, to 
   which NAT functions corresponding to, is defined in Section 2 of 
   this document. Values for fields of the SCSP Protocol Independent 
   Part are defined in Section 3. 

   All NAT devices that belong to a redundancy group are said to belong 
   to a Server Group (SG), and the identifier of a SG (SGID) is 
   provisioned by the administrative entity which manages the NAT 
   devices. If multiple redundancy groups are created among a group of 
   NAT devices and the members of the redundancy group accords to the 
   members of the physical NAT device group, these redundancy groups 
   could share the same SGID for simplicity. For each type of NAT (e.g., 
   NAT44, NAT64, etc.), a separate SCSP Protocol ID (PID) should be 
   assigned by IANA. A pair of SGID and PID uniquely identifies a 
   specific NAT translation table that resides on a group of NAT 
   devices, respectively, and is the target to be synchronized by using 
   SCSP. All SCSP packets contain a PID and SGID ([RFC2334]).  

   Note that only a primary NAT device can create a new cache entry 
   when receiving a user packet, if the corresponding NAT mapping 
   information is not already stored. A backup NAT device MUST not 
   originate any cache entry other than receiving cache entries from 
   the primary through SCSP.  

   After the synchronization is completed, the newly elected primary 
   NAT device MUST re-originate all cache entries that were originated 
   by the previous primary NAT device. In doing so, the NAT mapping 
   information in these entries MUST be kept with the same value as 
   before, but with the "Originator ID" changed to the identifier of 
   its own. These re-originated cache entries are then flooded to the 
   other participating NAT devices following SCSP. Optimization during 
   this process is possible, e.g., an old cache entry may be with 
   higher priority in this process when IP packets with the associated 
   IP flow arrives; details for achieving such optimization is beyond 
   the scope of this document. Also in this process, it is assumed that 
   all other NAT devices in the same redundancy group would recognize 
   the newly elected primary NAT device, and with this information, a 
   backup NAT device would replace any cache entry by a new one based

Internet-Draft     NAT State Synchronization Using SCSP  September 2009 
 
   on the new "Originator ID" during the flooding procedure. Given the 
   fact that the NAT mapping information is the same between the new 
   and old cache entry that associated with a given IP flow, IP packets 
   arrived before and after the replacement of CSAS (Cache State 
   Advertisement Summary) record would be handled consistently at a NAT 
   device.  

   With regard to NAT state refreshment, as long as the primary is 
   still alive, the entries originated by it will be available except 
   that they are withdrawn explicitly by the primary due to their timer 
   expiration. Once the primary fails due to some reason, Each NAT 
   device of the same redundancy group will start an expiration timer 
   for those entries originated by the failed primary. When the timer 
   expires, all those entries will be released. An exception is for the 
   newly elected primary, that is, even though the timer for those 
   entries expires, they can not be released until they have been re-
   originated by the current primary. 

   [NAT-STANDBY] is only an example of how to achieve traffic 
   redirection and election on primary/backup among a group of NAT 
   devices, the approach defined in this document is decoupled with the 
   [NAT-STANDBY]. That is to say, the approach defined in this document 
   can be used with mechanisms other than the one described in [NAT-
   STANDBY]. The election of a primary NAT device and switchover 
   mechanism are beyond the scope of this document. 

1.3. NAT State Information Description 

   Taken IPv4 to IPv4 NAT as an example, the NAT state entry for a TCP 
   session can be represented as:  

       Private address 

       Private port 

       Public address 

       Public port 

       Remote address 

       Remote Port 

       TCP state 

       TCP timestamp

Internet-Draft     NAT State Synchronization Using SCSP  September 2009 
 
       Expiration Timer 

   whereas the NAT state entry for a UDP session can be represented as: 

       Private address  

       Private port 

       Public address 

       Public port 

       Expiration Timer 

   Note that only fully established TCP sessions are communicated, and 
   therefore there is no need for SCSP to synchronize the "TCP state". 
   Since the state refreshment can be dealt with as the OSPF does, 
   there is no need for SCSP to synchronize the "Expiration Timer".

        The IPv4 address which is dynamically allocated by the NAT46 
   for the IPv6 host. This address is also call internal IPv4 address 
   of the external IPv6 host. 

   Address Mapped to (128 bits) 

        The IPv6 address which is the original address of the IPv6 host. 
   This address is also call external IPv6 address of the external IPv6 
   host. 

3. Values for SCSP Protocol Independent Part 

   The following sections give values for fields of the SCSP Protocol 
   Independent Part of various SCSP messages. 

3.1. Values for the SCSP "Mandatory Common Part" 

   Protocol ID = TBD 

   There is a separate Protocol ID for NAT44, NAT64, and NAT46, 
   assigned by IANA. 

   Sender ID Len = 4, if IPv4 address is used, or 16, if IPv6 address 
   is used. Per [RFC2334], an identifier assigned to a server (in this 
   case, a NAT device), might be the protocol address of the sending 
   server. 

   Recvr ID Len = 4, if IPv4 address is used, or 16, if IPv6 address is 
   used. Per [RFC2334], an identifier assigned to a server (in this 
   case, a NAT device), might be the protocol address of the receiving 
   server. 

3.2. Values for the SCSP "CSAS Record" 

   Cache Key Len = 4 

   This 4-byte opaque string is generated by the NAT device that 
   originates the CSAS.  

   Orig ID Len = 4, if IPv4 address is used, or 16, if IPv6 address is 
   used. Per [RFC2334], an identifier assigned to a server (in this 
   case, a NAT device) might be the protocol address of the server. 

   See Section B.2.0.2 of [RFC2334] for a detailed description of these 
   fields.

4. Security Considerations 

   SCSP provides some base security features but only for the Protocol 
   Independent part ([RFC2334]), with no mechanism to protect the CSA 
   record. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   This document requires new values for the field of Protocol ID as 
   defined in [RFC2334], one for each NAT technology, i.e., NAT44, 
   NAT64, and NAT46.
