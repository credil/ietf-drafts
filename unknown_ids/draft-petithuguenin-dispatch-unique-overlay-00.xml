			<t>This document provides requirements for infrastructure overlays, a special kind of peer-to-peer overlay whose main purpose would be defeated if more than one instance would exist on the Internet.</t>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>
				<xref target="RELOAD"/> is a peer to peer protocol developed by the P2PSIP Working Group.
				Each RELOAD instance has a unique name, which is used by the process in section 10.2 of this specification to find the configuration servers, enrollment servers and bootstrap servers needed to join the overlay.
				The process assumes that the RELOAD instance name is a FQDN, and uses the process in <xref target="RFC2782"/> (SRV RR) to find the IP address of the HTTPS server that serves the configuration document for this overlay.
			</t>

			<t>
				This process is adequate when the management of the overlay does not need to be distinguished from the owner of the FQDN used as the instance name, which is the case most of the time.
				But there is a special class of overlays that, by definition, requires to be unique on the Internet and for which having the possibility of create instances would defeat their very purpose.
				This specification calls the kind of overlays that are not domain specific, but application specific "infrastructure overlays".
			</t>

			<section title="VIPR Infrastructure Overlay">
				<t>
					<xref target="VIPR"/> is a technology that is being standardized in the VIPR Working Group and that aims to build bridges between SIP islands by automatically provision SIP routes after the "ownership" of a PSTN phone number has been verified by an actual PSTN phone call.
					This technology uses an RELOAD overlay as a distributed database where mappings between phone numbers and servers responsible for the validation process are stored.
					The promise of VIPR to bridge these SIP islands cannot be fulfilled if there is more than one distributed database storing these mappings.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Bitcoin-like Infrastructure Overlay">
				<t>
					The existing <eref target="http://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</eref> protocol is using an IRC channel to find the initial peer servers, but one can imagine a Bitcoin-like Internet currency that is built on top of RELOAD.
					If such Internet currency is ever implemented, it would also require a unique RELOAD instance.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="BOINC-like Infrastructure Overlay">
				<t>
					<eref target="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/">BOINC</eref> is a software which is used for donating computer resources for projects as diverse as SETI@Home, Malariacontrol.net and LHC@Home.
					This kind of research benefiting humanity as a whole could probably be better served if implemented on a unique overlay.

			<t>
				<list style="hanging">
					<t hangText="REQ-1:">The mechanism used to find the configuration servers of the infrastructure overlay MUST require as little administrative overhead as possible.</t>

<t>
   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list>
<t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
   Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
   level of the document in which they are used.

<abstract>
<t>This specification defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), a peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet.  A P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage and messaging service between a set of cooperating peers that form the overlay network.  RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other applications with similar requirements by defining new usages that specify the kinds of data that must be stored for a particular application.  RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate enrollment service that provides unique identities.  NAT traversal is a fundamental service of the protocol.  RELOAD also allows access from "client" nodes that do not need to route traffic or store data for others.</t>

<abstract>
<t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has seen widespread deployment within individual domains, typically supporting voice and video communications.  Though it was designed from the outset to support inter-domain federation over the public Internet, such federation has not materialized.  The primary reasons for this are the complexities of inter-domain phone number routing and concerns over security. This document reviews this problem space, outlines requirements, and then describes a new model and technique for inter-domain federation with SIP involving the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), called Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (VIPR).  VIPR addresses the problems that have prevented inter-domain federation over the Internet.  It provides fully distributed inter-domain routing for phone numbers, authorized mappings from phone numbers to domains, a new technique for automated SIP anti-spam, and privacy of number ownership, all while preserving the trapezoidal model of SIP.</t>
