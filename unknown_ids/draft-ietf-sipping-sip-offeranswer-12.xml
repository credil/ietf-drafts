The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) utilizes the offer/answer 
model to establish and update multimedia sessions using the Session 
Description Protocol (SDP). The description of the offer/answer 
model in SIP is dispersed across multiple RFCs. This document 
summarizes all the current usages of the offer/answer model in SIP 
communication. 
			</t>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>
SIP utilizes the offer/answer model to establish and update 
sessions. The rules to govern the offer/answer behaviors in SIP are 
described in the several RFCs. (<xref target="RFC3261"/>, 
<xref target="RFC3262"/>, <xref target="RFC3264"/>, 
<xref target="RFC3311"/>, and <xref target="I-D.camarillo-sipcore-reinvite"/>.) 
			</t>
			<t>
The primary purpose of this document is to describe all forms of 
SIP usage of the offer/answer model in one document to help the 
readers to fully understand it. Also, this document tries to 
incorporate the results of the discussions on the controversial 
issues to avoid repeating the same discussions later. 
			</t>
			<t>
This document does not make normative changes. Rather, it 
recommends how to use the existing standards to best effect.
 			</t>

			<section title="Terminology" anchor="sec-term">
				<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
<xref target="RFC2119"/>.  
This document only uses these key words when referencing normative 
statements in existing RFCs.
				</t>
			</section>

		</section>

		<section title="Summary of SIP usage of the Offer/Answer Model">
			<t>
The offer/answer model itself is independent from the higher layer 
application protocols which utilize it. SIP is one of the 
applications using the offer/answer model. <xref target="RFC3264"/> defines the 
offer/answer model, but does not specify which SIP messages should 
convey an offer or an answer. This should be defined in the SIP 
core and extensions RFCs. 
			</t>
			<t>
In theory, any SIP message can include a session description in its 
body. But a session description in a SIP message is not necessarily 
an offer or an answer. Only certain session description usages that 
conform to the rules described in standards-track RFCs can be 
interpreted as an offer or an answer. The rules for how to handle 
the offer/answer model are defined in several RFCs. 
			</t>
			<t>
The offer/answer model defines a mechanism for update of sessions. 
In SIP, a dialog is used to associate an offer/answer exchange with 
the session which it is to update. In other words, only the 
offer/answer exchange in the SIP dialog can update the session 
which is managed by that dialog.
 			</t>

			<section title="Offer/Answer Exchange Pairs in SIP Messages">
				<t>
Currently, the rules on the offer/answer model are defined in
<xref target="RFC3261"/>, <xref target="RFC3262"/>,
<xref target="RFC3264"/>, <xref target="RFC3311"/> and
<xref target="I-D.camarillo-sipcore-reinvite"/>. 
In these RFCs, only the six patterns shown in Table 1 are defined for
exchanging an offer and an answer with SIP messages.
				</t>
				<t>
Note that an offer/answer exchange initiated by an INVITE request
must follow exactly one of the patterns 1, 2, 3, 4. When an initial
INVITE causes multiple dialogs due to forking, an offer/answer
exchange is carried out independently in each distinct dialog. When
an INVITE request contains no offer, only pattern 2 or pattern 4
apply. 'The first reliable non-failure message' must have an offer
if there is no offer in the INVITE request. This means that UA
which receives the INVITE request without an offer must include an
offer in the first reliable response with 100rel extension. If no
reliable provisional response has been sent, the UAS must include
an offer when sending 2xx response.
				</t>
				<t>
In pattern 3, the first reliable provisional response may or may 
not have an answer. When a reliable provisional response contains a 
session description, and is the first to do so, then that session 
description is the answer to the offer in the INVITE request. The 
answer can not be updated, and a new offer can not be sent in a 
subsequent reliable response for the same INVITE transaction. 
				</t>
				<t>
In pattern 5, a PRACK request can contain an offer only if the 
reliable response which it acknowledges contains an answer to the 
previous offer/answer exchange. 
					<list> <t/> <t>
NOTE: It is legal to have UPDATE/2xx exchanges without 
offer/answer exchanges (pattern 6). However when re-INVITEs 
are sent for non-offer/answer purposes, an offer/answer 
exchange is required. In that case the prior SDP will 
typically be repeated.  
					</t> </list>
				</t>
				<t>
There may be ONLY ONE offer/answer negotiation in progress for a 
single dialog at any point in time.
<xref target="sec.except-case-handling"/> explains how to 
ensure this. When an INVITE results in multiple dialogs each has a 
separate offer/answer negotiation. 
					<list> <t/> <t>
NOTE: This is when using a Content-Disposition of "session". 
There may be a second offer/answer negotiation in progress 
using a Content-Disposition of "early-session"
<xref target="RFC3959"/>. That is 
not addressed by this draft. 
					</t> </list>
				</t>

In Table 1, '1xx-rel' corresponds to the reliable provisional 
response which contains the 100rel option defined in <xref target="RFC3262"/>. 
				</t>
				<t>
The 'Ini' column shows the ability to exchange the offer/answer to 
initiate the session. 'Y' indicates that the pattern can be used in 
the initial offer/answer exchange, while 'N' indicates that it can 
not. Only the initial INVITE transaction can be used to exchange 
the offer/answer to establish a multimedia session. 
				</t>
				<t>
The 'Est' column shows the ability to update the established 
session. 
				</t>
				<t>
The 'Early' column indicates which patterns may be used to modify 
the established session in an early dialog. There are two ways to 
exchange a subsequent offer/answer in an early dialog. 
 				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Rejection of an Offer" anchor="sec.rej-offer">
				<t>
It is not always clear how to reject an offer when it is 
unacceptable, and some methods do not allow explicit rejection of 
an offer. For each of the patterns in Table 1, Table 2 shows how to 
reject an offer. 
				</t>
				<t>
When a UA receives an INVITE request with an unacceptable offer, it 
should respond with a 488 response, preferably with Warning header 
field indicating the reason of the rejection, unless another 
response code is more appropriate to reject it. (Pattern 1 and 
Pattern 3.) 
				</t>
				<t>
If this is a reINVITE extra care must be taken,
as detailed in <xref target="I-D.camarillo-sipcore-reinvite"/>. 
Specifically, if the offer contains any changes
or additions to media stream properties, and those have already been
used to transmit/receive media before the final response is sent, then
a 2xx response should be sent, with a syntactically correct response.
This may optionally be followed by an 
UPDATE request to rearrange the session parameters if both ends 
support the UPDATE method. Alternatively the UA may terminate the 
dialog and send an error response to the INVITE request. 
				</t>
				<t>
When a UA receives an UPDATE request with an offer which it can not 
accept, it should respond with a 488 response preferably with 
Warning header field indicating the reason of the rejection, unless 
another response code is more appropriate to reject it. (Pattern 6) 
				</t>
				<t>
When a UA receives a PRACK request with an offer which it can not 
accept, it may respond with a 200 response with a syntactically 
correct session description. This may optionally be followed by an 
UPDATE request to rearrange the session parameters if both ends 
support the UPDATE method. Alternatively the UA may terminate the 
dialog and send an error response to the INVITE request. (Pattern 5)
(While it may be tempting to respond with a 488 response in this case, 
that is not recommended, because it does not acknowledge the response.) 
				</t>
				<t>
When a UA receives a response with an offer which it can not accept, 
the UA does not have a way to reject it explicitly. Therefore, a UA 
should respond to the offer with the correct session description 
and rearrange the session parameters by initiating a new 
offer/answer exchange, or alternatively terminate the session. 
(Pattern 2 and Pattern 4) When initiating a new offer/answer, a UA 
should take care not to cause an infinite offer/answer loop.

			<section title="Session Description which is not Offer nor Answer">
				<t>
As previously stated, a session description in a SIP message is not 
necessarily an offer or an answer. For example, SIP can use a 
session description to describe capabilities apart from 
offer/answer exchange. Examples of this are 200 OK responses for 
OPTIONS and 488 responses for INVITE. 
 				</t>
			</section>

		</section>

		<section title="Detailed Discussion of the Offer/Answer Model for SIP">

			<section title="Offer/Answer for the INVITE method with 100rel extension">
				<t>
The INVITE method provides the basic procedure for offer/answer 
exchange in SIP. Without the 100rel option, the rules are simple as 
described in <xref target="RFC3261"/>. If an INVITE request includes a session 
description, pattern 1 is applied and if an INVITE request does not 
include a session description, pattern 2 is applied. 
				</t>
				<t>
With 100rel, pattern 3 and pattern 4 are added and this complicates 
the rules. An INVITE request may cause multiple responses. Note 
that even if both UAs support the 100rel extension, not all the 
provisional responses may be sent reliably. Note also that a 
reliable provisional response is allowed without a session 
description if the UAS does not wish to send the answer yet. An 
unreliable provisional response may include a session description 
in the body if the UAS has not sent a reliable response, but its 
session description is neither an offer nor an answer. All the 
session descriptions in the unreliable responses to the INVITE 
request must be identical to the answer which is included in the 
reliable response. A session description in an unreliable response 
that precedes a reliable response can be considered a "preview" of 
the answer that will be coming, and hence may be treated like an 
answer until the actual one arrives.  
				</t>
				<list> <t/> <t>
NOTE: This "preview" session description rule applies to a 
single offer/answer exchange. In parallel offer/answer 
exchanges (caused by forking) a UA may obviously receive a 
different "preview" of an answer in each dialog. UAs are 
expected to deal with this. 
				</t> </list>
				<t>
Although RFC 3261 says a UA should accept media once an INVITE with 
an offer has been sent, in many cases, an answer (or, at least a 
preview of it) is required in order for media to be accepted. Two 
examples of why this might be required are: 
				</t>
				<t/>
				<list style='symbols'>
					<t>
To avoid receiving media from undesired sources, some User 
Agents assume symmetric RTP will be used, ignore all incoming 
media packets until an address/port has been received from the 
other end, and then use that address/port to filter incoming 
media packets. 
					</t>
				</list>
				<t/>
				<list style='symbols'>
					<t>
In some networks, an intermediate node must authorize a media 
stream before it can flow and requires a confirming answer to 
the offer before doing so. 
					</t>
				</list>
				<t>
Therefore, a UAS should send an SDP answer reliably (if possible) 
before it starts sending media. And, if neither the UAC nor the UAS 
support 100rel, the UAS should send a preview of the answer before 
it starts sending media. 
 				</t>

				<section title="INVITE Request with SDP">
					<t>
When a UAC includes an SDP body in the INVITE request as an offer, 
it expects the answer to be received with one of the reliable 
responses. Other than that, no offer/answer exchanges can occur in 
the messages within the INVITE transaction. 
					</t>

					<t>
For example, in Figure 1, only the SDP in F6 is the answer. The SDP 
in the non-reliable response (F2) is the preview of the answer and 
must be the same as the answer in F6. Receiving F2, the UAC should 
act as if it receives the answer. However, offer/answer exchange is 
not completed yet and the UAC must not send a new offer until it 
receives the same SDP in the first reliable response, which is the 
real answer. After sending the SDP in F6, the UAS must prepare to 
receive a new offer from the UAC with an UPDATE request or a PRACK 
request. 
					</t>
					<t>
The UAS does not include SDP in responses F9 and F12. However, the 
UAC should prepare to receive SDP bodies in F9 and/or F12, and just 
ignore them, to handle a peer that does not conform to the 
recommended implementation.

				<section title="INVITE request without SDP">

When a UAC does not include an SDP body in the INVITE request, it

The UAC will send the answer in the request to acknowledge the

than that, no offer/answer exchanges can occur in the messages 
within the INVITE transaction.

Note that in the case that the UAC needs to prompt the user to 
accept or reject the offer, the reliable provisional response with 
SDP as an offer (pattern 4) can result in the retransmission until 
the PRACK request can be sent. The UAC should take care to avoid 
this situation when it sends the INVITE request without SDP. 
 					</t>
				</section>

			</section>

			<section title="Offer/Answer Exchange in Early Dialog" anchor="sec.oa-early-dialog">
				<t>
When both UAs support the 100rel extension, they can update the 
session in the early dialog once the first offer/answer exchange 
has been completed. 
				</t>
				<t>
From a UA sending an INVITE request: 
				</t>
				<t>
A UA can send an UPDATE request with a new offer if both ends 
support the UPDATE method. Note that if the UAS needs to prompt the 
user to accept or reject the offer, the delay can result in 
retransmission of the UPDATE request. 
				</t>
				<t>
A UA can send a PRACK request with a new offer only when 
acknowledging the reliable provisional response carrying the answer 
to an offer in the INVITE request. Compared to using the UPDATE 
method, using PRACK can reduce the number of messages exchanged 
between the UAs. However, to avoid problems or delays caused by 
PRACK offer rejection, the UA is recommended to send a PRACK 
request only when it has strong reasons to expect the receiver will 
accept it. For example, the procedure used in precondition 
extension <xref target="RFC3312"/> is a case where a PRACK request should be used for 
updating the session status in an early dialog. Note also that if a 
UAS needs to prompt the user to accept or reject the offer, the 
delay can result in retransmission of the PRACK request.  
				</t>
				<t>
From a UA receiving an INVITE request: 
				</t>
				<t>
A UA can send an UPDATE request with a new offer if both ends 
support the UPDATE method. A UAS can not send a new offer in the 
reliable provisional response, so the UPDATE method is the only 
method for a UAS to update an early session. 
 				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Offer/Answer Exchange in an Established Dialog">
				<t>
Both the re-INVITE and UPDATE methods can be used in an established 
dialog to update the session. 
				</t>
				<t>
The UPDATE method is simpler and can save at least one message 
compared with the INVITE method. But both ends must support the 
UPDATE method for it to be used. 
				</t>
				<t>
The INVITE method needs at least three messages to complete but no 
extensions are needed. Additionally, the INVITE method allows the 
peer to take time to decide whether it will accept a session update 
or not by sending provisional responses. That is, re-INVITE allows 
the UAS to interact with the user at the peer, while UPDATE needs 
to be answered automatically by the UAS. It is noted that re-INVITE 
should be answered immediately unless such a user interaction is 
needed. Otherwise, some 3pcc flows will break. 
 				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Recovering From a Failed ReINVITE">
				<t>
If a reINVITE fails, the session parameters in effect prior to the reINVITE 
MUST remain unchanged, as if no re-INVITE had been issued. 
(<xref target="RFC3261"/> section 14.1.) 
This remains the case even if multiple offer/answer 
exchanges have occurred between the sending of the reINVITE and its failure, 
and even if media has been exchanged using the proposed changes in the session.
Because this can be difficult to achieve in practice, newer specifications 
call for the UAS to send a 2xx response 
to a reINVITE in cases where rolling back changes would be problematic. 
				</t>
				<t>
Nevertheless, a UAC may receive a failure response to a reINVITE 
after proposed changes that must be rolled back have already been used. 
In such a case, the UAC should send an UPDATE offering the SDP that has been reinstated.
(See <xref target="I-D.camarillo-sipcore-reinvite"/> for details.)
				</t>
			</section>

		</section>

		<section title="Exceptional Case Handling" anchor="sec.except-case-handling">
			<t>
In <xref target="RFC3264"/>, the following restrictions are defined with regard 
to sending a new offer. 
			</t>
			<list> <t/> <t>
"At any time, either agent MAY generate a new offer that updates 
the session.  However, it MUST NOT generate a new offer if it 
has received an offer which it has not yet answered or rejected. 
It MUST NOT generate a new offer if it has generated a prior 
offer for which it has not yet received an answer or a 
rejection." 
			</t> </list>
			<t>
Assuming that the above rules are guaranteed, there seem to be two 
possible 'exceptional' cases to be considered in SIP offer/answer 
usage: the 'message crossing' case, and the 'glare' case. One of 
the reasons why the usage of SIP methods to exchange offer/answer 
needs to be carefully restricted in the RFCs is to ensure that the 
UA can detect and handle appropriately the 'exceptional' cases to 
avoid incompatible behavior. 
			</t>

			<section title="Message Crossing Case Handling">

When message packets cross in the transport network, an offer may 
be received before the answer for the previous offer/answer 
exchange, as shown in Figure 3. In such a case, UA A must detect 
that the session description SDP-2 is not the answer to offer1.

Because of the restrictions on placement of offers and answers 
(summarized in Table 1) there are a limited number of valid 
exchanges of messages that may lead to this message crossing case. 
These are enumerated in Table 3. (This table only shows messages 
containing offers or answers. There could be other messages, 
without session descriptions, which are not shown.) 
				</t>
				<t>
There are variants, shown in Figures 4a and 4b, which are dependent on an 
INVITE (Mx) that contains no offer. These are also included in Table 3.

			<section title="Glare Case Handling">
				<t>
When both ends in a dialog send a new offer at nearly the same time, 
as described in Figure 5, a UA may receive a new offer before it 
receives the answer to the offer it sent. This case is usually 
called a 'glare' case. 
				</t>

				<t>
When offer2 is in an UPDATE request or (re-)INVITE request, it must 
be rejected with a 491 response. 
				</t>
				<t>
When offer2 is in a PRACK request (within the current rules, only 
possible if offer1 is in an UPDATE request), UA A has a dilemma:
all PRACKs are supposed to be accepted with 200 response, yet there is
no way to indicate the problem with a 200 response. At best it could
proceed on the assumption that its INVITE will be rejected with a 491.
To avoid this glare condition, 
UA A should not send an offer if it has already sent a 
reliable provisional response containing an answer to a previous 
offer and has not received the corresponding PRACK request. 
				</t>
				<t>
Glare can also occur when offer2 is in a 1xx or 2xx response.
To avoid this situation, when 
UA A has sent a (re)INVITE request without session description, it 
should not send an offer until it has received an offer in a 
reliable response to the (re)INVITE, and sent an answer to that 
offer.

		<section title="Content of Offers and Answers" anchor="sec.oa-content">
 			<t>
While <xref target="RFC3264"/> and <xref target="RFC3312"/> give some guidance, questions remain 
about exactly what should be included in an offer or answer. This 
is especially a problem when the common "hold" feature has been 
activated, and when there is the potential for a multimedia call. 
 			</t>
 			<t>
Details of behavior depend on the capabilities and state of the 
User Agent. The kinds of recommendations that can be made are 
limited by the model of device capabilities and state that is 
presumed to exist.

This section focuses on a few key aspects of offers and answers

aspects to be out of scope. This section considers:

 				<t>
choice of supported media types and formats to include and 
exclude

			</list>

			<section title="General Principle for Constructing Offers and Answers" anchor="sec.oa-gen-principle">
				<t>
A UA should send an offer that indicates what it, and its user, are 
interested in using/doing at that time, without regard for what the 
other party in the call may have indicated previously. This is the 
case even when the offer is sent in response to an INVITE or re-
INVITE that contains no offer. (However in the case of re-INVITE 
the constraints of RFCs 3261 and 3264 must be observed.) 
				</t>
				<t>
A UA should send an answer that includes as close an approximation 
to what the UA and its user are interested in doing at that time, 
while remaining consistent with the offer/answer rules of 
<xref target="RFC3264"/> and other RFCs. 
				</t>
				<list> <t/> <t>
NOTE: "at that time" is important. The device may permit the 
user to configure which supported media are to be used by 
default. 
				</t> </list>
				<t>
In some cases a UA may not have direct knowledge of what it is 
interested in doing at a particular time. If it is an intermediary 
it may be able to delegate the decision. In the worst case it may 
apply a default, such as assuming it wants to use all of its 
capabilities. 
 				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Choice of Media Types and Formats to Include and Exclude">
				<section title="Sending an Initial INVITE with Offer" anchor="sec.init-inv-offer">
					<t>
When a UAC sends an initial INVITE with an offer, it has complete 
freedom to choose which media type(s) and media format(s) (payload 
types in the case of RTP) it should include in the offer.  
					</t>
					<t>
The media types may be all or a subset of the media the UAC is 
capable of supporting, with the particular subset being determined 
by the design and configuration (e.g., via <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework"/>) 
of the UAC combined with input from the user interface of the UAC. 
<!-- Used to ref 3959, but that had to be wrong. --> 
					</t>
					<t>
The media formats may be all or a subset of the media formats the 
UAC is capable of supporting for the corresponding media type, with 
the particular subset being determined by the design and 
configuration of the 
UAC combined with input from the user interface of the UAC. 
<!-- Used to ref 3959, but that had to be wrong. --> 
					</t>
					<t>
Including all supported media formats will maximize the possibility 
that the other party will have a supported format in common. But 
including many can result in an unacceptably large SDP body.  
 					</t>
				</section>

				<section title="Responding with an Offer when the Initial INVITE has no Offer">
					<t>
When a UAS has received an initial INVITE without an offer, it must 
include an offer in the first reliable response to the INVITE. It 
has largely the same options as when sending an initial INVITE with 
an offer, but there are some differences. The choice may be 
governed by both static (default) selections of media types as well 
as dynamic selections made by a user via interaction with the 
device while it is alerting. 
					</t>
					<list> <t/> <t>
NOTE: The offer may be sent in a provisional response, before 
the user of the device has been alerted and had an opportunity 
to select media options for the call. In this case the UAS 
cannot include any call-specific options from the user of the 
device. If there is a possibility that the user of the device 
will wish to change what is offered before answering the call, 
then special care should be taken. If PRACK and UPDATE are 
supported by caller and callee then an initial offer can be 
sent reliably, and changed with an UPDATE if the user desires 
a change. If PRACK and UPDATE are not supported then the 
initial offer cannot be changed until the call is fully 
established. In that case either the offer should be delayed 
until the 200 is sent, or else the offer should include the 
minimum set of media the user is able to select. 
 					</t> </list>
				</section>

				<section title="Answering an Initial INVITE with Offer">
					<t>
When a UAS receives an initial INVITE with an offer, what media 
lines the answer may contain is constrained by <xref target="RFC3264"/>. The 
answer must contain the same number of m-lines as the offer, and 
they must contain the same media types. Each media line may be 
accepted, by including a non-zero port number, or rejected by 
including a zero port number in the answer. The media lines that 
are accepted should typically be those that would have been offered 
had the INVITE not contained an offer, excluding those not offered.  
					</t>
					<t>
The media formats the answer may contain are constrained by 
<xref target="RFC3264"/>. For each accepted m-line in the answer, there must be at 
least one media format in common with the corresponding m-line of 
the offer. The UAS may also include other media formats it is able 
to support at this time. However there is little benefit to 
including added types. 
					</t>
					<t>
If the UAS does not wish to indicate support for any of the media 
types in a particular media line of the offer it must reject the 
corresponding media line, by setting the port number to zero. 
 					</t>
				</section>

				<section title="Answering when the Initial INVITE had no Offer" anchor="sec.ans-ini-inv-no-offer">
					<t>
When a UAC has sent an initial INVITE without an offer, and then 
receives a response with the first offer, it should answer in the 
same way as a UAS receiving an initial INVITE with an offer. 
 					</t>
				</section>

				<section title="Subsequent Offers and Answers">
					<t>
The guidelines above (<xref target="sec.oa-gen-principle"/> and
<xref target="sec.init-inv-offer"/> through
<xref target="sec.ans-ini-inv-no-offer"/>) 
apply, but constraints in <xref target="RFC3264"/> must also be followed. The 
following are of particular note because they have proven 
troublesome: 
					</t>
					<list style='symbols'> 
 						<t>
The number of m-lines may not be reduced in a subsequent offer. 
Previously rejected media streams must remain, or be reused to 
offer the same or a different stream. (Section 6 of <xref target="RFC3264"/>.) 
						</t>
						<t>
In the o-line, only the version number may change, and if it 
changes it must increment by one from the one previously sent as 
an offer or answer. (Section 8 of <xref target="RFC3264"/>.) If it doesn't 
change then the entire SDP body must be identical to what was 
previously sent as an offer or answer. Changing the o-line, 
except version number value, during the session is an error case. 
The behavior when receiving such a non-compliant offer/answer 
SDP body is implementation dependent. If a UA needs to negotiate 
a 'new' SDP session, it should use the INVITE/Replaces method. 
						</t>
						<t>
In the case of RTP, the mapping from a particular dynamic 
payload type number to a particular codec within that media 
stream (m-line) must not change for the duration of the session. 
(Section 8.3.2 of <xref target="RFC3264"/>.)  
						</t>
						<list style='empty'> <t/> <t>
NOTE: This may be impossible for a B2BUA to follow in some 
cases (e.g. 3pcc transfer) if it does not terminate media.  
						</t> </list>
					</list> 
					<t>
When the new offer is sent in response to an offerless (re)INVITE,
it should be constructed according to the General Principle for 
Constructing Offers and Answers (<xref target="sec.oa-gen-principle"/> ): 
all codecs the UA is currently willing and able to use should be included, 
not just the ones that were negotiated by previous offer/answer exchanges. 
The same is true for media types - so if UA A initially offered audio 
and video to UA B, and they end up with only audio, and UA B sends 
an offerless (re)INVITE to UA A, A's resulting offer should most likely 
re-attempt video, by reusing the zeroed m-line used previously. 
					</t>
					<list> <t/> <t>
NOTE: The behavior above is recommended, but it is not always 
achievable - for example in some interworking scenarios. Or, 
the offerer may simply not have enough resources to offer 
"everything" at that point. Even if the UAS is not able to 
offer any other SDP that the one currently being used, it 
should not reject the re-INVITE. Instead, it should generate 
an offer with the currently used SDP with o- line unchanged. 
 					</t> </list>
				</section>

			</section>

			<section title="Hold and Resume of media" anchor="sec.hold-resume">
				<t>
<xref target="RFC3264"/> specifies (using non-normative language) that "hold" should be 
indicated in an established session by sending a new offer 
containing "a=sendonly" for each media stream to be held. An 
answerer is then to respond with "a=recvonly" to acknowledge that 
the hold request has been understood. 
				</t>
				<t>
Note that the use of sendonly/recvonly is not limited to hold. 
These may be used for other reasons, such as devices that are only 
capable of sending or receiving. So receiving an offer with 
"a=sendonly" must not be treated as a certain indication that the 
offerer has placed the media stream on hold. 
				</t>
				<t>
This model is based on an assumption that the UA initiating the 
hold will want to play Music on Hold, which is not always the case. 
A UA may, if desired, initiate hold by offering "a=inactive" if it 
does not intend to transmit any media while in hold status. 
				</t>
				<t>
The rules of <xref target="RFC3264"/> constrain what may be in an answer when 
the offer contains "sendonly", "recvonly", or "inactive" in an a= 
line. But they do not constrain what must be in a subsequent offer. 
The General Principle for Constructing Offers and Answers
(<xref target="sec.oa-gen-principle"/>) is important here.
The initiation of "hold" is a local 
action. It should reflect the desired state of the UA. It then 
affects what the UA includes in offers and answers until the local 
state is reset.  
				</t>
				<t>
The receipt of an offer containing "a=sendonly" or "a=inactive" and 
the sending of a compatible answer should not change the desired 
state of the recipient. However, a UA that has been "placed on 
hold" may itself desire to initiate its own hold status, based on 
local input. 
				</t>
				<t>
If UA2 has previously been "placed on hold" by UA1, via receipt of 
"a=sendonly", then it may initiate its own hold by sending a new 
offer containing "a=sendonly" to UA1. Upon receipt of that, UA1 
will answer with "a=inactive" because that is the only valid answer 
that reflects its desire not to receive media.  
				</t>
					<list> <t/> <t>
NOTE: Section 8.4 of RFC3264 contains a conflicting recommendation
that the offer contain "a=inactive" in this case. We interpret that
recommendation to be non-normative. The use of "a=sendonly" in this
case will never produce a worse outcome, and can produce a better
outcome in useful cases.   
					</t> </list>
				<t>
Once in this state, to resume a two way exchange of media each side 
must reset its local hold status. If UA1 is first to go off hold it 
will then send an offer with "a=sendrecv". The UA2 will respond 
with its desired state of "a=sendonly" because that is a permitted 
response. When UA2 desires to also resume, it will send an offer 
with "a=sendrecv". In this case, because UA1 has the same desire it 
will respond with "a=sendrecv". In the same case, when UA2 receives 
the offer with "a=sendrecv", if it has decided it wants to reset 
its local hold but has not yet signaled the intent, it may send 
"a=sendrecv" in the answer. 
				</t>
				<t>
If UA2 has been "placed on hold" by UA1 via receipt of "a=inactive", 
and subsequently wants to initiate its own hold, also using 
"a=inactive", it need not send a new offer, since the only valid 
response is "a=inactive" and that is already in effect. However, 
its local desired state will now be either "inactive" or 
"a=sendonly". This affects what it will send in future offers and 
answers. 
				</t>
				<t>
If a UA has occasion to send another offer in the session, without 
any desire to change the hold status (e.g. in response to a re-
INVITE without an offer, or when sending a re-INVITE to refresh the 
session timer) it should follow the General Principle for 
Constructing Offers and Answers (<xref target="sec.oa-gen-principle"/>).
If it previously 
initiated a "hold" by sending "a=sendonly" or "a=inactive" then it 
should offer that again. If it had not previously initiated "hold" 
then it should offer "a=sendrecv", even if it had previously been 
forced to answer something else. Without this behavior it is 
possible to get "stuck on hold" in some cases, especially when a 
third-party call controller is involved. 
 				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Behavior on receiving SDP with c=0.0.0.0">
				<t>
<xref target="RFC3264"/> specifies that an agent MUST be capable of receiving 
SDP with a connection address of 0.0.0.0, in which case it means 
that neither RTP nor RTCP should be sent to the peer. 
				</t>
				<t>
If a UA generates an answer to the offer received with c=0.0.0.0, 
the direction attribute of the accepted media stream in the answer 
must be based on direction attribute of the offered stream and 
rules specified in RFC 3264 to form the a-line in the answer. 
c=0.0.0.0 has no special meaning for the direction attribute of the 
accepted stream in the answer.
