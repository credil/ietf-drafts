<abstract>
	<t>
New work is typically brought to the IETF by a group of interested
individuals. IETF meetings are a convenient place for such groups to
hold informal get-togethers to discuss and develop their ideas. Such
side meetings, which are not reflected in the IETF meeting agenda and
have no official status, are often half-jokingly referred to as "bar
BOF" sessions, to acknowledge that some of them may eventually lead to
a proposal for an official IETF BOF ("birds of a feather" session) on
a given topic.
	</t>

	<t>
During recent IETF meetings, many such "bar BOF" get-togethers have been organized and moderated in ways that made them increasingly indistinguishable from official IETF BOFs or sometimes even IETF working group meetings.
	</t>

	<t>
This document argues that this recent trend is not helpful in reaching
the ultimate goal of many of these get-togethers, i.e., to efficiently
discuss and develop ideas for new IETF work. It encourages the
organizers to consider the benefits of holding
them in much less formal settings, and to also consider alternative
means to develop their ideas. This document
<!-- April Fool's addition -->
requires
that the community abandon the term "bar BOF" and instead use other terms such "side meeting", in order
to stress the unofficial nature of these get-togethers.

	</t>
</abstract>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
	<t>
A typical IETF meeting is full of sessions of different kinds. In addition to official IETF and IRTF sessions listed in the meeting agenda, such as working and research group meetings, area meetings or plenaries, many other unofficial meetings take place. These include meetings between IETF participants from one organization or company, design team meetings, ISOC sessions, Internet-Draft editing sessions, interoperability testing, directorate lunches and many others. 	</t>

	<t>
Some of these unofficial get-togethers are organized by individual participants with a common interest in initiating new IETF work of some kind. New IETF work often fits into an existing working group and does not require an official "birds of a feather" (BOF) session to determine community consensus. Nevertheless, the phrase "bar BOF" has commonly been used in the community when talking about such informal get-togethers that are held to discuss potential new work. <xref target="RFC4677"/> characterizes a "bar BOF" as 
<list><t>
   "(...) an unofficial get-together, usually in the late
   evening, during which a lot of work gets done over drinks.  Bar BOFs
   spring up in many different places around an IETF meeting, such as
   restaurants, coffee shops, and (if we are so lucky) pools."
</t></list>
	</t>

	<t>
During recent IETF meetings, "bar BOFs" have become increasingly indistinguishable from official IETF BOFs or sometimes even IETF working group meetings. The symptoms of this trend are unofficial "bar BOFs" that are held in regular IETF meeting rooms with classroom-style seating, agendas with lengthy slide presentations, use of microphone lines, and even formal consensus calls. And, perhaps most importantly, a distinct lack of drinks.
	</t>
	
	<t>
This document argues that this trend is not helpful in reaching
the ultimate goal of many of these get-togethers, i.e., to brainstorm
about a technical topic that may eventually lead to new IETF work. It
encourages the organizers of these unofficial get-togethers to
consider the benefits of holding them in much less formal settings.
	</t>

<t>
This document also 
<!-- April Fool's addition -->
requires that the community MUST abandon the term "bar BOF". The distinction between a BOF, i.e., an official IETF activity, and a "bar BOF", i.e., an unofficial get-together, is lost on many IETF participants, especially newcomers. For that reason, the remainder of this document will use the term "side meeting" instead.
<!-- April Fool's addition -->
See <xref target="fool"/> for the related IETF process modifications.
</t>
	
	<t>
Before going into more detailed advice on how to hold side meetings, it is important to remember that many participants are extremely busy during an IETF meeting. Although having a side meeting to discuss an idea in an informal face-to-face setting is attractive, the scheduling of such meetings is therefore very difficult and needs to happen weeks if not months prior to the meeting itself. Conference calls, email discussions, wikis and other ways for interacting are also effective at developing ideas, and easier to schedule.
	</t>	
</section>

<!-- April Fool's addition -->
<section title="IETF Process Modification" anchor="fool">
<t>
<xref target="RFC2026"/> specifies the Internet Standards Process. This document updates the process described therein as follows: Whenever an IETF participant is observed to have used the term "bar BOF" in a contribution that is covered by the IETF Note Well <xref target="NOTEWELL"/>, said participant MUST purchase a beverage for all participants that were privy to the contribution. It is RECOMMENDED that the beverage be alcoholic.
</t>
<t>
Oral contributions in IETF sessions that involve the term "bar BOF" may result in a rather large fan-in of drink purchase requests. Careless participants SHOULD therefore over-provision their drink purchasing capabilities accordingly. Prioritization of drink purchases for different affected participants is not strictly defined by this document, but prioritization by alcohol content is RECOMMENDED as a general strategy.
</t>
<t>
Contributions to the IETF, whether in oral or written form, are often archived or recorded. Therefore, participants that use the term "bar BOF" in contribution can affect other participants at a much later time, e.g., when they come across the offending contribution while perusing an email or chat room archive, or in an audio recording. Participants MUST therefore be prepared to honor drink purchase requests that arrive much later than the date of the actual contribution, if proof can be produced. No timeout is defined.
</t>

<t>
Participants that are unable to understand when the Note Well applies, i.e., whether they are under obligation to follow the process outlined above, SHOULD be liberal in what they accept, and therefore follow the process just in case.
</t>
</section>

<section title="How to Invite" anchor="invite">
	<t>
A good rule of thumb is that a side meeting to discuss and develop a proposal for new IETF work should include the necessary participants to achieve that purpose, and no more. Smaller meetings are usually more successful than larger meetings.
	</t>
	<t>
Hence, it is often useful to limit attendance carefully. Publicly broadcasting an announcement for a side meeting on a particular topic, e.g., on an IETF mailing list, is therefore not usually a good method of inviting the desired set of participants.
	</t>
	<t>
One reason is that if the announcement happens to attract a large
response, the logistics of organizing a side meeting for a larger group quickly becomes very difficult. Small groups fit comfortably around a table at a bar or a restaurant, or can find a quiet corner in an IETF hallway for a discussion. Larger groups require dedicated meeting facilities, which are limited during IETF meetings, and they generally require much more careful planning in order to get work done.
	</t>
	<t>
When publicly announcing a side meeting, it is often not even possible for the organizers to determine how large the resulting get-together will be, forcing them to over-provision for the "best" case of a substantial attendance, even in cases where this turns out to be not necessary. And even when a large group comes together, it often mostly consists of "tourists" who do not actively participate in the get-together but whose attendance requires finding a larger room and makes the interactions between the active participants more cumbersome, e.g., because microphones need to be used in larger rooms.
	</t>
	<t>
In the initial stages of developing a proposal for new IETF work, the ability to brainstorm, i.e., to have  direct, interactive and high-bandwidth discussions between participants interested and experienced in the topic area, is tremendously important. This is clearly much more easily achieved in a smaller setting, where half-baked ideas can be dissected and developed. This is often not possible in a larger group. Even worse, a badly run large meeting can sometimes "poison the waters" for a proposed idea by convincing the broader community that the proposal is confused, not ready or otherwise uninteresting.
	</t>
	<t>
It is important to understand that in the IETF, proposals for new work are judged based on their technical merits and on whether there is enough energy and interest in the community to complete the work in a timely manner. This happens in the relevant working group, if one exists, or else during an official BOF session. How many warm bodies fill a room during an unofficial side meeting has no influence on this decision, and is not a good metric for reporting interest in a topic to the community or to employers. Discussions about new work are often controversial, and people will show up just to watch the fireworks, without being interested in the actual proposal itself.
	</t>

<t>
Some side meetings are organized to discuss a topic that is also
being discussed in an existing working group, either before or after the working group itself meets. Some working groups call these side
meetings "ad-hoc sessions". The fact that a side meeting is
organized by a chair or key participant of a working group in order to discuss topics related to the working group does not make it any more official than other side meetings. An "ad hoc session" is not an official working group session and no decisions relevant to a working group can be made. Working group consensus can only be established during official sessions or on the mailing list <xref target="RFC2418"/>.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Where to Meet" anchor="where">
	<t>
As the colloquial name "bar BOF" implied, such side meetings are
traditionally held in bars or restaurants. Recently, there has been a
distinct shift towards holding such get-togethers in regular IETF
meeting rooms.  One reason for this trend has been discussed in <xref
target="invite"/>; namely, that an uncontrolled broadcast announcement
requires over-provisioning of facilities.
	</t>
<t>
A second reason for this trend is that some participants, e.g., non-native
English speakers or participants with hearing difficulties, find it difficult to interact or follow a discussion in noisy environments, such as restaurants and especially bars. The organizers of side meetings are encouraged to take this factor into consideration when finding a meeting place. Quiet restaurants are not hard to find, and many offer private dining rooms at no extra charge for larger parties.
</t>
	<t>
A likely third reason why side meetings are increasingly held in IETF rooms is that the booking of such a room currently requires approval by an Area Director. The reason for this practice is simply to make sure that IETF-paid rooms are used for meetings that are in the widest sense IETF-related. However, the approval of a room request for a side meeting has been known to sometimes be reported as Area Director "support" for the topic of the meeting to the community or to employers. No such support is expressed or implied when Area Directors approve room requests! Many routinely say "yes" to every incoming request as long as there are meeting rooms available (and there are typically lots of meeting rooms available).
	</t>
	<t>
Holding side meetings in IETF meeting rooms does not make them any
more official or valid than get-togethers that happen in other
places. Participants have recently begun to list the times and locations of some
side meetings on a wiki page, but that does not make them part of
the official IETF agenda or otherwise changes their unofficial status.
	</t>
	<t>
IETF meeting rooms clearly do not provide the most supportive environment for side meetings that require brainstorming on a new technical proposal.
One reason is that the classroom-style seating often present in IETF meeting rooms tends to spread people out in rows, all facing towards a front presenter: good for presentations, bad for discussion. Because IETF meeting rooms tend to be large, and people have a natural tendency to spread out, holding a meeting in one often requires microphone use, which is cumbersome, slows a discussion down, and leads to "question-answer" dialogs between two people, which is much more ineffective than a group discussion around a restaurant table.
	</t>
	<t>
Another reason is more pragmatic. Because the organizers of unofficial
get-togethers can only use IETF meeting rooms during times when they
are not otherwise in use, such side meetings often happen during
breakfast, lunch, dinner or later in the evening. This prolongs the
time during which IETF participants are stuck in the same rooms
they're stuck in for the rest of the day, and it prevents them from
having a regular and at least somewhat relaxed meal. Anecdotal
evidence exists that at least one Area Director has not been able to
set foot outside the IETF hotel for a stretch of several days during
IETF-77. (IETF-77 was held in Anaheim, CA, and the food options in and
near the hotel were, let's say, of severely limited quality.) It is
unlikely that participants in the consequential mental and bodily
state will make productive contributions to a side meeting or, in
the case of Area Directors, will be extremely receptive towards new
work proposals.
	</t>
	<t>
Food, drink and a relaxed atmosphere in which to have a discussion are an essential part of a successful side meeting, because they often need to happen during meal times. IETF meeting rooms offer neither.
	</t>	
</section>

<section title="How to Meet" anchor="how">
	<t>
Several of the recent side meetings that were held in IETF meeting
rooms emulated official IETF meetings to a degree that made them
indistinguishable from a regular working group meeting for the average
IETF attendee. This included detailed agendas, lengthy presentations,
organizers who refer to themselves as "bar BOF chairs", emulating blue
sheets (see Section 4.5 of <xref target="RFC4677"/>), and even hums and other consensus calls (see Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC4677"/>).
	</t>
	<t>
It is not clear as to why this has been happening. One attempt at an explanation may be that holding a get-together in an IETF room and having the organizers behave like chairs behave during regular IETF sessions is causing a Pavlovian stimulus in the attendees. Another explanation attempt is that an IETF meeting room simply doesn't allow many other forms of discussion. Finally, some organizers may find the process to apply for an official BOF to complex, and so decide to simply mimic one.
	</t>
	<t>
Whatever the reason for this development is, it is reasonably obvious that running a side meeting with a focus on making quick progress on a technical proposal in a way that emulates running a working group session is not very productive. Working group sessions follow a certain procedures due to larger audiences, the need to establish formal consensus, etc. that a side meeting can do without.
	</t>
	<t>
Because the reasons for organizing such a get-together are diverse, this section is not making more specific suggestions, other than to note that meeting outside of an IETF meeting room is likely going to shift the dynamics sufficiently so that better interactions and results become possible.
	</t>	
</section>

<section title="When to Meet" anchor="when">
	<t>
Side meetings are often scheduled following IETF evening plenaries,
which frequently end before the time indicated on the meeting agenda, but can also end later. It is therefore useful to avoid scheduling side meetings that follow IETF plenaries at a fixed time. Instead, it is recommended to schedule them relative to the end of the plenary, i.e., "X minutes after the end of the plenary." That way, attendees do not need to wait around
if a plenary finishes early, and do not need to leave a plenary
should it run late.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Applicability of IPR Rules" anchor="ipr">
	<t>
The IETF's rules regarding intellectual property are set out in BCP78 <xref target="RFC5378"/> and BCP79<xref target="RFC3979"/>.  Among other things, these rules provide that any
"Contribution" to the "IETF Standards Process" (each as defined in the
rules themselves) is licensed to the IETF Trust for the IETF's use in
developing standards, and also requires disclosure of related patents
and patent applications.
</t>
<t>
A "Contribution" is "any submission to the
IETF intended by the Contributor for publication as all or part of an
Internet-Draft or RFC and any statement made within the context of an
IETF activity".
</t>
<t>
  Thus, the fact that a Contribution is made at one of
the bar BOFs or other "unofficial" or "semi-official" events described in
this document does not change or limit the applicability of the IETF's
IPR rules.  If you have a question regarding the applicability of the
IETF IPR rules in any specific context or to any specific activity,
you should consult your attorney or make an inquiry to the
IESG.
</t>
<t>
 Informally, the above makes it appropriate, in order to provide
a pointer to the relevant policies, to announce the "Note Well" text
<xref target="NOTEWELL" /> in all such meetings.


<!--
Official sessions during an IETF meeting are covered by the IETF "Note
Well" <xref target="NOTEWELL" />. Side meetings are not an official
part of the IETF meeting, so the IETF "Note Well" with its related
implications, e.g., on the need to disclose IPR, does not generally
apply. This is important for participants to realize.
-->
	</t>
	
</section>

<section title="Conclusions" anchor="conc">
	<t>
Side meeting organizers are encouraged to rekindle the original
spirit behind them and organize them outside IETF meeting rooms, at
venues with food and drink, for smaller groups and in a way that does
not needlessly mimic the way official IETF sessions are conducted.
	</t>	
	<t>	
It can often be useful to discuss proposals for new IETF work face-to-face in an informal setting, but conference calls, email discussions, wikis and other means for interactions are also effective at developing ideas, especially given the scheduling difficulties when busy individuals are involved during an IETF meeting.
	</t>	
	<t>	
Finally, it is important to remember that all side meetings during an IETF week are purely informal and have no official status whatsoever.
