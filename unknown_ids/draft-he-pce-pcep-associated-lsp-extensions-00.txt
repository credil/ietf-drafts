Extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
                    for Associated Bidirectional LSP
             draft-he-pce-pcep-associated-lsp-extensions-00

Abstract

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) requirements document[RFC5654],
   describes that MPLS-TP MUST support associated bidirectional point-
   to-point LSPs.  Path Computation Element (PCE), see [RFC4655], may be
   used for path computation of an associated bidirectional LSP.  This
   document defines the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)-based
   [RFC5440] extensions for associated bidirectional LSP.

Internet-Draft  PCEP Ext for Associated Bidirectional Lsp   October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) requirements [RFC5654] and
   control plane framework documents[RFC6373]describe that MPLS-TP MUST
   support associated bidirectional point-to-point LSPs.  Path
   Computation Element (PCE), see [RFC4655], may be used for path
   computation of a GMPLS LSP, see
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-pcep-extensions],and consequently an associated
   bidirectional LSP, across domains and in a single domain.

   Dependent path computations are requests that need to be synchronized
   in order to meet specific objectives, see [RFC6007].  For associated
   bidirectional LSP, if the forward LSP and the backward LSP are
   computed concurrently, the PCE can find the optimum path.

   This document defines the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)-
   based [RFC5440] extensions for associated bidirectional LSP.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Processing

   Consider the topology described in Figure 1.  (An example of
   associated bidirectional LSP).  The LSP1 [via nodes A,D,B] (from A to
   B) and LSP2 [via nodes B,D,C,A] (from B to A) need to be established,
   which can form an associated bidirectional LSP deployed by Single
   Sided Provisioning model or Double Sided Provisioning
   model[I-D.ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-rsvpte-ext-associated-lsp].  Node A, the
   ingress LSR of LSP1, can play the role of a PCC and request the PCE
   to compute the LSP1 or the associated bidirectional LSP.

3.1.  The Single Sided Provisioning

   For the single sided provisioning, the path computation can be
   realized by the concurrent or successive computation.  The concurrent
   computation means that the head-end submits the computation request
   for both two directional LSPs concurrently.  As to the successive
   computation, the head-end and the tail-end send the forward LSP and
   backward LSP computation requests separately.

3.1.1.  Concurrent Computation

   The PCC sends the PCReq message to PCE for computing an associated
   bidirectional LSP, whose forward and backward paths are computed
   concurrently.  Concurrent computation can ensure that the paths for
   the associated bidirectional LSP is optimal [RFC5557].

   The basic procedure are as follows:

   1.  The PCC node sends the PCReq message to the PCE with the A flag
       of the RP object set, indicates the request is for an associated
       bidirectional LSP.  Except the constraint information about the
       forward LSP, the REVERSE_LSP object may also be included in the
       PCReq message to specify the TE parameters of the backward LSP.
   2.  Once receiving the PCReq message, the PCE will compute the two
       reverse LSP based on the constraints, and choose the optimal LSP
       for the associated bidirectional LSP.  If the A bit of the RP
       object set to 1, but the REVERSE_LSP object is not present in the
       PCReq message, the PCE computes the path of the reverse LSP
       according to the forward LSP information, such as bandwidth,
       protection and so on.
   3.  After the successful computation, the PCE will supply the PCC
       with a fully computed explicit routes of an associated
       bidirectional LSP.  The explicit path for the forward LSP is
       carried by the ERO object and the backward LSP by the ERO
       subobject inserted in the REVERSE_LSP object.

   If the PCE does not support the extensions in this document,
   responses with notification.

3.1.2.  Successive Computation

   Successive computation means that the forward LSP and the backward
   LSP are computed separately.  The head-end will send request to the
   PCE for the forward LSP.  After receiving the successful computation
   result, the head-end starts to signal the forward LSP with Extended
   Association object and Reverse LSP object inserted in the Path
   message [I-D.ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-rsvpte-ext-associated-lsp].  Once
   receiving the Path message, the tail-end will be triggered to create

   the backward LSP.  The REVERSE_LSP object is extracted from the Path
   message and may be put into the PCReq message for a path computation.
   There is no need to extend the PCEP to support the successive
   computation.

3.2.  The Double Sided Provisioning

   For the double sided provisioning, the forward and the backward LSP
   configuration are send to the head-end and the tail-end separately.
   The head-end and the tail-end will send the PCReq message for the
   unidirectional LSP computation.  After the successfully computation,
   the head-end and the tail-end start to create the LSP separately.


4.  PCEP Extensions

4.1.  The Extension of the RP Object

   The PCReq and PCRep messages will need the following additional
   parameters for associated bidirectional LSP.

   An A-bit is added to the flag bits of the RP object to indicate the
   request is about an associated bidirectional LSP or not.

   o  A (RP Associated bit - 1 bit): when set, the PCC specifies that
      the path computation request relates to an associated
      bidirectional TE LSP that may be has the different traffic
      engineering requirements including fate sharing, protection and
      restoration, LSRs, TE links, and resource requirements (e.g.,
      latency and jitter) in each direction.  When cleared, the TE LSP
      is not an associated bidirectional TE LSP .

4.2.  REVERSE_LSP Object

   The REVERSE_LSP object is used in a PCReq message to specify the
   information of the reverse LSP for which a path computation is
   requested.  This object is optional.  The format of the REVERSE_LSP
   object is as follows:

   Object-Class is TBD,Object-Type is TBD.
