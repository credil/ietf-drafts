<t>This document describes practices and plans that are emerging among Internet Service Providers for the
deployment of IPv6 services. They are based on practical experience so far, as well as current plans
and requirements, reported in a survey of a number of ISPs carried out in early 2010. The document
identifies a number of technology gaps, but does not make recommendations. </t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>As is well known, the approaching exhaustion of IPv4 address space will bring about
a situation in which Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are faced with a choice between
one or more of three major alternatives:
<list style="numbers">
 <t>Squeeze the use of IPv4 addresses even harder than today, using smaller and smaller
    address blocks per enterprise customer, and possibly trading address blocks with other ISPs. </t>
 <t>Install multiple layers of network address translation
    <xref target="I-D.nishitani-cgn"/>, or share IPv4 addresses
    by other methods such as address-plus-port mapping <xref target="I-D.ymbk-aplusp"/>,
    <xref target="I-D.boucadair-port-range"/>. </t>
 <t>Deploy IPv6, and operate IPv4-IPv6 coexistence and interworking mechanisms. </t>
</list>

This document focuses on alternative (3), while recognizing that many ISPs may
be obliged by circumstances to prolong the life of IPv4 by using (1) or (2) while
preparing for (3). </t>

<t>The document describes IPv6 deployment scenarios already adopted or currently planned
by a set of ISPs who responded to a technical questionnaire. Thus, it is a factual record
of the responses from those ISPs. It makes no recommendations; the best choice of
scenarios will depend on the circumstances of individual ISPs.</t>

<t>We consider various aspects of IPv6 deployment: addressing, routing, DNS, management,
and IPv4-IPv6 coexistence and interworking. We do not consider application services
in detail, but we do cover general aspects.  </t>


<t>The reader is assumed to be familiar with IPv6. The IETF's 
view of core IPv6 requirements is to be found in <xref target="RFC4294"/>
(currently being updated as <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-node-req-bis"/>). However,
this does not give a complete view of mechanisms an ISP may need to deploy, since
it considers the requirements for an individual node, not for a network or
service infrastructure as a whole.  </t>

<t><xref target="RFC4029"/> discusses scenarios for introducing IPv6 into ISP networks, as the problem
was viewed some years ago. 
Its end goal is simply a dual-stack ISP backbone. Today's view is that
this is insufficient, as it does not allow for interworking between IPv6-only and legacy (IPv4-only)
hosts. Indeed, the end goal today might be an IPv6-only ISP backbone, with some form of
legacy IPv4 support. </t>

<t><xref target="RFC4779"/> discusses deployment in broadband access networks such as CATV, ADSL
and wireless. <xref target="RFC5181"/>, <xref target="RFC5121"/> and
<xref target="I-D.ietf-16ng-ip-over-ethernet-over-802-dot-16"/> deal specifically with 
IEEE 802.16 access networks.
MPLS-based ISPs may use the 6PE <xref target="RFC4798"/> mechanism. </t>

<t><xref target="RFC4942"/> covers IPv6 security issues, especially those that are specific 
to transition and IPv4-IPv6 coexistence scenarios. 
<xref target="RFC4864"/> discusses "Local Network Protection",
i.e., how the internal structure of an IPv6 site network can be protected. This
affects how well an ISP's customers are protected after they deploy IPv6. </t>

<t>Although the basic IPv6 standards have long been stable, it should be noted that considerable
work continues in the IETF, particularly to resolve the issue of highly scalable multihoming
support for IPv6 sites, and to resolve the problem of IP layer interworking between IPv6-only
and IPv4-only hosts. IPv6/IPv4 interworking at the application layers is
handled within the original dual-stack model of
IPv6 deployment: either one end of an application session will have dual-stack
connectivity, or a dual-stack intermediary such as an HTTP proxy or SMTP server
will interface to both IPv4-only and IPv6-only hosts or applications. </t>

<t><xref target="RFC5211"/> describes an independent view of a possible sequence of events
for IPv6 adoption in the Internet as a whole, with direct implications for ISPs. Its main point,
perhaps, is that by 2012 it will be appropriate to regard IPv4 networks as the legacy solution. </t>

<section anchor="exp" title="Survey of ISP's experience, plans and requirements">

<section title="Methodology">
<t>To obtain a view of the IPv6 experience, plans and requirements of ISPs, a questionnaire
was issued by the authors in December 2009 and announced widely to the operational community.
We promised to keep the replies strictly confidential and to publish only combined results, without identifying 
information about individual ISPs in any published results. The raw technical questions are shown in
<xref target="AppendixQ"/>, and a detailed summary of the replies is in <xref target="AppendixA"/>.
Note that although the questionnaire
was widely announced, those who chose to reply were self-selected and we can make no claim of statistical
significance or freedom from bias in the results. In particular, we assume that ISPs with a pre-existing
interest in IPv6 are more likely to have replied than others. The results should therefore be interpreted
with some care.
</t>
</section>


<section title="General questions about IP service">
<t>Thirty-one ISPs replied before the cutoff date for this analysis. 
65% of responses were from European ISPs but large operators in North America and Asia/Pacific regions are included. Commercial ISPs operating nationally predominate, with a vast range of size (from 30 customers up to 40 million). Note that some providers chose not to answer about the exact number of customers.
Nevertheless, it can be stated that 6 providers each had millions of customers, the next 10 each 
had more than 10,000 customers, and the remaining 15 each had fewer than 10,000 customers. </t>

<t>80% of the respondents offer both transit and origin-only service; 29% offer IP multicast service; 80% have multihomed customers. </t>

<t>A very wide variety of access technologies is used: xDSL, DOCSIS, leased line (X.25, TDM/PDH, SDH), ATM, frame relay, dialup, microwave, FTTP, CDMA, UMTS, LTE, WiMAX, BWA, WiFi, 
Ethernet (100M-10G), Ethernet/SDH, MetroEthernet/MPLS. Most ISPs provide CPE to some or all of their customers, but
these CPE are often unable to support IPv6. </t>

<t>Estimates of when ISPs will run out of public IPv4 address space for internal use vary 
widely, between "now" and "never".
Public IPv4 address space for customers is mainly expected to run out between 2010 and 2015,
but four or five ISPs suggested it will never happen, or at least not in the foreseeable future.
About 19% of ISPs offer RFC 1918 space to customers, and about 39% use such addresses internally. </t>
</section>

<section title="Requirements for IPv6 service">
<t>61% of ISPs report that some big customers are requesting IPv6. Predictions for when 10% of customers
will require IPv6 range from 2010 to 2017, and for 50% from 2011 to 2020. These ISPs require IPv6 to be a 
standard service by 2010 to 2015; the most common target date is 2011. </t>

</section>

<section title="Status and plans for IPv6 service">
<t>42% of ISPs already offer IPv6 as a regular
service, although in general it is used by fewer than 1% of customers. Another 48% of ISPs have IPv6 
deployment in progress or planned. These all plan at least beta-test service in 2010.
Planned dates for regular service are between 2010 and 2013 (except for one ISP who replied that it
depends on the marketing department). When asked when IPv6 will
reach 50% of total traffic, the most common answer is 2015. </t>

</section>

<section title="IPv6 technologies">
<t>Turning to technology choices, the overwhelming choice of approach (94%) is a dual stack routing backbone,
and the reason given is simplicity and cost. 39% run, or plan to run, a 6to4 relay as well, and 16% run or plan a Teredo server. However, 77% of ISPs don't have or plan any devices dedicated to IPv6. A different 77%
don't see IPv6 as an opportunity to restructure their network topology. </t>

<t>When asked which types of equipment are unable to support
IPv6, the most common answer was CPE (10 mentions).  Also
mentioned: handsets; DSLAMs; routers (including several specific
models); traffic management boxes; load balancers; VPN boxes; some SIP platforms;
management interfaces & systems; firewalls; billing systems. When asked if
such devices can be field-upgraded, the answers were gloomy: 5 yes, 4 partially, 10 no,
and numerous "don't know" or "hopefully".</t>

<t>84% support or plan DNS AAAA queries over IPv6, and all but one of these include
reverse DNS lookup for IPv6. </t>

<t>The ISPs surveyed have prefixes ranging from /19 to /48, and have a variety of policies
for customer prefixes. Fifteen ISPs
offer more than one of /48, /52, /56, /60 or /64. Two offer /56
only, eight offer /48 only.  Two wired operators offer /64 only.
Mobile operators offer /64 in accordance with 3GPP, but at least
one would like to be allowed to offer /128 or /126. Also, as many as 30%
of the operators already have IPv6 customers preferring a PI (provider independent) prefix.
The methods chosen for prefix delegation to CPEs are manual, DHCPv6[-PD], SLAAC, 
RADIUS, and PPPoE (although in fact the latter two cannot assign a prefix on their own). </t>

<t>About 50% of ISPs already operate or plan dual-stack SMTP, POP3, IMAP and HTTP services.
In terms of internal services, it seems that firewalls, intrusion detection, address management,
monitoring, and network management tools are also around the 50% mark. However, accounting
and billing software is only ready at 23% of ISPs. </t>

<t>Considering IPv4-IPv6 interworking, 58% of ISPs don't expect to have IPv6-only customers
(but mobile operators are certain they will have millions). Five ISPs report customers who
explicitly refused to consider IPv6. When asked how long customers will run IPv4-only
applications, the most frequent answer is "more than ten years". Only three ISPs state that
IPv6-IPv4 interworking at the the IP layer is not needed. On the other hand, only three
(a different three!) run or plan to run NAT-PT. At least 30% plan to run some kind of
translator (presumably NAT64/DNS64), but only two felt that a multicast translator was essential.
Among those who do not plan a translator, when asked how they
plan to connect IPv6-only customers to IPv4-only services, seven rely on dual stack
and four have no plan (one said, paraphrasing, "it's their problem"). </t>

<t>Asked about plans for Mobile IPv6 (or Nemo mobile networks), 19% said yes, and 71% said no,
with the others uncertain. A detailed analysis shows that of the six ISPs who responded positively,
three are large mobile operators (and a fourth mobile operator said "No").
The other three who responded positively were broadband ISPs ranging from small to very large.</t>
</section>

<section title="Effect of size">
<t>We examined the data to see whether any other differences emerge between the very large 
(millions of customers), medium (at least 10,000), and small (fewer than 10,000) operators. 
However, the range of answers seems to be broadly similar in all cases. The major exception is
that among the six very large operators, one plans to use 6PE and DS-lite,
and another to use 6VPE, instead of a simple dual stack. The other large
operators and all the medium and small operators prefer a simple dual stack. </t>
</section>

</section> <!-- exp -->

<section anchor="lessons" title="Lessons from experience and planning">

<t>This section is assembled and paraphrased from general comments made in the various questionnaire responses.
Any inconsistencies or contradictions are present in the original data. Comments related to missing 
features and products have been included in <xref target="gaps"/>. </t>


<t>As noted in the summary above, the ISPs that responded overwhelmingly prefer a native dual stack deployment. 
Numerous comments mentioned the simplicity of this model and the complexity and 
sub-optimal routing of tunnel-based solutions. Topology redesign is not generally considered
desirable, because congruent IPv4 and IPv6 topology simplifies maintenance and engineering.
Nevertheless, 6to4 is considered convenient for cable modem (DOCSIS) users and 6RD is 
considered an attractive model by some. 
Various operators, but by no means all, also see a need for Teredo.
One very large MPLS-based operator prefers 6PE because it avoids an IPv6 IGP and reduces operational costs.
This operator also sees IPv4 scarcity addressed by DS-lite <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite"/>
and Carrier Grade NAT, also acting as a catalyst for IPv6.
Another very large operator with an existing NAT44 infrastructure plans to use 6VPE <xref target="RFC4659"/>
and believes that NAT64 will be similar to NAT44 in support requirements.  </t>

<t>Several ISPs observe that IPv6 deployment is technically not hard. The most eloquent
statement: "Just do it, bit by bit. It is very much an 'eating the elephant' problem,
but at one mouthful at a time, it appears to be surprisingly easy."
Other comments paraphrased from the replies are:</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>Despite the known gaps, the tools and toolkits are fairly mature at this point. </t>

<t>Managerial commitment and a systematic approach to analysing requirements
and readiness are essential. </t>

<t>Evangelization remains a must, as it seems
that many ISP and IT managers are still unaware of the need for an IPv6 plan,
and are inclined to dismiss IPv4 depletion as a false alarm, and also seem
unaware that NATs create expensive support requirements. </t>

<t>Without customers wanting IPv6, getting business backing is very hard, and
IPv6 security and scale was not a focus for vendors until very recently. </t>

<t>Operators lack real experience with customer usage of IPv6, and the 
resulting lack of confidence causes delay. </t>

</list>

<t>Three further quotations are of interest:</t>
<t>"We are planning to move all our management addressing from IPv4 to IPv6 to free up IPv4 addresses."</t>
<t>"I am actively pushing our larger customers to start testing IPv6 as our development has pretty much stopped as we need some real world testing to be done." </t>
<t>"Customer support needs to be aware that IPv6 is being started in your network, or servers. We experienced many IPv6 blocking applications, applications that do not fall back to IPv4, etc. The most difficult part may be to get engineers, sales, customer support personnel to like IPv6."</t>


</section> <!-- lessons -->



<section anchor="gaps" title="Gap analysis">

<t>The survey has shown a certain number of desirable features to be missing, either in relevant
specifications, or in many products. This section summarizes those gaps. </t>

<section title="Product issues">
<t>As noted above, numerous models of various types of product still do not support IPv6:</t>
 <list style="symbols">
 <t>CPE</t>
 <t>Handsets </t>
 <t>DSLAMs </t>
 <t>Routers </t>
 <t>Traffic management boxes </t>
 <t>Load balancers </t>
 <t>VPN boxes </t>
 <t>SIP and other appliances </t>
 <t>Management interfaces and systems </t>
 <t>Firewalls.  </t>
 <t>Even where they support IPv6, customer side firewalls and routers need to operate at 25-100 Mbit/s. </t>
 <t>Intrusion detection systems </t>
 <t>Accounting and billing systems </t>
 </list>

<t>It is not the purpose of this document to name and shame vendors, but it is today
becoming urgent for all products to avoid becoming part of the IPv4 legacy. 
ISPs stated that they want consistent feature-equal support for IPv4 and IPv6 in all 
equipment and software at reasonable or no extra cost.
The problems can be quite subtle: for example, one CPE with "full" IPv6 support does
not support IPv6 traffic shaping, so the ISP cannot cap IPv6 traffic to contractual limits. </t>

<t>Numerous ISPs want a scaleable NAT64/DNS64 product. </t>

<t>The need for IPv6 support in "all the best open source tools" was also mentioned. </t>

<t>Several ISPs also noted that much commercial applications software does not correctly
support IPv6 and that this will cause customer problems. Also, some operating systems
are still shipped with IPv6 disabled by default, or with features such as
IPv4-mapped addresses disabled by default. </t>

</section>


<section title="Protocol issues">

<t>Various needs and issues related mainly to protocols were mentioned:</t>
 <list style="symbols">
 <t>A specific CPE need is an intelligent prefix sub-delegation mechanism (ease of use issue). </t>
 <t>"Getting it right" so that a dual stack client doesn't end up trying to use the wrong transport
    to reach a site. </t>
 <t>"User-side port allocation mechanisms. UPnP IGD and NAT-PMP can be used for IPv4,
    but nothing exists for IPv6 (yet)". [Editor's comment: even though port mapping
    is in principle unnecessary for IPv6, a method of opening ports through firewalls
    on demand seems necessary.] </t>
 <t>Full RA support on LAN side of ADSL CPE. </t>
 <t>PPPoE and RADIUS support. Specifically, global unicast address assignment for L2TP/PPPoE.
    Currently the PPPoE client will be assigned a link-local address, requiring a second step
    (DHCPv6 or SLAAC). </t>
 <t> Simple automatic distribution of DNS server details
     is essential; a DNS server option in RA <xref target="RFC5006"/> is wanted. </t>
 <t>ISPs need fully featured DHCPv6, especially since SLAAC does not allow 
    settings to be pushed out (except for RFC 5006). </t>
 <t>Firewall systems should not use separate IPv4 and IPv6 rules. </t>
 <t>Gaps in infrastructure security for IPv6 management. </t>
 <t>Gaps in routers' treatment of header options. </t>
 <t>RA-Guard in switches. </t>
 <t>VRRP support. </t>
 <t>PE-CE routing protocols (OSPF and IS-IS). </t>
 <t>Problems using a  single BGP session to exchange routes for both IPv4 and IPv6. </t>
 <t>Consistent IPv6 address display format in outputs and configuration input.
    Inconsistency breaks a lot of existing tools. </t>
 </list>
</section>

<section title="Documentation and general issues">
<t>We also note areas where there was clearly confusion among the ISPs responding,
which may denote weaknesses of existing documentation:</t>
 <list style="symbols">
 <t>Perhaps due to poor phrasing in the survey questions, some ISPs indicated that they
    would use PPPoE or RADIUS to assign prefixes to CPEs. In fact, IPv6 PPP only negotiates 64 bit
    interface identifiers; a full address has to be assigned by another method, and even this does
    not delegate a prefix to a CPE router. RADIUS alone is also insufficient, as it needs to be combined
    with another method for full address assignment. </t>
 <t>Although most ISPs see a need for IPv4-IPv6 interworking at the network layer, many of them
    do not see a need for an ISP to operate the resulting translator. Yet their customers,
    whether subscribers or content providers, will be the first to suffer when IPv6-only clients
    cannot reach IPv4-only services. </t>
 <t>Most ISPs seemed to misunderstand the nature of a tunnel broker, even though this is a service
    that any ISP could consider offering to its subscribers. </t>
 </list>
 
<t>Global IPv6 connectivity still has issues; for example ISPs in the Pacific region
may have to obtain IPv6 transit via the USA (a situation faced by IPv4 operators
in Europe about twenty years ago). Also, there are persistent PMTUD issues in various places on the net,
and a lack of multicast peering. </t>

<t>Finally, there was a comment that real deployment case studies must be shown to operators,
along with multihoming and traffic engineering best practices. </t>
</section>

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>As a report on a survey, this document creates no security issues in itself. ISPs did not register
any general concerns about IPv6 security. However, we note that
about half of all firewall and intrusion detection products are still reported not to support IPv6.
Some ISPs expressed concern about firewall performance and about the need for separate
firewall configurations for IPv4 and IPv6. </t>

    Two wired operators offer /64 only.
    Mobile operators offer /64 in accordance with 3GPP, but at least one would like to be allowed
    to offer /128 or /126. </t>

<t>Interworking issues:</t>
  <list style="symbols"> 
  <t>How many years do you expect customers to run any IPv4-only applications?
