      <t>This document specifies DHCPv6 options which are meant to be
      used by 4rd Customer Edge (CE) to obtain necessary parameters to
      configure their 4rd automatic tunnels. The 4rd architecture is
      defined in <xref target="I-D.despres-intarea-4rd"/>. Since
      specification of 4rd is still expected to evolve, DHCPv6 options
      may have to evolve too to fit the revised 4rd specification.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IPv4 Residual Deployment across IPv6-Service networks (4rd)
      <xref target="I-D.despres-intarea-4rd" /> is an automatic
      tunneling mechanism for providing IPv4 connectivity service to
      end users over a service provider's IPv6 network. To operate
      properly, 4rd Customer Edge (CE) requires one or more mapping
      rules configured. One mapping rule constists of the following
      parameters: Length of CE IPv6 Prefix, Domain IPv6 Prefix, Domain
      4rd Prefix, and optionally Domain IPv6 suffix. Also, Anycast BR
      IPv6 address must be configured for proper operation. This
      document defines several DHCPv6 options that allow delivery of
      required information to configure CE. Definitions of enumerated
      parameters are provided in <xref
      target="I-D.despres-intarea-4rd" />.  Since specification of 4rd
      is still expected to evolve, DHCPv6 options may have to evolve
      too to fit the revised 4rd specification.
      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="DHCPv6 Options Format">
      <t>To configure CE equipment remotely, DHCPv6 should be
      used. Several new options are defined for that purpose. Their
      format and usage is defined in the following sections.</t>
      <t>Discussion: Proposed layout assumes that several simple
      options are used. Such approach simplifies implementation as it
      is much easier for implementors to reuse existing code handling
      such options. This design choice comes at a cost,
      however. Clients must perform checks if provided set of options
      is complete. Alternatively, it would be possible to define one
      complex option that contains all mandatory
      parameters. Nevertheless, since postfix parameter is optional,
      it would still require sub-options (or conditional formatting
      that is strongly not recommended <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines"/>).</t>

      <t>Discussion: It has also been proposed that since 3 mandatory
      parameters - Domain IPv6 Prefix, Length of the CE IPv6 Prefix
      (note: these are different prefixes), and Domain 4rd prefix -
      are always present, they may be grouped together.</t>

      <section title="4rd Options Cardinality">
	<t>To properly configure 4rd infrastructure, following
	parameters are required:</t>
	<list>
	  <t>Exactly one Anycast BR IPv6 Address.</t>
	  <t>One or more 4rd mapping rules. Each 4rd mapping rule
	  consists of exactly one 4rd CE prefix, exactly one CE IPv6
	  prefix length, and exactly one 4rd prefix. Each mapping rule
	  may contain zero or one Domain IPv6 Suffix.</t>
	</list>
      </section>
      
      <section anchor="option-mapping-rule" title="4rd Mapping Rule Option">
	<t>The 4rd Mapping Rule Option does not convey any information
	on its own, but rather is used to group options that represent
	parameteres of a single mapping rule. 4rd architecture allows more than
	one mapping rules, therefore the 4rd Mapping Rule Option MAY
	appear more than once in a DHCPv6 message.</t>
	<t>The format of the 4rd Mapping Rule Option is shown in <xref
	target="figure-mapping-rule"/>.</t>

	<t>4rd Mapping Rule Option may contain additional options.</t>
      
	<t>Discussion: Defined format does not allow referencing
	rules, i.e. if there are several rules, there is no rule 1,
	rule 2 etc. DHCPv6 protocol does not allow leveraging order in
	which options appear in the message. If rule indentification
	is useful, a small ID field may be added to the 4rd Mapping
	Rule Option.</t>

      <section title="Domain IPv6 Suffix Option">
	<t>TODO: I don't understand what this suffix

	My understanding is that suffix are bits that are appended to
	Domain IPv6 Prefix + CE Index and they together form CE IPv6
	Prefix. It is only used when Domain IPv6 Prefix and CE Index
	are short enough. On the other hand, slide 4 of
	http://tools.ietf.org/agenda/80/slides/dhc-6.pdf
	suggests that suffix defines something that is appended
	after CE IPv6 Prefix.</t>
	<t>Discussion: Wouldn't it be better to just use Domain IPv6
	Prefix as a template with CE Index inserted at appropriate
	offset? This would make configuration simpler (one less
	option) and also validation of received option would be much
	more straightforward.</t>

    <section title="4rd Options Example">
      <t>TODO: Provide an example here. Possibly reuse example from Remi's
	presentation from IETF80.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Server Behavior">
      <t>Server conformant to this specification MUST allow
	configuration of one or more Mapping Rule Options.</t>
      <t>Server MUST transmist all configured instances of the Mapping
	Rule Options with all sub-options, if client requested it using
	OPTION_4RD_RULE in ORO.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC3315">RFC 3315 Section 17.2.2</xref>
	describes how a DHCPv6 client and server negotiate configuration
	values using the Option Request Option (OPTION_ORO).  As a
	convenience to the reader, we mention here that a server will
	not reply with a 4rd Mapping Rule Option if the client has not
	explicitly enumerated it on its Option Request Option.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Client Behavior">
      <t>Although other use cases are allowed, in typical use case CE
      will act as DHCPv6 client and will request 4rd configuration
      to be assigned by the DHCPv6 server located in the ISP network. A
      client that supports 4rd CE functionality and conforms to this
      specfication MUST include OPTION_4RD_RULE in its ORO.</t>
      
      <t>Client SHOULD request 4rd options in SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW,
      REBIND and INFORMATION-REQUEST messages.</t>

      <t>If the client receives OPTION_4RD_RULE option, it must verify
	the option contents, as described in
	<xref target="option-mapping-rule"/>. In case of failved
      verification, client MUST discard invalid option and continue
      processing any following options, including other instances of
      4rd options.</t>

      <t>If client receives more than one OPTION_4RD_RULE, it MUST use
	all received instances. It MUST NOT use only the first one,
	while discarding remaining ones.</t>

      <t>Note that system implementing 4rd CE functionality may have
	multiple network interfaces, and these interfaces may be
	configured differently; some may be connected to networks that
	call for 4rd, and some may be connected to networks that are
	using normal dual stack or other means.  The 4rd CE system
	should approach this specification on an interface-by-interface
	basis.  For example, if the CE system is attached to multiple
	networks that provide the 4rd Mapping Rule Option, then the CE
	system MUST configure a 4rd tunnel for each interface
	separately as each 4rd provides IPv4 connectivity for each
	distinct interface. Means to bind a 4rd configuration to a
	given interface in a multiple interfaces device are out of
	scope of this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Implementation of this document does not present any new security issues, but as with
	all DHCPv6-derived configuration state, it is completely possible that
	the configuration is being delivered by a third party (Man In The
	Middle).  As such, there is no basis to trust that the access the
	4rd can be trusted, and it should not therefore bypass any
	security mechanisms such as IP firewalls.</t>

      <t>Section 23 of <xref target="RFC3315"/> discusses DHCPv6-related security issues.</t>

      <t>Section 6 of <xref target="I-D.despres-intarea-4rd"/> discusses 4rd
      related security issues.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is requested to allocate DHCPv6 option codes referencing
	this document, delineating OPTION_4RD_RULE, OPTION_4RD_PREFIX6,
	OPTION_4RD_PREFIX6_LEN, OPTION_4RD_PREFIX and OPTION_4RD_BR
