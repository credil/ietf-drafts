Abstract

   This draft specifies OAM messages to indicate service disruptive
   conditions for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs).  The notification mechanism employs a generic method for a
   service disruptive condition to be communicated to a Maintenance End
   Point (MEP).  An MPLS Operation, Administration, and Maintenance
   (OAM) channel is defined along with messages to communicate various
   types of service disruptive conditions.

Internet-Draft          MPLS Fault Management OAM              July 2010


1.  Introduction

   In traditional transport networks, circuits such as T1 lines are
   provisioned on multiple switches.  When a disruption occurs on any
   link or node along the path of such a transport circuit, OAM are
   generated which may in turn suppress alarms and/or activate a backup
   circuit.  The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) provides mechanisms to
   emulate traditional transport circuits.  Therefore a Fault Management
   (FM) capability must be defined for MPLS.  This capability is being
   defined to meet the MPLS-TP requirements as defined in RFC 5654 [1],
   and the MPLS-TP Operations, Administration and Maintenance
   Requirements as defined in RFC 5860 [2].  However, this mechanism is
   intended to be applicable to other aspects of MPLS as well.

   Two broad classes service disruptive conditions are identified.

   1.  Defect: the situation in which the density of anomalies has
       reached a level where the ability to perform a required function
       has been interrupted.

   2.  Lock: an administrative status in which it is expected that only
       test traffic, if any, and OAM (dedicated to the LSP) can be sent
       on an LSP.

   Within the Defect class, a further category, Fault is identified.  A
   fault is the inability of a function to perform a required action.  A
   fault is a persistent defect.

   This document specifies an MPLS OAM channel called an "MPLS-OAM Fault
   Management (FM)" channel.  A single message format and a set of
   procedures are defined to communicate service disruptive conditions
   from the location where they occur to the endpoints of LSPs which are
   affected by those conditions.  Multiple message types and flags are
   used to indicate and qualify the particular condition.

   Corresponding to the three classes of service disruptive conditions
   listed above, two messages are defined to communicate the type of
   condition.  These are known as:

      Alarm Indication Signal (AIS)

      Lock Report (LKR)

2.  MPLS Fault Management Messages

   This document defines messages to indicate service disruptive
   conditions.  Two messages are defined Alarm Indication Signal, and
   Lock Report.  These semantics of the individual messages are
   described in subsections below.

   Fault Management messages are carried in-band by using the Associated
   Channel Header (ACH) and Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) as
   defined in RFC5586 [4].  To facilitate recognition and delivery of
   Fault Management messages, the Fault Management Channel is identified

   by a unique ACH codepoint.

   Fault OAM messages are generated by intermediate nodes where an LSP
   is switched.  When a server layer, (e.g. a link) used by the LSP
   fails, the intermediate node sends Fault Management messages using
   the LSP's Fault associated channel back to the endpoint of the LSP.
   Strictly speaking, when a server MEP detects a service disruptive
   condition, Fault Management messages are generated by the convergence
   server-to-client adaptation function.  The messages are sent to the
   client MEPs by inserting them into the affected LSPs in the direction
   opposite to the detecting MEP's peer server MEP(s).  The message is
   sent periodically until the condition is cleared.

2.1.  MPLS-TP Alarm Indication Signal

   The MPLS-TP Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) message is generated in
   response to detecting defects in the server layer.  The AIS message
   SHOULD be sent as soon as the condition is detected, that is before
   any determination has been made as to whether the condition is
   persistent and therefore fatal.  For example, an AIS message may be
   sent during a protection switching event and would cease being sent
   (or cease being forwarded by the protection switch selector) if the
   protection switch was successful in restoring the link.

   Its primary purpose is to suppress alarms in the MPLS-TP layer
   network above the level at which the defect occurs.  The AIS message
   MAY be used to trigger recovery mechanisms.  It should be noted that
   such use would be subject to false positives, e.g. unnecessary
   protection switching events in the client layer.

2.1.1.  MPLS-TP Link Down Indication

   The LDI flag is set in response to detecting a fatal failure in the
   server layer.  The LDI flag MUST NOT be set until the defect has been
   determined to be fatal.  For example during a protection switching
   event the LDI flag is not set.  However if the protection switch was
   unsuccessful in restoring the link within the expected repair time,
   the LDI flag MUST be set.

   The receipt of an AIS message with the LDI flag set MAY be treated as
   the equivalent of loss of continuity at the client layer.  The choice
   of treatment is related to the rate at which the Continuity Check
   (CC) function is running.  In a normal transport environment, CC is
   run at a high rate in order to detect a failure within 10s of
   milliseconds.  In such an environment, AIS messages with the LDI flag
   set should be treated the same as any other AIS message, that is,
   used solely for alarm suppression.

Internet-Draft          MPLS Fault Management OAM              July 2010


   In more general MPLS environments the CC function may be running at a
   much slower rate.  In this environment, the LDI flag enables faster
   switch-over upon a failure occurring along the LSP.

2.2.  MPLS-TP Lock Report

   The MPLS-TP Lock Report (LKR) message is generated when a server
   layer entity has been administratively locked to communicated that
   condition to inform the client layer entities of that condition.
   When an MPLS-TP LSP is administratively locked it is not available to
   carry client traffic.  Its purpose is to suppress alarms in the
   MPLS-TP layer network above the level at which the defect occurs and
   to allow the clients to differentiate the lock condition from a
   defect condition.

   The receipt of an LKR message MAY be treated as the equivalent of
   loss of continuity at the client layer.  Like AIS it also is used to
   suppress alarms.


3.  MPLS Fault Management Channel

   The MPLS Fault Management channel is identified by the ACH as defined
   in RFC 5586 [4] with the Channel Type set to the MPLS Fault
   Management (FM) code point = 0xHH.  [HH to be assigned by IANA from
   the PW Associated Channel Type registry.]  The FM Channel does not
   use ACH TLVs and MUST not include the ACH TLV header.  The FM ACH
   Channel is shown below.

   TLVs are used in fault OAM to carry information that may not pertain
   to all messages as well as to allow for extensibility.  The TLVs
   currently defined are the IF_ID, Global-ID, and ICC.

   TLVs (Type-Length-Value tuples) have the following format:

5.  Sending and Receiving Fault Management Messages

5.1.  Sending a Fault Management Message

   Service disruptive conditions are indicated by sending FM messages.
   The message type is set to the value corresponding to the condition.
   The refresh timer is set to the maximum time between successive FM
   messages.  This value MUST not be changed on successive FM messages.
   If the optional clearing procedures are not used, then the default
   value is 1.  Otherwise the default value is 20.

   A Global-ID TLV or an ICC TLV MAY be included.  The IF_ID TLV SHOULD
   be included.  If the R-Flag clearing procedures are to be used, the
   IF_ID TLV MUST be included.

   The message is then sent.  The message MUST be refreshed twice at an
   interval of one second.  Further refreshes are sent according to the
   value of the refresh timer.  Refreshing continues until the condition
   is cleared.

5.2.  Clearing a FM Indication

   Ceasing to send FM messages will clear the indication after 3.5 times
   the Refresh Timer.  To clear an indication more quickly, the
   following procedure is used.  The R-Flag of the FM message is set to
   one.  Other fields of the FM message SHOULD NOT be modified.  The
   message is sent immediately and then refreshed twice at an interval
   of one second.

5.3.  Receiving a FM Indication

   When a FM message is received, a MEP examines it to ensure that that
   it is well formed.  If the message type is unknown, the message is
   ignored.  If the R-Flag is zero, the condition corresponding to the
   message type is entered.  A timer is set to 3.5 times the refresh

   timer.  If the message is not refreshed within this period, the
   condition is cleared.  A message is considered a refresh if the
   message type and IF_ID match an existing condition and the R-Flag is
   set to zero.

   If the R-Flag is set to one, the MEP checks to see if a condition
   matching the message type and IF_ID exists.  If it does, that
   condition is cleared.  Otherwise the message is ignored.


6.  Security Considerations

   Spurious fault OAM messages form a vector for a denial of service
   attack.  However, since these messages are carried in a control
   channel, one would have to gain access to a node providing the
   service in order to effect such an attack.  Since transport networks
   are usually operated as a walled garden, such threats are less
   likely.


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Pseudowire Associated Channel Type

   Fault OAM requires a unique Associated Channel Type which are
   assigned by IANA from the Pseudowire Associated Channel Types
   Registry.

   Registry:
   Value        Description              TLV Follows  Reference
   -----------  -----------------------  -----------  ---------
   0xHHHH       Fault OAM                No           (This Document)

7.2.  MPLS Fault OAM Message Type Registry

   This sections details the MPLS Fault OAM TLV Registry, a new name
   spaces to be managed by IANA.  The Type space is divided into
   assignment ranges; the following terms are used in describing the
   procedures by which IANA allocates values: "Standards Action" (as
   defined in RFC 5226 [6]) and "Private Use".

   MPLS Fault OAM Message Types take values in the range 0-255.
   Assignments in the range 0-251 are via Standards Action; values in
   the range 251-255 are for Private Use, and MUST NOT be allocated.

   Message Types defined in this document are:

7.3.  MPLS Fault OAM TLV Registry

   This sections details the MPLS Fault OAM TLV Registry, a new name
   spaces to be managed by IANA.  The Type space is divided into
   assignment ranges; the following terms are used in describing the
   procedures by which IANA allocates values: "Standards Action" (as
   defined in RFC 5226 [6]), "Specification Required" and "Private Use".

   MPLS Fault OAM TLVs which take values in the range 0-255.
   Assignments in the range 0-191 are via Standards Action; assignments
   in the range 192-248 are made via "Specification Required"; values in
   the range 248-255 are for Private Use, and MUST NOT be allocated.

   TLVs defined in this document are:

      Value    TLV Name
      -----    -------
          0    Reserved
          1    Interface Identifier TLV
          2    Global Identifier
