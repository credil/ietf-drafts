    <abstract>
      <t>Generic mechanism for mapping between an IPv4 prefix, address
      or parts of thereof, and transport layer between ports and an
      IPv6 prefix or address is specified in <xref
      target="map-design"/>. This is a companion document that
      specifies provisioning mechanism of MAP rules. It defines DHCPv6
      options which are meant to be used between Customer Edge (CE)
      devices and DHCPv6 server to obtain necessary parameters to
      configure MAP rules. Since specification of MAP
      architecture is still expected to evolve, DHCPv6 options may
      have to evolve too to fit the revised MAP specification.</t>

    <!--  SECTION 1:  Introduction                  -->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) defined in <xref
      target="map-design" /> is a mechanism for providing
      IPv4 connectivity service to end users over a service provider's
      IPv6 network. It defines MAP Border Relay (BR) router that is
      located that the edge of a MAP domain. MAP Customer Edge (CE) is
      also defined as a device typically deployed at customers'
      location.  In a residential broadband deployment, this type of
      device is sometimes referred to as a Residential Gateway (RG) or
      Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). A MAP CE may also be referred
      to simply as a "CE" within the context of MAP.</t>

      <t>A typical MAP CE adopting MAP rules will serve a residential
      site with one WAN side interface, one or more LAN side
      interfaces. To operate properly, it requires one or more MAP
      rules and additional informations. In larger networks it is
      infeasible to configure such parameters manually. Therefore
      provisioning mechanism is required. Such mechanism is defined in
      this document. It leverages existing DHCPv6 <xref
      target="RFC3315"/> protocol to deliver necessary parameters to
      CE.</t>

      <t>This document defines several DHCPv6 options that allow
      delivery of required information to configure CE. Configuration
      of the BR is outside of scope of this document. Definitions of
      used parameters are provided in <xref target="map-design" />.</t>

      <t>Since specification of MAP architecture is still expected to
      evolve, DHCPv6 options may have to evolve too to fit the revised
      MAP specification.

    <section anchor="description" title="Provisioning mechanism">

      <t>A typical MAP CE usually acts as a DHCPv6 client and requests
      options that are being provided by a DHCPv6 server located
      somewhere in ISP network. It would adopt three kinds of
      parameters independently:</t>

      <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>MAP mapping rules are defined in <xref
        target="map-design"/>, including Rule IPv6 prefix/length,
        Rule IPv4 prefix and BR IPv6 prefix. One MAP CE can receive
        one or more MAP mapping rules from the DHCPv6 server, the
        first of which should be the default MAP mapping rule for the
        initiated CE of its own, followed by other mapping rules
        within the MAP domain if necessary.</t>
        <t>Transport mode indicates encapsulation or translation mode for MAP
        approach. It should be conducted on interface-by-interface
        basis</t>
        <t>Discussion: Qiong also proposed to add deployment mode
        here.  Jacni Qin recommends against it. Deployment mode is to
        notify whether CE is in Hub and spoke mode or mesh. In Hub and
        spoke mode, only the first default MAP mapping rule is needed
        in the following MAP procedure. While in mesh mode, all MAP
        mapping rules are included to achieve CE-CE traffic
        optimization.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Options Format">
      <t>DHCPv6 protocol is used for CE provisioning. Several new
      options are defined for conveying MAP-specific parameters. Their
      format and usage is defined in the following sections.</t>

      <t>Discussion: As the exact parameters required to configure MAP
      rules and MAP in general are expected to change, this section
      is expected to be updated or even rewritten completely.</t>

      <t>Discussion: Proposed layout assumes that several simple
      options are used. Such approach simplifies implementation as it
      is much easier for implementors to reuse existing code handling
      such options. This design choice comes at a cost,
      however. Clients must perform checks if provided set of options
      is complete. Alternatively, it would be possible to define one
      complex option that contains all mandatory
      parameters. </t>

      <t>Discussion: It should be noted that initial concept of 4rd
      provisioning was presented in DHC working group meeting. It used
      one complex option to convey all required parameters. Strong
      suggestion from DHC WG was to use several simpler
      options. Options (possibly nested) are preferred over
      conditional option formatting. See DHCP option guidelines
      document <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines"/>).</t>

      <section title="MAP Options Cardinality">
        <t>MAP rule is defined in <xref target="map-design"/>, Section 4.</t>
        
        <t>Discussion: If you want additional parameter added to the
        OPTION_MAP_RULE option, please update <xref
        target="map-design"/> first.</t>

        <t>In each REPLY message, server that supports MAP configuration
        MUST include exactly one OPTION_MAP_FLAGS option.</t>

        <t>MAP_FLAGS option MUST include one or more OPTION_MAP_RULE options.</t>

        <t>For proper operation, additional parameters obtained via
        other options are necessary. In particular, L parameter is equal
        to a length of a prefix delegated to CE, conveyed in OPTION_IA_PD
        and IAPREFIX, as defined in <xref target="RFC3633"/>.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="option-flags" title="MAP Flags Option">
        <t>. This option specifies MAP
        flags. Currently the only defined flag is T - transport
        mode. 0 designates translation and 1 designates encapsulation.
        </t>
        
        <t>Each MAP_FLAGS option MUST contain one or more MAP Rule
        Options.</t>

        <t>This option represents a single MAP Rule. Depending on
        deployment mode, each CE may require one or more MAP Rules to
        operate properly.</t>

        <t>Server includes one or more MAP Rule Options in MAP Flags option.</t>

        <t>Discussion: Do we need to distinguish or reference rules?
        (i.e. Is some kind of ID field required?)</t>
        <t>Server MAY send more than one MAP Rule Option, if it is
        configured to do so. Clients MUST NOT send MAP Rule
        Option.</t>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Server Behavior">
      <t><xref target="RFC3315">RFC 3315 Section 17.2.2</xref>
      describes how a DHCPv6 client and server negotiate configuration
      values using the ORO.  As a convenience to the reader, we
      mention here that a server will not reply with a MAP Rule Option
      if the client has not explicitly enumerated it on its Option
      Request Option.</t>
      <t>Server conformant to this specification MUST allow
      configuration of one or more MAP Rule Options.</t>
      <t>Server MUST transmist all configured instances of the Mapping
      Rule Options with all sub-options, if client requested it using
      OPTION_MAP_RULE in its Option Request Option (ORO). Server MUST
      transmit MAP Flags Option if client requested OPTION_MAP_FLAGS
      in its ORO.</t>

      <t>Rules assignment is a stateless process from the server's
      perspective. Server does not need to maintain a state of rules
      provisioned to clients, track lifetimes, expire outdated rules
      etc. Server SHOULDs assign the same set of rules to all CEs in
      one MAP Domain, unless there are several classes of CEs defined,
      e.g. regular and premium users. In such case, each class of CEs
      is expected to get the same set of rules. Server is not expected
      to track MAP rules on a per CE basis. Exact assignment of
      specific rules to a specific CEs is outside of scope of this
      document.</t>
      
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Client Behavior">
      <t>Although other use cases are allowed, in typical use case CE
      will act as DHCPv6 client and will request MAP configuration to
      be assigned by the DHCPv6 server located in the ISP network. A
      client that supports MAP CE functionality and conforms to this
      specfication MUST include OPTION_MAP_RULE and OPTION_MAP_FLAGS
      in its ORO.</t>

      <t>For proper operation, MAP CE client MUST also request IPv6
      address (OPTION_IA_NA, defined in <xref target="RFC3315"/>) and
      prefix delegation (OPTION_IA_PD, defined in <xref
      target="RFC3633"/>). MAP CE client SHOULD NOT initiate DHCPv4
      configuration as all parameters are delivered over DHCPv6.</t>

      <t>Client SHOULD request OPTION_MAP_RULE and OPTION_MAP_FLAGS
      options in SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW, REBIND and
      INFORMATION-REQUEST messages.</t>

      <t>If client receives more than one OPTION_MAP_RULE option, it
      MUST use all received instances. It MUST NOT use only the first
      one, while discarding remaining ones.</t>

      <t>Note that system implementing MAP CE functionality may have
      multiple network interfaces, and these interfaces may be
      configured differently; some may be connected to networks that
      call for MAP, and some may be connected to networks that are
      using normal dual stack or other means.  The MAP CE system
      should approach this specification on an interface-by-interface
      basis.  For example, if the CE system is attached to multiple
      networks that provide the MAP Mapping Rule Option, then the CE
      system MUST configure a MAP connection (i.e. a translation or
      encapsulation) for each interface separately as each MAP
      provides IPv4 connectivity for each distinct interface. Means to
      bind a MAP configuration to a given interface in a multiple
      interfaces device are out of scope of this document.</t>
