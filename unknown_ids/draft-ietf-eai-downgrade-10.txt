Abstract

   Traditional mail systems handle only ASCII characters in SMTP
   envelope and mail header fields.  The Email Address
   Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension allows UTF-8 characters in
   SMTP envelope and mail header fields.  To avoid rejecting
   internationalized Email messages when a server in the delivery path
   does not support the UTF8SMTP extension, some sort of converting
   mechanism is required.  This document describes a downgrading
   mechanism for Email Address Internationalization.  Note that this is
   a way to downgrade, not tunnel.  There is no associated up-conversion
   mechanism, although internationalized email clients might use
   original internationalized addresses or other data when displaying or

Internet-Draft             UTF8SMTP Downgrade                   Dec 2008


1.  Introduction

   Traditional mail systems which are defined by [RFC5321] and [RFC5322]
   allow ASCII characters in SMTP envelope and mail header field values.
   The UTF8SMTP extension [RFC4952], [RFC5335] and [RFC5336] allows
   UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail header field values.

   If an envelope address or header field contains non-ASCII characters,
   the message cannot be delivered unless every system in the delivery
   path supports UTF8SMTP.  This document describes a downgrading
   mechanism to avoid rejection of such messages when a server which
   does not support the UTF8SMTP extension is encountered.  Downgrading
   mechanism converts envelope and header fields to an all-ASCII
   representation.

   [RFC5335] allows UTF-8 characters to be used in mail header fields
   and MIME header fields.  The downgrading mechanism specified here
   converts mail header fields and MIME header fields to ASCII.

   This document does not change any protocols except by defining new
   header fields.  It describes the conversion method from the
   internationalized email envelopes/messages which are defined in
   [RFC4952] [RFC5335] [RFC5336] to the traditional email envelopes/
   messages which are defined in [RFC5321] [RFC5322].

   [RFC5336] section 2.2 defines when downgrading occurs.  If the SMTP
   client has an UTF8SMTP envelope or an internationalized message and
   the SMTP server doesn't support the UTF8SMTP SMTP extension, then the
   SMTP client MUST NOT send a UTF8SMTP envelope or an internationalized
   message to the SMTP server.  The section shows 4 choices.  The fourth
   choice is downgrading, as described here.

   Downgrading may be implemented in MUAs, MSAs, MTAs which act as the
   SMTP client, or in MDAs, POP servers, IMAP servers which store or
   offer UTF8SMTP envelopes or internationalized messages to non-
   UTF8SMTP compliant systems which include message stores.

   This document tries to define the downgrading process clearly and it
   preserves the original information as much as possible.

   Downgrading in UTF8SMTP consists of the following four parts:
   o  New header fields definition
   o  SMTP downgrading
   o  Email header fields downgrading
   o  MIME header fields downgrading


   In Section 3, many header fields starting with "Downgraded-" are

   introduced.  They preserve the original envelope information and the
   original header fields.

   The SMTP downgrading is described in Section 4.  It generates ASCII
   only envelope information from an UTF8SMTP envelope.

   The Email header fields downgrading is described in Section 5.  It
   generates ASCII only header fields.

   The MIME header fields are expanded in [RFC5335].  The MIME header
   fields downgrading is described in Section 6.  It generates ASCII
   only MIME header fields.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   All specialized terms used in this specification are defined in the
   EAI overview [RFC4952] or in [RFC5321][RFC5322], MIME documents
   [RFC2045] [RFC2047] [RFC2183] [RFC2231].  The terms "ASCII address",
   "internationalized email address", "non-ASCII address", "i18mail
   address", "UTF8SMTP", "message" and "mailing list" are used with the
   definitions from [RFC4952] document.

   This document depends on [RFC5335], [RFC5336], and [RFC5337].  Key
   words used in these document are used in this document, too.

   The term "non-ASCII" is an UTF-8 string which contains at least one
   non-ASCII character.

   An "UTF8SMTP envelope" has Email originator/recipient addresses
   expanded by [RFC5336] and [RFC5337].

   An "UTF8SMTP message" is Email messages expanded by [RFC5335].


3.  New header fields definition

   New header fields starting with "Downgraded-" are defined here to
   preserve those original envelope and header values which contain
   UTF-8 characters.  During downgrading, one new "Downgraded-" header
   field is added for each original envelope or header field which
   cannot be passed as-is to a server which does not support UTF8SMTP.
   The original envelope or header field is removed or rewritten.  Only
   those envelope and header fields which contain non-ASCII characters

   are affected.  The result of this process is a message which is
   compliant with existing email specifications [RFC5321] and [RFC5322].
   The original internationalized information can be retrieved by
   examining the "Downgraded-" header fields which were added.  Even
   though the information is not lost, the original message cannot be
   perfectly reconstructed.  Hence, downgrading is a one-way process.
   However, an internationalized client might use the information in the
   "Downgraded-" header fields when processing a downgraded message, for
   example, such as displaying or composing a reply.

3.1.  Envelope information preservation headers

   SMTP envelope downgraded information <downgraded-envelope-addr>
   consists of the original non-ASCII address and the downgraded all-
   ASCII address.

   downgraded-envelope-addr = [FWS] "<" [ A-d-l ":" ] uMailbox
           FWS "<" Mailbox ">" ">" [CFWS]

   <uMailbox> is defined in [RFC5336]; <Mailbox> and <A-d-l> are defined
   in [RFC5321], section 4.1.2.

   Two headers "Downgraded-Mail-From:" and "Downgraded-Rcpt-To:" are
   defined to preserve SMTP envelope downgraded information.  The header
   field syntax is specified as follows:

   fields             =/ downgradedmailfrom / downgradedrcptto
   downgradedmailfrom =  "Downgraded-Mail-From:" unstructured CRLF
   downgradedrcptto   =  "Downgraded-Rcpt-To:"   unstructured CRLF

   The unstructured content is downgraded-envelope-addr treated as if it
   were unstructured with [RFC2047] encoding (and charset UTF-8) as
   needed.

3.2.  Address header field preservation headers

   The address header fields preservation headers are defined to
   preserve the original header field.  Their value field holds the
   original header field value.  The header field syntax is specified as
   follows:


   fields =/ known-downgraded-headers ":" unstructured CRLF
   known-downgraded-headers =  "Downgraded-" original-headers
   original-headers         = "From" / "To" / "Cc" / "Bcc" /
                              "Sender" / "Reply-To" /
                              "Resent-From" / "Resent-Sender" /
                              "Resent-To" / "Resent-Cc" / "Return-Path"

   Preserving a header field in a downgraded header field is defined as:
   1.  Generate new downgraded header field whose value is the original
       header field value.
   2.  Treat the generated header field content as if it were
       unstructured, and then apply [RFC2047] encoding with charset
       UTF-8 as necessary so the result is ASCII.

3.3.  Unknown header fields preservation headers

   The unknown header fields preservation headers are defined to
   encapsulate those original header fields which contain non-ASCII
   characters and are not otherwise provided for in the this
   specification.  The encapsulation header field name is the
   concatenation of "Downgraded-" and the original name.  The value
   field holds the original header field value.

   The header field syntax is specified as follows:


  fields     =/ unknown-downgraded-headers ":" unstructured CRLF
  unknown-downgraded-headers =  "Downgraded-" original-header-field-name
  original-header-field-name = field-name

  field-name      =       1*ftext

  ftext           =       %d33-57 /               ; Any character except
                          %d59-126                ;  controls, SP, and
                                                  ;  ":".


   Encapsulating a header field in a "Downgraded-" header field is
   defined as:
   1.  Generate new "Downgraded-" header field whose value is the
       original header field value.
   2.  Treat the generated header field content as if it were
       unstructured, and then apply [RFC2047] encoding with charset
       UTF-8 as necessary so the result is ASCII.
   3.  Remove the original header field.

   Applying this procedure to "Received" header field is prohibited.


4.  SMTP Downgrading

   Target of downgrading elements in SMTP envelope are below:

Internet-Draft             UTF8SMTP Downgrade                   Dec 2008


   o  <reverse-path> of MAIL FROM command
   o  <forward-path> of RCPT TO command
   o  ORCPT parameter of RCPT TO command

4.1.  Path element downgrading

   Downgrading the <path> of MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands uses ALT-
   ADDRESS parameter defined in [RFC5336].  A SMTP command is
   downgradable if the <path> contains non-ASCII address and the command
   has an ALT-ADDRESS parameter which specifies an ASCII address.  Since
   only non-ASCII addresses are downgradable, specifying an ALT-ADDRESS
   value for an all-ASCII address is invalid for use with this
   specification, and no interpretation is assigned to it.  This
   restriction allows for future extension of the specification even
   though no such extensions are currently anticipated.

   Note that even if no downgrading is performed on the envelope,
   message header fields and message body MIME header fields that
   contain non-ASCII characters MUST be downgraded.  This is described
   in Section 5 and Section 6.

   When downgrading, replace each <path> which contains non-ASCII mail
   address with its specified alternative ASCII address and preserve the
   original information using "Downgraded-Mail-From" and "Downgraded-
   Rcpt-To" header fields as defined in Section 3.  Before replacing,
   decode the ALT-ADDRESS parameter value because it is encoded as xtext
   [RFC3461].

   To avoid disclosing recipient addresses, the downgrading process MUST
   NOT add "Downgraded-Rcpt-To:" header if the SMTP downgrading targets
   multiple recipients.  See Section 7 for more detail.

   As a result of the recipient address downgrading, the domain part of
   the recipient address prior to downgrading might be different from
   the domain part of the new recipient address.  If the result of
   address resolution for the domain part of the new recipient address
   contains the server at the connection destination of the SMTP session
   for the recipient address prior to downgrading, the SMTP connection
   is valid for the new recipient address.  Otherwise, the downgrading
   process MUST NOT send the downgraded message to the new recipient
   address via the connection and MUST try to send the downgraded
   message to the new recipient address.

4.2.  ORCPT downgrading

   The "RCPT TO" command can have an ORCPT parameter if the DSN
   extension [RFC3461] is supported.  If the ORCPT parameter contains an
   "utf-8" type address and the address contains raw non-ASCII

Internet-Draft             UTF8SMTP Downgrade                   Dec 2008


   characters, the address MUST be converted to utf-8-addr-unitext form
   or utf-8-addr-xtext form which are described in [RFC5337].

   The utf-8-addr-unitext transformation that needs to occur on the
   content of ORCPT is to
   1.  remove xtext encoding.
   2.  convert the result of step 1 to utf-8-addr-unitext form where all
       non-ASCII characters and '\' are represented as
       EmbeddedUnicodeChar.
   3.  re-apply xtext encoding to the result of step 2.


5.  Email header fields downgrading

   This section defines the conversion method to ASCII for each header
   field which may contain non-ASCII characters.

   [RFC5335] expands Received: header fields, [RFC5322] ABNF elements
   <mailbox>, <word>, <comment>, <unstructured>, [RFC2045] ABNF element
   <value>.

   Header field downgrading is defined below for each ABNF element.
   Downgrading an unknown header field is also defined as ENCAPSULATION
   downgrading.  Converting the header field terminates when no non-
   ASCII characters remain in the header field.

   RECEIVED downgrading:
      If the header field name is "Received:" and the FOR clause
      contains a non-ASCII addresses, remove the FOR clause from the
      header field.  Other parts (not counting <comment>s) don't contain
      non-ASCII values.

   UNSTRUCTURED downgrading:
      If the header field has an <unstructured> field which contains
      non-ASCII characters, apply [RFC2047] encoding with charset UTF-8.

   WORD downgrading:
      If the header field has any <word> fields which contains non-ASCII
      characters, apply [RFC2047] encoding with charset UTF-8.

   COMMENT downgrading:
      If the header field has any <comment> fields which contains non-
      ASCII characters, apply [RFC2047] encoding with charset UTF-8.

Internet-Draft             UTF8SMTP Downgrade                   Dec 2008


   MIME-VALUE downgrading:
      If the header field has any <value> elements defined by [RFC2045]
      and the elements contain non-ASCII characters, encode the <value>
      elements by [RFC2231] with charset UTF-8 and the Language
      information empty.  If the <value> element is <quoted-string> and
      it contains <CFWS> outside the DQUOTE, remove the <CFWS> before
      this conversion.

   DISPLAY-NAME downgrading:
      If the header field has any <address> (<mailbox> and <group>)
      elements and they have <display-name> elements which contain non-
      ASCII characters, encode the <display-name> elements according to
      [RFC2047] with charset UTF-8.  DISPLAY-NAME downgrading is the
      same algorithm as WORD downgrading.

   MAILBOX downgrading:
      The <mailbox> elements have no equivalent format for non-ASCII
      addresses.  If the header field has any <mailbox> elements which
      contain non-ASCII characters, preserve the header field in each
      Address header field preservation header defined in Section 3.2,
      and rewrite each <mailbox> element to ASCII only format.  The
      <mailbox> element which contains non-ASCII characters is one of
      three formats.

      *  [ Display-name ] "<" Utf8-addr-spec 1*FCS "<" Addr-spec ">>"

         Rewrite it as

         [ Display-name ] "<" Addr-spec ">"

      *  [ Display-name ] "<" Utf8-addr-spec ">"
      *  Utf8-addr-spec

         Rewrite both as
         [ Display-name ] "Internationalized Address " Encoded-word
         " Removed:;"

         where the <Encoded-word> is the original <Utf8-addr-spec>
         encoded according to [RFC2047].

   ENCAPSULATION downgrading:
      if the header field contains non-ASCII characters and for which no
      rule is given above, encapsulate it in a Downgraded header field
      described in Section 3.3 as a last resort.

   TYPED-ADDRESS downgrading:
      If the header field contains <utf-8-type-addr> defined in
      [RFC5337] and the <utf-8-type-addr> contains raw non-ASCII
      characters, it is utf-8-address form and convert it to utf-8-addr-
      xtext form or utf-8-addr-unitext form.  COMMENT downgrading is
      also performed in this case.  If the address type is unrecognized
      and the header contains non-ASCII characters, then fall back to
      using ENCAPSULATION downgrading on the entire header.


5.1.  Downgrading method for each header field

   Header fields are listed in [RFC4021].  This section describes the
   downgrading method for each header field.

   If the whole mail header field does not contain non-ASCII characters,
   email header field downgrading is not required.  Each header field's
   downgrading method is described below.

   o  Other header fields

      All other header fields which contains non-ASCII characters are
      user-defined, missing from this draft or future defined header
      fields.  Perform ENCAPSULATION downgrading.

      If the software understands the header's structure and a
      downgrading algorithm other than ENCAPSULATION is applicable, that
      software SHOULD use that algorithm; ENCAPSULATION downgrading is
      used as a last resort.

      Any List-* header field containing non-ASCII characters will be
      turned into Downgraded-List-* header fields.


6.  MIME body part headers downgrading

   MIME body part header fields may contain non-ASCII characters
   [RFC5335].  This section defines the conversion method to ASCII only
   header fields for each MIME header field which contains non-ASCII
   characters.  Parse the message body's MIME structure for all levels
   and check each MIME header field whether it contains non-ASCII
   characters.  If the header field contains non-ASCII characters in the
   header value, the header is a target of the MIME body part headers
   downgrading.  Each MIME header field's downgrading method is
   described below.  COMMENT downgrading, MIME-VALUE downgrading,
   UNSTRUCTURED downgrading are described in Section 5.

   Content-ID:
      The Content-ID: header does not contain non-ASCII characters
      except in comments.  If the header contains UTF-8 characters in
      comments, perform COMMENT downgrading.

   Content-Type:
   Content-Disposition:
      Perform MIME-VALUE downgrading and COMMENT downgrading.

   Content-Description:
      Perform UNSTRUCTURED downgrading.

7.  Security considerations

   o  A Downgraded message's header fields contain ASCII characters
      only.  But they still contain MIME encapsulated header fields
      which contains non-ASCII UTF-8 characters.  Furthermore, the body
      part may contain UTF-8 characters.  Implementations parsing
      Internet messages need to accept UTF-8 body parts and UTF-8 header
      fields which are MIME encoded.  Thus it inherits the security
      considerations of MIME encoded headers [RFC2047] and [RFC3629].
   o  Rewriting headers increases the opportunities for undetected
      spoofing.  However rewritten header fields are preserved into
      Downgraded-* header fields and parsing Downgraded-* header fields
      enables detecting spoofing caused by downgrading.

   o  Addresses that do not appear in the message headers may appear in
      the RCPT commands to an SMTP server for a number of reasons.
      Copying information from the Envelope into headers risks
      inadvertent information disclosure (see [RFC5321] and Section 4).
      Mitigating inadvertent information disclosure is discussed in same
      place.

   o  The techniques described here invalidates methods that depend on
      digital signatures over the envelope or any part of the message
      which includes the top-level header or body part headers.
      Depending on the specific message being downgraded, DKIM
      especially, but also possibly S/MIME, PGP, and similar techniques
      are all likely to break.  The two obvious mitigations are to stick
      to 7-bit transport when using these techniques (as most/all of
      them presently require), or make sure you have UTF8SMTP end-to-end
      when needed.

   o  Many gateways and servers on the Internet will discard headers
      with which they are not familiar.  To the extent to which the
      downgrade procedures depend on new headers (e.g., "Downgraded-")
      to avoid information loss, the risk of having those headers
      dropped and its implications must be identified.  In particular,
      if the Downgraded headers are dropped, there is no possibility of
      reconstructing the original information at any point (before,
      during, or after delivery).  Such gateways violate [RFC2979] and
      can be upgraded to correct the problem.


   See "Security considerations" section in [RFC4952] for more
   discussion.

8.  Implementation notes

8.1.  RFC 2047 encoding

   While [RFC2047] has a specific algorithm to deal with whitespace in
   adjacent encoded-words, there are a number of deployed
   implementations that fail to implement the algorithm correctly.  As a
   result, whitespace behavior is somewhat unpredictable in practice
   when multiple encoded words are used.  While RFC 5322 states that
   implementations SHOULD limit lines to not more than 78 characters,
   implementations MAY choose to allow overlong encoded words in order
   to work around faulty [RFC2047] implementations.  Implementations
   that choose to do so SHOULD have an optional mechanism to limit line
   length to 78 characters.

8.2.  Trivial downgrading

   Downgrading is an alternative to avoid the rejection of messages
   which require UTF8SMTP support by a server which does not provide
   this.  Implementing the full specification of this document is
   desirable, but a partial implementation is also possible.

   If a partial downgrading implementation confronts an unsupported
   downgrading target, the implementation MUST NOT send the message to a
   server which does not support UTF8SMTP.  Instead, it MUST reject the
   message or generate a notification of non-deliverability.

   A partial downgrading, Trivial downgrading is discussed.  It does not
   support non-ASCII addresses in SMTP envelope and address header
   fields, unknown header fields downgrading, the MIME body part headers
   downgrading.  It supports
   o  some simple header fields downgrading: Subject
   o  comments and display name downgrading: From, To, Cc
   o  trace header field downgrading: Received

   Otherwise, the downgrading fails.

   Trivial downgrading targets mail messages which are generated by
   UTF8SMTP aware MUAs and contain non-ASCII characters in comments,
   display names, unstructured parts without using non-ASCII E-mail
   addresses.  This mail message does not contain non-ASCII E-mail
   addresses in the SMTP Envelope and its header fields.  But it is not
   deliverable via a UTF8SMTP un-aware SMTP server.  Implementing full
   specification downgrading may be hard, but trivial downgrading saves
   mail messages without using non-ASCII addresses.

8.3.  7bit transport consideration

   The SMTP client may encounter a SMTP server which does not support
   the 8BITMIME SMTP extension [RFC1652].  The server does not support
   "8bit" or "binary" data.  Implementers need to consider converting
   "8bit" data to "base64" or "quoted-printable" encoded form and adjust
   the "Content-Transfer-Encoding" header field accordingly.  If the
   body contains multiple MIME parts, this conversion MUST be performed
   for each MIME part.

   IANA is requested to register the following header fields in the
   Permanent Message Header Field Repository, in accordance with the

A.2.  Downgrading example 2

   In many cases, the sender wants to use non-ASCII address and the
   recipient is a traditional mail user.  The SMTP server handing mail
   for the recipient and/or the recipient's MUA does not support
   UTF8SMTP extension.  Consider a mail message where:
   o  The sender address is "NON-ASCII-local@example.com" which is a
      non-ASCII address.  Its ASCII alternative is
      "ASCII-local@example.com".  It has a display-name "DISPLAY-local"
      which contains non-ASCII characters.
   o  The "To:" address is "ASCII-remote1@example.net" which is ASCII
      only.  It has a display-name "DISPLAY-remote1" which contains non-
      ASCII characters.
   o  The "Subject:" header is "NON-ASCII-SUBJECT" which contains non-
      ASCII characters.
   The second example envelope/message is shown in Figure 4.
