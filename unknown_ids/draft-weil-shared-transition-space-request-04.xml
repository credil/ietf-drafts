    <abstract>
      <t>This document requests a reserved IANA IPv4 address allocation as
      Shared Transition Space to support the deployment of IPv4 address
      sharing technologies post IPv4 exhaustion</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Many operators are currently implementing their IPv6 transition
      plans. During the transition, continued support for heritage IPv4-only
      devices will be required. In order to facilitate the deployment of
      transition technologies to support such heritage IPv4-only devices and
      services, Service Providers require IPv4 address space that is separate
      from the range of IPv4 addresses used by subscribers. This address space
      need not be unique to each provider, but should be outside of <xref
      target="RFC1918"></xref> space. This document requests that an IPv4 /10
      be reserved as Shared Transition Space solely to facilitate deployment
      of IPv6 transition/IPv4 coexistence technologies.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Applicability">
      <t>The Internet community is rapidly consuming the remaining supply of
      unallocated IPv4 addresses. During the transition period to IPv6, it is
      imperative that Service Providers maintain IPv4 service for devices and
      networks that are currently incapable of upgrading to IPv6.</t>

      <t>The applicability of and justification for Shared Transition Space is
      described in <xref
      target="I-D.bdgks-arin-shared-transition-space"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Shared Transition Space">
      <t>This document proposes the assignment of a /10 as Shared Transition
      Space. Shared Transition Space is IPv4 address space reserved for
      Infrastructure Provider use with the purpose of facilitating IPv6
      transition and IPv4 coexistence deployment. The requested block SHOULD
      NOT be utilized for any purpose other than as "inside" addresses in a
      carrier NAT environment (e.g., between the CGN and customer CPE devices)
      or for other IPv4 to IPv6 transition infrastructure. Network equipment
      manufacturers MUST NOT use the assigned block in default or example
      device configurations.</t>

      <t>Because Shared Transition addresses have no meaning outside of the
      Infrastructure Provider, routing information about shared transition
      space networks MUST NOT be propagated on interdomain links, and packets
      with shared transition source or destination addresses SHOULD NOT be
      forwarded across such links. Internet service providers SHOULD filter
      out routing information about shared transition space networks on
      ingress links.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This memo does not define any protocol, and raises no security
      issues. Any addresses allocated as Shared Transition Space would not be
      routable on the Internet.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is asked to record the allocation of an IPv4 /10 for use as
      Shared Transition Space.</t>
