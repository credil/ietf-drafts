   Group.

   THIS INTERNET DRAFT IS WRITTEN TO FACILITATE PROCESSING WITHIN THE
   IESG.  IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE PUBLISHED AS AN RFC.


1.  Introduction

   A preliminary evaluation has been made of SMTP Service Extension for
   8bit-MIMEtransport [RFC1652] by the Yet Another Mail (YAM) Working
   Group for advancing it from Draft to Full Standard.  The YAM WG
   requests feedback from the IESG on this decision.

1.1.  Note to RFC Editor

   This Internet-Draft is not meant to be published as an RFC.  It is
   written to facilitate processing within the IESG.


2.  Preliminary Evaluation

   Title:   SMTP Service Extension for 8bit-MIMEtransport

   Link:   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1652

   Time in Place:



      RFC2026:   _"A specification shall remain at the Draft Standard
         level for at least four (4) months, or until at least one IETF
         meeting has occurred."_

      Published:   July 1994

   Confidence document meets RFC 2026 section 4.1.3 (Standard) test:



      RFC2026:   _"significant implementation and successful operational
         experience...[with] a high degree of technical maturity and []
         a generally held belief that the specified protocol or service
         provides significant benefit to the Internet community."_

      In the 15 years since publication, this specification has become
      an integral part of all professional SMTP software products and is
      widely supported in Internet Mail operations.  There are no RFC
      Errata on this specification.

      The universal deployment of this feature is well-known to many YAM
      working group participants.  In addition, the working group is
      obtaining explicit statements of deployment for specific SMTP
      implementations.

   Proposed Changes (the YAM WG proposes making the following changes in
   a revision:



      RFC2026:   _"Minor revisions are expected, but a significant
         revision may require that the specification accumulate more
         experience at its current maturity level before progressing."_

      Add reference to [RFC5321].  Retain reference to [RFC0821].

      Add reference to [RFC5322].  Retain reference to [RFC0822].

      Add reference to [RFC2045].  Retain reference to [RFC1521].

      Add reference to [RFC2046].  Retain reference to [RFC1522].

      Remove reference to [RFC1651].  Obsoleted by [RFC2821] and
      [RFC5321].

   Non-Changes (the YAM WG discussed and chose not to make the following
   changes):

      None.

   Downward references (At Full Standard, the following references would
   be downward references):

      [RFC5321], [RFC5322], [RFC2045], [RFC2046].

      NOTE:   The YAM working group currently has the goal of also
         moving these documents to Full Standard.


3.  IESG Feedback

   The YAM WG requests feedback from the IESG on these decisions.  In
   particular:

   o  Does the IESG believe the proposed changes are suitable during a
      move from Draft to Full Standard?

   o  Does the IESG believe any other proposed changes are necessary to
      satisfy IESG requirements to advance to Full Standard?

   o  Does the IESG consider the downward references acceptable for a
      Full Standard?


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no IANA actions.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document requests IESG feedback.  There are no security
   considerations.
