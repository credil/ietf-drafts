   Wireless Access Systems.  The 802.16 specification includes several
   service specific convergence sublayers (CS) as part of the MAC
   (Medium Access Control) layer which are used by upper layer
   protocols.  The ATM CS and Packet CS are the two main service
   specific convergence sublayers and these are a part of the 802.16 MAC
   to which the upper layers interface.  The packet CS is used for
   transport for all packet-based protocols such as Internet Protocol
   (IP), IEEE 802.3 LAN/MAN CSMA/CD Access Method (Ethernet) and, IEEE
   Std 802.1Q (VLAN).  The IP specific part of the Packet CS enables
   transport of IPv4 and IPv6 packets directly over the MAC.  This
   document specifies the addressing and operation of IPv6 over the IP
   specific part of the packet CS for hosts served by a network that
   utilizes the IEEE Std 802.16 air interface.  It recommends the
   assignment of a unique prefix (or prefixes) to each host and allows
   the host to use multiple identifiers within that prefix, including
   support for randomly generated interface identifiers.

2.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.16e is an air interface for fixed and mobile broadband
   wireless access systems.  Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
   (OFDM) is the basis of the air interface.  The standard specifies the
   air interface, including the medium access control (MAC) layer and
   multiple physical layer (PHY) specifications.  It can be deployed in
   licensed as well as unlicensed spectrum.  While the PHY and MAC are
   specified in IEEE 802.16, the details of IPv4 and IPv6 operation over
   the air interface are not included.  This document specifies the
   operation of IPv6 over the IEEE 802.16 air interface.

   IPv6 packets can be carried over the IEEE Std 802.16 specified air
   interface via :

   1.  the IP specific part of the Packet CS or,
   2.  the 802.3 [802.3] specific part of the Packet CS or,
   3.  the 802.1Q [802.1Q] specific part of the Packet CS.

   The 802.16 [802.16] specification includes the Phy and MAC details.
   The convergence sublayers are a part of the MAC.  This document
   specifies IPv6 from the perspective of the transmission of IPv6 over
   the IP specific part of the packet convergence sublayer.

   The mobile station/host is attached to an access router via a base
   station (BS).  The host and the BS are connected via the IEEE Std
   802.16 air interface at the link and physical layers.  The IPv6 link
   from the MS terminates at an access router which may be a part of the
   BS or an entity beyond the BS.  The base station is a layer 2 entity
   (from the perspective of the IPv6 link between the MS and AR) and
   relays the IPv6 packets between the AR and the host via a point-to-
   point connection over the air interface.


3.  Terminology

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in IP
   over 802.16 Problem Statement and Goals [I-D.ietf-16ng-ps-goals].

4.  IEEE 802.16 convergence sublayer support for IPv6

   The IEEE 802.16 MAC specifies two main service specific convergence
   sublayers:

   1.  ATM Convergence sublayer
   2.  Packet Convergence sublayer

   The Packet CS is used for the transport of packet based protocols
   which include:

   1.  IEEE Std 802.3(Ethernet)
   2.  IEEE Std 802.1Q(VLAN)
   3.  Internet Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6)

   The service specific CS resides on top of the MAC Common Part
   Sublayer (CPS).  The service specific CS is responsible for:

   o  accepting packets (PDUs) from the upper layer,
   o  performing classification of the packet/PDU based on a set of
      classifiers that are defined which are service specific,
   o  delivering the CS PDU to the appropriate service flow and
      transport connection and,
   o  receiving PDUs from the peer entity.

   Payload header suppression (PHS) is also a function of the CS but is
   optional.

   The figure below shows the concept of the service specific CS in
   relation to the MAC:

   Classifiers for each of the specific upper-layer protocols, i.e
   Ethernet, VLAN and IP, are defined in the IEEE 802.16 specification,
   which enable the packets from the upper layer to be processed by the
   appropriate service specific part of the packet CS.  IPv6 can be
   transported directly over the IP specific part of the packet CS or
   over 802.3/Ethernet (which in turn is handled by the Ethernet
   specific part of the packet CS) or over 802.1Q (which is handled by
   the 802.1Q specific part of the packet CS).  IPv6 over the IP
   specific part of the packet CS SHOULD be the default method for IPv6
   packet transmission.  IPv4 packets also are transported over the IP
   specific part of the packet CS.  The classifiers enable the
   differentiation of IPv4 and IPv6 packets and mapping to specific
   transport connections over the air-interface.

   The figure below shows the options for IPv6 transport over the packet
   CS of 802.16:

   The scope of this document is limited to IPv6 operation over the IP
   specific part of the Packet CS only.  Hence, the resulting interface
   is capable of IPv6 only.  IPv4 over the IP specific part of the
   packet CS is specified elsewhere by the 16ng WG, and the resulting
   interface is capable of IPv4 only.  A host with both types of
   interfaces is therefore a dual-stack host.

   It should be noted that immediately after ranging (802.16 air
   interface procedure), the MS and BS exchange their capability
   negotiation via REG-REQ (Registration Request) and REG-RSP
   (Registration Response) 802.16 MAC messages.  These management frames
   negotiate parameters such as the Convergence Sublayer support.  By
   default, Packet, IPv4 and 802.3/Ethernet are supported.  IPv6 via the
   Packet CS is supported by the MS and the BS only when the IPv6
   support bit in the capability negotiation messages (REG-REQ and REG-
   RSP) implying such support is indicated in the parameter
   "Classification/PHS options and SDU (Service Data Unit) encapsulation
   support" (Refer to [802.16]).  Additionally during the establishment
   of the transport connection for transporting IPv6 packets, the DSA-
   REQ (Dynamic Service Addition) and DSA-RSP messages between the BS
   and MS indicate via the CS-Specification TLV the CS that the
   connection being setup shall use.  When the IPv6 packet is preceded
   by the 802.16 six byte MAC header there is no specific indication in
   the MAC header itself about the payload type.  The processing of the
   packet is based entirely on the classifiers.  Based on the
   classification rules, the MAC layer selects an appropriate transport
   connection for the transmission of the packet.  An IPv6 packet is
   transported over a transport connection that is specifically
   established for carrying such packets.

   Transmission of IPv6 as explained above is possible via multiple
   methods, i.e, via the IP specific part of the packet CS or via
   Ethernet or 802.1Q interfaces.  The choice of which method to use is
   implementation specific.  When IPv6 is carried via the IP convergence
   sublayer, this specification SHOULD be followed.  In order to ensure
   interoperability the BS SHOULD support the IP specific part of the
   packet CS and the Ethernet specific part of the packet CS for IPv6
   transport.  Hosts which may implement one or the other method for
   transmission would be assured of the ability to establish a transport
   connection that would enable the transport of IPv6 packets.
   Inability to negotiate a common convergence sublayer for the
   transport connection between the MS and BS will result in failure to
   setup the transport connection and thereby render the host unable to
   send and receive IPv6 packets.  In the case of a host which
   implements more than one method of transporting IPv6 packets, the
   choice of which method to use (i.e IPv6 over the IP specific part of
   the packet CS or IPv6 over 802.3 or, IPv6 over 802.1Q) is
   implementation specific.  The host and the BS SHOULD support the
   transmission of IPv6 over the IP specific part of the packet
   convergence sublayer.  The default method for IPv6 packet
   transmission over 802.16 should be via the packet CS.

4.1.  IPv6 encapsulation over the IP CS of the MAC

   The IPv6 payload when carried over the IP specific part of the Packet
   CS is encapsulated by the 6 byte 802.16 generic MAC header.  The
   format of the IPv6 packet encapsulated by the generic MAC header is
   shown in the figure below.  The format of the 6 byte MAC header is
   described in the [802.16] specification.  The CRC (cyclic redundancy
   check) is optional.  It should be noted that the actual MAC address
   is not included in the MAC header.



             ---------/ /-----------
             |    MAC SDU          |
             --------/ /------------

                     ||
      MSB            \/                                    LSB
      ---------------------------------------------------------
      | Generic MAC header|  IPv6 Payload              | CRC  |
      ---------------------------------------------------------


                       Figure 3: IPv6 encapsulation

   For transmission of IPv6 packets via the IP specific part of the
   Packet CS of 802.16, the IPv6 layer interfaces with the 802.16 MAC
   directly.  The IPv6 layer delivers the IPv6 packet to the Packet CS
   of the 802.16.  The packet CS defines a set of classifiers that are
   used to determine how to handle the packet.  The IP classifiers that
   are used at the MAC operate on the fields of the IP header and the
   transport protocol and these include the IP Traffic class, Next
   header field, Masked IP source and destination addresses and,
   Protocol source and destination port ranges.  Next header in this
   case refers to the last header of the IP header chain.  Using the
   classifiers, the MAC maps an upper layer packet to a specific service
   flow and transport connection to be used.  The MAC encapsulates the
   IPv6 packet in the 6 byte MAC header (MAC SDU) and transmits it.  The
   figure below shows the operation on the downlink, i.e the
   transmission from the BS to the host.  The reverse is applicable for
   the uplink transmission.

5.  Generic network architecture using the 802.16 air interface

   In a network that utilizes the 802.16 air interface the host/MS is
   attached to an IPv6 access router (AR) in the network.  The BS is a
   layer 2 entity only.  The AR can be an integral part of the BS or the
   AR could be an entity beyond the BS within the access network.  IPv6
   packets between the MS and BS are carried over a point-to-point
   transport connection which has a unique connection identifier (CID).
   The transport connection is a MAC layer link between the MS and the
   BS.  The figures below describe the possible network architectures
   and are generic in nature.  More esoteric architectures are possible
   but not considered in the scope of this document.  Option A:

6.  IPv6 link

   Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis] defines
   link as a communication facility or medium over which nodes can
   communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer immediately below IP .
   A link is bounded by routers that decrement the Hop limit field in
   the IPv6 header.  When an MS moves within a link, it can keep using
   its IP addresses.  This is a layer 3 definition and note that the
   definition is not identical with the definition of the term '(L2)
   link' in IEEE 802 standards.

6.1.  IPv6 link in 802.16

   In 802.16, the Transport Connection between an MS and a BS is used to
   transport user data, i.e.  IPv6 packets in this case.  A Transport
   Connection is represented by a CID (Connection Identifier) and
   multiple Transport Connections can exist between an MS and BS.

   When an AR and a BS are collocated, the collection of Transport
   Connections to an MS is defined as a single link.  When an AR and a
   BS are separated, it is recommended that a tunnel is established
   between the AR and a BS whose granuality is no greater than 'per MS'
   or 'per service flow' ( An MS can have multiple service flows which
   are identified by a service flow ID).  Then the tunnel(s) for an MS,
   in combination with the MS's Transport connections, forms a single

Internet-Draft        IPv6 over Packet CS in 802.16           March 2007


   point-to-point link.

   The collection of service flows (tunnels) to an MS is defined as a
   single link.  Each link has only an MS and an AR.  Each MS belongs to
   a different link.  A different prefix should be assigned to each
   unique link.  This link is fully consistent with a standard IP link,
   without exception and conforms with the definition of a point-to-
   point link in Neighbor discovery for IPv6 [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis].
   Hence the point-to-point link model for IPv6 operation over the IP
   specific part of the Packet CS in 802.16 SHOULD be used.  A unique
   IPv6 prefix(es) per link (MS/host) MUST be assigned.

6.2.  IPv6 link establishment in 802.16

   In order to enable the sending and receiving of IPv6 packets between
   the MS and the AR, the link between the MS and the AR via the BS
   needs to be established.  This section illustrates the link
   establishment procedure.

   The MS goes through the network entry procedure as specified by
   802.16.  A high level description of the network entry procedure is
   as follows:

   1.  MS performs initial ranging with the BS.  Ranging is a process by
       which an MS becomes time aligned with the BS.  The MS is
       synchronized with the BS at the succesful completion of ranging
       and is ready to setup a connection.
   2.  MS and BS perform capability exchange as per 802.16 procedures.
       The CS capability parameter indicates which classification/PHS
       options and SDU encapsulation the MS supports.  By default,
       Packet, IPv4 and 802.3/Ethernet shall be supported, thus absence
       of this parameter in REG-REQ (802.16 message) means that named
       options are supported by the MS/SS.  Support for IPv6 over the IP
       specific part of the packet CS is indicated by Bit#2 of the CS
       capability parameter (Refer to [802.16]).
   3.  The MS progresses to an authentication phase.  Authentication is
       based on PKMv2 as defined in the IEEE Std 802.16 specification.
   4.  On succesful completion of authentication, the MS performs 802.16
       registration with the network.
   5.  The MS MUST request the establishment of a service flow for IPv6
       packets over the IP specific part of the Packet CS.  The service
       flow MAY also be triggered by the network as a result of pre-
       provisioning.  The service flow establishes a link between the MS
       and the AR over which IPv6 packets can be sent and received.
   6.  The AR and MS should send router advertisements and solicitations
       as specified in Neighbor discovery,[I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis].

   The above flow does not show the actual 802.16 messages that are used

Internet-Draft        IPv6 over Packet CS in 802.16           March 2007


   for ranging, capability exchange or service flow establishment.
   Details of these are in [802.16].

6.3.  Maximum transmission unit in 802.16

   The MTU value for IPv6 packets on an 802.16 link is configurable.
   The default MTU for IPv6 packets over an 802.16 link MUST be 1500
   octets.

   The 802.16 MAC PDU (Protocol Data Unit) is composed of a 6 byte
   header followed by an optional payload and an optional CRC covering
   the header and the payload.  The length of the PDU is indicated by
   the Len parameter in the Generic MAC Header.  The Len parameter has a
   size of 11 bits.  Hence the total PDU size is 2048 bytes.  The IPv6
   payload can be a max value of 2038 bytes ( Total PDU size minus (MAC
   Header + CRC)).  Hence the Max value of the IPv6 MTU for 802.16 links
   is 2038 bytes.  In certain deployment scenarios the MTU value can be
   greater than the default.  Neighbor Discovery for IPv6
   [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis] defines an MTU option that an AR can
   advertise, via router advertisement (RA), to an MN.  The MTU option
   advertised to an MN SHOULD be in the range of 1280 to 2038 bytes.  If
   an AR advertises an MTU via the RA MTU option, the MN SHOULD use the
   MTU from the RA.  Nodes that implement Path MTU discovery [RFC1981]
   MAY use the mechanism to determine the MTU for the IPv6 packets.


7.  IPv6 prefix assignment

   The MS and the AR are connected via a point-to-point connection at
   the IPv6 layer.  Hence each MS can be considered to be on a separate
   subnet.  A CPE (Customer Premise Equipment) type of device which
   serves multiple IPv6 hosts, may be the end point of the connection.
   Hence one or more /64 prefixes SHOULD be assigned to a link.  The
   prefixes are advertised with the on-link (L-bit) flag set as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis].  The size and number of the
   prefixes is a configuration issue.  Also, prefix delegation MAY be
   used to provide additional prefixes for a router connected over
   802.16.  The other properties of the prefixes are also dealt via
   configuration.


8.  Router Discovery

8.1.  Router Solicitation

   On completion of the establishment of the IPv6 link, the MS may send
   a router solicitation message to solicit a Router Advertisement
   message from the AR to acquire necessary information as per the



Patil, et al.          Expires September 13, 2007              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        IPv6 over Packet CS in 802.16           March 2007


   neighbor discovery for IPv6 specification [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis].
   An MS that is network attached may also send router solicitations at
   any time.  Movement detection at the IP layer of an MS in many cases
   is based on receiving periodic router advertisements.  An MS may also
   detect changes in its attachment via link triggers or other means.
   The MS can act on such triggers by sending router solicitations.  The
   router solicitation is sent over the IPv6 link that has been
   previously established.  The MS sends router solicitations to the
   all-routers multicast address.  It is carried over the point-to-point
   link to the AR via the BS.  The MS does not need to be aware of the
   link-local address of the AR in order to send a router solicitation
   at any time.

8.2.  Router Advertisement

   The AR should send a number (configurable value) of router
   advertisements as soon as the IPv6 link is established, to the MS.
   The AR sends unsolicited router advertisements periodically as per
   [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis].  The interval between periodic router
   advertisements is however greater than the specification in Neighbor
   discovery for IPv6, and is discussed in the following section.

8.3.  Router lifetime and periodic router advertisements

   The router lifetime SHOULD be set to a large value, preferably in
   hours.  This document over-rides the specification for the value of
   the router lifetime in Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)
   [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis].  The AdvDefaultLifetime in the router
   advertisement MUST be either zero or between MaxRtrAdvInterval and
   43200 seconds.  The default value is 2 * MaxRtrAdvInterval.

   802.16 hosts have the capability to transition to an idle mode in
   which case the radio link between the BS and MS is torn down.  Paging
   is required in case the network needs to deliver packets to the MS.
   In order to avoid waking a mobile which is in idle mode and consuming
   resources on the air interface, the interval between periodic router
   advertisements SHOULD be set quite high.  The MaxRtrAdvInterval value
   specified in this document over-rides the recommendation in Neighbor
   Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6) [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis].  The
   MaxRtrAdvInterval MUST be no less than 4 seconds and no greater than
   21600 seconds.  The default value for MaxRtrAdvInterval is 10800
   seconds.


9.  IPv6 addressing for hosts

   The addressing scheme for IPv6 hosts in 802.16 network follows the
   IETFs recommendation for hosts specified in IPv6 Node Requirement,



Patil, et al.          Expires September 13, 2007              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        IPv6 over Packet CS in 802.16           March 2007


   RFC 4294.  The IPv6 node requirements RFC4294 [RFC4294] specifies a
   set of RFCs that are applicable for addressing and the same is
   applicable for hosts that use 802.16 as the link layer for
   transporting IPv6 packets.

9.1.  Interface Identifier

   The MS has a 48-bit globally unique MAC address as specified in
   802.16 [802.16].  This MAC address MUST be used to generate the
   modified EUI-64 format-based interface identifier as specified in the
   IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291].  The modified EUI-64
   interface identifier is used in stateless address autoconfiguration.
   As in other links that support IPv6, EUI-64 based interface
   identifiers are not mandatory and other mechanisms, such as random
   interface identifiers, Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration in IPv6 [RFC3041] MAY also be used.

9.2.  Duplicate address detection

   DAD SHOULD be performed as per Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6,
   [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis] and, IPv6 Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration, [I-D.ietf-ipv6-rfc2462bis].  The IPv6 link over
   802.16 is specified in this document as a point-to-point link.  Based
   on this criteria, it may be redundant to perform DAD on a global
   unicast address that is configured using the EUI-64 or generated as
   per RFC3041 [RFC3041] for the interface as part of the IPv6 stateless
   address autoconfiguration protocol [I-D.ietf-ipv6-rfc2462bis] as long
   as the following two conditions are met:

   1.  The prefixes advertised through the router advertisement messages
       by the access router terminating the 802.16 IPv6 link are unique
       to that link.
   2.  The access router terminating the 802.16 IPv6 link does not
       autoconfigure any IPv6 global unicast addresses from the prefix
       that it advertises.

9.3.  Stateless address autoconfiguration

   Stateless address autoconfiguration SHOULD be performed as specified
   in [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis], [I-D.ietf-ipv6-rfc2462bis] .

9.4.  Stateful address autoconfiguration

   Stateful address autoconfiguration SHOULD be performed as specified
   in [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis], [RFC3315].

10.  Multicast Listener Discovery

   Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6
   [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis] SHOULD be supported as specified by the hosts
   and routers attached to each other via an 802.16 link.  The access
   router which has hosts attached to it via a Point-to-point link over
   an 802.16 SHOULD not send periodic queries if the host is in idle/
   dormant mode.  The AR can obtain information about the state of a
   host from the paging controller in the network.


11.  IANA Considerations

   This draft does not require any actions from IANA.


12.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new vulnerabilities to IPv6
   specifications or operation.  The security of the 802.16 air
   interface is the subject of [802.16].  In addition, the security
   issues of the network architecture spanning beyond the 802.16 base
   stations is the subject of the documents defining such architectures,
   such as WiMAX Network Architecture [WiMAXArch].

Appendix A.  WiMAX network architecture and IPv6 support

   The WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) forum
   [WMF] has defined a network architecture in which the air interface
   is based on the IEEE 802.16 standard.  The addressing and operation
   of IPv6 described in this document is applicable to the WiMAX network
   as well.

   The WiMAX network architecture consists of the Access Service Network
   (ASN) and the Connectivity Service Network (CSN).  The ASN is the
   access network which includes the BS and the AR in addition to other
   functions such as AAA, Mobile IP Foreign agent, Paging controller,
   Location Register etc.  The ASN is defined as a complete set of
   network functions needed to provide radio access to a WiMAX
   subscriber.  The ASN is the access network to which the MS attaches.
   The IPv6 access router is an entity within the ASN.  The term ASN is
   specific to the WiMAX network architecture.  The CSN is the entity
   that provides connectivity to the Internet and includes functions
   such as Mobile IP Home agent and AAA.  The figure below shows the
   WiMAX reference model:

                  Figure 7: WiMAX Network reference model

   Three different types of ASN realizations called profiles are defined
   by the architecture.  ASNs of profile types A and C include BS' and
   ASN-gateway(s) (ASN-GW) which are connected to each other via an R6
   interface.  An ASN of profile type B is one in which the
   functionality of the BS and other ASN functions are merged together.
   No ASN-GW is specifically defined in a profile B ASN.  The absence of
   the R6 interface is also a profile B specific characteristic.  The MS
   at the IPv6 layer is associated with the AR in the ASN.  The AR may
   be a function of the ASN-GW in the case of profiles A and C and is a
   function in the ASN in the case of profile B. When the BS and the AR
   are separate entities and linked via the R6 interface, IPv6 packets
   between the BS and the AR are carried over a GRE tunnel.  The
   granularity of the GRE tunnel should be on a per MS basis or on a per
   service flow basis (an MS can have multiple service flows, each of
   which are identified uniquely by a service flow ID).  The protocol
   stack in WiMAX for IPv6 is shown below:

                      Figure 8: WiMAX protocol stack

   As can be seen from the protocol stack description, the IPv6 end-
   points are constituted in the MS and the AR.  The BS provides lower
   layer connectivity for the IPv6 link.

Appendix B.  IPv6 link in WiMAX

   WiMAX is an example of a network based on the IEEE Std 802.16 air
   interface.  This section describes the IPv6 link in the context of a
   WiMAX network.  The MS and the AR are connected via a combination of
   :

   1.  The transport connection which is identified by a Connection
       Identifier (CID) over the air interface, i.e the MS and BS and,
   2.  A GRE tunnel between the BS and AR which transports the IPv6
       packets

   From an IPv6 perspective the MS and the AR are connected by a point-
   to-point link.  The combination of transport connection over the air
   interface and the GRE tunnel between the BS and AR creates a (point-
   to-point) tunnel at the layer below IPv6.

   The collection of service flows (tunnels) to an MS is defined as a
   single link.  Each link has only an MS and an AR.  Each MS belongs to
   a different link.  No two MSs belong to the same link.  A different
   prefix should be assigned to each unique link.  This link is fully
   consistent with a standard IP link, without exception and conforms
   with the definition of a point-to-point link in
   [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis].


Appendix C.  IPv6 link establishment in WiMAX

   The mobile station performs initial network entry as specified in
   802.16.  On succesful completion of the network entry procedure the
   ASN gateway/AR triggers the establishment of the initial service flow
   (ISF) for IPv6 towards the MS.  The ISF is a GRE tunnel between the
   ASN-GW/AR and the BS.  The BS in turn requests the MS to establish a
   transport connection over the air interface.  The end result is a
   transport connection over the air interface for carrying IPv6 packets
   and a GRE tunnel between the BS and AR for relaying the IPv6 packets.
   On succesful completion of the establishment of the ISF, IPv6 packets
   can be sent and received between the MS and AR.  The ISF enables the
   MS to communicate with the AR for host configuration procedures.
   After the establishment of the ISF, the AR can send a router
   advertisement to the MS.  An MS can establish multiple service flows
   with different QoS characteristics.  The ISF can be considered as the
   primary service flow.  The ASN-GW/ AR treats each ISF, along with the
   other service flows to the same MS, as a unique link which is managed
   as a (virtual) interface.

Appendix D.  Maximum transmission unit in WiMAX

   The WiMAX forum [WMF] has specified the Max SDU size as 1522 octets.
   Hence the IPv6 path MTU can be 1500 octets.  However because of the
   overhead of the GRE tunnel used to transport IPv6 packets between the
   BS and AR and the 6 byte MAC header over the air interface, using a
   value of 1500 would result in fragmentation of packets.  It is
   recommended that the default MTU for IPv6 be set to 1400 octets for
   the MS in WiMAX networks.  Note that the 1522 octet specification is
   a WiMAX forum specification and not the size of the SDU that can be
   transmitted over 802.16, which has a higher limit.
