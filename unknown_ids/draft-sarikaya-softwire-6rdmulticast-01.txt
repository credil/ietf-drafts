Abstract

   This memo specifies modifications required to 6rd so that both IPv6
   hosts can receive multicast data from IPv6 servers.  The protocol is
   based on proxying MLD at the 6rd Customer Edge and then tunneling MLD
   messages to 6rd Border Relays where IPv6 multicast routing is
   supported.  Multicast data received at 6rd Border Relay is tunneled
   to 6rd Customer Edge node and then delivered to the hosts.  We show
   that IPv4 multicast and IGMP can be supported in a similar way.

Internet-Draft          Multicast Support for 6rd              June 2011


1.  Introduction

   With IPv4 address depletion on the horizon, many techniques are being
   standardized for IPv6 migration including 6rd [RFC5969]. 6rd enables
   IPv6 hosts to communicate with external hosts using IPv4 only legacy
   ISP network. 6rd Customer Edge (CE) device's LAN side is dual stack
   and WAN side is IPv4 only.  CE tunnels IPv6 packets received from the
   LAN side to 6rd Border Relays (BR) after encapsulating IPv6 packet in
   an IPv4 packet.  BRs have anycast IPv4 addresses and receive
   encapsulated packets from CEs over a virtual interface. 6rd operation
   is stateless.  Packets are received/ sent independent of each other
   and no state needs to be maintained.

   6rd as defined in [RFC5969] and [RFC5569] is unicast only.  It does
   not support multicast.  In this document we specify how multicast
   from home IPv6 users can be supported in 6rd.  We also show how IPv4
   multicast can be supported for home IPv4 users.  Both solutions use
   IPv6 and IPv4 multicast addressing and do not require any new
   multicast address prefixes such as IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
   addresses to be allocated.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC5969], [RFC5569],
   [RFC3810] and [RFC3376].


3.  Requirements

   This section states requirements on 6rd multicast support protocol.

   6rd CE MUST support MLD Proxy as defined in [RFC4605]. 6rd CE MAY
   support IGMP Proxy.

   6rd BR MUST support MLD Querrier. 6rd CE MAY support IGMP Querrier.

   Both any source multicast (ASM) and source specific multicast (SSM)
   MUST be supported.


4.  Architecture

   In 6rd, there are hosts (possibly IPv4/ IPv6 dual stack) served by
   6rd Customer Edge device.  CE is dual stack facing the hosts and IPv4
   only facing the network or WAN side.  At the boundary of the network
   there is 6rd Border Relay.  BR receives IPv6 packets tunneled in IPv4
   from CE and decapsulates them and sends them out to IPv6 network.

   In order to support multicast CE implements MLD Proxy function
   [RFC4605].  IPv6 hosts send their join requests (MLD Membership
   Report messages) to CE.  CE as a proxy sends aggregated Report
   messages upstream towards BR.

             Figure 1: Architecture of 6rd Multicast Protocol

   BR is the default multicast querier for CE.  BR implements multicast
   router function or it could be another MLD proxy.

   All the elements of 6rd multicast support system are shown in
   Figure 1.


5.  6rd Multicast Operation

   In this section we specify how the host can subscribe and receive
   IPv6 multicast data from IPv6 content providers based on the
   architecture defined in Section 4.

   The hosts will send their subscription requests for IPv6 multicast
   groups upstream to the default router, i.e.  Costumer Edge device.
   After subscribing the group, the host can receive multicast data from
   the CE.  The host implements MLD protocol's host part.

   Customer Edge device is MLD Proxy.  After receiving the first MLD
   Report message requesting subscription to an IPv6 multicast group, CE
   establishes a tunnel interface with a Border Relay.  The tunnel is
   IPv4 based but it will carry IP traffic, MLD messages back and forth
   and IPv6 multicast data messages downstream.  This is similar to
   [RFC6224] but the operation is much simpler.  In 6rd environment
   there is no requirement to handle host mobility.  CE does not have to
   keep more than one tunnel interfaces, a single interface is

   sufficient.  MLD Proxy at the CE does not have to have more than one
   proxy instances, a single instance is sufficient.

   CE is regular MLD proxy and it keeps MLD proxy membership database.
   CE inserts multicast forwarding state on the incoming interface, and
   merges state updates into the MLD proxy membership database.  CE
   updates or remove elements from the database as required.  CE will
   then send an aggregated Report via the upstream tunnel to the BR when
   the membership database changes.

   CE answers MLD queries from BR based on the membership database.
   CE's downstream link follows the traditional multipoint channel
   forwarding and does not pose any specific problems.

   CE receives IPv6 multicast data from the BR tunneled over the tunnel
   interface.  CE decapsulates the packet and then forwards it
   downstream.  Each member host receives the data packet based on Layer
   2 multicast interface.  No packet duplication is necessary.

   Border Relay acts as the as the default multicast querier for all CEs
   that have established an IPv4 tunnel with it.  In order to keep a
   consistent multicast state between a CE and BR, once a CE is
   connected it will stay connected until the state becomes empty.
   After that point, the CE may establish another tunnel to a different
   BR.

   According to aggregated MLD reports received from a CE, BR
   establishes group/source-specific multicast forwarding states at its
   corresponding downstream tunnel interfaces.  After that, BR maintains
   or removes the state as required by the aggregated reports received
   from CE.

   At the upstream interface, BR procures for aggregated multicast
   membership maintenance.  Based on the multicast-transparent
   operations of the CEs, the BR treats its tunnel interfaces as
   multicast enabled downstream links, serving zero to many listening
   nodes.

   Multicast traffic arriving at the BR is transparently forwarded
   according to its multicast forwarding information base.  Multicast
   data is first replicated and then forwarded in IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel
   from BR to the corresponding CE.

5.1.  Tunnel Interface Considerations

   IPv6 in IPv4 tunneling is performed as specified in [RFC4213].
   Considerations specified in [RFC5969] apply.  Packets upstream from
   CE carry only MLD signaling messages and they are not expected to

   fragmentation.  However packets downstream, i.e. multicast data to CE
   may be subject to fragmentation.

5.2.  Supporting IPv4 Multicast in 6rd

   IPv4 multicast can be supported in a way similar to IPv6 as described
   in Section 5. 6rd Customer Edge device has IGMP Proxy function.
   Proxy operation for IGMP [RFC3376] is described in [RFC4605].

   CE receives IGMP join requests from the hosts and then sends
   aggregated IGMP Report messages upstream in an IPv4 in IPv4 tunnel.
   Tunnel addressing is in IPv4 and is as described in [RFC5969].
   Multicast membership database is maintained for all active IPv4
   multicast groups the hosts subscribe.

   6rd Border Relay is IGMP querier or another IGMP Proxy.  It serves
   all CEs downstream and treats its tunnel interfaces as multicast
   enabled downstream links, serving zero to many listening nodes.
   Multicast membership database is maintained based on the aggregated
   Reports received from downstream tunnel interfaces.

   IPv4 multicast data received from the multicast Single Source
   Multicast or Any Source Multicast sources are replicated according to
   the multicast membership database and the data packets are tunneled
   to the CEs that have one of more members of this multicast group.

   CEs receive multicast data upstream in the CE-BR tunnel and
   decapsulate it and then forward the packet downstream.  Each member
   host receive IPv4 multicast data packet from its Layer 2 interface.


6.  Solution Based on Layer 2 Multicast Support

   In this section we assume that Layer 2 multicast is supported in the
   network.  Layer 2 multicast support is done in order to forward
   multicast data downstream to the ports of Layer 2 devices, i.e.
   switches that requested a multicast group instead of flooding the
   data to all the ports.

   In the switches called snooping switches, multicast MAC address based
   filters are setup which link Layer 2 multicast groups to the egress
   ports.  When an MLD Report message is received, the bridge will setup
   a multicast filter entry that allows (in case of a join message) or
   prevents (in case of a leave message) packets to flow the port on
   which the MLD Report message was received.  In terms of IP multicast
   addresses, the mapping is not unique as 2 ** (112 - 32) IPv6
   multicast addresses map to a single Ethernet multicast MAC address.
   This would be reduced to 32 if allocation policy of using only the

   lower 32 bits in 112 bit group ID field of IPv6 multicast address is
   followed.

   Snooping switches maintain a list of multicast routers and the ports
   on which they are attached called router ports.  For this purpose
   multicast router discovery protocol described in [RFC4286] is used.
   The switch sends an ICMPv6 Multicast Router Solicitation message and
   the router sends ICMPv6 Multicast Router Advertisement message in
   reply.

   The main functionality of a snooping switch is to forward multicast
   data packets based on the filters that are setup, i.e. to those
   egress ports with multicast groups downstream and also to the router
   ports.

   In a 6rd network the snooping switches MUST detect MLD packets in the
   tunnel between CE and BR.  This requires IPv6 snooping switches to be
   capable of reading IPv4 protocol field values.  A value of 58
   indicates that an ICMPv6 packet is encapsulated.  A value of 41
   indicates that an IPv6 data packet is encapsulated.  The fact that
   MLD packets are ICMPv6 packets complicates the operation snooping
   switch.  The switch needs to look further into the packet to
   correctly identify an MLD packet.

   In case multicast is supported in Layer 2, BR after receiving a
   multicast data packet does not attempt to replicate the packet.  The
   packet replication is taken care of by the snooping switches.  So
   Layer 2 multicast support avoids packet duplication at BR which could
   be costly in some cases.
