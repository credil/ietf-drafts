1. Introduction 
    
   A network is, in general, controlled and managed taking into account 
   various attributes of the underlying technologies of the physical and 
   logical links and nodes. In a network operated using Generalized 
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols, many of these 
   Traffic Engineering (TE) attributes are advertised using routing 
   protocols [RFC3945], [RFC4202].  
    
        To establish a GMPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) it is necessary 
   to compute a route or path for that LSP either hop-by-hop or by the 
   pre-calculation of part or all of the path. In order that the route 
   selected is capable of satisfying the requirements of the user or 
   application that will use the LSP the computation must be constrained 
   by a set of LSP-specific requirements and the TE attributes 
   advertised within the network. Further, considerations of technology 
   and node or link capabilities may also provide restrictions to the 
   feasibility of LSP establishment on certain routes, and this can be 
   deduced from the TE attributes advertised within the network and used 
   by the path computation algorithms to select only viable routes. 
    
        In a mixed, integrated network (for example, one containing 
   optical switches and packet routers) these constraints may vary and 
   are understood differently for different equipment and different LSPs. 
   This document provides guidelines to facilitate path computation for 
   GMPLS LSPs by summarizing how GMPLS TE attributes on ingress links, 
   transit links, and egress links may be treated as path computation 
   constraints to determine the route of a GMPLS Label Switched Path 
   (LSP).  
    
2. Problem Statements 
    
   A GMPLS network which is composed of multiple nodes has each 
   capability in each node. Therefore, if each node in the network does 
   not have uniformed way for TE constraints in a path calculation, an 
   establishment for GMPLS LSPs may fail in the path computation or 
   signaling despite of sufficient resources existence. For the 
   capability of each TE-link, GMPLS has such a specification as ISCD 
   (Interface Switching Capability Descriptor) defined in [RFC4202]. On 
   the contrary, constraint conditions for end-to-end path calculation 
   for GMPLS LSPs are not clearly specified. To address the issue of an 
   LSP establishment, the selection of TE constraints for path 
   calculation must be clearly defined. 
    
   Figure 1 shows a typical network example composed of routers and PXCs 
   (photonic cross connects). To exactly match TE attributes of all 
   transit links to a desired LSP's one, a TE-link between two PXCs must 
   have multiple ISCDs of Ethernet and SONET/SDH encoding-types 
   following specification [RFC4202] to support LSPs with both encoding-
   types. However, it is not efficient because PXC itself does not have

   such a capability and simply switch lambda only. To correctly 
   establish the LSP in such a network, the constraint consideration for 
   end-to-end path calculation must be clearly defined.

3. Assumed Network Model 
    
   3.1 GMPLS TE Attributes Consideration for Path Calculation 
    
   For path computation to establish GMPLS LSPs correctly, various GMPLS 
   attributes [RFC4202], [RFC4203] of links as well as nodes, as 
   indicated below, must be taken into account in a GMPLS network 
   environment in addition to TE attributes of packet based network 
   [RFC3630]. 
    
        (1) Encoding-type: Synchronous Optical Network 
        (SONET)/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Lambda, Ethernet, 
        etc. 
        (2) Switching capability: Time Division Multiplex (TDM), Lambda, 
        Fiber, etc. 
        (3) Bandwidth: OC-192, OC-48, GbE, 10GbE, etc. 
    
   These logical attributes have a very tight relationship with 
   underlying physical technologies such as SONET/SDH, Optical Transport 
   Network (OTN) or Ethernet in terms of links, and all-optical switches, 
   SONET/SDH-basis digital cross connect or electrical-basis optical 
   switches in terms of nodes.  Therefore, the GMPLS LSPs must satisfy 
   logical constrains as well as corresponding physical constraints. 
   These constraints are sometimes differently understood among 
   different layers, and a logically computed GMPLS LSP may violate the 
   physical constraints, therefore, a consistent guideline to solve this 
   issue should be formulated.

   3.2 Considered Network Model 
    
   Figure 2 depicts a typical GMPLS network, consisting of an ingress 
   link, a transit link as well as an egress link, to investigate a 
   consistent guideline for GMPLS path computation. Each link at each 
   interface has its own switching capability, encoding type and 
   bandwidth. 
   The consideration here is based on a single domain GMPLS network, but 
   the analysis maybe applicable to an inter-domain GMPLS networks. 
    
             Ingress             Transit             Egress             
   +-----+   link1-2   +-----+   link2-3   +-----+   link3-4   +-----+  
   |Node1|------------>|Node2|------------>|Node3|------------>|Node4|  
   |     |<------------|     |<------------|     |<------------|     |  
   +-----+   link2-1   +-----+   link3-2   +-----+   link4-3   +-----+  
 
                       Figure 2: GMPLS Network Model 
    
    
   For the simplicity of the analysis in path consideration, the below 
   basic assumptions are made when the LSP is created. 
    
       (1) Switching capabilities (SC) of outgoing links from the 
           ingress and egress nodes (link1-2 and link4-3 in Figure 1)  
           must be consistent with each other. 
       (2) SC of all transit links including incoming links to the 
           ingress and egress nodes (link2-1 and link3-4) should be 
           consistent with switching type of a LSP to be created. 
       (3) Encoding-types of all transit links should be consistent 
           with encoding type of a LSP to be created. 
        
  A GMPLS network maybe a multi-layer network, which is composed of 
  multiple nodes with different switching capabilities and interface 
  encoding types. Therefore, a hierarchical structure may be considered 
  in path computation. In such a case, the combination between the 
  switching type and encoding type of a desired LSP, and those of all 
  transit links described as the table in following section may be 
  acceptable. One of advertised multiple interface switching capability 
  descriptors for the same link [RFC4202] should be also appropriately 
  chosen as the attribute for the link. 
        
   Bandwidth of each TE link is maximum LSP bandwidth in interface 
   switching capability descriptor at the priority for a desired LSP 
   [RFC4203], and encoding-types of incoming and outgoing links on the 
   same interface (for example, link1-2 and link2-1) should be 
   consistent with each other. 
    
   In case that the network is comprised of numbered links and 
   unnumbered links [RFC3477], an ingress node, who is able to support

   numbered links and unnumbered links may choose both links being part 
   of the same desired LSP. 
    
    
4. Path Computation Considerations 
 
        In this section, we consider GMPLS constraints to be satisfied 
   in different cases of link attributes. When a LSP indicated in below 
   tables is created, the path computation must choose the route so as 
   to satisfy switching capability, encoding type and bandwidth at the 
   ingress link, transiting links and the egress link indicated in 
   columns next to the created LSP, considering underlying physical 
   constraints. Here, almost cases of GMPLS path computation 
   consideration are summarized in this document, however, some cases 
   will be added in a future version.

   *OTN interfaces are equivalent to digital wrapper technology in this 
   document. 
   * BW is the desired bandwidth of the LSP 
   * bw is the bandwidth available on the link 
 
   In this case, since the interface with TDM SC supports sub-rate 
   switching, BW X can be equal to or less than bw of ingress, transit 
   and egress links, and must be larger than the minimum LSP bandwidth 
   in the interface switching capability descriptor. Sub-rate switching

   is unsuited for a hierarchical LSP, because the lower-layer link 
   usually has larger granular bandwidth than that layer except PSC-x, 
   for example a TDM LSP with the desired bandwidth of OC-12 should not 
   use a lambda switching capable link with the bandwidth of OC-48 as a 
   transit link. In such a case, a lambda LSP as a forwarding adjacency 
   (FA) LSP is created on the lower (lambda) layer in advance, then the 
   FA-LSP [LSP-HIER] may be advertised as a TDM SC link.

   If an interface supports only a specific bit-rate and format such as 
   SONET/SDH or Ethernet encoding, BW X must be equal to bw so as to 
   match bit-rate and its framing. 
    
   *In the case of an interface with a lambda encoding and a transparent 
   to bit-rate and framing, BW X must be equal to or less than bw.

   Although the interface with FSC can switch the entire contents to 
   another interface, this interface should only be used for optical 
   wavelength or waveband switching.

   Since the interface with PSC supports only packet-by-packet switching, 
   BW X must be equal to or less than bw, and must be larger than the 
   minimum LSP bandwidth. 
    
   These GMPLS constraints must be considered for computing paths and 
   creating GMPLS LSPs. 
    
   This document does not discuss domain based multilayer path 
   computation considerations where specific routing policies, which are 
   sometimes independent from the underlying domains and sometimes take 
   the underlying domains' policies into consideration, are required. 
 
   
5. Security consideration 
    
        Anything that can be done to change the output of a path 
   computation algorithm can significantly affect the operational 
   stability of a network, could force traffic to traverse undesirable 
   or costly links, and could place data into less secure parts of the 
   network. Therefore, the integrity of the path computation mechanism 
   is very significant in a GMPLS network. 
    
        The path computation algorithm, itself, and the mechanisms for 
   conveying computed paths to and between the LSRs in the network are 
   out of scope for this document. But misuse or confusion with respect 
   of the handling of the attributes described in this document could 
   leave a network open to various security attacks. In particular, if 
   there is a known mismatch between the interpretation or handling of 
   TE attributes within a network this might be exploited by an attacker 
   to cause disruption or to waste network resources in an integrated

   multi-technology network. Therefore, network operators are 
   Recommended to use a consistent approach across the whole network.
