	This document specifies the SIP P-Private-Network-Indication
	P-header. The use of this private network indication extension
	is only applicable inside an administrative domain with
	previously agreed-upon policies for generation, transport and
	usage of such information.  A private network indication
	allows nodes in such a domain to treat private network traffic
	according to a different set of rules than the set
	applicable to public network traffic. The indication also
	distinguishes traffic from one private network from another
	private network.

	<t>
	  ETSI TISPAN defines Next Generation Networks (NGN) which
	  uses the 3rd-Generqation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS (IP
	  Multimedia Subsystem) which in turn uses SIP (RFC3261
	  <xref target="RFC3261"/>) as its main signalling
	  protocol. (For more information on the IMS, a detailed
	  description can be found in 3GPP TS 23.228
	  <xref target="3GPP.23.228"/> and 3GPP TS 24.229
	  <xref target="3GPP.24.229"/>.) 3GPP and ETSI TISPAN have
	  identified a set of requirements that can be met by defining
	  a new SIP P-header, according to the procedures in RFC 3427
	  <xref target="RFC3427"/>.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Applicability"
	       anchor="sec-applicability">
	<t>According to RFC 3427 <xref target="RFC3427"/>, P-headers
	  have a limited applicability. Specifications of P-headers
	  such as this RFC need to clearly document the useful scope
	  of the proposal, and explain its limitations and why it is
	  not suitable for the general use of SIP on the Internet.
	</t>
	<t>The P-Private-Network-Indication header field is intended
	to be used in controlled closed networks like 3GPP IMS and
	ETSI TISPAN NGN networks. The P-Private-Network-Indication
	header field does not seem useful in a general internet
	environment.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Business communication" anchor="sec-intro-buscom">
	<t>
	  In the context of its work on business communiction support in
    public next generation networks, ETSI TISPAN has identified
    a framework <xref target="ETSI.181.019"/> for the support of
    business communication capabilities by the NGN. As well as the
    direct attachment of Next Generation Corporate Network (NGCN)
    equipment, this includes the capability to "host" functionality
    relating to an enterprise within the NGN itself.
	</t>
	<t>
    These hosting arrangements are:
    <list style="format %c)">
      <t>virtual leased line, where NGCN sites are interconnected
      through the NGN;</t>
      <t>business trunking application, where the NGN hosts transit
      capabilities between NGCN's, break-in capabilities where the NGN
      converts public network traffic to private network traffic for
      delivery at a served NGCN and break-out capabilities where the
      NGN converts private network traffic from a served NGCN to
      public network traffic; and</t>
      <t>hosted enterprise services, where an NGN hosts originating
      and/or terminating business communication capabilities for
      business communication users that are directly attached to an
      NGN.</t>
    </list>
    </t>
    <t>
    ETSI TISPAN has requirements that can be met by the introduction
    of an explicit indication for private network traffic.
    </t>
    <t>The traffic generated or received by a public NGN on behalf of
    a private network can be either:
    <list style="symbols">
    <t>
    public network traffic: traffic sent to or received from an NGN
    for processing according to the rules for ordinary subscribers of
    a public telecommunication network. This type of traffic is known
    as public network traffic;
    </t>
    <t>
    private network traffic: traffic sent to the NGN for processing
    according to an agreed set of rules specific to an
    enterprise. This type of traffic is known as private network
    traffic. Private network traffic is normally within a single
    enterprise, but private network traffic can also exist between two
    different enterprises if not precluded for regulatory reasons.
    </t>
    </list>
    </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Indication types" anchor="sec-intro-indtypes">
  <t>A private network indication as proposed by this document is an
  indication to each and every network element traversed that this is
  private network traffic as opposed to public network traffic. This
  indication does not identify an end user on a private network and is
  not for delivery to an end user on the private network.  It is an
  indication that special service arrangements apply for an
  enterprise, and therefore it is an indication of service on behalf
  of an enterprise, not an indication of service to a private network
  end user.
  </t>
  <t>
  In order to allow NGN IMS nodes to perform different processing ETSI
  TISPAN formulated the following requirements on NGN:
  <list style="numbers">
  <t>
  The NGN shall distinguish public network traffic from private
  network traffic.
  </t>
  <t>
  The NGN shall distinguish private network traffic belonging to one
  enterprise from that belonging to another enterprise.
  </t>
  </list>
  </t>
  <t>
  To summarize a few example reasons for a public NGN to make the
  distinction between the two types of traffic:
  <list style="symbols">
  <t>
  Different regulations apply to the two types of traffic, most
  notably lawful intercept requirements. Another example is emergency
  calls may be handled differently depending on the type of traffic.
  </t>
  <t>
  Different charging regimes may apply.
  </t>
  <t>
  Call recording for business reasons (e.g. quality control, training,
  non-repudiation) might apply only to a specific type of traffic.
  </t>
  <t>
  Different levels of signalling and/or media transparency may apply
  to the different types of traffic.
  </t>
  </list>
  </t>
  <t>There are several reasons why there is a need for an explicit
  indication in the signalling:
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>As calling and target addresses can not in all cases be used to
    determine whether a certain call is to be treated as private or
    public network traffic.</t>
    <t> Separate nodes in the network need to be able to act on the
    type of traffic being handled, when implicit schemes would be used
    it would require distribution of such enterprise specific logic
    over multiple nodes of multiple operators. That is clearly not a
    manageable architecture.</t>
    <t>There may be cases where treating the call as a public network
    call although both participants are from the same enterprise is
    advantageous to the enterprise.</t>
  </list>
  </t>
  <t>Given the above background this document will formulate
  requirements on SIP for support of an explicit private network
  indication.</t>

  <section title="Trust domain" anchor="sec-definitions-trust">
    <t>
      The term Trust Domain in this document is taken from RFC3324

      are specified in RFC3324 <xref target="RFC3324"/> which require
      the filling out a Spec (T).

    <t>
      The Spec (T) need not specify the same contents and trust domain
      boundaries that are used for other header fields like for
      example the P-Asserted-Identity.

   <t>Figure 1 shows the interconnection of sites belonging to two
   private networks using the public network. Traffic in the public
   network relating to the interconnection of the two sites of
   enterprise 1 are tagged as private network traffic relating to
   enterprise 1. In certain cases an enterprise can also choose to
   send traffic from one enterprise site to another enterprise site as
   public network traffic when this is beneficial to the
   enterprise. Traffic in the public network relating to the
   interconnection of the two sites of enterprise 2 are tagged as
   private network traffic relating to enterprise 2. Enterprise 1 also
   generates traffic to public phones and this is public network
   traffic (untagged in the public network).

  <t>
  This section lists the requirements on SIP derived from consideration in <xref

  <list style='format R%d:'>
    <t anchor="r1">It is REQUIRED that an indication can be send in
    SIP initial requests for a dialog or SIP standalone requests that
    indicates that the request or associated session is to be treated
    according to the rules of private network traffic.</t>
    <t>The indication from R1 can be inserted by a SIP proxy belonging
    to an administrative entity where for onward routeing, the traffic
    within that administrative entity needs to be so
    distinguished. The indication is not needed where the traffic is
    assumed to be all public, or where the traffic is assumed to be
    all private.</t>
    <t>The indication from R<xref target="r1" format="counter"/> can
    be removed by a SIP proxy belonging to an administrative entity
    where for onward routeing, the traffic no longer needs to be so
    distinguished. An example exists where the traffic reaches an NGCN
    site where the traffic is now assumed to all private network
    traffic. Another example is on the final hop to the UA.</t>
    <t>It is REQUIRED that the indication from R<xref target="r1"
    format="counter"/> allows entities to determine the set of rules
    that are applicable, these rules may be enterprise specific.</t>
    <t anchor="r3">It is REQUIRED that the indication from
    R<xref target="r1" format="counter"/> allows entities receiving it
    to distinguish private network traffic from different
    enterprises.</t>
    <t>The identifier to distinguish private network traffic belonging
    to one enterprise from that belonging to another enterprise must
    be globally unique. Business communication arrangements for any
    particular enterprise can be expected to span multiple NGN
    operators potentially in multiple countries.</t>
    <t>The indication from R<xref target="r1" format="counter"/>
    relates primarily to the SIP signaling. Applying the same concept
    to media may be possible, but is not necessarily meaningful where
    media is routed differently from signalling.</t>
  </list>
  </t>

</section>

<section title="Overview of solution" anchor="sec-">
  <t>The mechanism proposed in this document relies on a new header
  field called 'Private-Network-Indication' that contains an private
  network identifier expressed as a domain name, for example:
  </t>
  <t>
    <artwork><![CDATA[
P-Private-Network-Indication: ericsson.com
]]></artwork>
  </t>
  <t> A proxy server which handles a message can, based on
  authentication of the source of a message and configuration or local
  policy, insert such a Private-Network-Indication header field into
  the message and forward it to other trusted proxies to be handled as
  private network traffic.  A proxy that is about to forward a message
  to a proxy server or UA that it does not trust MUST remove the
  Private-Network-Indication header field.
  </t>
  <t> The private network identifier expressed as a domain name allows
  it to be globally unique identifier associated with the
  enterprise. Domain name is used as it allows reuse of a company
  owned internet domain name, without requiring an additional private
  network identifier registry. When the enterprise needs more then one
  identifier it can freely add subdomains that it has under its own
  control.
  </t>
  <t> The formal syntax for the Private-Network-Indication header is
  presented in <xref target="sec-pni-header"/>.

<section title="P-Private-Network-Indication header field definition"
anchor="sec-pni-header">
<t> This document defines the SIP P-Private-Network-Indication header
field.  This header field can be added by a proxy to initial requests
for a dialog or standalone requests. The presence of the
P-Private-Network-Indication header field signifies to proxies that
understand this header field that the request is to be treated as
private network traffic. The P-Private-Network-Indication header field
contains a domain name value that allows the private network traffic
to be associated with an enterprise to which it belongs and that allow
proxies that understand this header field to process the request according
to the request processing behaviours configured for a specific
enterprise.
</t>
<t> The augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) (RFC5234
<xref target="RFC5234"/>) syntax of the P-Private-Network-Indication
header field is the following:
</t>
<t>
<artwork>
P-Private-Network-Indication = 
                       "P-Private-Network-Indication" HCOLON PNI-value
                                                   *(SEMI PNI-param)
PNI-param                 = generic-param
PNI-value                 = hostname
</artwork>
</t>
<t> EQUAL, HCOLON, SEMI, hostname and generic-param are defined in RFC3261 <xref
target="RFC3261"/>.

<section title="Security considerations"
anchor="sec-security">
<t>
The private network indication being defined in this document is to be
used in an environment where elements are trusted and where attackers
are not supposed to have access to the protocol messages between those
elements. Traffic protection between network elements is sometimes
achieved by using IPsec and sometimes by physically protecting the
network. In any case, the environment where the private network
indication will be used ensures the integrity and the confidentiality
of the contents of this header field.
</t>
<t>
A private network indication received from an untrusted node MUST NOT be used and the information MUST be removed from a request or response before it is forwarded to entities in the trust domain. 
</t>
<t>
There is a security risk if a private network indication is allowed to
propagate out of the trust domain where it was generated. In that case
sensitive information would be revealed by such a breach. To prevent
such a breach from happening: Proxies MUST NOT insert the information
when forwarding requests to a next hop located outside the trust
domain. When forwarding the request to a trusted node, proxies MUST
NOT insert the header field unless they have sufficient knowledge that
the route set includes another proxy in the trust domain that
understands the header field, such as the own proxy. There is no automatic
mechanism to learn the support for this specification. Proxies MUST
remove the information when forwarding requests to untrusted nodes or
when the proxy does not have knowledge of any other proxy in the route
set that is able to understand the header field.

    <t>
    It would be technical possible, but extremely complex to perform this function without an explicit indication. For example, a logical distinction of proxies to handle private network traffic relating to enterprise 1, enterprise 2 and the public network traffic could be made by assigning different SIP URIs to these logical entities. This is not regarded as a viable solution.
    </t>

    <t>
    Several solutions have been raised and whether or not they are suitable and fulfill the requirements need to be discussed:
    <list style="symbols">
    <t>
    Attribute on existing header?
    </t>
    <t>
    Token on some existing header?
    </t>
    <t>
    Resource-Priority header?
    </t>
    <t>
    P-Asserted-Service header?
    </t>
    <t>
    Request-Disposition header?
    </t>
    <t>
    P-Access-Network-Information header?
    </t>
    <t>
    URI parameter?
    </t>
    <t>
    New P-header?
    </t>
    <t>
    New header?
    </t>
    </list>
    </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Attribute on existing header field" anchor="sec-sol-attr">
    <t>
    </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Token value on existing header field" anchor="sec-sol-token">
    <t>
    </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Resource-Priority header field" anchor="sec-sol-rph">
    <t>
    Some of the distinctive functions are already provided for in this header field. A potential mechanism would be to define a namespace for private network traffic. It would however be impossible to define a namespace for each enterprise, and therefore some additional parameter would need to be defined to carry the unique identifier of the particular enterprise to which the private network traffic relates. Successful usage may also require a tightening of the procedures for use of the Resource-Priority header field (much at the moment is left to the particular application of this header field).
    </t>
    <t>
    Private network traffic may, but is not necessarily handled with a different priority then public network traffic. Use of the Resource-Priority header field however seems to imply that the main focus of the indication is on prioritizing private network traffic. This may render use of the Resource-Priority header field as less appropriate for our particular purpose.
    </t>
    </section>

    <section title="P-Asserted-Service header field" anchor="sec-sol-pas">
    <t>
    The services envisaged by the P-Asserted-Service header field (draft-drage-sipping-service-identification <xref target="I-D.drage-sipping-service-identification"/>) are those applied to the end user. The end user in these cases is the end user of the enterprise or NGCN, not the enterprise itself. Therefore this header field is not considered suitable for this problem.
    </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Request-Disposition header field" anchor="sec-sol-rdh">
    <t>
    The Request-Disposition header field (RFC3841 <xref target="RFC3841"/>) specifies caller preferences for how a server should process a request. The caller in these cases is the end user of the enterprise or NGCN, not the enterprise itself. Therefore this header field is not considered suitable for this problem. Further RFC3841 explicitly states that the set of request disposition directives is not extensible.
    </t>
    </section>

    <section title="P-Access-Network-Information" anchor="sec-sol-pani">
    <t>
    The P-Access-Network-Info header field (RFC3455 <xref target="RFC3455"/>) contains information about the access network that a UA uses to get IP connectivity. However the access that one uses does not define the private network that a call that one sets up is to be part of.</t> 
    <t> Particular examples that illustrate this:
    <list style='symbols'>
      <t>A Hosted Enterprise Services user (i.e. Centrex) uses the access of the operator while still being able to setup calls that will turn out to be private network traffic.</t>
      <t>A corporate network UE that attaches to an operator network, but receives services from its home corporate network.</t>
    </list>
    </t>
    </section>

    <section title="URI parameter" anchor="sec-sol-urip">
    <t>
    A marking on the entities within the Via header field that are treating this as private network traffic. Potential marking on the route header field of entities that are expected to treat it as private network traffic.
    </t>
    </section>

    <section title="New header field" anchor="sec-sol-nh">

      <section title="General" anchor="sec-sol-nh-gen">
      <t>
      If none of the existing header fields is appropriate a logical
      step is to define a new header field for the private network
      indication.
      </t>
     </section>

      <section title="Full SIP header field" anchor="sec-sol-nh-f">
      <t>
      A full SIP header field is appropriate when the usage of this
      information element is more general then closed networks like
      ETSI TISPAN NGN or 3GPP IMS.
      </t>
      </section>

      <section title="New P-header field" anchor="sec-sol-nh-p">
      <t>
      In case no general usage is foreseen other then usage in closed
      networks like those specified by ETSI TISPAN NGN or 3GPP IMS a
      P-header field seems the appropriate choice.
