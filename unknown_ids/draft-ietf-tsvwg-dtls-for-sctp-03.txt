1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) protocol, as defined in [RFC4347], over the Stream
   Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as defined in [RFC4960].

   Security features provided by DTLS over SCTP include authentication,
   message integrity and privacy of user messages.  Applications using
   DTLS over SCTP can use almost all transport features provided by SCTP
   and its extensions.

   TLS, from which DTLS was derived, is designed to run on top of a
   byte-stream oriented transport protocol providing a reliable, in-
   sequence delivery.  Thus, TLS is currently mainly being used on top
   of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), as defined in [RFC0793].

   TLS over SCTP as described in [RFC3436] has some serious limitations:

   o  It does not support the unordered delivery of SCTP user messages.

   o  It does not support partial reliability as defined in [RFC3758].

   o  It only supports the usage of the same number of streams in both
      directions.

   o  It uses a TLS connection for every bidirectional stream, which
      requires a substantial amount of resources and message exchanges
      if a large number of streams is used.

   DTLS over SCTP as described in this document overcomes these
   limitations of TLS over SCTP.  Especially DTLS/SCTP supports

   o  preservation of message boundaries.

   o  a large number of uni-directional and bi-directional streams.

   o  ordered and unordered delivery of SCTP user messages.

   o  the partial reliability extension as defined in [RFC3758].

   o  the dynamic address reconfiguration extension as defined in
      [RFC5061].

   However, the following limitations still apply:

Internet-Draft                DTLS for SCTP                February 2010


   o  The maximum user message size is 2^14 bytes, which is the DTLS
      limit.

   o  The DTLS user can not perform the SCTP-AUTH key management,
      because this is done by the DTLS layer.

   The method described in this document requires that the SCTP
   implementation supports the optional feature of fragmentation of SCTP
   user messages as defined in [RFC4960] and the SCTP authentication
   extension defined in [RFC4895].

1.2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

   Association:  An SCTP association.

   Stream:  A unidirectional stream of an SCTP association.  It is
      uniquely identified by a stream identifier.

1.3.  Abbreviations

   DTLS:  Datagram Transport Layer Security.

   MTU:  Maximum Transmission Unit.

   PPID:  Payload Protocol Identifier.

   SCTP:  Stream Control Transmission Protocol.

   TCP:  Transmission Control Protocol.

   TLS:  Transport Layer Security.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  DTLS Considerations

3.1.  Message Sizes

   DTLS limits the DTLS user message size to the current Path MTU minus
   the header sizes.  This limit SHOULD be increased to 2^14 Bytes for

   DTLS over SCTP.

3.2.  Replay Detection

   Replay detection of DTLS MUST NOT be used.

3.3.  Path MTU Discovery

   Path MTU discovery of DTLS MUST NOT be used.

3.4.  Retransmission of Messages

   DTLS procedures for retransmissions MUST NOT be used.

3.5.  Future Versions of DTLS

   This document is based on [RFC4347].  If a new RFC updates or
   obsoletes [RFC4347], this documents also applies to the newer
   document defining DTLS unless this document also gets updated or
   revised.


4.  SCTP Considerations

4.1.  Mapping of DTLS Records

   The supported maximum length of SCTP user messages MUST be at least
   2^14 + 2048 + 13 = 18445 bytes (2^14 + 2048 is the maximum length of
   the DTLSCiphertext.fragment and 13 is the size of the DTLS record
   header).  In particular, the SCTP implementation MUST support
   fragmentation of user messages.

   Every SCTP user message MUST consist of exactly one DTLS record.

4.2.  DTLS connection handling

   Each DTLS connection MUST be established and terminated within the
   same SCTP association.  A DTLS connection MUST NOT span multiple SCTP
   associations.

4.3.  Payload Protocol Identifier Usage

   Application protocols running over DTLS over SCTP SHOULD register and
   use a separate payload protocol identifier (PPID) and SHOULD NOT
   reuse the PPID which they registered for running directly over SCTP.

   This means in particular that there is no specific PPID for DTLS.

Internet-Draft                DTLS for SCTP                February 2010


4.4.  Stream Usage

   All DTLS messages of the ChangeCipherSpec, Alert, or Handshake
   protocol MUST be transported on stream 0 with unlimited reliability
   and with the ordered delivery feature.

   All DTLS messages of the ApplicationData protocol MAY be transported
   over stream 0, but users SHOULD use other streams to avoid possible
   performance problems due to head of line blocking.

4.5.  Chunk Handling

   DATA chunks of SCTP MUST be sent in an authenticated way as described
   in [RFC4895].  Other chunks MAY be sent in an authenticated way.
   This makes sure that an attacker can not modify the stream in which a
   message is sent in or affect the ordered/unordered delivery of the
   message.

   If PR-SCTP as defined in [RFC3758] is used, FORWARD-TSN chunks MUST
   also be sent in an authenticated way as described in [RFC4895].  This
   makes sure that it is not possible for an attacker to drop messages
   and use forged FORWARD-TSN, SACK, and/or SHUTDOWN chunks to hide this
   dropping.

4.6.  Handshake

   A DTLS implementation discards DTLS messages from older epochs after
   some time as described in section 4.1 of [RFC4347].  This is not
   acceptable when the DTLS user performs a reliable data transfer.  To
   avoid discarding messages, the following procedures are required.

   Before sending a ChangeCipherSpec message all outstanding SCTP user
   messages MUST have been acknowledged by the SCTP peer and MUST NOT be
   revoked anymore by the SCTP peer.

   Prior to processing a received ChangeCipherSpec all other received
   SCTP user messages which are buffered in the SCTP layer MUST be read
   and processed by DTLS.

   User messages arriving between ChangeCipherSpec and Finished using
   the new epoch have probably passed the Finished and MUST be buffered
   by DTLS until the Finished is read.

4.7.  Handling of Endpoint-pair Shared Secrets

   The endpoint-pair shared secret for Shared Key Identifier 0 is empty.
   Whenever the master key changes, a 64 byte shared secret is derived
   from every master secret and provided as a new end-point pair shared

   secret by using the algorithm described in [I-D.ietf-tls-extractor].
   The new Shared Key Identifier MUST be the old Shared Key Identifier
   incremented by 1.  If the old one is 65535, the new one MUST be 1.

   Before sending the Finished message the active SCTP-AUTH key MUST be
   switched to the new one.

   Once the corresponding Finished message from the peer has been
   received the old SCTP-AUTH key SHOULD be removed.

4.8.  Shutdown

   To prevent DTLS from discarding DTLS user messages while it is
   shutting down, a CloseNotify message MUST only be sent after all
   outstanding SCTP user messages have been acknowledged by the SCTP
   peer and MUST NOT still be revoked by the SCTP peer.

   Prior to processing a received CloseNotify all other received SCTP
   user messages which are buffered in the SCTP layer MUST be read and
   processed by DTLS.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to add a value to the TLS Exporter Label registry as
   described in [I-D.ietf-tls-extractor].  The label suggested is
   EXTRACTOR_DTLS_OVER_SCTP.  The reference should refer to this
   document.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations given in [RFC4347], [RFC4895], and
   [RFC4960] also apply to this document.

   It is possible to authenticate DTLS endpoints based on IP-addresses
   in certificates.  SCTP associations can use multiple addresses per
   SCTP endpoint.  Therefore it is possible that DTLS records will be
   sent from a different IP-address than that originally authenticated.
   This is not a problem provided that no security decisions are made
   based on that IP-address.  This is a special case of a general rule:
   all decisions should be based on the peer's authenticated identity,
   not on its transport layer identity.

   For each message the SCTP user also provides a stream identifier, a
   flag to indicate whether the message is sent ordered or unordered and
   a payload protocol identifier.  Although DTLS can be used to provide
   privacy for the actual user message, none of these three are

   protected by DTLS.  They are sent as clear text, because they are
   part of the SCTP DATA chunk header.
