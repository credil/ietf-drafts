Internet-Draft   Post-Repair Loss RLE Report Block Type     October 2008


1.  Introduction

   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is the out-of-band control protocol for
   the applications that are using the Real-time Transport Protocol
   (RTP) for media delivery and communications [RFC3550].  RTCP allows
   the RTP entities to monitor the data delivery and provides them
   minimal control functionality via sender and receiver reports as well
   as other control packets.  [RFC3611] expands the RTCP functionality
   further by introducing the RTCP Extended Reports (XR).

   One of the initial XR report block types defined in [RFC3611] is the
   Loss Run Length Encoding (RLE) Report Block.  This report conveys the
   information regarding the individual RTP packet receipt and loss
   events experienced during the RTCP interval preceding the
   transmission of the report.  However, the Loss RLE in an RTCP XR
   report is usually collected only on the primary source stream before
   any loss-repair method is applied.  Once one or more loss-repair
   methods, e.g., Forward Error Correction (FEC) [RFC5109] and/or
   retransmission [RFC4588], are applied, some or all of the lost
   packets on the primary source stream may be recovered.  However, the
   pre-repair Loss RLE cannot indicate which source packets were
   recovered and which are still missing.  Thus, the pre-repair Loss RLE
   cannot specify how well the loss repair performed.

   This issue can be addressed by generating an additional report block
   (within the same RTCP XR report), which reflects the packet receipt/
   loss events after all loss-repair methods are applied.  This report
   block, which we refer to as the Post-repair Loss RLE, indicates the
   remaining missing, i.e., unrepairable, source packets.  When the pre-
   repair and post-repair Loss RLEs are compared, the RTP sender or
   another third party entity can evaluate the effectiveness of the
   loss-repair methods (at the packet level) in an aggregated fashion.
   To avoid any ambiguity in the evaluation, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   post-repair Loss RLE is generated for the source packets that have no
   further chance of being repaired.  If the loss-repair method(s) may
   still recover one or more missing source packets, the post-repair
   Loss RLE SHOULD NOT be sent until the loss-recovery process has been
   completed.

   Note that the idea of using pre-repair and post-repair Loss RLEs can
   be further extended when multiple sequential loss-repair methods are
   applied to the primary source stream.  Reporting the Loss RLEs before
   and after each loss-repair method can provide specific information
   about the individual performances of these methods.  However, it can
   be a difficult task to quantify the specific contribution made by
   each loss-repair method in hybrid systems, where different methods
   collectively work together to repair the lost source packets.  Thus,
   in this specification we only consider reporting the Loss RLE after

Internet-Draft   Post-Repair Loss RLE Report Block Type     October 2008


   all loss-repair methods are applied.

   This document registers a new report block type to cover the post-
   repair Loss RLE within the framework of RTCP XR.  Applications that
   are employing one or more loss-repair methods MAY use Post-repair
   Loss RLE Reports for every packet they receive or for a set of
   specific packets they have received.  In other words, the coverage of
   the post-repair Loss RLEs may or may not be contiguous.


2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Post-Repair Loss RLE Report Block

   The Post-repair Loss RLE Report Block is similar to the existing Loss
   RLE Report Block defined in [RFC3611].  The report format is shown in
   Figure 1.  Using the same structure for reporting both pre-repair and
   post-repair Loss RLEs allows the implementations to compare the Loss
   RLEs very efficiently.

   o  block type (BT):  8 bits
      A Post-repair Loss RLE Report Block is identified by the constant
      10.

   o  rsvd.:  4 bits
      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   o  thinning (T):  4 bits
      The amount of thinning performed on the sequence number space.
      Only those packets with sequence numbers 0 mod 2^T are reported on
      by this block.  A value of 0 indicates that there is no thinning,
      and all packets are reported on.  The maximum thinning is one
      packet in every 32,768 (amounting to two packets within each 16-
      bit sequence space).

   o  block length:  16 bits
      The length of this report block, including the header, in 32-bit
      words minus one.

   o  SSRC of source:  32 bits

      The SSRC of the RTP data packet source being reported upon by this
      report block.

   o  begin_seq:  16 bits

      The first sequence number that this block reports on.

   o  end_seq:  16 bits

      The last sequence number that this block reports on plus one.

   o  chunk i:  16 bits
      There are three chunk types:  run length, bit vector, and
      terminating null, defined in [RFC3611] (Section 4).  If the chunk
      is all zeroes, then it is a terminating null chunk.  Otherwise,
      the left most bit of the chunk determines its type:  0 for run
      length and 1 for bit vector.

   Note that the sequence numbers that are included in the report refer
   to the primary source stream.


4.  Session Description Protocol Signaling

   A new parameter is defined for the Post-repair Loss RLE Report Block
   to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].  It has
   the following syntax within the "rtcp-xr" attribute:

   full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC3611] apply in this document as
   well.


6.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

   This document assigns the block type value 10 in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry to "Post-repair Loss RLE Report Block."  This document
   also registers the SDP [RFC4566] parameter "post-repair-loss-rle" for
   the "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry.
