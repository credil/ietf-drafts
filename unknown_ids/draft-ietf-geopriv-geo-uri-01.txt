Abstract

   This document specifies an Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for
   geographic locations using the 'geo' scheme name.  A 'geo' URI
   identifies a physical location in a two- or three-dimensional
   coordinate reference system in a compact, simple, human-readable, and
   protocol independent way.  The default coordinate reference system
   used is WGS-84.

2.  Introduction

   An increasing number of Internet protocols and data formats are
   extended by specifications for adding spatial (geographic) location.
   In most cases, latitude as well as longitude of simple points are
   added as new attributes to existing data structures.  However, all
   those methods are very specific to a certain data format or protocol,
   and don't provide a protocol independent, compact and generic way to
   refer to a physical geographic location.

Internet-Draft              'geo' URI scheme                   July 2009


   Over the past few years, fast emerging location aware applications
   and location based services were observable on the Internet.  Most
   web search engines use geographic information, and a vivid open
   source mapping community brought an enormous momentum into location
   aware technology.  A wide range and former to professionals exclusive
   tools and data were provided free of charge for an everyday use on
   the mass market.

   The 'geo' URI scheme is another step into that direction and aims to
   facilitate, support and standardize the problem of location
   identification in geospatial services and applications.  Accessing
   information about or trigger further services based on a particular
   place on earth shouldn't be any harder for users than clicking on a
   'mailto:' link and write an email straight away.

   According to [RFC3986], a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is "a
   compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or
   physical resource".  The 'geo' URI scheme defined in this document
   identifies geographic locations (a physical resource) in a coordinate
   references system (CRS), per default in World Geodetic System 1984
   (WGS-84) [WGS84].  The optional "crs" URI parameter described below
   may be used by future specifications to define the use of other
   CRSes.  However, such definitions are out of scope of this document.

   'Geo' URIs identify a geographic location using a textual
   representation of the location's spatial coordinates in either two or
   three dimensions (latitude, longitude, and optionally altitude for
   the default CRS of WGS-84).  Such URIs are independent from a
   specific protocol, application, or data format, and can be used in
   any other protocol or data format that supports inclusion of
   arbitrary URIs.

   For the sake of usability, the definition of the URI scheme is
   strictly focused on the simplest, but also most common representation
   of a spatial location - a single point.  The provision of more
   complex geometries or locations described by civic addresses is out
   of scope of this document.

   Note: The choice of WGS-84 as the default CRS is based on the
   widespread availability of Global Positioning System (GPS) devices,
   which use the WGS-84 reference system.  It is anticipated that such
   devices serve as one of the primary data sources for authoring 'geo'
   URIs, hence the adoption of the native GPS reference system for the
   URI scheme.  Also, many other data formats for representing
   geographic locations use the WGS-84 reference system, which makes
   transposing from and to such data formats less error prone (no re-
   projection involved).

3.  Terminology

   Geographic locations in this document are defined using WGS 84 (World
   Geodetic System 1984), equivalent to the International Association of
   Oil & Gas Producers (OGP) Surveying and Positioning Committee EPSG
   (European Petroleum Survey Group) code 4326 (2 dimensions) and 4979
   (3 dimensions).  This document does not assign responsibilities for
   coordinate transformations from and to other Spatial Reference
   Systems.

   A 2-dimensional WGS-84 coordinate value is here represented as a
   comma-delimited latitude/longitude pair, measured in decimal degrees
   (un-projected).  A 3-dimensional WGS-84 coordinate value is here
   represented by appending a comma-delimited altitude value in meters
   to such pairs.

   Latitudes range from -90 to 90 and longitudes range from -180 to 180.
   Coordinates in the Southern and Western hemispheres as well as
   altitudes below the WGS-84 reference geoid are signed negative with a
   leading dash.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The optional "crs" parameter MUST NOT appear more than once.  If
   other parameters are also given, the "crs" parameter MUST be given
   first.  The definition of other parameters besides "crs" is out of
   scope for this document.

   Future documents proposing the use of other CRSes may update the
   definition of the 'crslabel' component.

   In case the URI identifies a location in the default CRS of WGS-84,
   its sub-components are further restricted as follows:

             coord-a        = latitude
             coord-b        = longitude
             coord-c        = altitude

             latitude       = [ "-" ] 1*2DIGIT [ "." 1*DIGIT ]
             longitude      = [ "-" ] 1*3DIGIT [ "." 1*DIGIT ]
             altitude       = [ "-" ] 1*DIGIT [ "." 1*DIGIT ]

4.4.  URI Scheme Semantics

   Data contained in a 'geo' URI identifies a physical resource: A
   spatial location on earth in the in a coordinate reference system,
   identified by the geographic coordinates encoded in the URI.

4.4.1.  Coordinate Reference System Identification

   The semantics of the 'coordinates' component depends on the CRS of
   the URI.  The CRS itself is identified by the optional 'crs'
   parameter the default.  A URI instance uses the default WGS-84 CRS if
   the 'crs' parameter is either missing, or contains the value of
   'wgs84'.  Other 'crs' values are not currently defined, but may be
   specified by future documents.

   Interpretation of coordinates in a wrong CRS produces invalid
   location information.  Consumers of 'geo' URIs therefore MUST NOT
   ignore the 'crs' parameter if given, and MUST NOT attempt to
   interpret the 'coordinates' component of given in an unknown CRS.

   The following component description refers to the use of the default
   CRS (WGS-84) only.  Future documents specifying other 'crs' parameter
   values MUST provide similar descriptions for the 'coordinates' sub-
   components in the described CRS.

4.4.2.  Component Description for WGS-84

   The "latitude", "longitude" and "altitude" components as specified in
   the URI scheme syntax ( Section 4.3) are to be used as follows:
   o  The "latitude" component MUST contain the latitude of the
      identified location in decimal degrees in the reference system
      WGS-84.
   o  The "longitude" component MUST contain the longitude of the
      identified location in decimal degrees in the reference system
      WGS-84.
   o  If present, the OPTIONAL "altitude" component MUST contain the
      WGS-84 altitude of the identified location in meters.

   If the altitude of the location is unknown, the "altitude" component
   MUST NOT be present in the URI.  Specifically, unknown altitude MUST
   NOT be represented by setting the 'altitude' component to "0" (or any
   other arbitrary value).

   The "longitude" components of coordinate values reflecting the poles
   (latitude set to -90 or 90 degrees) SHOULD be set to "0", although
   consumers of "geo" URIs MUST accept such URIs with any longitude
   value between -180 and 180.

Internet-Draft              'geo' URI scheme                   July 2009


   'geo' URIs with longitude values outside the range of -180 to 180
   decimal degrees or with latitude values outside the range of -90 to
   90 degrees MUST be considered invalid.

4.4.3.  URI Comparison

   Two 'geo' URIs are equal when they use the same CRS, and their
   'coord-a', 'coord-b' and 'coord-c' values are mathematically
   identical.

   Two 'geo' URIs use the same CRS if:
   o  their 'crslabel' components are identical
   o  or if neither URIs contain a 'crs' parameter (in which case both
      URIs use WGS-84)
   o  or if one URI contains a 'crslabel' value of 'wgs84', while the
      other URI does not contain a 'crs' parameter (which means that
      both URIs use the WGS-84 reference system as well, with one of the
      URIs specifying the CRS explicitely)

   For the default CRS of WGS-84, the following definitions apply
   additionally:
   o  Where the 'latitude' component of a 'geo' URI is set to either 90
      or -90 degrees, the 'longitude' component MUST be ignored in
      comparison operations.
   o  A 'longitude' component of 180 degrees MUST be considered equal a
      'longitude' component of -180 degrees for the purpose of URI
      comparison.

   An URI with undefined (missing) 'coord-c' (altitude) value MUST NOT
   be considered equal to an URI containing an 'coord-c' value, even if
   the remaining values 'coord-a' and 'coord-b' are equivalent.

4.4.4.  Interpretation of Undefined Altitude

   A consumer of a 'geo' URI in the WGS-84 CRS with undefined 'altitude'
   MAY assume that the URI refers to the respective location on earth's
   physical surface at the given 'latitude' and 'longitude' coordinate.

   However, as defined above, altitudes are relative to the WGS-84
   reference geoid rather than earth's surface.  Hence, an altitude
   value of 0 MUST NOT be interpreted as "on earth's surface".

4.5.  Encoding Considerations

   The 'coordinates' path component of the 'geo' URI (see Section 4.3)
   uses a comma (",") as a delimiter for subcomponents.  This delimiter
   MUST NOT be percent encoded.

Internet-Draft              'geo' URI scheme                   July 2009


   It is RECOMMENDED that for readability the contents of 'coord-a',
   'coord-b' and 'coord-c' subcomponents are never percent encoded.

4.6.  Applications/protocols That Use This URI Scheme

   As many other URI scheme definitions, the 'geo' URI provides resource
   identification independent of a specific application or protocol.
   Examples of potential protocol mappings and use cases can be found in
   Section 6.

4.7.  Interopability Considerations

   As with any other new URI scheme, the 'geo' URI requires support in
   client applications.  Users of applications which are not aware of
   the 'geo' scheme are likely unable to make direct use of the
   information in the URI.  However, the simple structure of the 'geo'
   URI would even allow manual dereference by users.

   Poorly authored 'geo' URI instances could contain whitespace and
   values with leading plus signs ("+"), which is not allowed according
   to the ABNF.  Clients SHOULD, however, try to dereference such URIs
   after removing such whitespace and plus signs.

   This specification does not define a query component.  Future
   revisions might define such components, using the "?" character to
   delimit query components from the path component specified above.
   Clients MUST be prepared to encounter such 'geo' URI instances, and
   MUST reduce the URI to the components specified in Section 4.3 before
   they dereference the URI.

   Clients MUST NOT attempt to dereference URIs given in an CRS that is
   unknown to the client, because doing so would produce entirely bogus
   results.

   Authors of 'geo' URIs should carefully check that coordinate
   components are set in the specified order, since wrong order of those
   components is a commonly observed mistake and produces completely
   bogus locations.

5.  URI Operations

   Currently, just one operation on a 'geo' URI is defined - location
   dereference: In that operation, a client dereferences the URI by
   extracting the geographical coordinates from the URI path component
   ('geo-path' in the ABNF).  Further use of those coordinates is then
   up to the application processing the URI, and might depend on the
   context of the URI.

   An application may then use this location information for various
   purposes, for example:

   o  A web browser could use that information to open a web mapping
      service of the user's choice, and display a map of the location

   o  A navigational device such as a Global Positioning System (GPS)
      receiver could offer the user to start navigation to the location.


6.  Use Cases and Examples

6.1.  Plain 'geo' URI Example

   The following 3-dimensional 'geo' URI example references to the
   office location of one of the authors in Vienna, Austria:

   geo:48.2010,16.3695,183

   A user could type the data extracted from this URI into a electronic
   navigation device, or even use it to locate the identified location
   on a paper map.

6.2.  Hyperlink

   'geo' URIs (like any other URI scheme) could also be embedded as
   hyperlinks in web pages.  A Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) snippet
   with such a hyperlink could look like:

Internet-Draft              'geo' URI scheme                   July 2009


   <p>one of Vienna's popular sights is the <a href='geo:
   48.198634,16.371648;crs=wgs84'>Karlskirche</a>.

   A web brower could extract the coordinates from the HTML snippet, and
   offer the user various options (based on configuration, context), for
   example:

   o  display a small map thumbnail when the mouse pointer hovers over
      the link

   o  switch to a mapping service of the user's choice once the link is
      selected

   o  Locate nearby resources, for example by comparing the 'geo' URI
      with locations extracted from GeoRSS feeds the user has subscribed
      to.

   o  Convert the coordinates to a format suitable for uploading to a
      navigation device

   Note that the URI in this example also makes use of the explicit
   specification of the CRS by using the 'crs' URI parameter.

6.3.  'geo' URI in 2-dimensional barcode

   Due to it's short length, a 'geo' URI could easily be encoded in
   2-dimensional barcodes.  Such barcodes could be printed on business
   cards, flyers, paper maps and subsequently used by mobile devices,
   for example as follows:

   1.  User identifies such a barcode on a flyer, uses the camera on his
       mobile phone to photograph and decode the barcode

   2.  The mobile phone dereferences the 'geo' URI, and offers the user
       to calculate a navigation route to the identified location.

   3.  Using the builtin GPS, the user follows the navgiation
       instructions from his phone to reach the destination


7.  GML Mappings

   The Geographic Markup Language (GML) by the Open Geospatial
   Consortium (OGC) is a set of XML schemas to represent geographical
   features.  Since GML is widely accepted, this document includes
   instructions on how to transpose 'geo' URIs from and to GML
   documents.

   A 'geo' URI can be mapped from a GML "point", and any 'geo' URI can
   be mapped to a GML "point" (given that both support the CRS used).
   For the following sections, "%lat%", "%lon%" and "%alt%" are
   placeholders for latitude, longitude, and altitude values.  Mappings
   are defined as follows:

7.1.  'geo' URI without altitude to GML 'Point'

   An instance of a WGS 84 'geo' URI without the altitude element is
   mapped to a two-dimensional GML "Point" as follows:

   'geo' URI:

       geo:%lat%,%lon%

   GML document:

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">
       <Point srsDimension="2"
              srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4326"
              xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/gml">
         <pos>%lat% %lon%</pos>
       </Point>

7.2.  'geo' URI with Altitude to GML 'Point'

   A WGS 84 'geo' URI instance with the altitude element is mapped to a
   three-dimensional GML "Point" as follows:

   'geo' URI:

       geo:%lat%,%lon%,%alt%

   GML document:

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">
       <Point srsDimension="3"
              srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4979"
              xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/gml">
         <pos>%lat% %lon% %alt%</pos>
       </Point>

7.3.  GML 'Point' without Altitude to 'geo' URI

   A GML 'Point' in the reference system identified as
   "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4326" is mapped to a 'geo' URI as follows:

   GML document:

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">
       <Point srsDimension="2"
              srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4326"
              xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/gml">
         <pos>%lat% %lon%</pos>
       </Point>

   'geo' URI:

       geo:%lat%,%lon%

   Note: GML documents in other reference systems MAY be used as well if
   a transformation into "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4326" is defined and
   applied before the mapping step.

7.4.  GML 'Point' with Altitude to 'geo' URI

   A GML 'Point' in the reference system identified as
   "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4979" is mapped to a 'geo' URI as follows:

   GML document:

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">
       <Point srsDimension="3"
              srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4979"
              xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/gml">
         <pos>%lat% %lon% %alt%</pos>
       </Point>

   'geo' URI:

       geo:%lat%,%lon%,%alt%

   Note: GML 'Point' instances in other reference systems could be used
   as well if a transformation into "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4979" is
   defined and applied before the mapping step.  It should be noted that
   such reprojections are typically not lossless because of the limited
   accuracy of the mathematical calculations involved.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests assignment of the 'geo' URI scheme in the IETF
   part of the URI scheme tree, according to the guidelines in BCP 115
   (RFC 4395) [RFC4395].  The definitions required for the assignment
   are contained in Section 4.

9.  Security Considerations

   Because the 'geo' URI is not tied to any specific protocol, and
   identifies a physical location rather than a network resource, most
   of the general security considerations on URIs (Section 7 of RFC
   3986) do not apply.  However, the following (additional) issues
   apply:

9.1.  Invalid Locations

   The URI syntax (Section 4.3) makes it possible to construct valid
   'geo' URIs which don't identify a valid location on earth.
   Applications MUST NOT use URIs which such invalid values, and SHOULD
   warn the user when such URIs are encountered.

   An example of such an invalid URI would be <geo:94,0> (latitude
   "beyond" north pole).

9.2.  Location Privacy

   Location information about individuals is an extremely sensitive
   topic, especially when location is combined with Personally
   Identifyable Information (PII).  Authors of 'geo' URIs MUST consider
   data protection and privacy before publishing such URIs.

   However, it should be noted that a 'geo' URI by itself is just opaque
   location information, and privacy considerations typically arise only
   when such opaque location information is put in context by combining
   it with other information (for example, embedding it within a message
   to reflect the current location of a person).
