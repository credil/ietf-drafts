1.  Introduction

   Managing energy consumption of devices with network connections is
   different from several well understood network management functions
   because of the special nature of energy supply and consumption.

   The most basic example of energy management is a single device
   reporting information about its own energy status.

   However, in many cases, energy consumption is not measured by the
   powered device itself, but by a power meter located upstream in the
   power distribution tree.  An example is a power distribution unit
   (PDU) that measures energy consumption of attached devices and may
   report this to an energy management system.  Unlike many other
   management functions, the powered device is not involved in this
   process.

   This memo aims to clarify roles of entities involved in energy
   monitoring and control and the relationships among them.

   There is already a reference model defined in section 4 of
   [I-D.claise-power-management-arch].  The intention of this memo is to
   refine this model based on recent discussions.

   The reference model specification below describes several kinds of
   entities and interactions between them.  According to the current
   scope of the EMAN WG, only reporting to the energy management system
   are potential subjects of standardization in this WG.

   The reference model is described in two stages.  Stage one is an
   energy monitoring model specified in Section 3.  It covers only
   monitoring of power states and energy consumption.  On stage two the
   monitoring model is extended to a full energy management reference
   model by adding control functions for power supply and power states.
   see Section 4.


2.  Terminology

   This section defines terms used for the description of the energy
   management reference model.  Names for entities of the model are not
   defined here but in Section 3.2 and Section 4.1.

2.1.  Energy Management

   Energy management deals with assessing and influencing the
   consumption of energy in a network of powered devices.  A typical
   objective of energy management is reducing the energy consumption in



Quittek & Nordman       Expires September 1, 2011               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    Reference Model for Energy Management    February 2011


   the network.  This objective may be limited by other objectives of a
   general network management system, such as service level objectives.

2.2.  Energy Monitoring

   Energy monitoring is a part of energy management.  It only covers
   monitoring and does not include influencing the consumption of
   energy.

2.3.  Power, Energy, and Energy Consumption

   Power is the rate of energy conversion.  In energy management
   scenarios, electrical energy is delivered to a device that consumes
   it by converting the energy to other forms.

   Power and consumed energy are essential quantities for network
   management.  Power can be an instantaneous value of the current
   energy conversion rate or an average value of power over a time
   interval.  Consumed energy is the total energy converted by a powered
   device during a time interval.

   The term 'energy consumption' is commonly used for both, for
   referring to the amount of consumed energy and also for referring to
   the process of consuming energy.  In this document we use this
   ambiguous term for addressing both power and consumed energy.

2.4.  Identity

   Identity is basic information about what a device is, in function, in
   its specific instance of manufacture, and its specific local human-
   readable name.  Identity is not energy-specific, but essential for
   useful interpretation of energy information.

   Some identify information never changes.  The rest of it rarely or
   never changes.  Thus, it needs to be queried much less frequently
   than the energy data.


3.  Energy Monitoring Reference Model

   This section specifies a reference model for energy monitoring.
   After introducing basic concepts of energy monitoring in Section 3.1
   it defines entities of the model and their interactions in
   Section 3.2.  Examples of devices and scenarios are illustrated in
   Section 3.5.

3.1.  Introduction to Energy Monitoring

   In this section we introduce basic concepts of energy monitoring
   starting with the most basic scenario and extending it stepwise to
   our full reference model.

   The main subject of energy monitoring is a powered device.  An energy
   monitoring system collects information about powered devices, their
   current power state (for example: on, sleep, off) and their actual
   power consumption.

3.1.1.  Basic Energy Monitoring (local metering)

   The most basic interaction in an energy monitoring system is a
   powered device directly reporting its own energy-related information,
   with no other devices involved, as shown below.

                            energy monitoring

                                    ^

                                 device

3.1.2.  External Metering

   Reporting its current power state is a relatively easy task for a
   powered device because usually information on the current power state
   is locally available at the device and a reporting function just
   needs some additional software to implement it.

   Reporting the current power level of a device and its accumulated
   energy consumption is a harder task, particularly if there are strict
   requirements for accuracy.  Today very few devices are instrumented
   with means for measuring their own energy consumption as that usually
   implies adding hardware for this purpose.

   This can be addressed by external meters, that is, dedicated probes
   that can meter energy consumption on a power source (line).  Some
   Power Distributions Units (PDUs) and Power over Ethernet (PoE)
   [IEEE-802.3af] switches integrate power source and power metering for
   individual devices.

   For supporting scenarios with external meters we extend the basic
   model from above by an external power meter and a power source as
   shown below.

                              ###############

              symbols ######### represent a power supply line

   All three potentially report to the energy monitoring system.  The
   power meter may report the current power and accumulated energy
   consumption and the power source may report if the power supply for
   the device is switched on or if it is off.

   Implementation may be incomplete.  For example, an energy management
   system may have access to only one or two of these three types of
   data.

3.1.3.  Functions and Entities

   This reference model operates at two levels/layers.  One is simple
   basic functions that are implemented.  The second is how they are
   arranged in devices.  A device in this model may implement only a
   single function, or may implement many.

   That is, having multiple entities does not require that all of them
   need to be instantiated by individual devices.  For example, the
   power meter function may be co-located and integrated with the
   powered device, with the power source, or it may be implemented by a
   separate device.

3.1.4.  Power Monitors

   In the models above, the powered device and other components deliver
   reports directly to an energy monitoring system.  However, there are
   energy monitoring scenarios where this is not possible or not
   desirable.

   Extreme examples are energy consumers that do not have IP interfaces
   but can communicate by other means.  For delivering their reports to
   an IP-based energy monitoring system, it may be required to use a
   gateway that can communicate with the energy monitoring system.

   However, even if all involved devices (PDUs, power meters, and
   powered devices) can communicate via IP, it may be desirable to have
   mediation functions in place between powered devices and the energy
   monitoring system.  An example, is an aggregating device that
   aggregates and reports information on several powered devices.

   There are several further useful scenarios.  To generalize the model
   (and to not exclude any kind of gateway, proxy, relay, mediator or
   other device) we define reporting entities called 'monitors'.  The
   figure below shows three monitors, each of which reports to the
   energy monitoring system.  This figure is the most generic
   representation of the energy monitoring reference model described by
   this document.

              symbols ######### represent a power supply line

   A monitor function reports directly to the energy monitoring system
   using the EMON protocol (an Internet protocol).  A monitor must have
   means to acquire the information it reports, but how this information
   is acquired is not relevant for our model.  That is, only the
   interactions with a caret symbol in this and following diagrams is
   the subject of standardization.  Those with only the vertical bar
   character are outside the scope of these documents; they may be IP or
   non-IP.

   The reference model defines the communication between power monitors
   an the energy monitoring system.  The communication lines between
   these entities are reference points of our model described in more
   detail in the following.

3.2.  Energy Monitoring Entities

   This section defines entities of the energy monitoring reference
   model and describes interactions between them.  Examples scenarios
   are illustrated in Section 3.5.

3.2.1.  Powered Device

   A powered device is provided with energy (typically electrical)
   usuallly provided via power lines.  Power state, power and consumed
   energy of powered devices are subject to monitoring and control
   functions of energy management.

3.2.2.  Power Source

   A power source provides a powered device with energy, typically via a
   power line.  It may have means to switch on and off the power for the
   powered device.  A power source does not necessarily generate power,
   but it may do so.  It may be as simple as a power switch or a power
   plug, but it may also be a battery or a power generator.  Regardless,
   the nature of the source does not affect energy monitoring.

   Note that an internal battery within a device, such as the battery of
   a notebok PC or of a mobile phone are not considered to be a power
   source.  When a device runs on battery only, there is n flow of
   energy into the device and consequently the power to be reported for
   this device is zero.  On the other hand, when a device charges its
   battery, then the power supplied for charging needs to be accounted,
   even if the device is not operational.

3.2.3.  Power Meter

   A power meter measures power and/or consumed energy, and typically is
   electrically connected to power supply lines for powered devices.
   However, many devices can also provide a reliable estimate of their
   power consumption based on internal status information without having
   dedicated metering hardware.  Regardless, all metering information is
   qualified by an indication of its accuracy.

   The meter function also includes integrating power consumption over
   time to provide a "meter reading" with a time stamp to enable an
   energy monitoring system to track energy consumption over time.

3.2.4.  Power Monitors

   A power monitor has access to energy-related information concerning
   powered devices and is able to report this information to energy
   management systems.

   A power monitor may also provide information on identity and
   properties of a powered device to the management system.

   A power monitor may store energy-related information and process it,
   for example, for aggregating information or for extracting statistics

   that are provided to an energy management system.

   There are three power monitor functions in the energy monitoring
   reference model: power state monitors, power source monitors, and
   power usage monitors.

3.2.4.1.  Power State Monitor

   A power state monitor has access to the power state of a powered
   device and is able to report this information to an energy monitoring
   system.  For acquiring power state information it may interact with
   powered devices.

3.2.4.2.  Power Source Monitor

   A power state monitor has access to information on the power supply
   of powered devices and is able to report this information to an
   energy monitoring system.  Typically, it will just report either 'on'
   or 'off'.  In addition, it may report on power availability.  For
   acquiring power source information it may interact with the power
   sources of powered devices.

3.2.4.3.  Power Usage Monitor

   A power usage monitor has access to information on energy consumption
   of powered devices and is able to report this information to energy
   management systems.  For acquiring information on energy consumption
   it may interact with power meters.

3.2.5.  Energy Monitoring System

   An energy monitoring system receives information from power monitors,
   such as: power states, power source states, and energy consumption.
   An energy monitoring system may be centralized or distributed.  In
   most of the example scenarios illustrated in Section 3.5 a
   centralized energy monitoring system is shown but in all cases can be
   replaced by a distributed monitoring system.

3.3.  Standardization Scope

   The reference model specifies interactions of an energy monitoring
   system with power monitors.  They reference points of the model are
   potential subjects of standardization (in the EMAN working group).
   Interactions of power monitors with other entities are currently not
   considered to be subject of standardization.

   It is argued in [I-D.quittek-power-monitoring-requirements] that for
   most of the relevant scenarios the best choice a management protocol

   for the reference points is SNMP [RFC3410].  The reference model
   defined in this document does not assume a specific protocol between
   energy monitoring system and power monitors.  It is also applicable
   if other protocols, such as, for example, Syslog [RFC5675] or IPFIX
   [RFC5101] are used.

3.4.  Entity Relationships

   No restrictions on entity relationships have been identified for
   interacting entities of the energy monitoring reference model
   specified in this document.  This means that all relationships
   between entities may be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or
   many-to-many.  For example,
   o  a single power state monitor may report the power state of
      multiples powered entities,
   o  a single powered entity may have its power states reported by<
      multiple power state monitors,
   o  a single powered device may receive power from several power
      sources,
   o  a single power monitor may report to multiple energy monitoring
      systems.
   A few of scenarios with multiple instances of units are illustrated
   by the examples in the following Section 3.5.

3.5.  Energy Monitoring Scenarios

   This section describes common example scenarios for energy monitoring
   and how they are modeled with the entities and interactions described
   in the previous sections.

3.5.1.  Simple Device with Power Meter

   A very basic example is a powered device that has a built-in meter
   for measuring its own energy consumption and that reports its power
   state and power usage directly to the energy monitoring system.

        Scenario 1: Powered device metering and self-reporting

   Here four entities are combined in a single device: the powered
   device, the power meter, and two power monitors.

3.5.2.  External Power Meter

   The second example shows a power meter that is attached to the power
   line of a powered device that does not have means for measuring its
   own energy consumption.  The meter is integrated with a power usage
   monitor that reports metered data.  The powered device may report its
   own power state by an integrated power state monitor.

                     Scenario 2: An external meter

3.5.3.  External Power Meter for Multiple Powered Devices

   Power meters may be located at a power line that provides power for
   multiple powered devices.  In scenario 3, a single power meter
   measures the accumulated power and energy consumption of multiple
   powered devices.  In general, In this scenario it is usually not
   possible to derive power values for the individual powered devices
   from the accumulated measurement.

          Scenario 3: An external meter for multiple powered devices

3.5.4.  Powered Device with Dual Power Supply

   Some powered devices have dual power supply.  It may be that one
   supply comes from a power grid and the other one from a battery.
   High-reliability devices may have two power sources from different
   power distribution networks, as shown in scenarios 4 and 5.

          Scenario 4: powered device with dual power supply

   In scenario 4 the device uses two meters, one for each power line and
   reports from both to the energy monitoring system.  If the two power
   sources belong to different power distribution domains, it may be
   necessary to report power and energy separately for each supply.

3.5.5.  Two energy monitoring systems

   Scenario 5 is more complex.  Both meters are individual external
   devices and there are even two separate energy monitoring systems
   involved, one for each power distribution tree.

3.5.6.  Power over Ethernet Switch

   This example shows a Power over Ethernet (PoE) [IEEE-802.3af] switch
   supplying a powered device.  The switch contains a power source and a
   meter for each of its ports.

   There typically are multiple instances of power sources and power
   meters in a PoE switch, but the drawing below shows only a single
   instance.  The same applies to the powered devices that are
   represented by a single instance only.

   Note that a typical PoE switch has also means to control power supply
   for powered devices (not shown here).  Control of power supply is a
   subject of Section 4.

     Scenarios 6 & 7: Power over Ethernet switch or Power Distribution
     Unit reporting on power source and power usage of powered devices

   In this scenario the identification of the powered device can be done
   by the PoE switch by observing MAC and IP addresses of the powered
   devices.  The switch can report them to the energy management system
   which then in turn can contact the devices directly to obtain further
   information.

3.5.7.  Power Distribution Unit

   The same figure as used for the PoE switch in the previous section is
   be used for scenario 7 modeling a power distribution unit (PDU).  A
   PDU with meters for every socket can report power for each.

   Identifying the powered devices can more difficult in this scenario
   than in the previous one with the PoE switch, because the PDU does
   not necessarily communicate with the powered devices.  In this case
   the PDU or EMS needs to obtain this information by other means, for
   example by manual configuration.

3.5.8.  Aggregator

   Scenario 8 shows a power usage monitor acting as an aggregator.  It
   collects power information from three powered devices and delivers
   all of the information to the energy monitoring system.  The

   aggregator may deliver the full information or aggregated
   information, for example, just the sum of the power of all three
   powered devices.

3.5.9.  Energy Monitoring Gateway

   Some energy monitoring scenarios include a gateway between the
   monitored units and the energy monitoring system.  The powered device
   and the power meter may use means of communication other than IP.

   The gateway is a relay and protocol converter that delivers energy
   information to a power monitor.  A single device may implement
   logically independent gateways for multiple devices.

   Scenario 9 can easily extended to a gateway that also contains a
   power source monitor.

                Scenario 9: A gateway between monitored devices
                         and energy monitoring system

   Here again, the problem of identifying the powered device has become
   very difficult, because neither can the power monitor provide an IP
   address of the powered device to the energy management system nor can
   the energy management system directly communicate with the powered
   device.  Identification must be provided by other means.  The Proxy
   can have a gateway function and relay identification between powered
   device and energy management system or the energy management system
   needs to acquire information on powered devices by other means, such
   as manual configuration.

3.5.10.  Further Scenarios

   More scenarios may be added to future versions of this document.
   Particularly, scenarios with multiple instances of an entity have not
   been elaborated a lot.  Section 4.4 shows scenarios for energy
   control.  They can also be considered as further monitoring scenarios
   if only their power monitors are considered and power controllers are
   ignored.


4.  Energy Management Reference Model

   This section extends the energy monitoring reference model specified
   in the previous Section 3 by adding power control functions.  The

   resulting model is a complete energy management reference model.

   As in Section 3 we first discuss entities and their relationships and
   then illustrate the model with example scenarios.

   The extension from energy monitoring to energy management is straight
   forward.  To achieve the required control functions the power source,
   power meter, and powered device have additional functions for
   control.  For each power monitor a corresponding power controller is
   added as shown below.

4.1.  Energy Management Entities

   This section defines entities of the energy management reference
   model and describes interactions between them.  Examples scenarios
   are illustrated in Section 4.4.  For entities already specified in
   Section 3.2 of the energy monitoring reference model, only their
   additional properties are mentioned here.  Power monitors are not
   discussed here again, because their specification in the energy
   management reference model do not change.

4.1.1.  Powered Device

   A powered device may be capable of changing its own power state from
   a request from the energy management system.  Some devices may not be
   able to power up from an off state based on EMS request.  Most
   devices that are asleep will be able to wake on EMES request.

Internet-Draft    Reference Model for Energy Management    February 2011


4.1.2.  Power Source

   A power source may be capable of switching on and off power for
   powered devices.

4.1.3.  Power Meter

   A power meter may be switched on or off or have its metering
   parameters modified.

4.1.4.  Power Controllers

   A power controller receives commands from an energy management system
   to change the status or parameters of power sources, power meters, or
   powered devices.

   There are three kinds of power controller entities: power state
   controllers, power source controllers, and power meter controllers.

4.1.4.1.  Power State Controller

   A power state controller can initiate a change in the power state of
   a powered device.

4.1.4.2.  Power Source Controller

   A power source controller can change the power supply of a powered
   device.  Typically, it has means for switching power supply on and
   off.  It may use these means without communicating with the affected
   powered device.

4.1.4.3.  Power Meter Controller

   A power meter controller has means for influencing the operation of a
   power meter.  It may switch on and off the power meters and change
   parameters of their operation.  For this purpose it may interact with
   power meters.

4.1.5.  Energy Management System

   An energy management system is an energy monitoring system extended
   by control functions.  It interacts with power monitors and power
   controllers in order to achieve objectives of energy management.

   It sends commands to power controllers.  To power state controllers
   it sends requested power states for powered devices.  To power source
   controllers it requests to switch on or off power for powered
   devices.  To power meter controllers it sends commands concerning the

   operation of power meters.

4.2.  Reference Points

   Relevant for our reference model are interactions of the energy
   management system with power monitors and power controllers.  They
   are reference points of our model and potential subjects of
   standardization in the EMAN working group.  Interactions of power
   monitors and power controllers with other entities are currently not
   considered to be subject of standardization.

   Monitoring protocols have already been discussed in Section 3.3.
   There are several choices of control protocols to be used for energy
   management.  Among them are SNMP [RFC3410] and NETCONF [RFC4741].

4.3.  Entity Relationships

   The considerations on entity relationships for the energy monitoring
   reference model described in Section 3.4. apply as well to the energy
   management reference model: No restrictions on entity relationships
   have been identified.

4.4.  Energy Management Scenarios

   This section describes example scenarios for energy management and
   how they are modeled with the entities and interactions described
   above.

4.4.1.  Simple Self-Managed Device

   The first two examples are expected to become very common scenarios.
   Here, a powered device is managing its power state on its own based
   on input other than from the energy management system.  The device
   may decide to change power state based on observation of its
   environment (no current load, high temperature, not sufficient light,
   scheduled time for service interruption, etc.) or it may receive
   external triggers, such as by a human-operated remote control.

                  Scenario 10: A self-managed powered device

   In any way, it's power state control is independent of the energy
   management system.  The only interaction with the system is reporting
   of power state to the energy management system in scenario 10, and in
   addition reporting of its current power and/or accumulated consumed
   energy in scenario 11.

       Scenario 11: A self-managed powered device with built-in meter

   In scenario 11 also the control of the power meter is handled by the
   device itself.

4.4.2.  Simple Managed Device

   In our model, the scenario does not change much if the powered
   devices are not self-managed but managed by the energy management
   system.  Scenarios 12 and 13 show that just an interaction between
   the energy management system and the powered device is added that
   serves for sending commands concerning power states to the device.

   this seems not to be necessary in many common cases.

   looks exactly the same in our reference model as the scenario for a
   power distribution unit.

4.4.5.  Energy Management Gateway

   Starting from an energy monitoring gateway in Section 3.5 the
   extension towards an energy management gateway is again straight
   forward.

              Scenario 16: A gateway between powered devices
                         and energy monitoring system

   Here again, the problem of identifying the powered device has become
   very difficult, because neither can the power monitor provide an IP
   address of the powered device to the energy management system nor can
   the energy management system directly communicate with the powered
   device.  Identification must be provided by other means.  The Proxy
   can have a gateway function and relay identification between powered
   device and energy management system or the energy management system
   needs to acquire information on powered devices by other means, such
   as manual configuration.

4.4.6.  Further Scenarios

   More scenarios may be added to future versions of this document.
   Particularly, scenarios with multiple instances of an entity have not
   been elaborated, yet.  Section 4.4 shows scenarios for energy
   control.  They can also be considered as further monitoring scenarios
   if only their power monitors are considered and power controllers are
   ignored.


5.  Security Considerations

   This memo currently does not impose any security considerations.

   Parello, Mouli Chandramouli, Rolf Winter, Thomas Dietz, Bill Mielke,
   and Chris Verges at IETF #79.


8.  Open Isues

8.1.  Short name for the protocol

   We talk a lot in this document about reporting energy-related
   information to an energy management system.  For this purpose the
   SNMP protocol will be used and required MIB modules are under
   development at the EMAN WG.  It may simplify the text if we can refer
   to the process of reporting energy-related information with a
   placeholder, for example, 'EMON' for energy monitoring.

8.2.  Identity Monitor

   Shall we add a new building block called 'identity Monitor'?.  This
   would tie in the work of the so-called POWER-AWARE-MIB.

8.3.  Interactions with the EMS

   Shall we discuss different kinds of interactions with the EMS?  These
   would include

   o  broadcasting to a subnet asking for all power monitors to report,
   o  addressing a specific device and asking for all power monitor
      information it has,
   o  asking a specific device about itself,
   o  asking a specific device for specific information, which could
      include particular proxied devices, or pieces of EMON (state,
      meter, source, identity), aggregated data, or collected data.

   Basically, these interactions are all cvered bythe IETF netwrk
   management framework.  The question is whether to mention it
   explicitly in the reference model.

8.4.  Third basic state for power source?

   So far, a power source has the two basic states 'on' and 'off'.
   Should we describe a third basic state for a power source.  This
   would be minimal (?trickle) power to enable communications but not
   activity.  Would this model the way USB and PoE work?  EMON would not
   specify the quantity of this power, but an EMS will know typical
   levels for relevant physical layer technologies.

8.5.  Collector and Aggregator

   It looks like we need to extend the model by a collctor function and
   an agregators function.  A collector would collect energy-related
   information on other devices and report for multiple of them.  An
   aggregator would use information from several devices and exceute
   operations n them, for example calculating a sum.

8.6.  Gateways and Proxies

   Is a gateway rather a scenario or a function?  Scenarios 9 and 16 may
   need to be revised.  In scenario 9 we talk about a 'proxy'.  We need
   to explain what we mean with 'proxy'.
