	<t>Message Submission on port 587 has seen significant deployment over the past 8-10 years, becoming widespread in the past 2-3 years.  There are several reasons for this, such as decisions by many ISPs and organizations in general to block outbound port 25 (except by their own border MTAs), and consequently to support 587 with authentication, as well as recognition of the need to apply different policies to submission and relay.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Proposed Changes">
        <t>The YAM WG proposes making the following changes in a revision:
	</t>
        <t>
	  <list style="hanging">
	    <t hangText="Client behavioral differences:">
	      Submission clients behave differently from relay client in some areas, especially tolerance for time-outs.  In practice, message submission clients tend to have short time-outs (perhaps 2-5 minutes for a reply to any command) while relay clients are required to have per-command timeouts of as much as 10 minutes).  The document should describe this, and perhaps say that submission servers SHOULD respond to any command (even DATA) in fewer than 2 minutes.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="Technical errata: NO-SOLICITING">
	      Per http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=4409, the reference for [NO-SOLICITING] is incorrect and needs to be fixed to be RFC 3865.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="Technical errata: Additional SMTP extensions">
	      Per request reported at http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=4409, the following RFC extensions which do not themselves specify their validity for Submission should be added to the table in Section 7:
	      <list>
	      <t>RFC 2645  -- ATRN -- MUST NOT</t>
          <t>RFC 2852  -- DELIVERBY -- MAY</t>
          <t>RFC 4141  -- CONPERM, CONNEG -- MAY</t>
          </list>
          Note that other subsequently-published extensions, such as UTF8SMTP and BURL, do specify their validity and hence don't need to be included.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="Technical errata: References">
	      <list>
	      <t>Per request reported at http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=4409, the [ESMTP] and [SMTP-MTA] references should be updated.
	      Accordingly, [ESMTP]'s STD 10 should refer to RFC 5321-bis instead of both RFC 1869 and RFC 821.</t>
	      <t>The reference to RFC 974 should be deleted as the relevant material is included in 5321.</t>  
	      <t>Likewise, the reference to STD 3, RFC 1123 should also be deleted from both [SMTP-MTA] and [MESSAGE-FORMAT] as its relevant material is also in RFC 5321.</t>
	      </list>
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="Updated references:">
	      SMTP AUTH should be RFC 4954 instead of 2554.  This is a downref.  Note that the current RFC 4409 lists 2554 as an Informative, not Normative reference, even though AUTH is a MUST.</t>
	    <t>Likewise, IPSec should be RFC 4301.</t>

            <t>
	      Excluding the previous proposed changes and expected IESG
	      support for technically substantive IETF last call feedback,
	      does the IESG believe any additional changes are critical to
	      advance this document from draft to full standard?
	      If so, please provide sufficient information so the WG can address
	      these issues prior to IETF last call or determine that the document
	      is inappropriate for the YAM WG to process at this time.
	    </t>
            <t>Does the IESG consider the downward references acceptable
	      for a full standard?
	      If not, please cite which specific
	      downward reference or references are problematic and why
	      so the WG can address these issues prior to IETF last call
	      or determine the document is inappropriate for the YAM WG
	      to process at this time.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
