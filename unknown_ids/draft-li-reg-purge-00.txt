                  IS-IS Registry Extension for Purges
                         draft-li-reg-purge-00

Abstract

   IANA maintains the IS-IS TLV Codepoint Registry.  This registry
   documents which TLVs can appear in different types of IS-IS PDUs, but
   does not document which TLVs can be found in zero Remaining Lifetime
   LSP (a.k.a., purges).  This document extends the existing registry to
   record the set of TLVs that are permissible in purges.

Internet-Draft        Registry Extension for Purges          August 2010


1.  Introduction

   The IS-IS [ISO 10589] routing protocol maintains a link state
   database of the topology of its routing domain by flooding a set of
   Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs).  When the protocol no longer
   needs the information stored in an LSP, it uses the purge mechanism
   to cause the Intermediate Systems (ISes) in its domain to discard the
   information contained in the LSP.  The process for generating purges
   can be found in Section 7.3.16.4 of [ISO 10589].  This process
   retains only the LSP header, discarding any TLVs that had been
   carried within the LSP.

   Subsequent enhancements to IS-IS, such as [RFC5304], amend the
   process of generating a purge and allow the inclusion of certain TLVs
   in purges.

   This document extends the current IS-IS TLV Codepoint Registry,
   defined in [RFC3563], to record the set of TLVs that can be found in
   purges.  This will serve as an aid to subsequent documents, which can
   then refer to the registry as the definitive list of the TLVs allowed
   in purges.  This will also act as an aid to implementors, providing
   them with an easily accessible compendium of allowable TLVs.


2.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA modify the IS-IS 'TLV Codepoints
   Registry' by adding a column in the registry for 'Purge'.  A 'y' in
   this column indicates that the TLV for this row can be found in a
   purge.  A 'n' in this column indicates that the TLV for this row
   cannot be found in a purge.

   The 'Purge' column should initially contain a 'y' for TLV type 10
   (Authentication).  All other entries in this column should have an
   'n'.


3.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security issues.
