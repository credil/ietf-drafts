Internet-Draft             Unicode Codepoints                   May 2007


1.  Introduction

   RFC 4690 [RFC4690] suggests an inclusion based approach for selecting
   the codepoints from The Unicode Standard [Unicode5] that should be
   included in the list of codepoints that may be used in
   Internationalized Domain Names.

   Specifically, RFC 4690 [RFC4690] says the following:

      The IAB has concluded that there is a consensus within the broader
      community that lists of code points should be specified by the use
      of an inclusion-based mechanism (i.e., identifying the characters
      that are permitted), rather than by excluding a small number of
      characters from the total Unicode set as Stringprep [RFC3454] and
      Nameprep [RFC3491] do today.  That conclusion should be reviewed
      by the IETF community and action taken as appropriate.

   This document reviews the collections of codepoints in Unicode from
   by looking at various properties of the codepoints, and defines a
   derived property that identify groups of characters.

   o  Those that should clearly be included in IDNs
   o  Those that should clearly not be included in IDNs
   o  Those where no final determination can be made at this time

   There is a need for many categories and not only two because there
   are complex trade offs involved and sometimes just due to lack of
   sufficient information.  It is based on Unicode 5.0, rather than the
   earlier Unicode 3.2, in order to take advantage of the expanded
   character repertoire and better definitions in the newer version.
   The mechanisms described here allow determination of the value of the
   property for characters added after Unicode 5.0, so should be
   suitable for newer revisions of Unicode, as long as the properties on
   which it is based remain stable.

   Some combinations of allowed codepoints are not advisable for use in
   IDNs, due to rules specific to a script or class of characters; these
   rules are described in other documents.

   Some codepoints need to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, but
   should be excluded in all other cases; these rules are also described
   in other documents.  The most notable of these are the ZERO WIDTH
   JOINER (U+200D) and ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER (U+200C).

   This document is part of a series that, together, constitute a
   preliminary proposal for updating the IDNA standards to resolve
   issues uncovered in recent years, cover a broader range of scripts,
   and provide for migration to newer versions of Unicode.  See

   [IDNA-issues] for a broader discussion.


2.  The rules used

   The derived property get its value based on a series of rules, rules
   that are based on core properties defined by the Unicode Standard as
   well as other data about the codepoint such as what script and block
   the codepoint belong to.  It only in one of the rules set the value
   based on what explicit codepoint is tested, and that is for
   compatibility with "traditional DNS" where uppercase letters A-Z are
   allowed.

   For each rule, it is specified whether it is a rule that increase or
   decrease the value of the property (regarding likelihood to be
   included in a U-label), how the rule is calculated (where in the
   Unicode Standard the data for the rule is found), and sometimes other
   comments and notes related to the rule or the data used to calculate
   the rule.

   In many cases aliases are used in the data in the Unicode Standard.
   As long as possible this document tries to use the spelled out terms
   (for example Lowercase_Letter) and not the alias (Ll) although in the
   rules, the shorthand version is used.

2.1.  Rule A - Classes of characters

   generalCategory(cp) is in {Ll, Lu, Lo, Lm, Mn, Mc, Nd}

   The rule is intended to include characters commonly used in
   identifiers, and will not be changed.

   The generalCategory of a codepoint is found in UnicodeData.txt in the
   third column.  The mapping between the alias (for example Ll) and the
   name of the general category is found in PropertyValueAliases.txt
   under the heading General_Category.

   The categories used in this rule are:
   o  Ll - Lowercase_Letter
   o  Lu - Uppercase_Letter
   o  Lo - Other_Letter
   o  Lm - Modifier_Letter
   o  Mn - Nonspacing_Mark
   o  Mc - Spacing_Mark
   o  Nd - Decimal_Number

2.2.  Rule B - Normalization

   NFKC(cp) != cp

   The rule is intended to exclude all characters that change under
   normalization, and will not be changed.

   The normalization algorithm NFKC is defined as NFKD (canonical)
   decomposition followed by canonical composition.  Normalization rules
   are found in UnicodeData.txt in the sixth column.  The data (sixth
   column) include both the normalization and, in the case of canonical
   and not compatibilty mapping, also the decomposition type (within
   angle brackets).  An exclusion table for composition exists in
   CompositionExclusions.txt.  Singleton decompostions are never
   composed.  Hangul is decomposed and composed according to an
   algorithm specified in the Unicode Standard.

   It has been discussed whether NFC should be used instead of NFKC.

   Known codepoints that have issues with normalization include U+0140
   (LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH MIDDLE DOT) that belong to General
   Category Ll while the normalized data is U+006C U+00B7 (LATIN SMALL
   LETTER L followed by MIDDLE DOT) where U+00B7 is of General Category
   Po (Punctuation_Other).  This implies that if this rule make the
   codepoint not be included, and instead the decomposed set of
   codepoints should be used, other rules that look at the General
   Category of the codepoint might reject one or more codepoints in the
   decomposed codepoint.

2.3.  Rule C - Casefolding

   casefold(cp) != cp

   The rule is intended to exclude all characters that change when
   folded to lower case, and will not be changed.

   Case folding rules can in general be found in UnicodeData.txt in the
   14th column.  A table with special cases can be found in
   SpecialCasing.txt.  The SpecialCasing.txt file do include both
   general casing rules, but also conditional mappings.  Only
   unconditional mappings are included in the rule.  One can see whether
   the mapping is conditional or not in the 6th column of
   SpecialCasing.txt.  If the column is empty, the mapping is
   unconditional.

   Known codepoints with case folding that is difficult include U+00DF
   (LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S) and U+0130 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH
   DOT ABOVE).

2.4.  Rule D - Ignorables

   property(cp) is in {Other_Default_Ignorable_Code_Point,
                       Noncharacter_Code_Point}

   The rule is intended to exclude ignorable characters, and will not be
   changed.

   Properties codepoints have are listed in PropList.txt.

   Note that there are also derived properties in
   DerivedCoreProperties.txt, which are not used for reasons explained
   above.  It has been discussed whether Default_Ignorable_Code_Point
   should be used, but as that is a derived property, it is not used.
   The definition is

   Other_Default_Ignorable_Code_Point + Cf + Cc + Cs + Noncharacters
   - White_Space - FFF9..FFFB (Annotation Characters)

   (see DerivedCoreProperties.txt) where Noncharacters is a property
   only existing in the NamesList.txt.  The property seems to be similar
   to the Noncharacter_Code_Point defined in PropList.txt, but the
   properties are not aliases.

2.5.  Rule E - Obsolete scripts

   script(cp) in {Cuneiform, Ugaritic, Old_Persian, Gothic, Old_Italic,
                  Cypriot, Linear_B, Phoenician, Kharoshthi, Phags_Pa,
                  Glagolitic, Shavian, Deseret, Osmanya, Ogham}

   The rule is intended to exclude obsolete scripts.  Scripts may be
   added to or removed from the list in the future.

   What script a codepoint belongs to is listed in Scripts.txt.  Note
   that aliases for scripts can be found in PropertyValueAliases.txt, so
   Xsux is for example an alias for the script Cuneiform.

2.6.  Rule F - Blocks of characters

 block(cp) in {Combining_Diacritical_Marks_for_Symbols, Musical_Symbols,
               Ancient_Greek_Musical_Notation}

   The rule is intended to exclude characters not useful for
   identifiers.  Blocks may be added to or removed from the list in the
   future.

   What block a codepoint belongs to is listed in Blocks.txt.

2.7.  Rule G - ASCII

   cp is in [-A-Z0-9]

   The rule is intended to make sure all ASCII characters are allowed,
   in conformance with rules for non-IDNA hostnames.  It will not be
   changed.

   The characters in this rule is defined by the ASCII characters.  What
   the rule say is that anything that was part of LDH (Letter, Digit,
   Hyphen) definition is also allowed in a U-label.

2.8.  Rule H - Stable scripts

   script(cp) in {Latin, Greek, Cyrillic}

   The rule is intended to show which scripts have encodings are stable
   enough for use in IDNs.  New scripts may be added in the future,
   possibly with additional documentation for whole-label rules relevant
   to that script, but no script will be removed.

   It has been seeded with the script that subsumes ASCII plus the two
   scripts most proximal to it, and it is expected that other scripts
   will be added.  These scripts are stable enough so that the
   characters placed into the NEVER category by these rules cannot
   possibly be candidates for reassignment to the ALWAYS category.


3.  Calculation of the derived property

   The possible values of the properties are:

   o  ALWAYS
   o  MAYBE YES
   o  MAYBE NOT
   o  NEVER

   The algorithm to calculate the value of the derived property is as
   follows:
   o  If rule G is true, the value is ALWAYS.  Processing terminates.
   o  If rule E or F is true, the value is MAYBE NOT.  Processing
      terminates.
   o  If rule H is true, and at least one of rule B, C or D are true,
      the value is NEVER.
   o  If rule H is false, and at least one of rule B, C or D are true,
      the value is MAYBE NOT.

   o  If rule H is true, and rule A is false, the value is NEVER.
   o  If rule H is false, and rule A is false, the value is MAYBE NOT.
   o  If rule H is true, rule A is true, and all of rules B, C or D are
      false, the value is ALWAYS.
   o  If rule H is false, rule A is true, and all of rules B, C and D
      are false, the value is MAYBE YES.

   The reasoning behind treating Latin, Greek and Cyrillic differently
   from other scripts in rules A, B, C and D is that we feel confident
   that we understand these scripts well enough to be sure that the
   characters placed into the NEVER category by these rules cannot
   possibly be candidates for reassignment to the ALWAYS category.  As
   our confidence grows with regard to other scripts, we expect that
   they will be treated the same way.


4.  Codepoints

   If one apply these rules to the codepoints 0x0000 to 0xFFFF, the
   result is as follows.  One can also have a look at [codepoints] for a
   listing of all individual codepoints, per script.

4.1.  Codepoints in Unicode Character Database (UCD) format
