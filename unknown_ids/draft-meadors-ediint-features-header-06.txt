                        EDI-INT Features Header
                draft-meadors-ediint-features-header-06

Abstract

   With the maturity of the EDI-INT standard of AS1, AS2 and AS3,
   applications and additional features are being built upon the basic
   secure transport functionality.  These features are not necessarily
   supported by all EDI-INT applications and could cause potential
   problems with implementations.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                 April 2010


1.  Introduction

   EDI-INT applications provide for a secure means of payload document
   transport.  The original intent was for transport of a single EDI or
   XML document.  However, as AS1 [RFC3335], AS2 [RFC4130] and AS3
   [RFC4823] matured, other features and application logic were
   implemented upon EDI-INT standards.  Since these features go beyond
   but do not violate the basic premise of EDI-INT, a means is needed to
   communicate to trading partners features which are supported by the
   originating user agent.  The EDIINT Features header indicates the
   capability of the user agent to support the listed feature with its
   trading partner without out- of-band communication and agreement.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  EDIINT Features Header Syntax

   The EDIINT Features header can appear in the header section of an
   AS1, AS2 and AS3 message.  Its BNF syntax is listed below.

   Feature = "EDIINT-Features: " Feature-Name *("," Feature-Name)

   Feature-Name = Feature-Token

   Feature-Token = %d48-57 / ; 0-9

   %d65-90 / ; A-Z

   %d97-122 / ; a-z

   "-" ; blank space " " is not allowed

   The Feature-Token allows for feature names to be specified and can
   only contain alphanumeric characters along with the hyphen.  Feature
   names are case-insensitive.


3.  Implementation and Processing

   The EDIINT Features header indicates the originating user agent is
   capable of supporting the features listed.  The feature header MUST
   be present in all messages transmitted by the user agent and not just
   messages which utilize the feature.  Upon examination of the feature

   header, the trading partner SHOULD assume the user agent is capable
   of receiving messages utilizing any of the features listed.

   The features listed MUST be supported by existing IETF RFC or RFC-
   track Internet-draft standards.  These standards MUST describe the
   feature name which is listed in the header and the means which it
   should be used.


4.  EDI-INT Applications

   Since AS1 uses email and the EDIINT Features header is not a
   registered header with IANA, the header MUST be preceded by a "X-" to
   be used.  If the receiving trading partner does not support EDIINT
   Features, it can choose to ignore the header because of the "X-".
   Because AS2 and AS3 utilize transports of HTTP and FTP, respectively,
   which allow the application to ignore headers which it does not
   recognize, the addition of the EDIINT Features header in AS2 and AS3
   can be done without affecting trading partners who have not
   implemented the header.

   AS2 and AS3 applications currently use a version header, AS2-Version
   and AS3-Version, respectively, to indicate functional support.  The
   EDIINT Features header tremendously improves the purpose and function
   of the old version header.  However, to provide a connection from the
   old version header and the EDIINT Features header, AS2 and AS3
   applications which implement the EDIINT Features header MUST use the
   version value of "1.2" to indicate the support of the Feature header.
   Also, since version "1.1" indicates the implementation supports
   compression [RFC5402] and "1.2" builds upon "1.1", AS2-Version or
   AS3-Version of "1.2" MUST support compression regardless of whether
   it is mentioned as a feature in the EDIINT Features header.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   Because headers are often un-encrypted, it may be possible for the
   feature header to be altered.  Trading partners MAY consult out-of-
   band to confirm feature support.
