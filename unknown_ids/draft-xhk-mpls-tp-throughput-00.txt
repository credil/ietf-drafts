        Throughput Measurement for MPLS-based Transport Networks
                    draft-xhk-mpls-tp-throughput-00

Abstract

   An important Operation, Administration and Maintenance requirement of
   the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the ability to estimate/
   measure the throughput (i.e. bandwidth) of an MPLS-TP connection
   which could be an MPLS-TP LSP, PW or Section.  This document
   specifies the OAM packets and procedures for both one-way and two-way
   throughput estimation/measurement in MPLS-TP.

Internet-Draft        Thput Measurement for MPLS-TP        February 2011


1.  Introduction

   As required in section 2.2.5 of [RFC5860], the MPLS-TP OAM toolset
   MUST provide a function to enable conducting diagnostic tests on a
   PW, LSP or Section, this function SHOULD be performed on-demand and
   one example of such diagnostic test consists in estimating the
   available bandwidth of e.g., an LSP.

   To make this requirement clearer and provide more details, this sub-
   function of diagnostic tests is specified as "throughput estimation"
   in section 6.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework], throughput
   estimation is an on-demand out-of-service function, that allows
   verifying the bandwidth/throughput of an MPLS-TP transport path (LSP
   or PW) before it is put in-service.  Throughput estimation is
   performed between MEPs and can be performed in one-way or two-way
   mode.

   This document specifies the OAM packets and procedures for both one-
   way and two-way throughput estimation/measurement in MPLS-TP.

2.  Overview

   In [RFC1242], the throughput is defined as a performance metric for
   network interconnection device, and it's defined by "the maximum rate
   at which none of the offered frames are dropped by the device".  In
   MPLS-TP context, the definition of throughput is applied to an
   MPLS-TP connection which could be an MPLS-TP LSP, PW or Section.

2.1.  Throughput Measurement Modes

   In [RFC2544], the throughput measurement procedures are specified as
   "send a specific number of frames at a specific rate through the DUT
   and then count the frames that are transmitted by the DUT.  If the
   count of offered frames is equal to the count of received frames, the
   fewer frames are received than were transmitted, the rate of the
   offered stream is reduced and the test is rerun.  The throughput is
   the fastest rate at which the count of test frames transmitted by the
   DUT is equal to the number of test frames sent to it by the test
   equipment".  But in current practical throughput measurement
   scenario, usually the throughput is measured by test equipment using
   the binary search algorithm, in this case also more than one run of
   test traffic sending may be needed and the run count can be used to
   indicate the times of test traffic sending.

   If the precision of throughput measurement is not cared much, in
   order to take advantage of the implementary simplicity, the
   measurement method similar to that indicated in [RFC2544] would be
   used and the throughput measurement is said to operate in "estimated
   mode".  On the other hand, if the precision of throughput measurement
   is cared much, in order to achieve more precision and efficiency, the
   measurement method newly introduced by this document would be used
   and the throughput measurement is said to operate in "measured mode".
   These methods are described in more detail in section 4.

2.2.  One-way Throughput Measurement

   One-way throughput measurement needs to be supported for both
   unidirectional and bidirectional MPLS-TP connection.  One-way
   throughput indicates the throughput for the forward direction of the
   connection from the initiator MEP, which initiates the process of
   throughput measurement and keep active in the whole process.

Internet-Draft        Thput Measurement for MPLS-TP        February 2011


   For one-way throughput measurement in estimated mode, the initiator
   MEP sends test traffic and the peer MEP calculates the test data
   packet loss, otherwise in measured mode, the initiator MEP controls
   the whole process of measurement and the peer MEP acts just as a
   responder.  Also note that for a unidirectional MPLS-TP connection
   (such as a unidirectional LSP) without return path, only the
   estimated mode should be used.

2.3.  Two-way Throughput Measurement

   Two-way throughput measurement needs to be supported for only
   bidirectional MPLS-TP connection.  Two-way throughput indicates both
   the throughput for the forward direction of the connection and the
   throughput for the reverse direction of the connection from the
   initiator MEP.

   For two-way throughput measurement in estimated mode, only the
   initiator MEP sends test traffic and the peer MEP loopbacks all
   received test data packets, otherwise in measured mode, both the
   initiator MEP and the peer MEP send test traffic, and the initiator
   MEP controls the whole process of measurement, just like one-way
   throughput measurement.  Also note that in estimated mode only the
   minimum of available throughput of the two directions would return,
   otherwise in measured mode, two individual available throughputs of
   the two directions can be achieved.


3.  Packet Format

   For throughput measurement in estimated mode, only the test data
   packets would be sent by the MEP, otherwise in measured mode, the
   specific packets sent by the MEP can be divided into control packets
   and test data packets.  The throughput measurement control packets
   flow over the Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) [RFC5586] of an
   MPLS-TP connection and perform signaling between the initiator MEP
   and the peer MEP, while the throughput measurement test data packets
   compose the test traffic which intends to emulate the real user
   traffic.

3.1.  Throughput Measurement Control Packet Format

   The format of a throughput measurement control packet is shown below.

            test data packets received by the local MEP (i.e. the MEP
            sending this control message) in this run.

3.2.  Throughput Measurement Test Data Packet Format

   Whether the throughput measurement is performed in estimated mode or
   measured mode, the format of a throughput measurement test data
   packet would be just the same.  In order to simplify the
   implementation of MPLS-TP OAM functions, the format of a throughput
   measurement test data packet should be aligned with the format of a
   data plane loopback test data packet, which is specified in section 5
   of [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-li-lb].  As indicated in section 3.1, four
   pattern types of throughput measurement test data packets can be
   constructed based on Padding field and optional CRC-32 field.


4.  Operation

   As specified in section 6.3.1.1 of [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework],
   before throughput measurement is initiated, the diagnosed MEG should
   be put into a Lock status, and an MEG can be put into a Lock status
   either via NMS action or using the Lock Instruct OAM tool which is
   specified in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-li-lb].

   It should be noted that in estimated mode, for different test data
   packet size, or test data packet pattern, or test data packet PHB, or
   step length of sending rate, or even sending duration of test
   traffic, different result of throughput measurement may be obtained,
   so all these parameters need to be configurable for throughput
   measurement in estimated mode.  Also note that in measured mode, for
   different test data packet size, or test data packet pattern, or test
   data packet PHB, or expected measurement resolution, or even sending
   duration of test traffic, different result of throughput measurement
   may be obtained, so all these parameters need to be configurable for
   throughput measurement in measured mode.  Besides, optional
   acceptable frame loss rate would be provisioned in measured mode if
   needed.  Also note that the set of PHB value of control packets would
   follow the provisioned test data packet PHB.

4.1.  Throughput Measurement Procedures in Estimated Mode

   For one-way throughput measurement, the initiator MEP sends test
   traffic with the provisioned initial sending rate for the first run,
   and then the peer MEP will calculate test data packet loss according
   to Sequence-Number field of test data packet.  If calculated Packet
   Loss (one-way) is equal to zero, then the operator will increase the
   sending rate with a fixed step length (e.g. 100 kb/s) manually and
   command the initiator MEP to send test traffic with the increased
   sending rate for rerun.  On the analogy of this, the initiator MEP
   will gradually increase its sending rate until the calculated Packet
   Loss (one-way) is not equal to zero for a certain run, and the
   sending rate for the last run is the measured one-way throughput.

   For two-way throughput measurement, the peer MEP should be put into a
   Loopback status, and this can be achieved either via NMS action or
   using the Data Plane Loopback OAM tool which is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-li-lb].  The initiator MEP sends test traffic with
   the provisioned initial sending rate for the first run, and the peer
   MEP loops all received test data packets back, and then the initiator
   MEP itself will calculate test data packet loss by comparing the sent
   and received test data packets.  If calculated Packet Loss (two-way)
   is equal to zero, then the sending rate will be increased with a
   fixed step length (e.g. 100kb/s) automatically and the initiator MEP
   will send test traffic with the increased sending rate for rerun.  On
   the analogy of this, the initiator MEP will gradually increase its
   sending rate until the calculated Packet Loss (two-way) is not equal
   to zero for a certain run, and the sending rate for the last run is
   the measured two-way throughput.

4.2.  Throughput Measurement Procedures in Measured Mode

4.2.1.  Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Start Request

   After initiating a throughput measurement operation, the initiator
   MEP will at first transmit a throughput measurement Start Request to
   the peer MEP.  Also note that for every rerun of sending test
   traffic, the initiator MEP would also transmit this message as
   beginning.

   For one-way throughput measurement, this message is intended to
   inform the peer MEP about the start of test traffic sending and
   trigger the peer MEP to start counting test data packets.  For two-
   way throughput measurement, except for the same intention as one-way
   throughput measurement, this message is further intended to convey
   necessary test parameters to the peer MEP and trigger the peer MEP to
   send test traffic too, and note that for rerun only Run Count and
   Sending Rate in this message would be changed while other parameters



Xiao, et al.             Expires August 29, 2011               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft        Thput Measurement for MPLS-TP        February 2011


   retain initial values.  Also note that for both one-way and two-way
   measurement, the initiator MEP would start counting test data packets
   as soon as it transmits this message.

4.2.2.  Receiving a Throughput Measurement Start Request

   Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Start Request, the
   peer MEP must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected field
   or value is found then the peer MEP should start counting test data
   packets.  In addition, if the received W-flag indicates that this is
   a two-way throughput measurement, then the peer MEP should also start
   sending test traffic after it starts counting test data packets.

4.2.3.  Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Start Reply

   After receiving a throughput measurement Start Request, the peer MEP
   must transmit a throughput measurement Start Reply to the initiator
   MEP.  The Control Code in Start Reply Message should be set to 0x0 to
   reflect the successful operation at the peer MEP, or on the contrary
   set to 0x1 to reflect the failed operation at the peer MEP.  Except
   the R-flag and Control Code field, other fields of Start Reply
   Message will be copied from the received Start Request Message.

4.2.4.  Receiving a Throughput Measurement Start Reply

   Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Start Reply, the
   initiator MEP must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected
   field or value is found, and the received Control Code indicates
   successful operation at the peer MEP, then the initiator MEP should
   start sending test traffic.  If unexpected field or value is found
   while inspecting this message, or the received Control Code indicates
   failed operation at the peer MEP, or there is no any throughput
   measurement Start Reply received after a while (such as 1 second),
   then specific error should be returned at the initiator MEP and no
   test traffic will be sent from the initiator MEP.

4.2.5.  Sending and Receiving Test Traffic

   From above procedures it can be seen that for two-way throughput
   measurement the pair of MEPs will send test traffic asynchronously,
   and the peer MEP will start/stop sending test traffic some earlier
   than the initiator MEP, but the asynchronism has no side-effect on
   the measurement result because both MEPs shall start counting test
   data packets before they send/receive any test traffic.

   Also note that when the initiator MEP sends test traffic, for the
   first run the test parameters are all derived from the provisions,
   and for the rerun only the sending rate is changed and derived from



Xiao, et al.             Expires August 29, 2011               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        Thput Measurement for MPLS-TP        February 2011


   the local calculation.  When the peer MEP sends test traffic, for
   every run the test parameters are all derived from the received Start
   Request Message.

4.2.6.  Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Stop Request

   For every run, after the initiator MEP finish sending test traffic,
   it will transmit a throughput measurement Stop Request to the peer
   MEP.  This message is intended to inform the peer MEP about the stop
   of test traffic sending at the initiator MEP, which trigger the peer
   MEP to stop counting test data packets and feed back the counters.

4.2.7.  Receiving a Throughput Measurement Stop Request

   Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Stop Request, the peer
   MEP must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected field or
   value is found then the peer MEP should stop counting test data
   packets.  Also note that for two-way throughput measurement, as
   indicated in section 4.2.5, the peer MEP has stopped sending test
   traffic before it receives a throughput measurement Stop Request.

4.2.8.  Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Stop Reply

   After receiving a throughput measurement Stop Request, the peer MEP
   must transmit a throughput measurement Stop Reply to the initiator
   MEP.  The Control Code in Stop Reply Message should be set to 0x0 to
   reflect the successful operation at the peer MEP, or on the contrary
   set to 0x1 to reflect the failed operation at the peer MEP.  The Tx
   Counter and Rx Counter in Stop Reply Message are set to the test data
   packet counting values at the peer MEP.

4.2.9.  Receiving a Throughput Measurement Stop Reply

   Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Stop Reply, the
   initiator MEP must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected
   field or value is found, and the received Control Code indicates
   successful operation at the peer MEP, then the initiator MEP should
   stop counting test data packets and start calculating the test data
   packet loss.  Suppose the Tx Counter and Rx Counter locally are TxP1
   and RxP1 for the initiator MEP, and in Stop Reply Message are TxP2
   and RxP2 for the peer MEP.

   For one-way throughput measurement, the calculation formula is as
   follow:

   Packet Loss (one-way) = TxP1 - RxP2

   For two-way throughput measurement, the calculation formulas are as



Xiao, et al.             Expires August 29, 2011               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        Thput Measurement for MPLS-TP        February 2011


   follow:

   Packet Loss (forward) = TxP1 - RxP2

   Packet Loss (reverse) = TxP2 - RxP1

   If unexpected field or value is found while inspecting this message,
   or the received Control Code indicates failed operation at the peer
   MEP, or there is no any throughput measurement Stop Reply received
   after a while (such as 1 second), then specific error should be
   returned at the initiator MEP and no calculation for test data packet
   loss will be executed.

4.2.10.  Consequent Actions and Searching Algorithm

   Procedures for one run of test traffic sending and test data packet
   loss calculation have been described above in details, but usually
   iterative reruns of the procedures are needed for a throughput
   measurement.  Whether the rerun is needed or not is based on both the
   calculated test data packet loss and whether the expected measurement
   resolution is met.  For one-way throughput measurement, if calculated
   Packet Loss (one-way) is equal to zero and the expected measurement
   resolution is met, then rerun is not needed (i.e. the one-way
   throughput measurement finished) and the current sending rate is the
   measured one-way throughput, otherwise the one-way throughput
   measurement proceeds.  For two-way throughput measurement, if
   calculated Packet Loss (forward) and Packet Loss (reverse) are both
   equal to zero, and the expected measurement resolution for both
   forward and reverse directions is met, then rerun is not needed (i.e.
   the two-way throughput measurement finished) and the current sending
   rate for forward/reverse direction is the measured forward/reverse
   throughput, otherwise the two-way throughput measurement proceeds,
   and in this case the sending rates for rerun should be calculated for
   forward direction and reverse direction respectively.

   The simple and efficient binary search algorithm is applied to
   calculate the sending rate for the next run, which is the only
   changed test parameter compared with this run.  How the binary search
   works, if packet loss is found for this run, it searches downwards
   for a lower rate which is halfway rate between the rate of this run
   and the known highest rate at which no packet loss is found; if no
   packet loss is found but the expected measurement resolution is not
   met for this run, it searches upwards for a higher rate which is
   halfway rate between the rate of this run and the known lowest rate
   at which packet loss is found; the measurement searches among higher
   and lower rates on the analogy of this, until it finds the rate at
   which no test data packet is lost and expected measurement resolution
   is met, and this rate is the measured throughput.  How to judge



Xiao, et al.             Expires August 29, 2011               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        Thput Measurement for MPLS-TP        February 2011


   whether the expected measurement resolution is met or not, if the
   rate difference between the two consecutive runs (i.e. this run and
   the previous run), expressed as a percentage, is smaller than or
   equal to the specified measurement resolution, it's known as that the
   expected measurement resolution is met, otherwise it's not met.

   For example, suppose to measure the throughput of a connection whose
   actual throughput is 70Mbps, the provisioned initial sending rate is
   100Mbps and the specified measurement resolution is 0.1.  Note that
   the initial sending rate should be higher than the actual throughput,
   otherwise the binary search is not applicable, and so it's often set
   to the maximum theoretical throughput of the measured connection.
   For the first run, packet loss is found, so for the second run, the
   sending rate will be calculated as (100+0)/2 = 50Mbps, no packet loss
   is found, then the resolution will be calculated as (100-50)/50 = 1,
   which is bigger than 0.1, the expected measurement resolution is not
   met, so for the third run, the sending rate will be calculated as
   (100+50)/2 = 75Mbps, packet loss is found, so for the fourth run, the
   sending rate will be calculated as (50+75)/2 = 62.5Mbps, no packet
   loss is found, then the resolution will be calculated as (75-62.5)/
   62.5 = 0.2, which is bigger than 0.1, the expected measurement
   resolution is not met, so for the fifth run, the sending rate will be
   calculated as (75+62.5)/2 = 68.75Mbps, no packet loss is found, then
   the resolution will be calculated as (68.75-62.5)/68.75 = 0.09, which
   is smaller than 0.1, the expected measurement resolution is met, so
   the measurement finished and the rate 68.75Mbps is the measured
   throughput.

   As indicated in front of this section, a threshold on the acceptable
   frame loss rate MAY be set before throughput measurement, in this
   case it's not required that absolutely no packet loss exists, and the
   pre-provisioned acceptable frame loss rate needs to be taken into
   account when judging whether the throughput is got after every run.


5.  Throughput Measurement Time

   The throughput measurement time is about the product of sending
   duration for one run and number of all run times.  The sending
   duration for one run is provisioned before the throughput measurement
   starts, and the number of all run times is related to several factors
   which include the provisioned initial sending rate, the applied
   searching algorithm and the specified expected measurement
   resolution.  Obviously longer sending duration would result in more
   precise measured result, but then longer throughput measurement time
   is needed, so there should be a balance between them.  On the other
   hand, for throughput measurement in estimated mode, the shorter step
   length and the shorter measurement time are mutually exclusive,



Xiao, et al.             Expires August 29, 2011               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft        Thput Measurement for MPLS-TP        February 2011


   similarly in measured mode, the higher measurement resolution and the
   shorter measurement time are mutually exclusive, and so the balance
   between them is also needed.
