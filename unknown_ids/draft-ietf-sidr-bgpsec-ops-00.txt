Internet-Draft      BGPsec Operational Considerations          June 2011


1.  Introduction

   BGPsec is a new protocol with many operational considerations.  It is
   expected to be deployed incrementally over a number of years.  As
   core BGPsec-capable routers may require large memory and crypto
   assist, it is thought that origin validation based on the RPKI will
   occur over the next two to five years and that BGPsec will start to
   deploy late in that window.

   BGPsec relies on widespread propagation of the Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI) [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch].  How the RPKI is
   distributed and maintained globally and within an operator's
   infrastructure may be different for BGPsec than for origin
   validation.

   BGPsec need be spoken only by a AS's eBGP speaking, AKA border,
   routers, and is designed so that it can be used to protect
   announcements which are originated by small edge routers, and this
   has special operational considerations.

   Different prefixes have different timing and replay protection
   considerations.


2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, [RFC4271], BGPsec,
   [I-D.lepinski-bgpsec-overview], the RPKI, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch],
   the RPKI Repository Structure, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-repos-struct], and
   ROAs, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-format].


3.  RPKI Distribution and Maintenance

   The RPKI is a distributed database containing certificates, CRLs,
   manifests, ROAs, and Ghostbuster Records as described in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-repos-struct].  Policies and considerations for RPKI
   object generation and maintenance are discussed elsewhere.

   A local valid cache containing all RPKI data may be gathered from the
   global distributed database using the rsync protocol and a validation
   tool such as rcynic.

   Validated caches may also be created and maintained from other
   validated caches.  Network operators SHOULD take maximum advantage of
   this feature to minimize load on the global distributed RPKI
   database.

Internet-Draft      BGPsec Operational Considerations          June 2011


   As RPKI-based origin validation relies on the availability of RPKI
   data, operators SHOULD locate caches close to routers that require
   these data and services.  A router can peer with one or more nearby
   caches.

   For redundancy, a router SHOULD peer with more than one cache at the
   same time.  Peering with two or more, at least one local and others
   remote, is recommended.

   If an operator trusts upstreams to carry their traffic, they SHOULD
   also trust the RPKI data those upstreams cache, and SHOULD peer with
   those caches.  Note that this places an obligation on those upstreams
   to maintain fresh and reliable caches.

   A transit provider or a network with peers SHOULD validate NLRI in
   announcements made by upstreams, downstreams, and peers.  They still
   SHOULD trust the caches provided by their upstreams.

   An environment where private address space is announced in eBGP the
   operator MAY have private RPKI objects which cover these private
   spaces.  This will require a trust anchor created and owned by that
   environment, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-ltamgmt].


4.  AS/Router Certificates

   A site/operator MAY use a single certificate/key in all their
   routers, one certificate/key per router, or any granularity in
   between.

   A large operator, concerned that a compromise of one router's key
   would make many routers vulnerable, MAY accept a more complex
   certificate/key distribution burden to reduce this exposure.

   On the other extreme, an edge site with one or two routers MAY use a
   single certificate/key.

   Routers MAY be capable of generating their own keys and having their
   certificates signed and published in the RPKI by their NOC.  This
   would mean that a router's private key need never leave the router.


5.  Within a Network

   BGPsec is spoken by edge routers in a network, those which border
   other networks/ASs.

   In a fully BGPsec enabled AS, Route Reflectors MUST have BGPsec



Bush                    Expires December 30, 2011               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      BGPsec Operational Considerations          June 2011


   enabled if and only if there are eBGP speakers in their client cone.

   A BGPsec capable router MAY use the data it receives to influence
   local policy within its network, see Section 8.  In deployment this
   policy should fit into the AS's existing policy, preferences, etc.
   This allows a network to incrementally deploy BGPsec capable border
   routers.

   eBGP speakers which face more critical peers or up/downstreams would
   be candidates for the earliest deployment.  Both securing one's own
   announcements and validating received announcements should be
   considered in partial deployment.

   An eBGP listener MUST NOT trust non-BGPsec markings such as
   communities received across a trust boundary.


6.  Considerations for Edge Sites

   An edge site which does not provide transit and trusts its
   upstream(s) SHOULD only originate a signed prefix announcement and
   need not validate received announcements.

   BGPsec protocol capability negotiation provides for a speaker signing
   the data it sends but being unable to accept signed data.  Thus a
   smallish edge router may hold only its own signing key(s) and sign
   it's announcement but not receive signed announcements and therefore
   not need to deal with the majority of the RPKI.

   As the vast majority (84%) of ASs are stubs, and they announce the
   majority of prefixes, this allows for simpler and cheaper early
   incremental deployment.  It may also mean that edge sites concerned
   with routing security will be attracted to upstreams which support
   BGPsec.


7.  Beaconing Considerations

   The BGPsec protocol attempts to reduce exposure to replay attacks by
   allowing the route originator to sign an announcement with a validity
   period and re-announce well within that period.

   This re-announcement is termed 'beaconing'.  All timing values are,
   of course, jittered.

   It is only the originator of an NLRI which signs the announcement
   with a validity period.

Internet-Draft      BGPsec Operational Considerations          June 2011


   To reduce vulnerability to a lost beacon announcement, a router
   SHOULD beacon at a rate somewhat greater than half the signature
   validity period it uses.

   As beaconing places a load on the entire global routing system,
   careful thought MUST be given to any need to beacon frequently.  This
   would be based on a conservative estimation of the vulnerability to a
   replay attack.

   Beacon timing and signature validity periods SHOULD be as follows:

   The Exemplary Citizen:  Prefix originators who are not overly
      concerned about replay attacks might announce with a signature
      validity of multiple weeks and beacon one third of the validity
      period.

   Normal Prefix:  Most prefixes SHOULD announce with a signature
      validity of a week and beacon every three days.

   Critical Prefix:  Of course, we all think what we do is critical.
      But prefixes of top level DNS servers, and RPKI publication points
      are actually critical to large swaths of the Internet and are
      therefore tempting targets for replay attacks.  It is suggested
      that the beaconing of these prefixes SHOULD be two to four hours,
      with a signature validity of six to twelve hours.

      Note that this may incur route flap damping (RFD) with current
      default but deprecated RFD parameters, see [I-D.ymbk-rfd-usable].


8.  Routing Policy

   Unlike origin validation based on the RPKI, BGPsec marks a received
   announcement as Valid or Invalid, there is no NotFound state.  How
   this is used in routing is up to the operator's local policy.  See
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-pfx-validate].

   As BGPsec will be rolled out over years and does not allow for
   intermediate non-signing edge routers, coverage will be spotty for a
   long time.  Hence a normal operator's policy SHOULD NOT be overly
   strict, perhaps preferring valid announcements and giving very low
   preference, but still using, invalid announcements.

   A BGPsec speaker validates signed paths at the eBGP edge.

   Local policy on the eBGP edge MAY convey the validation state of a
   BGP signed path through normal local policy mechanisms, e.g. setting
   a BGP community, or modifying a metric value such as local-preference

   or MED.  Some MAY choose to use the large Local-Pref hammer.  Others
   MAY choose to let AS-Path rule and set their internal metric, which
   comes after AS-Path in the BGP decision process.

   Because of possible RPKI version skew, an AS Path which does not
   validate at router R0 might validate at R1.  Therefore, signed paths
   that are invalid and yet propagated SHOULD have their signatures kept
   intact and should be signed if sent to external BGPsec speakers.

   This implies that updates which a speaker judges to be invalid MAY be
   propagated to iBGP peers.  Therefore, unless local policy ensures
   otherwise, a signed path learned via iBGP MAY be invalid.  If needed,
   the validation state SHOULD be signaled by normal local policy
   mechanisms such as communities or metrics.

   On the other hand, local policy on the eBGP edge might preclude iBGP
   or eBGP announcement of signed AS Paths which are invalid.

   If a BGPsec speaker receives an unsigned path, it SHOULD perform
   origin validation per [I-D.ietf-sidr-pfx-validate].


9.  Notes

   Like the DNS, the global RPKI presents only a loosely consistent
   view, depending on timing, updating, fetching, etc.  Thus, one cache
   or router may have different data about a particular prefix than
   another cache or router.  There is no 'fix' for this, it is the
   nature of distributed data with distributed caches.

   Operators who manage certificates SHOULD have RPKI Ghostbuster
   Records (see [I-D.ietf-sidr-ghostbusters]), signed indirectly by End
   Entity certificates, for those certificates on which others' routing
   depends for certificate and/or ROA validation.

   As a router must evaluate certificates and ROAs which are time
   dependent, routers' clocks MUST be correct to a tolerance of
   approximately an hour.

   If a router has reason to believe its clock is seriouly incorrect,
   e.g. it has a time earlier than 2011, it SHOULD NOT attempt to
   validate incoming updates.  It SHOULD defer validation until it
   believes it is within reasonable time tolerance.

   Servers should provide time service, such as NTP [RFC5905], to client
   routers.
