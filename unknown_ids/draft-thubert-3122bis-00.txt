Internet-Draft                 RFC3122bis                   October 2008


1.  Introduction

   This draft updates the Inverse Neighbor Discovery  Specification
   [RFC3122].  Any behaviour or format that is not explicitely changed
   is preserved.

   The behaviour of the protocol is slightly amended :

   o  Secure Inverse Neighbor Discovery is added for unicast addresses
      with a 64bit interface ID.  This specification provides the
      additional options that are required to sign Inverse ND messages
      with the properties that are defined in [RFC3971] and details how
      they may be used to prove the ownership of advertised addresses.

   o  Fragmentation of ND messages is accepted but not required.
      [RFC3122] requires the use of multiple Advertisement messages when
      the Target Address List does not fit within MTU.  With this
      specification, it is acceptable to fragment a message, but it is
      still possible to use multiple Advertisement messages, which can
      be necessary in particular in the context of Secure Inverse
      Neighbor Discovery.

   o  [RFC3122] does not allow a crisp management of all Addresses that
      a peer may use on an interface.  When multiple Advertisement
      messages are used, it is possible to miss one and thus miss some
      information.  With this specification, Address Management is
      improved in such a way that it is possible to advertise the
      addition or the deletion of a single address and to get the
      exhaustive list of all the addresses that a neighbor might use to
      source packets on an interface.

   o  With IPv4, Inverse ARP is traditionally applied to Point to
      Multipoint networks only.  [RFC3122] claims to apply to "Frame
      Relay networks", and "also apply to other networks with similar
      behavior".  This specification extends the domain of applicability
      of Inverse Neighbor Discovery and provides some additional
      information on how and why Inverse ND MAY be used on all types of
      interface.

   o  Typos such as the length field in the Source/Target Address List
      are corrected.

   The concept of transaction is introduced to group multiple messages
   into a single set to enable the advertisement of the complete list of
   all addresses used to source packets on on an interface.  Whenever
   possible, a node should use one message per transaction.

   This is problematic when:

Internet-Draft                 RFC3122bis                   October 2008


   o  The list of addresses is so large that it causes the message to be
      larger than MTU and the node can not fragment.

   o  Secure Inverse ND is applied and not all of the addresses are
      based on a same CGA modifier (see [RFC3972]).

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Inverse Neighbor Discovery Messages

   This section updates the Inverse Neighbor Discovery Messages defined
   in [RFC3122] section 2.

   A new field from the ICMP reserved part is used to indicate the
   version and preserve backward compatibility.  Version 0 is [RFC3122].
   Version 1 is this specification.  A node proposes a version in the
   Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation Message and responds with the
   smallest of its own preferred version and the received proposed
   version in an Advertisement.

   Another new field from the ICMP reserved part is used to indicate the
   Transaction ID of a Neighbor Discovery Solicitation Message, in order
   to correlate multiple Advertisement messages that may result from one
   Solicitation Message.  A sequence number and a 'more' flag are also
   added to enable the soliciting node to check that it actually
   received all the Advertisement messages for a given Transaction ID.

2.1.  Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation Message

   The Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation Message can be used to
   obtain the full list of IPv6 addresses from the remote end of a Point
   to Point link such as a PPP link, a tunnel or a Virtual Channel.

   The Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation can also be used as a
   heartbeat mechanism to verify whether a Point to Point link such as a
   tunnel is still up when there is no signal from the lower layers to
   indicate a failure.

   The Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation Message is changed as
   follows:

      |   Options ...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-



         Modified Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation Message

   This specification adds the following fields:

   Version:  8bit field.  Version of 0 indicates the support of
      [RFC3122] only.  Version of 1 indicates the desire to follow this
      specification and the backward compatibility with version 0.

   Transaction ID:  8bit field.  The Transaction ID is incremented with
      each Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation Message sent to the
      same neighbor.  The transaction ID can not be set to zero so it
      starts at 1 and wraps from 255 directly to 1.

   F: 1bit field.  The "F" flag indicates a request of the Full List of
      addresses on the peer side of the Link.

2.2.  Inverse Neighbor Discovery Advertisement Message

   The Inverse Neighbor Discovery Advertisement Message can be used as a
   response to an Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation Message or
   asynchronously at any point of time once a first Inverse Neighbor
   Discovery Solicitation Message was received indicating that the
   remote peer supports this specification.

   Multiple Inverse Neighbor Discovery Advertisement Messages might be
   needed to report the full list of addresses.  Those messages are
   correlated by a same transaction ID and sequenced.  All Messages but
   the last have the More bit set to indicate that further Messages are
   to be expected for that transaction.

   An unsolicited Advertisement is used to advertise the addition or the
   deletion of a single address and is contained in a single Inverse
   Neighbor Discovery Advertisement Message, with a transaction ID of 0.

   The Inverse Neighbor Discovery Advertisement Message is changed as
   follows:

      |   Options ...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-



         Modified Inverse Neighbor Discovery Advertisement Message

   This specification adds the following fields:

   Sequence:  8bit field.  The sequence echoes that of the last received
      Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation Message.

   Version:  8bit field.  Version of 0 indicates the support of
      [RFC3122] only.  Version of 1 indicates the desire to follow this
      specification.  Version can only be set to 1 if the Version in the
      Solicitation Message was 1 or above.

   Transaction ID:  8bit field.  The Transaction ID echoes that of the
      Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation Message that this Message
      is responding to.  The transaction ID zero is used for unsolicited
      Advertisements.

   Sequence:  8bit field.  The sequence is reset to zero for a new
      transaction ID and incremented with each Advertisement Message
      sent to a same Neighbor for a same Transaction ID.  It is used to
      detect the loss of one Inverse Neighbor Discovery Advertisement
      Message in a Transaction that involved multiple ones.

   M: 1bit field.  The More "M" flag indicates that there are more
      messages for that transaction ID.

   F: 1bit field.  The "F" flag indicates that the Full List of
      addresses will be provided for that transaction.

   Upon a request by the remote peer of the Full List of addresses, this
   node SHOULD answer with all the addresses that can be used to reach
   it over this link in the modified Target Address List.

   If the IND Solicitation does not request the full list then his node
   MAY answer with all the addresses that can be used to reach it over
   this link in the modified Target Address List.

3.  Inverse Neighbor Discovery Options

   This section updates the Inverse Neighbor Discovery Options defined
   in [RFC3122] section 3.

3.1.  Source/Target Address List

   With this specification, the Source/Target Address List may be
   partial or full.  It can be used to indicate addition or deletion of
   indivisual addresses.  This new support can only be used once the
   first Inverse Neighbor Discovery Solicitation Message is received
   from the remote peer indicating the support of this specification.

   Until the Version that is supported by the peer is known, the only
   Inverse Neighbor Discovery Messages that this node should send are
   Solicitations, and this option if present can only be a Source
   Address List option with a list of addresses that can be used to
   reach this node over this link.

   This specification uses a Length field of 8 bits, assuming that most
   implementations of [RFC3122] also use a Length field of 8 bits and
   that the misalignment in section 3.1 is commonly undestood as an
   undetected typo.  An error in reading the Length field can be
   detected when confronting the length of the IPv6 packet and the
   expected length of this option.

   The Inverse Neighbor Discovery Advertisement Message is changed as
   follows:

                Modified Source/Target Address List option

   This specification adds the following fields:

   Mode  8bit enumeration

      RFC3122:  Mode of 0 indicates that the list is built conforming to
         [RFC3122].  All the addresses listed are usable but the list
         might not be complete.

      Full:  Mode of 1 indicates that the list might contain addresses
         that are defined on another interface but may be used to source
         or receive packets over this interface.  This is the mode that
         is used to in reply to a Solicitation with the "F" bit set.

Internet-Draft                 RFC3122bis                   October 2008


      Added:  Mode of 2 indicates that the list is a list of recently
         added addresses but not necessarily part of a full report.

      Deleted:  Mode of 3 indicates that the list is a list of recently
         removed addresses that may no more be used on this link.

   Upon receiving an Address List, a node should verify that the
   addresses in the list don't collide with any of its own address.  In
   case it does, the duplicate address received in the list will be
   ignored.

   When Secure IND is being used, all the addresses listed in the Target
   Address List option in one Inverse Neighbor Discovery Advertisement
   Message must be based on the same CGA modifier.  If multiple
   modifiers are used or some addresses were not built based on CGA,
   then they must be split in multiple Inverse Neighbor Discovery
   Advertisement Messages.


4.  Secure Inverse Neighbor Discovery

   The list of addresses provided in Source/Target address list can be
   defended using the CGA and the RSA options specified in [RFC3972] and
   [RFC3971].  However, in the case of Secure Inverse Neighbor
   Discovery, several addresses announced in one message (IND
   Solicitation or Advertisement) are defended by a single CGA option
   and a single RSA option.  That mandates that all addresses in the
   list are based on CGA and were computed with the same modifier, the
   same collision count, and the same security parameter sec.  In this
   case, the CGA option is as following:

   Since each address in the list is going to carry its own prefix (/64
   if CGA is used), the Subnet Prefix in the CGA option is set to zero.
   Therefore, it should not be checked by the receiver against the
   prefix (/64 bits) of each CGA address found in the Address List.

   The collision count is always zero, since no Duplicate Address
   Detection is performed, other than the node ignoring peer addresses
   colliding with one of its own.

   The remaining of the CGA algorithm, as described in [RFC3972]
   applies.  The 16*Sec leftmost bits of Hash2 should equal zero.  Hash1
   is computed separately for each address in the list, using the first
   64 bits as the Subnet Prefix, and the interface identifier should
   match Hash1 (except for bits 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7, which encode the
   collision count and the "u" and "g" bits).

   The RSA option must also be provided in the message, and the
   signature must verify with the public key provided in the CGA option

   In order to protect against replays, Timestamp and Nonce options,
   should also be used in the message, with similar rules as one
   described in [RFC3971].  When the message is a solicitation (INS), it

   should have a nonce option.  When the message is sollicited (INA as a
   response to INS), it should repeat the nonce value seen in the
   solicitation.  As far as unsolicited message and solicitation, the
   timestamp option is required.


5.  Interface Type and usages

   Because of IPv4 and the ARP legacy, Inverse Neighbor Discovery is
   usually associated to Point to Multipoint (P2MP) or Non-Broadcast
   Multi-Access (NBMA) networks.  And certainly, this specification is
   usable on such networks as Frame Relay or Multidrop tunnels.

   But the similarity with IPv4 is limited and this specification
   enables a lot more:

5.1.  Point to Multipoint Networks

   IPv6 Secure Inverse Neighbor Discovery can be applied to P2MP and
   NBMA networks to prevent the theft an address by another Node.

5.2.  Point-to-Point Links

   As opposed to IPv4, using Inverse Neighbor Discovery makes a lot of
   sense on Point-to-Point link such as PPP or tunnels:

   This specification inherits from [RFC3122] the support of the
   authentication header to authenticate the remote peer on the link.
   For P2P links, this might prove more relevant than Secure ND itself.

   Because IPv6 operates purely at layer 3, the PPP Network Control
   Protocol for IPv6 defined in [RFC5072] provides a way to negotiate a
   unique, 64bit interface identifier to be used for the address
   autoconfiguration but does not enable to advertise an IPv6 address.
   This would not fit anyway since IPv6 might use many addresses of
   various lifetimes on a same interface.  This specification provides
   the means to create and maintain the list of addresses that can be
   used to reach the remote peer at any point of time.

   A number of Denial of Service attacks are documented when using
   [RFC4861] by sending packets to addresses that are not assigned but
   belong to a prefix that is associated to the P2P link.  On those
   links, Inverse Neighbor Discovery enables a proactive model that
   defeats those attacks.  Any packet that is received for a destination
   that is not in the ND table is simply dropped.

5.3.  Broadcast Networks

   A multihomed host attached to a broadcast network might use an
   address that belongs to another interface on another subnet to source
   a packet.  This makes the validation of source addresses very
   problematic.  With this specification, a router may solicit the full
   list of all addreses that this host might use to source packets on
   that interface, and prove the ownership using SeND.  The router might
   then accept packets that are sourced off-link and may install a host
   route to that address.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   This draft improves the security model in [RFC3122] by adding the
   capability to use Secure Neighbor Discovery
