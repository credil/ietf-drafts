Internet-Draft            RTCP XR Jitter Buffer            February 2009


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Jitter Buffer Metrics Block

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The new block type provides information on jitter buffer
   configuration and performance.

   The metric belongs to the class of transport-related terminal metrics
   defined in [MONARCH] (work in progress).

   Instances of this Metrics Block refer by tag to the separate
   auxiliary Measurement Identity block [MEASIDENT] which contains
   information such as the SSRC of the measured stream, and RTP sequence
   numbers and time intervals indicating the span of the report.

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This draft defines a new Extended Report block that
   MUST be used as defined in [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [PMOLFRAME] provides guidance on
   the definition and specification of performance metrics.  Metrics
   described in this draft either reference external definitions or
   define metrics generally in accordance with the guidelines in
   [PMOLFRAME].

1.4.  Applicability

   These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications.

2.  Jitter Buffer Metrics Block

   This block describes the configuration and operating parameters of
   the jitter buffer in the receiver of the RTP end system or RTP mixer
   which sends the report.

2.2.  Definition of Fields in Jitter Buffer Metrics Block

   block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Jitter Buffer Metrics Report Block is identified by the constant
      NJB.

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NJB with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Jitter Buffer Metrics
      block is an Interval or a Cumulative report, that is, whether the
      reported values apply to the most recent measurement interval
      duration between successive metrics reports (I=1) (the Interval
      Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=0) (the Cumulative Duration).
      Numerical values for both these intervals are provided in the
      Measurement Identifier block referenced by the tag field below.

   Measurement Identifier association (tag): 3 bits

      This field is used to identify the Measurement Identifier block
      [MEASIDENT] which describes this measurement.  The relevant
      Measurement Identifier block has the same tag value as the Jitter
      Buffer Metrics block.  Note that there may be more than one

Internet-Draft            RTCP XR Jitter Buffer            February 2009


      Measurement Identifier block per RTCP packet.

   Jitter Buffer Configuration (jb cfg): 4 bits

      This field is used to identify the jitter buffer method in use at
      the receiver, according to the following code:


              bits 014-017
                    0 = Fixed jitter buffer
                    1 = Adaptive jitter buffer
                    Other values reserved

   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Jitter Buffer block, the block length is equal to 2.

   jitter buffer nominal delay (JB nominal): 16 bits

      This is the current nominal jitter buffer delay in milliseconds,
      which corresponds to the nominal jitter buffer delay for packets
      that arrive exactly on time.  This parameter MUST be provided for
      both fixed and adaptive jitter buffer implementations.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.



   jitter buffer maximum delay (JB maximum): 16 bits

      This is the current maximum jitter buffer delay in milliseconds
      which corresponds to the earliest arriving packet that would not
      be discarded.  In simple queue implementations this may correspond
      to the nominal size.  In adaptive jitter buffer implementations,
      this value may dynamically.  This parameter MUST be provided for
      both fixed and adaptive jitter buffer implementations.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.

   jitter buffer high water mark (JB high water mark): 16 bits

Internet-Draft            RTCP XR Jitter Buffer            February 2009


      This is the highest value of the jitter buffer nominal delay which
      occurred at any time during the reporting interval.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.

   jitter buffer low water mark (JB low water mark): 16 bits

      This is the lowest value of the jitter buffer nominal delay which
      occurred at any time during the reporting interval.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.

3.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

   (defined in [RFC3611])

   xr-format = xr-format / xr-jb-block

   xr-jb-block = "jitter-bfr"

4.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

4.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value NJB in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the "JB Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NJB with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

4.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "jitter-bfr" in the
   "RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry".

4.3.  Contact information for registrations

   The contact information for the registrations is:

5.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
