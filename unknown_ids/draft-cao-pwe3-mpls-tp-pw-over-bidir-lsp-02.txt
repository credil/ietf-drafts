Abstract 

   A bidirectional Pseudowire (PW) service currently uses two 
   unidirectional PWs each carried over a unidirectional LSP. Each end 
   point of a PW or segment of multi-segment PW (MS-PW) independently 
   selects the LSP to use to carry the PW for which it is the head end.  

   Some transport services may require that bidirectional PW traffic 
   follows the same paths through the network in both directions. 
   Therefore, PWs may be required to use LSP with congruent paths. 
   Bidirectional LSPs or co-routed associated unidirectional LSPs allow 
   this service to be provided. 

   This document specifies some extensions to LDP that allow both ends 
   of a PW (or segment of a MS-PW) to select and bind to the same 
   bidirectional LSP or use unidirectional LSPs with congruent paths.

Internet-Draft            PW to LSP Binding                 March 2011 
    

1. Introduction 

   Pseudo Wire (PW) Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) [RFC3985] is a 
   mechanism to emulate a number of layer 2 services, such as 
   Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame Relay or Ethernet. Such 
   services are emulated between two Attachment Circuits (ACs) and the 
   PW encapsulated layer 2 service payload is carried through Packet 
   Switching Network (PSN) tunnels between Provider Edges (PEs). Today 
   PWE3 generally uses two reverse unidirectional Label Distribution 
   Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036] or Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic 
   Engineering (RSVP-TE) [RFC3209] LSPs as PSN tunnels, and each of the 
   PEs selects and binds PSN tunnel independently. There is no 
   protocol-based provision to explicitly associate a PW with a 
   specific PSN tunnel. 

   For transport applications it has been identified that some 
   transport services may require bidirectional traffic to follow 
   congruent paths. When bidirectional LSPs are used as PSN tunnels, 
   this requirement can be fulfilled if both PEs of a specific/segment 
   PW select and bind to the same bidirectional LSPs. In the case of 
   unidirectional LSPs, LSPs with congruent paths need to be selected 
   to support the PW. However, current mechanisms cannot guarantee 
   appropriate mapping of PWs to underlying LSPs. When there are 
   multiple unidirectional/bidirectional LSPs that may be used to 
   provide different levels of Quality of Service (QOS) or protection 
   between the PEs a selection must be made and some form of control is 
   required to ensure that the correct LSPs are used.

                      Figure 1  SS-PW scenario 

   Figure 1 shows an example of inconsistent binding in a Single-
   Segment PW (SS-PW) scenario. There are two bidirectional LSPs (LSP1 
   and LSP2, along diverse paths) and a bidirectional PW service 
   between PE1 and PE2. With the current mechanisms, it's possible that 
   PE1 may select LSP1 (PE1-P1-P2-PE2) as the PSN tunnel for the PE1-
   >PE2 direction of the PW, and PE2 may select LSP2 (PE1-P3-PE2) as 
   the PSN tunnel for the PE2->PE1 direction of the PW, so the 
   bidirectional PW service is bound to two separate bidirectional LSPs. 
   If the service requirement is that the two directions of the PW

   service are routed in the same way through the network, this outcome 
   will be unacceptable. The problem also exists in Multi-Segment PW 
   (MS-PW) scenarios. 

   One possible way to resolve this issue is to bind the PSN tunnel 
   manually at each PE, but this is prone to configuration errors and 
   it is difficult to maintain a large number of PWs in such a manner. 
   To allow for minimal manual intervention and configuration, this 
   draft discusses an automatic solution by extending FEC 128/129 PW 
   based on [RFC4447]. 

2. PW to LSP Binding TLV 

   In this document two new OPTIONAL TLVs are defined: the IPv4/IPv6 PW 
   to LSP Binding TLVs. They are used to communicate the selected LSPs 
   between the two PEs of a PW or segment of MS-PW. 

   When using LDP to signal the PW, the identifiers of the LSP are 
   carried in the Label Mapping message utilizing the new TLVs defined 
   in this document.  

   The format of the PW to LSP Binding LSP TLVs is as follows, the 
   value fields are derived from the definition of [TP-ID].

                 Figure3 IPv6 PW to LSP Binding TLV format 

   As defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473], an RSVP-TE LSP is identified 
   by the combination of LSP ID, Tunnel ID, Tunnel Extended ID, Tunnel 
   end point address, Tunnel sender address, and a mapping between 
   these fields to the fields of IPv4/v6 PW to LSP Binding TLV is 
   needed. The mapping defined in Section 5.3 of [TP-ID] applies here. 
   In addition, this document allows the Node ID can be either IPv4 or 
   IPv6 address. The IPv6 address based Node ID applies in the scenario 
   where the Tunnel end point address and Tunnel sender address is IPv6 
   address. 

   For co-routed bidirectional LSP, West Tunnel Number and LSP Number 
   MUST be set to the same as the East Tunnel Number and East LSP 
   Number, respectively. 

   For associated bidirectional LSP, East Tunnel Number and LSP Number 
   MUST be set to the Tunnel ID and LSP ID of the LSP from East to West, 
   respectively; West Tunnel Number and LSP Number MUST be set to the 
   Tunnel ID and LSP ID of LSP from West to East, respectively. 

   For unidirectional LSPs, when the reverse direction tunnel LSP can 
   be determined in advance (e.g., in an active/passive mode, the 
   active end may explicitly specify the reverse tunnel LSP for a PW), 
   West Tunnel Number and LSP Number SHOULD be set to the Tunnel ID and 
   LSP ID of the reverse LSP, respectively. Otherwise, West Tunnel 
   Number and LSP Number MUST be set to zero.

3. LDP Extensions  

   Before sending a Label Mapping message to set up a PW or PW Segment, 
   a PE has to select candidate LSPs to act as PSN tunnels. The 
   selected LSPs are carried by the PW to LSP binding TLV and sent with 
   the Label Mapping message to the target/switching PE. Therefore, 
   there may be some collisions of tunnel LSP selection when both PEs 
   assume the active role and independently signal the PW or PW Segment. 
   In order to reduce and resolve the collision of tunnel selection, 
   two types of PEs are identified here:  

   a) Active PE: the PE which initiates the selection of the tunnel 
   LSPs and informs the remote PE;  

   b) Passive PE: the PE which obeys the active PE's suggestion. 

   The role of a PE is based on the role that it takes in the signaling 
   of a specific PW. The active/passive role election is defined in the 
   Section 7.2.1 of [SEG-PW] and applies here, this document does not 
   define any new role election procedures. There exist two situations: 

   Active/Active - Both PEs of a PW or PW Segment assume active roles 
   (e.g., SS-PW, LDP using FEC 128 MS-PW). 

   Active/Passive - One PE is Active and the other is passive (e.g., 
   LDP using FEC 129 MS-PW). 

3.1.1. Active/Active Signaling Procedures 

   In a bidirectional LSP scenario, both PEs (say PE1 and PE2) send a 
   Label Mapping message carrying their own selected bidirectional LSP 
   to each other. If the bidirectional LSP in the received message from 
   other PE is as same as it was in the Label Mapping message sent by 
   itself, then the PW signaling has converged on an mutually agreed 
   tunnel LSP and selection is completed. Otherwise, when the 
   bidirectional LSP selected by one PE (say PE1) differs from the 
   bidirectional LSP selected by the other PE (say PE2), PE1 and PE2 
   have to make a choice between two tunnel LSPs. In this case PE1 and 
   PE2 can compare the Node ID, and the LSP selected by the node with 
   numerically higher ID will be determined to carry the PW. 

   In case of unidirectional LSPs, each PE may select a unidirectional 
   tunnel LSP that is used for its own forward direction of the PW and 
   send it with the Label Mapping message to the other PE. It is 
   possible that the two LSPs are not congruent. The mechanisms to 
   determine which LSPs are congruent are out of scope, but it is

Internet-Draft            PW to LSP Binding                 March 2011 
    

   assumed that each PE is able to look at the paths of LSPs (from 
   information supplied to or by the control plane, or from information 
   supplied by the management plane). In addition, each PE may 
   explicitly specify both the forward and reverse direction tunnel 
   LSPs of the PW and send them with the Label Mapping message to each 
   other. If the two PEs of the PW have the same tunnel selection (e.g., 
   for a specific PW, the forward direction tunnel LSP selected by one 
   PE is the same as the reverse direction tunnel LSP selected by the 
   other PE, and vice versa), then the PW signaling is completed and 
   has converged on an mutually agreed tunnel LSPs. Otherwise, when the 
   tunnel LSPs selected by one PE differ from the tunnel LSPs selected 
   by the other PE, the LSPs selected by the node with numerically 
   higher Node ID will be determined as the tunnel.  

   In case of one PE selects a pair of unidirectional LSPs and the 
   other PE selects a bidirectional LSP, the LSPs selected by the node 
   with numerically higher Node ID will be determined as the tunnel. 

3.1.2. Active/Passive Signaling Procedures 

 

3.1.2.1. Active PE Signaling Procedure  

   Before sending the Label Mapping message, the active PE, say PE1, 
   MUST select the tunnel LSPs for the PW or Segment PW. Then PE1 
   generates a PW to LSP Binding TLV that identifies the selected LSP 
   and sends the Label Mapping message containing it to the passive PE, 
   in this case PE2.  

   In case of bidirectional LSPs, if PE1 receives a Label Mapping 
   message in which the bidirectional LSP is the same as the 
   bidirectional LSP it selected then both directions of the PW or 
   Segment PW are setup. 

   In case of unidirectional LSPs, if PE1 specifies both the forward 
   and reverse direction tunnel LSPs in a previous Label Mapping 
   message sent by itself, when PE1 receives a Label Mapping message in 
   which the reverse tunnel LSP is the same as the forward tunnel LSP 
   and the forward tunnel LSP is the same as the reverse tunnel LSP it 
   selected, then both directions of the PW or segment PW are setup. 
   According to the passive PE procedures described in Section 3.1.2.2, 
   the identified LSPs SHOULD match. If they do not, the active PE MUST 
   assume that the peer PE is also in active role, and MUST apply the 
   procedures described in Section 3.1.1.

Internet-Draft            PW to LSP Binding                 March 2011 
    

3.1.2.2. Passive PE Signaling Procedure  

   When a Label Mapping message carrying a PW to LSP Binding TLV is 
   received by the passive PE (say PE2) it may decide, based on local 
   policy and/or success or failure in matching the LSP to accept or 
   reject it. 

   If the suggested tunnel LSPs cannot be matched successfully or if 
   local policy prohibits its acceptance, a Label Release message MUST 
   be sent, with a "No matched tunnel LSPs" code, and the processing of 
   the Label Mapping message is complete.  

   If the tunnel LSPs proposed by PE1 are accepted by PE2 then PE2 
   attempts setup of the PW in the opposite (PE2->PE1) direction, it 
   sends a Label Mapping message to PE1, with a PW to LSP Binding TLV 
   that identifies the tunnel LSPs, proposed by PE1, that it has 
   accepted for this PW. That is, for bidirectional LSPs, the PW to LSP 
   Binding TLV SHOULD identify the same bidirectional LSP proposed by 
   PE1. In case of unidirectional LSPs, if the received PW to LSP 
   Binding TLV including both forward and reverse direction tunnel LSPs, 
   the East Tunnel Number and LSP Number of the PW to LSP Binding LSP 
   SHOULD be exchanged for each other. Accordingly, the East/West Node 
   ID/Global ID of the PW to LSP Binding TLV SHOULD be exchanged as 
   well. 

4. Security Considerations  

   The ability to control which LSPs are used to carry a PW is a 
   potential security risk both for denial of service and for 
   interception of traffic. It is RECOMMENDED that PEs do not accept 
   the use of LSPs identified in the LSP Binding TLV unless the LSP end 
   points match the PW or PW segment end points. Furthermore, where 
   security of the network is believed to be at risk, it is RECOMMENDED 
   that PEs implement the LDP security mechanisms described in [RFC5036] 
   and [RFC5920]. 

5. IANA Considerations  

5.1. LDP TLV Types 

   This document defines two new TLVs [Section 2 of this document] for 
   inclusion in LDP Label Mapping message. IANA is required to assigned 
   TLV type values to the new defined TLVs from LDP "TLV Type Name 
   Space" registry.
