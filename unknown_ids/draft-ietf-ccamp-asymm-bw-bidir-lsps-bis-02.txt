  GMPLS Asymmetric Bandwidth Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
            draft-ietf-ccamp-asymm-bw-bidir-lsps-bis-02.txt

Abstract

   This document defines a method for the support of GMPLS asymmetric
   bandwidth bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  The presented
   approach is applicable to any switching technology and builds on the
   original Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) model for the transport
   of traffic-related parameters.  This document moves the experiment
   documented in RFC 5467 to the standards track and obsoletes RFC 5467.

Internet-Draft   Asymmetric Bandwidth Bidirectional LSP        June 2011


1.  Introduction

   GMPLS [RFC3473] introduced explicit support for bidirectional Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs).  The defined support matched the switching
   technologies covered by GMPLS, notably Time Division Multiplexing
   (TDM) and lambdas; specifically, it only supported bidirectional LSPs
   with symmetric bandwidth allocation.  Symmetric bandwidth
   requirements are conveyed using the semantics objects defined in
   [RFC2205] and [RFC2210].

   GMPLS asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSPs are bidirectional LSPs
   that have different bandwidth reservations in each direction.
   Support for bidirectional LSPs with asymmetric bandwidth, was
   previously discussed in the context of Ethernet, notably [RFC6060]
   and [RFC6003].  In that context, asymmetric bandwidth support was
   considered to be a capability that was unlikely to be deployed, and
   hence [RFC5467] was published as Experimental.  The MPLS Transport
   Profile, MPLS-TP, requires that asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional
   LSPs be supported, see [RFC5654], and therefore this document is
   being published on the Standards Track.  This document has no
   technical changes from the approach defined in [RFC5467].  This
   document moves the experiment documented in [RFC5467] to the
   standards track and obsoletes [RFC5467].  This document also removes
   the Ethernet technology specific alternative approach discussed in
   the appendix of [RFC5467] and maintains only one approach that is
   suitable for use with any technology.

1.1.  Background

   Bandwidth parameters are transported within RSVP ([RFC2210],
   [RFC3209], and [RFC3473]) via several objects that are opaque to
   RSVP.  While opaque to RSVP, these objects support a particular model
   for the communication of bandwidth information between an RSVP
   session sender (ingress) and receiver (egress).  The original model
   of communication, defined in [RFC2205] and maintained in [RFC3209],
   used the SENDER_TSPEC and ADSPEC objects in Path messages and the
   FLOWSPEC object in Resv messages.  The SENDER_TSPEC object was used
   to indicate a sender's data generation capabilities.  The FLOWSPEC
   object was issued by the receiver and indicated the resources that
   should be allocated to the associated data traffic.  The ADSPEC
   object was used to inform the receiver and intermediate hops of the
   actual resources available for the associated data traffic.

   With the introduction of bidirectional LSPs in [RFC3473], the model
   of communication of bandwidth parameters was implicitly changed.  In
   the context of [RFC3473] bidirectional LSPs, the SENDER_TSPEC object
   indicates the desired resources for both upstream and downstream
   directions.  The FLOWSPEC object is simply confirmation of the

Internet-Draft   Asymmetric Bandwidth Bidirectional LSP        June 2011


   allocated resources.  The definition of the ADSPEC object is either
   unmodified and only has meaning for downstream traffic, or is
   implicitly or explicitly ([RFC4606] and [RFC6003]) irrelevant.

1.2.  Approach Overview

   The approach for supporting asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSPs
   defined in this document builds on the original RSVP model for the
   transport of traffic-related parameters and GMPLS's support for
   bidirectional LSPs.

   The defined approach is generic and can be applied to any switching
   technology supported by GMPLS.  With this approach, the existing
   SENDER_TSPEC, ADSPEC, and FLOWSPEC objects are complemented with the
   addition of new UPSTREAM_TSPEC, UPSTREAM_ADSPEC, and
   UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC objects.  The existing objects are used in the
   original fashion defined in [RFC2205] and [RFC2210], and refer only
   to traffic associated with the LSP flowing in the downstream
   direction.  The new objects are used in exactly the same fashion as
   the old objects, but refer to the upstream traffic flow.  Figure 1
   shows the bandwidth-related objects used for asymmetric bandwidth
   bidirectional LSPs.

2.  Generalized Asymmetric Bandwidth Bidirectional LSPs

   The setup of an asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP is signaled
   using the bidirectional procedures defined in [RFC3473] together with
   the inclusion of the new UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC, UPSTREAM_TSPEC, and
   UPSTREAM_ADSPEC objects.

   The new upstream objects carry the same information and are used in
   the same fashion as the existing downstream objects; they differ in
   that they relate to traffic flowing in the upstream direction while
   the existing objects relate to traffic flowing in the downstream
   direction.  The new objects also differ in that they are carried in
   messages traveling in the opposite direction.

2.1.  UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC Object

   The format of an UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object is the same as a FLOWSPEC
   object [RFC2210].  This includes the definition of class types and
   their formats.  The class number of the UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object is
   TBA by IANA (of the form 0bbbbbbb).

2.1.1.  Procedures

   The Path message of an asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP MUST
   contain an UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object and MUST use the bidirectional
   LSP formats and procedures defined in [RFC3473].  The C-Type of the
   UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object MUST match the C-Type of the SENDER_TSPEC
   object used in the Path message.  The contents of the
   UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object MUST be constructed using a format and
   procedures consistent with those used to construct the FLOWSPEC
   object that will be used for the LSP, e.g., [RFC2210] or [RFC4328].

   Nodes processing a Path message containing an UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC
   object MUST use the contents of the UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object in the
   upstream label and the resource allocation procedure defined in
   Section 3.1 of [RFC3473].  Consistent with [RFC3473], a node that is
   unable to allocate a label or internal resources based on the
   contents of the UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object MUST issue a PathErr message
   with a "Routing problem/MPLS label allocation failure" indication.

2.2.  UPSTREAM_TSPEC Object

   The format of an UPSTREAM_TSPEC object is the same as a SENDER_TSPEC
   object.  This includes the definition of class types and their
   formats.  The class number of the UPSTREAM_TSPEC object is TBA by
   IANA (of the form 0bbbbbbb).

Internet-Draft   Asymmetric Bandwidth Bidirectional LSP        June 2011


2.2.1.  Procedures

   The UPSTREAM_TSPEC object describes the traffic flow that originates
   at the egress.  The UPSTREAM_TSPEC object MUST be included in any
   Resv message that corresponds to a Path message containing an
   UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object.  The C-Type of the UPSTREAM_TSPEC object
   MUST match the C-Type of the corresponding UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object.
   The contents of the UPSTREAM_TSPEC object MUST be constructed using a
   format and procedures consistent with those used to construct the
   FLOWSPEC object that will be used for the LSP, e.g., [RFC2210] or
   [RFC4328].  The contents of the UPSTREAM_TSPEC object MAY differ from
   contents of the UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object based on application data
   transmission requirements.

   When an UPSTREAM_TSPEC object is received by an ingress, the ingress
   MAY determine that the original reservation is insufficient to
   satisfy the traffic flow.  In this case, the ingress MAY tear down
   the LSP and send a PathTear message.  Alternatively, the ingress MAY
   issue a Path message with an updated UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object to
   modify the resources requested for the upstream traffic flow.  This
   modification might require the LSP to be re-routed, and in extreme
   cases might result in the LSP being torn down when sufficient
   resources are not available along the path of the LSP.

2.3.  UPSTREAM_ADSPEC Object

   The format of an UPSTREAM_ADSPEC object is the same as an ADSPEC
   object.  This includes the definition of class types and their
   formats.  The class number of the UPSTREAM_ADSPEC object is TBA by
   IANA (of the form 0bbbbbbb).

2.3.1.  Procedures

   The UPSTREAM_ADSPEC object MAY be included in any Resv message that
   corresponds to a Path message containing an UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object.
   The C-Type of the UPSTREAM_TSPEC object MUST be consistent with the
   C-Type of the corresponding UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC object.  The contents
   of the UPSTREAM_ADSPEC object MUST be constructed using a format and
   procedures consistent with those used to construct the ADSPEC object
   that will be used for the LSP, e.g., [RFC2210] or [RFC6003].  The
   UPSTREAM_ADSPEC object is processed using the same procedures as the
   ADSPEC object and, as such, MAY be updated or added at transit nodes.

3.  Packet Formats

   This section presents the RSVP message-related formats as modified by
   this section.  This document modifies formats defined in [RFC2205],
   [RFC3209], and [RFC3473].  See [RFC5511] for the syntax used by RSVP.
   Unmodified formats are not listed.  Three new objects are defined in
   this section:


         Object name            Applicable RSVP messages
         ---------------        ------------------------
         UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC      Path, PathTear, PathErr, and Notify
                                    (via sender descriptor)
         UPSTREAM_TSPEC         Resv, ResvConf, ResvTear, ResvErr, and
                                    Notify (via flow descriptor list)
         UPSTREAM_ADSPEC        Resv, ResvConf, ResvTear, ResvErr, and
                                    Notify (via flow descriptor list)

   The format of the sender description for bidirectional asymmetric
   LSPs is:


         <sender descriptor> ::=  <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC>
                                  [ <ADSPEC> ]

4.  Compatibility

   This extension reuses and extends semantics and procedures defined in
   [RFC2205], [RFC3209], and [RFC3473] to support bidirectional LSPs
   with asymmetric bandwidth.  To indicate the use of asymmetric
   bandwidth, three new objects are defined.  Each of these objects is
   defined with class numbers in the form 0bbbbbbb.  Per [RFC2205],
   nodes not supporting this extension will not recognize the new class
   numbers and will respond with an "Unknown Object Class" error.  The
   error message will propagate to the ingress, which can then take
   action to avoid the path with the incompatible node or can simply
   terminate the session.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to release the Experimental Review code points
   allocated by RFC5467 and assigne code points from the Standrads
   Action range from the objects defined in this document.

   The IANA is requested to make the assignments described below in the
   "Class Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types" section of the "RSVP
   PARAMETERS" registry.

5.1.  UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC Object

   A new class named UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC has to be created in the 0bbbbbbb
   range with the following definition:

         Class Types or C-types:

         Same values as FLOWSPEC object (C-Num 9)

5.2.  UPSTREAM_TSPEC Object

   A new class named UPSTREAM_TSPEC has to be created in the 0bbbbbbb
   range with the following definition:

         Class Types or C-types:

         Same values as SENDER_TSPEC object (C-Num 12)

5.3.  UPSTREAM_ADSPEC Object

   A new class named UPSTREAM_ADSPEC has to be created in the 0bbbbbbb
   range with the following definition:

         Class Types or C-types:

         Same values as ADSPEC object (C-Num 13)

6.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces new message objects for use in GMPLS
   signaling [RFC3473] -- specifically the UPSTREAM_TSPEC,
   UPSTREAM_ADSPEC, and UPSTREAM_FLOWSPEC objects.  These objects
   parallel the existing SENDER_TSPEC, ADSPEC, and FLOWSPEC objects but
   are used in the opposite direction.  As such, any vulnerabilities
   that are due to the use of the old objects now apply to messages
   flowing in the reverse direction.

   From a message standpoint, this document does not introduce any new
   signaling messages or change the relationship between LSRs that are
   adjacent in the control plane.  As such, this document introduces no
   additional message- or neighbor-related security considerations.

   See [RFC3473] for relevant security considerations, and [RFC5920] for
   a more general discussion on RSVP-TE security discussions.
