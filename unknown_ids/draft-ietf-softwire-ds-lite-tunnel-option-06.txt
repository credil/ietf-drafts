Internet-Draft            DS-Lite DHCPv6 Option            November 2010


1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Dual-Stack Lite [I-D.softwire-ds-lite] is a solution to offer both
   IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity to customers which are addressed only with
   an IPv6 prefix (no IPv4 address is assigned to the attachment
   device).  One of its key components is an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel,
   commonly referred to as a Softwire.  A DS-Lite "Basic Bridging
   BroadBand" (B4) device will not know if the network it is attached to
   offers Dual-Stack Lite support, and if it did would not know the
   remote end of the tunnel to establish a connection.

   To inform the B4 of the Address Family Transition Router's (AFTR)
   location, a DNS [RFC1035] hostname may be used.  Once this
   information is conveyed, the presence of the configuration indicating
   the AFTR's location also informs a host to initiate Dual-Stack Lite
   (DS-Lite) service and become a Softwire Initiator.

   To provide the conveyance of the configuration information, a single
   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] option is used, expressing the AFTR's Fully
   Qualified Domain Name to the B4 element.

   The details of how the B4 establishes an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel to the
   AFTR are out of scope for this document.


3.  The AFTR-Name DHCPv6 Option

   The AFTR-Name option consists of option-code and option-len fields
   (as all DHCPv6 options have), and a variable length tunnel-endpoint-
   name field containing a fully qualified domain name that refers to
   the AFTR which the client is asked to connect to.

   The OPTION_AFTR_NAME option MAY appear in the root scope of a DHCPv6
   packet.  It MUST NOT appear inside any IA_NA, IA_TA, IA_PD, IAADDR,
   or similar.  Any OPTION_AFTR_NAME option received inside any other
   option MUST be ignored.

   The OPTION_AFTR_NAME option MUST NOT appear more than once in a
   message.  Clients that receive more than one OPTION_AFTR_NAME options
   MUST discard all instances of that option, acting as if none were
   sent.

   The format of the AFTR-Name option is shown in the following figure:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
       |    OPTION_AFTR_NAME: (TBD)    |          option-len           |
       +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
       |                                                               |
       |                  tunnel-endpoint-name (FQDN)                  |
       |                                                               |
       +---------------------------------------------------------------+

           OPTION_AFTR_NAME: (TBD)

                 option-len: Length of the tunnel-endpoint-name field.

       tunnel-endpoint-name: A fully qualified domain name identifying
                             the tunnel endpoint, located at the DS-Lite
                             AFTR.

                 Figure 1: AFTR-Name DHCPv6 Option Format

   The tunnel-endpoint-name field is formatted as required in DHCPv6
   [RFC3315] Section 8 ("Representation and Use of Domain Names").
   Briefly, the format described is using a single octet noting the
   length of one DNS label (limited to at most 63 octets), followed by
   the label contents.  This repeats until all labels in the FQDN are
   exhausted, including a terminating zero-length label.  Any updates to
   Section 8 of DHCPv6 [RFC3315] also apply to encoding of this field.
   An example format for this option is shown in Figure 2, which conveys
   the FQDN "aftr.example.com.".

        +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
        | 0x04 |   a  |   f  |   t  |   r  | 0x07 |   e  |   x  |   a  |
        +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
        |   m  |   p  |   l  |   e  | 0x03 |   c  |   o  |   m  | 0x00 |
        +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+

                  Figure 2: Example tunnel-endpoint-name.

   Note that in the specific case of the example tunnel-endpoint-name,
   (Figure 2) the length of the tunnel-endpoint-name is 18 octets, and
   so an option-len field value of 18 would be used.

   The option is validated by confirming that the option-len is greater
   than 3, that the option data can be contained by the option length
   (that the option length does not run off the end of the packet), that
   individual label lengths do not exceed the option length, and that

   the tunnel-endpoint-name is of valid format as described in DHCPv6
   Section 8 [RFC3315]; there are no compression tags, there is at least
   one label of nonzero length.


4.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   A DHCPv6 server MUST NOT send more than one OPTION_AFTR_NAME option.

   A DHCPv6 server MUST NOT send the OPTION_AFTR_NAME option as a
   suboption in other options; it MUST appear only in the root scope of
   any DHCPv6 messages made in response to clients (Reply, Advertise, et
   al).

   RFC 3315 Section 17.2.2 [RFC3315] describes how a DHCPv6 client and
   server negotiate configuration values using the Option Request Option
   (OPTION_ORO).  As a convenience to the reader, we mention here that a
   server will not reply with a value for the OPTION_AFTR_NAME if the
   client has not explicitly enumerated it on its OPTION_ORO.


5.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   A client that supports the B4 functionality of DS-Lite (defined in
   [I-D.softwire-ds-lite]) and conforms to this specification MUST
   include OPTION_AFTR_NAME on its OPTION_ORO.

   Because it requires DNS name to address resolution, a client MAY also
   wish to include the OPTION_DNS_SERVERS option on its OPTION_ORO.

   If the client receives the OPTION_AFTR_NAME option, it MUST verify
   the option contents as described in Section 3.

   If the client receives more than one OPTION_AFTR_NAME option, it MUST
   discard all instances of that option.

   The client performs standard DNS resolution using the provided FQDN
   to resolve a AAAA record, as defined in [RFC3596] and STD 13
   [RFC1034] [RFC1035].

   If any DNS response contains more than one IPv6 address, the client
   picks only one IPv6 address and uses it as a remote tunnel endpoint.
   The client MUST NOT establish more than one DS-Lite tunnel at the
   same time.  For a redundancy and high availability discussion, see
   Section 7.2 "High availability" of [I-D.softwire-ds-lite].

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not present any new security issues, but as with
   all DHCPv6-derived configuration state, it is completely possible
   that the configuration is being delivered by a third party (Man In
   The Middle).  As such, there is no basis to trust that the access the
   DS-Lite Softwire connection represents can be trusted, and it should
   not therefore bypass any security mechanisms such as IP firewalls.

   RFC 3315 [RFC3315] discusses DHCPv6-related security issues.

   [I-D.softwire-ds-lite] discusses DS-Lite related security issues.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate single DHCPv6 option code referencing
   this document, delineating OPTION_AFTR_NAME.
