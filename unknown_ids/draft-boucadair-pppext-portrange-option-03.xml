      <t>This document defines two IPCP (IP Configuration Protocol) Options
      used to convey a set of ports. These options can be used in the context
      of port range-based solutions (port range delegation) or NAT-based ones
      (port delegation or port forwarding). Architectural considerations are
      out of scope of this document.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Within the context of IPv4 address depletion, several solutions have
      been investigated to share IPv4 addresses. Two flavours can be
      distinguished: NAT-based solutions (a.k.a., Carrier Grade NAT(CGN, <xref
      target="I-D.shirasaki-nat444-isp-shared-addr"></xref>)) or port range
      based ones (<xref target="I-D.boucadair-port-range"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ymbk-aplusp"></xref> are examples of solutions which propose
      to share the same (public) IP address among several devices and to
      constrain the values used as port sources to a limited set of values).
      Port range-based solutions do not require an additional NAT level in the
      service provider's domain. Several means may be used to convey Port
      Range information.</t>

      <t>This document defines the notion of Port Mask which is generic and
      flexible. Several allocation schemes may be implemented when using a
      Port Mask. It proposes a basic mechanism that allows the allocation of a
      unique port range to a requesting client. </t>

      <t>This document defines new IPCP options to be used to carry Port Range
      information. IPCP has been widely used to convey configuration
      information such as IP Compression Protocol <xref
      target="RFC3241"></xref><xref target="RFC3544"></xref> or IP-Address
      <xref target="RFC1332"></xref>.</t>

      <t>IPv4 address exhaustion is only provided as an example of the usage
      of the PPP IPCP Options defined in this document. In particular, Port
      Range Options may be used independently of the presence of IP-Address
      IPCP Option.</t>

      <section title="Use Cases">
        <t>Port Range Options can be used in port range-based solutions (e.g.,
        <xref target="I-D.boucadair-port-range"></xref>) or in a CGN-based
        solution to bypass the NAT (i.e., for transparent NAT traversal and
        avoid involving several NAT in the path) or to delegate one or a set
        of ports to the requesting client (e.g., avoid ALG (Application Level
        Gateway) or for port forwarding). </t>

        <t>For improved security an option for delegating cryptographically
        random port range is defined.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>To differentiate between a Port Range containing a contiguous span
        of port numbers and a Port Range with non contiguous and possibly
        random port numbers, the following denominations are used:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Contiguous Port Range: a set of port values which form a
            contiguous sequence.</t>

            <t>Non Contiguous Port Range: a set of port values which does not
            form a contiguous sequence.</t>

            <t>Random Port Range: a cryptographically random set of port
            values.</t>
          </list>Unless explicitly mentioned, Port Mask refers to the couple
        (Port Range Value, Port Range Mask).</t>

        <t>In addition, this document makes use of the following terms:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Delegated port or port range: a port or a range of ports
            belonging to an IP address managed by an upstream device (such as
            NAT), which are delegated to a client for use as source address
            and port when sending packets.</t>

            <t>Forwarded port or port range: a port or a range of ports
            belonging to an IP address managed by an upstream device such as
            (NAT), which is/are statically mapped to the internal IP address
            of the client and same port number of the client.</t>
          </list>This memo uses the same terminology as per <xref
        target="RFC1661"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Port Range Options">
      <t>This section defines the IPCP Option for Port Range delegation.</t>

      <section title="Description of Port Range Value and Port Range Mask">
        <t>The Port Range Value and Port Range Mask are used to specify one
        range of ports (contiguous or not contiguous) pertaining to a given IP
        address. Concretely, Port Range Mask and Port Range Value are used to
        notify a remote peer about the Port Mask to be applied when selecting
        a port value as a source port. The Port Range Value is used to infer a
        set of allowed port values. A Port Range Mask defines a set of ports
        that all have in common a subset of pre-positioned bits. This set of
        ports is also called Port Range. Two port numbers are said to belong
        to the same Port Range if and only if, they have the same Port Range
        Mask.</t>

        <t>A Port Mask is composed of a Port Range Value and a Port Range
        Mask:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The Port Range Value indicates the value of the significant
            bits of the Port Mask. The Port Range Value is coded as follows:
            <list style="symbols">
                <t>The significant bits may take a value of 0 or 1.</t>

                <t>All the other bits (a.k.a., non significant ones) are set
                to 0.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>The Port Range Mask indicates, by the bit(s) set to 1, the
            position of the significant bits of the Port Range Value.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>This IPCP Configuration Option provides a way to negotiate the Port
        Range to be used on the local end of the link. It allows the sender of
        the Configure-Request message to state which Port Range associated
        with a given IP address is desired, or to request the peer to provide
        the configuration. The peer can provide this information by NAKing the
        option, and returning a valid Port Range (i.e., (Port Range Value,
        Port Range Mask)).</t>

        <t>When the server assigns only shared IP addresses, the peer MUST
        include Port Range Option in its request. If not, 0.0.0.0 is assigned
        by the server to that peer.</t>

        <t>When a peer issues a request enclosing IPCP Port Range Option, and
        if the server does not support this option, the Port Range Option is
        rejected by the server.</t>

        <t>The formats of the Port Range IPCP Option is provided in <xref
        target="Figure_1"></xref>.</t>

              Range Mask is set to 496.</t>
