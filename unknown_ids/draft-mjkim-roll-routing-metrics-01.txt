Internet-Draft          Routing Metrics for LLNs            October 2008


1.  Note

   Some of the routing metrics defined in this document may be subject
   to change or may even be removed in light of the routing requirements
   currently being specified by the Routing Over Low power and Lossy
   networks (ROLL) Working Group.  For the sake of illustration, some
   metrics are only meaningful in routing protocols that fall into the
   category of Distance Vector.  Since the Working Group has not yet
   determined which routing protocol will be chosen for Low power and
   Lossy Networks (LLNs), it is not yet possible to determine whether
   such metrics will be required.  Conversely, other metrics may be
   further specified depending on which routing protocol is selected by
   the Working Group.

   In this revision of the document, a list of link and node metrics is
   specified.  It is well understood that some of these metrics are by
   nature highly dynamic, which may lead to routing oscillations.
   Furthermore, dynamic metrics may be too CPU intensive for highly
   constrained devices.  Consequently, it is probable that some of them
   will be removed from this document in light of the discussion that
   will take place in the Working Group.

   Link and node metrics packet format or methods to encode the data
   will be defined in a further revision of this document.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", 'RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document makes use of the terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-
   terminology].

   o  Mobile LLN: Low power and Lossy Network where some nodes are
      mobile.

   o  Fixed LLN: Low power and Lossy Network where all nodes are static,
      not mobile.


3.  Introduction

   This document specifies routing metrics to be used in path
   calculation for Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (ROLL).
   Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics
   compared with traditional wired networks or even with similar ones

   such as mobile ad-hoc networks.  By contrast with typical Interior
   Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing metrics using hop counts or link
   metrics, this document specifies a set of routing metrics suitable to
   LLNs.

   Routing metrics can be classified according to the following set of
   characteristics:

   - Link versus Node metrics

   - Qualitative versus quantitative

   - Dynamic or static

   Historically, IGP such as OSPF [RFC2328] and IS-IS [RFC1142] have
   been using quantitative static link metrics.  Other mechanisms such
   as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE)
   [RFC2702] make use of other link attributes such as the available
   reserved bandwidth, affinities and so on to compute constrained
   shortest paths for Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
   LSPs).

   It must be noted that the use of dynamic metrics is not new and has
   been experimented in ARPANET 2 [Khanna1989], with a moderate success.
   Indeed, the use of dynamic metrics is not trivial and very careful
   care must be given to the use of dynamic metrics that may lead to
   potential routing instabilities.

   As pointed out in various routing requirements documents (see
   draft-ietf-roll-urban-routing-reqs,
   draft-ietf-roll-indus-routing-reqs,
   draft-ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs) in LLNs, it is required to take
   into account a set of node constraints during path computation.  Node
   metrics include node's resources such as memory, energy and CPU
   (computational power).  Moreover, node attributes such as the ability
   to act as an aggregator (node capable of performing data aggregation)
   may be of interest.  Additionally, work load, transmission range and
   dynamicity (mobility, duty cycle, etc) may also be considered.  Link
   attributes include propagation delay, reliability (quality) and
   available bandwidth.

   By contrast with the current Internet, links and nodes in LLNs have
   changing characteristics in terms of reliability and available
   resources.  Thus, it is required to specify a set of dynamic metrics.
   For instance, even though a wireless sensor network topology is
   static in absence of failure, nodes' workload and resource such as
   residual energy and available memory are changing continuously and
   may have to be taken into account during the path computation.



Kim, Vasseur et al.      Expires April 19, 2009                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          Routing Metrics for LLNs            October 2008


   Similarly, link attributes including latency and reliability may
   change over time because moving obstacles can appear at any time.
   That being said, very careful attention must be given when using
   highly dynamic metrics and attributes that affect routing decisions
   in order to preserve the routing stability.  Furthermore, it is time
   and energy consuming process to update these dynamic metrics and
   recompute the routing tables on a frequent basis.  Therefore, it may
   be desirable to use a set of discrete values to reduce computational
   overhead and bandwidth utilization.  Of course, this comes with a
   cost, namely, reduced metric accuracy.

   Reliability is an example of qualitative parameter.  However, to be
   routing metrics for path calculation, qualitative parameters may be
   transformed to quantitative values.  Rules must be defined to make
   the qualitative parameters appear in quantitative forms.
   Quantitative form can be numbers or levels.

   This document specifies a set of link and nodes metrics that can be
   used to compute paths within a LLN.  Some link or node attributes
   (e.g. level of link reliability, energy remaining on the node) can be
   used to perform constraint-based routing.  It is not required to use
   all the metrics and attributes specified in this document.  A
   particular implementation MAY use a subset or all of the metrics
   defined in this document.

   The specification of the objective function used to compute the path
   is out of the scope of this document.


4.  Node attributes

   In most cases, node attributes are static.  However, critical
   attributes such as residual power might need to be considered as
   dynamic attributes and monitored continuously in some scenarios.  An
   implementation MUST make use of multi-threshold scheme rather than
   fine granular metric update so as to avoid constant routing changes.
   "Multi-threshold scheme" sets a few levels to categorize metric
   values and uses the levels as discrete values instead of actual
   values.

   In LLNs, it is not uncommon to have highly heterogeneous nodes in
   term of capabilities (e.g. node being battery operated or not, amount
   of memory, etc) and functionalities.  More capable and stable nodes
   can assist the most constrained ones for routing packets, which
   results in extension of network lifetime and efficient network
   operations.  This implies that constraint-based routing will be used
   in some cases.  Thus, the computed path may not be the shortest path
   according to some specified metrics.

Internet-Draft          Routing Metrics for LLNs            October 2008


4.1.  Node resources

   Memory and CPU resources are critical node resources in presence of
   constrained nodes.  Resource-awareness should be employed to routing
   protocols strictly or loosely considering trade-off between cost and
   benefit.

4.2.  Residual Energy

   Low power is one of the most distinguished features of LLNs, so node
   residual energy is a pivotal metric in environments where nodes are
   battery powered.  Residual energy should be taken as a relative value
   considering statistical node lifetime and other conditions such as
   the role of the node in the network.  For example, if the node's
   expected lifetime is 5 years and the remaining energy is only one
   fifth, then the energy is a critical resource for the node.  In such
   cases, the routing protocol engine may compute a longer path
   (constrained based) for some traffic in order to increase the network
   life duration.  Hence, whenever possible, the node should not be
   selected as a router (an intermediate node to deliver data), thus the
   support for constrained-based routing is needed.  Another typical use
   of constrained-based routing consists of using a node attribute as a
   routing criterion.  For example, the routing engine may prefer a
   "longer" path that traverses main powered nodes or nodes equipped
   with rechargeable batteries.  Algorithm can be designed to consider a
   combination of node metrics and node attributes.  Algorithms defining
   how such metrics and attributes should be combined are outside of the
   scope of this document.

   Generally, the residual energy should be taken as a dynamic metric.
   Most battery operated devices have the ability to estimate the
   remaining energy [I-D.ietf-roll-indus-routing-reqs].  However,
   initial energy status can be considered as a static metric in some
   situations where monitoring the energy level is too CPU intensive.
   Simply categorizing devices into two classes, main-powered and
   battery-powered may be sufficient to compute the path in highly
   constrained scenarios.

4.3.  Node workload

   Node workload may be hard to determine and express in some scalar
   form.  However, node workload could be a useful metric to consider
   during path calculation, in particular when data processing along the
   data path is required or queuing delays must be minimized for highly
   sensitive traffic.  Using a simple 1-bit flag to characterize the
   node workload may provide a sufficient level of granularity,
   similarly to the "overload" bit used in protocols such as IS-IS
   [RFC1142].  An implementation may then decide to exclude from its

Internet-Draft          Routing Metrics for LLNs            October 2008


   routes any node with a "heavy" value for workload unless there is no
   alternative.

4.4.  Node latency

   Node latency is defined as the time span from the arrival time to the
   departure time of a given packet at a node.  It is primarily made up
   of packet processing time, queuing delays and packet transmission
   time.  Node latency is highly correlated with other metrics.  Indeed,
   heavy workload increases node latency.

4.5.  Data Aggregation attribute

   Some nodes may sense or receive the same (or similar) data if the
   nodes are located in a close area due to data correlation.  Thus,
   data aggregation/fusion may be possible.  Data fusion involves more
   complicated processing to improve accuracy of the output data while
   data aggregation mostly aims to reduce the amount of data.
   Especially in urban applications where sensor nodes collect
   environmental information and send it to a data sink, a potentially
   large amount of nodes sense similar data.  For the sake of
   illustration, consider the simple example shown in the Figure 1.  Let
   us assume that three nodes A, B and C need to send sensed data to the
   data sink.  Node A sensed "xyz" and sent this data to node C. Since C
   also sensed same data, it has no additional information from node A.
   However, because the data node B sent is "xqz", node C aggregates
   this data with its own data "xyz" resulting in "xyqz".  Therefore,
   node C sends "xyqz" to the data sink.  In this example, each node's
   data requires 3 bytes.  If no aggregation is performed, node C needs
   to send 9 byte data to the sink, but C only sends 4 bytes thanks to
   data aggregation.


                            A               B
                         |------|        |------|
                         | xyz  |        | xqz  |
                         |______|        |______|
                               \          /
                                \        /
                                 \  C   /             sink
                                 |------|    xyqz   |------|
                                 | xyz  |-----------|      |
                                 |______|           |______|



                        Figure 1: Data aggregation




Kim, Vasseur et al.      Expires April 19, 2009                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          Routing Metrics for LLNs            October 2008


   Some applications may make use of the aggregation node attribute in
   their routing decision so as to minimize the amount of traffic on the
   network, thus potentially increasing its life time in battery
   operated environments.

   To make data aggregation possible, the routing protocol needs to
   capture the time and location dependent correlation among sensed data
   from nodes on the possible routes, which may be challenging.
   Obtaining correlation structure also demands high resource (energy)
   consumption and in-network processing itself may have high
   complexity.  Consequently, in most applications, data aggregation may
   not be adopted for routing.  Applications where high directional data
   flow is expected in a regular basis may take advantage of data
   aggregation supported routing.

4.6.  Node degree

   Node degree is the number of neighbors that can receive a message
   from the node directly.  In other words, neighbors are nodes located
   within the transmission range of the node.  Note that not all the
   neighbors may be able to send a message to the node directly in the
   presence of asymmetric links.  Generally, a high node degree can be
   helpful for quick path recovery when the next hop node on the path
   fails.  Therefore, it may be beneficial to select a node with a high
   degree when computing a path.  On the other hand, a node with a high
   degree has a high possibility to suffer from high workload in a
   congested network.  Therefore, node degree has to be carefully
   utilized in routing decision.

4.7.  Dynamicity

   Node dynamicity can be measured by many different factors such as
   mobility, transmission range, duty cycle, and the rate at which node
   joins and leaves the network.  Node dynamicity directly affects the
   network topology and connectivity, which in turn may trigger path re-
   computation.  For that reason, node dynamicity needs to be monitored
   and quantified utilizing a well defined objective function.  Thus,
   less dynamic nodes should be preferred for path selection.  In the
   most constrained LLN environments, the simple heuristic of
   classifying nodes into static and dynamic can be very helpful in
   routing decision.  Node dynamicity may either be a static or a
   dynamic metric.

4.8.  Node reliability

   Node reliability refers to the node failure rate.  It is usually very
   challenging to estimate or monitor node reliability and historical
   data can be used to that end.  A specific function needs to be



Kim, Vasseur et al.      Expires April 19, 2009                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          Routing Metrics for LLNs            October 2008


   defined to get values of the reliability metric from a variety of
   features affecting node reliability.

   A sleeping node should not be an intermediate node to deliver a
   packet, thus status of a node must be monitored or should be
   predictable.  Additionally, residual energy of a node should be
   predictable not to make the node suddenly die during routing process
   due to battery out.  Nodes on the chosen path for routing should be
   reliable.


5.  Link metrics and attributes

   There are several dynamic link attributes especially in wireless
   LLNs.  Even in case of fixed LLNs where nodes are stationary, link
   qualities may greatly vary in the presence of obstacles and signal
   interference.  That being said, as for node metrics and attributes,
   link metrics and attributes may be considered as static in fixed LLNs
   not only because it is very challenging to update them in real-time
   but also because updating mechanisms may be too time and energy
   consuming.  However, in mobile LLNs, we may need to consider these
   metrics and attributes as dynamic.

5.1.  Bandwidth

   The link bandwidth can be considered as a link capacity metric.  It
   must be remembered that in case of wireless link, the link capacity
   is shared among nodes in a single wireless link and is a dynamic
   metric.

5.2.  Reliability (Quality)

   Link reliability can be measured by the Bit Error Rate (BER), Mean
   Time Between Failures (MTBF) or link churn, the rate at which links
   see their status changed (up or down).  Link reliability is closely
   related to node reliability especially in wireless LLNs.  Two nodes
   which form a link affect directly to the link reliability as follows:
   if one (or both) end node of the link dies or moves away beyond of
   the transmission range from the other node, the link vanishes and
   should be removed from routing.  However, link reliability is also
   influenced by other factors like unexpected obstacles or temporary
   interference.

   Just like node reliability is critical, link reliability is also
   essential for routing given that most nodes have very short duty
   cycles.  A change in link quality can effect network connectivity.
   Therefore, link quality may be taken into account as a critical
   routing metric.  As mentioned earlier, link quality metric should be



Kim, Vasseur et al.      Expires April 19, 2009                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          Routing Metrics for LLNs            October 2008


   applied to each directional link unless bi-directionality is one of
   routing metrics.  Since path reliability is a function of each link
   and node reliability, such metrics may become critical as path length
   increases.

5.3.  Propagation delay

   Propagation delay is the time taken for the packet to traverse the
   link from the source node to the target node.  Path latency is the
   sum of all nodes' latencies and all links!_ propagation delays along
   the path.  As mentioned earlier, propagation delay can be obtained by
   averaging historical data.

5.4.  Bi-directionality

   Real radio systems in the field have asymmetric links for a few
   reasons.  Two devices with different radio coverage or transmission
   power will experience asymmetry in the reliability of the link
   between them.  Moreover, same types of devices often have asymmetric
   links due to manufacturing variances in the radios.  Since many
   routing algorithms actually construct paths using links in the
   reverse direction, a routing path may be created that is functional
   in the destination to source direction, but not in the forward
   direction.  Routing protocols should detect asymmetrical links and
   construct paths using forwards links instead of reverse links.
   Therefore, bi-directionality is another important factor to consider
   link attributes as routing metrics.  There are two options to take
   care of this issue.  One is making bi-directionality one of routing
   metrics (probably as a link attribute).  This is quite challenging
   since deciding whether a link is symmetric or not is not easy.  The
   other way is that directional links should be considered when related
   metrics is used for path calculation.  The latter option means, for
   instance, propagation delay or link reliability should be associated
   with each directional link.  Thus, any opposite directional two links
   connecting two nodes may have different link attributes.

5.5.  Link Coloring

   Link color is an administrative static attribute used to avoid or
   attract specific links for specific traffic types.


6.  Computation of dynamic metrics and attributes

   As already pointed out, dynamically calculated metrics are of the
   utmost importance in many circumstances in LLNs.  This is mainly
   because a variety of metrics change on a frequent basis, thus
   implying the need to adapt the routing decisions.  That being said,



Kim, Vasseur et al.      Expires April 19, 2009                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          Routing Metrics for LLNs            October 2008


   careful care must be given to the pace at which such metrics and
   attributes change.

   Algorithms used to compute such metrics MUST use multi-threshold
   mechanisms with low and high water marks for binary values and a
   limited set of discrete metric values for non binary metric.
   Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED to use a low-pass filter to avoid
   rapid fluctuations of these values.  Finally, although the
   specification of path computation algorithms using dynamic metrics
   are out the scope of this document, it is RECOMMENDED to design the
   objective function carefully to avoid too frequent computation of new
   routes upon metric values changes.

   Controlled adaptation of the routing metrics and rate at which path
   are computed are critical to avoid undesirable routing instabilities
   resulting in increased latencies and packet loss because of temporary
   micro-loops.  Furthermore, since LLNs are made of constrained
   devices, computational resources must be used with care to preserve
   battery in case of battery operated devices and not to impact quality
   of service of the data traffic.


7.  Open issues

   Other items to be addressed in further revisions of this document
   include:

   o  Metrics related to security: Metrics that security is associated
      with need to be further considered.  If a route is comprised of
      authenticated and authorized nodes for the data, then the route
      may be preferable.

   o  Consideration of routing efficiency and stability: Since LLNs are
      highly constrained networks, maintaining many different routing
      metrics is challenging.  Routing should be lightweight.  In
      addition, careful condition should be given to the dynamic nature
      of some metrics and their implication on routing stability.


8.  Metric consistency

   Since a set of metrics and attributes will be used for links and
   nodes in LLN, it is particularly critical to ensure the use of
   consistent metric calculation mechanisms for all links and nodes in
   the network.  Although this is applicable to all routing scheme, a
   number of such metrics and attributes in LLN makes it particularly
   challenging.

9.  Security Considerations

   Routing metrics should be handled in a secure and trustful manner.
   For instance, a malicious node can not advertise falsely that it has
   good metrics for routing and belong to the established path to have a
   chance to intercept packets.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests no action by IANA.
