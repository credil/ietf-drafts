    <abstract>
      <t>A framework for the exchange of capabilities in HELD is described.  Capabilities for enabling Device-based measurements and Device-based location generation are defined based on this framework.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

      <t>A Device is a good source of information about its location.  Even where a Device is unable to independently determine its location, it can often make observations about its environment and network attachment that are of use in determining its position.  Making this information available to the Location Information Server (LIS) in the access network can improve the quality of location estimates for the Device.
      </t>

      <t>Requests that retrieve location information by value are largely covered by the measurement information and data formats described in <xref target="I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements"/>.  However, location information provided through location URIs cannot utilise this information.
      </t>

      <t>This document outlines a method whereby a Device indicates capabilities to a LIS during the creation of a HELD context (see <xref target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context"/>).  The LIS is able to then exercise those capabilities to assist it in the generation of location information, or to acquire location information from the Device.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="conventions" title="Conventions used in this document">
      <t>This document relies on definitions from a range of specification.  Use of the terms LIS and Device is consistent with <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/>.  Location measurement is defined in <xref target="I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements"/> and location estimate is defined in <xref target="I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty"/>.  The term HELD context (or just context) is used as defined in <xref target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context"/>.
      </t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="overview" title="Capabilities Exchange Overview">
      <t>Acquiring location measurements or information from a Device is made difficult by the nature of the relationship between the LIS, or access network, and the Device.  The relationship between a LIS and the Devices that it serves is often transient.  A Device is not necessarily a permanent part of an access network.
      </t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery">HELD</xref> provides a basis for the relationship between Device and LIS.  LIS Discovery <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery"/> provides a means for the Device to initiate the relationship.  The relationship is extended to include stateful information at the LIS in the form of a <xref target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context">HELD context</xref>.  This document builds HELD contexts by providing a means for the LIS to request information from the Device.
      </t>

      <t>This document describes how a HELD context can be used as the basis for cooperative location determination.  A Device provides the LIS with a capabilities indication when it creates or updates its context data.  The LIS responds with a capabilities agreement, that includes which of these capabilities it might use.
      </t>

      <t>In the process of serving requests to a location URI, a LIS might determine that certain Device capabilities could be useful or necessary in completing the request.  The LIS is able to invoke specific capabilities to request location information, location measurements, or any other information from the Device.
      </t>

      <t>Device capabilities include the ability to generate or acquire location information, or the ability to make observations about the mode of network attachment or environment.  For instance, a Device with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) hardware can determine its own position by taking a set of measurements and performing a calculation, or it can provide the GNSS measurement data.
      </t>

      <t>This document defines a set of capabilities that a Device can use to indicate that it is able to provide location measurements.  The form of location measurements is described in <xref target="I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements"/>.  A Device is able to use these capabilities to indicate to the LIS the types of measurements that it can observe and the means by which the LIS can acquire these measurements when needed.  <xref target="logical"/> shows a logical overview of a simple scenario where the LIS uses a Device-provided measurement to service a request to a location URI.

    <section title="Capabilities Exchange">
      <t>To indicate capabilities to a LIS, a Device sends a capability indication to the LIS in a HELD <spanx style="verb">createContext</spanx> request.  The capability indication includes a set of capabilities, each identified by a URI.  The LIS selects those capabilities that it might make use of and provides a capabilities agreement that includes the selected capabilities in a <spanx style="verb">contextResponse</spanx> message.

      <t>Once a common set of capabilities are agreed upon, the LIS is able invoke these capabilities to generate location information.  This might be an ability to generate geodetic location information at the Device, or the Device might be able provide the LIS with location measurements.  Agreed capabilities and associated parameters can be stored in the HELD context for later use in serving requests.
      </t>

      <t>The LIS invokes capabilities as it is necessary to service requests to the HELD context.  For instance, capabilities might be used to respond to a location request made by a location recipient (LR) to one of the location URIs provided by the context.

      <t>Capabilities are related to a single context.  The LIS MUST restrict its use of capabilities to requests relating to the context where the capabilities are provided by the Device.  The LIS MUST remove any pre-existing capabilities from a context when it receives a capabilities indication.  Therefore, a Device is able to remove specific capabilities from a context by providing a capabilities indication that omits that capability.  An empty capabilities indication removes all capabilities.
      </t>

      <t>A capabilities exchange may contain additional information that is specific to the associated measurement acquisition method.  This additional information allows the Device and LIS to provide more information about individual capabilities.  This information is stored along with the agreed capabilities in the HELD context.
      </t>

    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="The Capability Indication">
    <t>A <spanx style="verb">capabilities</spanx> element is added to the create context or update context HELD requests.  The Device initiates the exchange, including the <spanx style="verb">capind</spanx> element in the request message.  The <spanx style="verb">capagree</spanx> element contain in the response from the LIS includes the set of capabilities that might be used.
    </t>

    <t>Both <spanx style="verb">capind</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">capagree</spanx> elements contain a set of capability indications.  A single capability is represented by a <spanx style="verb">cap</spanx> element.  Each <spanx style="verb">cap</spanx> element has a mandatory <spanx style="verb">uri</spanx> attribute that contains a URI unique to the type of capability.  An <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> attribute identifies the individual capability within the context of an exchange; the value used by the LIS matches the corresponding indication by the Device.
    </t>

    <t>The <spanx style="verb">cap</spanx> element may also contain arbitrary content, which means that the element is able to carry supplementary information that is specific to the capability.  This supplementary information could include addressing information, protocol selection, authentication details, or any data necessary for the successful retrieval of information.  Different supplementary information can be provided by the Device and LIS.
    </t>

    <t>The optional <spanx style="verb">responseTime</spanx> attribute of the <spanx style="verb">cap</spanx> element indicates the expected time that invoking that particular capability takes.  This parameter assists the LIS in deciding whether or not to invoke a capability when serving a request for location information.  The <spanx style="verb">responseTime</spanx> attribute is an integer value in milliseconds.  The <spanx style="verb">responseTime</spanx> attribute only appears in a capabilities indication.
    <list style="empty"><t>The Device is only able to quantify the time for its own involvement in the process; additional delays from polling, network transit and LIS processing need to be included in any decision to invoke a Device capability.
    </t></list>
    </t>

    <t>Multiple capability indications are not necessary, since a set of capabilities can be specified in the same element.  A LIS MAY either select an arbitrary capability indication, or combine capabilities from multiple indications.

      <section title="HTTP Polling">
        <t>The Device monitors this resource, using either <xref target="I-D.loreto-http-bidirectional">HTTP long-polling</xref> or periodic requests (short-polling.
        </t>

        <t>If long-polling is used, the Device indicates this by using the <spanx style="verb">Response-Time (TBD)</spanx> header and a conditional request header, such as <spanx style="verb">If-Modified-Since</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">If-None-Match</spanx>.  If the request times out before the resource is updated, the server indicates this with an HTTP 304 response.  An HTTP 200 response is sent immediately when the resource is updated.  In order to continue monitoring the state of the resource after either response, the Device immediately sends another request.
        </t>

        <t>In the absence of the conditional HTTP headers, the server can assume that short-polling is in use.  If short-polling is used, the Device should limit the frequency of requests based on the time indicated in the HTTP <spanx style="verb">Expires</spanx> header.
        </t>

        <t>The LIS updates this resource to indicate which capability it wishes to invoke and any conditions on the invocation.

      <section title="Invocation Resource">
        <t>The resource that the Device monitors contains instructions from the LIS.  The information contained by this resource is used to invoke one or more capabilities.

        <t>The value of the invocation resource determines what information is required.  This document is an XML document with the MIME type of <spanx style="verb">application/held+xml</spanx> and a document element of <spanx style="verb">capinv</spanx>.  Initially, this document is likely to be empty (containing a single, empty <spanx style="verb">capinv</spanx> element).

        <t>A change in the state of the invocation resource triggers the behaviour associated with a given capability.  The value of the invocation resource indicates the capability, and any actions that is desired.

        <figure>
          <preamble>For instance, if the LIS wants to invoke the location capability of the Device, it updates the document to the following:

        <t>The Device MUST continue to monitor the invocation resource.  Therefore, any request can be cancelled by removing capabilities from the invocation document; or updated by changing the capability details.  Expiry of the HELD context, or removal of the invocation resource terminates any monitoring.  An HTTP 404 (Not Found) or 410 (Gone) response is sufficient indication to the Device that the resource no longer exists.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Invocation Time">
      <t>The <spanx style="verb">before</spanx> attribute on the capability invocation serves to advise the Device on the latest time when a response is needed.  For the two capabilities defined in this document, this time is the latest moment that information from the Device is of use to the LIS.  If this time has passed, or the capability cannot be invoked before this time, then the capability invocation can be ignored.
      </t>

      <t>The <spanx style="verb">periodic</spanx> attribute on a capability establishes a requirement for periodic updates.  The attribute contains a time interval in milliseconds, which specifies the periodicity desired.  This indicates that the Device provide information before the time specified in the <spanx style="verb">before</spanx> attribute and periodically thereafter at the specified interval.   Periodic invocations continue until the invocation is modified or removed.

        <preamble>For instance, the following invocation contains a request to provide Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements before <spanx style="verb">2009-07-09T13:55:01+10:00</spanx> and at 60 second intervals (before 13:55:01, then before 13:56:01, then 13:57:01, and continuing indefinitely).

      <section title="Responding to a Capability Invocation">
        <t>A Device that wishes to provide information MUST do so when it receives an invocation that it can comply with.  The information is pushed to the URI indicated in the <spanx style="verb">target</spanx> element as an HTTP PUT.  The format of the information provided depends on the capability.
        </t>

        <t>Information provided in this manner can be considered as additional supplementary information added to the HELD context.  The same authorization rules that apply to the context apply to this data.  A LIS is able to redistribute this information and anything results based on this information under the same terms as the context operates.  This information MUST be removed when the context is removed.  Explicit data expiration indications, such as that used in <xref target="I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements"/>, MUST be respected.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Multiple Invocations">
        <t>The same invoke resource MAY be used for multiple capabilities.  Devices that support multiple capabililties identify the capability that the LIS desires to use through the capability identification provided.  If multiple capabilities are invoked at the same time, the Device MAY choose to provide all information concurrently, or separately.  The Device MAY choose to provide some information, then only provide the additional information if the invoke resource continues to include a request for the additional information.
        </t>

        <t>The measurement capability inherently supports provision of multiple measurements concurrently.  A single measurement container can be provided with multiple different forms of measurement.  In comparison, the location capability does not provide this option.  Unless specifically stated in the definition of a capability, responding to each invocation requires a separate HTTP request.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="location" title="The Location Capability">
      <t>The ability to locate itself is a trait that is applicable to Devices in a range of networks.  This includes automated location determination, like Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), user input, an alternative location service, or a range of location techniques.  Because the Device produces complete location information, there is no need for technology- or network-specific features in messages.  Therefore, this section describes how a Device may advertise its capability to source its own location.
      </t>

      <t>This section defines a location capability, identified by the URN <spanx style="verb">urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:location</spanx>.  This capability indicates that the Device is able to provide location information to the LIS.
      </t>

      <t>The location capability is invoked using the method described in <xref target="poll"/>.  A URI is provided by the LIS and the Device monitors this resource.  If the location capability is invoked, the Device provides location information, in the form of a PIDF-LO.  The Device uses an HTTP PUT to the target URI.  The PUT request includes a PIDF-LO document and a <spanx style="verb">Content-Type</spanx> of <spanx style="verb">application/pidf+xml</spanx>.
      </t>

      <t>Only the <spanx style="verb">location-info</spanx> element of the PIDF-LO is used by the LIS; other PIDF-LO fields SHOULD be minimally populated.  It is RECOMMENDED that the Device generate an unlinked pseudonym for the <spanx style="verb">entity</spanx> attribute of the presence document to avoid providing identity information.
      </t>

      <t>In providing location information in this manner, the Device implicitly grants the LIS the ability to redistribute location information under the same conditions that apply to the HELD context.
      </t>

        <t>The following summarizes the location capability following the outline from <xref target="defn"/>:

    <section anchor="measurements" title="Location Measurement Capability">
      <t>Measurement data from the Device can be invaluable in improving the quality of location information.  Measurement information from a Device can improve the accuracy of location estimates or enable positioning methods that would not otherwise be available.  See <xref target="I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements"/> for more information on location measurements.  Providing access to measurement data by using the capability exchange makes these advantages available when a location recipient uses a location URI to retrieve location information.
      </t>

      <t>The measurement capability is identified by the URN <spanx style="verb">urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:cap:lm</spanx>.  In addition to this URN, the Device also needs to indicate which measurements it can provide in the capability indication.  This is done by identifying the location measurement element.
      </t>

      <t>The <spanx style="verb">lm</spanx> element includes a qualified element name (using the namespace context of the enclosing document).  This element name identifies a measurement element, as defined by the guidelines in <xref target="I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements"/>.
      </t>

      <t>Inclusion of the <spanx style="verb">lm</spanx> element is only necessary in a capabilities indication, it MAY be omitted from any capabilities agreement or capabilities invocation.
      </t>

      <t>When the LIS invokes this capability, the Device provides location measurements in the HTTP PUT to the specified URI.  This document contains the MIME type <spanx style="verb">application/xml</spanx> [[Ed: probably need to define new MIME type for this]] and has a document element of <spanx style="verb">measurements</spanx>.  This document contains one or more measurement elements containing the requested measurement data.
      </t>

      <t>Multiple measurements can be provided at the same time.  The <spanx style="verb">measurements</spanx> element simply contains multiple measurement elements.  This can be used to simultaneously provide information for multiple different invocations of this capability.
      </t>

      <section title="Location Measurement Capability Summary">
        <t>The following summarizes the location measurement capability following the outline from <xref target="defn"/>:

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The information provided by a Device in the course of responding to a capabilities invocation could be private data.  This information might grant the LIS the ability to locate the Device with greater accuracy than would be otherwise possible.  Furthermore, information about the capabilities of a Device could also be considered sensitive.  A Device SHOULD offer a user the option to suppress some or all capabilities.
      </t>

      <t>Capabilities MUST only be exchanged with the LIS in the scope of a context.  This precaution provides the Device with a means to cancel access to these capabilities at any time.  This can be done by deleting the context, or by indicating an empty set of capabilities to the LIS.
      </t>

      <t>Any information that is provided to the LIS by the Device increases the impact of LIS impersonation.  Measures that mitigate the possibility of impersonation, as outlined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery"/>, are more important for a Device that provides capability information to a LIS.  Protocols used for the exchange of location information or location measurements should also provide protection from eavesdropping.
      </t>

      <t>Responding to a capabilities invocation might require significant investment of time and resources by a Device.  Even the process of monitoring the invocation resource requires substantial effort, with little initial investment.  This could be exploited by a malicious LIS to exhaust batteries of perform other denial of service attacks.  A Device SHOULD limit the resources it makes available to a LIS in relation to capabilities it advertises.
      </t>

      <t>The LIS is responsible for the veracity of location information it provides, even when it relies on information that comes from the Device.  This considerations described in <xref target="I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements"/> apply to all Device-provided information.
      </t>

      <t>Server authentication for all stages of the process are important, not only for the HELD <spanx style="verb">createContext</spanx> request, but also for retrieving the capabilities invocation and publishing the requested information.  These resources do no need to be provided by the same server, but each resource MUST be authenticated based on the domain name in the URI, if possible.  <xref target="RFC2818">HTTP over TLS</xref> is strongly RECOMMENDED for each of these exchanges.
      </t>

      <section title="URI Secrecy">
        <t>Using capabilities offers attackers a means to provide invalid location or measurement data.  The URI offered by the LIS for receiving location or measurement data is not authorized.  If an attacker knows this URI, they are able to provide misleading information that could be used by the LIS.
        </t>

        <t>The only protection provided is secrecy.  Only the Device is given the URI to the invocation resource, which is where the URI used for providing information is made available.  To guarantee this secrecy, the URI of the invocation resource and any URIs contained therein need to be difficult to acquire or guess.
        </t>

        <t>The LIS MUST use confidentiality protection on the channel it uses to provide these two resources.  <xref target="RFC2818">HTTP over TLS</xref> MUST be used unless confidentiality can be guaranteed by other means.
        </t>

        <t>To make guessing more difficult, these URIs MUST include sufficient randomness.  The LIS SHOULD also periodically change the URIs it provides to limit any exposure in the case that these URIs become known to an attacker.
