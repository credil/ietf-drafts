            Happy Eyeballs Extension for Multiple Interfaces
               draft-chen-mif-happy-eyeballs-extension-00

Abstract

   The memo has been proposed to extend happy eyeballs algorithm to fit
   into multiple interfaces environment.  Based on this extended
   heuristic algorithm, a client with multiple interface could determine
   the optimal flow path in which specific interface has been chosen.
   Furthermore, an appropriate IP address family for each interface can
   be also identified to guarantee user experiences during IPv6
   transition period.

1.  Introduction

   In multiple interface context, the problems raised by hosts with
   multiple interfaces have been discussed.  The MIF problem
   statement[MIF-PS] has described the various issues when using a MIF
   node on which multiple interfaces are used and results in wrong
   domain selection.  Happy Eyeballs [HAPPY-EYEBALLS] has described how
   a dual-stack client can determine the functioning path to a dual-
   stack server.  It's using heuristic algorithm help applications to
   quickly determine if IPv6 or IPv4 is the most optimal to connect to a
   server.  That is a good practice to achieve intelligent path
   selection.  However, the assumption here is single-homed host.  The
   interaction with multiple interfaces is still waiting for further
   study.

   This memo has been proposed to extend happy eyeballs algorithm to fit
   into multiple interfaces environment.  That could achieve win-win
   situation.  Based on this extended heuristic algorithm, a client with
   multiple interface could determine the optimal flow path in which
   specific interface has been chosen.  Furthermore, an appropriate IP
   address family for each interface can be also identified to guarantee
   user experiences during IPv6 transition period.


2.  Heuristic Happy Eyeballs Extension Algorithm

   The section details extended Happy Eyeballs algorithm, including new
   defined data structure, functionalities and example flow.

2.1.  The Framework for Extended Algorithm

   The Figure 1 shows the proposed framework for extended algorithm.

         Figure 1: Multiple Interface Mode for Extended Algorithm

   Each interface will be configured with weighting coefficient, which
   is composed of pair values.  Apart from value P, which is following
   current definition in [HAPPY-EYEBALLS], value I is defined to
   indicate preference of interfaces selection.  In general, value I is
   responsible for interface selection; value P is a indication to
   identify IPv4 or IPv6 family has been preferred.

2.2.  Algorithm for Interface Selection

   According to the definition, applications will take account of value
   I to identify which interface has been chosen before sending out data
   packages .

   Each interface is configured with one value, I. I is served as an
   indication to identify which interface is preferred for a specific
   destination or hostname.  A positive value indicates preference of
   specific interface compared to others.  The value is justified
   according to TCP establishment duration.  The detailed flow can be
   found in 2.4.  The rule here is that shorter is winner.  When one
   interface defeats others, the corresponding value I will be set to
   positive value.  Other interfaces will be set negative value orderly
   according to caused time for TCP connection, like -1, -2, etc.  A
   value of 0 indicates equal weight for multiple interfaces.  In this
   case, the heuristic connection is not valid for interface selection.

   After several interface values I have been configured, the traffic
   flow targeted to specific destination address or hostname will follow
   this guidance to choose proper interface.  When connection problems
   are occurred to preferred connection, the value I need to be
   adjusted.  The adjustment of value I will do polling-based scheme.
   the value I corresponding to suboptimal interface will be configured
   as positive.  And previously optimal value I will be set to most-
   negative.

2.3.  IPv4/IPv6 Selection Algorithm for Individual Interface

   for a specific interface, the choice of IP address family relies on
   Happy Eyeballs algorithm, which defined in [HAPPY-EYEBALLS].

2.4.  Example of Extended Algorithm

   The Figure 2 shows example flow for algorithm implemetation,in which
   a host with three interfaces is demonstrated.  It's easy to apply
   that to more interfaces situation.

                Figure 2: Example of Algorithm Execution

   Above example of algorithm execution emphasizes on the computation of
   coefficient value I. The value P will be calculated as defined in
   [HAPPY-EYEBALLS].

   When client initiates application session, multiple interfaces will
   do DNS query simultaneously.  As a results, DNS server will return IP
   address related to requested FQDN, as shown from step 1 to 6.
   Afterwards, three interfaces are trying to establish TCP connection
   with remote peer IP address synchronously as shown from step 7 to 15.
   In this example, interface 1 competes with another two and firstly
   finish TCP connection.  So value I will be set to 1.  And second one
   is set to -1; thelast one is set to -2.  The interface 2 and 3 will
   then send RST to remote IP peer for release TCP sessions.

   Through the whole process, interface 1 will be set to most-preferred
   interface for a specific this particular destination or hostname. if
   there is an accidental connection problem has occurred, the value I
   with interface 1 will be set to -2.  And the values I related to
   interface 2 and 3 will increase sequentially to be set to 1 and -1.
   Subsequent traffic will take interface 2 as preferred interface for
   traffic delivery.

3.  Additional Considerations

3.1.  Usage Scope

   Happy Eyeballs is trageting to HTTP context, but it is useful and
   applicable to other time-sensitive applications.

3.2.  Flow Continuity

   Usually, interface changing is happened at beginning of new session.
   So, there is no flow continuity issues for ongoing TCP sesson.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   TBD
