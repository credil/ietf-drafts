    <abstract>
      <t>This draft describes a mechanism for use in conjunction with link
      state routing protocols which prevents the transient loops which would
      otherwise occur during topology changes. It does this by correctly
      sequencing the FIB updates on the routers.</t>

      <t>This mechanism can be used in the case of non-urgent link or node
      shutdowns and restarts or link metric changes. It can also be used in
      conjunction with a FRR mechanism which converts a sudden link or node
      failure into a non-urgent topology change. This is possible where a
      complete repair path is provided for all affected destinations.</t>

      <t>After a non-urgent topology change, each router computes a rank that
      defines the time at which it can safely update its FIB. A method for
      accelerating this loop-free convergence process by the use of completion
      messages is also described.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>With link-state protocols, such as IS-IS <xref
      target="ISO10589"></xref> and OSPF <xref target="RFC2328"></xref>, each
      time the network topology changes, some routers need to modify their
      Forwarding Information Base (FIB) to take into account the new topology.
      Each topology change causes a convergence phase. During this phase,
      routers may transiently have inconsistent FIBs, which may lead to packet
      loops and losses, even if the reachability of the destinations is not
      compromised after the topology change. Packet losses and transient loops
      can also occur in the case of a link down event implied by a maintenance
      operation, even if this operation is predictable and not urgent. When
      the link state change is a metric update and when a new link is brought
      up in the network, there is no direct loss of connectivity, but
      transient packet loops and loss can still occur.</t>

      <t><t> For example, in <xref target="fig.example" />, if the link
      between X and Y is shut down by an operator, packets destined to X can
      loop between R and Y when Y has updated its FIB while R has not yet
      updated its FIB, and packets destined to Y can loop between X and S if X
      updates its FIB before S. According to the current behaviour of ISIS and
      OSPF, this scenario will happen most of the time because X and Y are the
      first routers to be aware of the failure, so that they will update their
      FIBs first.</t> <figure anchor="fig.example" title="A simple topology">

      <t>It should be noted that the loops can occur remotely from the
      failure, not just adjacent to it.</t>

      <t>The goal of this draft is to define a mechanism which sequences the
      router FIB updates to maintain consistency throughout the network. By
      correctly setting the FIB change order no looping or packet loss can
      occur. This mechanism may be applied to the case of managed link-state
      changes, i.e. link metric change, manual link down/up, manual router
      down/up, and managed state changes of a set of links attached to one
      router. It may also be applied to the case where one or more network
      elements are protected by a fast re-route mechanism <xref
      target="RFC5714"></xref> <xref target="RFC4090"></xref>. The mechanisms
      that are used in the failure case are exactly the same as those used for
      managed changes. For simplicity this draft makes no further distinction
      between managed and unplanned changes.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec.ordering" title="The required FIB update order">
      <t>This section provides an overview of the required ordering of the FIB
      updates. A more detailed analysis of the rerouting dynamics and
      correctness proofs of the mechanism can be found in <xref
      target="refs.PFOB07"></xref>.</t>

      <section anchor="sec.ordering.single" title="Single Link Events">
        <t>For simplicity the correct ordering for single link changes are
        described first. The draft then builds on this to demonstrate that the
        same principles can be applied to more complex scenarios such as line
        card or node changes.</t>

        <section anchor="sec.ordering.single.down"
                 title="Link Down / Metric Increase">
          <t>First consider the non-urgent failure of a link or the increase
          of a link metric. In this case, a router R MUST NOT update its FIB
          until all other routers that send traffic via R and the affected
          link have first updated their FIBs.</t>

          <t>The following argument shows that this rule ensures the correct
          order of FIB change when the link X-&gt;Y is shut down or its metric
          is increased.</t>

          <t>An "outdated" FIB entry for a destination is defined as being a
          FIB entry that still reflects the shortest path(s) in use before the
          topology change. Once a packet reaches a router R that has an
          outdated FIB entry for the packet destination, then, provided the
          oFIB ordering is respected, the packet will continue to X only
          traversing routers that also have an outdated FIB entry for the
          destination. The packet thus reaches X without looping and will be
          forwarded to Y via X-&gt;Y (or in the case of FRR, the X-&gt;Y
          repair path) and hence reach its destination.</t>

          <t>Since it can be assumed that the original topology was loop-free,
          Y will never use the link Y-&gt;X to reach the destination and hence
          the path(s) between Y and the destination are guaranteed to be
          unaffected by the topology change. It therefore follows that the
          packet arriving at Y will reach its destination without looping.</t>

          <t>Since it can also be assumed that the new topology is loop-free,
          by definition a packet cannot loop while being forwarded exclusively
          by routers with an updated FIB entry.</t>

          <t>In other words, when the oFIB ordering is respected, if a packet
          reaches an outdated router, it can never subsequently reach an
          updated router, and cannot loop because from this point on it will
          only be forwarded on the consistent path that was used before the
          event. If it does not reach an outdated router, it will only be
          forwarded on the loop free path that will be used after the
          convergence.</t>

          <t>According to the proposed ordering, X will be the last router to
          update its FIB. Once it has updated its FIB, the link X-&gt;Y can
          actually be shut down (or the repair removed).</t>

          <t>If the link X-Y is bidirectional a similar process must be run to
          order the FIB update for destinations using the link in the
          direction Y-&gt;X. As has already been shown, no packet ever
          traverses the X-Y link in both directions, and hence the operation
          of the two ordering processes is orthogonal.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="sec.ordering.single.up"
                 title="Link Up / Metric Decrease">
          <t>In the case of link up events or metric decreases, a router R
          MUST update its FIB BEFORE all other routers that WILL use R to
          reach the affected link.</t>

          <t>The following argument shows that this rule ensures the correct
          order of FIB change when the link X-&gt;Y is brought into service or
          its metric is decreased.</t>

          <t>Firstly, when a packet reaches a router R that has already
          updated its FIB, all the routers on the path from R to X will also
          have updated their FIB, so that the packet will reach X and be
          forwarded along X-&gt;Y, ultimately reaching its destination.</t>

          <t>Secondly, a packet cannot loop between routers that have not yet
          updated their FIB. This proves that no packet can loop.</t>

      <section anchor="sec.ordering.multilink" title="Multi-link events">
        <t>The following sections describe the required ordering for single
        events which may be manifest as multiple link events. For example, the
        failure of a router may be notified to the rest of the network as the
        individual failure of all its attached links. The means of identifying
        the event type from the collection of received link events is
        described in <xref target="sec.deducing"></xref>.</t>

        <!--		<t>Topological events can affect the state of a set of links.
		Some of those events are sometimes caused by maintenance
		operations. For example, a router shutdown or a linecard
		removal is a predictable operation that should not cause packet
		losses or transient loops. Quite similarly, when a router is
		brought up in the network or a linecard is set up, no transient
		forwarding loops should be possible.</t>

		<t>When a set of links is affected by a non-urgent event, it is
		possible that a few LSPs are required to fully describe the
		topological change. For example, in the case of a router up
		event, the LSPs of the router coming up and the LSP of its
		neighbours are required to consider the links as being up.
		Another example is the case where a router is shut down and has
		not the opportunity to send a LSP to describe the failure of
		all its links. To solve that issue, a router that receives a
		LSP describing a non-urgent event SHOULD wait a period of time
		to be able to detect the whole description of the event and
		find out that this is an event concerning links that have one
		node in common.</t>-->

        <!--.\"It must be noted that all those events affecting sets of
		links have .\"the particularity that all the affected links
		have one node in common, and that .\"the link-state packet
		advertised by the common node is sufficient to describe .\"the
		complete topological change.-->

        <section anchor="sec.ordering.linecard.router.down"
                 title="Router Down events">
          <t>In the case of the non-urgent shut-down of a router, a router R
          MUST NOT update its FIB until all other routers that send traffic
          via R and the affected router have first updated their FIBs.</t>

          <t>Using a proof similar to that for link failure, it can be shown
          that no loops will occur if this ordering is respected <xref
          target="refs.PFOB07"></xref>.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="sec.ordering.linecard.router.up"
                 title="Router Up events">
          <t>In the case of a router being brought into service, a router R
          MUST update its FIB BEFORE all other routers that WILL use R to
          reach the affected router.</t>

          <t>A proof similar to that for link up, shows that no loops will
          occur if this ordering is respected <xref
          target="refs.PFOB07"></xref>.</t>

          <!--.

\"In IS-IS, when a router X is brought up, it usually sends its link-state packet with the overload bit set. 
.\"After a while, each of its neighbours will have sent a link-state packet describing their links to X as
.\"being up. At that moment, X can send a link-state packet with an overload bit unset, so that
.\"the processing of this link-state packet by the other routers will make them consider all the links 
.\"connected to X as being up, in one single FIB update.
.\" In OSPF, the overload-bit does not exists. An OSPF router that is brought up should thus wait
.\" for a while before sending its own LSA, or firstly send its LSA with a MAX-METRIC assigned
.\" to each of its links, and only send a LSA with the real metrics after a while.
.\"By proceeding like this, we have the opportunity to order those FIB updates and avoid forwarding
.\"inconsistencies during the convergence.

		<t>The ordering of the FIB updates follows a rule that is very
		similar to the rule mentioned in the case of a link up event. A
		router R should update its FIB BEFORE all the routers that WILL
		use R to reach the router that is brought up.</t>

		<t>Let us show that this ordering ensures the transient
		consistency of the forwarding.  We assume that the router X
		comes in the network. </t>

		<t>Firstly, when a packet with destination D reaches a router R
		that has already updated its FIB, and that uses X to reach D,
		the packet will reach X as it will traverse routers that have
		already updated their FIB. X will then forward the packet to
		its nexthop for destination D. The path from this nexthop to D
		cannot contain X, so that the packet is proved to be
		consistently forwarded to D.  Secondly, a packet that
		exclusively traverses routers with an outdated FIB cannot loop.
		Otherwise, there was a permanent loop before the event.</t>

          <t>The failure of a line card involves the failure of a set of links

      <section anchor="sec.deducing" title="Deducing the topology change">
        <t>As has been described, a single event such as the failure or
        restoration of a single link, single router or a linecard may be
        notified to the rest of the network as a set of individual link change
        events. It is necessary to deduce from this collection of link state
        notifications the type of event that has occurred in the network and
        hence the required ordering.</t>

        <t>When a link change event is received which impacts the receiving
        router's FIB, the routers at the near and far end of the link are
        noted.</t>

        <t>If all events received within some hold-down period have a single
        router (R) in common, then it is assumed that the change reflects an
        event (line-card or router change) concerning the common router
        (R).</t>

        <t>In the case of a link change event, the router at the far end of
        the link is deemed to be the common router (R).</t>

        <t>All ordering computations are based on treating the common router R
        as the root for both link and node events.</t>

      <section anchor="sec.deciding"
               title="Deciding if ordered FIB updates applies">
        <t>There are some events (for example a subsequent failure with
        conflicting repair requirements occurring before the ordered FIB
        process has completed) that cannot be correctly processed by this
        mechanism. In these cases it is necessary to ensure that convergence
        falls back to the conventional mode of operation (see <xref
        target="sec.fallback"></xref>).</t>

        <t>In all cases it is necessary to wait some hold-down period after
        receiving the first notification to ensure that all routers have
        received the complete set of link state notifications associated with
        the single event.</t>

        <t>At any time, if a link change notification is received which would
        have no effect on the receiving router's FIB, then it may be
        ignored.</t>

        <t>If no other event is received during the hold-down time, the event
        is treated as a link event. Note that the reverse connectivity check
        means that only the first failure event, or second up event have an
        effect on the FIB.</t>

        <t>If an event is received within the hold down period which does NOT
        reference the common router (R) then in this version of the
        specification normal convergence is invoked immediately (see <xref
        target="sec.fallback"></xref>).</t>

        <t>The sudden failure of a link or a set of links that are not
        protected using a FRR mechanism must be processed using the
        conventional mode of operation.</t>

        <t>In summary an ordered FIB process is applicable iif the set of link
        state notifications received between the first event and the hold down
        period reference a common router R, and one of the following
        assertions is verified : <list style="empty">
            <t>. The set of notifications refer to link down events concerning
            protected links and metric increase events</t>

        be used to determine the time at which they are permitted to perform
        their FIB update. In the case of a failure event rooted at router Y or
        an increase of the metric of link X-&gt;Y, router R computes the
        reverse Shortest Path Tree in the topology before the failure
        (rSPT_OLD) rooted at Y. This rSPT gives the shortest paths to reach Y
        before the failure. The branch of the reverse SPT that is below R
        corresponds to the set of shortest paths to R that are used by the
        routers that reach Y via R.</t>

        <t>The rank of router R is defined as the depth (in number of hops) of
        this branch. In the case of ECMP, the maximum depth of the ECMP path
        set is used.</t>

        <t>Router R is required to update its FIB at time</t>

        <t>T0 + H + rank * MAX_FIB</t>

        <t>where T0 is the arrival time of the link-state packet containing
        the topology change, H is the hold-down time and MAX_FIB is a
        network-wide constant that reflects the maximum time required to
        update a FIB irrespective of the change required. The value of MAX_FIB
        is network specific and its determination is out of the scope of this
        document. This value must be agreed by all the routers in the network.
        This agreement can be performed by using a capability TLV as defined
        in <xref target="I-D.atlas-bryant-shand-lf-timers"></xref>.</t>

        <t>All the routers that use R to reach Y will compute a lower rank
        than R, and hence the correct order will be respected. It should be
        noted that only the routers that used Y before the event need to
        compute their rank.</t>

      <section anchor="sec.implementation.up"
               title="Link or Router Up or Metric Decrease">
        <t>In the case of a link or router up event rooted at Y or a link
        metric decrease affecting link Y-&gt;W, a router R must have a rank
        that is higher than the rank of the routers that it will use to reach
        Y, according to the rule described in <xref
        target="sec.ordering"></xref>. The rank of R is thus the number of
        hops between R and Y in its renewed Shortest Path Tree. When R has
        multiple equal cost paths to Y, the rank is the length in hops of the
        longest ECMP path to Y.</t>

        <t>Router R is required to update its FIB at time</t>

        <t>T0 + H + rank * MAX_FIB</t>

        <t>It should be noted that only the routers that use Y after the event
        have to compute a rank, i.e. only the routers that have Y in their SPT
        after the link-state change.</t>

    <section anchor="sec.completion"
             title="Acceleration of Ordered Convergence">
      <t>The mechanism described above is conservative, and hence may be
      relatively slow. The purpose of this section is to describe a method of
      accelerating the controlled convergence in such a way that ordered
      loop-free convergence is still guaranteed.</t>

      <t>In many cases a router will complete its required FIB changes in a
      time much shorter than MAX_FIB and in many other cases, a router will
      not have to perform any FIB change at all.</t>

      <t>This section describes the use of completion messages to speed up the
      convergence by providing a means for a router to inform those routers
      waiting for it, that it has completed any required FIB changes. When a
      router has been advised of completion by all the routers for which it is
      waiting, it can safely update its own FIB without further delay. In most
      cases this can result in a sub-second re-convergence time comparable
      with that of normal convergence.</t>

      <t>Routers maintain a waiting list of the neighbours from which a
      completion message must be received. Upon reception of a completion
      message from a neighbour, a router removes this neighbour from its
      waiting list. Once its waiting list becomes empty, the router is allowed
      to update its FIB immediately even if its ranking timer has not yet
      expired. Once this is done, the router sends a completion message to the
      neighbours that are waiting for it to complete. Those routers are listed
      in a list called the Notification List. Completion messages contain an
      identification of the event to which they refer.</t>

      <t>Note that, since this is only an optimization, any loss of completion
      messages will result in the routers waiting their defined ranking time
      and hence the loop-free properties will be preserved.</t>

      <section anchor="sec.completion.construction"
               title="Construction of the waiting list and notification list">
        <section anchor="sec.completion.construction.down" title="Down events">
          <t>Consider a link or node down event rooted at router Y or the cost
          increase of the link X-&gt;Y. A router R will compute rSPT_OLD(Y) to
          determine its rank. When doing this, R also computes the set of
          neighbors that R uses to reach the failing node or link, and the set
          of neighbors that are using R to reach the failing node or link. The
          Notification list of R is equal to the former set and the Waiting
          list of R is equal to the latter.</t>

          <t>Note that R could include all its neighbors except those in the
          Waiting list in the Notification list, this has no impact on the
          correctness of the protocol, but would be unnecessarily
          inefficient.</t>

          (SPT_new(R)). The Waiting list is the set of nexthop routers that R
          uses to reach Y in SPT_new(R).</t>

          <t>In a simple implementation the notification list of R is all the
          neighbours of R excluding those in the Waiting list. This may be
          further optimized by computing rSPT_new(Y) to determine those
          routers that are waiting for R to complete.</t>
