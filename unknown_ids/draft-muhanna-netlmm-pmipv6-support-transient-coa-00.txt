2.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility protocol which provides
   IP mobility for a regular IPv6 mobile node without the involvement of
   the IPv6 host.  Whenever a mobile node is attached to a PMIPv6 domain
   via a mobility access gateway, MAG, it appears to the mobile node as
   if it is attached to the same home link and thus the mobile node may
   think that it is not roaming away from home.  In the case of mobile
   node active handoff between two different MAGs, the target MAG
   usually sends a proxy BU message to the mobile node local mobility
   anchor to update the mobile node BCE with a new care-of address.  As
   soon as the LMA receives and successfully process the proxy BU from
   the target MAG, LMA updates the mobile node BCE with the new care of
   address and starts sending the mobile node downlink traffic to the
   new care of address hosted at the target MAG and forward all of the
   mobile node uplink reverse IP traffic to the internet as long as it
   comes from the new care of address.  However, during active handoff
   scenario, some of the mobile node uplink traffic may be still in
   transient through the previous MAG.  Currently, the LMA forwards a
   mobile node reverse uplink traffic to the internet as long as the
   following two conditions are met:

   o  The mobile node has an active BCE with its current care of
      address.

   o  The uplink traffic is received from the care of address saved in
      the mobile node BCE.


   This document defines a mechanism which allows Proxy MIPv6 to support
   a transient care-of address registration which enables the mobile
   access gateway to register an address as a transient proxy care-of
   address for a short period of time during inter-MAG active handoff.
   This new transient registration will enable the LMA to receive uplink
   traffic for the same MN from two different MAGs at the same time.  As
   soon as inter-MAG handoff is complete, the mobile node BCE will be
   updated to reflect the latest mobile node care of address and the

   transient pCoA will be removed from the binding cache.


3.  Transient Care of Address Registration Procedure

   When the target MAG sends a PBU for the new MN that attaches it sets
   a new value (6: Handoff with transient uplink) in the Handoff
   Indicator field in the PBU.  When the LMA receives this PBU, it
   creates a new BCE entry with a new bit called the "Transient bit".
   The LMA responds with a PBA message containing the same handoff
   indicator value.  If the LMA is not capable of performing transient
   registrations it can ignore the transient registration and instead
   process the message as if it contained the HI value of 3 (Handoff
   between mobile access gateways for the same interface).


4.  LMA Operation with transient binding cache entries

   When an uplink packet is received from the MN through the target MAG,
   the LMA MUST verify if the source address of the packet (i.e. the
   pCoA of the target MAG) matches the transient pCoA.  If the address
   matches, the LMA MUST consider the packet to be valid and MUST
   forward the packet appropriately based on the contents of the
   decapsulated packet.  The LMA SHOULD NOT use the transient binding
   cache entries for sending out downlink traffic to the MN through the
   target MAG.


5.  Removal of transient binding cache entries

   The transient binding cache entry, which was created by the procedure
   described in this document, needs to be short lived. i.e. for the
   duration of the handover.  After the handover completes, this entry
   needs to either be removed or promoted to a full blown binding cache
   entry.  There are three ways by which this can happen

   1.  The target MAG sends a new PBU with HI value 3 (Handoff between
       mobile access gateways for the same interface): The transient
       binding cache entry is converted into a full blown binding cache
       entry and the BCE for the old MAG is removed

   2.  The old MAG sends a deregistraion PBU: The transient binding
       cache entry is converted into a full blown binding cache entry
       and the BCE for the old MAG is removed

   3.  A configurable timer expires: The transient binding cache entry
       is converted into a full blown binding cache entry and the BCE
       for the old MAG is removed

Internet-Draft        PMIPv6 Transient Registration        February 2008


   Alternately, if none of these happen, the transient binding cache
   entry can simply be removed after a configurable timer expires.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA interaction.




7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not present any new security requirement on the
   top of the security requirements listed in [PMIPv6-Base].  It only
   present an a mechanism to allow a mobile node to be transitionally
   multihomed at two care of addresses during an inter-MAG active
   handoff using the same security requirements as per [PMIPv6-Base].
