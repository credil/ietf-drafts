<abstract>
<t>	
Full internationalization of electronic mail requires not only the
capabilities to transmit non-ASCII content, to encode selected
information in specific header fields, and to use non-ASCII
characters in envelope addresses. It also requires being able to
express those addresses and the information based on them in mail header fields.
This document specifies a variant of Internet mail that 
permits the use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8, rather than ASCII, as the base
form for Internet email header field.  This form is permitted in 
transmission only if authorized by an SMTP extension, as specified in an 
associated specification. This specification updates Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC2045"/>
to conform with the requirements.

This document updates Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC2045" />. It removes the blanket 
ban on applying a content-transfer-encoding to all subtypes of message/  
and instead specifies that a composite subtype MAY specify whether or 
not a content-transfer-encoding can be used for that subtype, with 
"cannot be used" as the default.

<!--
****************
* Sections 1.2 and 4.2

=> I do not find it satisfying to read "message/." at the end of
   a sentence.  I believe it should be quoted.  RFC 2045 uses
   quotes for "message/rfc822".
   Anyway, it is just a remark, and it should be homogenized
   according to the current trend for that.

It Extended mailbox address syntax to permit UTF-8 character in <xref target="syntax_change" />.

<section title="Background and History">
<t>Mailbox names often represent the names of human users. Many of these
users throughout the world have names that are not normally expressed
with just the ASCII repertoire of characters, and would like to use more
or less their real names in their mailbox names. These users
are also likely to use non-ASCII text in their display<!-- common --> names and subjects
of email messages, both received and sent.
This protocol specifies UTF-8 as the encoding to represent email header field bodies.</t>

<t>The traditional format of email messages

<xref target="RFC5322"/> allows only ASCII characters in the
header fields of messages. This prevents users from having email addresses
that contain non-ASCII characters. It further forces non-ASCII text in
display <!-- common--> names, comments, and in free text (such as in the "Subject:" field)
to be encoded (as required by MIME format <xref target="RFC2047" />). This 
specification describes a change to the email message format that is related
to the SMTP message transport change described in the  associated documents
<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis"/>, and that
allows non-ASCII characters in most email header fields. These changes affect 
SMTP clients, SMTP servers, mail user agents (MUAs), list expanders, 
gateways to other media, and all other processes that parse or handle 
email messages.</t>

<t>As specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis"/>,
an SMTP protocol extension "UTF8SMTP" is used to prevent the
transmission of messages with UTF-8 header fields to systems that
cannot handle such messages. 
<!--
[[Note in Draft: Keyword related to UTF8SMTP  will be decided by WG before publication.]]
-->

</t>

<t>
Use of this SMTP extension helps prevent the introduction of such
messages into message stores that might misinterpret, improperly display,
or mangle such messages. It should be noted that using an ESMTP extension
does not prevent transferring email messages with UTF-8 header fields to 
other systems that use the email format for messages and that may not be 
upgraded,  such as unextended POP and IMAP servers. Changes to these 
protocols to handle UTF-8 header fields are addressed in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5721bis" /> and 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-5378bis" />.


</t>

<t>The objective for this protocol is to allow UTF-8 in email header fields.
<!--
    Issues such as how to handle messages containing UTF-8 header fields that
    have to be delivered to systems that have not been upgraded to support
    this capability are discussed in <xref target="RFC5504"/>.

</t>

</section>

<section title="Terminology">
<t>
A plain ASCII string is full compatible with <xref target="RFC5321" /> and <xref target="RFC5322" />. 
In this document, non-ASCII strings are UTF-8 strings if they are in header which contain at least one &lt;UTF8-non-ascii&gt;.

<!-- Original paragraph 
A plain ASCII string is also a valid UTF-8 string; see <xref target="RFC3629"/>.
In this document, ordinary ASCII characters are UTF-8 characters
if they are in headers which contain &lt;UTF8-non-ascii&gt;s.</t>
-->
</t>
<t>
Unless otherwise noted, all terms used here are defined in
<xref target="RFC5321"/>, <xref target="RFC5322"/>, 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis" />, or <xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5336bis"/>.

</section>


<section title="Changes on Message Header Fields">
<t>SMTP clients can send header fields in UTF-8 format, if the 
UTF8SMTP extension is advertised by the SMTP server or is permitted by other 
transport mechanisms. </t>

<t>

This protocol does NOT change the <xref target="RFC5322"/> rules for defining header field 
names. The bodies of header fields are allowed to contain UTF-8 characters, 
but the header field names themselves must contain only ASCII characters.
</t>
<t>
To permit UTF-8 characters in field values, the header definition in 
<xref target="RFC5322"/> is extended to support the new format.
The following ABNF is defined to substitute those definitions in <xref target="RFC5322"/>.
</t>
<t>
	The syntax rules not covered in this section remain as defined in <xref target="RFC5322"/>.
</t>

<section title="UTF-8 Syntax and Normalization">
<t>UTF-8 characters can be defined in terms of octets using the following 
ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/>, taken from <xref target="RFC3629"/>:
<figure>
  <artwork><![CDATA[

UTF8-non-ascii  =   UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4

UTF8-2          =   <See Section 4 of RFC3629>

UTF8-3          =   <See Section 4 of RFC3629>
					
UTF8-4          =   <See Section 4 of RFC3629>
  ]]></artwork>
</figure>

</t>	
<t>	
See <xref target="RFC5198"/> for a discussion of normalization; the use of normalization form 
<xref target="NFC" /> is RECOMMENDED. Actually, if one is going to do internationalization properly, one of 
the most often-cited goals is to permit people to spell their names correctly. Since many 
mailbox local parts reflect personal names, that principle applies as well. And NFKC is 
not recommended because it may lose information that is needed to correctly spell some names <!-- except -->in unusual circumstances.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Changes on MIME Headers" anchor="change_on_mime_header">
<t>
   This specification updates Section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC2045"/>. 
   <xref target="RFC2045"/> prohibits applying a content-transfer-encoding  
   to any subtypes of "message/".  This specification relaxes the rule -- it allows
   newly defined MIME types to permit content-transfer-encoding, and it allows
   content-transfer-encoding for message/global (see <xref target="utf8smtp"/>).
</t>



<t>
   Background: Normally, transfer of message/global will be done in
   8-bit-clean channels, and body parts will have "identity" encodings,
   that is, no decoding is necessary.

   In the case where a message containing a message/global is downgraded
   from 8-bit to 7-bit as described in <xref target="RFC1652"/>, an encoding
   may be applied to the message; if the message travels multiple times 
   between a 7-bit environment and an environment implementing UTF8SMTP,
   multiple levels of encoding may occur. This is expected to be rarely 
   seen in practice, and the potential complexity of other ways of dealing
   with the issue are thought to be larger than the complexity of allowing 
   nested encodings where necessary.
</t>

</section>
<section title="Syntax Extensions to RFC 5322" anchor="syntax_change">
<t>The following rules are intended to extend the corresponding rules in 
<xref target="RFC5322"/> in order to allow UTF-8 characters.
<figure>

</figure>
This means that all the <xref target="RFC5322"/> constructs that build upon these will
permit UTF-8 characters, including comments and quoted strings. We do not change the syntax 
of &lt;atext&gt; in order to allow UTF-8 characters in &lt;addr-spec&gt;.  This would 
also allow UTF-8 characters in &lt;message-id&gt;, which is not allowed due to the limitation 
described in <xref target="TraceFieldLimit" />. Instead, &lt;uAtext&gt; is added to meet this requirement.

To allow the use of UTF-8 in a Content-Description header field 
<xref target="RFC2045" />, the following syntax is used:
<!--

-->
The &lt;uText&gt;  syntax is extended above to allow UTF-8 in all &lt;description&gt; header fields.</t> 
<t>
Note, however, this does not remove any constraint on the character set of protocol elements;
for instance, all the allowed values for timezone in the "Date:" header fields are still expressed in ASCII. 
And also, none of this revised syntax changes what is allowed in a &lt;msg-id&gt;, which will still remain in pure ASCII.

message/global body part as an unknown attachment, while they will 
understand the structure of a message/rfc822.  However, systems that
understand message/global will provide functionality superior to the 
result of a down-conversion to message/rfc822.  The most interoperable 
choice depends on the deployed software.</t>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
<t>
	If a user has a non-ASCII mailbox address and an ASCII mailbox
	address, a digital certificate that identifies that user may have
	both addresses in the identity. Having multiple email addresses as
	identities in a single certificate is already supported in
	PKIX (Public Key Infrastructure for X.509 Certificates) <xref target="RFC5280" /> 
	and OpenPGP <xref target="RFC3156" />.	
</t>
<t>
	Because UTF-8 often requires several octets to encode a single character, 
	internationalized local parts and header value may cause mail addresses to
	become longer. As specified in <xref target="RFC5322"/>, each line of 
	characters MUST be no more 998 octets, excluding the CRLF. On the other 
	hand, MDA (Mail Delivery Agent) processes that parse, store, or handle email 
	addresses or local parts must take extra care not to overflow buffers, 
	truncate addresses,	or exceed storage allotments. Also, they must take care, 
	when comparing, to use the entire lengths of the addresses.

<t>
	In this specification, a user could provide an ASCII alternative address 
	for a non-ASCII address. However, it is possible these two addresses go to 
	different mailboxes, or even different people. 
	This configuration may be based on a user's personal choice or on
	administration policy. We recognize that if ASCII and non-ASCII email is
	delivered to two different destinations, based on MTA capability, this may
	violate the principle of least astonishment, but this is not a "protocol problem".
</t>

<t>

The security impact of UTF-8 headers on email signature systems such as 
Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), S/MIME, and OpenPGP is discussed in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-frmwrk-4952bis"/>, Section 14.  
<!--
A subsequent 
document <xref target="RFC5504"/> will cover the impact of downgrading on 
these systems.
