<abstract>
	<t>This document updates RFC 3777, Section 3, Bullet 6 to allow a Nominating and Recall
		Commitee to disclose the list of volunteers who are willing to serve in 
		positions the NomCom is responsible for filling.
	</t>
</abstract>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

	<t>The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), 
		and at-large IETF representatives to the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) are 
		selected by a "Nominating and Recall Committee" (universally abbreviated as "NomCom").
		<xref target='RFC3777' /> defines how the NomCom is selected, and the processes it follows as
		it selects candidates for these positions.
	</t>

	<t>The NomCom is responsible for filling positions across the breadth of the Internet Engineering
		Task Force (IETF). The NomCom needs relevant information about candidates being considered
		for these positions, but current <xref target='RFC3777' /> requirements for confidentiality
		limit the ability of the NomCom to solicit that information. The process change described in
		this document allows the 
		NomCom to openly solicit information about willing candidates.
	</t>

</section>

<section anchor="background" title="Background of this document" >

	<t><xref target='RFC3777' /> is the latest in a series of revisions to the NomCom process. 
	</t>

	<t><xref target='RFC3777' /> describes the confidental nature of NomCom deliberations in
		section 3, "General", bullet 6, which states:
	</t>

	<t><list><t>All deliberations and supporting information that relates to
      			specific nominees, candidates, and confirmed candidates are
      			confidential.
			<vspace blankLines='1' />
		</t>
		
		<t>The nominating committee and confirming body members will be
     			exposed to confidential information as a result of their
     			deliberations, their interactions with those they consult, and
      			from those who provide requested supporting information.  All
      			members and all other participants are expected to handle this
      			information in a manner consistent with its sensitivity.
			<vspace blankLines='1' />
		</t>
		
		<t>It is consistent with this rule for current nominating committee
      			members who have served on prior nominating committees to advise
      			the current committee on deliberations and results of the prior
      			committee, as necessary and appropriate.
		</t>
	</list></t>

	<t>Since at least 1996, most NomComs have sent out a "short list" of candidates under consideration
		to a variety of audiences. The target audiences differ from year to year, but have included
		members of specific leadership bodies, working group chairs in
		a specific area (for IESG positions), and all working group chairs 
		(for IAB and IAOC positions).
	</t>
	
	<t>This practice is probably unavoidable, but it is periodically 
		challenged because it's not explicitly allowed as 
		an exception to the blanket requirement for confidentiality.
	</t>

	<t>We also note that this practice penalizes IETF participants who aren't members of one of the
		audiences being surveyed - they have no way of knowing who is being considered, other
		than the incumbent(s), 
		and have little incentive to provide feedback on individuals who might not even be 
		candidates.
	</t> 

	<t>In an attempt to maintain the required level of confidentiality, past NomComs have also included
		"ringers" on the short list - candidates who have notified NomCom that they are NOT willing
		to serve. Since anyone who sees the short list does not know who the ringers are, 
		consciencious IETF participants also provide feedback on candidates who have already 
		declined. This is a waste of precious IETF-participant cycles.
	</t>

	<t>The NomCom should be allowed to solicit needed feedback from the community 
		on all candidates who are willing to serve. The community should not waste time providing
		feedback on candidates who are not willing to serve.
	</t>

</section>

<section anchor="discussion" title="Discussion" >

	<t>We take it as given that current NomComs members will not likely have personal experience with
		all candidates for positions under review. 
	</t>

	<t>We assume that asking the larger community for 
		feedback about these candidates is preferable to NomCom members without personal experience 
		simply deferring to the members of the NomCom
		who DO have personal experience with specific candidates. If this assumption holds, the only
		question is how best to ask the community for feedback.
	</t>

	<t>We considered three possibilities:
	</t>

	<t><list style='numbers'>
		<t>Asking for feedback on all candidates, whether they are willing to serve or not.</t>
		<t>Asking for feedback on all candidates who are willing to serve.</t>
		<t>Asking for feedback on the candidates that NomCom is seriously considering (the "short
			list").</t>
	</list></t>

	<t>Asking for feedback on candidates who are not willing to serve is a waste of 
		precious IETF-participant cycles, and may make it less likely that NomCom would receive 
		feedback on some candidates who are willing to serve.
	</t>

	<t>Asking for feedback on all candidates who are willing to serve allows the community to point 
		out specific strengths and weaknesses of all candidates, and this feedback should be useful 
		to NomCom in deciding which candidates to seriously consider. It also ensures that NomCom has 
		feedback on candidates who may not appear on the short list initially, in the event
		that a strong candidate is suddenly unwilling or unable to serve.
	</t>

	<t>We also note that the list of willing candidates would include incumbents who are willing to 
		serve an additional term.
	</t>

	<t>add a fourth paragraph, with the following text:

			The list of candidates published should not contain candidates who
			have not indicated a willingness to serve in the position(s) under
			review.
