Abstract

   This document defines the Proxy-Authentication-Info header field for
   the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  When a UA is required to
   authenticate to a proxy using digest authentication specified in SIP
   this header field allows for the UA to authenticate the proxy,
   enabling mutual authentication.  This header field can also provide
   integrity checks over the bodies.

Internet-Draft     Proxy Mutual Authentication in SIP      February 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP, [RFC3261]) provides a
   stateless, challenge-response based mechanism for authentication that
   is based on authentication in HTTP [RFC2617].  A proxy or a user
   receiving a request can challenge the initiator of the request to
   obtain assurance of the originator's identity.  A UAS, registrar, or
   redirect server can use 401 (Unauthorized), where as proxies use 407
   (Proxy Authentication Required), for authentication challenges.
   Challenges result in a resend of the requests with the digest
   authentication information that can be used to verify the
   authenticity of the originator.  The two parties share a username and
   password to support this authentication mechanism.  Refer to
   [RFC3261] for more information on Digest authentication.

   The SIP Digest mechanism parallels the HTTP Digest mechanism
   specified in [RFC2617].  HTTP Digest [RFC2617] also allows for mutual
   authentication by allowing the client to authenticate the challenging
   entity, such as a proxy.  Mutual authentication is facilitated via
   two headers: Authentication-Info for mutual authentication with a
   server, and Proxy-Authentication-Info for authentication with a
   proxy.  These headers may be used by the challenging entities, server
   or proxy, to send challenge responses for authentication by the
   client.  SIP specifies and allows for the usage of the
   Authentication-Info header by a server, but does not mention the
   Proxy-Authentication-Info header.  This document presents an
   extension to allow for the use of the Proxy-Authentication-Info
   header.  The header can be sent along with 2xx responses from the
   proxy to the client during digest authentication.  The response
   digest in the "response-auth" directive allows the client to
   authenticate the proxy, i.e., it ensures that the proxy has knowledge
   of the password.  This provides for mutual authentication when
   proxies challenge clients, and provides for limited integrity
   protection.  It also allows for the Proxy to provide additional
   information such as the nonce value to use for a future
   authentication response.

           Figure 1: Proxy-to-User Digest Authentication in SIP

   Figure 1 provides a sample message flow when the proxy challenges a
   client's request using digest authentication with SIP.  As
   illustrated, the client sends a request that is challenged by the
   proxy via a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response.  The client
   then uses the information provided in the challenge (refer to
   [RFC3261] for details) to prepare a response (to the challenge).  The
   client then resends the request, and this time it includes the
   challenge response.  If the response to the challenge authenticated
   the client, the proxy replies with a 200 OK.  This allows for the
   proxy to authenticate the client.  However, it neither allows for the
   proxy to send additional information regarding the successful
   authentication such as the nonce to use for a future authentication
   response, nor does it allow for a client to authenticate the proxy.
   This is in contrast to when the challenging entity is a server, since
   it can accomplish both - additional authentication information and
   mutual authentication - via the Authentication-Info header.  This
   document proposes the inclusion of the Proxy-Authentication-Info
   header to address this deficiency in Proxy-to-User authentication.
   The header parallels a header of the same name for HTTP, as specified
   in [RFC2617].  The header is used by the proxy during Proxy-to-User
   authentication to allow for mutual authentication and additional

4.  User Agent Client (UAC) Behavior

   When this header field is included by a Proxy within the 2xx
   response, the requirements are the same as those of a client
   receiving an Authentication-Info header field from a Server, as
   specified in [RFC3261].

6.  Proxy Behavior

   A Proxy MAY include this header field in a 2xx response to a request
   that was successfully authenticated using digest based on the
   Authorization header field.

   Syntax and semantics follow those specified in [RFC2617], which also
   defines mechanisms for backwards compatibility using the qop
   attribute in the request.  These mechanisms MUST be used by a proxy
   to determine if the client supports the new mechanisms in [RFC2617]
   that were not specified in [RFC2069].

   Proxy-Authentication-Info: nextnonce="47364c23432d2e131a5fb210812c

7.  Extensibility Considerations

   This document introduces the Proxy-Authentication-Info header that
   may be sent from a proxy to a client during authentication.  If
   present, it provides an opportunity for the client to authenticate
   the proxy, enabling mutual authentication.  A proxy that is not
   compliant with this specification will not include the header.
   However, implementors need to understand that without the specified
   header mutual authentication may not be possible within Proxy-to-User
   authentication as specified by SIP.  Additionally, the presence of
   this header allows for the proxy to indicate the nonce to be used by
   the client during a future authentication response.  If the nextnonce
   field is present the client SHOULD use it when constructing the
   Proxy-Authorization header for its next request.  This document does
   not alter this requirement.  However, implementers need to understand
   that the failure of the client to act on the nextnonce field may
   result in a request to re-authenticate from the proxy with the
   "stale=TRUE".  This behavior is specified in [RFC2617], and is not
   altered by this document.

8.  Header Field Definition

   The grammar for the Proxy-Authentication-Info header is defined as
   follows:


   Proxy-Authentication-Info = "Proxy-Authentication-Info" HCOLON painfo
                                *(COMMA painfo)
   painfo                    =  nextnonce / message-qop
                                / response-auth / cnonce
                                / nonce-count
   nextnonce                 =  "nextnonce" EQUAL nonce-value
   response-auth             =  "rspauth" EQUAL response-digest
   response-digest           =  LDQUOT *LHEX RDQUOT


   Figure 3 is an extension to Table 3 of [RFC3261] for the Proxy-
   Authentication-Info header:


     Header field                 where    proxy ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG

9.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a SIP message header that provides mutual
   authentication during proxy authentication of a UA.  When challenged
   by a proxy or server to perform authentication (e.g., after sending
   an INVITE or SUBSCRIBE request), the Proxy-Authorization header
   provides the proxy with proof the UA knows the correct credentials
   for the identity being used.  By adding support for the Proxy-
   Authentication-Info header, proxies may provide UAs with a challenge
   response to prove to the UA it also knows the correct credentials.
   The use case most affected is where the proxy/server performing the
   challenge is not the next-hop proxy/server of the UA.

   When the proxy/server is the next-hop proxy/server for the UA, TLS
   should be relied upon instead of this mechanism, as a malicious next-
   hop proxy or Man-in-The-Middle (MITM) could merely not challenge the
   UA, or simply not use the optional Proxy-Authorization-Info header.
   This header is most meaningful in environments where the UA is
   expecting (i.e., is configured) to perform mutual authenitication -
   malicious entities would be forced to prove knowledge of the UAs
   credentials, adding an additional layer of defense.
