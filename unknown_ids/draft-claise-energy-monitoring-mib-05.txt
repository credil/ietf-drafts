     TO DO 
         
          . do we require the ability to have multiple

     1. Introduction 

        Network management is typically divided into areas of concerns 
        according to the ISO Telecommunications Management Network 
        model.  The model defines Fault, Configuration, Accounting, 
        Performance, and Security Management.  Notably missing is an 
        area of concern specifically covering energy management at an 
        equal level to these areas. 
         
        With energy becoming a more critical area of concern, this 
        document defines a subset of the Management Information Base 
        (MIB) for use with devices in and connected to communication 
        networks for energy management.  The MIB modules in this 
        document are designed to provide a model for energy management, 
        which includes monitoring for power state and energy consumption 
        of networked elements.  This MIB takes into account the 
        requirements specified in [POWER-MON-REQ].  
         
        Energy management is applicable to devices that comprise and 
        that are connected to a communication network.  Target devices 
        for this specification include (but are not limited to): 
        routers, switches, Power over Ethernet (PoE) endpoints, protocol 
        gateways for building management systems, intelligent meters, 
        home energy gateway, hosts and servers, sensor proxy, etc.   
         
        Where applicable, monitoring of a device is extended to the 
        individual components of the device and/or to any attached 
        dependent device(s).  An example of such a case could be when a 
        device contains components that are independent from a power 
        state point of view (such as line cards, processor cards, hard 
        drives) or when a devices has dependent attached devices (such 
        as a switch with PoE endpoints or a power distribution unit with 
        attached endpoints).  
         
        Devices and their sub-components may be characterized by the 
        power related attributes of a physical entity present in the 
        ENTITY MIB, even though the ENTITY MIB compliance is not a

        requirement due to the variety and broad base of devices 
        concerned with energy management. 
         
     2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 

        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the 
        current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to 
        section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
         
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management 
        Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the 
        mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information 
        (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to 
        the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 
        58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
         
         
     3. Use Cases 

        The requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking 
        devices are specified in [POWER-MON-REQ].  The requirements in 
        [POWER-MON-REQ] cover devices that typically make up a 
        communications network such as such as switches, routers, and 
        various connected endpoints. For power monitoring to be useful, 
        a specification should also be applicable to facility meters, 
        power distribution units, gateway proxies for commercial 
        building control, home automation devices and devices that 
        interface with the utility and/or smart grid.  Due to this fact, 
        the scope of the MIB modules in this document is broader than 
        that specified in [POWER-MON-REQ].  Several scenarios that cover 
        these broader use cases are presented later in Section 6 - 
        Implementation Scenarios. 
         
     4. Terminology 

        The definitions of the basic terms like Power Monitor, Power 
        Monitor Parent, Power Monitor Child, Power Monitor Domain, Power 
        Level, and Manufacturer Power Level can be found in the Power 
        Management Architecture [POWER-MON-ARCH]. 
           
     5. Architecture Concepts Applied to the MIB Module 

        This section will go over the basic concepts specified in the 
        Power Monitor Architecture [POWER-MON-ARCH], with specific 
        information related to the MIB module specified in this document

     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>        Sept 2010 
      
        This subsection structure maps to the section "Architecture High 
        Level Concepts" sub-structure in the Power Monitoring 
        Architecture [POWER-MON-ARCH]. 
         
         
         
       5.1 Power Monitor Information    

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Information" section in [POWER-MON-
        ARCH] for background information. 
         
        The Power Monitor information is specified in the MIB module 
        primary table, i.e. the pmTable.  Every Power Monitor SHOULD 
        have a printable name pmName, and MUST HAVE a unique Power 
        Monitor index pmIndex. 
         
        pmIndex is an unique index greater than zero for each Power 
        Monitor.  It is recommended that values be assigned sequentially 
        starting from 1.  The value for each pmIndex must remain 
        constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's 
        network management system to the next re-initialization.  In 
        addition, that Power Monitor can potentially have an 
        entityPhysicalIndex from the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133] in the 
        pmPhysicalEntity, if supported by the Power Monitor.  In case of 
        Power over Ethernet (if the Power over Ethernet MIB is supported 
        on the Power Monitor), the Power Monitor pmethPortIndex and 
        pmethPortGrpIndex must contain the values of pethPsePortIndex 
        and pethPsePortGroupIndex, respectively.  In case of LLDP-MED 
        (if the LLDP-MED MIB is supported on the Power Monitor), the 
        Power Monitor pmLldpPortNumber must contain the lldpLocPortNum 
        from the LLDP MIB.    
         
        Possible pmName conventions are: textual DNS name, MAC-address 
        of the device, interface ifName, or a text string uniquely 
        identifying the Power Monitor.  However, if entPhysicalName is 
        present for the respective pmPhysicalEntity (i.e. if the ENTITY-
        MIB is supported), then the pmName SHOULD be identical to the 
        entPhysicalName.  The pmName SHOULD be unique.  As an example, 
        in the case of IP phones, pmName can be the device DNS name, 
        while in the case of router/switch line cards, the pmName should 
        contain the entPhysicalName.   
      
        To distinguish if a Power Monitor is producing, consuming or 
        metering power, the pmPowerCategory MIB object must be 
        implemented.

       5.2 Power Monitor Meter Domain 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Meter Domain" section in [POWER-MON-
        ARCH] for background information. 
         
        Each Power Monitor MUST be a member of a Power Monitor Meter 
        Domain, specified by the pmDomainName MIB Object.  The 
        pmDomainName, which is part of the pmTable, is a read-write MIB 
        object. 
         
         
       5.3 Power Monitor Parent and Child 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Parent and Child" section in [POWER-
        MON-ARCH] for background information.  In order to link the 
        Power Monitor Child and the Power Monitor Parent, the pmParentId 
        is introduced.   
      
         
       5.4 Power Monitor Context 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Context" section in [POWER-MON-ARCH] 
        for background information. 
         
        A Power Monitor can provide a pmImportance value in the range of 
        1..100 to help differentiate the use or relative value to the 
        site.  The importance range is from 1 (least important) to 100 
        (most important).  The default importance value is 1.   
      
        A Power Monitor can provide a set of pmKeywords.  These keywords 
        are a list of tags that can be used for grouping and summary 
        reporting within or between Power Monitor Meter Domains. 
         
        Additionally, a Power Monitor can provide a pmRoleDescription 
        string that indicates the purpose the Power Monitor serves in 
        the network or to site/business. 
      
         
       5.5 Power Monitor Levels 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Levels" section in [POWER-MON-ARCH] 
        for background information. 
         
        Power Levels, which represent universal states of power 
        management of a Power Monitor, are specified by the pmPowerLevel 
        MIB object.

     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>        Sept 2010 
      
        Via the pmManufacturerActualPowerLevel MIB variable, the 
        manufacturer power levels might be specified, in case the Power 
        Levels specified in this document are not (yet) supported.  The 
        manufacturer power level name can be read with the 
        pmManufacturerActualPowerLevel Name MIB variable. 
         
        The actual Power Level is specified by the pmPowerActualLevel 
        MIB objects.   
         
        The MIB objects pmPowerLevel and pmManufacturerDefinedPowerLevel 
        are contained in the pmTable MIB table. 
              
        The pmPowerLevelTable table enumerates the maximum power usage 
        in watts, for every single supported Power Level of each Power 
        Monitor. 
         
        The pmPowerLevelMappingTable table enumerates the maximum power 
        usage in watts, for every single manufacturer power level.  
        Furthermore, this table maps the manufacturer power levels with 
        the Power Levels specified in this document, more specifically 
        with the PowerMonitorLevel textual convention.  Finally, this 
        table returns the name of each manufacturer power level.  
         
         
       5.6 Power Monitor Usage Measurement 

        Refer to the "Power Monitor Usage Measurement" section in 
        [POWER-MON-ARCH] for background information. 
         
        For a Power Monitor, power usage is reported using pmPower.  The 
        magnitude of measurement is based on the pmPowerUnitMultiplier 
        MIB variable, based on the UnitMultiplier Textual Convention 
        (TC).  
                    
        For example, if current power usage of a Power Monitor is 3, it 
        could be 3 W, 3 mW, 3 KW, 3 MW depending on the value of 
        pmPowerUnitMultiplier.  Note that other measurements throughout 
        the two MIB modules in this document use the same mechanism, 
        including pmPowerLevelPowerUnitMultiplier, 
        pmDemandIntervalEnergyUnitMultiplier, and 
        pmACPwrQualityPowerUnitMultiplier. 
                                         
        In addition to knowing the usage and magnitude it is useful to 
        know how a pmPower measurement was obtained.  An NMS can use 
        this to account for the accuracy and nature of the reading 
        between different implementations.  For this pmPowerOrigin 
        describes whether the measurements were made at the device 
        itself or from a remote source.  The pmPowerMeasurementCaliber 
      
      
     <Claise, et. Al>        Expires March 25, 2011            [Page 8] 
         
     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>        Sept 2010 
      
        describes the method that was used to measure the power and can 
        distinguish actual or estimated values.  
         
        The nameplate power rating of a Power Monitor is specified in 
        pmPowerNameplate MIB object. 
         
         
       5.7 Optional Power Usage Quality 

        Refer to the "Optional Power Usage Quality" section in [POWER-
        MON-ARCH] for background information. 
         
        The optional powerQualityMIB MIB module can be implemented to 
        further describe the power usage Quality measurement.  The 
        powerQualityMIB MIB module adheres closely to the IEC 61850 7-2 
        standard to describe AC measurements.   
        The powerQualityMIB MIB module contains a primary table, the 
        pmACPwrQualityTable table, that defines power quality 
        measurements for supported pmIndex entities, as a sparse 
        extension of the pmTable (so with pmIndex as primary index).  
        This pmACPwrQualityTable table contains information such as the 
        configuration (single phase, DEL 3 phases, WYE 3 phases), the 
        voltage, frequency, power accuracy, total active/reactive 
        power/apparent power, the amphere, and the voltage.  
         
        In case of 3-phase power, the pmACPwrQualityPhaseTable 
        additional table is populated with power quality measurements 
        per phase (so double indexed by the pmIndex and pmPhaseIndex).  
        This table, which describes attributes common to both WYE and 
        DEL configurations, contains the average current, 
        active/reactive/apparent power, power factor and the impedance. 
         
        In case of 3-phase power with a DEL configuration, the 
        pmACPwrQualityDelPhaseTable table describes the phase-to-phase 
        power quality measurements, i.e., voltage and current. 
         
        In case of 3-phase power with a Wye configuration, the

        Refer to the "Optional Energy Measurement" section in [POWER-
        MON-ARCH] for background information. 
         
        It is relevant to measure the demand only when there are actual 
        power measurements from a Power Monitor, and not when the power

        measurement is assumed or predicted as specified in the 
        description clause of the object pmPowerMeasurementCaliber.    
         
        Two tables are introduced to characterize the energy demand - 
        pmDemandEnergyTable and pmDemandEnergyParametersTable.  The 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersTable table consists of parameters 
        defining: the duration of the demand intervals in seconds, 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength; the number of demand 
        intervals kept in the pmDemandEnergyTable, 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalNumber; the type of demand 
        intervals, pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalMode, and a same rate 
        used to calculate the average, 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersSampleRate.  Judicious choice of the 
        SamplingRate will ensure accurate measurement of power while not 
        imposing an excessive polling burden. 
                   
        There are three types of pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalMode 
        for energy measurement collection: period, sliding, and total.  
        These three concepts are illustrated by the following three 
        figures for which: 
        - the horizontal axis represents the current time, with the 
        symbol <--- L ---> expressing the 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength, and the 
        pmDemandEnergyIntervalStartTime is represented by S1, S2, S3, 
        S4, ..., Sx where x is the value of 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalNumber   
        - the vertical axis represents the time interval of sampling and 
        the value of pmDemandEnergyIntervalEnergyUsed can be obtained at 
        the end of the sampling period.  The symbol =========== denotes 
        the duration of the sampling period.

        A pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalMode mode of 'total' specifies 
        a continuous measurement since the last reset.  The value of 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalNumber should be (1) one and 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength is ignored. 
      
        The pmDemandEnergyParametersStatus is useful to specify the 
        energy measurement is actual and thus to indicate if the 
        pmDemandEnergyTable entries exist or not. 
         
        The pmDemand Table consists of energy measurements in 
        pmDemandIntervalEnergyUsed, the scale of energy measured, 
        pmDemandIntervalEnergyUnitMultiplier, and the maximum observed 
        demand in a window - pmDemandIntervalMax. 
         
        The pmDemandEnergyTable and pmDemandEnergyParametersTable will 
        be illustrated with the following example.  First, in order to 
        estimate demand, an interval to sample energy should be 
        specified, i.e.  pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength can be 
        "900 seconds" and the number of consecutive intervals over which 
        the maximum demand is calculated 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalNumber as "10".  The sampling 
        rate internal to the Power Monitor for measurement of power 
        usage, pmDemandEnergyParametersSampleRate, can be "1000 
        milliseconds", as set by the Power Monitor as a reasonable 
        value.  Then, the pmDemandEnergyParametersStatus is set to 
        active (value 1) to indicate that the Power Monitor should start 
        monitor the usage as per the pmDemandEnergyTable. 
         
        The indices in the pmDemandEnergyTable are pmIndex, which 
        identifies the Power Monitor, and pmDemandIntervalStartTime, 
        which denotes the start time of the demand measurement interval 
        based on sysUpTime.  The value of pmDemandIntervalEnergyUsed is 
        the measured energy consumption over the time interval specified 
        (pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength) based on the Power 
        Monitor internal sampling rate 
        (pmDemandEnergyParametersSampleRate).  While choosing the values 
        for the pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalLength and 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersSampleRate, it is recommended to take 
        into consideration either the network element resources adequate 
        to process and store the sample values and/or the mechanism used 
        to calculate the pmDemandEnergyIntervalEnergyUsed.  The units 
        are derived from pmDemandIntervalPowerUnitMultiplier.  For 
        example, pmDemandIntervalPowerUsed can be "100" with 
        pmDemandIntervalPowerUnits equal to 0, the demand is 100 watt-
        hours.  pmDemandIntervalMax is the maximum demand observed can 
        be "150 watt-hours".

        The pmDemandEnergyTable has a buffer to retain a certain number 
        of intervals, as defined by 
        pmDemandEnergyParametersIntervalNumber.  If the default value of 
        "10" is kept, then the pmDemandEnergyTable contains 10 demand 
        measurements, including the maximum.  A brief explanation on how 
        the maximum demand can be calculated is presented.  The first 
        observed demand measurement value is taken to be the initial 
        maximum.  With each subsequent measurement, based on numerical 
        comparison, maximum demand may be updated.  The maximum value is 
        retained as long as the measurements are taking place.  Based on 
        periodic polling of this table, a NMS could compute the maximum 
        over a longer period, i.e. a month, 3 months, or a year. 
         
         
       5.9 Optional Battery Information 

        EDITOR NOTE: since a merge between this draft and [QUITTEK-
        POWER-MIB] seems to be the direction that the OPSAWG IETF WG 
        wants to go, one idea is to copy the battery MIB module from 
        [QUITTEK-POWER-MIB].   
         

     6. Implementation Scenarios 

        The scope of power and energy monitoring consists of devices 
        that consume power within and connected to a communications 
        network.  These devices include: 
         
        - Network devices and sub-components: devices such as routers 
        and switches and their sub-components. 
         
        - Network attached endpoints: devices that use the 
        communications network such as endpoints, PCs, or facility 
        gateways that proxy energy monitor and control for commercial 
        buildings or home automation,  
         
        - Network attached meters or supplies: devices that can monitor 
        the electrical supply such as smart meters or Universal Power 
        Supplies (UPS) that meter and provide availability.  
        This section provides illustrative examples that model different 
        scenarios for implementation of the Power Monitor including 
        Power Monitor Parent and Power Monitor Child relationships. 
         

     Scenario 1: Switch with PoE endpoints  

        Consider a PoE IP phone connected to a switch, as displayed on 
        figure 4.  The IP phone draws power from the PoE switch.  The

        switch has the following attributes, also illustrated in Figure 
        4: pmIndex "1", pmPhysicalEntity "2", and pmPowerMonitorId "UUID 
        1000".  The power usage of the switch is "440 Watts".  The 
        switch does not have a Power Monitor Parent. 
         
        The PoE switch port has the following attributes - The switch 
        port has pmIndex "3", pmPhysicalEntity is "12" and 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1003".  The power usage of the POE 
        switch port is "12 watts".  The POE switch port has the switch 
        as the Power Monitor Parent, with its pmParentID of "1000". 
         
        The IP phone has the following attributes: the IP phone has 
        pmIndex "31" and pmPowerMonitorId "UUID 2003", but doesn't have 
        an entry for pmPhysicalEntity, as the ENTITY MIB is not 
        supported on this device.  The IP phone has a Power Monitor 
        Parent; the POE switch port whose pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 
        1003".  The power usage of the IP phone is measured at the POE 
        switch port and the pmUsage on the PoE IP phone reports 0.

                      Figure 4: Scenario 1 

      

     Scenario 2: Switch with PoE endpoints with further connected 
        device(s)  

        Consider the same scenario as example 1 with an IP phone 
        connected to PoE port of a switch.  Now, in addition, a PC is 
        also daisy-chained from the IP phone for LAN connectivity.  The 
        phone draws power from PoE port of the switch, while the PC 
        draws power from the wall outlet.  
         
        The attributes of the switch, switch port and IP phone are the 
        same as in Scenario 1.  The attributes of the PC are given 
        below.  The PC does not have pmPhysicalEntity.  The pmIndex of 
        the PC "57", the pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 3003".  The PC has a 
        Power Monitor Parent, i.e. the switch port whose 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1003".  The power usage of the PC is 
        "120 Watts" and is communicated to the switch port.  
         
        This example is used to illustrate the distinction between the 
        Power Monitor Children: the IP phone draws power from the 
        switch, while the PC has LAN connectivity from the phone, but is 
        powered from the wall outlet.  However, the Power Monitor Parent 
        sends power control messages to both the Power Monitor children 
        (IP phone and PC) and the children react upon those messages.

     Scenario 3: A switch with Wireless Access Points 

        Consider a Wireless Access Point connected to the PoE port of a 
        switch.  There are several PCs connected to the Wireless Access 
        Point over Wireless protocols.  All PCs draw power from the wall 
        outlets.  
         
        The switch port is the Power Monitor Parent for the Wireless 
        Access Point (WAP) and the PCs.  There is a distinction, between 
        the Power Monitor Children, as the WAP draws power from the PoE 
        port of the switch and the PCs draw power from the wall outlet.  
         
        The switch has pmIndex "1", pmPhysicalEntity is "2" and 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1000".  The power usage of the switch 
        is "440 Watts".  The switch does not have a Power Monitor 
        Parent.

        The PoE switch port has the following attributes - The switch 
        port has pmIndex "3", pmPhysicalEntity is "12" and 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1003".  The power usage of the POE 
        switch port is "20 watts".  The POE switch port has the switch 
        as the parent and the pmParentID is "UUID 1000".  
         
        The WAP has the following attributes.  The WAP doesn't have an 
        entry for pmPhysicalEntity.  The WAP has pmIndex "47" and 
        pmPowerMonitorId "UUID 2004" and WAP has a parent; the POE 
        switch port whose pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1003".  The power 
        usage of the WAP is measured at the PoE switch port.  
         
        The PC1 and PC2 does not have pmPhysicalEntity.  The pmIndex of 
        the PC "53", the pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 3".  The PC has a 
        parent; i.e., the switch PoE port whose pmPowerMonitorId is 
        "UUID 3004".  The power usage of the PC is "120 Watts" and is 
        communicated to the switch port.  
         
        The pmIndex of the PC2 "58", the pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 5".  
        The PC has a parent; the switch port whose pmPowerMonitorId is 
        "UUID 4004".  The power usage of the PC is "120 Watts" and is 
        communicated to the switch port.

     Scenario 4: Network connected facilities gateway 

        At the top of the network hierarchy of a building network is a 
        gateway device that can perform protocol conversion between many 
        facility management devices, such as BACNET, MODBUS, DALI, LON,  
        etc.  There are power meters associated with power consuming 
        entities (Heating Ventilation & Air Conditioning - HVAC, 
        lighting, electrical, fire control, elevators, etc).  The 
        proposed MIB can be implemented on the gateway device.  The 
        gateway can be considered as the Power Monitor Parent, while the 
        power meters associated with the energy consuming entities such 
        can be considered as Power Monitor Children.  EntPhysicalIndex 
        is not defined for these Power Monitor Parent or the Children, 
        as the ENTITY MIB is generally not implemented in such an

        environment.  Hence the gateway, meter 1, and meter 2 have 
        pmPhysicalEntities of value zero.  The pmIndex of the gateway is 
        "5", and the pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1004".  The gateway does 
        not have a Power Monitor Parent; The total power usage of the

        Meter 1 has pmIndex "100", and pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 2005". 
        Meter 1 shall report a power usage of "6000 watts".  Meter 1 has 
        the gateway as the parent and its pmParentID is "UUID 1004".  
         
        Meter 2 has pmIndex "101", and pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 3005". 
        Meter 2 shall report a power usage of "1500 watts".  Meter 2 has

     Scenario 5: Data Center Network 

        A typical data center network consists of a hierarchy of 
        switches.  At the bottom of hierarchy there are servers mounted 
        on a rack, and those are connected to the top of the rack 
        switches.  The top switches are connected to aggregation 
        switches that are in turn connected to core switches.  As an 
        example, Server 1 and Server 2 are connected to different switch 
        ports of the top switch.  
         
        The proposed MIB can be implemented on the switches.  The switch 
        can be considered as the Power Monitor Parent.  The servers can 
        be considered as the Power Monitor Children.  
         
        The switch has pmIndex "1", pmPhysicalEntity is "2", and the 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1000".  The power usage of the switch 
        is "440 Watts". The switch does not have a parent. 
         
        Firstly, the switch ports are non-PoE and have the following 
        attributes - Server 1 is connected to Switch port 1.  Switch 
        port 1 has pmIndex "3", pmPhysicalEntity is "12" and 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1003".  Switch port 2 has pmIndex "4", 
        pmPhysicalEntity is "13" and pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 1004".  
        The power usage of the non-POE switch port cannot be measured.  
        The switch ports have the switch as the Power Monitor Parent and 
        its pmParentID is "1000".  
         
         
        The Server 1 has a value of zero for pmPhysicalEntity.  The 
        pmIndex of the Server 1 is "5", and the pmPowerMonitorId is 
        "UUID 2006".  Server 1 has a Power Monitor Parent; i.e., the 
        switch port whose pmPowerMonitorId is "1003".  The power usage 
        of the Server 1 is "200 Watts" and is communicated to the switch 
        port.  
         
         
        The Server 2 has a value of zero for pmPhysicalEntity.  The 
        pmIndex of the Server 2 is "6", and the pmPowerMonitorId is 
        "UUID 3006".  Server 1 has a parent; i.e., the switch port whose 
        pmPowerMonitorId is "1054".  The power usage of the Server 2 is 
        "140 Watts" and is communicated to the switch port.  
         
        Communication of power usage of Server1 and Server2 to the 
        switch is out of scope of this document.

        uninterruptible power supplies (UPS); video surveillance; 
        physical access; and others.   
         
        A simplified illustration of the building gateway network is 
        presented in figure 9.  At the top of the network hierarchy of a 
        building network is a gateway device that performs protocol 
        conversion between many facility management devices.  The north 
        interface of the building gateway is connected to the NMS.   
        The south side of the building gateway communicates to the 
        controllers, via RS-232/RS-485 interfaces and ethernet 
        interfaces and building management protocols such as BACNET or 
        MODBUS.  Each controller is associated with a specific energy 
        consuming function such as HVAC, electrical or lighting.   
        The controllers are in turn connected to the actual building 
        energy management devices-meters, sub-meters, valves, actuators 
        etc.  Controller 1 is associated with a meter for the HVAC 
        system and controller 2 can be associated with a meter for the 
        Lighting.   
         
        With the MIB design, the building gateway can be considered as 
        the Power Monitor Parent, while the controllers associated with 
        the meters can be considered as Power Monitor Children.  This 
        assumes that MIB is implemented in the gateway device.  Thus the 
        power measurement collected is at the granularity of a 
        controller, which aggregates all the energy measurement 
        collected from all the meters and sub-meters.  However, if 
        energy measurement needs to be collected at a meter level, then 
        the MIB should be implemented at the controller level.  
      
        Typically in building management, the EntPhysicalIndex is not 
        defined for these Power Monitor Parent or the Children, as the 
        ENTITY MIB is generally not implemented for these devices.  
        Hence the gateway, controller 1, and controller 2 have 
        pmPhysicalEntities of value zero.   
         
        The pmIndex of the gateway is "7", and the pmPowerMonitorId is 
        "UUID 1007". The gateway does not have a Power Monitor Parent; 
        The total power usage of the gateway and its children is "2000 
        Watts".  
         
        Controller 1 has pmIndex "707", and pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 
        5007". Controller 1 shall report a power usage of "2000 watts".  
        Controller 1 has the gateway as the parent and its pmParentID is 
        "UUID 1007".  
         
        Controller 2 has pmIndex "708", and pmPowerMonitorId is "UUID 
        5008". Controller 2 shall report a power usage of "500 watts".

     Scenario 7: Switch with Power Distribution Units (PDU) 

        Consider the same scenario as example 1 with two PDUs.  The 
        switch draws power from one of the PDU's, while the PDU's are 
        plugged into the switch for LAN connectivity.  
         
        The attributes of the switch and switch ports are the same as 
        in Scenario 1.  The attributes of the PDUs are given below.

        The PDU's are network peers of the switch, with their own 
        management agent and no pmPowerMonitor parent pmPowerMonitorId, 
        as the PDU's are Power Monitor Parent themselves.  The power 
        usage of the PDU's are reporting 3000 watts and 12000 watts 
        categorized as 'Meter'. 
         
        This example is used to illustrate the distinction between 
        power supply, metering, and LAN connectivity: the PDUs supply 
        and meter power to the switch, while the PC has LAN 
        connectivity from the phone, but is powered from the wall 
        outlet.  However, the Power Monitor Parent sends power control 
        messages to both the Power Monitor children (IP phone and PC) 
        and the children react upon those messages.

     Scenario 8: Power Consumption of UPS 

        Data centers and commercial buildings can have Uninterruptible 
        Power Supplies (UPS) connected to the network. The Power Monitor 
        can be used to model a UPS as a Power Monitor Parent with the 
        connected devices as Power Monitor Children. 
         
        EDITOR'S NOTE: the example will be completed in the future. 
         
     Scenario 9: Power Consumption of Battery-based Devices 

        As specified in [POWER-MON-REQ], battery state monitoring is a 
        requirement for the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB.  
        EDITOR NOTE: since a merge between this draft and [QUITTEK-
        POWER-MIB] seems to be the direction that the OPSAWG IETF WG 
        wants to go, one idea is to copy the battery MIB module from 
        [QUITTEK-POWER-MIB].

     7.1. Link with the ENTITY MIB and the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB  

        RFC 4133 [RFC4133] defines the ENTITY MIB module that lists the 
        physical entities of a networking device (router, switch, 
        etc...) and those physical entities listed indexed by 
        entPhysicalIndex.  From an energy management point of view, the 
        physical entities that consume or produce energy are of 
        interest.

        RFC 3433 [RFC3433] defines the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB module that 
        provides a standardized way of obtaining information (current 
        value of the sensor, operational status of the sensor, and the 
        data units precision) from sensors embedded in networking 
        devices.  Sensors are associated with each index of 
        entPhysicalIndex of the ENTITY MIB [RFC4133].  While the focus 
        of the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB, is on measurement of 
        power usage of networking equipment indexed by the ENTITY MIB, 
        this MIB proposes a customized power scale for power measurement 
        and different power level states of networking equipment and a 
        functionality to configure the power level states. 
         
        When this MIB module is used to monitor the power usage of 
        devices such as routers and switches, the ENTITY MIB and ENTITY-
        SENSOR MIB SHOULD be implemented.  In such cases, the Power 
        Monitors are modeled by the entPhysicalIndex through the 
        pmPhysicalEntity MIB object specified in the pmTable.   

        However, the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433] doesn't have the ANSI 
        C12.x accuracy classes required for electricity, i.e., 1%, 2%, 
        0.5% accuracy classes: indeed, the entPhySensorPrecision 
        [RFC3433] represents "The number of decimal places of precision 
        in fixed-point sensor values returned by the associated 
        entPhySensorValue object".  The ANSI and IEC Standards are used 
        for power measurement and these standards require that we use an 
        accuracy class, and not the scientific number precision model as 
        specified in RFC3433.  The pmPowerAccuracy MIB object models 
        this accuracy.  Note that the pmPowerUnitMultipler represents 
        the scale factor per IEC 61850, which is a more logical 
        representation for power measurements (compared to 
        entPhySensorScale), with the mantissa and the exponent values X 
        * 10 ^ Y. 

        Power measurements specifying the qualifier 'UNITS' for each 
        measured value in watts are used by the LLDP-EXT-MED-MIB, POE 
        [RFC3621], and UPS [RFC1628] MIBs.  The same 'UNITS' qualifier 
        is used for the power measurement values.    
         
        One cannot assume that the ENTITY MIB and ENTITY-SENSOR MIB are 
        implemented for all Power Monitor that needs to be monitored.  A 
        typical example is a converged building gateway, monitoring 
        several other devices in the building, doing the proxy between 
        SNMP and a protocol such as BACNET.  Another example is the home 
        energy controller.  In such cases, the pmPhysicalEntity value 
        contains the zero value, thanks to PhysicalIndexOrZero textual 
        convention.

        The pmIndex MIB object has been kept as the unique Power Monitor 
        index.   The pmPower is similar to entPhySensorValue [RFC3433] 
        and the pmPowerUnitMultipler is similar to entPhySensorScale. 
      
         
     7.2. Link with the ENTITY-STATE MIB  

        For each entity in the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133], the ENTITY-STATE 
        MIB [RFC4268] specifies the operational states (entStateOper: 
        unknown, enabled, disabled, testing), the alarm (entStateAlarm: 
        unknown, underRepair, critical, major, minor, warning, 
        indeterminate) and the possible values of standby states  
        (entStateStandby: unknown, hotStandby, coldStandby, 
        providingService). 
         
        From a power monitoring point of view, in contrast to the entity 
        operational states of entities, Power Levels are required, as 
        proposed in the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB module.  Those 
        Power Levels can be mapped to the different operational states 
        in the ENTITY-STATE MIB, if a formal mapping is required.  For 
        example, the entStateStandby "unknown", "hotStandby", 
        "coldStandby", states could map to the Power Level "unknown", 
        "ready", "standby", respectively, while the entStateStandby 
        "providingService" could map to any "low" to "high" Power Level. 
         
         
     7.3. Link with the POWER-OVER-ETHERNET MIB 

        Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] provides energy monitoring and 
        configuration framework for power over Ethernet devices.  The 
        RFC introduces a concept of a port group on a switch to define 
        power monitoring and management policy and does not use the 
        entPhysicalIndex as index.  Indeed, the  
        pethMainPseConsumptionPower is indexed by the 
        pethMainPseGroupIndex, which has no mapping with the 
        entPhysicalIndex.  
         
        One cannot assume that the Power-over-Ethernet MIB is 
        implemented for all Power Monitors that need to be monitored.  A 
        typical example is a converged building gateway, monitoring 
        several other devices in the building, doing the proxy between 
        SNMP and a protocol such as BACNET.  Another example is the home 
        energy controller.  In such cases, the pmethPortIndex and 
        pmethPortGrpIndex values contain the zero value, thanks to new 
        PethPsePortIndexOrZero and textual PethPsePortGroupIndexOrZero 
        conventions.

     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>        Sept 2010 
      
        However, if the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, 
        the Power Monitor pmethPortIndex and pmethPortGrpIndex contain 
        the pethPsePortIndex and pethPsePortGroupIndex, respectively. 
         
        As a consequence, the pmIndex MIB object has been kept as the 
        unique Power Monitor index. 
         
        Note that, even the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] was 
        created after the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB [RFC3433], it does not reuse 
        the precision notion from the ENTITY-SENSOR MIB, i.e. the 
        entPhySensorPrecision MIB object. 
         
          
     7.4. Link with the UPS MIB 

        To protect against unexpected power disruption, data centers and 
        buildings make use of Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS).  To 
        protect critical assets, a UPS can be restricted to a particular 
        subset or domain of the network.  UPS usage typically can last 
        only for a finite period of time, until normal power supply is 
        restored.  Planning is required to decide on the capacity of UPS 
        based on output power and duration of probable power outage.  
        From a power provisioning point of view of a data center or 
        building, it is important to understand the total demand 
        required to support all the entities in order to plan on the 
        capacity of the UPS to be installed.  This demand can be 
        monitored via the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB.  

        UPS MIB [RFC1628] provides information on the state of the UPS 
        network.  Implementation of UPS MIB is useful at the aggregate 
        level of a data center or a building.  The MIB module contains 
        several groups of variables - upsIdent - to identify the UPS 
        entity (name, model,..), the upsBattery group - to indicate the 
        battery state, (upsbatteryStatus, upsEstimatedMinutesRemaining, 
        ...), upsInput group - to characterize the input load to the UPS 
        (number of input lines, voltage, current,...) , upsOutput - to 
        characterize the output from the UPS (number of output lines, 
        voltage, current,...), upsAlarms - to indicate the various alarm 
        events.  The measurement of power in UPS MIB are in Volts,  Amps 
        and Watts.  The units of power measurement are RMS volts, RMS 
        Amps and are not based on EntitySensorDataScale and 
        EntitySensorDataPrecision of Entity-Sensor MIB. 

        Both the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB and the UPS MIB may be 
        implemented on the same UPS SNMP agent, without conflict.  In 
        such a case, the UPS device itself would be the Power Monitor 
        Parent and any the UPS meters or submeters would be the Power 
        Monitor Children.

     7.5. Link with the LLDP and LLDP-MED MIBs 

        The LLDP Protocol is a Data Link Layer protocol used by network 
        devices for advertising of their identities, capabilities, and 
        interconnections on a LAN network.  
         
        The Media Endpoint Discovery is an enhancement of LLDP, known as 
        LLDP-MED.  The LLDP-MED enhancements specifically address voice 
        applications.  LLDP-MED covers 6 basic areas - capabilities 
        discovery, LAN speed and duplex discovery, network policy 
        discovery, location identification discovery, inventory 
        discovery, and power discovery.   
         
        Of particular interest to the current MIB module is the power 
        discovery, which allows the end device such as a PoE phone to 
        convey power requirement to the switch.  In the power discovery, 
        the LLDP-MED has four Type Length Value (TLV): power type, power 
        source, power priority and power value.  Respectively, those 
        TLVs provide information related to the type of power (power 
        sourcing entity versus powered device), how the device is 
        powered (from the line, from a backup source, from external 
        power source, etc.), the power priority (how important is it 
        that this device has power?), and how much power the device 
        needs. 
          
        The power priority specified in the LLDP-MED MIB [LLDP-MED-MIB] 
        actually comes from the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621]. If 
        the Power-over-Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported, the exact 
        value from the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621] is copied over 
        in the lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority [LLDP-MED-MIB], otherwise 
        the value in lldpXMedRemXPoEPDPowerPriority is "unknown". From 
        the Power and Energy Monitoring MIB, it is possible to identify 
        the pethPsePortPowerPriority [RFC3621], thanks to the 
        pmethPortIndex and pmethPortGrpIndex. 
         
        The lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource [LLDP-MED-MIB] is similar to 
        pmPowerOrigin to indicate if the power for an attached device is 
        local or from a remote device. If LLDP-MED MIB is supported, the 
        following mapping can be applied to the pmPowerOrigin; 
        lldpXMedLocXPoEPDPowerSource fromPSE(2) and local(3) can be 
        mapped to remote(2) and self(1), respectively.

     8. Structure of the MIB 

       The primary MIB object in this MIB module is the 
       PowerMonitorMIBObject.  The pmTable table of 
       PowerMonitorMibObject describes an entity in the network that is 
       a Power Monitor. 
         
       A Power Monitor contains information to describe the entity in 
       the context of the network (such as its Power Monitor Meter 
       Domain pmDomainName) and attributes for describing its business 
       context (such as pmImportance, pmRoleDescription and 
       pmKeywords).  
        
       A Power Monitor contains information describing its power usage 
       (pmPower) along with its power state (pmPowerLevel).  Along with 
       the power usage is information describing how the power usage 
       was determined (such as pmPowerMeasurementCaliber and 
       pmPowerOrigin). 
        
       The pmPowerLevelMappingTable table enumerates the maximum power 
       usage in watts, for every single manufacturer power level.  
       Furthermore, this table maps the manufacturer power levels with 
       the Power Levels specified in this document, more specifically 
       with the PowerMonitorLevel textual convention.  Finally, this 
       table returns the name of each manufacturer power level.  
        
       A Power Monitor may also contain an optional pmPowerQuality 
       table that describes the electrical characteristics associated 
       with the current power state and usage. 
        
       A Power Monitor may contain an optional pmDemandEnergyTable to 
       describe energy information over time. 
        
       A Power Monitor may also contain optional battery information 
       associated with this entity.  
       EDITOR NOTE: since a merge between this draft and [QUITTEK-
       POWER-MIB] seems to be the direction that the OPSAWG IETF WG 
       wants to go, one idea is to copy the battery MIB module from 
       [QUITTEK-POWER-MIB].

        "An enumerated integer value that represents the value of the 
        power policy level, a current power setting at which a Power 
        Monitor uses power. 
                 
        There are twelve power policy levels; divided into six  
        operational states, and six non-operational states.  The lowest 
        non-operational state is 1 and the highest is six.  Each non-
        operational state corresponds to an ACPI level [ACPI]. 
         
        Global and System level state between G3 (hard-off) and G1 
        (sleeping).  For operational levels, 6 is the lowest, and 12 the 
        highest (full power).  Each operational level represent a 
        performance state, and may be mapped to ACPI states P0 (maximum 
        performance & power) through P5 (minimum performance and minimum 
        power).   
                 
        An entity may have fewer power levels than twelve and would then 
        map several policy levels to the same power state.  Entities 
        with more than twelve levels, would choose which twelve to 
        represent as power policy levels. 
                 
        Note that Power Monitor Parent MUST report some of the non 
        operational Power Levels of its Power Monitor Children who are 
        unable to report their Power Level.  A typical example a phone 
        which may notify its Power Monitor Parent that it will go into a 
        mechoff(1) or hibernate(3) state so that the Power Monitor

        zero or 1 watt.  Conversely, a PC with Desktop and mobile 
        Architecture for System Hardware [DASH] out-of-band management 
        is an example where a Power Monitor Child can report its usage 
        and level even when in a non-operational state. 
                 
        In each of the non operational levels (from mechoff(1) to 
        ready(6)), the Power Level preceding it is expected to have a 
        lower power consumption and a longer delay in returning to an 
        operational state.  
         
         
                 mechoff(1)  : An off state where no entity features are 
                               available.  The entity is unavailable. 
                               No energy is being consumed and the power 
                               connector can be removed.  This  
                               corresponds to the level G3 in ACPI.   
                           
                 softoff(2)  : Similar to mechoff(1), but some  
                               components remain powered or receive 
                               trace power so that the entity  
                               can be woken from its off state.  In  
                               softoff(2), no context is saved and the  
                               device typically requires a complete boot  
                               when awakened.  This corresponds to level  
                               G2 in ACPI. 
         
                 hibernate(3): No entity features are available.  The 
                               entity may be woken up without requiring  
                               a complete boot, but the time for  
                               availability is longer than sleep(4). An  
                               example for state hibernate(3) is a save- 
                               to-disk state where DRAM context is not  
                               maintained. Typically, energy consumption  
                               is zero or close to zero.  This  
                               corresponds to level G1, S4 in ACPI. 
         
                 sleep(4)    : No entity features are available, except  
                               for out-of-band management, for example   
                               wake-up mechanisms. The time for  
                               availability is longer than standby(5).  
                               An example for state sleep(4) is a save- 
                               to-RAM state, where DRAM context is  
                               maintained.  Typically, energy  
                               consumption is close to zero. This  
                               corresponds to level G1, S3 in ACPI. 
         
                 standby(5) : No entity features are available, except  
                              for out-of-band management, for example

                              to cold-standy.  The time for availability  
                              is longerthan ready(6).  For example, the  
                              processor context is not maintained.  
                              Typically, energy consumption is close to  
                              zero. This corresponds to level G1, S2 in  
                              ACPI. 
         
                 ready(6)    : No entity features are available, except  
                               for out-of-band management, for example  
                               wake-up mechanisms. This mode is  
                               analogous to hot-standy.  The entity can  
                               be quickly transitioned into an  
                               operational state.  For example,  
                               processors are not executing, but  
                               processor context is maintained. This  
                               corresponds to level G1, S1 in ACPI.

     10. Security Considerations 

        Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects 
        with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is 
        thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these 
        objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects 
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.   
         
        There are a number of management objects defined in these MIB 
        modules with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
        create.  Such objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable 
        in some network environments.  The support for SET operations in 
        a non-secure environment without proper protection can have a 
        negative effect on network operations.  The following are the 
        tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
         
          . Unauthorized changes to the pmDomainName, pmName, and/or 
             pmRoleDescription, MAY disrupt the power and energy 
             collection, and therefore any predefined policies defined 
             in the network. 
          . Unauthorized changes to the pmPowerLevel MAY disrupt the 
             power settings of the different Power Monitor, and 
             therefore the level of functionality of the respective 
             Power Monitors.

     Internet-Draft        <Energy Monitoring MIB>        Sept 2010 
      
          . Unauthorized changes to the pmDemandControlTable MAY 
             disrupt the energy measurement in the pmDemandEnergyTable 
             table.  
      
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using 
        IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure 
        network is allowed to access and GET/SET 
        (read/change/create/delete) the objects in these MIB modules. 
         
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security 
        features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], 
        section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic 
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy). 
         
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
        an instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give 
        access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
        legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) 
        them. 
         

     11. IANA Considerations 

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned 
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry: 
         
               Descriptor            OBJECT IDENTIFIER value 
               ----------            ----------------------- 
               PowerMonitorMIB         { mib-2 xxx } 
         
        Additions to this MIB module are subject to Expert Review 
        [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of experts designated 
        by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts MUST check the 
        requested MIB objects for completeness and accuracy of the 
        description.  Requests for MIB objects that duplicate the 
        functionality of existing objects SHOULD be declined.  The 
        smallest available OID SHOULD be assigned to a new MIB objects.  
        The specification of new MIB objects SHOULD follow the structure 
        specified in Section 6 and MUST be published using a well-
        established and persistent publication medium.
