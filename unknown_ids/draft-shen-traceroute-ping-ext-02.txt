Abstract

   This document specifies extensions to traceroute and ping techniques
   to enable their (probes) authentication, and to include requests for
   node specific information that the probe sender is interested in
   receiving from one or more nodes via the traceroute and ping replies.
   These extensions support UDP, TCP and ICMP types of traceroute and
   ping probes.

Internet-Draft            Traceroute Extension            September 2011


1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Traceroute and Ping are two of commonly used tools in the diagnosis
   of network problems.  This document proposes the mechanism by which
   the (traceroute or ping) probe message can be authenticated by the
   receiving node(s).  This document also specifies the mechanism for
   the probe sending node to request specific information from the
   receiving node(s).  These mechanisms are intended for network
   operators to perform more secured network management and
   troubleshooting tasks while using traceroute and ping tools.  The
   changes proposed in this document are backward compatible (with the
   existing traceroute and ping tools) and applicable to both IPv4 and
   IPv6 networks.

   The mechanisms specified in this document apply to to the following
   traceroute and ping probe protocols: UDP [RFC0768], TCP [RFC0793],
   and ICMP/ICMPv6 [RFC0792] [RFC4443].

   This document defines an extension for traceroute and ping probe
   messages to optionally include authentication signature.  The
   intermediate and destination nodes can authenticate the sender of the
   traceroute or ping packet before providing the requested information
   in the ICMP response.  This document also includes an Information-
   Request TLV for the traceroute/ping extension.  This TLV specifies
   the types of information the sender expects to be included in the
   traceroute/ping response (i.e., in the ICMP message elicited by the
   traceroute/ping packet and generated by the intermediate or
   destination node or nodes).

   This specification is evolved from the UDP Traceroute Extension
   document [I-D.shen-udp-traceroute-ext].


3.  Motivation

   Although one may employ a rudimentary control mechanism to limit the
   trusted senders by defining on every router the access control lists
   specifying source addresses of the traceroute and ping message, such
   mechanism is deemed configuration intensive, static, and error-prone.
   Moreover, such mechanism would be susceptible to address spoofing.
   Additionally, such mechanism does not provide the sender with dynamic

   control of the different kind of extensions to be requested.

   The ICMP reply messages has been extended to support multi-part
   message inside ICMP [RFC4884].  Some of the applications [RFC5837]
   [RFC4950] [I-D.shen-icmp-routing-inst] are designed mainly for
   internal network troubleshooting by network operators.  Network
   providers may want to limit those applications only to trusted
   senders of traceroute/ping probes due to security or policy reasons
   by using this mechanism described in this document.


4.  Probe Message Extension

   This proposed extension is to define a probe data structure which
   resides within UDP/TCP/ICMP data field; and to reserve the lowest 4
   bits inside a 16-bit field within UDP/TCP/ICMP headers to indicate
   the extension structure offset location.

   In most of the traceroute implementation, there is some private data
   in probe messages used by traceroute applications.  With this
   "extension offset" defined, the applications can continue to use
   those private data while supporting this probe extension in a
   deterministic way.  This extension applies to both traceroute and
   ping applications.

4.1.  Probe Structure

   The probe structure starts in UDP/TCP/ICMP data field location from 0
   to 56 octets specified in the "extension offset", see Section 4.2, in
   32-bit boundary.  It MUST have exactly one probe common header
   followed by zero or more probe TLVs.

4.1.1.  Probe Common Header

   The Common Header is a 8 octets structure has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   The fields of the Common Header are defined as follows:

   Version: 4 bits.  It is defined as 1 in this document.

   Length:  12 bits.  The total length of the probe data structure
            specifying number of 32-bit words (includes the common
            header and all the TLVs).

   Checksum:  16 bits.  The one's complement of the one's complement sum
            of the probe data structure, with the checksum field
            replaced by zero for the purpose of computing the checksum.

   Magic Number:  32 bits.  It is defined as Hex value of 0x54726163 in
            this document.  This is used mainly for structure
            identification of this extension version.

4.1.2.  Probe TLV

   Probe TLVs (Type-Length-Value tuples) have the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3

     .                                                               .
     .                                                               .
     .                                                               .
     |                                                               |

   Type:    16 bits.

   Length:  16 bits.  Length of the Value field in octets.

   Value:   Depends on the Type.  It is zero padded to align to a
            4-octet boundary.

   This document defines two TLVs below.

4.1.2.1.  Probe Authentication TLV

   This TLV carries the HMAC authentication related information.  It
   verifies both the data integrity and the authenticity of the entire
   message.  This TLV has the following format:

     |                                                               |
     |                     Auth Data (Variable)                      |
     |                                                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Auth Type:  16 bits.  The following values are proposed:

            *  Type=0 signifies no authentication.

            *  Type=1 signifies simple password based authentication.

            *  Type=2 signifies Cryptographic authentication.

            Please note that the above type values are in line with IANA
            allocated values for other protocols (e.g., OSPF).

   Key ID:  8 bits.  This allows multiple secret keys to be active
            simultaneously.  Using Key IDs makes the key rollover
            convenient.  Each secret key must be associated with the
            hash algorithm.  This may be done through provisioning on
            each node.

   Auth Data Len:  8 bits.  This specifies the length of the
            authentication data (and allows for the support of current
            and future authentication schemes).

   Auth Data:  Variable length.  This field carries the result (e.g.,
            HMAC code) of the HMAC algorithm applied over the entire
            traceroute/ping IP/IPv6 packet.  When the Auth data is
            calculated, the shared key is stored in this field, and the
            checksum fields in the IP header, UDP/TCP/ICMP header and
            probe common header are set to zero.  The result of the
            algorithm is placed in the Auth Key field.  The following
            lists algorithms that could be commonly supported:

            *  HMAC-MD5

            *  HMAC-SHA1

            *  HMAC-SHA2 variants (e.g., 224, 256, 384, 512, etc.)

            At least HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA1 algorithms should be
            supported on all the nodes compliant with this
            specification.

4.1.2.2.  Probe Information-Request TLV

   The Information-Request TLV has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |     Type = 2 (Info-Req)       |          Length = 4           |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                       Info Request                            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Info-Req:  32 bits.  This bitflag field lists the request items the
            probe sender is interested.  The bit number ranges from the
            right most bit to the left most bit.  Currently defined as
            the following:

              Bit Number Information Item
                   0     MPLS label related attributes
                   1     Interface related attributes
                   2     IP/IPv6 address related attributes
                   3     Routing Instance related attributes
                   4     Nexthop(s) related attributes
                   5     Device role related attributes

4.2.  Probe Extension Offset Field

   This probe "extension offset" field is defined as the lowest nibble
   within a 16-bit field, and it specifies the position at which the
   probe extension data structure begins.  The value represents 32-bit
   words ranges from 0x0 to 0xF, with value 0xF as reserved.  Thus the
   position of the probe data structure can start from 0 to 56 octets
   inside TCP, UDP or ICMP data field.  The probe "extension offset"
   field value 0xF indicates there is no probe data structure inside the
   message data field.

   The probe "extension offset" field is defined as the following:

   |                       |Ext-Off|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Ext-Off: 4 bits.  The value (Ext-Off) represents the probe data
            structure start position in 32-bit words.  The Ext-Off value
            0xF is reserved.

   The rest of the 12 bits out of this 16-bit field is not changed by
   this proposal.  For application usage detail in terms of different
   traceroute/ping probe types, see Section 4.2.4.

4.2.1.  UDP Messages

   In the UDP traceroute/ping probe case, this 16-bit field is the UDP
   source port field in UDP header [RFC0768].  The "Ext-Off" specifies
   the probe extension structure start location inside UDP data field.

4.2.2.  TCP Messages

   In the TCP traceroute/ping probe case, this 16-bit field is the TCP
   source port field in TCP header [RFC0793].  The "Ext-Off" specifies
   the probe extension structure start location inside TCP data field.

4.2.3.  ICMP Messages

   In the ICMP traceroute/ping probe case, this 16-bit field is the
   "Identifier" field of ICMP type 8 structure [RFC0792], The "Ext-Off"
   specifies the probe extension structure start location inside ICMP
   data field of the type 8(ICMP echo request) message.

4.2.4.  Implementation Discussion

   In the majority of today's traceroute implementations, the
   application process identifier (process-ID) is used as the UDP source
   port for UDP type of traceroute probe; in TCP implementation, the
   process-ID is used as the TCP source port for traceroute probe; and
   the process-ID is also used as the ICMP Identifier of ICMP type 8
   message.  With this extension, an implementation can use the highest
   12-bits of the source port field for UDP/TCP header and ID field for
   ICMP type 8 message to encode this process information since the
   lowest 4-bits are now reserved for the probe "extension offset".

   Ping implementation is similar to traceroute, it either uses the
   process-ID or an internally generated number inside the ICMP echo
   request ID field and in UDP/TCP source port field.  An implementation

   now can use the highest 12-bits of the field and leave the lowest
   4-bits for the probe extension.


5.  Implementation and Operation Considerations

   There is no change in this extension for the normal traceroute/ping
   implementation and operation except for reserving the lowest 4 bits
   in the UDP/TCP source port field and ICMP Id field of type 8 message.
   The implementations for the sender can use the same semantics with
   this 16-bit field; and it makes no difference to the receivers if
   they don't support this extension.

5.1.  Traceroute and Ping Probe Sender

   The sender supports this extension MAY include the Probe structure in
   it's traceroute/ping probe to specify the request types and
   authentication key.  The sender SHOULD set the "extension offset"
   value to 0xF if there is no Probe structure present inside the probe.
   The sender MAY request one or multiple types of information defined
   in the probe "Info-Req" TLV.

5.2.  Traceroute and Ping Probe Receiver

   When the traceroute/ping probe receiver, the intermediate and
   destination node, processes the incoming probe, it MAY check the
   Probe structure to verify if the sender is from an authenticated host
   and to see what types of information it requested.  This check is
   only needed when the receiver tries to authenticate the probe sender,
   or when the receiver is formating the ICMP and ICMPv6s that support
   multi-part messages and it has certain internal information that can
   be included in the ICMP packets.

   If the probe "extension offset" value is not 0xF, the probe structure
   may be present.  The receiver MUST verify the integrity of the data
   structure by examining the "version" field, the Magic-Number value,
   and the length of the probe structure.  It MUST perform the checksum
   to verify the probe data structure.  If the authentication TLV is
   present and the local policy requires it to perform the verification,
   the receiver MUST use it's locally stored shared key to validate the
   checksum in the TLV.  Multiple Authentication Keys can be used which
   can be useful in the case the probes are from trusted peer networks.

   If the probe "Info-Req" TLV is included, the receiver SHOULD fetch
   the related information when formating the ICMP packets, but MUST NOT
   include information that has the corresponding bitflag cleared.

   Even if the authentication fails, the receiver MAY still send the

   regular ICMP echo reply back to the sender, without the requested or
   internal information, as if this probe extension is not supported.


6.  Security Considerations

   This extension enhances the security of traceroute and ping operation
   in a backwards-compatible fashion.  The mechanism allows the receiver
   to verify the sender of the traceroute/ping packet such that certain
   sensitive interface and network related information can be supplied
   in the internal network or across trusted networks.

   The use of Cryptographic authentication (i.e., an Auth Type value of
   2) allows for a strong authentication mechanism since the keys cannot
   be discerned by intercepting the packets.  The proposed Keyed
   authentication does not prevent replay attacks.  However, in the case
   of replay attacks, since the packet source IP/IPv6 address of the
   traceroute/ping probe can not be changed, there is no easy way for
   the attacker to retrieve the ICMP messages.

   A router needs to protect against purposefully-bogus Traceroute
   packets with extensions that fail the authentication, as a high rate
   of messages can require significant processing time.  [RFC1812]
   specifies how rate-limiting is applied to the generation of ICMP
   messages, and this rate-limiting deters the threat when applied
   before checking the Authentication.  Additionally, when using
   Cryptographic authentication, the HMAC includes the source IP
   address, which means the HMAC will not validate if the traceroute/
   ping packet is sent over a NAT.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The Probe Extension contains probe TLVs.  IANA should establish a
   registry of Probe Extension Types.  This document defines Type 1 and
   Type 2 for authentication and information-request.  Types 3-0xF6 are
   allocated through Expert Review [RFC5226].  Types 0xF7 to 0xFF are
   reserved for private use.

   IANA should also establish a registry for Probe Info-Request Bits.
   This document defines bits 0 - 5 in Section 4.1.2.2.  Bits 6-29 are
   allocated through Expert Review.  Bits 30 - 31 are reserved for
   private use.
