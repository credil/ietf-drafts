     Unicast Transmission of IPv6 Multicast Messages on Link-layer
                draft-gundavelli-v6ops-l2-unicast-04.txt

Abstract

   When transmitting an IPv6 packet to a multicast group, the
   destination address in the link-layer header is typically set to the
   corresponding mapped address of the destination address from the IP
   header.  However, it is not mandatory that the destination address in
   the link-layer header is always a mapped multicast equivalent of its
   IP destination address.  There are various deployment scenarios where
   there is an opportunity for the sender to transmit the message as an
   unicast message on the link-layer.  Unfortunately, the IPv6
   specifications do not clearly state this.  This document explicitly
   clarifies this point and makes such packet construct and transmission
   legal and valid.

Internet-Draft     Unicast Transmission on Link-layer        August 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document is about a clarification to the construction and
   processing rules of IPv6 multicast messages [RFC2464].  When there
   are multiple link-layer receivers for an IP multicast message on a
   broadcast LAN, the link layer multicast address corresponding to the
   IP address is the one to be used.  However, if there is only one
   receiver and its link-layer address is known it is legal to send the
   IP multicast to the unicast link-layer address of that system.
   Senders therefore have that option, and receivers should not refuse
   the message on that basis.  (Example: as in some cases of sparse mode
   multicast, or in other intended use-cases such as for supporting
   shared links in Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213], or as proposed in
   [I-D.costa-6man-dad-proxy-00], in which a Duplicate Address Detection
   Proxy sends layer-2 unicast messages when appropriate to limit VLAN
   flooding).

   The function of the link-layer is purely for transmitting the frame
   to a node or to a set of nodes on a given link.  A received multicast
   message may have been transmitted as a unicast message on the link-
   layer.  The destination address in the link-layer header of that
   packet will be a unicast address, while the destination address in
   the IP header can be a multicast address.  It is inconsequential for
   the network layer protocols or the IP stack to go across the layers
   and check the semantics of message delivery.  Any such check is a
   violation of the principles of protocol layering and does not serve
   any purpose.  Unfortunately, [RFC4861] or [RFC2464] does not
   explicitly state this.  However, the authors of this document have
   verified many open source and commercial IPv6 implementations on the
   behavior of the existing IPv6 stacks, firewalls and they could not
   find any implementation that drops IPv6 packets sent to a multicast
   destination address in the IP header, but with a unicast destination
   address in the link-layer header.

   As a result of this analysis, it appears to be quite safe to
   explicitly state that such message construct is valid, so future
   implementations do not drop packets based on these checks.  Section 3
   of this document defines the additional normative considerations for
   IPv6 nodes to allow this mode of packet transmission.

3.  Sending and Receiving IPv6 Multicast Packets

   The following additional considerations MUST be applied by all IPv6
   nodes when sending and receiving IPv6 multicast messages.

   o  An IPv6 sender node in some special cases and specifically when
      the link-layer address of the target node is known, MAY choose to
      transmit an IPv6 multicast message as a link-layer unicast message
      to that node.  In this case, the destination address in the IPv6
      header will be a multicast group address, but the destination
      address in the link-layer header will be an unicast address.

   o  An IPv6 receiver node SHOULD NOT drop a received IPv6 multicast
      message only for the one specific reason that the received IPv6
      message has a multicast destination address in the IPv6 header
      while the link-layer header has a unicast address.  Such a
      validity check comparing the address types in the IP header and
      the link-layer header is considered a layer violation.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document is about a clarification to the construction and
   processing rules of IPv6 multicast messages.  This clarification
   explicitly permits an IPv6 node to send an IPv6 multicast message to
   the unicast link-layer address of the target node.  This change does
   not introduce any new security vulnerabilities.

   Network firewalls and Deep Packet inspection tools that perform any
   such checks, matching the destination address types in the IPv6
   header and the link-layers have to modified to allow such packet
   transmission.  However, the authors of this document could not find a
   single existing implementation that performs this check.
