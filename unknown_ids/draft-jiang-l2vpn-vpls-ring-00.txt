Abstract

   This document describes ring based VPLS architecture. This
   architecture is an alternative to existing VPLS architecture. It can
   simplify the full mesh connection overhead and provide a standard
   based protection mechanism, especially when the underlying cable or
   fiber infrastructure is ring based. It is also an optimal
   architecture for customer multicast traffic compared with existing
   VPLS.

1. Introduction

   VPLS is to use MPLS to deliver Ethernet service over WAN.

   Currently, VPLS architecture is based on VPLS framework [RFC 4664].
   And full mesh +split horizon is one of the most widely deployed modes.

   In this mode, VSIs in the same service VPN connect with each other
   via full mesh PWs, and use split horizon forwarding scheme. This
   design is to prevent loop in the forwarding path.

   Full mesh imposes heavy load on forwarding, control & management
   plane, and not scalable. Hierarchical VPLS discussed in LDP VPLS [RFC
   4762] (Hub-Spoke) and BGP VPLS [RFC 4761] (Route Reflector) are
   proposed to fix the problem.

   However, in certain scenario like ring network, it can be optimized.

   Ring is a common network topology for many service provider's cable
   or fiber infrastructure.

   Mapping basic full mesh or hierarchical connections to ring is not
   very elegant. It will also cause unnecessary customer multicast
   traffic copies, which will be explained in following section.

   There are some ring based Ethernet forwarding and protection designs
   that we can use to construct a more elegant and simple VPLS solution.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].



3. Analysis of related documents

   There are several works on ring based VPLS.

   1) VPLS protection switching with ring access [draft-song-l2vpn-vpls-
   ring-access]

   In this document, ring based technology is deployed in the access
   part of VPLS, which includes CE and the connected PE. They can use
   ring for multi-homing access and protection. It covers single, dual
   and multiple CE multi-homing scenarios.

   2) Pseudowire (PW) Redundancy Framework [draft-ietf-pwe3-redundancy]

   In this document, PW redundancy is used to provide multi-homing
   solution for VPLS. It has discussed the scenario of PW redundancy for
   dual-homing between PEs in ring topology, and has a very brief
   overview of the possible solutions.

   3) BGP based VPLS Multi-homing [draft-kothari-henderickx-l2vpn-vpls-
   multihoming]

   This is to use BGP as provisioning mechanism for multi-homing VPLS.

   4) There are also some ring solutions for MPLS-TP. But VPLS
   forwarding is closely related to Ethernet, these 2 are inherently
   different.



4. Ethernet Ring Based VPLS

4.1. Native Ethernet Ring

   There are some documents on this topic.

   In [ITU-T G.8032] Ethernet Ring Protection Switching, native Ethernet
   ring protection protocol and switching mechanism is defined.



Jiang                     Expires April 2010                   [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                VPLS RING                     October 2009


   In [RFC 3619] Ethernet Automatic Protection Switching, a similar
   design is presented.

   The main idea is to define a control node adjacent to a protection
   link. As shown in figure below, Node 1 is the control node and the
   link between 1 and 6 is the protection link.

    2 ----- 1 o---- 6                    2 ----- 1 ----- 6

    |      Ring     |        <---->      |      Ring     |

    3 ----- 4 ----- 5                    3 ----- 4 o---- 5

   Node 1 will block its port in the protection link to prevent loop.

   When there is link or node failure, node adjacent to the failure will
   detect the failure and inform the control node via protection control
   protocol. Or control node itself can do the job via fault detection
   protocol.

   When control node is informed, it will unblock the previously blocked
   port. When fault is cleared, control node will block the port again
   to prevent loop.

   In this example, when link between node 4 and 5 is broken, control
   node 1 will detect the failure and will unblock port in the
   protection link. When the failure is cleared, node 1 will block the
   port in protection link again.

                    N ----- N o---- N

                    |    Sub-ring   |

    N ----- N ----- 2 ----- 1 o---- 6 ----- N ----- N

    o    Sub-ring   |     Ring      |   Sub-ring    o

    N ----- N ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 ----- N ----- N

                    |    Sub-ring   |

                    N o---- N ----- N

   Interconnected rings are also supported, as shown above. This is a
   hierarchical structure of a ring and several sub-rings. Ring is
   viewed by sub-ring as a permanent link. Each sub-ring will run its
   own ring control protocol for loop prevention and protection.

Internet-Draft                VPLS RING                     October 2009


4.2. MPLS Services & Their Native Form

   MPLS provides a scalable encapsulation mechanism for multiple
   services. MPLS has been adapted by wide range of services including
   L3VPN, L2VPN (PW, VPLS), TE, FRR, multicast, QoS, BGP free core
   network, transport (MPLS-TP), etc.

   Some of these services are widely deployed and deemed a success, such
   as L3VPN, L2VPN (PW, VPLS), TE and FRR. Some are still under
   development, such as Transport and multicast. And some may have
   difficulty to take off, such as BGP free core.

   When we look at the winner, we can find that all successful MPLS
   services are successful in their native form, and vice versa.

   Native form of L3VPN is IP service, which is the foundation of
   Internet and broadband network. Native form of PW is legacy WAN
   services, which is dominant in traditional telecom world. Native form
   of VPLS is Ethernet, which is dominant in enterprise world.

   While multicast in its native form is not as widely deployed as
   unicast due to its inherent complexity. So does multicast in MPLS
   encapsulation.

   If we apply the same rule to Ethernet ring, we expect its native form
   to be deployed and accepted before its MPLS flavored version to be
   success.

4.3. CE-PE Ring

   (CE) ----- CE1 ------ PE1

    o          o          |

   (CE) ---- (CE2) ----- PE2

     :          :         |

   (CE)...... (CE)..... (PE)

   Ring is formed among CE and PE. It can be 1 CE & 2 PE ring, 2 CE &
   2PE ring, n CE & n PE ring. It can be single ring or interconnected
   rings. PW between PE is treated by PE as virtual link. Ethernet ring
   control protocol is running in CE and PE for loop prevention and
   protection. We can use this mechanism to build scalable and flexible
   VPLS access network. It is also the convenient way to build CE-PE
   multi-homing.

4.4. PE-PE Ring

                   PE ---- PE o --- PE

                    |    Sub-ring   |

    PE----- PE-----PE ---- PE o --- PE----- PE -----PE ----- CE

    O    Sub-ring   |     Ring      |   Sub-ring     o        |

    PE----- PE-----PE ---- PE ----- PE----- PE -----PE ----- CE

                    |    Sub-ring   |

                   PE o - PE ----- PE

   Ring can be among PEs. It can be single ring or interconnected rings.
   This design is simple & neat for service provider with ring
   fiber/cable resources. PE ring can also interconnect with CE-PE ring.

   Its forwarding process is different from that of VPLS. There is only
   1 bi-directional PW between each pair of PEs serving as virtual link.
   N PWs in this case compared with N*(N-1)/2 PWs in full mesh case for
   N nodes is one of the benefits, other benefits include customer
   multicast optimization, which will be explained in following section.
   There is also certain cost. In ring, each PE will turn on MAC
   learning. Ethernet packet will go through each PE in ring, and PE
   will forward Ethernet packet based on MAC forwarding table.

   The whole network is Ethernet ring using PW as virtual link between
   nodes. MPLS protection mechanism is used to protect the PW locally.
   Ethernet ring protection mechanism is used to protect the VPLS
   service. It is also the convenient way to build PE redundancy.

4.5. Inter-VPLS Ring

    (VPLS 1 Border PE) ----- (VPLS 2 Border PE) o --- (VPLS 2 Border PE)

           |                                                  |

    (VPLS 1 Border PE) ----- (VPLS 3 Border PE) ----- (VPLS 3 Border PE)

   Ring can also be used to provide inter-VPLS connection. Each VPLS can
   connect to other VPLS via border PE. inter-VPLS ring can also
   interconnect with PE ring or CE-PE ring. Protection mechanism is
   similar to PE ring. It also provides inter-VPLS PE redundancy.

4.6. Customer Multicast Traffic

            CE1 -----PE1 ==>== PE2 -->-- CE2

                      |        |

                      V        v

            CE3 -----PE3 ---- PE4 -->-- CE4

   In full mesh VPLS, there will be multiple copy of customer multicast
   traffic in inter-PE PW and waste the bandwidth.

   For example, multicast traffic from CE1 to CE2-4 will be sent in PW
   from PE1 to PE2-4. There will be 2 copies of traffic in link between
   PE1 and PE2. If the number of multicast receiving node is N, there
   will be copies of traffic along the root to leaf path from around N/2
   to 1.

   In ring VPLS, there will be only 1 copy of customer multicast traffic
   along the path from root to leaf. Its forwarding mechanism is similar
   to Ethernet multicast forwarding mechanism.

5. Security Considerations



6. IANA Considerations



7. Conclusions

   In this document, Ethernet ring based VPLS is presented. This
   architecture is most suitable to be deployed on infrastructure with
   fiber/cable ring. It can greatly reduce the number of inter-PE PWs in
   full mesh design. It can also eliminate the unnecessary copies of
   customer multicast traffic due to full mesh design. Ring can also
   provide a convenient way for node and link protection.
