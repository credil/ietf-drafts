               Indication of features supported by proxy
              draft-holmberg-sipcore-proxy-feature-00.txt

Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Caller Preferences" extension
   defined in RFC 3840 provides a mechanism that allows a SIP message to
   convey information relating to the originator's capabilities.  This
   document makes it possible for SIP proxies to convey similar
   information, by extending the rr-param rule defined in RFC 3261, so
   that the header field parameter can be used to convey feature tags
   that indicate features supported by the proxy.

Internet-Draft                proxy feature               September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The SIP "Caller Preferences" extension defined in RFC 3840 [RFC3840]
   provides a mechanism that allows a SIP message to convey information,
   using feature tags, relating to the originator's capabilities.

   Feature information can be useful for other SIP entities, that might
   trigger actions and enable functions based on features supported by
   other SIP entities.

   This document extends the rr-param rule defined in RFC 3261
   [RFC3261], so that it can be used to convey feature tags indicating
   support of features in SIP proxies.  The rr-param rule is used in the
   SIP Path, Route, Record-Route and Service-Route header fields.

1.1.  Use-case: IMS Service Continuity

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines a IP Multimedia
   Subsystem (IMS) Service Continuity mechanism [3GPP.23.237] for
   handover of Packet Switched (PS) sessions to Circuit Switched (CS).
   The handover can be performed by a Service Centralization and
   Continuity Application Server (SCC AS), or by a SCC AS together with
   an Access Transfer Control Function (ATCF), that acts as a SIP proxy.
   Delegating part of the session handover functionality to an ATCF
   provides advantages related to voice interruption during session
   handover etc, since it is located in the same network as the user.

   In order for a SCC AS to delegate part of the session handover
   functionality to an ATCF, when it receives a SIP REGISTER request, it
   needs to be informed whether there is a proxy that provides ATCF
   functionality in the registration path.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions

   The rr-param rule defined in RFC 3261 [RFC3261]:

   rr-param = generic-param

   is extended to:

Internet-Draft                proxy feature               September 2010


   rr-param = generic-param / feature-param

   where feature-param is defined in Section 9 of RFC 3840 [RFC3840].


4.  User Agent behavior

   This specification does not specify any new User Agent behavior.


5.  Proxy behavior

   When a proxy inserts a Path header field (during registration), a
   Service-Route header field (during registration) or a Record-Route
   header field (during a dialog establishment), it MAY insert a feature
   tag in the header field.

   If a feature tag is inserted in a Path or Service-Route header field
   during registration, the resource identified by the URI in the header
   field MUST provide support for the associated feature for all dialogs
   associated with the registration, until the registration is
   terminated or re-freshed.

   If a feature tag is inserted in a Record-Route header field during a
   dialog establishment, the resource identified by the URI in the
   header field MUST provide support for the associated feature until
   the dialog is terminated.


6.  Feature tag semantics

   The feature tag in a header field constructed using rr-param rule
   indicates support of the feature in the resource identified by the
   URI in the header field.

   In order to insert a feature tag in a SIP header field constructed by
   using rr-param rule, the feature specification MUST specify the
   semantics of the feature tag when inserted in that specific header
   field.  Unless the feature specification defines such semantics, a
   the feature tag MUST NOT be included in that specific header field.

   NOTE: If a route set is built using Path, Record-Route or Service-
   Route header fields, any inserted feature tag will be copied into the
   associated Route header fields, together with other header field
   parameters.  This specification does not define any specific meaning
   of the feature tags present in Route header fields in such cases.

8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD


9.  Security Considerations

   Feature tags can provide sensitive information about a SIP entity.
   RFC 3840 cautions against providing sensitive information to another
   party.  Once this information is given out, any use may be made of
   it.
