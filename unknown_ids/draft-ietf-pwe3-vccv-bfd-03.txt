Internet-Draft                  BFD VCCV                   February 2009


1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The reader is expected to be familiar with the terminology and
   abbreviations defined in [RFC5085].


2.  Introduction

   This document describes new Connectivity Verification (CV) types
   using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) with Virtual Circuit
   Connectivity Verification (VCCV).  VCCV [RFC5085] provides a control
   channel that is associated with a Pseudowire (PW), as well as the
   corresponding operations and management functions such as
   connectivity/fault verification to be used over that control channel.

   BFD [I-D.ietf-bfd-base] is used over the VCCV control channel
   primarily as a pseudowire fault detection mechanism, for detecting
   dataplane failures.  Some BFD CV Types can additionally carry fault
   status between the endpoints of the pseudowire.  Furthermore, this
   information can then be translated into the native OAM status codes
   used by the native access technologies, such as ATM, Frame-Relay or
   Ethernet.  The specific details of such status interworking are out
   of the scope of this document, and are only noted here to illustrate
   the utility of BFD over VCCV for such purposes.  Those details can be
   found in [I-D.ietf-pwe3-oam-msg-map].

   The new BFD CV Types are PW Demultiplexer-agnostic, and hence
   applicable for both MPLS and L2TPv3 Pseudowire Demultiplexers.  This
   document concerns itself with the BFD VCCV operation over Single-
   Segment Pseudowires (SS-PW).  This specification describes procedures
   only for BFD asynchronous mode.


3.  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection Connectivity Verification

   VCCV can support several Connectivity Verification (CV) types.  This
   section defines new CV Types for use when BFD is used as the VCCV
   payload.

   The CV Type is defined as a bitmask field used to indicate the
   specific CV Type or Types (i.e., none, one or more) of VCCV packets
   that may be sent on the VCCV control channel.  The values shown below
   augment those already defined in [RFC5085].  They represent the
   numerical value corresponding to the actual bit being set in the CV

   Type bitfield.

   BFD CV Types:

      The defined values for the different BFD CV Types for MPLS and
      L2TPv3 PWs are:

      Bit (Value)   Description
      ============  ====================================================
      Bit 2 (0x04)  BFD IP/UDP-encapsulated, for PW Fault Detection only
      Bit 3 (0x08)  BFD IP/UDP-encapsulated, for PW Fault Detection and
                    AC/PW Fault Status Signaling
      Bit 4 (0x10)  BFD PW-ACH-encapsulated, for PW Fault Detection only
      Bit 5 (0x20)  BFD PW-ACH-encapsulated, for PW Fault Detection and
                    AC/PW Fault Status Signaling

   It should be noted that four BFD CV Types have been defined by
   permutation of their encapsulation and functionality, see
   Section 3.3.

3.1.  BFD CV Type Operation

   When heart-beat indication is necessary for one or more PWs, the
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [I-D.ietf-bfd-base] provides
   a means of continuous monitoring of the PW data path and, in some
   operational modes, propagation of forward and reverse defect
   indications.

   In order to use BFD, both ends of the PW connection need to agree on
   the BFD CV Type to use:

      For statically provisioned pseudowires, both ends need to be
      statically configured to use the same BFD CV Type (in addition to
      be statically configured for VCCV with the same CC Type).

      For dynamically established pseudowires, both ends of the PW must
      have signaled the existence of a control channel and the ability
      to run BFD on it (see Section 3.3 and Section 4).

   Once a node has selected a valid BFD CV Type to use (either
   statically provisioned or selected dynamically after the node has
   both signaled and received signaling from its peer of these
   capabilities), it begins sending BFD control packets.

   The BFD control packets are sent on the VCCV control channel.  The
   use of the VCCV control channel provides the context required to bind
   and bootstrap the BFD session, since discriminator values are not
   exchanged; the pseudowire demultiplexer field (e.g., MPLS PW Label or



Nadeau & Pignataro       Expires August 22, 2009                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  BFD VCCV                   February 2009


   L2TPv3 Session ID) provides the context to demultiplex the first BFD
   control packet, and thus single-hop BFD initialization procedures are
   followed (see Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-bfd-v4v6-1hop] and Section 6 of
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-generic]).  A single BFD session exists per-pseudowire.
   Both PW endpoints take the Active role sending initial BFD Control
   packets with a "Your Discriminator" field of zero, and BFD Control
   packets received with a "Your Discriminator" field of zero are
   associated to the BFD session bound to the PW.  BFD MUST be run in
   asynchronous mode (see [I-D.ietf-bfd-base]).

   The operation of BFD VCCV for PWs is therefore symmetrical.  Both
   endpoints of the bidirectional pseudowire MUST send BFD messages on
   the VCCV control channel.

   When the downstream PE (D-PE) does not receive BFD control messages
   from its upstream peer PE (U-PE) during a certain number of
   transmission intervals (a number provisioned by the operator as
   Detect Mult), D-PE declares that the PW in its receive direction is
   down.  In other words, D-PE enters the "forward defect" state for
   this PW.  After this calculated Detection Time, D-PE declares the
   session Down, and signals this to the remote end via the State (Sta)
   with Diagnostic code 1 (Control Detection Time Expired).  In turn,
   U-PE declares the PW is down in its transmit direction setting the
   State to Down, and it using Diagnostic code 3 (Neighbor signaled
   session down) in its control messages to D-PE.  U-PE enters the
   "reverse defect" state for this PW.  If needed, how it further
   processes this error condition, and conveys this status to the
   attachment circuits is out of the scope of this specification, and is
   instead defined in [I-D.ietf-pwe3-oam-msg-map].

   The VCCV message comprises a BFD Control packet [I-D.ietf-bfd-base]
   encapsulated as specified by the CV Type (see Section 3.2).

3.2.  BFD Encapsulation

   There are two ways in which a BFD connectivity verification packet
   may be encapsulated over the VCCV control channel.  This document
   defines four BFD CV Types (see Section 3), which can be grouped into
   two pairs of BFD CV Types from an encapsulation point of view.
   Table 1 in Section 3.3 summarizes the BFD CV Types.

   o  IP/UDP BFD Encapsulation (BFD with IP/UDP Headers)

      In the first method, the VCCV encapsulation of BFD includes the
      IP/UDP headers as defined in Section 4 of
      [I-D.ietf-bfd-v4v6-1hop].  BFD Control packets are therefore
      transmitted in UDP with destination port 3784 and source port
      within the rage 49152 through 65535.  The IP Protocol Number and



Nadeau & Pignataro       Expires August 22, 2009                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  BFD VCCV                   February 2009


      UDP Port numbers discriminate among the possible VCCV payloads
      (i.e., differentiate among ICMP Ping and LSP Ping defined in
      [RFC5085] and BFD).

      The IP version (IPv4 or IPv6) matches the IP version used for
      signaling for dynamically established pseudowires, or is
      configured for statically provisioned pseudowires.  The source IP
      address is an address of the sender.  The destination IP address
      is a (randomly chosen) IPv4 address from the range 127/8 or IPv6
      address from the range 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:127.0.0.0/104.  The
      rationale is explained in Section 2.1 of [RFC4379].  The Time to
      Live/Hop Limit procedures from Section 5 of
      [I-D.ietf-bfd-v4v6-1hop] apply to this encapsulation, and hence
      the TTL/Hop Limit is set to 255.  In this encapsulation, the BFD
      CV Type used in signaling (if used) is either 0x04 or 0x08.

   o  PW-ACH BFD Encapsulation (BFD without IP/UDP Headers)

      In the second method, a BFD Control packet (format defined in
      Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-bfd-base]) is encapsulated directly in the
      VCCV control channel (see Sections 6 and 8 of
      [I-D.ietf-bfd-generic]) and the IP/UDP headers are omitted from
      the BFD encapsulation.  Therefore, to utilize this encapsulation,
      a pseudowire MUST use the PW Associated Channel Header (PW-ACH)
      Control Word format for its Control Word (CW) or L2-Specific
      Sublayer (L2SS, used in L2TPv3).

      In this encapsulation, a "raw" BFD Control packet follows directly
      the PW-ACH, and the PW-ACH Channel Type identifies "raw" BFD.  The
      PW Associated Channel (PWAC) is defined in Section 5 of [RFC4385],
      and its Channel Type field is used as a payload type identifier to
      discriminate the VCCV payload types.

      The usage of the PW-ACH on different VCCV CC Types is specified
      for CC Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 respectively in Sections 5.1.1,
      5.1.2 and 5.1.3 of [RFC5085], in all cases depending on the use of
      a CW.  When VCCV carries raw BFD, the PW-ACH (Pseudowire CW's or
      L2SS') Channel Type MUST be set to 0x0007 to indicate "BFD
      Control, PW-ACH-encapsulated" (i.e., BFD Without IP/UDP Headers,
      see Section 5.2), to allow the identification of the encased BFD
      payload when demultiplexing the VCCV control channel.  In this
      case, the BFD CV Type employed in signaling (if used) is either
      0x10 or 0x20.

   In summary, for the IP/UDP encapsulation of BFD (BFD with IP/UDP
   headers), if a PW Associated Channel Header is used, the Channel Type
   can indicate IPv4 (0x0021) or IPv6 (0x0057).  For the PW-ACH
   encapsulation of BFD (BFD without IP/UDP headers), the PW Associated

Internet-Draft                  BFD VCCV                   February 2009


   Channel Header MUST be used and indicates BFD Control packet
   (0x0007).

3.3.  CV Types for BFD

   Four CV Types are defined for BFD.  Table 1 summarizes the BFD CV
   Types, grouping them by encapsulation (i.e., with and without IP/UDP
   headers) and by functionality (i.e., fault detection only, or fault
   detection and status signaling).

   +----------------------------+--------------+-----------------------+
   |                            |     Fault    |  Fault Detection and  |
   |                            |   Detection  |    Status Signaling   |
   |                            |     Only     |                       |
   +----------------------------+--------------+-----------------------+
   |  BFD, IP/UDP encapsulation |     0x04     |          0x08         |
   |      (with IP/UDP Headers) |              |                       |
   |                            |              |                       |
   |  BFD, PW-ACH encapsulation |     0x10     |          0x20         |
   |   (without IP/UDP Headers) |              |                       |
   +----------------------------+--------------+-----------------------+

                 Table 1: Bitmask Values for BFD CV Types

   Given the bidirectional nature of BFD, before selecting a given BFD
   CV Type capability to be used in dynamically established pseudowires,
   there MUST be common CV Types in the VCCV capability advertised and
   received.  That is, only BFD CV Types that were both advertised and
   received are available to be selected.  Additionally, only one BFD CV
   Type can be used (selecting a BFD CV Type excludes all the remaining
   BFD CV Types).

   The following list enumerates rules, restrictions and clarifications
   on the usage of BFD CV Types:

   1.  BFD CV Types used for fault detection and status signaling (i.e.,
       CV Types 0x08 and 0x20) SHOULD NOT be used when a control
       protocol such as LDP [RFC4447] or L2TPV3 [RFC3931] is available
       that can signal the AC/PW status to the remote endpoint of the
       PW.  More details can be found in [I-D.ietf-pwe3-oam-msg-map].

   2.  BFD CV Types used for fault detection only (i.e., CV Types 0x04
       and 0x10) can be used whether a protocol that can signal AC/PW
       status is available or not.  This includes both statically
       provisioned and dynamically signaled pseudowires.

       A.  In this case, BFD is used exclusively to detect faults on the
           PW; if it is desired to convey AC/PW fault status, some means



Nadeau & Pignataro       Expires August 22, 2009                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  BFD VCCV                   February 2009


           other than BFD are to be used.  Examples include using LDP
           status messages when using MPLS as a transport (see Section
           5.4 of [RFC4447]), and the Circuit Status AVP in an L2TPv3
           SLI message for L2TPv3 (see Section 5.4.5 of [RFC3931]).

   3.  Pseudowires that do not use a CW or L2SS using the PW Associated
       Channel Header MUST NOT use the BFD CV Types 0x10 or 0x20 (i.e.,
       PW-ACH encapsulation of BFD, without IP/UDP headers).

       A.  PWs that use a PW-ACH include CC Type 1 (for both MPLS and
           L2TPv3 as defined in Sections 5.1.1 and 6.1 of [RFC5085]),
           and MPLS CC Types 2 and 3 when using a Control Word (as
           specified in Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3 of [RFC5085]).  This
           restriction stems from the fact that the PW-ACH contains a
           Protocol Identification (PID) field, the Channel Type.

       B.  PWs that do not use a PW-ACH can use the VCCV BFD
           encapsulation with IP/UDP headers, including its concurrent
           use along with another CV Type that uses an encapsulation
           with IP headers (e.g., ICMP Ping or LSP Ping).  For example,
           as specified in Section 7 of [RFC4385], a Pseudowire
           operating without CW MUST NOT use the PW-ACH.

   4.  Only a single BFD CV Type can be selected and used.  All BFD CV
       Types are mutually exclusive with the rest, after selecting a BFD
       CV Type, a node MUST NOT use any of the other three BFD CV Types.


4.  Capability Selection

   The precedence rules for selection of various CC and CV Types is
   clearly outlined in Section 7 of [RFC5085].  This section augments
   these rules when the BFD CV Types defined herein are supported.  The
   selection of a specific BFD CV Type to use out of the four available
   CV Types defined is tied to multiple factors, as hinted in
   Section 3.3.  Given that BFD is bidirectional in nature, only CV
   Types that are both received and sent in VCCV capability signaling
   advertisement can be selected.

   There may be more than one CV Type available for selection after
   considering the intersection of advertised and received BFD CV Types,
   and applying the rules in Section 3.3.  For these cases were multiple
   BFD CV Types are available for selection, the following precedence
   order applies when choosing the single BFD CV Type to use.  The
   lowest numbered item (where both ends have set the indicated flag and
   such flag is allowed by the rules above) is used:

   1.  0x20 - BFD PW-ACH-encapsulated (without IP/UDP headers), for PW
       Fault Detection and AC/PW Fault Status Signaling

   2.  0x10 - BFD PW-ACH-encapsulated (without IP/UDP headers), for PW
       Fault Detection only

   3.  0x08 - BFD IP/UDP-encapsulated, for PW Fault Detection and AC/PW
       Fault Status Signaling

   4.  0x04 - BFD IP/UDP-encapsulated, for PW Fault Detection only

   This precedence order prioritizes superset of functionality and
   simplicity of encapsulation.


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  MPLS CV Types for the VCCV Interface Parameters Sub-TLV

   The VCCV Interface Parameters Sub-TLV codepoint is defined in
   [RFC4446], and the VCCV CV Types registry is defined in [RFC5085].
   This section lists the new BFD CV Types.

   IANA is requested to augment the "VCCV Connectivity Verification
   Types" registry in the Pseudo Wires Name Spaces, reachable from
   [IANA.pwe3-parameters].  These are bitfield values.  CV Type values
   0x04 0x08, 0x10 and 0x20 are specified in Section 3.

5.2.  PW Associated Channel Type

   The PW Associated Channel Types used by VCCV rely on previously
   allocated numbers from the Pseudowire Associated Channel Types
   Registry [RFC4385] in the Pseudo Wires Name Spaces reachable from
   [IANA.pwe3-parameters].  In particular, 0x21 (Internet Protocol
   version 4) is used whenever an IPv4 payload follows the Pseudowire
   Associated Channel Header, or 0x57 is used when an IPv6 payload

   follows the Pseudowire Associated Channel Header.

   In cases where a raw BFD Control packet follows the Pseudowire
   Associated Channel as specified in Section 3.2 (i.e., when using the
   PW-ACH-encapsulated BFD without IP/UDP headers), a new "Pseudowire
   Associated Channel Types" Registry [RFC4385] entry of 0x07 is used.
   IANA is requested to reserve a new Pseudowire Associated Channel Type
   value as follows:


     Value (in hex)  Protocol Name                      Reference

                     (without IP/UDP Headers)

5.3.  L2TPv3 CV Types for the VCCV Capability AVP

   This section lists the new BFD CV Types to be added to the existing
   "VCCV Capability AVP" registry in the L2TP name spaces.  The Layer
   Two Tunneling Protocol "L2TP" Name Spaces are reachable from
   [IANA.l2tp-parameters].

   IANA is requested to reserve the following L2TPv3 Connectivity
   Verification (CV) Types in the VCCV Capability AVP Values registry.

6.  Congestion Considerations

   The congestion considerations that apply to [RFC5085] apply to this
   mode of operation as well.

7.  Security Considerations

   Routers that implement the additional CV Types defined herein are
   subject to the same security considerations as defined in [RFC5085],
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-base], and [I-D.ietf-bfd-v4v6-1hop].  This
   specification does not raise any additional security issues beyond
   these.  The IP/UDP-encapsulated BFD makes use of the TTL/Hop Limit
   procedures described in Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-bfd-v4v6-1hop],
   including the use of the Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM) as
   a security mechanism.
