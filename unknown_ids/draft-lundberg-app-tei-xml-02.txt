Internet-Draft     The 'application/tei+xml' mediatype        April 2010


1.  Introduction

   The TEI is an international and interdisciplinary standard that is
   widely used by libraries, museums, publishers, and individual
   scholars to represent all kinds of textual material for online
   research and teaching.  [TEI]

   In order to increase the possibilities for generic XML processing
   this document defines the 'application/tei+xml' media type in
   accordance with [RFC3023].

2.  Registration of MIME type 'application/tei+xml'

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: tei+xml

      Required parameters: None

      Optional parameters: charset

         Identical with charset in [RFC3023]

      Encoding considerations:

         By virtue of TEI XML content being XML, it has the same
         considerations when sent as 'application/tei+xml' as does XML
         in general.  See RFC 3023 [RFC3023], Section 3.2.

      Security considerations:

         TEI elements may refer to arbitrary URIs.  Hence the security
         issues of [RFC3986], section 7, apply.  See also Security
         considerations (Section 5)

      Interoperability considerations: None.

      Published specification:

         This media type registration is for TEI documents as described
         in the TEI Guidelines[TEI].

      Applications which use this media type:

         There are currently no applications using the media type
         'application/tei+xml'.  It will be an entirely new type which
         is registered in order to allow for the deployment of TEI on
         the World Wide Web as a first class XML application.

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s):

            There is no single initial octet sequence that is always
            present in TEI documents.

         file extension(s):

            TEI documents have most often the extension '.xml'.  Other
            common extensions are '.tei', '.teiCorpus' and '.odd'.

         Macintosh File Type Code(s)

            TEXT

         Object Identifier(s) or OID(s)

            Not applicable

3.  Recognizing TEI files

   TEI files are XML documents or fragments having the root element in a
   TEI namespace, i.e., a namespace URI starting with
   http://www.tei-c.org/ns/.  This URI is followed by a version number,
   corresponding to the major release of the TEI schema.  The current
   namespace is http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0

   In general, a [TEI] file usually contains either of the strings

      <tei

      <TEI

   near the beginning.

   Examples:

      Frequently, the actual XML content of TEI files will contain <TEI
      somewhere early on.

      More specialized types of documents may start with a lower case
      tei as in <teiCorpus.

4.  Fragment identifier

   Documents having the media type 'application/tei+xml', use the
   fragment identifier notation in the same way as does 'application/
   xml'.  This is specified in [RFC3023] or its successors.

5.  Security considerations

   An XML resource identifier does not in itself compromise data
   security.  When converted to IRIs or URIs and used to provide access
   to network resources, care must be taken to properly interpret the
   data to prevent unintended access.

   Any application accepting submitted or retrieves TEI XML for
   processing has to be aware of risks connected with injection of
   harmful scripts and executable XML.  Even common XML inclusion or the
   use of external entities, could potentially be used to reveal aspects
   of a service that may compromise its security.  Any vulnerability of
   these kinds are, however, application specific.  The TEI namespaces
   do not contain such elements.
