Internet-Draft  MPLS On-demand Connectivity Verification   February 2011


1.  Introduction

   LSP-Ping [RFC4379] is an OAM mechanism for MPLS LSPs.  This document
   describes extensions to LSP-Ping so that LSP-Ping can be used for on-
   demand monitoring of MPLS-TP LSPs.  It also clarifies the procedures
   to be used for processing the OAM packets.  This document describes
   how LSP-Ping can be used for on-demand Connectivity Verification
   (Section 3) and Route Tracing (Section 4) functions required in
   [RFC5860] and specified in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework].

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In addition, there is considerable opportunity for confusion in use
   of the terms "on-demand connectivity verification" (CV), "on-demand
   route tracing" and "LSP-Ping."  In this document, we try to use the
   terms consistently as follows:

   LSP-Ping: refers to the mechanism - particularly as defined and used
   in referenced material;

   On-demand CV: refers to on-demand connectivity verification and -
   where both apply equally - on-demand route tracing as implemmented
   using the LSP-Ping mechanism as extended for support of MPLS-TP;

   On-demand route tracing: used in those cases where the LSP-Ping
   mechanism (as extended) is used exclusively for route tracing.

1.2.  On-demand CV for MPLS-TP LSPs using IP encapsulation

   LSP-Ping requires IP addressing on the egress and transit LSRs for
   performing OAM on MPLS signaled LSPs and pseudowires.  In particular,
   in these cases the LSP-Ping packets generated by an ingress LSR are
   encapsulated in an IP/UDP header with the destination address from
   the 127/8 range and then encapsulated in the MPLS label stack
   ([RFC4379] , [RFC5884]).  Egress LSRs use the presence of the 127/8
   destination address to identify the OAM packets and rely further on
   the UDP port number to determine whether the packet is a LSP-Ping
   packet.  It is to be noted that this determination does not require
   IP forwarding capabilities.  It requires the presence of an IP host
   stack which enables egress LSRs to process packets with a destination
   address from the 127/8 range.  [RFC1122] allocates the 127/8 range as
   "Internal host loopback address" and [RFC1812] states that "a router
   SHOULD NOT forward, except over a loopback interface, any packet that
   has a destination address on network 127".

1.3.  On-demand CV for MPLS-TP LSPs using non-IP encapsulation

   In certain MPLS-TP deployment scenarios IP addressing might not be
   available or it may be preferred to use some form of non-IP
   encapsulation for On-demand CV, route tracing and BFD packets.  In
   such scenarios, On-demand CV and/or route tracing SHOULD be run
   without IP addressing, using the ACH channel type specified in
   Section 3.

   Section 3.3 and Section 4.2 describe the theory of operation for
   performing On-demand CV over MPLS-TP LSPs with any non-IP
   encapsulation.


2.  LSP-Ping Extensions

2.1.  New address type for Downstream Mapping TLV

   [RFC4379] defines the Downstream Mapping TLV.  This document defines
   the following new Address type which is added to the Downstream
   Mapping TLV:

         Type #        Address Type           K Octets
         ------        --------------         --------
             0         Not Applicable                8


             Figure 1: Downstream Mapping TLV new address type

   The new address type indicates that no address is present in the
   Downstream Mapping TLV.  Multipath type SHOULD be set to 0 (no
   multipath) when using this address type.

   When this address type is used, on receipt of a LSP-Ping echo
   request, interface verification MUST be bypassed.  Thus the receiving
   node SHOULD only perform mpls label control-plane/data-plane
   consistency checks.

   The new address type is also applicable to the Detailed Downstream
   Mapping TLV defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-enhanced-dsmap].

2.2.  Source Address TLV

   When sending On-demand CV packets using ACH, without IP
   encapsulation, there MAY be a need to identify the source address of
   the packet.  This source address will be specified via the Source
   Address TLV, being defined in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-ach-tlv].  An On-
   demand CV packet MUST NOT include more than 1 source address TLV.



Bahadur, et al.          Expires August 8, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  MPLS On-demand Connectivity Verification   February 2011


   The source address MUST specify the address of the originator of the
   packet.  If more than 1 such TLV is present in an On-demand CV
   request packet, then an error of 1 (Malformed echo request received,
   Section 3.3 [RFC4379]) MUST be returned, if it is possible to
   unambiguously identify the source of the packet.

2.3.  MEP and MIP Identifier

   When sending On-demand CV packets using ACH, there MAY be a need to
   identify the maintenance end point (MEP) and/or the maintenance
   intermediate point (MIP) targetted for the transport path monitored
   (see [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-rosetta-stone]).  MEP/MIP identifiers defined
   in [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers] MAY be included in the ACH for this
   purpose.  The ACH TLV (see [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-ach-tlv]) MUST NOT
   include more than one targetted MEP/MIP identifier.  The MEP/MIP
   identifier associated with the packet MUST be checked for the MPLS-TP
   transport path that is being monitored.  If the identifier does not
   match, then the packet MUST be dropped.

2.4.  Identifying Statically provisioned LSPs and PWs

   [RFC4379] specifies how an MPLS LSP under test may be identified in
   an echo request.  A Target FEC Stack TLV is used to identify the LSP.
   In order to identify a statically provisioned LSP and PW, new target
   FEC stack sub-TLVs are being defined.  The new sub-TLVs are assigned
   sub-type identifiers as follows, and are described in the following
   sections.

         Type #   Sub-Type #       Length        Value Field
         ------   ----------       ------        -----------
           1         22              24          Static LSP
           1         23              24          Static Pseudowire

   fields are taken from the definitions in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers].  The AC-ID definitions are taken from
   [RFC5003].


3.  Performing On-demand CV over MPLS-TP LSPs

   This section specifies how On-demand CV can be used in the context of
   MPLS-TP LSPs.  The On-demand CV function meets the On-demand
   Connectivity Verification requirements specified in [RFC5860],
   section 2.2.3.  This function SHOULD NOT be performed except in the
   on-demand mode.  This function SHOULD be performed between End Points
   (MEPs) and Intermediate Points (MIPs) of PWs and LSPs, and between
   End Points of PWs, LSPs and Sections.  In order for the On-demand CV
   packet to be processed at the desired MIP, the TTL of the MPLS label
   should be set such that it expires at the MIP to be probed.

   [RFC5586] defines an ACH mechanism for MPLS LSPs.  The mechanism is a
   generalization of Associated Channel mechanism that [RFC4385] defined
   for use with Pseudowires.  As a result, a single Associated Channel
   Type may be used for either an LSP or Pseudowire.

   A new Pseudowire Associated Channel Type (type TBD-2) is defined for
   use in performing On-demand Connectivity Verification.  Its use is
   described in the following sections.

3.1.  LSP-Ping with IP encapsulation

   LSP-Ping packets, as specified in [RFC4379], are sent over the MPLS
   LSP for which OAM is being performed and contain an IP/UDP packet
   within them.  The IP header is not used for forwarding (since LSP
   forwarding is done using MPLS label switching).  The IP header is
   used mainly for addressing and can be used in the context of MPLS-TP
   LSPs.  This form of On-demand CV OAM MUST be supported for MPLS-TP
   LSPs when IP addressing is in use.

   The On-demand CV echo response message MUST be sent on the reverse
   path of the LSP.  The reply MUST contain IP/UDP headers followed by
   the On-demand CV payload.  The destination address in the IP header
   MUST be set to that of the sender of the echo request message.  The
   source address in the IP address MUST be set to a valid address of
   the replying node.

3.2.  On-demand CV with IP encapsulation, over ACH

   IP encapsulated On-demand CV packets MAY be sent over the MPLS LSP
   using the control channel (ACH).  IP ACH type specified in [RFC4385]
   MUST be used in such a case.  The IP header is used mainly for

   addressing and can be used in the context of MPLS-TP LSPs.

   The On-demand CV echo response message SHOULD be sent on the reverse
   path of the LSP using ACH and SHOULD be IP encapsulated.  The
   destination address in the IP header MUST be set to that of the
   sender of the echo request message.  The source address in the IP
   address MUST be set to a valid address of the replying node.

3.3.  Non-IP based On-demand CV, using ACH

   The OAM procedures defined in [RFC4379] require the use of IP
   addressing, and in some cases IP routing, to perform OAM functions.
   When the ACH header is used, IP addressing and routing is not needed.
   This section describes procedures for performing on-demand CV without
   a dependency on IP addressing and routing.

   When using On-demand CV via LSP-Ping with the ACH header, the LSP-
   Ping Reply mode [RFC4379] in the LSP-Ping echo request MUST be set to
   4 (Reply via application level control channel).

   Note that the application level control channel in this case is the
   reverse path of the LSP (or Pseudowire) using ACH.

   The requesting node MAY attach a Source Address TLV (Section 2.2) to
   identify the node originating the request.

   The On-demand CV reply message MUST be sent on the reverse path of
   the LSP using ACH.  The On-demand CV payload MUST directly follow the
   ACH header (and any ACH TLVs) and no IP and/or UDP headers MUST be
   attached.  The responding node MAY attach a Source Address TLV to
   identify the node sending the response.

   If a node receives an MPLS echo request packet over ACH, without IP/
   UDP headers, with a reply mode of 4, and if that node does not have a
   return MPLS LSP path to the echo request source, then the node SHOULD
   drop the echo request packet and not attempt to send a response.

   If a node receives an MPLS echo request with a reply mode other than
   4 (reply via application level control channel), and if the node
   supports that reply mode, then it MAY respond using that reply mode.
   If the node does not support the reply mode requested, or is unable
   to reply using the requested reply mode in any specific instance, the
   node MUST drop the echo request packet and not attempt to send a
   response.

3.4.  Reverse Path Connectivity Verification

3.4.1.  Requesting Reverse Path Connectivity Verification

   A new global flag, Validate Reverse Path (R), is being defined in the
   LSP-Ping packet header.  When this flag is set in the echo request,
   the LSP-egress SHOULD return reverse path FEC information, as
   described in Section 3.4.2.

   The R flag MUST NOT be set in the echo response.  If it is set in the
   echo response, it should be ignored.

   The Global Flags field is now a bit vector with the following format:


                 0                   1
                 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                |             MBZ         |R|T|V|
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                                 Figure 5

   The V flag is defined in [RFC4379].  The T flag is defined in P2MP-
   LSP-PING.  The R flag is defined in this draft.

   The Validate FEC Stack (V) flag MAY be set in the echo response when
   reverse path connectivity verification is being performed.

3.4.2.  Egress Procedures

   When the R flag is set in the echo request, the egress node MAY
   attach a new TLV, Reverse-path target FEC stack TLV, in the echo
   response.  The requesting node (on receipt of the response) can use
   the Reverse-path target FEC stack TLV to perform reverse path
   connectivity verification.  For co-routed bi-directional LSPs, the
   Reverse-path target FEC stack used for On-demand CV will be the same
   in both the forward and reverse path of the LSP.  For associated bi-
   directional LSPs, the target FEC stack will be different for the
   reverse path.

   The format of the Reverse-path target FEC stack TLV is the same as
   that of the Target FEC stack TLV defined in [RFC4379].  The rules for
   creating a Target FEC stack TLV also apply to the Reverse-path target
   FEC stack TLV.

                                 Figure 6

3.4.3.  Ingress Procedures

   On receipt of the echo response, the requesting node MUST perform the
   following checks:

   1.  Perform interface and label-stack validation to ensure that the
       packet is received on the reverse path of the bi-directional LSP
   2.  If the Reverse-Path target FEC stack stack TLV is present in the
       echo response, then perform FEC validation.

   If any of the validations fail, then the requesting node MUST drop
   the echo response and report an error.

3.5.  P2MP Considerations

   [I-D.ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping] describes how LSP-Ping can be used for
   OAM on P2MP LSPs with IP encapsulation.  This MUST be supported for
   MPLS-TP P2MP LSPs when IP addressing is used.  When IP addressing is
   not used, then the procedures described in Section 3.3 can be applied
   to P2MP MPLS-TP LSPs as well.

3.6.  Operation of On-demand CV with Static MPLS-TP

   Support for static MPLS-TP LSP, or Pseudowire, usage and on-demand
   CV, requires manageable objects necessary to, for instance, configure
   operating parameters such as duration and periodicity of an on-demand
   connectivity test.

   The specifics of this manageability requirement are out-of-scope in
   this document and SHOULD be addressed in an appropriate management
   specification.

3.7.  GAL Label Processing

   At the ingress PE, when encapsulating the LSP echo request (LSP Ping)
   packet (with the IP or the non IP ACH codepoint), a GAL label MUST be
   added before adding the MPLS LSP label, and sending the LSP Ping echo
   request packet in-band in the MPLS LSP.

   The GAL label MUST NOT be considered as part of the MPLS label stack
   that requires verification by the egress PE.  For this reason, a NIL

Internet-Draft  MPLS On-demand Connectivity Verification   February 2011


   FEC Stack TLV SHOULD NOT be added or associated with the GAL label.


4.  Performing on-demand Route Tracing over MPLS-TP LSPs

   This section specifies how On-demand CV traceroute can be used in the
   context of MPLS-TP LSPs.  The On-demand CV traceroute function meets
   the Route Tracing requirement specified in [RFC5860], section 2.2.4.
   This function SHOULD be performed on-demand.  This function SHOULD be
   performed between End Points and Intermediate Points of PWs and LSPs,
   and between End Points of PWs, LSPs and Sections.

   When performing On-demand CV traceroute, the requesting node inserts
   a Downstream Mapping TLV to get the downstream node information and
   to enable LSP verification along the transit nodes.  The Downstream
   Mapping TLV can be used as is for performing the traceroute.  If IP
   addressing is not in use, then the Address Type field in the
   Downstream Mapping TLV can be set to "Not applicable" (Section 2.1).
   The Downstream Mapping TLV address type field can be extended to
   include other address types as need be.

4.1.  On-demand LSP Route Tracing with IP encapsulation

   The mechanics of On-demand CV traceroute are similar to those
   described for ping in Section 3.1.  On-demand Route Tracing packets
   sent by the LSP ingress MUST follow procedures described in
   [RFC4379].  This form of On-demand CV OAM MUST be supported for
   MPLS-TP LSPs, when IP addressing is used.

4.2.  Non-IP based On-demand LSP Route Tracing, using ACH

   This section describes procedures for performing LSP traceroute when
   using LSP-Ping with the ACH header and without any dependency on IP
   addressing.  The procedures specified in Section 3.3 with regards to
   Source Address TLV, MEP/MIP identifiers apply to LSP traceroute as
   well.

4.2.1.  Ingress node procedure for sending echo request packets

   On-demand Route Tracing packets sent by the LSP ingress MUST adhere
   to the format described in Section 3.3.  MPLS-TTL expiry (as
   described in [RFC4379]) will be used to direct the packets to
   specific nodes along the LSP path.

4.2.2.  Ingress node procedure for receiving echo response packets

   The On-demand CV traceroute responses will be received on the LSP
   itself and the presence of an ACH header with channel type of On-

Internet-Draft  MPLS On-demand Connectivity Verification   February 2011


   demand CV is an indicator that the packet contains On-demand CV
   payload.

4.2.3.  Transit and egress node procedure

   When a echo request reaches the transit or egress, the presence of
   the ACH channel type of On-demand CV will indicate that the packet
   contains On-demand CV data.  The On-demand CV data, the label stack
   and the MEP/MIP identifier should be sufficient to identify the LSP
   associated with the echo request packet.  If there is an error and
   the node is unable to identify the LSP on which the echo response
   would to be sent, the node MUST drop the echo request packet and not
   send any response back.  All responses MUST always be sent on a LSP
   path using the ACH header and ACH channel type of On-demand CV.

4.3.  P2MP Considerations

   [I-D.ietf-mpls-p2mp-lsp-ping] describes how LSP-Ping can be used for
   OAM on P2MP LSPs.  This MUST be supported for MPLS-TP P2MP LSPs when
   IP addressing is used.  When IP addressing is not used, then the
   procedures described in Section 4.2 can be applied to P2MP MPLS-TP
   LSPs as well.

4.4.  ECMP Considerations

   On-demand CV using ACH SHOULD NOT be used when there is ECMP (equal
   cost multiple paths) for a given LSP.  The addition of the additional
   ACH header may modify the hashing behavior for OAM packets which may
   result in incorrect monitoring of path taken by data traffic.


5.  Applicability

   The procedures specified in this document for non-IP encapsulation
   apply only to MPLS-TP Transport paths.  This includes LSPs and PWs
   when IP encapsulation is not desired.  However, when IP addressing is
   used, as in non MPLS-TP LSPs, procedures specified in [RFC4379] MUST
   be used.


6.  Security Considerations

   The draft does not introduce any new security considerations.  Those
   discussed in [RFC4379] are also applicable to this document.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  New Target FEC Stack Sub-TLVs

   Section 2.4 defines 2 new sub-TLV types for inclusion within the LSP
   Ping [RFC4379] Target FEC Stack TLV.

   IANA is requested to assign sub-type values to the following sub-TLVs
   from the "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) Parameters - TLVs" registry, "TLVs and sub-
   TLVs" sub-registry.

   Value    Meaning                           Reference

   23       Static Pseudowire sub-TLV         this document (sect 2.4.2)


7.2.  New Reverse-path Target FEC Stack TLV

   Section 3.4.2 defines a new TLV type for inclusion in the LSP-Ping
   packet.

   IANA is requested to assign a type value to the TLV from the
   "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) Parameters - TLVs" registry, "TLVs and sub-TLVs" sub-
   registry.

   Value    Meaning                           Reference

   TBD-1    Reverse-path Target FEC           this document (sect 3.4)
            Stack TLV

   The sub-TLV space and assignments for this TLV will be the same as
   that for the Target FEC Stack TLV.  Sub-types for the Target FEC
   Stack TLV and the Reverse-path Target FEC Stack TLV MUST be kept the
   same.  Any new sub-type added to the Target FEC Stack TLV MUST apply
   to the Reverse-path Target FEC Stack TLV as well.

7.3.  New Pseudowire Associated Channel Type

   On-demand Connectivity Verification requires a unique Associated
   Channel Type.  IANA is requested to assign a PW ACh Type from the
   "Pseudowire Associated Channel Type Registry" as describe below:


     Value     Description      TLV Follows     Reference
