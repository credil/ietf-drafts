    <abstract>
  	<t> Internet Service Providers (operators) are facing problems where localized congestion
	prevents full utilization of the path between sender and receiver at today's
	"broadband" speeds. Operators desire to control this congestion, which often appears
	to be caused by a small number of users consuming a large amount of bandwidth.
	Building out more capacity along all of the path to handle this congestion can
	be expensive and may not result in improvements for all users so
	network operators have sought other ways to manage congestion.
	The current mechanisms all suffer from difficulty measuring the congestion (as
	distinguished from the total traffic). </t>

      <t> The ConEx Working Group is designing a mechanism to make congestion along any
	path visible at the Internet Layer. This document describes example cases where 
	this mechanism would be useful. </t>
    </abstract>
   </front>

    <!-- ====================================================================== -->

    <section title="Introduction"> 

      <t> The growth of "always on" broadband connections, coupled with the steady
	increase in access speeds, have caused unforeseen problems for
	network operators and users alike. Users are increasingly seeing congestion at peak times and 
	changes in usage patterns (with the growth of real-time streaming) simply serve
	to exacerbate this. Operators want all their users to see a good service but are
	unable to see where congestion problems originate. But congestion results from sharing network
	capacity with others, not merely from using it. In general, today's "DSL"
	and cable-internet users cannot "cause" congestion in the absence of
	competing traffic. (Wireless operators and cellular internet have different
	tradeoffs which we will not discuss here.) </t>

      <t>Despite its central role in network control and management, congestion is a remarkably hard conept to define. 
	  The discussions in <xref target="Bauer09"/> provide a good academic background. <xref target="RFC6077"/> defines it as "as a state 
	  or condition that occurs when network resources are overloaded, resulting in impairments for
   network users as objectively measured by the probability of loss and/or delay." An economist might define it as the condition where
   the utility of a given user decreases due to an increase in network load.
   Common to these definitions is the idea that an increase in load results
   in a reduction of service from the network.</t>
   
   <t>Congestion takes two distinct forms. The first results
   from the interaction of traffic from	one set of users with traffic from other users, causing in a reduction in service (a cost)
   for all of them.
   the second, often referred to as "self-congestion", occurs when an increase in traffic from a
   single user causes that user to suffer a worse service (for instance because their traffic is being
   "shaped" by their ISP, or because they have an excessively large buffer in their home router). ConEx 
   is principally interested in the first form of congestion since it involves informing those other users
   of the impact you expect to have on them.</t>

      <t> While building out more capacity to handle increased traffic is always
	good, the expense and lead-time can be prohibitive, especially for network
	operators that charge flat-rate feeds to subscribers and are thus unable
	to charge heavier users more for causing more congestion <xref target="BB-incentive"></xref>. 
	The operators also face the challenge that network traffic grows according to Moore's Law -- increasing 
	capacity may only be buying a few months grace before you are again facing increasing congestion, reducing
	utility and customers demanding a better service. For an operator
	facing congestion caused by other operators' networks, building out its
	own capacity is unlikely to solve the congestion problem. Operators are
	thus facing increased pressure to find effective solutions to dealing
	with the increasing bandwidth demands of all users. </t> 
      	
      <t> The growth of "scavenger" behaviour (e.g. <xref target="LEDBAT"></xref>) helps to reduce congestion,
	but can actually make the problem less tractable. These 
	users are trying to make good use of the capacity of the path while minimising their own costs. Thus, users of such
	services may show very heavy total traffic up until the moment congestion
	is detected (at the Transport Layer), but then will immediately back off. 
	Monitoring (at the Internet Layer) cannot detect this congestion avoidance
	if the congestion in question is in a different domain further along the
	path and hence such users may get tretated as congestion-causing users. </t>

      <t>The ConEx working group proposes that Internet Protocol (IP) packets will carry additional ConEx information. 
	The exact protocol details are not described in this document, but the ConEx information will be sufficient 
	to allow any node in the network to see how much congestion is attributable to a given traffic flow. See 
	<xref target="ConEx-Abstract-Mech"></xref> for further details.</t>

    <section title="Definitions" anchor="conex-uses-defs">

   <t> In this section we define a number of terms
   that are used throughout the document. The key definition is that of congestion, 
   which has a number of meanings depending on context. The definition we use in 
   this document is based on the definition in <xref target="RFC6077"/>. This list of definitions
   is supplementary to that in <xref target="ConEx-Abstract-Mech"></xref>.

	<list style="hanging">

	<t hangText="Congestion:"> Congestion occurs when any user's traffic
	suffers increased delay, loss or ECN marking as a result of one or more
	network resources being overloaded. </t>
	
	<t hangText="Flow:">a series of packets from a 
	single sender to a single receiver that are treated by that sender as belonging to 
	a single stream for the purposes of congestion control. NB in general this is not the same
	as the aggregate of all traffic between the sender and receiver.</t>
		
	<t hangText="Congestion-rate:">For any granularity of traffic (packet, flow, aggregate, etc.),
	the instantaneous rate of traffic discarded or marked due to congestion. Conceptually, the 
	instantaneous bit-rate of the traffic multiplied by the instantaneous congestion it is experiencing.  </t>
	
	<t hangText="Congestion-volume:"> For any granularity of traffic (packet, flow, aggregate, etc.), the

 	<t hangText="Upstream Congestion:">  the accumulated level of congestion experienced by
	a traffic flow thus far along its path. In other words, at any point the Upstream Congestion is 
	the accmulated level of congestion the traffic flow has experienced as it travels from the sender to that point.
	At the receiver this is equivalent to the end-to-end congestion level that (usually) is reported back to the sender.</t>
	
	<t hangText="Downstream Congestion:">the level of congestion a flow of traffic

    <section title="Congestion Management">

	<t>Since 1988 the Internet architecture has made congestion management the 
	responsibility of the end-systems. The network signals congestion to the receiver, 
	the receiver feeds this back to the sender and the sender is expected to try and 
	reduce the traffic it sends.</t>

	<t>Any network that is persistently highly congested is inefficient. However the 
	total absence of congestion is equally bad as it means there is spare capacity in 
	the network that hasn’t been used. The long-standing aim of congestion control has 
	been to find the point where these two things are in balance.</t>

	<t>Over recent years, some network operators have come to the view that end-system 
	congestion management is insufficient. Because of the heuristics used by TCP, a 
	relatively small number of end-machines can get a disproportionately high share of 
	network resources. They have sought to “correct” this perceived problem by using 
	middleboxes that try and reduce traffic that is causing congestion or by artificially 
	starving some traffic classes to create stronger congestion signals.</t>
	
     <section title="Existing Approaches">
	
	<t>The authors have chosen not to exhaustively list current approaches to congestion management. 
	Broadly these approaches can be divided into those that happen at Layer 3 of the OSI model and
	those that use information gathered from higher layers. In general these approaches
	attempt to find a "proxy" measure for congestion. Layer 3 approaches include:
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>Volume accounting &mdash; the overall volume of traffic a given user or network sends
		is measured. Users may be subject to an absolute volume cap (e.g. 10Gbytes per month) or 
		the "heaviest" users may be sanctioned in some manner.</t>
		<t>Rate measurement &mdash; the traffic rate per user or per network can be measured. The 
		absolute rate a given user sends at may be limited at peak hours or the average rate
		may be used as the basis for inter-network billing. </t>
	</list>
	Higher layer approaches include:
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>Bottleneck rate policing &mdash; bottleneck flow rate policers aim to share the available
		capacity at a given bottleneck between all concurrent users.</t>
		<t>DPI and application rate policing &mdash; deep packet inspection and other techniques can 
		be used to determine what application a given traffic flow is associated with. Operators may
		then use this information to rate-limit or otherwise sanction certain applications at peak hours.</t>
	</list>
	</t>

      <t>All of these current approaches suffer from some general limitations. First,
	they introduce performance uncertainty. Flat-rate pricing plans are popular
	because users appreciate the certainty of having their monthly bill amount
	remain the same for each billing period, allowing them to plan their costs
	accordingly. But while flat-rate pricing avoids billing uncertainty, it
	creates performance uncertainty: users cannot know whether the performance
	of their connection is being altered or degraded based on how the network
	operator manages congestion. </t>     <t>Second, none of the approaches is able to make use of what may be the most
	important factor in managing congestion: the amount that a given endpoint
	contributes to congestion on the network. This information simply is not
	available to network nodes, and neither volume nor rate nor application
	usage is an adequate proxy for congestion volume, because none of these
	metrics measures a user or network's actual contribution to congestion on
	the network. </t>     <t> Finally, none of these solutions accounts for inter-network congestion.
	Mechanisms may exist that allow an operator to identify and mitigate
	congestion in their own network, but the design of the Internet means that
	only the end-hosts have full visibility of congestion information along the
	whole path. ConEx allows this information to be visible to everyone on the
	path and thus allows operators to make better-informed decisions about
	controlling traffic. </t>

     </section>
    </section>

    <!-- ====================================================================== -->

    <section title="Exposing Congestion">

      <t> We argue that current traffic-control mechanisms seek to control the
	wrong quantity. What matters in the network is neither the volume of
	traffic nor the rate of traffic: it is the contribution to congestion over
	time&nbsp;&mdash; congestion means that your traffic impacts other users,
	and conversely that their traffic impacts you. So if there is no congestion
	there need not be any restriction on the amount a user can send;
	restrictions only need to apply when others are sending traffic such that
	there is congestion. </t>

      <t> For example, an application intending to transfer large amounts of data
	could use a congestion control mechanism like <xref target="LEDBAT"></xref>
	to reduce its transmission rate before any competing TCP flows do, by
	detecting an increase in end-to-end delay (as a measure of impending
	congestion). However such techniques rely on voluntary, altruistic action
	by end users and their application providers. Operators can neither enforce
	their use nor avoid penalizing them for congestion they avoid. </t>

      <t> The Internet was designed so that end-hosts detect and control congestion.
	We argue that congestion needs to be visible to network nodes as well, not
	just to the end hosts. More specifically, a network needs to be able to
	measure how much congestion any particular traffic expects to cause between
	the monitoring point in the network and the destination ("rest-of-path
	congestion"). This would be a new capability. Today a network can use
	Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168"></xref> to
	detect how much congestion the traffic has suffered between the source and
	a monitoring point, but not beyond. This new capability would enable an
	ISP to give incentives for the use of LEDBAT-like applications that seek to 
	minimise congestion in the network whilst restricting inappropriate uses 
	of traditional TCP and UDP applications. </t>

      <t> So we propose a new approach which we call Congestion Exposure. We
	propose that congestion information should be made visible at the IP
	layer, so that any network node can measure the contribution to congestion
	of an aggregate of traffic as easily as straight volume can be measured
	today. Once the information is exposed in this way, it is then
	possible to use it to measure the true impact of any traffic on the
	network. </t>

      <t> In general, congestion exposure gives operators a principled way to hold their
	customers accountable for the impact on others of their network usage and
	reward them for choosing congestion-sensitive applications. </t>

     <section title="ECN - a Step in the Right Direction">

            <t> Explicit Congestion Notification <xref target="RFC3168"></xref> allows
		routers to explicitly tell end-hosts that they are approaching the point of
		congestion. ECN builds on Active Queue Mechanisms such as random early
		discard (RED) <xref target="RFC2309"></xref> by allowing the router to mark
		a packet with a Congestion Experienced (CE) codepoint, rather than dropping
		it. The probability of a packet being marked increases with the length of
		the queue and thus the rate of CE marks is a guide to the level of congestion
		at that queue. This CE codepoint travels forward through the network to the
		receiver which then informs the sender that it has seen congestion. The
		sender is then required to respond as if it had experienced a packet loss.
		Because the CE codepoint is visible in the IP layer, this approach reveals
		the upstream congestion level for a packet.</t> 
		<t> Alas, this is not enough - ECN gives downstream nodes an idea of the
		congestion so far for any flow. This can help hold a receiver accountable for
		the congestion caused by incoming traffic. But a receiver can only indirectly
		influence incoming congestion, by politely asking the sender to control it. A
		receiver cannot make a sender install an adaptive codec, or install LEDBAT
		instead of TCP congestion-control. And a receiver cannot cause an attacker to
		stop flooding it with traffic. </t>

 		<t> What is needed is knowledge of the downstream congestion level, for which
		you need additional information that is still concealed from the network. </t>

    <section title="ConEx Use Cases" anchor="conex-uses-cases">
 
	<t> This section sets out some of the use cases for ConEx. These use cases rely on some
	of the conceptual elements described in <xref target="ConEx-Abstract-Mech"></xref>.
      The authors don't claim this is an
	exhaustive list of use cases, nor that these have equal merit. In most cases ConEx is not the only
	solution to achieve these. But these use cases represent a consensus among
	people that have been working on this approach for some years.
      </t>

     <section title="ConEx as a basis for traffic management" anchor="conex-uses-traff-man">

	  <t> Currently many operators impose some form of traffic management at peak hours. This
	  is a simple economic necessity&nbsp;&mdash; the only reason the Internet works
	  as a commercial concern is that operators are able to rely on statistical multiplexing
	  to share their expensive core network between large numbers of customers. In order
	  to ensure all customers get some chance to access the network, the "heaviest"
	  customers will be subjected to some form of traffic management at peak times
	  (typically a rate cap for certain types of traffic) <xref target="Fair-use"></xref>. Often this traffic
	  management is done with expensive flow aware devices such as DPI boxes or flow-aware
	  routers. </t>
	  
	<t> ConEx offers a better approach that will actually target the users that are causing the congestion.
	By using Ingress or Egress Policers, an ISP can identify which users are causing the greatest Congestion
	Volume throughout the network. This can then be used as the basis for traffic management decisions. The
	Ingress Policer described in <xref target="Policing-freedom"></xref> is one interesting approach
	that gives the user a congestion volume limit. So long as they stay within their limit then their
	traffic is unaffected. Once they exceed that limit then their traffic will be blocked temporarily.</t>

     </section>

     <section title="ConEx to incentivise scavenger transports"anchor="conex-uses-scavenge">

	  <t> Recent work proposes a new approach for QoS where traffic is provided with a less
	  than best effort or "scavenger" quality of service. The idea is that low priority
	  but high volume traffic such as OS updates, P2P file transfers and view-later TV
	  programs should be allowed to use any spare network capacity, but should rapidly
	  get out of the way if a higher priority or interactive application starts up.
	  One solution being actively explored is LEDBAT which proposes a new congestion
	  control algorithm that is less aggressive in seeking out bandwidth than TCP. </t>

	  <t> At present most operators assume a strong correlation between the volume of a flow
	  and the impact that flow causes in the network. This assumption has been eroded
	  by the growth of interactive streaming which behaves in an inelastic manner and hence
	  can cause high congestion at relatively low data volumes. Currently LEDBAT-like transports
	  get no incentive from the ISP since they still transfer large volumes of data and may
	  reach high transfer speeds if the network is uncongested. Consequently the only current
	  incentive for LEDBAT is that it can reduce self-congestion effects.</t>
	  
	  
	  <t> If the ISP has deployed a ConEx-aware Ingress Policer then they are able to
	  incentivise the use of LEDBAT because a user will be policed according to the
	  overall congestion volume their traffic generates, not the rate or data volume. If all background file
	  transfers are only generating a low level of congestion, then the sender has
	  more "congestion budget" to "spend" on their interactive applications. It can
	  be shown <xref target="Kelly"></xref> that this approach improves social welfare&nbsp;&mdash; in
	  other words if you limit the congestion that all users can generate then
 	  everyone benefits from a better service. </t>

      <section title="Accounting for Congestion Volume" anchor="conex-congest-account">
	<t>
		Accountability was one of the original design goals for the Internet <xref target="Design-Philosophy"></xref>. At
		the time it was ranked low because the network was non-commercial and it was assumed
		users had the best interests of the network at heart. Nowadays users generally treat the 
		network as a commodity and the Internet has become highly commercialised. This 
		causes problems for operators and others	which they have tried to solve and often leads to a 
		tragedy of the commons where users end up fighting each other for scarce peak capacity.</t>
		
		<t>The most elegant
		solution would be to introduce an Internet-wide system of accountability where every actor in 
		the network is held to account for the impact they have on others. If  
		Policers are placed at every Network Ingress or Egress and Border Monitors at 
		every border, then you have the basis for a system of congestion accounting. Simply by
		controlling the overall Congestion Volume each end-system or stub-network can send you
		ensure everyone gets a better service.</t>
 		
      </section>
 	  
      <section title="ConEx as a form of differential QoS" anchor="conex-uses-qos">

	  <t> Most QoS approaches require the active participation of routers to control the
	  delay and loss characteristics for the traffic. For real-time interactive traffic
	  it is clear that low delay (and predictable jitter) are critical, and thus these probably
	  always need different treatment at a router. However if low loss is the issue
	  then ConEx offers an alternative approach.</t>
	  
	  <t>Assuming the ingress ISP has deployed a ConEx Ingress Policer, then the only control 
	  on a user's traffic is dependent on the congestion that user has caused. Likewise, if 
	  they are receiving traffic through a ConEx Egress Policer then their ISP will impose 
	  traffic controls (prioritisation, rate limiting, etc) based on the congestion they have caused.
	  If an end-user (be they the receiver or sender) wants to prioritise some
	  traffic over other traffic then they can allow that traffic to generate or cause more
	  congestion. The price they will pay will be to reduce the congestion that their other
	  traffic causes. </t>
	  
	  <t> Streaming video content-delivery is a good candidate for such ConEx-mediated QoS. Such traffic
		can tolerate moderately high delays, but there are strong economic pressures to maintain
		a high enough data rate (as that will directly influence the Quality of Experience the 
		end-user receives. This approach removes the need for bandwidth brokers to establish QoS 
		sessions, by removing the need to coordinate requests from multiple sources to pre-allocate 
		bandwidth, as well as to coordinate which allocations to revoke when bandwidth predictions 
		turn out to be wrong. There is also no need to "rate-police" at the boundaries on a per-flow basis, 
		removing the need to keep per-flow state (which in turn makes this approach more scalable).</t>

      </section>

  
      <section title="Partial vs. Full Deployment" anchor="conex-uses-deployment">
		
	<t>In a fully-deployed ConEx-enabled internet, <xref target="QoS-Models"></xref> shows that ISP settlements based on congestion 
	volume can allocate money to where upgrades are needed. Fully-deployed implies that ConEx-marked 
	packets which have not exhausted their expected congestion would go through a congested path 
	in preference to non-ConEx packets, with money changing hands to justify that priority. </t>
	
	<t>In a partial deployment, routers that ignore ConEx markings and let them pass unaltered are no problem unless 
	they become congested and drop packets. Since ConEx incentivises the use of lower congestion
	transports, such congestion drops should anyway become rare events. ConEx-unaware routers that do 
	drop ConEx-marked packets would cause a problem so to minimise this risk ConEx should be designed such that ConEx packets will appear 
	valid to any node they traverse. Failing that it could be possible to bypass such nodes with a tunnel. </t>
	
	<t>If any network is not ConEx enabled then the sender and receiver have to rely on ECN-marking or packet drops to
	establish the congestion level. If the receiver isn't ConEx-enabled then there needs to be some
	form of compatibility mode. Even in such partial deployments the end-users and access networks will
	benefit from ConEx. This will put create incentives for ConEx to be more widely adopted as
	access networks put pressure on their backhaul providers to use congestion as the basis of their
	interconnect agreement. </t>
	
	<t>The actual charge per unit of congestion would be specified in an interconnection agreement,
	with economic pressure driving that charge downward to the cost to upgrade whenever alternative
	paths are available. That charge would most likely be invisible to the majority of users. Instead
	such users will have a contractual allowance to cause congestion, and would see packets dropped 
	when that allowance is depleted. </t>
	
	<t>  Once an Autonomous System (AS) agrees to pay any congestion charges to any other AS it forwards to, 
	it has an economic incentive to increase congestion-so-far marking for any congestion within its 
	network. Failure to do this quickly becomes a significant cost, giving it an incentive to turn on such marking. </t>

	<t> End users (or the writers of the applications they use) will be given an incentive to use a congestion control
	that back off more aggressively than TCP for any elastic traffic. Indeed they will actually have an 
	incentive to use fully weighted congestion controls that allow traffic to cause congestion in proportion
	to its priority. Traffic which backs off more aggressively than TCP will see congestion charges remain 
	the same (or even drop) as congestion increases; traffic which backs off less aggressively will see charges 
	rise, but the user may be prepared to accept this if it is high-priority traffic; traffic which backs 
	off not at all will see charges rise dramatically. </t>

	<section title="Statistical Multiplexing over Differing Timescales" anchor="conex-uses-timescales">
	<t>Access networks are usually provisioned assuming statistical multiplexing, where end-users are presumed not 
	all to use their maximum bandwidth simultaneously. Typically, an ISP might design access networks with shared 
	resources (e.g., circuits, ports, schedulers) dimensioned in proportion to the sum of average usage by the 
	customers involved.  Generally, ISPs monitor actual usage averaged over some time period (typically stated in minutes) 
	to plan when upgrades to shared resources will be needed.</t>

	<t>Almost always, they find that certain busy periods of the day have higher usage; and that actual contention for bandwidth 
	at a shared resource (e.g., circuit, port, scheduler) is limited to those periods. This leads to "economic congestion" as 
	defined in Section 3.4 of <xref target="Bauer09"/>, where traffic by one end-user imposes a "cost" of reduced utility on other users. 
	Sometimes, there is an extended period between economic congestion being first observed and the completion of upgrades. 
	In other cases, a trend of "economic congestion" is used by a service provider before congestion as defined in the abstract 
	mechanism (loss or ECN marking) occurs.</t>

	<t>During busy periods, it has been observed that roughly 20% of the end-users are using 80% of the bandwidth <xref target="Varian"/>. We call 
	this roughly-20% "heavy users", and the others "light users". Left to itself, this situation means that heavy users cause queues 
	to fill at a rate much greater than light users do. (Note that this heavy/light categorization is for illustrative purposes since 
	there is actually a continuum of "heaviness" across users.) When both heavy and light users pay the same flat rate, ISPs believe 
	heavy users should bear more of the "cost" of reduced utility. </t>

	<t>When all users have unlimited access to a shared resource bottleneck, this problem is the most severe since maximum per user 
	bandwidth is that of the shared resource.  In order to provide more control over the maximum rate at which individual users 
	may send, many ISPs have deployed "traffic shapers" to limit bandwidth available to an individual user during all time periods. 
	Note that this limits the per user maximum bandwidth in the sub-second timeframe of the shaper queue. Currently, these "shapers" 
	make no distinction between busy periods where shared resource congestion may occur and periods when no congestion occurs.</t>

	<t>During a period of higher usage, a shared resource becomes the bottleneck and causes filling of a shared queue or individual 
	user shaper queues. However, heavy users create much more queuing and therefore potentially more congestion volume <xref target="conex-uses-defs"/>
	as compared with lighter users. This means that during periods of higher usage, heavier and lighter 
	users see comparable congestion (i.e., packet loss or ECN marking). Thus, the overall utility (i.e., probability of a packet 
	not being lost or ECN marked) is reduced by the fewer heavier users at the expense of the many lighter users.</t>

	<t>During periods of lighter usage, heavier users will fill their individual shaper queues, potentially creating loss or ECN 
	marking, such that TCP congestion-control does what the ISP desires and cuts back the sending rate giving the user the 
	expected maximum bandwidth.</t>
	
		<section title="ConEx Objectives for This Issue" anchor="conex-uses-timescale-objectives">
		<t>ConEx should provide better information for a provider to address the "economic congestion" problem. Specifically, ConEx 
		should help to distinguish which users cause queue-filling over a time interval matching the economic congestion and statistical 
		multiplexing algorithm time scales. This can range from seconds, to minutes, to hours. It is also desirable to distinguish 
		"self-congestion" where there is no contention for a shared resource bandwidth (e.g., circuit, port, scheduler), which is 
		referred to as "inter-user congestion" in the following. If this is visible to end-users, they could use an out-of-band 
		mechanism to "go faster" if only "self-congestion" is limiting their throughput.</t>

		<t>There are (at least) three approaches for addressing this issue.

			<list style="numbers">
			<t>Treat "self-congestion" the same as "inter-user congestion" since they both
			create congestion as perceived by the flow user; </t>

			<t>Signal more information to the receiver about the cause of loss since
			the remedy may differ;</t>

			<t>Process (and generate) ConEx information at the same network element which
			implements the shaper, which has knowledge of the configured maximum bandwidth for
			the users as well as local shared resource congestion.</t>
			</list>
		For the most part, these don't require any changes to the abstract mechanism; but a subcase of 2), 
		where the traffic-shaper might use ConEx to signal that the "congestion" is actually due to traffic-shaping, 
		not shared resource contention, could require additional signaling to be defined in the ConEx protocol.</t>

		<t>Note that during busy periods "self congestion" might not be the limiting factor, but there will inevitably 
		be less-busy periods where "self-congestion" will predominate.</t>

		<section title="Additional Support Using other Measures and Mechanisms" anchor="conex-uses-timescales-other">

			<t>An additional congestion measure of burstiness (in addition to "congestion") would allow nodes upstream from

			the abstract mechanism but would require (a majority) of the heavier senders and receivers to implement conex and 
			also would only work if loss or ECN marking occurs. Also, signaling a measure of the burstiness (or something 
			related to it) would partially address the scenario where no loss or ECN marking occurs.</t>

			<t>As an alternative, a "light weight" TCP proxy might be implemented at the network element containing the shaper, 
			and an upstream network element (e.g., an ingress router), could potentially create a ConEx control loop between 
			these network elements to provide more optimal balance between heavier and lighter users during congested intervals. 
			This would be a closed domain where the signals could be implicitly trusted. The burstiness measure could be communicated 
			using TCP extensions between these proxies.</t>

			<t>There is also the aspect of "self congestion" where a traffic-shaper is at the access node. Using the current mechanisms, 
			the receiver cannot tell the difference between "self-congestion" and "inter-user congestion." Adding a signal to the 
			abstract mechanism could enable a receiver to inform the sender about the cause of congestion, enabling the sender to 
			request that the traffic-shaper parameters change to enable the flow to "go faster".</t>

      <section title="Congestion as a Commercial Secret" anchor="conex-uses-secret">
	
	<t>
	Network operators have long viewed the congestion levels in their 
	network as a business secret. In some ways this harks back to the days 
	of fixed-line telecommunications where congestion manifested as failed 
	connections or dropped calls. But even in modern data-centric packet 
	networks congestion is viewed as a secret not to be shared with 
	competitors. It can be debated whether this view is sensible, but it
	may make operators uneasy about deploying ConEx. The following two 
	examples highlight some of the arguments used:
	<list style="symbols">
	<t>An ISP buys backhaul capacity from an operator. Most operators want their
	customers to get a decent service and so they want the backhaul to be
	relatively uncongested. If there is competition, operators will seek
	to reassure their customers (the operators) that their network is not congested in
	order to attract their custom. Some operators may
	see ConEx as a threat since it will enable those operators to see the actual congestion
	in their network. On the other hand, operators with low congestion
	could use ConEx to show how well their network performs, and so might have
	an incentive to enable it.</t>
	<t>ISPs would like to be part of the lucrative content provision market. Currently 
	the ISP can gain a competitive edge as it can put its own content in a higher QoS class, 
	whereas traffic from content providers has to use the
	Best Effort class. The ISP may take the view that if they can conceal the congestion
	level in their Best Effort class this will make it harder for the content provider
	to maintain a good level of QoS. But in reality the Content Provider will just
	use the feedback mechanisms in streaming protocols such as Adobe Flash to monitor the
	congestion.</t>
	</list>
	Of course some might say that the idea of keeping congestion secret is silly. After
	all, end-hosts already have knowledge of the congestion throughout the network, albeit only
	along specific paths, and operators can work out that there is persistent congestion as their
	customers will be suffering degraded network performance.

     <section title="Security Considerations">

        <t> This document proposes a mechanism tagging onto Explicit Congestion Notification
        <xref target="RFC3168"/>, and inherits the security issues listed therein. The
        additional issues from ConEx markings relate to the degree of trust
        each forwarding point places in the ConEx markings it receives, which is
        a business decision mostly orthogonal to the markings themselves. </t> 

      <t> One expected use of exposed congestion information is to hold the end-to-end
	transport and the network accountable to each other. The network cannot be relied
	on to report information to the receiver against its interest, and the same applies
	for the information the receiver feeds back to the sender, and that the sender
	reports back to the network. Looking at each in turn:
 	<list style="hanging"> 	
	<t hangText="The Network"> In general it is not in any network's interest to under-declare
	  congestion since this will have potentially negative consequences for all users
	  of that network. It may be in its interest to over-declare congestion if, for
	  instance, it wishes to force traffic to move away to a different network or
	  simply to reduce the amount of traffic it is carrying. Congestion Exposure
	  itself won't significantly alter the incentives for and against honest
	  declaration of congestion by a network, but we can imagine applications of
	  Congestion Exposure that will change these incentives. There is a perception
	  among network operators that their level of congestion is a business secret.
	  Today, congestion is one of the worst-kept secrets a network has, because
	  end-hosts can see congestion better than network operators can. Congestion
	  Exposure will enable network operators to pinpoint whether congestion is on
	  one side or the other of any border. It is conceivable that forwarders with
	  underprovisioned networks may try to obstruct deployment of Congestion
	  Exposure. </t>
	
	  <t hangText="The Receiver"> Receivers generally have an incentive to under-declare
	  congestion since they generally wish to receive the data from the sender as
	  rapidly as possible. <xref target="Savage"></xref> explains how a receiver can
	  significantly improve their throughput my failing to declare congestion. This
	  is a problem with or without Congestion Exposure. <xref target="KGao"></xref>
	  explains one possible technique to encourage receiver's to be honest in their
	  declaration of congestion.</t>
	
	  <t hangText="The Sender"> One proposed mechanism for Congestion Exposure deployment adds
	  a requirement for a sender to advise the network how much congestion it has
	  suffered or caused. Although most senders currently respond to congestion
	  they are informed of, one use of exposed congestion information might be to
	  encourage sources of persistent congestion to back off more aggressively.
	  Then clearly there may be an incentive for the sender to under-declare
	  congestion. This will be a particular problem with sources of flooding
	  attacks. "Policing" mechanisms have been proposed to deal with this. </t>
 	</list>
 	In addition there are potential problems from source spoofing. A malicious
	sender can pretend to be another user by spoofing the source address.
	Congestion Exposure allows for "Policers" and "Traffic Shapers" so as to be
	robust against injection of false congestion information into the forward
	path. </t>

- <abstract>
  <t>This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders inform the network about the congestion 
  encountered by packets earlier in the same flow. Today, the network may signal congestion to the receiver
  by ECN markings or by dropping packets, and the receiver may pass this information back to the sender in 
  transport-layer feedback. The mechanism to be developed by the ConEx WG will enable the sender to also 
  relay this congestion information back into the network in- band at the IP layer, such that the total level 
  of congestion is visible to all IP devices along the path, from where it could, for example, be provided as 
  input to traffic management.</t>
