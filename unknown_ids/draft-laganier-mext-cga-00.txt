Authorizing Mobile IPv6 Binding Update with Cryptographically Generated
                               Addresses

Abstract

   The standard RFC 3775 mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates
   sent by a Mobile Node to its Home Agent relies on the use of a pair
   of unidirectional IPsec security associations between these two
   nodes.  The standard mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates
   sent by a Mobile Node to one of its Correspondent Nodes relies on the
   use of a return routability test that involves the Correspondent Node
   verifying reachability of the Mobile Node at both its Home Address
   and its Care-of Address.  The mechanism also requires the
   correspondent node to send keying material to both of these
   addresses.

   RFC 4866 specifies a standard track mecanism that allows a Mobile
   Node that has configured a Cryptographically Generated Address (RFC
   3972) as its Home Address to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates sent
   its Correspondent Nodes based on the properties of its
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses.  Note that Cryptographically
   Generated Addresses have also been used to counter similar security
   issues in the context of SHIM6 (RFC 5533) and Secure Neighbor
   Discovery (RFC 3971.)

   This memo proposes a mechanism that would let a Mobile Node use a
   similar mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates its sent to
   its Home Agent with a similar technique based on the use of
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses.

1.  Introduction

   The standard RFC 3775 [RFC3775] mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6
   Binding Updates sent by a Mobile Node to its Home Agent relies on the
   use of a pair of unidirectional IPsec security associations between
   these two nodes [RFC4877].  The standard mechanism to secure Mobile
   IPv6 Binding Updates sent by a Mobile Node to one of its
   Correspondent Nodes relies on the use of a return routability test
   that involves the Correspondent Node verifying reachability of the
   Mobile Node at both its Home Address and its Care-of Address.  The
   mechanism also requires the correspondent node to send keying
   material to both of these addresses.

   RFC 4866 [RFC4866] specifies a standard track mecanism that allows a
   Mobile Node that has configured a Cryptographically Generated Address
   [RFC3972] as its Home Address to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates
   sent its Correspondent Nodes based on the properties of its
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses.  Note that Cryptographically
   Generated Addresses have also been used to counter similar security
   issues in the context of SHIM6 [RFC5533] and Secure Neighbor
   Discovery [RFC3971].

   This memo proposes a mechanism that would let a Mobile Node use a
   similar mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates its sent to
   its Home Agent with a similar technique based on the use of
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses.

5.  Usage Scenario

   The mechanism described herein is useful in situations where there is
   a desire not to depend on IPsec for protection of the Mobile IPv6
   signaling between the Mobile Node and the Home Agent.

6.  Mobile Node Operation

   A Mobile Node creates and updates a Binding with its Home Agent by
   sending a Binding Update to its Home Agent.  The Binding Update MUST
   include:

   o  a monotically increasing Sequence Number as per [RFC3775].

   o  a CGA Parameters option for the Cryptographically Generated Home
      Address of the Mobile Node as per [RFC4866].

   o  a Timestamp option as per [RFC5213].

   o  an Alternate Care-of Address option as per [RFC3775].

   o  a Signature option as per [RFC4866].

7.  Home Agent Operation

   A Home Agent MUST accept a Binding Update from a Mobile Node and
   maintain accordingly the corresponding Binding Cache Entry if the
   Binding Update includes all of the following:

   o  a valid Sequence Number [RFC3775].  That is, if there is no
      existing Binding Cache Entry and the Timestamp is valid, the
      Sequence Number is accepted and recorded in the Binding Cache
      Entry.  If there exists a Binding Cache Entry, the Sequence Number
      MUST be greater than the value recorded in the Binding Cache
      Entry.

   o  a CGA Parameters option for the Cryptographically Generated Home
      Address of the Mobile Node as per [RFC4866].

   o  a valid Timestamp option [RFC5213].  That is, if there is no
      existing Binding Cache Entry, the time offset between the
      Timestamp and local Home Agent clock is recorded in the Binding
      Cache Entry.  If there exists a Binding Cache Entry, the Timestamp
      MUST not differ from the local Home Agent clock for more than 1.5
      times the time offset recorded in the Binding Cache Entry.

   o  an Alternate Care-of Address option as per [RFC3775].

   o  a valid Signature option as per [RFC4866].
