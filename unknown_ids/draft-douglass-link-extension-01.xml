      <t>
        This specification introduces new iCalendar
        property LINK to provide ancillary information for iCalendar
        components and changes RELATED-TO to define temporal relationships.
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The currently existing iCalendar standard <xref target='RFC5545'/> lacks
        a general purpose method for referencing additional, external information
        relating to calendar components.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document proposes a method for referencing typed external
        information that can provide additional information about an iCalendar
        component. This new LINK property is closely aligned to the LINK header 
        defined in 
        <xref target='RFC5988'/>
      </t>

      <t>
        In addition the RELTYPE parameter is extended to take new values 
        defining temporal relationships, a GAP parameter is defined to provide
        lead and lag values and RELATED-TO is extended to allow URI values.
        These changes allows the RELATED-TO property to define a richer set of
        relationships useful for project management.
      </t>

    <section anchor="typed_references"
             title="Typed References">
      <t>
        The LINK property defines a typed reference or relation to external 
        meta-data or related resources. By providing type and format information  
        as parameters, clients and servers are able to discover interesting 
        references and make use of them, perhaps for indexing or the 
        presentation of interesting links for the user. 
      </t>

      <t>
        It is often necessary to relate calendar components. The current
        RELATED-TO property only allows for a UID which is inadequate for many
        purposes. Allowing other types may help but might raise a number of 
        backward compatibility issues. The link property can link components 
        in different collections or even on different servers.
      </t>

      <t>
        When publishing events it is useful to be able to refer back to the 
        source of that information. The actual event may have been consumed from 
        a feed or an ics file on a web site. A LINK property can provide
        a reference to the originator of the event.
      </t>

      <t>
        Project management tools often need to be able to specify the relationships
        between the various events and tasks which make up a project. This 
        specification defines relation types for those purposes.
      </t>

          <t hangText="UID:">
            This allows for linking within a single collection and the value is
            assumed to be another component within that collection.

          <t hangText="REFERENCE:">
            An xpointer. In an XML environment it may be necessary to refer to
            an external XML artifact. The XPointer is defined in 
            <xref target='W3C.WD-xptr-xpointer-20021219'/> and allows
            addressing portions of XML documents.

    <section anchor="link_relation_types"

      <t>
        <xref target='RFC5988'/> defines two form of relation types, registered
        and extension. Registered relation types are added to a registry defined 
        by <xref target='RFC5988'/> while extension relation types are specified 
        as unique unregistered URIs, (at least unregistered in the 
        <xref target='RFC5988'/> registry). 
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The relation types defined here will be registered with IANA in 
        accordance with the specifications in  <xref target='RFC5988'/>.

        Relationship parameter type values are defined in section 3.2.15. of 
        <xref target='RFC5545'/>. This specification redefines that type to 
        include the new values FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, 
        STARTTOFINISH and STARTTOSTART.

            hierarchical relationship type of the calendar component
            referenced by the property when the value is PARENT, CHILD or SIBLING.
            It defines the temporal relationship when the value is one of 
            FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH or STARTTOSTART. 
            If this parameter is not specified on an
            allowable property, the default relationship type is PARENT.
            Applications MUST treat x-name and iana-token values they don't
            recognize the same way as they would the PARENT value.

            <t hangText="Purpose:">
              This property is used to represent a relationship or
              reference between one calendar component and another. The definition
              here extends the definition in Section 3.8.4.5. of 
              <xref target='RFC5545'/> by allowing URI values adn a GAP parameter.
            </t>
  
            <t hangText="Value type:">
              URI or TEXT
            </t>
  
            <t hangText="Property Parameters:">
              Non-standard, reference type, gap, value or format type parameters can be
              specified on this property.
            </t>
  
            <t hangText="Conformance:">
              This property MAY be specified in any iCalendar component.
            </t>
  
            <t hangText="Description:">
              By default or when VALUE=UID is specified, the property value 
              consists of the persistent, globally
              unique identifier of another calendar component.  This value would
              be represented in a calendar component by the "UID" property.
            </t>

            <t>
              By default, the property value points to another calendar
              component that has a PARENT relationship to the referencing
              object.  The "RELTYPE" property parameter is used to either
              explicitly state the default PARENT relationship type to the
              referenced calendar component or to override the default PARENT
              relationship type and specify either a CHILD or SIBLING
              relationship or a temporal relationship.  
            </t>

            <t>
              The PARENT relationship indicates that the calendar
              component is a subordinate of the referenced calendar component.
              The CHILD relationship indicates that the calendar component is a
              superior of the referenced calendar component.  The SIBLING
              relationship indicates that the calendar component is a peer of
              the referenced calendar component.
            </t>

            <t>
              The FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH or STARTTOSTART
              relationships define temporal relationships as specified in the 
              reltype parameter definition.
            </t>

            <t>
              Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property can
              have an implicit impact on the related calendar component.  For
              example, if a group event changes its start or end date or time,
              then the related, dependent events will need to have their start
              and end dates changed in a corresponding way.  Similarly, if a
              PARENT calendar component is cancelled or deleted, then there is
              an implied impact to the related CHILD calendar components.  This
              property is intended only to provide information on the
              relationship of calendar components.  It is up to the target
              calendar system to maintain any property implications of this
              relationship.

          This section defines the process to register new or modified
          reference types with IANA.

        <section anchor="reftype_registration_procedure"
                 title="Reference Type Registration Procedure">
          <t>
            The IETF will create a mailing list,
            <eref target="mailto:icalreference@ietf.org">icalreference@ietf.org</eref>,
            which can be used for public discussion of reference type
            proposals prior to registration. Use of the mailing list
            is strongly encouraged. The IESG will appoint a designated
            expert who will monitor the
            <eref target="mailto:icalreference@ietf.org">icalreference@ietf.org</eref>
            mailing list and review registrations.
          </t>

          <t>
            Registration of new reference types MUST be reviewed by
            the designated expert and published in an RFC. A Standard
            Tracks RFC is REQUIRED for the registration of reference types.
            A Standard Tracks RFC is also REQUIRED for changes to reference types 
            previously documented in a Standard Tracks RFC.
          </t>

          <t>
            The registration procedure begins when a completed registration
            template, defined in the sections below, is sent to
            <eref target="mailto:icalreference@ietf.org">icalreference@ietf.org</eref>
            and
            <eref target="mailto:iana@iana.org">iana@iana.org</eref>.
            The designated expert is expected to tell IANA and the submitter
            of the registration within two weeks whether the registration
            is approved, approved with minor changes, or rejected with
            cause.  When a registration is rejected with cause, it can be
            re-submitted if the concerns listed in the cause are addressed.
            Decisions made by the designated expert can be appealed to the
            IESG Applications Area Director, then to the IESG. They follow
            the normal appeals procedure for IESG decisions.
