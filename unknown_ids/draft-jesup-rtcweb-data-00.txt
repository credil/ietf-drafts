Abstract

   This document investigates the possibilities for designing a generic
   transport service that allows Web Browser to exchange generic data in
   a peer to peer way.  Different transport protocols and their
   properties are investigated in order to identify the most appropriate
   one.

Internet-Draft             data P2P in RTCWEB               October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The issue of how best to handle non-media data types in the context
   of RTCWEB is still under discussion in the mailing list; there have
   been several proposal on how to address this problem, but there is
   not yet a clear consensus on the actual solution.

   However it seems to be a general agreement that for NAT traversal
   purpose it has to be:

   FOO/UDP/IP

   or most likely:

   FOO/DTLS/UDP/IP (for confidentiality, source authenticated, integrity
   protected transfers)

   where FOO is a protocol that is supposed to provide congestion
   control and possible some type of framing or stream concept.

   Moreover there has been a clear interest for both an unreliable and a
   reliable peer to peer datagram based channel.

   This document provides Requirement and use cases for both unreliable
   and reliable peer to peer datagram base channel, provide an overview
   of the pro and cons of the different proposed solutions, and finally
   analyze in more detail the SCTP based solution.


2.  Requirements

   This section lists the requirements for P2P data connections between
   two browsers.

   Req. 1  Multiple simultaneous datagram streams must be supported.
      Note that there may 0 or more media streams in parallel with the
      data streams, and the number and state (active/inactive) of the
      media streams may change at any time.

   Req. 2  Both reliable and unreliable datagram streams must be
      supported.

   Req. 3  Data streams must be congestion controlled; either
      individually, as a class, or in conjunction with the media
      streams, to ensure that datagram exchanges don't cause congestion
      problems for the media streams, and that the rtcweb PeerConnection
      as a whole is fair with competing streams such as TCP.

Internet-Draft             data P2P in RTCWEB               October 2011



   Req. 4  The application should be able to provide guidance as to the
      relative priority of each datagram stream relative to each other,
      and relative to the media streams. [ TBD: how this is encoded and
      what the impact of this is. ] This will interact with the
      congestion control.

   Req. 5  Datagram streams must be encrypted; allowing for
      confidentiality, integrity and source authentication.  See the
      security spec [xxx] for detailed info.

   Req. 6  Consent and NAT traversal mechanism: These are handled by the
      PeerConnection's ICE [RFC5245] connectivity checks and optional
      TURN servers.



3.  Use cases.

3.1.  Use cases for unreliable datagram based channel

   U-C 1  A real-time game where position and object state information
      is sent via one or more unreliable data channels.  Note that at
      any time there may be no media channels, or all media channels may
      be inactive.

   U-C 2  Non-critical state updates about a user in a video chat or
      conference, such as Mute state.


3.2.  Use cases for reliable channels (datagram or stream).

   Note that either reliable datagrams or streams are possible; reliable
   streams would be fairly simple to layer on top of SCTP reliable
   datagrams with in-order delivery.

   U-C 3  A real-time game where critical state information needs to be
      transferred, such as control information.  Typically this would be
      datagrams.

   U-C 4  Non-realtime file transfers between people chatting.  This
      could be datagrams or streaming; streaming might be an easier fit

   U-C 5  Realtime text chat while talking with multiple people in a
      conference.  Typically this would be datagrams.

   U-C 6  Renegotiation of the set of media streams in the
      PeerConnection.  Typically this would be datagrams



4.  Protocol alternatives

4.1.  Datagrams over DTLS over DCCP over UDP.

   DCCP [RFC4340] adds to a UDP-like foundation the minimum mechanisms
   necessary to support congestion control.  It is a unicast,
   connection-oriented protocol with bidirectional data flow.

   The main downside of DCCP is the uncertainty of the DCCP
   implementations.  Moreover DCCP only meets the requirements for the
   unreliable data channel, so in order to satisfy the reliable data
   channel requirements there is a need to build a new mechanism on top
   of DCCP or use a different protocol for it.

   The main advantage of DCCP is that the Congestion Control (CC)
   methods are modularly separated from its core, that allows each
   application to choose a method it prefers.

4.2.  Datagrams over SCTP over DTLS over UDP.

                          Figure 2: stack diagram

   An SCTP [RFC4960] based solution will provide several interesting
   features among the others: Multistreaming, Ordered and Unordered
   delivery, Reliability and partial-Reliability [RFC3758], and Dynamic
   Address Reconfiguration [RFC5061].  The SCTP feature so seems to
   satisfy all the requirements for both the unreliable and the reliable
   scenario.

   TBD: any downside for SCTP???

   There are SCTP implementations for all the different OS: Linux
   (mainline kernel 2.6.36), FreeBSD (release kernel 8.2), Mac OS X,
   Windows (SctpDrv4) and Solaris (OpenSolaris 2009.06), as well as a
   user-land SCTP implementation based on the FreeBSD implementation).

   The SCTP solution is analyzed in more detail in Section 5.

4.3.  A new protocol on top of UDP.

   This option requires to at least build a congestion control (CC)
   mechanism on top of the plain UDP.

   In designing it we have to follow carefully the guidelines provided
   in [RFC5405].

   TBD: describe here the proposal to implement in the userspace TCP/
   DTLS/UDP for reliable data channels, and UDP-with-TFRC/DTLS/UDP for
   unreliable data channels (e.g. libjingle).

4.4.  A RTP compatible protocol.

   TBD


5.  Datagrams over SCTP over DTLS over UDP.

5.1.  User Space vs Kernel implementation.

   Even kernel implementation of SCTP are already available for all the
   different platforms (see Section 4.2 ), there are compelling reasons
   that incline towards for a SCTP stack that works well in user land.

   The main reason is deployability.

   TBD..

5.2.  The envisioned usage of SCTP in the RTCWeb context

   The appealing features of SCTP in the RTCWeb context are:

   -  the congestion control which is TCP friendly.
   -  the congestion control is modifiable for integration with media
      stream congestion control.
   -  support for multiple channels with different characteristics.
   -  support for out-of-order delivery.
   -  support for large datagrams and PMTU-discovery and fragmentation.

Internet-Draft             data P2P in RTCWEB               October 2011


   -  the reliable or partial reliability support.

   Multi streaming is probably also of interest.

   Multihoming will not be used in this scenario.  The SCTP layer would
   simply act as if it were running on a single-homed host, since that
   is the abstraction that the lower layers (e.g.  UDP) would expose.

5.3.  SCTP/DTLS/UDP vs DTLS/SCTP/UDP

   The two alternatives being discussed in this subsection are shown in
   the following Figure 4.

                       | DTLS |                    | SCTP |
                +-------------+             +-------------+
                | STUN | SCTP |             | STUN | DTLS |
                +-------------+             +-------------+

                +-------------+             +-------------+

               Figure 4: Two variants of SCTP and DTLS usage

   The UDP encapsulation of SCTP used in the protocol stack shown on the
   left hand side of Figure 4 is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-udp-encaps] and the usage of DTLS over SCTP is
   specified in [RFC6083].  Using the UDP encapsulation of SCTP allows
   SCTP implementations to run in user-land without any special
   privileges, but still allows the support of SCTP kernel
   implementations.  This also requires no SCTP specific support in
   middleboxes like firewalls and NATs.  However, if multihoming is
   required, SCTP needs to setup the associations iteratively, which
   requires support at the SCTP implementations.  If WEBAPP does not use
   multihoming, the support of the iterative association setup procedure
   is not required.  The SCTP payload is protected by DTLS, which
   provides confidentiality, integrity and source authentication.  SCTP-
   AUTH as specified in [RFC4895] is used to provide integrity of SCTP
   control information related to the user messages like the SCTP stream
   identifier.  Please note that the SCTP control information (like the
   SCTP stream identifier) is sent unencrypted.

   Considering the protocol stack on the right hand side of Figure 4,
   the usage of DTLS over UDP is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4347-bis].  Using SCTP on top of DTLS is currently
   unspecified.  Since DTLS is typically implemented in user-land, an
   SCTP user-land implementation has also to be used.  Kernel SCTP

   implementations can't be used.  When using DTLS as the lower layer,
   only single homed SCTP associations can be used, since DTLS does not
   expose any any address management to its upper layer.  DTLS
   implementations used for this stack must support controlling fields
   of the IP layer like the DF-bit in case of IPv4 and the DSCP field.
   This is required for performing path MTU discovery.  The DTLS
   implementation must also support sending user messages exceeding the
   path MTU.  When supporting multiple SCTP associations over a single
   DTLS connection, incoming ICMP or ICMPv6 messages can't be processed
   by the SCTP layer, since there is no way to identify the
   corresponding association.  Therefore the number of SCTP associations
   should be limited to one or ICMP and ICMPv6 messages should be
   ignored.  In general, the lower layer interface of an SCTP
   implementation has to be adopted to address the differences between
   IPv4 or IPv6 (being connection-less) or DTLS (being connection-
   oriented).  When this stack is used, DTLS protects the complete SCTP
   packet, so it provides confidentiality, integrity and source
   authentication of the complete SCTP packet.

   It should be noted that both stack alternatives support the usage of
   multiple SCTP streams.  A user message can be sent ordered or
   unordered and, if the SCTP implementations support [RFC3758], with
   partial reliability.  When using partial reliability, it might make
   sense to use a policy limiting the number of retransmissions.
   Limiting the number of retransmissions to zero provides a UDP like
   service where each user messages is sent exactly once.

   SCTP provides congestion control on a per-association base.  This
   means that all SCTP streams within a single SCTP association share
   the same congestion window.  Traffic not being sent over SCTP is not
   covered by the SCTP congestion control.


6.  Message Format.

   TBD if we need also to design a framing or not.

   At time of writing nobody has identified a real need for masking of
   UDP, and DTLS is a much-preferred solution for encryption/
   authentication.

   More SCTP already provides sequence number information (e.g. stream
   sequence numbers).  However there could be a need to support
   different kind of message (link in WebSocket where there is support
   to distinguish between Unicode text and binary frames), since for
   SCTP they are all user message.  In the case there is this need a
   possibility is to map types to streams.
