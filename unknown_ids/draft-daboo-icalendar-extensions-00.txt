Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions        February 2010


1.  Introduction

   The iCalendar [RFC5545] data format is used to represent calendar
   data and is used with iTIP [RFC5546] to handle scheduling operations
   between calendar users. iCalendar is in widespread use, and in
   accordance with provisions in that specification, extension elements
   have been added by various vendors to the data format in order to
   support and enhance capabilities.  This specification collates a
   number of these ad-hoc extensions and uses the new IANA registry
   capability defined in [RFC5545] to register standard variants with
   clearly defined definitions and semantics.  In addition, some new
   elements are introduced for features that vendors have been
   requesting recently.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of [RFC5234] as
   used by iCalendar [RFC5545].  Any syntax elements shown below that
   are not explicitly defined in this specification come from iCalendar
   [RFC5545].


3.  Modifications to Calendar Components

   The following changes to the syntax defined in iCalendar [RFC5545]
   are made here.  New elements are defined in subsequent sections.

      the calendar data and a location from where updates can be
      retrieved.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following

      object.

   Description:  This property specifies a color that client MAY use
      when presenting the calendar data to a user.  Typically this would
      appear as the "background" color of events or tasks.  The value
      MUST be an RGB value with integer value components in the range
      0..255

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

          calcolor       = "CALENDAR-COLOR" calcolorparam ":"

   Value Type:  The default value type for this property is URI.  The
      value type can also be set to BINARY to indicate inline binary
      encoded content information.  The value MUST refer to or be data
      with a media type of "image".

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, display, inline encoding,
      and value data type property parameters can be specified on this
      property.  The format type parameter can be specified on this
      property and is RECOMMENDED for inline binary encoded content
      information.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in an
      iCalendar object.

   Description:  This property specifies an image for an iCalendar
      object via a uri or directly with inline data that can be used by
      calendar user agents when presenting the calendar data to a user.
      Multiple properties MAY be used to specify alternative sets of
      images with, for example, varying media subtypes, resolutions or
      sizes.  When multiple properties are present, calendar user agents
      SHOULD display only one of them, picking one that provides the
      most appropriate image quality, or display none.  The "DISPLAY"
      parameter is used to indicate the intended display mode for the
      image.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

          calimg     = "CALENDAR-IMAGE" calimgparam ( ":" uri ) /
                       (
                         ";" "ENCODING" "=" "BASE64"
                         ";" "VALUE" "=" "BINARY"
                         ":" binary
                       )
                       CRLF

          calimgparam = *(
                         ;
                         ; The following is OPTIONAL for a URI value,
                         ; RECOMMENDED for a BINARY value,
                         ; and MUST NOT occur more than once.

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

          CALENDAR-IMAGE;DISPLAY=BADGE;FMTTYPE=image/png:http://ex
           ample.com/images/holiday.png


5.  Component Properties

5.1.  IMAGE Property

   Property Name:  IMAGE

   Purpose:  This property specifies an image associated with the
      calendar.

   Value Type:  The default value type for this property is URI.  The
      value type can also be set to BINARY to indicate inline binary
      encoded content information.  The value MUST refer to or be data
      with a media type of "image".

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, display, inline encoding,
      and value data type property parameters can be specified on this
      property.  The format type parameter can be specified on this
      property and is RECOMMENDED for inline binary encoded content
      information.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in a
      "VEVENT", "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar component.

   Description:  This property specifies an image for a calendar
      component via a uri or directly with inline data that can be used
      by calendar user agents when presenting the calendar data to a
      user.  Multiple properties MAY be used to specify alternative sets
      of images with, for example, varying media subtypes, resolutions
      or sizes.  When multiple properties are present, calendar user
      agents SHOULD display only one of them, picking one that provides
      the most appropriate image quality, or display none.  The
      "DISPLAY" parameter is used to indicate the intended display mode
      for the image.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

                        ;
                        )

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

          IMAGE;DISPLAY=BACKGROUND;FMTTYPE=image/png:htt
           p://example.com/images/party.png


6.  Property Parameters

6.1.  DISPLAY Property Parameter

   Parameter Name:  DISPLAY

   Purpose:  To specify different ways in which an image for a calendar
      or component can be displayed.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

      displayparam = "DISPLAY" "="
                     ("BADGE" /       ; A small "badge" image
                      "BACKGROUND" /  ; Use as a background image
                      "OVERLAY" /     ; Use as an overlay image
                      "BANNER" /      ; Use as a "banner" across the top
                      x-name /        ; Experimental type
                      iana-token)     ; Other IANA registered type
                                      ;
                                      ; Default is BADGE

   Description:  This property parameter MAY be specified on "CALENDAR-
      IMAGE" or "IMAGE" properties.  In the absence of this parameter,
      the value "BADGE" MUST be used for the default behavior.  The
      value determines how a client ought to present an image supplied
      in iCalendar data to the user.

      Servers and clients MUST treat x-name and iana-token values they
      don't recognize the same way as they would the "NONE" value.

   Example:

          IMAGE;DISPLAY=BANNER;FMTTYPE=image/png:htt
           p://example.com/images/weather-cloudy.png


7.  Security Considerations

   TODO:Perhaps discuss issues with image processing related buffer
   overflows, accessing external URLs (privacy), etc.


8.  IANA Considerations
