When implemented using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), it is referred to as Multiple Appearances (MA) since SIP does not have lines. This feature is commonly offered in the IP Centrex services and IP-PBX offerings and is likely to be implemented on SIP IP telephones and SIP feature servers used in a business environment.  This document lists requirements and compares implementation options for this feature.  Extensions to the SIP dialog event package are proposed.</t></abstract></front><middle><section title="Introduction"> <t>  The feature and functionality requirements for SIP user agents (UAs) supporting business telephony applications differ greatly from basic SIP user agents, both in terms of services and end user experience. In addition to basic SIP support, many of the services in a business environment require the support for SIP extensions such as REFER [3], SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY primitives [4], the SIP Replaces [5] and Join [9] header fields, etc. Many of the popular business services have been documented in the SIP Service Examples [6]. </t><t>This specification details a method for implementing a group telephony feature known in telephony as Bridged Line Appearance (BLA) or Multiple Line Appearances (MLA), one of the more popular advanced features expected of SIP IP telephony devices in a business environment. Other names for this feature include Shared Call/Line Appearance (SCA), Shared Call Status and Multiple Call Appearance (MCA).  A variant of this feature is known as Single Line Extension.</t><t>This document looks at how this feature can be implemented using standard SIP RFC 3261 [2] in conjunction with RFC 3265 [4] for exchanging status among user agents, and the SIP dialog state event package [7] to exchange dialog state information to achieve the same.  Different approaches will be discussed including the use of URI parameters, feature tags, and dialog package extensions along with the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches.</t><t>A call flow for Single Line Extension was formerly included in the SIP Service Examples [6].  However, the attempt to implement using standard SIP primitives ultimately failed, leading to its removal from that document. This document defines SIP extensions to implement this service.</t><t>In traditional telephony, the line is physical.  A common scenario is for a number of business telephones to share a single or a small number of lines. The appearance number relates to the user interface for the telephone - typically each appearance has a visual display (lamp that can change color or blink) and a button (used to select the appearance). In SIP terms, the line is virtual. However, the concept of appearance is still relevant to SIP due to the user interface considerations. It is important to keep the appearance number construct because:</t><t> <list style="numbers"><t>Human users are used to the concept and will expect it in replacement systems (e.g. an overhead page announcement says "Joe pickup line 3").</t><t>It is a useful structure for user interface representation.</t><t>There are cases where for bandwidth or gateway limitations, it is useful to limit the number of concurrent sessions.</t></list></t><t>In this document, we will use the term "appearance" as a stand-in for "line appearance" since SIP does not have lines. Note that this does not mean that a conventional telephony user interface (lamps and buttons) must be used - implementations may use another metaphor as long as the appearance number is readily apparent to the user.</t></section><section title="Conventions used in this document">   <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for compliant mechanisms.</t> </section><section title="Usage Scenarios"><t>The following examples are common applications of the Multiple Appearances feature and are mentioned here as informative use cases.   All these example usages can be supported by the Multiple Appearances feature described in this document.  The differences relate to the user interface considerations of the device.</t><section title="Executive/Assistant Arrangement"> <t>The appearances on the executive's UA may also appear on the assistant's UA.  The assistant may answer incoming calls to the executiveand then place the call on hold for the executive to pick up.  Theassistant can always see the state of all calls on the executive's UA.</t></section><section title="BLA Call Group"> <t>Users with similar business needs or tasks can be assigned to specific groups and share the line appearances of each other on each others SIP telephony devices.  For example, an IT department staff of five might answer a help line which has three appearances on each phone in the IT work area.  A call answered on one phone can be put on hold and picked up on another phone.  A shout or an IM to another staff member can result in them taking over a call on a particular appearance.  Another phone can request to be added to an appearance resulting in a conference call.</t></section><section title="Single Line Extension"><t>In this scenario, incoming calls are offered to a group of UAs.  When one answers, the other UAs are informed.  If another UA in the group selects the line (i.e. goes off hook), it is immediately bridged or joined in with the call.  This mimics the way residential telephone extensions usually operate.</t></section></section> <section title="Requirements">  <t> The basic requirements of the multiple appearance feature can be summarized as follows:</t><t>REQ-1 Incoming calls to the AOR must be offered to a group of UAs and can be answered by any of them.</t><t>REQ-2 Each UA in the group must be able to learn the call status of the others in the group for the purpose of rendering this information to the user.</t>t<t>REQ-3 Calls can be joined (also called bridged or conferenced together) or can be picked up (taken) by another UA in the group in a secure way.</t><t>REQ-4 The mechanism should require the minimal amount of configuration.  UAs registering against the group AOR should be able to learn about each other and join the appearance group.</t><t>REQ-5 The mechanism must scale for large numbers of appearances, n, and large numbers of UAs, N, without introducing excessive messaging traffic.</t><t>REQ-6 Each call or session (incoming or outgoing) must be assigned a common "appearance" number from a managed pool administered for the AOR group.  Once the session has terminated, the appearance number is released back into the pool and can be reused by another incoming or outgoing session.</t><t>REQ-7 Each UA in the group must be able to learn the appearance status of the the group.</t><t>REQ-8 There must be mechanisms to resolve appearance contention among the UAs in the group.</t><t>REQ-9 The mechanism must allow all UAs receiving an incoming session request to  select the same appearance number at the time of alerting. </t><t>REQ-10 The mechanism must have a way of reconstructing appearance state after an outage that does not result in excessive traffic and processing. </t><t>REQ-11 The mechanism must have backwards compatibility such that a UA which is unaware of the feature can still register against the group AOR and make and receive calls.</t><t>REQ-12 The mechanism must not allow UAs outside the group to select or manipulate appearance numbers.</t><t>REQ-13 For privacy reasons, there must be a mechanism so that appearance information is not leaked outside the group of UAs. (e.g. "So who do you have on line 1?")</t><t>REQ-14 The mechanism must support a way for UAs to request exclusivityon a line appearance. Exclusivity means that the UA requesting itdesires to  have a private conversation with the external party andother UAs must not  be allowed to barge-in. Exclusivity may be requestedat the start of an incoming or outgoing session or during the session.An exclusivity request may be accepted or rejected by the entityproviding the MA service. Therefore, the mechanism must provide a wayof communicating the result back to the requester UA.</t><t>REQ-15  The mechanism should support a way for a UA to select a particular appearance number for outgoing requests prior to sending the actual request.   This is often called seizure. </t><t>REQ-16  The mechanism should support a way for a UA to select a particular appearance number and also send the request at the same time.  This is needed when a ringdown feature is combined with multiple appearances - in this case, seizing the line is the same thing as dialing.</t></section>  <section title="Implementation Options">   <t>Many of the requirements for this service can be met using standard SIP mechanisms such as:</t><t> - A SIP Forking Proxy and Registrar/Location Service meets REQ-1.</t><t> - The SIP Dialog Package meets REQ-2.</t><t> - The SIP Replaces and Join header fields meets REQ-3.</t><t> - The SIP Registration Package meets REQ-4.</t><t>- The use of a State Agent for the Dialog Package meets REQ-5.</t><t>REQ-6 suggests the need for an entity which manages the appearance resource. Just as conferencing systems commonly have a single point of control, known as a focus, a Multiple Appearance group has a single point of control of the appearance shared resource. This is defined as an Appearance Agent for a group. While an Appearance Agent can be part of a centralized server, it could also be co-resident in a member User Agent who has taken on this functionality for a group. The Appearance Agent learns the group state either by subscribing to the dialog state of each member UA individually or by dialog state publications from members.</t><t>While the appearance resource could be managed co-operatively by a group of UAs without any central control, this is not discussed in this draft, but instead is left as a research project for future standardization.  It is also possible that the Appearance Agent logic could be distributed in all UAs in the group.  For example, rules that govern assigning appearance numbers for incoming requests (e.g. lowest available appearance number) and rules for contention handling (e.g. when two UAs request the use of the same appearance number, hash dialog identifiers and compare with the lowest hash winning) would need to be defined and implemented.</t><t>REQs 6-13 can be implemented using a number of approaches, as discussed in the following sections.</t><t>Figure 1 illustrates the SIP components involved in supporting these common requirements of the Multiple Appearance using standard SIP messages including REGISTER, INVITE, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, and PUBLISH.</t><figure><artwork><![CDATA[+----------------------------+                            +----+  |                            |                            |    ||     Appearance Agent       |                            | UA ||                            |                            |    |+----------------------------+                            +----+    ^ ^ |1)SUBSCRIBE  ^  ^    4)NOTIFY            INVITE     |    | | |(Event:reg)  |  | registration sip:alice@example.com|    | | V             |  |     events                        V    | | +--------------------+        +----------+7)Query+--------+                 | | |    (example.com)   |        |          |<===== |        |    | | |                    |3) Store| Location |       | Proxy  |    | | |     Registrar      |=======>|  Service |       |        |    | | |                    |        |          |=====> |        |    | | +--------------------+        +----------+8)Resp +--------+    | |     ^       ^                                       |  |    | |     |       |  2) REGISTER (alice)                  |  |    | |     |       |                                       |  |    | |   +----+ +----+                                     |  |    | |   |    | |    |                                     |  |    | |   |UA1 | |UA2 |                                     |  |    | |   |    | |    |                                     |  |    | |   +----+ +----+                                     |  |    | |    ^  ^    ^ ^                                      |  |    | |    |  |    | |                                      |  |    | +----+  |    | |                                      |  |    |         |    | +--------------------------------------+  |    |         +----+-------------------------------------------+    |              |              8) INVITE    +--------------+            sip:alice@example.com    5-7) SUBSCRIBE and/or PUBLISH          (Event:dialog)    ]]></artwork></figure> <t>  Figure 1. </t><t>The next section discusses normal SIP operations used to implement parts of the multiple appearance feature.</t><t><list style="numbers"><t>The Appearance Agent SUBSCRIBES to the registration event package as outlined in [8] for contacts registered to the group AOR. Thus, it has knowledge of all User Agents registered against the AOR at any point of time. </t><t>UAs (UA1 and UA2 in Figure 1) belong to the appearance group and, after authentication, register against the same AOR (e.g., sip:alice@example.com). </t><t>Each registration is stored in the Location Service. </t><t>The registrar notifies the Appearance Agent of successful registration at each UA.</t><t>UAs PUBLISH their dialog state to the State Agent in the Appearance Agent. Alternatively, the Appearance Agent could SUBSCRIBE to the dialog state of each UA in the group.</t><t>The UAs SUBSCRIBE to the Appearance Agent for the state of all dialogs as defined in [7].  The Request-URI of the SUBSCRIBE could be either the AOR of the group, the Contact URI information it received in the incoming subscription from the Appearance Agent, or a provisioned URI.</t><t>The UAs PUBLISH their dialog information to the Appearance Agent every time their dialog state changes (i.e. receive an INVITE, enter alerting state, answer a call, terminate a call, generate an INVITE, etc.)  Note that alternatively the Appearance Agent could also SUBSCRIBE to the dialog state of each UA in the group.</t><t>Forking Proxy forks an incoming INVITE for the AOR address to the registered user agents.</t></list></t><t>The User Agents in the group could SUBSCRIBE to each other and NOTIFY dialog state events, but in a large group the User Agents have to manage a larger number of SUBSCRIPTIONS and NOTIFICATIONS. The State Agent in the Appearance Agent helps in managing large groups better. Further, the State Agent can filter dialog state events and NOTIFY User Agents of the dialog state events which are required for the application or feature. The State Agent can also SUBSCRIBE to dialog state events with filters to reduce the number of NOTIFY messages exchanged between the State Agent and the user agents in the group. This allows a group of N UAs to each only establish a pair of dialog state subscriptions (one in each direction) to learn the dialog state of all other group members. This results in 2N total subscriptions for the entire group.  A full mesh of subscriptions without a state agent would result in N(N-1) total subscriptions.</t><t>The Appearance Agent can select the appearance number for an incoming call.  An Appearance agent can use the registration event package to learn how many UAs are part of the group.  The Appearance Agent sends a NOTIFY of dialog state events to all the User Agents.</t><section title="Appearance Implementation Options"> <t>This section discusses and compares two methods of implementing,   conveying, and selecting appearances in SIP while meeting the   requirements of Section 4.  One approach involves a URI parameter   and is discussed in section 5.1.1.  The other approach uses a SIP   dialog package extension parameter and is discussed in section   5.1.2.  Both approaches assume the common elements and operations   of Figure 1.  In addition, this section discusses approaches for incoming appearance indication, REQ-9, and appearance contention, REQ-8.  These approaches will be discussed for an example appearance group of N phones each with n line appearances.  The usage of the word phone does not imply that this feature is limited to telephony devices.</t><section title="URI parameter Approach"><t>Some implementations of this feature utilize a URI parameter such as "line=3" on the Contact URI.  Each appearance is effectively a logical UA, so each line appearance requires a separate registration.  The number of line appearances needs to be provisioned on each phone.  Each appearance also requires a separate dialog package subscription.  Even using a State Agent for the dialog package, each phone must maintain n subscriptions to the dialog package. </t><t>This results in 2nN total subscriptions and nN registrations for this implementation.</t><t>Since Contact URI parameters will be conveyed by the dialog package, REQ-7 is met. </t><t>REQ-10 can be met by having the Appearance Agent send a SUBSCRIBE to each UA and line number to obtain the current dialog state - this will result in nN SUBSCRIBEs and NOTIFYs.  </t><t>It is not obvious how to meet REQ-11 with this approach.  A UA registering against the AOR but does not implement the appearance URI parameter will not include a line appearance number in Contact URIs and dialog package NOTIFYs.  The Appearance Agent will have no way of indicating to the other UAs the appearance number being used by this UA, as adding a parameter to the Contact URI would cause call control operations such as Replaces and Join to fail.</t><t>REQs 12 and 13 are difficult to meet with this approach as the line appearance number will be present in the Request-URI of incoming requests and the Contact URI in INVITE and 200 OK messages.  This approach will require integrity protection of all dialog creating requests and responses, and privacy mechanisms to hide the Contact URI from other UAs.</t><t>Also, this approach will require mechanisms to protect against another UA sending an INVITE directly to a group member with the line appearance number already set.</t></section><section title="Dialog Package Parameter"><t>Instead of the URI parameter approach, consider an extension parameter "appearance" to the SIP dialog package.  The e.g.:</t> <figure><artwork><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0"?><dialog-info xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info"             xmlns:ma="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:ma-dialog-info"              version="6"             state="partial"             entity="sip:alice@example.com">   <dialog id="id3d4f9c83" from-tag="3423" to-tag="a3f423j88uju1"                                                      direction="initiator">       <ma:appearance>2</appearance>       <ma:exclusive>false</exclusive>       <ma:joined-dialog call-id="sdfg" from-tag="832d1" to-tag="4542454" />       <ma:joined-dialog call-id="873287876" from-tag="433" to-tag="jwjwuf5" />       <state>connected</state>       <local>           <target uri="sip:bob@pc.example.com" />       </local>   </dialog></dialog-info>...]]></artwork></figure><t>In this approach, the appearance number is never carried in a Request-URI or Contact URI.  Instead, it is only present in dialog package NOTIFY and PUBLISH messages.  As a result, only a single registration per AOR is required.  Also, only a single dialog package subscription in each direction per AOR.</t><t>This results in 2N total subscriptions and N registrations for this approach.</t><t>If the dialog package is extended to carry the appearance number, then REQ-7 is met. </t><t>REQ-10 can be met by having the Appearance Agent send a SUBSCRIBE to each UA and line number to obtain the current dialog state - this will result in N SUBSCRIBEs and NOTIFYs.  </t><t>REQ-11 can be met by this approach.  Even though a UA does not provide an appearance number in dialog package NOTIFYs, the Appearance Agent can assign one and include it in NOTIFYs to the other UAs.  This parameter would simply be ignored by the UAs that did not understand the parameter, and have no impact on call control operations.</t><t>REQs 12 and 13 are met because the appearance number is only conveyed in dialog package NOTIFYs.  Integrity and privacy of NOTIFY bodies can be achieved using normal SIP mechanisms independent of the security mechanisms used for other requests.</t><t>The dialog-package [7] describes a mechanism whereby shared-line privacy REQ-14can be accomplished by suppressing certain dialog information from beingpresented to the UAs. The reasoning behind that is if the UAs wereunaware of a dialog's call-id, local-tag and remote-tag then they willbe unable to  create requests such as INVITE with Join [9] or Replaces[5] headers to barge-in or pickup the line appearance. Below is a quotefrom section 3.6 of  dialog-package[7] that describes this approach:</t><t>      Note that many implementations of "shared-lines" have a feature      that allows details of calls on a shared address-of-record to be      made private.  This is a completely reasonable authorization      policy that could result in notifications that contain only the id      attribute of the dialog element and the state element when      shared-line privacy is requested, and notifications with more      complete information when shared-line privacy is not requested.</t><t>There are certain fundamental drawbacks in the privacy-by-obscurityapproach described in [7]. It models exclusivity as a static property ofthe appearance AOR. There are situations where exclusivity needs to be adynamic property (e.g. boss does not want secretary to listen-in on aparticular part of the conversation). In addition, [7] does not addresshow a UA can request exclusivity at the start of a session ormid-session and how that request will be granted or rejected. </t><t>Exclusivity being a dynamic property means that a UA can request it tobe turned on or off in the middle of a session. When exclusivity isturned off all the UAs that share the line AOR will need to see thecomplete dialog information. Once they have that information it can notbe taken back from them. This will not allow exclusivity to be turned onlater on in the dialog lifetime. Therefore, there needs to be acentralized entity that will actually enforce exclusivity.</t><t>The approach proposed for meeting REQ-14 is to include an exclusivity parameter to the dialog package.  This allows a UA to request exclusivity, by setting the exclusive parameter in notifications.  This could be done prior to a call being made or answered, or during a call at any time.  A UA can remove exclusivity by sending a notification at any time during a call and setting "exclusive=no". It also allows a UA to learn that a particular dialog is exclusive by the presence of this parameter in a NOTIFY.  In addition, a UA can still apply policy to any INVITE Join or Replaces requests it receives, as per normal SIP call control mechanisms.</t><t>With this approach, the number of appearances is centrally managed and controlled by the Appearance Agent.  For UAs with soft keys or buttons, this gives a great deal of flexibility in system management.</t></section><section title="Appearance Selections Mechanisms"><t>Regardless of how the appearance number is conveyed by UAs, there is still the issue of how appearance numbers are selected.  For example, some UAs might have actual buttons and lamps, and pressing a particular button requires the UA to reserve a particular appearance number.  For devices with this type of user interface, the selection must be done before the user continues with the call and dials digits or a URI.  Other UAs with different user interfaces can be flexible at the time of dialing, updating the display with the appearance number at a later date.  For devices which require advance appearance selection, there are three options discussed in the following sections for meeting REQ-15.</t><section title="Floor Control Appearance Selection Mechanism"><t>This approach models each appearance number as a floor (shared resource) and uses a floor control server to arbitrate exclusive access (seizure of a particular appearance number).  This approach uses a standard SIP Event State Compositor (ESC), a standard Floor Control Server that uses the Appearance Agent as Moderator.   The Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) is used between the UAs and the Floor Control Server.   A Registrar/Forking Proxy Server talks to Appearance Agent about incoming calls.  The Appearance Agent acts as a Moderator for the floor control server and tells forking proxy to insert the appearance number in incoming and outgoing requests.</t><t>Appearance numbers are allocated/selected/reserved in two ways:</t><t>For incoming calls, the Forking Proxy interacts with the Appearance Agent.  The Appearance Agent selects an appearance by taking a particular floor and marking it "moderator controlled".  This appearance number is then included by the Forking Proxy in INVITEs using the Alert-Info parameter.  When a UA answers the call, it takes the appearance number from the Alert-Info and includes it in the dialog state publication.  It then requests the floor associated with the appearance number from the floor control server, which forwards the request to the Appearance Agent (moderator).  The Appearance Agent correlates the floor control request with the dialog state notification with the dialog ID from the INVITE with the Alert-Info.  If they match, the floor is granted.  If they do not match, it means the floor request is not an answer of the call but is a random appearance selection by the UA and will be rejected.</t><t>For outgoing calls, the UA sends an INVITE and requests a particular floor from the floor control server.  Depending on the User Interface requirements, the floor request can be done before or after sending the INVITE.  The floor grant policy for most appearances is set to "first come first serve".  Once the floor has been granted and the call answered, the dialog state publication by the UA will include the appearance number.</t><t>When a call has ended, the UA releases the floor to the floor control server and this appearance is now available for incoming and outgoing calls.</t><t>When a UA in the group which does not support BFCP is in a call, the Appearance Agent will grant the floor associated with that appearance to that UA.  When that call is over, the Appearance Agent will release the floor.  Since the UA will not publish the appearance number to the ESC, the Appearance Agent will need to do that on their behalf.  If the UA does publish dialog state but without the appearance number, the Appearance Agent will still need to re-publish the dialog state including the appearance number.  UAs in the group will be able to recognize these two dialogs as one since they will have the same SIP dialog ID.</t></section><section title="INVITE Appearance Selection Mechanism"><t>This is an alternative approach that utilizes sending an INVITE to select/reserve/seize an appearance number.</t><t>A UA that does not need to select a particular appearance number (or doesn't care) would just send an INVITE as normal.    The Appearance Agent would tell the proxy which appearance number was being used by inserting this information in a header field in the first non-100 provisional response sent back to the calling UA.  The UA would then PUBLISH this appearance number to the Dialog Event State Compositor for the AOR which would distribute details of the dialog and the appearance number to the other UAs in the group.</t><t>If an INVITE is sent and no appearance number is available, the proxy would reject the INVITE with a suitable response code and perhaps a header field indication.</t><t>A UA that does need to select a particular appearance number would use an approach similar to overlap dialing (multi-stage dialing).  An INVITE would be sent when the appearance number is requested (i.e. when the button is pressed, before dialing begins).  The appearance number selected would be carried in the INVITE, in a header field or in the Request-URI, for example.  The proxy would reject the INVITE with a 484 Address Incomplete response (see RFC 3578) if the appearance number is Available and start a timer.  The UA could then resend the INVITE after the URI has been dialed and then PUBLISH this appearance number to the ESC.  If the appearance number is not available, another response code such as 403 would be sent.  The user could then select a different appearance number and resend the INVITE.  If no INVITE with a matching Call-ID is received before the timer expires, the appearance seizure is cancelled and is made available for other calls.</t><t>Note that this approach does not actually require a B2BUA, but it does require a proxy that can act as a UAS and communicate with an Appearance Agent which keeps track of appearance number allocations.</t><t>Figure 2 shows a call flow for a UA which does not need to seize an appearance.  The proxy inserts a header field into F8 which tells Alice which appearance number is being used for this call.  Alice then publishes this to the other UAs in the group so they know this appearance is available.  When the proxy sees the BYE F16, it frees up the appearance number, and Alice publishes the end of the dialog which tells the other UAs the appearance number is no longer in use.</t><figure><artwork><![CDATA[   Alice           Proxy 1          Proxy 2            Bob     |                |                |                |     |   INVITE F1    |                |                |     |--------------->|   INVITE F2    |                |     |     100  F3    |--------------->|   INVITE F5    |     |<---------------|     100  F4    |--------------->|     |                |<---------------|                |     |                |                |     180 F6     |     |                |    180 F7      |<---------------|     | 180 (app=2) F8 |<---------------|                |     |<---------------|                |     200 F9     |     |                |    200 F10     |<---------------|     |     200 F11    |<---------------|                |     |<---------------|                |                |     |     ACK F12    |                |                |     |--------------->|    ACK F13     |                |     |                |--------------->|     ACK F14    |     |                |                |--------------->|     |                Both Way RTP Media                |     |<================================================>|     |                |                |     BYE F15    |     |                |    BYE F16     |<---------------|     |     BYE F17    |<---------------|                |     |<---------------|                |                |     |     200 F18    |                |                |     |--------------->|     200 F19    |                |     |                |--------------->|     200 F20    |     |                |                |--------------->|     |                |                |                |Figure 2.

Appearance Seizure Timeout Call Flow]]></artwork></figure></section><section title="PUBLISH Appearance Selection Mechanism"><t>The approach used in previous versions of this draft is to use the PUBLISH (or NOTIFY) to the event state compositor to select an appearance number.  This approach requires a special event state compositor and special behavior on the part of the UA.</t><t>In the selection of an appearance for requests initiated by UAs in the group, there is the possibility of contention where more than one UA select the same appearance number.    </t><t>One way to solve this and meet REQ-8 is to require UAs to send a notification (trying) to the Appearance Agent indicating the appearance number to be used for the session.  The Appearance Agent would confirm the allocation of the appearance number in a NOTIFY sent to the group UAs.  Should the appearance number be unavailable or otherwise not allowed, there are two options:</t><t>- The notification could be rejected with a 500 response and a Retry-After header field.  The Appearance Agent would send an immediate NOTIFY indicating that the appearance is unavailable. If the NOTIFY is received before the expiration of the Retry-After time, the notification state information would become out of date and would be discarded without resending.  The UA would select another appearance number and send another notification.</t><t>- The notification could be accepted but an immediate NOTIFY generated by the Appearance Agent indicating that the appearance is unavailable.  The UA would then select another appearance number and PUBLISH again.</t><t>UAs would wait for a notification from the Appearance Agent before sending the INVITE.</t></section></section></section><section title="Comparison"><t>In comparing the URI parameter and the dialog package parameter, there are clear differences in the number of registrations and subscriptions, with the dialog package approach requiring n times fewer in both cases.</t><t>The security model for the dialog package parameter approach is much cleaner, since only NOTIFYs need integrity and privacy.  The security model for the URI parameter approach would likely require a B2BUA which introduces many undesirable properties.</t><t>The dialog package parameter approach has better backwards compatibility than the URI parameter approach.</t><t>In summary, the dialog package parameter approach better meets REQs 5, 10, 11, 12, and 13 while the URI parameter approach better meets REQ-9.  However, the combined dialog package parameter approach and the Alert-Info parameter approach meets REQ-9.</t><t>The rest of this document discusses the dialog package parameter approach.</t><section title="Comparison of Appearance Selection Methods"><t>All three approaches meet REQ-15 and REQ-16.</t><t>Previous versions of this draft proposed the publish/notify method of appearance selection.  The advantage of this approach is that the appearance number is only carried in one place (dialog package XML documents) and the same protocol/mechanism is used to select and learn appearance numbers.  The disadvantage of this approach is that a specialized event state compositor must be used, since it is aware of appearance numbers.  Also, concerns have been raised about whether this approach defines new semantics for publish/notify beyond that in RFC 3265.</t><t>The floor control approach makes good reuse of existing protocols such as Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) and cleanly models the state.  However, while BFCP can be used in conferencing applications, it is unlikely most UAs implementing multiple appearances would utilize the protocol.  Also, having appearance state in two places (dialog package XML documents and floor control messages) complicates the application.  Also, BFCP only runs over TCP and requires a separate offer/answer exchange to establish the connection, making operation through NATs and firewalls more difficult.</t><t>The INVITE approach does not require any new protocols and makes only small behavior changes to the UA operation.  It reuses standard overlap dialing methods defined in RFC 3574.  As such, it seems a good candidate for standardization.  An open issue is how to set the Request-URI in the first INVITE and the way the proxy conveys the appearance number to UAs in 18x or 2xx responses.</t></section></section></section><!--  Start of Commented out section<section title="Normative Description"><t>This section normatively describes the MA feature extensions.</t><section title="MA Dialog Package Extensions"><t>This specification defines three new elements as extensions to the SIP Dialog Event package [7].

All three elements are sub-elements of the &lt;dialog&gt; element.</t><section title="The &lt;appearance&gt; element"><t>The &lt;appearance&gt; element is used convey the appearance number.  The appearance number is a non-negative integer.  When sent in a notification in state Trying to the Appearance Agent, it is used to request an appearance number.  When sent by the Appearance Agent, it indicates that the appearance number is associated with a dialog.</t><t>When used to select an appearance number, the attributes "selection", "start", and "stop" may be present.  The "selection" attribute is used to indicate UA preference in the appearance number selection as follows.  If an appearance number is included in the element, and that appearance number is available, the Appearance Agent will assign that appearance number to the dialog and return a NOTIFY containing the appearance number in an &lt;appearance&gt; element.  If the appearance number is not available, or no appearance number is present, then:</t><t>- If selection=only is set, the Appearance Agent will return a NOTIFY without an &lt;appearance&gt; element. </t><t>- If selection=any is set, the Appearance Agent may select any available appearance and include this appearance in the NOTIFY.  </t><t>- If selection=range is set, the attributes "start" and "stop" MUST be present. The Appearance Agent may return any available appearance number that is in the range set by the "start" and "stop" attributes.  If none are available, no appearance number is assigned.</t><t>- If selection=set is set, the Appearance Agent may return any available appearance number which is listed in the comma separated set. If none are available, no appearance number is assigned.</t></section><section title="The &lt;exclusive&gt; element"><t>The &lt;exclusive&gt; element is a boolean used indicate whether the UA will accept Join or Replaces INVITEs for this dialog. For example, some MA systems only allow call takes when the call is on hold.  In this case, the &lt;exclusive&gt; element should be used to explicitly indicate this, rather than implicitly by the hold state.</t><t>It is important to note that this element is a hint. Although a UA may set exclusive to true, the UA must still be ready to reject an INVITE Join relating to this dialog.  Also, an INVITE Replaces might be sent to the non-MA UA to take the call.  For this reason, a UA MAY also not report full dialog identifier information to the Appearance Agent for calls set to exclusive.  If these dialog identifiers have already been shared with the Appearance Agent, the UA could send an INVITE Replaces to change them and then not report the new ones to the Appearance Agent.</t><t>If the proxy knows which dialogs are marked exclusive, the proxy MAY enforce this exclusivity by rejecting INVITE Join and INVITE Replace requests containing those dialog identifiers with a 403 Forbidden response.</t></section><section title="The &lt;joined-dialog&gt; element"><t>The &lt;joined-dialog&gt; element is used convey dialog identifiers of any other dialogs which are joined (mixed or bridged) with the dialog.  Only the UA which is performing the actual media mixing should include this element in notifications to the Appearance Agent.  Note that this element should still be used even when the Join header field was not used to join the dialogs.  For example, two separate dialogs on a UA could be joined without any SIP call control operations.  The UA would report this using this header field.</t></section></section> <section title="Multiple Appearance User Agents"><t>User Agents that support the Multiple Appearance feature MUST support the dialog state package as outlined in [7] to NOTIFY the Appearance Agent of the dialog-state. </t><t>User Agents MUST support Replaces [5] and MAY support Join [9].  Note that for the Call Take operation, the remote UA must support Replaces.  If the UA does not support Join, it SHOULD support conference creation in [11].</t><t>Editor's Note: Should this be a MUST?  If not, bridging could fail.</t><t>They MUST support the MA extensions to the dialog package defined in this specification.  They SHOULD understand and support the (ma) event parameter outlined in this draft. </t><t>When generating dialog package notifications, UAs MUST include full dialog identification information including local and remote target URIs (Contacts) call-id, to-tag and from-tag.  The exception is when a UA does not want other UAs in the group to be able to Join or Take the call.  In this case, the dialog identification information MAY be omitted in addition to setting the exclusive flag.  When calls are placed on hold, the "+sip.rendering=no" [12]  feature tag MUST be included in dialog package notifications.</t><t>The UA MUST send dialog-info in state "trying" with the appropriate appearance parameter present in the local target when it is attempting to select ('seize') an appearance number. If the user interface of the UA requires that it know the appearance number before the call is placed, the UA can not send the INVITE until a NOTIFY from the Appearance Agent is received confirming the appearance number selection.  </t><t>Note: Sending NOTIFY dialog state of (trying) before an INVITE is a departure from [7], but this must be implemented by UAs that need to select a specific appearance number for a call.</t><t>There are two exceptions to the requirement for seizing an appearance before sending an INVITE.  One is an emergency call, which should proceed regardless of the status of NOTIFY/PUBLISH transaction.  The other is when the INVITE is an attempt to bridge or take a call (i.e. contains Join or Replaces with a dialog identifier of another member of the MA group). In this case, the INVITE Join or Replaces should be sent without selecting an appearance.  After the INVITE succeeds, the NOTIFY/PUBLISH MUST be sent, reusing the appearance number of the dialog that has been bridged or taken.  </t><t>UAs can tell that a set of dialogs are joined (bridged or mixed) together by the presence of one or more &lt;joined-dialog&gt; elements containing other SIP dialog identifiers.</t><t>There are a number of ways in which a UA can request an appearance number from the Appearance Agent.  They are:</t><figure><artwork><![CDATA[1. <appearance selection="any" />   This allows the Appearance Agent to select any appearance number on behalf of the requesting UA.2. <appearance selection="any">2</appearance>   This allows the Appearance Agent to select appearance 2 if available, if not, assign any appearance number.3. <appearance selection="only">3</appearance>   This allows the Appearance Agent to select appearance 3 if available, but make no selection if it is not available.4. <appearance selection="range" start="0" stop="5" />   This allows the Appearance Agent to select an appearance number within the range 0-5.]]></artwork></figure><t>The dialog state package defined in [7] defines the set of messages that MAY be provided by a UA to publish state information of dialogs. For satisfactory operation of this feature, the flows require that the UA SUBSCRIBE to the dialog-event package on receipt of a SUBSRIBE request containing the "ma" event parameter. It MUST use the contact in this SUBSCRIBE for making 'line reservations' when placing calls from the AOR. Also, as seen in the above example message flows, not all of these messages need to be published by a UA to effectively participate in a BLA group. In order to indicate this preference, this draft proposes a new Event parameter for the dialog package called (ma). User Agents that understand this parameter will always provide dialog state information as detailed in this draft. </t><t>A UA should only register against the AOR if it is likely the UA will be answering incoming calls.  If the UA is mainly going to be monitoring the status of the MA group calls and taking or joining calls, the UA SHOULD only subscribe to the Appearance Agent and not register against the AOR.</t></section><section title="Appearance Agent"><t>An Appearance Agent defined in this specification MUST implement a dialog package state agent for the UAs registered against the AOR.</t><t>The dialog package XML element dialog id (NOT the SIP dialog identifier consisting of the Call-ID, To tag, and From tag) is used for partial update processing.  RFC 4235 only requires the dialog id be unique for the UA, not unique across all UAs associated with the same AOR.  As a result, is possible that two UAs in a MA group might choose the same XML element dialog id for different dialogs.  If this is the case, the Appearance Agent, acting as the dialog package event state compositor may need to produce different notification documents for the UAs that have conflicting dialog package XML element dialog ids.</t><t>The Appearance Agent MUST support the appearance dialog package extensions defined in this specification.</t><t>Even in trivial deployments of two multiple appearance enabled user agents, race conditions can exist when both user agents attempt to utilize an appearance simultaneously (i.e. when the NOTIFY messages, that each user agent sends to the other, are active within the network during an overlapping time period). The Appearance Agent can use any policy deemed necessary to resolve races and ensure no two user agents are not allocated the same appearance number at the same time.</t><t>Appearance Agents are responsible for resolving conflicts in the appearance resource.  If a UA requests the use of an appearance number that is in use by another UA, the Appearance Agent will respond based on the presence of the selection attribute in the &lt;appearance&gt; element as described in the previous section.</t><t>In the case where a UA is bridging two calls, the Appearance Agent may receive dialog package NOTIFYs/PUBLISHes that contain multiple dialogs with the same appearance number.  This is valid and does not represent appearance number contention.</t><t>A critical aspect for reliable operation of this feature is the ability for all user agents in the BLA group to recover from network failures caused at a single UA. For example, one of the user agents in the BLA group may have answered an incoming call, notified the dialog state to other members and then experienced a network outage. The calling UA could have detected the same (using RTP or some other means) and could have hung up. However, none of the other user agents in the BLA group would get notification of this change in dialog state and their BLA appearances could stay out of sync for a long time; depending on when the network is restored, or when the Appearance Agent attempts to refresh its dialog-state subscription with the failed UA. To recover from such a failure, the Appearance Agent MUST SUBSCRIBE with a shorter expiration (expiration interval not smaller than 300 seconds is RECOMMENDED) following the notification of a "confirmed" dialog or when a Appearance Agent honors a "trying" for call origination, with the user agents that notified it of this information.</t><t>Alternatively, while a user agent is acquiring, or holds a line seize, the dialog subscriptions to it act as MA status indicators to the subscriber. If subscription refresh requests to the user agent are not honored, then it must be determined that the user agent's capacity to maintain line seize has been lost. For this reason, during the period a user agent is acquiring or holds a line seize, the remaining expiry period of subscriptions to it MAY be reduced by the Appearance Agent to minimize the outage problem (expiration interval not smaller than 300 seconds is RECOMMENDED). This can be accomplished by setting the Expires parameter in the Subscription-State header in the NOTIFY message sent out by the UA.</t></section></section><section title="XML Schema Definition"><t>   The 'appearance' and 'exclusive' elements are defined within a new XML   namespace URI.

Also, rendering the correct call/appearance state to users is also important.</t><section title="Appearance Number Rendering"><t>Since different UAs have different user interface capabilities, itis usual to find that some UAs have restrictions that others do not.Perfect interoperability across all UAs is clearly not possible, butby careful design, interoperability up to the limits of each UA canbe achieved.</t><t>The following guidelines suggest how the appearance number should behandled in three typical user interface implementations.</t><section title="Single Appearance UAs"><t> These devices are constrained by only having thecapability of displaying status indications for a single appearance.Despite this, it is important that devices of this type do not ignorethe appearance number.  The UA should still send messages annotated withan appropriate appearance number (i.e. "0").  Any call indications forappearances other than for number "0" should be rejected with a 486 or 480 response.</t></section><section title="Dual Appearance UAs"><t>These devices are essentially single line phones that implement call waiting.  They have a very simple user interface that allows them to switch between two appearances (toggle or flash hook) and perhaps audible tones to indicate the status of the other appearance.</t></section><section title="Multiple Appearance UAs with Fixed Appearance Number"><t>This UA is the typical 'business-class' hard-phone.  A number of appearances aretypically configured statically and labeled on buttons, and calls may be managed using these configured appearances.  Any calls outside this range should be ignored, and not mapped to a free button.  Users of these devices often select specific appearance numbers for outgoing calls, and the UA will need to select the appearance number and wait for confirmation from the Appearance Agent before proceeding with calls.</t></section><section title="Multiple Appearance UAs with Variable Appearance Number"><t>This UA is typically a soft-phone or graphically rich user interface hard-phone.  In these cases,even the idea of an appearance index may seem unnecessary.  However,for these phones to be able to interwork successfully with other phonetypes, it is important that they still use the appearance index to governthe order of appearance of calls in progress.  No specific guidanceon presentation is given except that the order should be consistent.Thought should also be given to how an appearance number that has no callassociated with it should be rendered to the user.  These devices can typically make calls without waiting for confirmation from the Appearance Agent on the appearance number.</t></section><t>The problems faced by each style of user interface are readily seen inthis example:</t><t><list style="numbers"><t>A call arrives at the MA group, and is assigned an appearance numberof 0.  All UAs should be able to render to the user the arrival of this call.</t><t>Another call arrives at the MA group, and is assigned an appearancenumber of 1.  The single appearance UA should not present this call to the user.  Other user agents should have no problems presenting this call distinctly from the first call.</t><t>The first call clears, releasing appearance number "0".  The single appearance UA should now be indicating no calls since it is unable to manage calls other than on the first appearance.  Both multiple appearance UAs should clearly show that appearance number 0 is now free, but thatthere is still a call on appearance number 1.</t><t>A third call arrives, and is assigned the appearance number of 0.All UAs should be able to render the arrival of this new call to the user.Multiple appearnce UAs should continue to indicate the presence of the secondcall, and should also ensure that the presentation order is related tothe appearance number and not the order of call arrival.</t></list></t></section><section title="Call State Rendering"><t>UAs that implement the MA feature typically have a user interface that provides the state of other appearances in the group.  As dialog state NOTIFYs from the Appearance Agent are processed, this information can be rendered.  Even the simplest user interface typically has three states: idle, active, and hold.  The idle state, usually indicated by lamp off, is indicated for an appearance when the appearance number is not associated with any dialogs, as reported by the Appearance Agent.  The active state, usually indicated by a lamp on, is indicated by an appearance number being associated with at least one dialog, as reported by the Appearance Agent.  The hold state, often indicated by a blinking lamp, means the call state from the perspective of the UA in the MA group is hold.  This can be determined by the presence of the "sip+rendering=no" feature tag with the local target URI.  Note that the hold state of the remote target URI is not relevant to this display.  For joined dialogs, the state is rendered as hold only if all local target URIs are indicated with the "sip+rendering=no" feature tag.</t></section></section><section title="Interop with non-MA UAs"><t>It is desirable to allow a basic UA that does not directlysupport MA to be part of a MA group. To support this the Proxymust collaborate with the Appearance Agent. This is not required inthe basic MA architecture, consequently MA interop with non-MA UAswill not be available in all MA deployments.</t><t>First, a UA which does not support dialog events or the MA feature will be discussed.  Then, a UA which does support dialog events but not the MA feature will be discussed.</t><section title="Appearance Assignment"><t>A UA that has no knowledge of appearances must have appearance numbers assigned by the Appearance Agent for both incoming and outgoing calls.  The Appearance Agent will know about this type of UA as the UA will be registered against the AOR but not subscribed to the dialog events for the AOR. If the non-MA UA does not support Join or Replaces, all dialogs could be marked "exclusive" to indicate that these options are not available.</t></section><section title="Appearance Release"> <t>In all cases the Appearance Agent must be aware of dialog lifetime to release appearances back into the group. </t><t>It is also desirable that any dialog state changes (such as hold, etc) be made available to other UAs in the group through the Dialog Event Package. If the Appearance Agent includes a proxy which Record-Routes for dialogs from the non-MA aware UA, the Appearance Agent will know about the state of dialogs including hold, etc.  This information could be determined from inspection of INVITE and re-INVITE messages and added to the dialog information conveyed to other UAs.  </t></section><section title="UAs Supporting Dialog Events but Not MA"><t>Interoperability with UAs which support dialog events but not the MA feature is more straightforward.  As before, all appearance number assignment must be done by the Appearance Agent.  This type of UA will be detected by the Appearance Agent by the absence of the ma event parameter in SUBSCRIBE or PUBLISH messages.  The Appearance Agent can include appearance information in NOTIFYs - this UA will simply ignore this extra information.  This type of UA will ignore appearance number limitations and may attempt to Join or Replace dialogs marked exclusive.  As a result, the Proxy or UAs may need to reject such requests.</t><t>The need for close cooperation between the Proxy and the Appearance Agent is not needed as the Appearance Agent will learn about all dialogs from the UA itself.</t></section></section><section title="Provisioning Considerations"><t>TBD.</t></section><!--  Start of Commented out section<section title="Example Message Flows"><t>The next section shows call flow and message examples.

This type of race condition is often referred to in telephony as a glare condition. Appearance Agent may use any desired policy to decide which UA receives the appearance and which does not.  In this case UA1 obtains the appearance number, as indicated by the NOTIFY from the Appearance Agent with the appearance number.  UA2 learns that it did not obtain the appearance number since its NOTIFY does not contain the appearance number from its NOTIFY.</t></section></section>-->  End of commented out sections<section title="IANA Considerations"><t> This section registers the SIP Alert-Info header field parameter "appearance" and the XML namespace extensions to the SIP Dialog Package.</t><section title="SIP Event Package Parameter: ma"><t>This specification also defines a new event parameter "ma" for the Dialog Package.</t></section><section title="URN Sub-Namespace Registration: ma-dialog-info"><figure><artwork><![CDATA[   This section registers a new XML namespace per the procedures in   [RFC3688].   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:ma-dialog-info.    Registrant Contact: IETF BLISS working group, <bliss@ietf.org>,   Alan Johnston <alan@sipstation.com>   XML:   BEGIN      <?xml version="1.0"?>      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML Basic 1.0//EN"                "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic10.dtd">      <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">      <head>        <meta http-equiv="content-type"           content="text/html;charset=iso-8859-1"/>        <title>Multiple Appearance Dialog Information Namespace</title>      </head>      <body>        <h1>Namespace for Multiple Appearance Dialog Information</h1>        <h2>urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info</h2>        <p>See <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfcXXXX.txt">             RFCXXXX</a>.</p>      </body>      </html>   END]]></artwork></figure></section><section title="XML Schema Registration"><figure><artwork><![CDATA[   This section registers an XML schema per the procedures in [RFC3688].    URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:ma-dialog-info.    Registrant Contact: IETF BLISS working group, <bliss@ietf.org>,    Alan Johnston <alan@sipstation.com>   The XML for this schema can be found in Section 7.]]></artwork></figure></section></section><section title="Appendix A - Incoming Appearance Assignment"><t>To best meet REQ-9, the appearance number for an incoming INVITE should be contained in the INVITE itself. </t><t> For the dialog package parameter approach, REQ-9 could be met in two ways.  When an incoming request is received, the Appearance Agent could send out a NOTIFY with state trying and include the appearance number to be used for this request.  Upon receipt of this NOTIFY, the UAs could begin alerting using the appearance number selected.  This approach is sub-optimal since the UAs could receive the INVITE but be unable to begin alerting if the NOTIFY from the Appearance Agent is delayed or lost</t><t>An alternative approach is to define an extension parameter for the Alert-Info header field in RFC 3261 such as:</t><t>Alert-Info: &lt;file://ring.pcm>;alert=normal;appearance=0</t><t>This Alert-Info header would indicate to place the call on the first line appearance instance.</t><t>The determination as to what value to use in the appearance parameter can be done at the proxy that forks the incoming request to all the registered UAs. There are a variety of ways the proxy can use to determine what value it should use to populate this parameter. For example, the proxy could fetch this information by initiating a SUBSCRIBE request with Expires: 0 to the Appearance Agent for the AOR to fetch the list of lines that are in use. Alternatively, it could act like a UA that is a part of the appearance group and SUBSCRIBE to the State-Agent like any other UA. This would ensure that the active dialog information is available without having to poll on a need basis. It could keep track of the list of active calls for the appearance AOR based on how many unique INVITE requests it has forked to or received from the appearance AOR. Another approach would be for the Proxy to first send the incoming INVITE to the Appearance Agent which would redirect to the appearance group URI and escape the proper Alert-Info header field for the Proxy to recurse and distribute to the other UAs in the group.</t><t>The Appearance Agent needs to know about all incoming requests to the AOR in order to select the appearance number.  One way in which this could be done is for the Appearance Agent to register against the AOR with a higher q value.  This will result in the INVITE being sent to the Appearance Agent first, then being offered to the UAs in the group. </t><t>The changes to RFC 3261 ABNF would be:</t><t>alert-param  =  LAQUOT absoluteURI RAQUOT *( SEMI (generic-param / appearance-param) )</t><t>appearance-param = "appearance" EQUAL *DIGIT</t></section><section title="Acknowledgements"><t>The following individuals were part of the MA Design team and have   provided input and text to the document (in alphabetical order):</t><t>   Andrew Hutton, Raj Jain, Fernando Lombardo, Derek MacDonald,   Bill Mitchell, Michael Procter, Theo Zowzouvillys.</t><t>   Thanks to Chris Boulton for helping with the XML schema.  </t><t>   Much of the material has been drawn from previous work by Mohsen    Soroushnejad, Venkatesh Venkataramanan, Paul Pepper and Anil Kumar,   who in turn received assistance from:</t><t>   Kent Fritz, John Weald, and Sunil Veluvali of Sylantro Systems,    Steve Towlson, and Michael Procter of Citel Technologies,    Rob Harder and Hong Chen of Polycom Inc,    John Elwell, J D Smith of Siemens Communications,    Dale R.

For example, a rogue UA could snoop for these identifiers and send an INVITE with Replaces header containing these call details to take over the call. As such INVITES with Replaces header MUST be authenticated using the standard mechanism (like Digest or S/MIME) described in RFC 3261 [2] before it is accepted. NOTIFY message bodies that provide the dialog state information and the dialog identifiers MAY be encrypted end-to-end using the standard mechanics.All SUBSCRIBES between the UA's and the Appearance Agent MUST be authenticated. </t></section></middle><back><references title="Informative References"><?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119" ?><?rfc include="reference.RFC.3261" ?><?rfc include="reference.RFC.3515" ?><?rfc include="reference.RFC.3265" ?><?rfc include="reference.RFC.3891" ?><?rfc include="reference.I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples" ?><?rfc include="reference.RFC.4235" ?><?rfc include="reference.RFC.3680" ?><?rfc include="reference.RFC.3911" ?><?rfc include="reference.RFC.3325" ?><?rfc include="reference.RFC.4579" ?><?rfc include="reference.RFC.3840" ?></references></back></rfc>
