Abstract

   This memo defines two new Multi Topology Routing Identifiers (MT IDs)
   in OSPFv3 [RFC2740]).  These new MT-OSPFv3 [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3]
   topologies are meant to convey routing information which is
   restricted to IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].  The goal of running separate
   instances for IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes is to isolate the IPv6 routing
   table from the IPv4 routing table, and to avoid any overload due to
   the population of the table by IPv4-inferred routes.  This isolation
   is motivated also from an operational perspective to enforce specific
   routing policies for each topology.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft         IPv4-mapped IPv6 MT-OSPFv3           October 2009


1.  Introduction

   MT-OSPFv3 [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3] is a mechanism that has been
   specified to run various topologies based on several criteria such as
   the need to distinguish the IPv6 routing topology from the IPv4
   routing topology.  Distinct MT IDs (Multi topology Identifiers) are
   assigned by IANA (e.g., MT ID # 0 for IPv6 routing topology, MT ID #
   3 for IPv6 multicast topology, etc.).  MT ID # 5-#31 range is
   reserved for IETF consensus.  This document requests the assignment
   of two new MT IDs for the following usages:

   o  Unicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 topology;

   o  Multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 topology.

   Within the double context of IPv4 address exhaustion and the IPv6-
   IPv4 interconnection, numerous solutions are being elaborated within
   IETF.  Both translation (e.g., [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]
   and [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate]) and encapsulation (e.g.,
   [I-D.boucadair-dslite-interco-v4v6] and
   [I-D.boucadair-behave-ipv6-portrange]) based schemes are proposed to
   allow IPv6-IPv4 interconnection.  These solutions require injecting
   in intra-domain routing protocols routes to IPv4-mapped IPv6
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] destinations.

   In order to prevent any overload of the native IPv6 routing table
   with IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes, this memo defines new MT IDs which are
   required for the activation of multiple topologies, where the native
   IPv6 topology would be distinct from the IPv4-mapped topology.  This
   is also motivated for operational reasons and to ease the migration
   to full IPv6.  As a result, the unicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 topology is
   used for unicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 route computation purposes, and the
   multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 topology is used for multicast IPv4-mapped
   IPv6 route computation purposes.

   As a reminder, [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt] sspecifies a mechanism to
   maintain multiple topologies.  In particular, each topology is
   created by a separate OSPFv3 instance identified by a unique Instance
   ID.  Each instance maintains its own neighbour adjacencies, link
   state database and SPF computation.  Network administrators have to
   make their decisions based on local policies and preferences as to
   which mechanism to deploy.  If MT-OSPFv3 mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3] is deployed in an OSPFv3 network as a
   preference for multiple topologies, the extensions defined in this
   memo may be used to support unicast/multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6
   routing.

2.  Procedure

   This document does not require any modification to the procedure
   specified in [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3].  Nevertheless, only routes to
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 prefixes MUST be instantiated within an IPv4-mapped
   IPv6 routing MT-OSPFv3.  Concretely, the IANA prefix defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] MUST be supported by default.
   Service providers MAY also choose a LIR prefix to build the IPv4-
   mapped IPv6 addresses.


3.  Forwarding

   Only incoming datagrams destined to IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses are
   associated (and therfore forwarded according to ) with the IPv4-
   mapped IPv6 unicast/multicast topology, respectively.  WKP and/or LIR
   prefix defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] MUST be configured
   in all participating nodes.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the following MT-OSPFv3 IDs:

   o  MT ID# for IPv4-mapped IPv6 unicast topology

   o  MT ID# for multicast IPv4-mapped IPv6 topology.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security issue in addition to
   those defined in [RFC2740].
