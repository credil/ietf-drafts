                     Sharing Transaction Fraud Data     July 2008 
        
       1.           Introduction 
        
       Financial organizations and merchants that offer online access 
       to their services frequently encounter fraud perpetrated against 
       their customers' accounts. In their attempts to combat these 
       frauds, the organizations and their law enforcement agencies 
       could benefit greatly by sharing intelligence about fraud 
       incidents and patterns with similar organizations and agencies. 
       This specification standardizes a document format by which they 
       can share such information. It is intended to facilitate multi-
       vendor interoperability between conformant components of an open 
       fraud reporting framework. 
        
       Information sharing can take place directly between financial 
       organizations and merchants. However, the power of shared 
       intelligence is multiplied many times if the information is 
       gathered from multiple sources by a shared network, consolidated 
       and redistributed to participants. 
        
       In this arrangement, incident reports submitted to the network 
       are called inbound reports, and reports issued by the network 
       are called outbound reports. 
        
       Inbound reports will be submitted using a push-style protocol 
       (such as email or SOAP). And outbound reports will either be 
       distributed using a push-style protocol or a request/response 
       protocol (such as HTTP). 
        
       Inbound reports identify the contributor of the report, as this 
       information is essential in evaluating the quality of the 
       information it contains and in contacting the source for the 
       purpose of clarification. But, outbound reports commonly do not 
       identify the original sources, as those sources may not wish to 
       be identified to other subscribers. Such reports should, 
       instead, identify the consolidator as the source. 
        
       A report may describe a particular transaction that is known to 
       be, or believed to be, fraudulent, or it may describe a pattern 
       of behavior that is believed to be indicative of fraud.  The 
       former type of report is called an 'activity report' and the 
       latter a 'signature report'. 
        
       The schema defined herein extends the IODEF XML incident 
       reporting schema [RFC5070]. 
        
       In section 3 we introduce the actors in a typical transaction 
       fraud. Fraud reporting by means of an IODEF-Document is 
       described in section 4. We define the elements of a Thraud 
       Report in section 5. In section 6 we describe the Activity 
       Thraud Report profile of the IODEF specification. And in section 
       7 the profile for a Signature Thraud Report is described. In 
       section 8 we define new attribute values for the IODEF Incident

       class. Security considerations are described in section 9. And, 
       Section 10 contains a request to IANA to register the associated 
       media sub-type and XML namespace identifier.  The Appendices 
       contain the complete XML schema and a sample Thraud Report. 
        
       Data elements in this document are expressed in Unified Modeling 
       Language (UML) syntax [UML]. 
        
       XML namespace prefixes are used throughout this document to 
       stand for their respective XML namespaces, as follows.

              Figure 1. Transaction Fraud Elements 
        
       Transaction fraud activities normally involve the following 
       actors: 
        
           1. Fraudsters are individuals or organizations that collect 
       victims' login credentials using a variety of means, including 
       phishing and malware, and verify them (usually by attempting to 
       login to the victim's account). Then the Fraudsters may either 
       recruit Fraud Executors themselves or wholesale the victims' 
       credentials to other Fraudsters, who will, in turn, recruit 
       Fraud Executors. 
        
           2. Fraud Executors are individuals who attempt the 
       fraudulent funds transfer or payment. In the case of fraudulent 
       funds transfers, an account at the same financial organization 
       as that of the victim, or a different one, is opened, as the 
       destination account for the fraudulent transfer. Alternatively, 
       a fraudulent payment is made using a check or electronic 
       transfer.

                     Sharing Transaction Fraud Data     July 2008 
        
        
           3. Victims of both credential theft and transaction fraud. 
        
           4. Financial Organizations that hold the victim's and the 
       Fraud Executor's accounts. 
        
           5. Sensors at the Financial Organization that detect 
       fraudulent transaction attempts, either in real-time or after 
       the fact.  
        
       The intention of Thraud reporting is to enable any organization 
       that has detected fraud to share this information, either 
       internally or with other potential victim organizations. The 
       receiving organization can use this information, for example, to 
       institute manual review of transactions initiated from 
       suspicious IP addresses.  
        
       4.           IODEF-Document Incident Class 
        
       A Thraud Report SHALL be an instance of the IODEF-Document 
       class, as defined in [RFC5070]. The report SHALL contain at 
       least one Incident object, as defined in [RFC5070]. Each 
       Incident object SHOULD contain information about a single fraud 
       strategy. One Incident object MAY contain information about 
       multiple fraudulent transactions that are consistent with the 
       same fraud strategy. Each fraudulent transaction SHALL be 
       described in a separate EventData object. The data model for the 
       Incident class is defined in [RFC5070] and is repeated here, as 
       Figure 2, for the reader's convenience.

       The AdditionalData abstract class is an extension point in the 
       schema of the EventData class. Implementers SHALL include 
       exactly one of the following objects in AddtionalData: 
       FraudEventPayment, FraudEventTransfer, FraudEventIdentity and 
       FraudEventOther. Collectively, these are known as Thraud 
       Records. The corresponding classes are defined by this 
       specification in section 5, below. 
        
       The Thraud profile of the Incident class is defined in sections

       The FraudEventPaymentType class is used to report payee 
       instructions for a fraudulent payment or fraudulent payment 
       attempt. Fraudsters sometimes use the same payee instructions 
       (including the amount) for multiple fraudulent payment attempts. 
       By reporting the payment instructions used in the fraud, other 
       oragnizations may be able to detect similar fraudulent payment 
       attempts to the same payee.

       The FraudEventTransferType class is used to report the payee 
       instructions for a fraudulent funds transfer or fraudulent funds 
       transfer attempt. Fraudsters sometimes use the same payee 
       instructions (including the amount) for multiple fraudulent 
       funds transfer attempts. By reporting the funds transfer 
       instructions used in the fraud, other organizations may be able

       International Bank Account Number in the 'electronic form' (i.e. 
       containing no spaces) that is assigned to the account, as 
       administered by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial 
       Telecommunication (SWIFT).  The corresponding BankId xs:string 
       value SHOULD be set to the null string.  Receiving organizations

       Note that a single organization may be identified by more than 
       one value for any one or more of these namespaces. So, receiving 
       organizations SHOULD take this into account in their matching 
       procedure. 
        
       5.2.2.               AccountID 
        
       Zero or one value of type xs:string. The destination primary

       identified in the BankId element.  In the case where the BankId 
       namespace attribute value is 'iso13616_1_2007', this element 
       SHALL contain the International Bank Account Number in the 
       'electronic form' (i.e. containing no spaces) that is assigned 
       to the account.  In all other cases, the element SHALL contain 
       only the account number, as administered by the financial 
       organization that holds the account. The reporting organization 
       SHALL remove all prefixes that identify the country, bank or 
       branch.

       5.3.             FraudEventIdentityType Class 
        
       The FraudEventIdentityType class is used to report a fraudulent 
       impersonation or fraudulent impersonation attempt. By reporting 
       the impersonation event, other potential victims may be able to 
       detect similar fraudulent impersonation attempts.

       One or more values of type iodef:ExtensionType. This 
       specification defines two extensions: EmailAddress and UserID. 
        
       5.3.1.1.                 EmailAddress 
        
       In reporting an identity fraud event, the reporting institution 
       MAY include the victim's email address. This SHALL be achieved 
       by placing an object of type iodef:Email in the 
       IdentityComponent object. It SHALL contain the email address of 
       the intended fraud victim. 
        
       The IdentityComponent.dtype attribute SHALL be set to the value 
       "string". 
        
       The IdentityComponent.meaning attribute SHALL be set to the 
       value "victim email address".  
        
       5.3.1.2.                 UserID 
        
       In reporting an identity fraud event, the reporting institution 
       MAY include the victim's user id. This SHALL be achieved by 
       placing an object of type iodef:ExtensionType in the 
       IdentityComponent object. The data type of the extension

       5.4.             FraudEventOtherType Class 
        
       The FraudEventOtherType class SHALL be used to report fraudulent 
       events other than those detailed above, such as new event types 
       that may emerge at some time in the future. This class enables 
       such events to be reported, using this specification, even 
       though the specific characteristics of such events have not yet 
       been formally identified. By reporting the details of these 
       unspecified event types, other institutions may be able to 
       detect similar fraudulent activity.

       6.           IODEF Profile for an Activity Thraud Report 
        
       This section describes the profile of the IODEF Incident class 
       for a compliant Activity Thraud Report. 
        
       6.1.             Mandatory components 
        
       A Thraud Report SHALL conform to the data model specified for an 
       IODEF-Document in [RFC5070].  The following components of that 
       data model, while optional in IODEF, are REQUIRED in a 
       conformant Thraud Report. 
        
       Receiving organizations MAY reject documents that do not contain 
       all these components.  Therefore, reporting organizations MUST 
       populate them all. 
        
       Except where noted, these components SHALL be interpreted as 
       described in [RFC5070]. 
        
       Incident.Contact.ContactName - The name of the reporting 
       organization. In case the reporting organization acts as a 
       consolidator of reports from other organizations, elements of 
       this class SHALL contain the name of the consolidator. 
       Incident.Contact.Email - An email address at which the reporting 
       organization may be contacted. 
       Incident.Contact.Telephone 
       Incident.EventData 
       Incident.EventData.AdditionalData - SHALL contain exactly one 
       Thraud Record. 
        
       6.2.             Recommended Components 
        
       Receiving organizations SHOULD be capable of processing the 
       following components.  However, they MUST NOT reject documents 
       either because they are present or absent.

                     Sharing Transaction Fraud Data     July 2008 
        
       If available, reporting organizations SHOULD include these 
       components in Thraud Reports.  Except where noted, these 
       components SHALL be interpreted as described in [RFC5070]. 
        
       Incident.Contact.Contact 
       Incident.Contact.Contact.ContactName - The name of the reporting 
       fraud analyst. 
       Incident.Contact.Contact.Email - The email address of the 
       reporting fraud analyst. 
       Incident.Contact.Contact.Telephone - The telephone number of the 
       reporting fraud analyst.

       This profile provides no guidance to receiving organizations on 
       the proper processing of the following components. Therefore, 
       the reporting organization has no assurance that the receiving 
       organization will handle them in an appropriate manner and 
       SHOULD NOT include them in a Thraud Report.  However, receiving 
       organizations MUST NOT reject reports that do contain these 
       components.

       7.           IODEF profile for a Signature Thraud Report 
        
       A Signature Thraud Report SHALL convey information about the 
       behavior associated with fraudulent events, rather than 
       reporting the details of the specific events themselves. 
        
       Sharing Signature Thraud Reports helps receiving organizations 
       to detect suspicious behavior in their own systems. 
        
       A Signature Thraud Report SHALL conform to the profile described 
       in section 6.

       8.1.             Purpose Attribute 
        
       The following additional values are defined for the 
       Incident.purpose attribute. 
        
       Add - The enclosed Thraud Record values SHOULD be added to the 
       corpus by the receiving organization. 
        
       Delete - The enclosed Thraud Record types SHOULD be deleted from 
       the corpus by the receiving organization. 
        
       Modify - The enclosed Thraud Record values SHOULD replace the 
       corresponding values in the corpus. Where no corresponding types 
       currently exist in the corpus, the enclosed values SHOULD be 
       added to the corpus by the receiving organization. 
        
       9.           Security considerations 
        
       This document describes a document format for exchanging 
       information about successful or attempted transaction and 
       authentication fraud incidents.  The information is intended to 
       be used to improve the effectiveness of participants' fraud 
       detection and prevention programs.  The effectiveness of such 
       programs depends critically on the accuracy, reliability, 
       confidentiality and timeliness of both the information and the 
       participants in its exchange.  Threats to accuracy, reliability 
       and confidentiality include (but are not limited to) those 
       described here. 
        
       Fraudsters may attempt to introduce reports that delete or 
       modify incident information in the corpus.  Therefore, origin 
       authentication MUST be employed.  Human review SHOULD be 
       performed prior to implementing modifications to the corpus. 
        
       Fraudsters may attempt to interrupt or redirect submissions, 
       thereby preventing the sharing of intelligence concerning their 
       fraud strategies.  Therefore, authenticated receipts SHOULD be 
       employed. 
        
       Fraudsters may attempt to impersonate legitimate submitters, 
       thereby poisoning their reputations, and rendering ineffective 
       their future submissions.  Origin authentication MUST be used to 
       ensure that the sources of reports are properly identified. 
        
       Fraudsters that can view incident reports may adapt their fraud 
       strategies to avoid detection.  Therefore, reports MUST be 
       protected by confidentiality services including transport 
       encryption and access control. 
        
       M'RAIHI            Expires - January 2009             [Page 18] 
        
        
                     Sharing Transaction Fraud Data     July 2008 
        
        
       In order to prevent inadvertent disclosure of incident data, 
       incident reports SHOULD be encrypted while in storage. 
        
       The submitter of an incident report may incorrectly identify 
       legitimate activity as a fraud incident.  This may lead to 
       denial of service by a receiving organization that relies on the 
       report or information derived from the report.  Receiving 
       organizations SHOULD operate a reputation service, in which the 
       reliability of the information from particular sources is 
       assessed and tracked and subsequent reports are weighted 
       accordingly.  The source of reports MUST be authenticated.  
       Receiving organizations SHOULD use reports to step-up 
       authentication assurance, rather than simply denying service. 
        
       A receiving organization may misuse a Thraud report to deny 
       service, resulting in a loss for a legitimate user.  If such a 
       user were to learn the identity of the source of the information 
       that led to the denial of service, then that source may become 
       implicated in any resulting claim for compensation.  This, in 
       turn, may discourage reporting organizations from participating 
       in intelligence sharing.  Therefore, original sources SHOULD NOT 
       be identified in consolidated reports. 
        
       Any origin authentication and data integrity mechanism that is 
       acceptable to both parties MAY be used. 
        
       Any transport confidentiality mechanism that is acceptable to 
       both parties MAY be used. 
        
       This specification does not include a data compression 
       technique.  Therefore, it does not introduce any denial of 
       service vulnerabilities related to decompression. 
        
       10.            IANA considerations 
        
       This specification proposes the registration of two identifiers: 
        
        - The media sub-type name 'thraud+xml' in the standard 
       registration tree. 
        
        - The xml namespace identifier - urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:thraud-
       1.0. 
        
       10.1.              Media sub-type 
        
       Type name: application 
        
       Subtype name: thraud+xml

       application/xml as specified in [RFC3023]. 
        
       Encoding considerations: same as encoding considerations of 
       application/xml as specified in [RFC3023]. 
        
       Security considerations: this registration has all of the 
       security considerations described in [RFC3023] in addition to 
       those in section 9, above. 
        
       Interoperability considerations: this registration has all of 
       the interoperability considerations described in [RFC3023]. 
        
       Published specification: the media type data format is defined 
       in this specification. 
        
       Applications that use this media type: transaction and 
       authentication fraud analysis and reporting applications and 
       risk-based transaction and authentication evaluation 
       applications. 
        
       Additional information 
            Magic number(s): none

       10.2.              XML namespace 
        
       IANA is requested to register the xml namespace identifier: 
       urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:thraud-1.0. 
        
       11.            Conclusion 
        
       This specification introduces transaction fraud (Thraud) 
       reporting document structure that enable the sharing of fraud 
       data. Based on the IODEF-Document format, the proposed extension 
       facilitates interoperability to increase the security of online 
       applications.
