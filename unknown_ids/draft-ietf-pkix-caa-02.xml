                The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record allows a
                DNS domain name holder to specify the certificate signing certificate(s)

                CAA resource records allow a public Certification Authority to implement additional

            <t>
                The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record allows a
                DNS domain name holder to specify the Certification Authorities authorized 
                to issue certificates for that domain. Publication of CAA resource records 
                allow a public Certification Authority (CA) to implement additional
                controls to reduce the risk of unintended certificate mis-issue.
            </t>
            <t>
                Conformance with a published CAA record is a necessary but not sufficient
                condition for issue of a certificate.
                Before issuing a certificate, a PKIX CA is required to validate the 
                request according to the policies set out in its Certificate Policy 
                Statement. In the case of a public CA that validates certificate requests
                as a third party, the certificate will be typically issued under 
                a public root certificate embedded in one or more relevant Relying Applications.
            </t>
            <t>
                Criteria for inclusion of embedded root certificates in applications 
                are outside the scope of this document but typically require the CA to publish a 
                Certificate Practices Statement (CPS) that specifies how the requirements
                of the Certificate Policy (CP) are achieved and provide an annual
                audit statement of their performance against their CPS performed by
                an independent third party auditor.
            </t>
            <t>
                It is the intention of the authors to propose the CAA record defined
                in this document as the basis for CA validation requirements to be
                proposed in organizations that publish validation requirements. 
            </t>
            <t>
                CAA records only describe the current state of Certification Authority
                certificate issue authority. Since a certificate is typically valid 
                for at least a year, it is possible that a certificate that is not
                conformant with the CAA records currently published was conformant
                with the CAA records published at the time that it was issued. Thus 
                Relying Applications MUST NOT use failure to conform to currently 
                published CAA records specifying issue authorization as a certificate
                validity criteria.

                    A CAA RR publishes a CAA property entry that corresponds to the 
                    specified domain name. Multiple property entries MAY be associated 
                    with the same domain name by publishing multiple CAA RRs at that 
                    domain name. Each property 
                    entry MAY be tagged with one or more of the following flag values:

                      critical. The example.net CA is not authorized to
                      issue under either policy unless the processing rules for the

                    Since the validity of an end entity certificate is typically a 
                    year or more it is quite possible that the CAA records published
                    at a domain will change between the issue of the certificate and 
                    verification by a relying party.

            <t>
            While a Certification Authority can choose to ignore published CAA 
            records, doing so increases the both the probability that they will 
            mis-issue a certificate and the consequences of doing so. Once it is
            known that a CA observes CAA records, malicious registration requests 
            will  disproportionately target the negligent CAs that do not,
            and so the mis-issue rate amongst the negligent CAs will increase.
            Since the CA could clearly have avoided the mis-issue by performing
            CAA processing, the likelihood of sanctions against the negligent CA
            is increased. Failure to observe CAA issue restrictions provides an
            objective criteria for excluding issuers from embedded roots of trust.

            <t>
            In contrast, a Certification Authority that processes CAA records
            correctly can reasonably claim that any residual 
            mis-issue event could have been avoided had the Domain Name holder
            published appropriate CAA records.

                    Domain name holders SHOULD ensure that the CAs they authorize to issue

                        the consequences of a spoofing or suppression attack are much
                        greater for Certification Authorities and so additional countermeasures

                    A CA MUST mitigate this risk by employing DNSSEC verification whenever
