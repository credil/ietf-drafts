Abstract

   When requesting and reporting dialog status in SIP, users often want
   to know the status of a particular telephone instrument, rather than
   the status of an Address of Record (AOR).  The architecture of SIP
   makes it difficult to obtain the status of a telephone instrument in
   a way that is convenient for use in common situations, in particular,
   in an organization's PBX.  This document describes a method for
   identifying which telephone instrument is making each registration
   request that is convenient to deploy in PBXs.  This information can
   be used to obtain the status of individual telephone instruments.

   Unfortunately, although the method works well in practice, it
   violates separation of concerns by carrying instrument identification
   information in an authentication-related field.  This draft includes
   a preliminary discussion of better ways to identify instruments.

Internet-Draft        SIP Instrument Identification         October 2009


1.  Method

   When requesting and reporting dialog status in SIP[sip][dialog],
   users often want to know the status of a particular telephone
   instrument (which may have several "line appearances" of various
   Addresses of Record (AORs)), rather than the status of an Address of
   Record (AOR) (which may appear on several telephone instruments).
   ("Telephone instrument", or briefly, "instrument" is the term used
   for individual telephone devices in the telecom world.  We adopt it
   here to avoid the multiple meanings of the words "telephone" and
   "phone".)  The architecture of SIP makes it difficult to obtain the
   status of a telephone instrument in a way that is convenient for use
   in common situations, in particular, in an organization's PBX.

   This document describes a method by which a SIP registrar can
   identify which telephone instrument is making each registration
   request, a method that is convenient to deploy in PBXs.  This
   information can be used by a proxy to route requests to specified
   instruments.  This allows suitable SUBSCRIBE requests to be
   redirected to particular instruments, allowing the status of an
   instrument (as opposed to an AOR) to be obtained.

   The fundamental difficulty is identifying the instrument which is the
   source of each REGISTER request.  There are a number of
   straightforward methods of identifying the registering instrument,
   all of which have significant drawbacks:

   IP address:  The IP address from which the request originated (as
      given by the Contact header, the Via header, or the packet's
      origin address) cannot be relied upon to be the true address of
      the instrument due to NAT or application-level gateway processing.
      In addition, the IP address of an instrument can change due to
      network address reassignment or relocation of the instrument on
      the network.

   MAC address:  The MAC address of the instrument's network interface
      will not change over time, but it is impossible to obtain if the
      instrument is not on the same network segment as the registrar.

   'instance' parameter value in the Contact:  The 'instance' parameter
      value in the Contact is easily obtainable and does not change with
      network modifications.  However, not all instruments provide an
      'instance' parameter.  Also, an instrument may change its instance
      value when its software is updated, so as to invalidate
      information about the instrument that is cached by other elements,
      as exemplified by this guideline in [gruu-implement]:

         As other SIP agents may use the instance ID and/or GRUU as a
         key to cache information about the UA and its capabilities, it
         is recommended that when a new version of software is installed
         into the UA, the UA should obtain a new instance ID.

      We have also observed that some instruments use different instance
      parameter values for different line appearances.  In addition,
      instance parameter values are usually UUID-based URNs, which are
      tedious for system administrators to enter into a provisioning
      system.

   URI parameters:  URI parameters could be applied to the AORs of the
      line appearances on the instrument.  But URI parameters are not
      configurable on some popular instruments.

   user-part URI parameters:  An alternative to URI parameters is the
      nonstandardized concept of "user-part parameters", that is
      suffixing ";name=value" on the user-part of the AOR.  (User-part
      parameters are not described in [sip], but since ';' and '=' are
      syntactically allowed in user-parts, they are a semantic extension
      to [sip].)  Since instruments allow the user-part of the AOR to be
      configured, user-part parameters can always be added.
      Unfortunately, some intermediate network elements modify or delete
      user-part parameters.  In addition, most instruments display the
      entire SIP user-part to the user.

   SIP extensions:  It would be simple enough to have instruments
      provide a suitable identifier in an extension header, but it would
      be difficult to persuade vendors to implement the extension.

   The method described in this document depends on the fact that in a
   practical PBX, the PBX's provisioning system generates configuration
   files which are read by the instruments to set up their SIP
   configuration.  The PBX provisioning system inserts into the
   configuration file of each instrument an identifier of the
   instrument, which the instrument then returns in its REGISTER
   requests.  This allows the registrar to correlate the instrument with
   the configuration file that it loaded, and hence with the identity of
   the instrument as understood by the PBX provisioning system.

   In practice, each instrument uses its MAC address to obtain a unique
   configuration file using a network data transfer protocol (e.g.,
   HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or TFTP) requesting a file name that is derived
   from the instrument's MAC address.  This makes it convenient to
   choose a string representation of an instrument's MAC address as the
   unique identifier of that instrument.  For syntactic convenience, we
   omit the colons from the string representation, and require each
   identifier to have a consistent case.

   It is challenging to determine a way to embed the instrument
   identifier in a instrument's configuration in a way that will
   guarantee that it is returned in each REGISTER request without the
   instrument's specific cooperation.  It appears that in practice, the
   sole datum that is handled opaquely from the instrument's
   configuration file, through the instrument and the network, to the
   registrar, is the "authentication user", the value of the username
   field of the Authorization or Proxy-Authorization header.  Hence, we
   insert the instrument identification by configuring the
   authentication user as "real-user/instrument-identifier".  (Because
   the instrument identifier does not contain '/', parsing is unique
   even if the real authentication user contains '/'.)

2.  Using Instrument Identifiction

   Once we have arranged for each REGISTER to carry identification of
   the instrument that sent it, the registrar can record the
   identification in the database record of the registration.  This
   allows us to define a special set of URIs which designate the
   collection of all contacts registered by a given instrument.  In
   principle, this is similar to the redirection of AORs, which are
   mapped into the set of all contacts for a particular AOR, but instead
   selecting records from the registration database based on the
   instrument identification datum rather than the user datum..

   A further elaboration is to define another special set of URIs which
   designate the collection of all contacts for a given AOR that are
   also registered by a given instrument.  This will usually select only
   one registration, for a single line appearance.

   preferred method.

   Instrument 0000DEADBEEF receives its configuration file.

   F4 REGISTER Instrument -> PBX Proxy/Registrar

   The instrument sends a REGISTER request for AOR sip:69@example.net to
   the proxy/registrar.  After a 407 authentication challenge, the re-
   sent REGISTER request contains a Proxy-Authorization header whose
   username value is as specified in the instrument's configuration
   file, "69/0000DEADBEEF".  The first portion, "69", is used by the
   proxy/registrar to look up the associated password.  The second
   portion, "0000DEADBEEF", is stored in the registration record to
   identify the instrument whose contact address has been registered.

   F6 REGISTER Instrument -> PBX Proxy/Registrar

   Similarly, the instrument sends a REGISTER request for AOR
   sip:70@example.net to the proxy/registrar.

   F8 SUBSCRIBE sip:~~in~0000DEADBEEF@example.net

   User agent 71 sends a SUBSCRIBE request to
   sip:~~in~0000DEADBEEF@example.net to obtain dialog information for
   instrument 0000DEADBEEF.  The user-part prefix shown here, "~~in~",
   is the one used in the sipXecs open-source PBX system[sipXecs].  This
   particularly ugly string is chosen to minimize the likelihood of
   colliding with user-chosen user-parts.

   F9 SUBSCRIBE sip:69@10.3.14.159
   F11 SUBSCRIBE sip:70@10.3.14.159

   The SUBSCRIBE request is forked to the two contacts for
   sip:~~in~0000DEADBEEF@example.net, which are the two line appearances
   on the instrument 0000DEADBEEF.

   F14 NOTIFY sip:10.9.8.7 / From: sip:69@10.3.14.159
   F16 NOTIFY sip:10.9.8.7 / From: sip:70@10.3.14.159

   Each SUBSCRIBE request received at instrument 0000DEADBEEF generates
   a subscription.  The NOTIFYs from these subscriptions tell user agent
   71 the complete status of instrument 0000DEADBEEF.

4.  Interoperability

   This method makes very limited demands on components of a SIP system
   other than the PBX's provisioning system and proxy/registrar because
   the authentication user name is passed transparently by elements
   between the instrument and the proxy/registrar.

   This method does require that the configuration file for an
   instrument can set the authentication user for a line appearance
   independently of the user name of the AOR to be registered.  This has
   been found to be possible on all models of SIP phone that have been
   tested to date.  Industry intelligence is that some popular SIP
   provisioning systems require that this be possible, which suggests
   that all commercially successful SIP phones will have this
   capability.

   This method was implemented in the sipXecs open-source PBX
   system[sipXecs] and tested at SIPit 25[sipit] using five makes of SIP
   phone.  It was seen to work with all five makes.

5.  Future Improvements

   As well as this method works, it is a hack that violates separation
   of concerns because instrument identification information is carried
   in a field which is intended for authentication information.  This
   requires all elements that need to authenticate the source of a
   request to understand the syntax of the authentication user name.
   This burden is smaller for centralized systems, but in decentralized
   systems, there may be a large number of elements that need to
   authenticate requests, requiring a broad distribution of information
   that in principle should be encapsulated in the "user name and
   password" database.

   The philosophically ideal way to identify instruments is via the SIP
   "instance id".  The instance id is used to support the "SIP outbound"
   mechanism[outbound], the GRUU mechanism[gruu], and the SIP Forum's UA
   configuration system[ua-config].

   There are two distinct ways to use the SIP instance id to support
   instrument identification:

   1.  The instance id is carried in the "+sip.instance" field parameter
       of each Contact in each REGISTER request.  The proxy/registrar
       can extract the instance id and use it to label each registration
       database record.  Once the registrations are labelled with
       instrument identifications, requests can be directed to special
       URIs that route to the registered contacts of a specific
       instrument.

   2.  Each instrument can register a single special contact which is
       intended to identify the instrument as a whole rather than any
       line appearance on the instrument.  This contact can be
       recognized by containing the instance id as either a component of
       the contact URI or as a "+sip.instance" field parameter.  With
       this method, the functions described in this document are be
       implemented by sending SIP requests to this special contact.
       E.g., the overall dialog status of the instrument would be
       obtained by a dialog subscription to the special contact.

   A number of problems need to be overcome before the instance id can
   be used to provide instrument identification:

   1.  While the authentication user name is a baseline part of SIP and
       is always configurable by a PBX's provisioning system, the SIP
       instance id is not part of baseline SIP, and user agents need to
       be upgraded to support the SIP instance id.  In practice, only
       some makes of instrument support SIP instance ids.

   2.  Ideally, all line appearances on an instrument would use the same
       instance id.  Whether this is required by the RFCs is not
       entirely clear (probably because there has never been any reason
       to debate doing so).  In practice, some instruments do use
       different instance ids for each line appearance that they
       register.  However, since the preferred format of instance ids is
       a URN derived from a UUID, which is in turn based on the MAC
       address of the instrument, it is straightforward to extract the
       instrument's MAC address from each instance id, and the extracted
       MAC addresses of the various line appearances will be the same.

   3.  The PBX's provisioning system needs to be able to map instance
       ids into its internal instrument identities, which likely
       requires having the user enter the instrument identifiers into
       the provisioning system.  It would be inconvenient to use full
       instance id URNs for this reason: UUID-based URNs are quite long
       and tedious to type.  However, using the base MAC addresses of
       the URNs as the instrument identifiers would be convenient, as
       they are short enough to be convenient to enter and most SIP
       phones are clearly labeled with their MAC address

   4.  The reverse problem can happen with software-based instruments:
       The provisioning system needs to output an instrument identifier
       which can be input into the instrument, as the network interface
       of the hardware platform is not "owned" by the instrument, and
       the instrument may not be the only one on the platform.  In the
       method of this document, doing so is relatively simple, since the
       instrument's interface allows the authentication user name to be
       entered directly by the user.  To utilize the instance id, the
       instrument needs to allow its instance id to be configured, or
       else it needs to output its instance id so that it can be entered
       into the provisioning system.

6.  Security Considerations

   There is one known security consideration for this method: In
   ordinary usage of digest authentication, the registrar (and any other
   element that needs to verify an Authorization or Proxy-Authorization
   header) does not need to know the password associated with an
   authentication user, but only needs to know the digest authentication
   A1 value, which is a hash of the authentication user, the
   authentication password, and the authentication realm.[digest] With
   this method, the registrar must know the authentication password, as
   the A1 value will depend on the authentication user in the request,
   which varies depending on the instrument sending the request.

   This increased exposure of the authentication password does not
   increase the vulnerability of a single SIP system, since disclosure
   of A1 also allows an attacker to impersonate the authentication user
   on that system.  But exposure of the authentication password (as
   opposed to the A1 value) also compromises the authentication user on
   any other SIP system which the attacker can identify as using the
   same authentication password for that authentication user.

   In practice, this does not seem to be a problem as the authentication
   passwords are usually generated pseudorandomly by the PBX
   provisioning system and communicated to the instruments through their
   configuration files.  As a result, authentication users on different
   systems will have different authentication passwords, so the
   compromise of the authentication user's password on one system will
   not compromise the authentication user on other systems.
