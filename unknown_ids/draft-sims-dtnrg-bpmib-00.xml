          <t>The Bundle Protocol (BP) [RFC5050] was designed as part of the
          solution to issues encountered in Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN)
          environments [RFC4838], which are otherwise unresolvable by the
          connection-oriented scheme used in today's Internet.  This memo
          contains the definitions for a Bundle Protocol MIB as well as
          rationale for certain implementation decisions.  Also contained in
          this memo is a section dedicated to considerations for future
          designers of DTN-related MIBs.  The MIB module defined in this memo
          contains object definitions for a single Node, for each Endpoints 
          of which that Node is a member, and for the CLAs which that
          Node has access to use.</t>

            <section title="Structure of the MIB">
              <t>Objects within the BP-MIB have been derived from RFC 5050 [RFC5050] or 
              were designed to be used in the management of a BP Node, but
              are not explicitly derived from RFC 5050 [RFC5050].  These
              objects are broken down into three main groups:

                other words, these objects do not relate to a Node's relationship
                with any other entity (i.e.  Endpoints and CLAs).  Node-Specific

                by these objects are subject only to the Node's view of the Endpoint
                (e.g. the current state of the Endpoint is "active" according to this
                Node OR the number of Bundles this Node has received through this

            <section anchor="designDecisions" title="Design Decisions">
              <t>This section contains information regarding certain design choices
              made during the creation of the BP-MIB module.  Each decision was
              made keeping in mind certain assumptions regarding the circumstances
              under which a DTN might commonly operate.  These assumptions include:

              <list style="symbols">
                <t>Low-powered equipment is likely to be used</t>
                <t>Limitations on long-term and (possibly) short-term storage are
                   likely to exist and</t>
                <t>Delayed communication might require dissimilar management techniques
                   from those used in timely environments</t>
              </list>
              </t>

              <section anchor="nodeEndpointDesign" title="Node and Endpoint Representation">
                <t>The first design decision involved the overall representation of
                Nodes and their respective attributes.  According to section 3.1 of
                RFC 5050 [RFC5050], Nodes have a M:N relationship with Endpoints.
                That is to say, a Node can be a member of multiple Endpoints and (as
                long as it is not a Singleton Endpoint) an Endpoint can have multiple
                Nodes register it.  Since SMIv2 [RFC2578] does not allow for the
                creation of three-dimensional conceptual tables, a normalized view of
                this relationship would require a mediating table or a method of
                simulating a three-dimensional conceptual table.  The method used here, 
                as exhibited in section 5 of this document, was to simulate a 
                three-dimensional conceptual table by having each instance of the BP-MIB   
                contain managed information for a single Node - with each instance 
                having a conceptual table that contains managed information for each 
                Endpoint of which the Node is a member.</t>
              </section>

              <section anchor="claDesign" title="Convergence Layer Adapters">
                <t>With the Node/Endpoint decision made, the next decision involved the
                representation of CLAs.  Since multiple Nodes can share the use of
                CLAs, and since the characteristics of a CLA are implementation
                dependent, few objects were placed within the bpClaTable.  Since it
                is likely that a CLA's managed objects (those stored in a MIB 
                designed specifically for the management of the given CLA type) 
                will maintain more specific information than that contained in the 
                bpClaTable, two objects were created as a way to reference a CLA's
                MIB instance.  These two objects are:

                <list style="symbols">
                  <t>bpClType - Identifies the type of Convergence Layer (CL) being
                     used by the CLA (e.g.  UDP, TCP, LTP, or otherwise)</t>
                  <t>bpClID - Uniquely identifies the instance of managed information
                     for the underlying CL whose type is defined by bpClType</t>
                </list>
                </t>
    
                <t>The bpClType and bpClId objects are also used as a solution to a specific 
                design goal.  This goal involves the ability to trace managed
                information down the protocol stack and is discussed in more 
                detail in section 4.2.3 of this document.</t>
              </section>

              <section anchor="stackDesign" title="Managing the Protocol Stack">
                <t>One of this MIB's primary goals is to enable managed information 
                to be traceable throughout the protocol stack.  Ultimately, this goal is 
                achieved by creating either a direct or indirect reference to an entry in the 
                ifTable [RFC2863].  To make this possible, the BP-MIB MUST have identifier(s) 
                that can be used to reference the MIB instance of the layer beneath itself. The 
                BP-MIB is designed in such a way that both direct and indirect references to an 
                ifTable entry can be achieved. This was done by placing two objects within the 
                bpClaTable: one that uniquely identifies the CL type (bpClType) and one that 
                uniquely identifies an instance of managed information for the given type 
                (bpClID). Direct references to an ifTable entry are achieved by setting 
                bpClType = 1 (which means it is referring to an interface). Indirect references 
                are achieved when referencing a CLA MIB which, in turn, references the layer 
                beneath itself.</t>   
                     
                <t>bpClType SHOULD be a standardized numeric value that identifies the
                type of Convergence Layer being used by the Convergence Layer
                Adapter.  This object is discussed more in section 4.2.4 of this
                document; giving rationale to the need for number standardization.</t>

                <t>bpClID, alternatively, is an arbitrary value chosen by the agent that 
                uniquely identifies an instance of the MIB whose type is given by
                bpClType.  The NMS responsible for the managed information can use
                this value to determine the OID of the desired CLA.</t>    

                <t>Currently, the MIB module defines the bpClType object to be an integer.  This 
                design decision needs reconsideration however.  For readability and ease of 
                use, a textual-convention would likely be a better choice for the object syntax.</t>   
 
                <t>There are two objects in the bpClaTable that represent the number of
                Bundles passed into the BPA and out through the underlying CL 
                (bpClInBndls and bpClOutBndls).  Though these values are not used for
                stack traversal, they are maintained as a way of offering a view of 
                Bundle activity to/from the BP layer for each CLA.</t>
              </section>
    
              <section anchor="bpClTypeDesign" title="bpClType Number Standardization">
                <t>In sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 of this document, the use of bpClType was
                discussed. Using such an object, however, could result in 
                inconsistencies across implementations of BP software.  To avoid this,
                the BP-MIB uses a pre-defined set of numeric values, each 
                uniquely representing a CL type.</t>
              </section>
    
              <section anchor="bpClaDirectionDesign" title="Reason for bpClaDirection">
                <t>The value in knowing the direction of data flow can be found in the
                use of certain equipment types.  Satellites, for instance, are
                prone to utilizing an up-link that is different from the down-link.
                Scenarios similar to this are likely to result in the creation of two
                separate CLA MIB instances - one for each link.  In these cases, a
                manager might desire knowing whether the underlying CL is capable of
                transmitting unidirectional traffic or bidirectional traffic.  To

                <t>In an attempt to keep things modular, TRAP and INFORM objects have
                been left out of the BP-MIB.  These objects SHOULD be designed in a

                with the BP-MIB.  Since the
                requirements of network management within a DTN are distinct from
                those in a timely environment, use of notifications might vary
                between DTN environments and timely environments.  With this in mind,

                <t>Certain MIBs, such as those that manage high performance equipment, 
                might contain mechanisms to store local data trends and simple 
                statistical analysis. Though DTNs aren't typically found in environments
                that require high-performance equipment,
                the need for such mechanisms might exist due to delay-related restraints.
                However, in an attempt to keep things modular, statistic-based objects and
                trending objects have been considered beyond the scope of the BP-MIB.
                These objects, if any such objects are designed, SHOULD be put in a 
                separate MIB module which MAY be implemented in conjunction with the 
                BP-MIB, but can function independent of the BP-MIB. Design considerations for

            <section anchor="considerations" title="Considerations for Future Designers">
              <t>This section is dedicated to describing certain considerations that future 
              designers of DTN-related MIBs SHOULD observe in the design process. Section 
              4.3.1 gives a generic overview of DTN-related network management concepts and how 
              they might apply to the design of DTN-related MIBs. Sections 4.3.2 through 4.3.4 
              observe particular MIB types and describe how they can and SHOULD inter-relate 
              with the BP-MIB.</t>

              <t>Though it's beyond the scope of this document to discuss DTN network 
              management requirements, certain DTN network management issues SHOULD be 
              considered in the design of DTN-related MIBs. For this reason, this section
              contains a brief discussions that might introduce potential road-blocks to
              future designers.</t>

              <section anchor="entityManagement" title="Delay/Disruption Entity Management">
                <t>DTN-related MIB designers SHOULD consider the environment(s) under which the
                MIB might be deployed. Environment, as used here, refers to elements like: the 
                storage capacity and processing power of the equipment being used; the frequency at which 
                values might change in relation to the frequency at which they can be transmitted 
                to an NMS; existing network management protocol capabilities and; whether best 
                practices in timely networks apply or if distinctions ought to be made. Additionally, 
                designers SHOULD consider the level of diversity that potential environments might 
                have from one another. Not doing so limits scalability and increases complexity for 
                future designers.</t>

                <t>In Delay / Disruption prone environments, high latency and periodic disconnection 
                are likely to occur. With this in mind, designers SHOULD use object types that reflect 
                an object's nature - in regard to how frequently that object might change (e.g. how 
                often a counter might roll back to 0). Designers SHOULD also consider that certain desirable 
                statistics or trends might be impossible to calculate in the same way they could be in 
                a timely environment. This might result in the need to calculate and store vsuch values
                on the managed entity. Careful consideration SHOULD be given before using a 
                MIB-based solution to this issue. Not doing so limits scalability and increases complexity 
                for future designers.</t>

              <section anchor="claMibs" title="CLA MIB Design">
                <t>As described in sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3, Convergence Layer Adapter MIBs will be 
                needed for the management of information beyond what is offered by bpClaTable.
                This section addresses the design of those MIBs and offers suggestions to the
                designers.</t>

                <t>Within the BP-MIB, the bpClaTable contains objects for each CLA the Node currently 
                has access to. Within this table, two objects were defined as a reference to the underlying
                CLA's managed objects. These objects (bpClType and bpClID) 
                were described in detail in sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3. This document RECOMMENDS that the 
                design of CLA MIBs follow a similar pattern in order to preserve the goal of managing the protocol 
                stack. To achieve this, two things MUST be done on the part of the designer. First, an 
                object whose value can be referenced by bpClID needs to be placed somewhere within the CLA's MIB.
                This object MUST be assigned an arbitrary, but unique, value for each instance of the object - 
                however, the maintenance of 
                uniqueness might be subject to software implementation rather than in the design of the MIB.
                Second, object(s) that can be used to reference the layer beneath the CLA need to be created.
                The exact method of doing this is beyond the scope of this document.</t>

              <section anchor="notificationMibs" title="Notification MIB Design">
                <t>Design of DTN-related TRAP and INFORM objects SHOULD take into account the environment(s) 
                under which they might be deployed.  The level of variance one environment's conditions have 
                to others' can be arbitrarily small or large. For instance, delay, in one
                environment, could refer to a relatively short time span, such as 5 minutes, whereas other 
                environments might consider delay as referring to days at a time. TRAP and INFORM objects
                SHOULD NOT be designed as a solution to a single environment if they could reasonably be
                designed to encompass multiple environments.</t>

                <t>Because of the introduction of delay into the management process, designers SHOULD consider
                what is valuable to a management station relative to when that station will receive a notification.
                Since DTN elements can be managed both locally and remotely, designers of notifications SHOULD consider 
                whether the notification can be used in a timely or delayed environment. To this same end, a 
                designer SHOULD consider the ways (if any) a notifications can be made to serve both purposes.</t>

              <section anchor="extensionBlockMibs" title="Extension Block MIB Design">
                <t>Extension blocks created for use with the Bundle Protocol are likely to contain characteristics
                not managed by the BP-MIB. However, the management of information regarding these characteristics
                SHOULD reference the Node by which the extension block was processed. There are two ways in which
                this MAY be done. First, a designer could reference the Node by its bpNodeID value. Second, since
                each Node is a member of at least one Singleton Endpoint, the Endpoint ID (EID) belonging to
                a Singleton of which the desired Node is a member can be used. This document however, RECOMMENDS use of 
                bpNodeID. Use of a Singleton's EID could fail in cases where a Node is a member of multiple Singleton 
                Endpoints. As long as one other Singleton exists for the Node, it can unregister a Singleton
                Endpoint. If the EID used to reference the Node belonged to the unregistered Singleton, a management stations would no
                longer be able to know which Node is related to the extension block information.</t>

    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module was designed for the management of Bundle 
        Protocol (BP) Nodes, for the Endpoints they are members of, 
        and for Node &lt;===&gt; CLA relationships. This MIB is structured 
        in a way that Node-Specific objects are arranged separately 
        from Endpoint and CLA -Specific objects. Objects which are 
        Endpoint or CLA -Specific are arranged in Conceptual Rows 
        within their own, respective, Conceptual Tables. Further, 
        each instance of this module's objects represents a single 
        managed Node. This means that a separate instantiation of 
        the BP-MIB's objects will be forged for each Node being 
        managed by the system. The layout of the MIB is arranged in 
        the following order:

        * Node-Specific Definitions
        * Endpoint-Specific Definitions
        * CLA-Specific Definitions
        * Conformance Requirements for the BP-MIB"

    DESCRIPTION
        "With the desire to avoid dependence on any specific 
        underlying protocols or protocol-suite, this value exists to
        specify the underlying CL (Convergence Layer) type being 
        used by this CLA (Convergence Layer Adapter). Each known CL 
        type will be associated to a unique integer value greater 
        than 0. Doing this will help to avoid implementation 
        inconsistencies.

        Each value herein uniquely represents a Convergence Layer 
        type and, likewise, can be used in conjunction with the 
        bpClID value to find managed information regarding an 
        instance of the appropriate CLA's MIB.

        Convergence Layer Values:
        Interface         1
        LTP               2
        UDP               3
        TCP               4
        IP                5
        DCCP              6

        NOTE: if this convention becomes accepted, these values 
        should probably make their way into a textual-convention 
        rather than being loosely defined in a description block!

          <t>Extensive thanks is given to Hans Kruse, Dovel Myers, Gilbert Clark,
          Josh Schendel, and the family of Ohio University's Internetworking Research 
          Group Laboratory for their contributions on the MIB's design and how it
          might inter-relate with other DTN-related MIBs.</t>

        <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
            <t>
                This section has work to be done. IANA considerations do
                include the standardization of the bpClType object and any
                Textual-Convention that is subsequently created for it.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
          <t>Though SNMPv3 is the current de facto standard of network
          management protocols, there is no guarantee that this will hold
          true in the DTN architecture. With this in mind, any protocols
          used should consider, to the fullest feasible extent, the security
          measures used in SNMPv3. Those protocols should also consider
          those security considerations specifically listed in the following
          paragraphs.</t>

          <t>There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
          a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. So, if this
          MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
          intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
          module via direct SNMP SET operations.</t>
        
          <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
          Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
          even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
          allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
          in this MIB module.</t>

          <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
          provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
          including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
          authentication and privacy).</t>

          <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
          RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
          enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
          responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
          instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
          the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
          rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>

It specifies clarifications to, and extensions of, the architectural issues within the MIB-II model of the 'interfaces' group. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>This document describes an architecture for delay-tolerant and disruption-tolerant networks, and is an evolution of the architecture originally designed for the Interplanetary Internet, a communication system envisioned to provide Internet-like services across interplanetary distances in support of deep space exploration.  This document describes an architecture that addresses a variety of problems with internetworks having operational and performance characteristics that make conventional (Internet-like) networking approaches either unworkable or impractical.  We define a message- oriented overlay that exists above the transport (or other) layers of the networks it interconnects.  The document presents a motivation for the architecture, an architectural overview, review of state management required for its operation, and a discussion of application design issues.  This document represents the consensus of the IRTF DTN research group and has been widely reviewed by that group.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the third version of the Internet-Standard Management Framework, termed the SNMP version 3 Framework (SNMPv3).  This Framework is derived from and builds upon both the original Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv1) and the second Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv2).  The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of the Framework over time.  The document explains why using SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is strongly recommended.  The document also recommends that RFCs 1157, 1441, 1901, 1909 and 1910 be retired by moving them to Historic status.  This document obsoletes RFC 2570.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract></front>
