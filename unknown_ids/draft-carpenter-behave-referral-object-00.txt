Abstract

   The purpose of a referral is to enable a given entity in a multiparty
   application to pass information to another party.  This memo
   specifies a Generic Referral Object (GRO) to be used in the context
   of referrals.  The proposed object is compact and is application-
   independent.  Both IPv4 and IPv6 schemes are supported, as well as
   upper layer identifiers.  Additional information to characterise an
   enclosed reference is also described.  To allow proper interpretation
   of referrals, a new notion of scope identifiers is introduced.

Internet-Draft           Generic Referral Object                May 2009


1.  Introduction and Motivation

   A frequently occurring situation is that one entity A connected to
   the Internet (or to some private network using the Internet protocol
   suite) needs to inform another entity B how to reach either A itself
   or some third-party entity C. This is known as a referral.

   In the original design of the Internet, IP addresses were global,
   unique, and quasi-permanent.  Also any differentiation beyond that
   provided by an IP address was done by protocol and port numbers.
   Referrals were therefore performed simply by passing an IP address
   and possibly protocol and port numbers.  In fact simple referrals
   (the first case above, sometimes called first-party referrals) were
   never needed since B could simply use A's address.  Third-party
   referrals were trivial: A would tell B about C's address.  Thus, it
   became common practice to pass raw addresses between entities.  A
   classical example is the FTP PORT command [RFC0959].

   Unfortunately, this simple approach to referrals often fails in
   today's Internet.  As has been known for some time [RFC2101],
   addresses no longer all have global scope, and may have limited
   lifetime.  Both addresses and port numbers may be different on either
   side of a NAT or some other middlebox [RFC3234], and firewalls may
   block them.  Also, the Internet now has two coexisting address
   formats for IPv4 and IPv6.  Sending an out-of-scope or expired
   address, or one of the wrong format, as a referral will fail.

   In some cases, this problem may be readily solved by passing a Fully
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) instead of an address.  Indeed, that is
   an architecturally preferred solution [RFC1958].  However, it is not
   sufficient in many cases of dynamic referrals.  Experience shows that
   an application cannot use a domain name in order to reliably find the
   address(es) of an arbitrary peer.  Domain names work fairly well to
   find the addresses of servers, as in web servers or SMTP servers,
   because operators of public servers take pains to make sure that
   their domain names work.  But DNS records are not as reliably
   maintained for arbitrary hosts such as might need to be contacted in
   peer-to-peer applications.  Many small networks do not even maintain
   DNS entries for their hosts, and for some networks that do list local
   hosts in DNS, the listings may well be unusable from a remote
   location (say because of two-faced DNS, or because the A record
   contains a private address).  Furthermore, an FQDN may not be
   sufficient to establish successful communications involving
   heterogeneous peers (i.e.  IPv4 and IPv6) since A and AAAA records
   may not be correctly provisioned.

   Another problem is that an application does not have a reliable way
   of knowing its own domain name - or to be more precise, a way of



Carpenter, et al.       Expires November 12, 2009               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           Generic Referral Object                May 2009


   knowing a domain name that will allow the application to be reached
   from another environment.

   For these reasons, the problem of address referrals cannot be solved
   just by recommending the use of FQDNs instead.

   The first motivation for this draft is the observation that unless
   the parties involved have reached an understanding about the scope,
   lifetime, and format of the elements in a referral through some other
   means, that information must be passed with the referral.  This is
   required so that the receiving entity can determine whether or not
   the referral is useful.

   When a referral fails, good design suggests that the receiving entity
   should attempt to correct the situation.  For example, if
   communication fails to be established using an IP address, it would
   often be appropriate to attempt a DNS lookup.  The second motivation
   for this draft is that it may be helpful to the entity receiving a
   referral to also receive information about the source of the
   referral, such as an FQDN, if that is known to the sender of the
   referral.  The receiving entity can then attempt to recover a valid
   address (and possibly port number) for the referred entity.

   It should be noted that partial or application-specific solutions to
   this problem abound.  A non-normative Appendix gives examples, in the
   form of use cases.  The objective of this specification is to define
   a generic and extensible solution, to allow more robust application
   design.  It is an open question whether existing applications will
   benefit from retro-fitting GROs, or whether they will mainly be of
   use for new applications.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:
   o  "Generic Referral Object (GRO)": the data object defined by this
      specification.
   o  "Entity": we use this rather than "application" to describe any
      software component embedded in a host, not just a specific
      application, that sends, receives or makes use of GROs.  Also, in
      case of dynamic load sharing or failover, an entity might even
      migrate between hosts.
   o  "Referral": the act of one entity informing another entity how to
      contact a specific entity.
   o  "Reference": the actual data (name, address, identitifier,
      locator, pointer, etc.) that is the basis of a referral.
   o  "Scope Identifier (ScopeID): an identifier for the scope of
      validity of a reference.

   o  "Qualifier": a data item that gives additional information about a
      Reference.
   o  "Referring entity": the entity that sends a referral.
   o  "Receiving entity": the entity that receives a referral.
   o  "Referenced entity": the entity described in a GRO.

1.2.  Normative Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Summary of Requirements

   A GRO should be self-describing; that is to say, even if it is
   forwarded several times across the network, the ultimate receiving
   entity should be able to extract and interpret all the information
   inserted by the original referring entity.

   A GRO should be compact (i.e., binary encoded) and designed for
   efficient processing.

   The GRO format must not be specific to a given IP version and must
   not be application-specific.

   A GRO should contain information that the referring entity can
   provide about the scope, lifetime, format and source of the referral,
   encoded in a universal format.

   The GRO format should be extensible with well-defined backwards
   compatibility.

   A damaged GRO would be useless.  However, to maintain efficiency,
   intrinsic error detection or correction for GROs should not be
   mandatory.  Therefore, GROs SHOULD be sent over a channel supporting
   error detection or correction.

   A forged GRO would be at least as dangerous as a forged IP address.
   However, to maintain efficiency, intrinsic cryptographic
   authentication of GROs should not be mandatory.  The use of an
   authenticated channel to transmit GROs is RECOMMENDED.

   An intercepted GRO would be at least as revelatory as an intercepted
   IP address.  However, to maintain efficiency, intrinsic encryption of
   GROs should not be mandatory.  The use of an encrypted channel to
   transmit GROs is RECOMMENDED.

3.  Referral Semantics and Scope Identifiers

   The principal purpose of a referral is to enable one entity in a
   multi-party application to pass information to another party involved
   in the same application.  This specification makes no assumptions
   about whether the entities are acting as clients, servers, peers,
   super-nodes, relays, proxies, etc., as far as the application is
   concerned.  Neither does it take a position as to how the various
   entities become aware of the need to send a referral; this depends
   entirely on the structure of the application.

   It is the responsibility of the referring entity to construct a GRO
   on the basis of information in its possession.  It is the
   responsibility of the receiving entity to interpret and check this
   information.  Due to the fluidity of connectivity in today's
   Internet, the referring entity cannot guarantee that the referenced
   entity can be reached.  This can only be checked by the receiving
   entity.  In the event of a reachability problem, information in the
   GRO may assist the receiving entity to find an alternative path.

   Since the most fundamental quantity likely to be conveyed in a GRO is
   an IP address, (and possibly a port number) its scope is a key
   question.  Address scope is not a simple concept, as shown by the
   discussion in [RFC4007] and the practical difficulties caused by
   [RFC3484].  Even the concept of link-local scope is complicated by
   the existence of multi-link subnets [RFC4903].  For the purpose of
   referrals, it seems that previous formalisations of the concept of
   scope are inadequate.  Assuming that a GRO is trustworthy, one
   question that a receiving entity must answer is: can the address in
   this GRO be reached from here?  That question is not answered by
   knowing only the scope (in the sense of RFC4007) as defined at the
   location of the referring entity.  For that reason, scope is
   represented in a new way in GROs.  Firstly, the scope is qualified
   (to the best of the referring entity's knowledge) as follows:
   o  Null.  The address is known not to be applicable outside the
      referring host (e.g., a loopback address).  This option is
      provided mainly for completeness.  There is no value in such a
      GRO, and for privacy reasons it should not be communicated anyway.
   o  Link.  Apart from the standard Ethernet-like view of link
      locality, this scope would also apply to point-to-point links and
      to fragments of a multi-link subnet.  Although on-link referrals
      should be trivial, this case is included to allow for uniform
      design of applications utilising GROs, so that link-local does not
      become a special case.
   o  Limited.  The address has applicability beyond the link, but it is
      known not to have global applicability.  Examples include IPv4
      private addresses [RFC1918] and IPv6 Unique Local Addresses
      [RFC4193].  Other cases include addresses on subnets which the



Carpenter, et al.       Expires November 12, 2009               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           Generic Referral Object                May 2009


      referring entity knows to be obstructed by firewalls, network
      address translators, or other barriers to transparency [RFC2775].
   o  Global.  The address has applicability beyond the link, and is
      believed to have global applicability within its address family.

   However, particularly in the case of limited scope, this is
   insufficient for the receiving entity to decide whether the address
   is applicable in the receiving entity's context.  The scopes above
   are described as if they were a set of concentric circles, but
   reality is more complex, and limited scopes might overlap each other
   in an arbitrary way, for example when multiple VPNs are formed.
   Indeed, a referring entity may or may not be aware that the receiving
   entity and the referenced entity are within a link scope or limited
   scope that does not contain the referring entity.  Therefore, a GRO
   may also include a scope identifier (ScopeID), which is an arbitrary
   label for a region of the network within which certain link or
   limited scope addresses are applicable.

   There needs to be a high level of assurance that ScopeIDs are unique,
   or at least that a GRO will never be forwarded outside a region in
   which ScopeIDs are unique.  Also, all referring and receiving
   entities need to be aware of the ScopeID(s) that apply to them.
   However, it is clearly undesirable to create a new global
   registration scheme for ScopeIDs.

   The delimiter of a limited scope will in many cases be the device
   (firewall or NAT) that obstructs transparency.  A tempting solution
   would be to use some unique identifier of that device as the unique
   ScopeID.  Unfortunately, this cannot be an IP address of the device,
   since in the case of nested NATs, all its addresses may be ambiguous.
   Neither can we rely on such a device having its own FQDN, or on that
   FQDN being known to all entities within the scope concerned.
   Finally, some limited scopes may not be hidden behind a single such
   device; for example, a limited scope might consist of a company's
   network and selected VPN connections to subsets of several business
   partners' networks.  Alternatively, multiple limited scopes might be
   hidden behind the same device.  Device addresses are therefore not
   suitable as ScopeIDs.

   Therefore, a limited scope can best be defined as whatever set of
   referring and receiving entities have been configured (statically or
   dynamically) to accept a given ScopeID in some unambiguous namespace
   (see Section 4.10).

   Methods for configuring, advertising and discovering ScopeIDs are not
   defined in this document.  However, in their absence, it is extremely
   hard for receiving entities to interpret and use information about
   limited scopes.  To the extent possible, all entities involved in



Carpenter, et al.       Expires November 12, 2009               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           Generic Referral Object                May 2009


   referrals should determine what scope is shared between the referred
   entity and the receiving entity, by any means.  Those means are not
   covered in this document, but may include use of external services,
   agreement on scope identifiers, or direct negotiation.
   o  If shared scope (or set of scopes) is determined, a referral
      should ideally only include information useful in that scope or
      set of scopes.
   o  If shared scope is uncertain, a referral should include all
      information that might be useful, taking privacy considerations
      into account.

   In general, the referring entity cannot know the scope in which the
   GRO will be interpreted.  For example, the initial receiving entity
   may itself be behind a NAT, unknown to the referring entity, or the
   receiving entity may send the GRO onwards to another host in yet
   another scope.  In practice, we have to leave the receiver to decide
   whether certain information is useful or not.  In the case of a
   ScopeID in particular, the referring entity is not required to know
   which ScopeIDs apply to the receiving entity.

   Discovery or negotiation of ScopeIDs between referring, referenced
   and receiving entities is certainly a possibility, but may be
   expensive, and is not assumed by this specification.

   A referring entity may obtain the address and port number for the
   referenced entity in various ways, and knowledge about this may help
   the receiving entity when combined with scope information.  For
   example, if the receiving entity is aware that the address has been
   translated, and that it has global scope, it may choose to use it
   without further checks.  If it is not marked as translated, and has
   limited scope, the receiving entity may then verify whether it has a
   suitable ScopeID.

   To enable such logic, a GRO may describe the source of an address or
   port number.  How knowledge of this source is obtained is outside the
   scope of the present specification, but ICE [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] is
   an example method.  It is also out of scope here to describe exactly
   how the receiving entity uses the information; for example GRO
   semantics do not include or imply preferences or priorities when
   multiple addresses are provided.  The receiving entity may choose to
   use a predefined policy, apply general logic as sketched in the
   previous paragraph, or follow application-specific logic, all based
   on the data provided in a GRO.

   Obviously, a GRO is no use unless it contains at least one item that
   can be used to find a path to the referred entry.  One option would
   be to make the presence of at least one IP address mandatory.
   However, there are alternatives, the most obvious one being an FQDN.

Internet-Draft           Generic Referral Object                May 2009


   Any form of identifier-locator separation, with HIP [RFC5201] as an
   example, may also offer an alternative.  Therefore, we do not require
   a GRO to include an IP address, even though its inclusion is a very
   likely case.


4.  Generic Referral Object Format

   A GRO is composed of a sequence of binary-encoded type-length-value
   fields (TLVs) transmitted in network byte order.  The TLV format is
   as follows:


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+..
   |   GRType    |Q|   GRLength    |          GRValue               ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+..


   A GRO MUST include at least one reference that allows a receiving
   entity to attempt to establish a path to the referred entity.  A
   typical case is an IPv4_address or IPv6_address TLV.  Multiple
   references may be present, and their order is not significant.

   Apart from this, all TLVs are OPTIONAL.

   [[ Discusssion invited: At the moment, there is no total length field
   or end flag for the whole GRO, assuming that GROs will be sent in
   some kind of container.  Opinions among the authors vary about
   whether this is OK. ]]

   GRType: Specifies the type of the current TLV.  GRType is encoded in
   7 bits.  The initially specified types are, in decimal:
      0: EOQ.
      1: IPv4_address.
      2: IPv6_address.
      3: FQDN.
      4: HIT.
      5: HI.
      65: IPv4_mask.
      66: IPv6_mask.
      67: Ref_lifetime.
      68: Ref_source.
      69: Ref_scope.
      70: ScopeID.

      127: reserved.

   A receiving entity MUST silently ignore any TLV with an unknown or
   reserved GRType.

   Each TLV is classified semantically as a reference or as a qualifier.
   A qualifier provides extra information about a reference or another
   qualifier..

   [[ Discusssion invited: Do we need a syntactic method of
   distinguishing references from qualifiers?  Since unknown TLVs are
   always discarded, why would that be needed? ]]

   Q bit: If this bit is set to 1, the current TLV is followed by one or
   more TLVs that qualify it.

   GRLength: The length in bytes of the GRValue field.  Thus, the total
   length of the TLV is GRLength+2 bytes.

   GRValue: The content and encoding depend on GRType.  Any padding
   required to fill an integral number of bytes MUST consist of a
   sequence of zero bits at the end of the content.

4.1.  End of Qualifiers (EOQ)

   This TLV follows the last TLV that qualifies a TLV whose Q bit is set
   to 1.  Its GRLength must be set to 0.

   The Q bit and EOQ MAY be used recursively, so that qualifiers may
   themselves be qualified if that proves to be useful.

       Example (GT=GRType):

       GT Q|GT Q|GT Q|GT Q|GT Q|GT Q|GT  Q|GT  Q
       A  1|xx 0|xx 0|B  1|xx 0|xx 0|EOQ 0|EOQ 0
                           <-------> Qualifiers of B
            <----------------------------> Qualifiers of A

   The Q bit MUST NOT be set in an EOQ TLV.

4.2.  IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses (references)

   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are encoded in their normal binary form, with
   GRLength being 4 and 16 respectively.

Internet-Draft           Generic Referral Object                May 2009


   When multiple addresses are provided, their order does not imply an
   order of preference.  The receiving entity SHOULD apply a local
   policy and mechanism to choose between alternative addresses, using
   other information included in the GRO appropriately.  This document
   does not describe such policies and mechanisms, which could be
   application specific.

4.3.  FQDN (reference)

   The Fully Qualified Domain Name of the referenced entity in ASCII
   format according to [RFC1035].

   The GRLength is variable (maximum 63).

   [[ Discussion invited: Is there also value in a generic URI item?
   See section on Extensibility below for a related discussion point. ]]

4.4.  HIT (reference)

   The Host Identity Tag of the referenced entity [RFC5201].

   The GRLength must be set to 16.

4.5.  HI (reference)

   The Host Identifier of the referenced entity [RFC5201].

   The GRLength is variable.

   [[ Discussion invited: Is this necessary in order to run the HIP base
   exchange?  The HI is a large object to include in a GRO.  Also, do we
   need a more precise definition of what the HI is (see section 5.2.8
   of RFC5201)? ]]

4.6.  IPv4 and IPv6 Masks (qualifiers)

   IPv4 and IPv6 masks are encoded in their normal binary form, with
   GRLength being 4 and 16 respectively.

4.7.  Ref_lifetime (qualifier)

   Remaining lifetime in seconds of the reference that it qualifies,
   encoded as a 32 bit binary number in the format of an IPv6 Valid
   Lifetime [RFC4861].  GRLength must be set to 4.

   If the lifetime is absent, or if it indicates an infinite lifetime
   [RFC4861], the receiving entity MUST assign a lifetime of one day to
   the corresponding reference.



Carpenter, et al.       Expires November 12, 2009              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           Generic Referral Object                May 2009


   The receiving entity MUST count down a received lifetime
   appropriately.  If the GRO is forwarded to an additional receiving
   entity, the lifetime MUST be updated appropriately.

   [[ Discussion invited: would it be better to specify an expiry
   timestamp? ]]

   [[ Discussion invited: is the default of one day reasonable? ]]

4.8.  Ref_source (qualifier)

   This is a single byte indicating the source of the reference that it
   qualifies.  GRLength must be set to 1.  The following values may be
   used:
      0: source was static configuration
      1: source was DNS lookup
      2: source was DHCP or DHCPv6
      3: source was SLAAC
      4: relayed address (e.g. from TURN [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] or
      SOCKS)
      5: translated address. ("server reflexive" in ICE
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] terminology.)

   A receiving entity MUST silently ignore unknown values.

4.9.  Ref_scope (qualifier)

   This is a single byte indicating the scope of the reference that it
   qualifies.  GRLength must be set to 1.  The scopes are explained in
   Section 3.  The currently defined values are as follows:
      0: Null
      1: Link
      2: Limited
      7: Global.  Note that some unused values precede this value, in
      case of future changes.

   A receiving entity MUST silently ignore unknown values.

   References qualified with the Null value SHOULD NOT be sent and MUST
   be silently ignored by a receiving entity.

   When a receiving entity receives a reference qualified with a Link or
   Limited Ref_scope, and without a ScopeID, it should take locally
   defined steps to check whether the reference is in fact within a
   reachable scope.

Internet-Draft           Generic Referral Object                May 2009


4.10.  ScopeID (qualifier)

   A ScopeID, if present, is a label for the scope of the reference that
   it qualifies.

   When a receiving entity receives a reference qualified with a
   Ref_scope and a ScopeID, it should verify the ScopeID against a list
   of ScopeIDs known to be reachable and if not, take other locally
   defined steps to check whether the reference is in fact within a
   reachable scope.

   ScopeIDs should be reasonably certain to be unique, yet require no
   new system for central administration.

   [[ Discusssion invited: It isn't clear to the authors that a single
   syntax for ScopeID is sufficient.  Should we allow for subtypes, so
   that (e.g.)  ULA format and FQDN format would both be possible?  The
   following proposal is tentative. ]]

   The proposed method is that each organisation that needs to define a
   ScopeID will first generate a ULA prefix as defined in [RFC4193], and
   then form a specific IPv6 address using that ULA prefix.  It is
   RECOMMENDED to form an address using a valid universal EUI-64
   interface identifier according to [RFC4291], and this EUI-64
   identifier MAY be the same one as used in the RFC4193 procedure.

   The GRLength must be set to 16.  The GRValue is the ScopeID in the
   format of an IPv6 address, although it will be treated entirely as an
   opaque binary value in the GRO referring and receiving entities.

4.11.  Port_number (qualifier)

   The inbound TCP/UDP/SCTP/DCCP port number associated with the
   reference that it qualifies.  The port number may be bound to a
   specific transport protocol (see next item).

   The GRLength must be set to 2.

   This TLV MAY be qualified by Transport_protocol or Port_source TLVs.
   An IP address may be qualified by zero, one or several Port_number
   TLVs.

4.12.  Transport_protocol (qualifier)

   This is a single byte indicating the IPv4 protocol number or IPv6
   Next Header value used with the reference or Port_number that it
   qualifies.  GRLength must be set to 1.




Carpenter, et al.       Expires November 12, 2009              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           Generic Referral Object                May 2009


   A receiving entity MUST silently ignore unknown values.

4.13.  Port_source (qualifier)

   This is a single byte indicating the source of the Port_number that
   it qualifies.  GRLength must be set to 1.  Accepted values are:
      0: direct (i.e. known to be the original port number used by the
      referenced entity)
      4: relayed port (e.g. from TURN [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] or SOCKS)
      5: translated port. ("server reflexive" in ICE
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] terminology.)

   [[ Discussion invited: Is this distinction usfeul? ]]

   The assigned values were chosen to align with those for Ref_source.
   A receiving entity MUST silently ignore unknown values.

4.14.  Extensibility

   Additional GRTypes may be assigned in the range up to 126 by IANA
   action as defined in Section 6.  The documentation of a new GRType
   must specify its name, define its GRLength, and describe the contents
   and meaning of its GRValue, including whether it is a reference or a
   qualifier.

   This extensibility is not intended to allow a GRO to grow enough to
   contain every possible kind of application-layer identifier that
   could ever be used in a referral, because then it would be too hard
   to write a generic "please connect me to the peer at this GRO"
   function.  Thus, additional GRTypes SHOULD NOT be assigned except for
   generic purposes that will apply to multiple applications.
   Similarly, additional sub-types for Address_source, Address_scope,
   Transport_protocol, and Port_source SHOULD NOT be assigned except for
   generic purposes.

   [[ Discussion invited: Sheng Jiang suggested that there should be a
   generic 'Application-specific ID' GRType, for example in URI format.
   A problem with this is that it might end up as a catch-all like a DNS
   TXT record, and threaten interoperability as a result. ]]

   The reserved GRType value 127 is intended to be used to define an
   extended range of GRTypes in the highly unlikely event that this
   becomes necessary.


5.  Security Considerations

   Forged or intercepted GROs would enable a wide variety of attacks.



Carpenter, et al.       Expires November 12, 2009              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft           Generic Referral Object                May 2009


   Although not fundamentally different from attacks based on forged or
   observed IP addresses or FQDNs, no doubt GROs would allow such
   attacks to be more ingenious, simply because they provide more
   information than an address or FQDN alone.  As noted in Section 2,
   GROs SHOULD be transmitted through authenticated and encrypted
   channels.  Since this is a requirement of the channel and not of the
   GRO, and the channel used depends on a specific use case, it is not
   further elaborated here.

   GROs are variable length objects with no defined maximum length.  It
   is possible that a malicious GRO could be constructed, with harmful
   code masquerading as legitimate or unknown GRType items.  All
   implementations of receiving entities MUST guard against buffer
   overflows, as well as obeying the rules about ignoring unknown values
   in Section 4.

   Unknown TLVs in GROs are to be ignored by the receiving entity.
   However, GROs may be forwarded to additional receiving entities, in
   which case the unknown TLVs will be forwarded too.  A receiving
   entity MAY remove unknown TLVs before forwarding a GRO, as a
   precaution against malicious use.

   GROs raise potential privacy issues, which are not explored in this
   document.  For example, in the SIP context, mechanisms such as
   [RFC3323] and [I-D.ietf-sip-ua-privacy] are available to hide
   information that might identify end-points.  Usage scenarios for GROs
   MUST ensure that they do not unintentionally defeat privacy
   solutions.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to established a Generic Referral Object (GRO)
   registry, containing sub-registries for GRType, Ref_source,
   Ref_scope, and Port_source.  The range and initial assignments are
   defined in Section 4.

   New values in this registry are to be assigned according to the
   Specification Required policy defined in [RFC5226], which implies
   review by a Designated Expert according to Section 4.14.

   [[ Discussion invited: It has been suggested to define a (small)
   registry for Global ScopeIDs, instead of assuming that "global" for
   IPv4 and IPv6 is unambiguous. ]]

Appendix A.  Example Use Cases

   [[ This appendix is incomplete and preliminary. ]]

   Referrals may be used to add an entity to a multi-party conversation,
   or they may be used (in applications such as telephony) as the first
   step of transferring one end of a conversation from the referring
   entity to the receiving entity. [[ Say more? ]]

   TBD: FTP/PORT, HTTP referrals... text needed

   BitTorrent is a distributed file sharing infrastructure.  It is based
   on P2P techniques for exchanging files between connected users.
   Three parties are involved in a BitTorrent architecture: (1) The
   server into which, has been uploaded the torrent file. (2) The
   Tracker which maintains a list of clients which have the file or some
   portions of that file. (3) Entities which are downloading and/or
   uploading portions of the file.  In order to download a given file, a
   BitTorrent client needs to obtain the corresponding torrent file
   (i.e. a file which includes the meta-data information of the file to
   be shared: the file name, its length, a hash and the URL of the
   tracker.).  Then, it connects to the tracker to retrieve a list of
   lechers (clients which are currently downloading the file but do not
   yet detain all the portions of the file) and seeders (clients which
   detain all the portions of the file and are uploading them to other
   requesting clients).  The client connects to those machines and
   downloads the available portions of the requested file.

   In a GRO for Skype purposes, if the address fails, you'd have to fall
   back to the Skype ID instead of an FQDN.  This is a case where
   allowing an application-specific ID might be valuable.  Another case
   would be Lotus Domino databases - if both IP address and FQDN fail to
   find the relevant server, the server name and the database name could

   be used as fallback identifiers.

   In SIP environments, a SIP Proxy Server intervenes in the placement
   of SIP sessions between two UAs.  Particularly, the SDP part of
   relayed SIP messages includes required information for establishment
   of RTP sessions (particularly IP address and port number).  A media
   description may be unidirectional or symmetric.  ICE and ANAT allow
   listing several network types and addresses in the same SDP offer.

   ANAT: ANAT [RFC4091],[RFC4092] is a procedure used by Dual Stack UAs
   to provide both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the context of a single
   logical media stream.  This helps interworking as, whatever the
   distant UA version is (IPv4/IPv6-only or Dual-Stack) provided that
   this latter is able to understand at least one of the offers.  ANAT
   semantic does not allow to characterize the IP address(es) it
   carries.  For instance, no indication if the UA is behind a
   translator or not is supported by ANAT (or even ICE).  ICE deprecates
   ANAT attribute.

   Atypes [I-D.boucadair-sipping-ipv6-atypes]: atypes is a SIP media
   feature tag which indicates the IP address type capabilities of the
   UA (User Agent) and can aid the routing process and ease the
   invocation of required functions (e.g.  SIP-ALG, NAT64, NAT46) when
   heterogeneous (i.e.  IPv4 and IPv6) parties are involved in a given
   SIP session.  Atypes can be used jointly with GRO (also with ICE and
   ANAT) to optimise the media path as experienced between involved
   parties (especially when Dual-stacks UAs are involved).
