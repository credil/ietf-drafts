INTERNET DRAFT               Historic RFCs              February 2, 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Historic status was firstly mentioned in RFC 1310 [RFC1310], and
   its definition remained unchanged in all the revisions of this
   document - RFC 1602 [RFC1602] and the most current RFC 2026
   [RFC2026].  However none of these documents give gives distinctive
   and precise description of this status, as well as procedures for
   Historic RFCs.  This caused misunderstandings of members of the
   community regarding the criteria the RFC should meet to become
   Historic, procedures for historicizing, etc.

   This document is to clarify the Historic status and procedures for
   moving RFCs to this status.  It also discusses some issues related to
   it, such as handling references to Historic RFCs, etc.  It updates
   RFC 2026 [RFC2026].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The term 'historicizing RFC' means the RFC that moves another one to
   Historic.

   The term 'historicized RFC' means the RFC that is moved to Historic
   by another one.

   The term 'superseding RFC' means the RFC that replaces another one.

   The term 'superseded RFC' means the RFC that is replaced by another
   one.

2.  Historic Status Definition

   The Historic status is used to identify that the particular RFC is
   obsolete (i.e. outdated), superseded or deprecated.  The criteria the
   RFC should meet to be considered as obsolete, superseded or
   deprecated are discussed in Section 2.1.  

   The Historic status MAY be assigned to RFCs of all categories
   following the procedures of Section 3 of this document.

2.1. Criteria for Historic RFCs

   If the RFC is replaced by another one, it SHALL be considered to be
   superseded.

   The RFC SHALL be considered to be obsolete if it meets the following
   criteria:

     a. It has been publicly available for at least 7 years; 

     b. During this period of time the technology, described in this RFC
     has not been seen used in the Internet or has been implemented
     early in the process of testing of this technology, but further
     implementations have not appeared.

   The RFC SHALL be considered to be deprecated if it meets at least one
   of the following criteria:

     a. It describes the technology that is replaced by other, more
     powerful technology, and, therefore, is NOT RECOMMENDED to be used;

     b. The technology, described in it contains a design flaw and
     SHOULD be avoided;

     c. It described the technology that might create serious problems
     with its implementation or makes it impossible.

3.  Procedures for Historic RFCs

   There are two different ways the Historic RFC may put itself on the
   map.  They are:

     a. Republication of RFC as Historic; and

     b. Reclassification of RFC as Historic.

   The procedures for these two cases are described below.

3.1. Republication of RFC as Historic

   One way to make the RFC Historic is to republish it in this status. 
   If such action is needed, the appropriate Internet-Draft with the
   intended status 'Historic' and that supersedes the historicized RFC
   SHALL be published.  The technical content of this Internet-Draft
   MUST be the same as in the historicized RFC.  Such document MUST
   contain the 'Historic Considerations' section clarifying the reason
   of republishing the document as Historic.

   The republication proposal SHALL firstly be discussed at the
   appropriate mailing list.  If the authors are sure that there is at
   least rough consensus on such action, they should apply to IESG to
   request the IETF-wide Last Call for republication the particular
   document as Historic.  If the Last Call revealed the wide consensus
   of the community, the corresponding RFC will be republished as
   Historic.

   There are a number of cases when the approval of another parties is
   needed for republication of RFC in Historic status.  In particular,
   if the historicized document has been processed on IAB Stream
   [RFC4844], the approval of IAB Chair is REQUIRED for historicizing
   such document.  If the document has been processed on IRTF or
   Independent Submissions Streams [RFC4844], the approval of IRTF Chair
   or the authors of the document (or the directors of the area the
   document is considered to be related to, in essential cases),
   respectively, is REQUIRED for moving such document to Historic.

3.2. Reclassification of RFC as Historic

   Reclassification of RFC as Historic is made via moving it to this
   status from the other one.  There are two possibilities for such
   action:

     a. There is a superseding RFC that moves the superseded one to
     Historic status; and

INTERNET DRAFT               Historic RFCs              February 2, 2011


     b. There is a separate historicizing RFC that moves the
     historicized one to Historic.

   The procedures for moving RFCs to Historic, depending on their
   initial status are described below.

3.2.1. Standards Track RFCs

   Historicizing of Standards Track RFCs SHALL be made following the
   'Standards Action' policies [RFC5226].  

3.2.2. Best Current Practices RFCs

   Best Current Practices (BCP) RFC MAY be historicized only in the case
   if it is being superseded by the other one.  In this case the usual
   procedure for BCP RFCs SHALL be followed [RFC2026].

3.2.3. Experimental RFCs

   Procedures for historicizing Experimental RFCs depend on their origin
   and the way it is being historicized.

3.2.3.1. Separate Historicizing Document

   The procedures described in this section apply to the case, mentioned
   as 'b' at the beginning of Section 3.2 (separate historicizing
   document).

   If the Experimental RFCs has been processed on IETF stream [RFC4844],
   'IETF Consensus' [RFC5226] is REQUIRED to historicize it.

   If the Experimental RFCs has been processed on IAB stream [RFC4844],
   'IETF Consensus' [RFC5226] and IAB Chair approval is REQUIRED to
   historicize it.

   If the Experimental RFCs has been processed on IRTF stream [RFC4844],
   'IETF Consensus' [RFC5226] and IRTF Chair approval is REQUIRED to
   historicize it.

   If the Experimental RFCs has been processed on Independent
   Submissions stream [RFC4844], 'IETF Consensus' [RFC5226] and authors'
   approval is REQUIRED to historicize it.  In essential cases the
   approval of the director of the area the historicized document is
   considered to be related to MAY be used instead the authors' one.

   In the cases described above IESG is responsible for recording their
   approval.

3.2.3.2. Superseding Document Historicizes the Superseded One

   The procedures described in this section apply to the case, mentioned
   as 'a' at the beginning of Section 3.2 (superseding document
   historicizes the superseded one).

   The superseding document that is being processed on the same stream
   [RFC4844] as the superseded one MAY historicize it without any
   special procedures; a simple mention of such action is therefore
   REQUIRED in superseding document.

   If the superseding document is being processed on the stream,
   different from that of superseded one, the approval of corresponding
   party is REQUIRED.  Section 3.2.3.1 describes some cases that apply
   this one as well (for IAB, IRTF, and Independent Submissions streams
   RFCs [RFC4844]).  Historicizing IETF-stream documents by non-IETF-
   stream ones is NOT allowed.

3.2.4. RFCs with No Particular Status

   RFCs with no particular status (see [RFCNOSTATUS]) SHALL be moved to
   Historic following the 'IETF Consensus' policies [RFC5226].

4.  Other Considerations

4.1. Handling References to Historic RFCs

   Normative references to Historic RFCs are NOT allowed in any RFCs, on
   the basis of the state of the referenced document on the date of
   publication of the referencing document.

   Informative references to Historic RFCs are allowed in any RFCs.

4.2. IANA Considerations in Historic RFCs

   The historicized document may have requested some action from IANA,
   that are already performed.  In this way the historicizing document
   SHALL clearly mention whether any action from IANA is needed once
   such document becomes Historic.

   [DISCUSS: Are there any other issues related to Historic docs. that
   should be discussed here?]


5.  Security Considerations

   Security issues are not discussed in this document.


6.  IANA Considerations

   None.  This section may be deleted.
