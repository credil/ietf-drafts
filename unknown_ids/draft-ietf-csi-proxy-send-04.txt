                    Secure Proxy ND Support for SEND
                      draft-ietf-csi-proxy-send-04

Abstract

   Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) specifies a method for securing
   Neighbor Discovery (ND) signaling against specific threats.  As
   defined today, SEND assumes that the node sending a ND message is the
   owner of the address from which the message is sent, so that it is in
   possession of the private key used to generate the digital signature
   on the message.  This means that the Proxy ND signaling performed by
   nodes that do not possess knowledge of the address owner's private
   key cannot be secured using SEND.  This document extends the current
   SEND specification in order to secure Proxy ND operation.

2.  Introduction

   Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971] specifies a method for
   securing Neighbor Discovery (ND) signaling [RFC4861] against specific
   threats [RFC3756].  As defined today, SEND assumes that the node
   sending a ND message is the owner of the address from which the
   message is sent, so that it is in possession of the private key used
   to generate the digital signature on the message.  This means that
   the Proxy ND signaling performed by nodes that do not possess
   knowledge of the address owner's private key cannot be secured using
   SEND.

   This document extends the current SEND specification with support for
   Proxy ND.  From this point on we refer to such extension as "Secure
   Proxy ND Support for SEND".

3.  Terminology

   Secure ND Proxy

      A node authorized to either modify or generate a SEND message
      without knowing the private key related to the source address of
      the ICMPv6 ND message.

   Proxied IPv6 address

      An IPv6 address that does not belong to the Secure ND Proxy and
      for which the Secure ND Proxy is performing advertisements.

   Non-SEND node

      An IPv6 node that does not implement the SEND [RFC3971]
      specification but uses only the ND protocol defined in [RFC4861]
      and [RFC4862], without security.

   RFC3971 node

      An IPv6 node that does not implement the specification defined in
      this document for Secure Proxy ND support, but uses only the SEND
      specification as defined in [RFC3971].

   SPND node

      An IPv6 node that receives and validates messages according to the
      specification defined in this document for Secure Proxy ND
      support.

4.  Secure Proxy ND Overview

   The original SEND specification [RFC3971] has implicitly assumed that
   only the node sending a ND message is the owner of the address from
   which the message is sent.  This assumption does not allow proxying
   of ND messages since the advertiser is required to generate a valid
   RSA Signature option, which in turns requires possession of the
   public-private key pair that was used to generate a CGA, or that was
   associated to a router certificate.

   To be able to separate the roles of ownership and advertiser the
   following extensions to the SEND protocol are defined:

   o  A Secure Proxy ND certificate, which is a certificate authorizing
      an entity to act as an ND proxy.  It is a X509v3 certificate in
      which the purpose for which the certificate is issued has been
      specified explicitly as described in a companion document
      [I-D.ietf-csi-send-cert].  Briefly, a KeyPurposeId value is
      defined for authorizing proxies.  The inclusion of the proxy
      authorization value allows the certificate owner to perform
      proxying of SEND messages for a range of addresses indicated in
      the same certificate.  This certificate can be exchanged through
      the Authorization Delegation Discovery process defined in
      [RFC3971].

   o  A new Neighbor Discovery option called Proxy Signature (PS)
      option.  This option contains the hash value of the public key of
      the proxy, and the digital signature of the SEND message computed
      with the private key of the proxy.  The hash of the public key of
      the proxy is computed over the public key contained in the Secure
      Proxy ND's certificate.  When a ND message contains a PS option,
      it MUST NOT contain CGA and RSA Signature options.  This option
      can be appended to any ND message: NA, NS, RS, RA and Redirect.

   o  A modification of the SEND processing rules for all ND messages:
      NA, NS, RS, RA, and Redirect.  When any of these messages
      containing a valid Proxy Signature option is validated, it is
      considered as secure.

   These extensions are applied in the following way:

   o  A Secure ND Proxy which proxies ND messages on behalf of a node
      can use the PS option to protect the proxied messages.  This
      Secure ND Proxy becomes part of the trusted infrastructure just
      like a SEND router.

   o  In order to allow nodes to successfully validate secured proxied
      messages, the nodes must be aware of the Secure Proxy ND

      certificate (in the format described in [I-D.ietf-csi-send-cert])
      and must apply the modified processing rules specified in this
      document.  We call these nodes 'SPND nodes'.  Note that the rules
      for generating ND messages in SPND nodes do not change, so these
      nodes behave as defined in [RFC3971] for sending ND messages.

   o  To allow SPND nodes to know the certificate path required to
      validate the public key of the proxy, devices responding to CPS
      (Certification Path Solicitation) messages with CPA (Certification
      Path Advertisements) as defined in Section 6 of SEND specification
      [RFC3971] are extended to support the certificate format specified
      in [I-D.ietf-csi-send-cert], and are configured with the
      appropriate certification path.

5.  Secure Proxy ND Specification

   A Secure ND Proxy performs all the operations described in the SEND
   specification [RFC3971] with the addition of new processing rules to
   ensure that the receiving node can differentiate between an
   authorized proxy generating or forwarding a SEND message for a
   proxied address, and a malicious node doing the same.

   This is accomplished by signing the message with the public key of
   the authorized Secure ND Proxy.  The signature of the ND Proxy is
   included in a new option called Proxy Signature (PS) option.  The
   signature is performed over all the NDP options present in the
   message and the PS option is appended as the last option in the
   message.

5.1.  Proxy Signature Option

   The Proxy Signature option allows public key-based signatures to be
   attached to NDP messages.  The format of the PS option is described
   in the following diagram:

   Type

      TBA

   Length

      The length of the option (including the Type, Length, Reserved,
      Key Hash, Digital Signature, and Padding fields) in units of 8
      octets.

   Reserved

      A 16-bit field reserved for future use.  The value MUST be
      initialized to zero by the sender, and MUST be ignored by the
      receiver.

   Key Hash

      A 128-bit field containing the most significant (leftmost) 128
      bits of a SHA-1 [SHA1] hash of the public key used for
      constructing the signature.  Its purpose is to associate the
      signature to a particular key known by the receiver.  Such a key
      MUST be the same one within the corresponding Secure Proxy ND's
      certificate.

   Digital Signature

      A variable-length field containing a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature,
      constructed by using the sender's private key over the following
      sequence of octets:

      1.  The 128-bit CGA Message Type tag [RFC3972] value for Secure
          Proxy ND, 0x09F5 2BE5 3B62 4C76 CB96 4E7F CDC9 2804 (The tag
          value has been generated randomly by the editor of this
          specification).

      2.  The 128-bit Source Address field from the IP header.

      3.  The 128-bit Destination Address field from the IP header.

      4.  The 8-bit Type, 8-bit Code, and 16-bit Checksum fields from
          the ICMP header.

      5.  The NDP message header, starting from the octet after the ICMP
          Checksum field and continuing up to but not including NDP
          options.

      6.  All NDP options preceding the Proxy Signature option.

      The signature value is computed with the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5
      algorithm and SHA-1 hash, as defined in [RSA].

      This field starts after the Key Hash field.  The length of the
      Digital Signature field is determined by the ASN.1 BER coding of
      the PKCS#1 v1.5 signature.

   Padding

      This variable-length field contains padding.  The length of the
      padding field is determined by the length of the Proxy Signature
      Option minus the length of the other fields.

5.2.  Modified SEND processing rules

   The modifications described in the following section applies when a
   SEND message contains the PS option, i.e. the message was sent by a
   Secure ND Proxy.

   This specification modifies the sender and receiver processing rules
   defined in the SEND specification [RFC3971].

5.2.1.  Processing rules for senders

   A ICMPv6 message sent by a Secure ND Proxy for a proxied address MUST
   contain a PS option and MUST NOT contain either CGA or RSA Signature
   options.

   A Secure ND Proxy sending a SEND message with the PS option MUST
   construct the message as follows:

   1.  The SEND message is constructed without the PS option as follows:

       A.  If the Secure ND Proxy is locally generating the SEND message
           for a proxied address, the message MUST be constructed as
           described in Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6
           specification [RFC4861].

       B.  If the Secure ND Proxy is forwarding a SEND message, first
           the authenticity of the intercepted message MUST be verified
           as specified in SEND specification [RFC3971], Section 5.  If
           the SEND message is valid, any CGA or RSA option MUST be
           removed from the message.  The intercepted message is finally
           modified as described in Section 4 of the ND Proxy
           specification [RFC4389].

Internet-Draft      Secure Proxy ND Support for SEND            May 2010


       C.  If the Secure ND Proxy is forwarding a SEND message already
           containing a PS option, first the authenticity of the
           intercepted message is verified as specified in Section 5.2.2
           of this specification.  If the SEND message is valid, the
           original PS option MUST be removed from the message.  The
           intercepted message is finally modified as described in
           Section 4 of the ND Proxy specification [RFC4389].

   2.  Timestamp and Nonce options MUST be included according to the
       rules specified in SEND [RFC3971].  The value in the Timestamp
       option MUST be generated by the proxy.  If the proxy is
       forwarding a message, the Nonce value in the proxied message MUST
       be the same as in the forwarded message, otherwise it is
       generated by the proxy.

   3.  The Proxy Signature option MUST be added as the last option in
       the message.

   4.  The data MUST be signed as explained in Section 5.1.

5.2.2.  Processing rules for receivers

   Any SEND message without a Proxy Signature option MUST be treated as
   specified in the SEND specification [RFC3971].

   A SEND message including a Proxy Signature option MUST be processed
   as specified below:

   1.  The receiver MUST ignore any RSA and CGA options, as well as any
       options that might come after the first PS option.  The options
       are ignored for both signature verification and NDP processing
       purposes.

   2.  The Key Hash field MUST indicate the use of a known public key.
       A valid certification path (see [RFC3971] Section 6.3) between
       the receiver's trust anchor and the sender's public key MUST be
       known.  The Secure Proxy ND's X509v3 certificate MUST contain a
       extended key usage extension including the KeyPurposeId value for
       the proxy authorization.

   3.  The Digital Signature field MUST have correct encoding.

   4.  The Digital Signature verification MUST show that the signature
       has been calculated as specified in Section 5.1.

   5.  The Nonce option MUST be processed as specified in [RFC3971]
       Section 5.3.4, except for replacing 'RSA Signature option' by 'PS
       option'.

   6.  The Timestamp option MUST be processed as specified in [RFC3971]
       Section 5.3.4, except for replacing 'RSA Signature option' by 'PS
       option'.  The receiver SHOULD store the peer-related timing
       information specified in [RFC3971] Section 5.3.4.1 and 5.3.4.2
       (RDlast, TSlast) separately for each different proxy (which can
       be identified by the different Key Hash values of the proxied
       message) and separately from the timing information associated to
       the IP of node for which the message is proxied.  In this way, a
       message received for the first time from a proxy (i.e. for which
       there is no information stored in the cache) for which the
       Timestamp option is checked, SHOULD be checked as messages
       received from new peers (as in [RFC3971] section 5.3.4.2).

   7.  Messages with the Override bit [RFC4861] set MUST override an
       existing cache entry regardless if it was created as a result of
       a RSA Signature option or a PS option validation.  When the
       Override bit is not set, the advertisement MUST NOT update a
       cached link-layer address created securily by means of RSA
       Signature option or PS option validation.

   Messages that do not pass all the above tests MUST be silently
   discarded if the host has been configured to accept only secured ND
   messages.

5.3.  Proxying Link-Local Addresses

   Secure Neighbor Discovery [RFC3971] relies on certificates to prove
   that routers are authorized to announce a certain prefix.  However,
   Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] states that router does not announce the
   Link-Local prefix (fe80::/64).  Hence, it is not required for a SEND
   certificate to hold a X.509 extension for IP addresses that
   authorizes the fe80::/64 prefix.  However, some Secure Proxy ND
   scenarios ([RFC4389], [RFC5213]) impose providing the proxying
   function for the Link-Local address of a node.  When Secure ND proxy
   functionality for a Link-Local address is required, either a list of
   link-local addresses, or the fe80::/64 prefix MUST be explicitly
   authorized to be proxied in the corresponding certificate.

6.  Application Scenarios

   In this section we describe three different application scenarios for
   which Secure Proxy ND support for SEND can be applied.  Note that the
   particular way in which Secure Proxy ND support is applied (which ND
   messages are proxied, in which directions, how the interaction with
   non-SEND hosts and RFC3971 hosts is handled, etc.) largely depends on
   the particular scenario considered.  In the first two scenarios
   presented below, ND messages are synthesized on behalf of off-link
   nodes.  In the third one, ND message generation is trigged by the
   reception of ND messages in other interfaces of the proxy.

6.1.  Scenario 1: Mobile IPv6

   The description of the problems for deploying SEND in this scenario
   can be found in [I-D.ietf-csi-sndp-prob].

   The Mobile IPv6 protocol (MIPv6) [RFC3775] allows a Mobile Node (MN)
   to move from one link to another while maintaining reachability at a
   stable address, the so-called MN's Home Address (HoA).  When a MN
   attaches to a foreign network, all the packets sent to the MN's HoA
   by a Correspondent Node (CN) on the home link or a router, are
   intercepted by the Home Agent (HA) on that home link, encapsulated
   and tunneled to the MN's registered Care-of Address (CoA).

   The HA intercepts these packets acting as a ND proxy for this MN.
   When a NS is intercepted on the home link, the HA checks if the
   Target address within the NS matches with any of the MN's Home
   Address in the Binding Cache and if so, it replies with a Neighbor
   Advertisement (NA) constructed as described in [RFC4861], containing
   its own link layer address (HA_LL) as the Target Link Layer Address
   Option (TLLAO).  Then a timestamp (generated by the proxy) and nonce
   (if appropriate, according to [RFC3971]), MUST be included.  Finally,
   a PS option signing the message MUST be included as the last option
   of the message.

            Figure 2: Proxy ND role of the Home agent in MIPv6

   A node receiving the NA containing the PS option (e.g.: the CN in the
   home link, or a router) MUST apply the rules defined in
   Section 5.2.2.  Note that in this case the Override bit of the NA
   message is used to control which messages should prevail each case:
   the message generated by the proxy once the MN moves from the home
   network, or the MN if it comes back to the home link, as defined in
   the MIPv6 specification [RFC3775]

6.2.  Scenario 2: Proxy Mobile IPv6

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network-based mobility management
   protocol that provides an IP mobility management support for MNs
   without requiring MNs being involved in the mobility related
   signaling.  The IP mobility management is totally hidden to the MN in
   a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain and is performed by two functional

   entities: the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) and the Mobile Access
   Gateway (MAG).

   When the MN connects to a new access link, it will send a multicast
   ICMPv6 Router Solicitation (RS).  The MAG on the new access link,
   upon detecting the MN's attachment, will signal the LMA for updating
   the binding state of the MN (Proxy Binding Update - PBU) and once the
   signaling is completed (it receives a Proxy Binding Ack - PBA), it
   will reply to the MN with a ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA)
   containing the home network prefix(es) that were assigned to that
   mobility session, making the MN believe it is still on the same link
   and not triggering the IPv6 address reconfiguration (Figure 3).

                Figure 3: Mobile node's handover in PMIPv6


   To avoid potential link-local address collisions between the MAG and
   the MN after a handoff to a new link, the Proxy Mobile IPv6
   specification requires the MAG's link-local address configured on the
   link to which the MN is attached to, to be generated by the LMA when
   the MN first attach to a PMIPv6 domain, and to be provided to the new
   MN's serving MAG after each handoff.  Thus, from the MN's point of
   view, the MAG's link-local address remains constant for the duration
   of that MN's session.

   The approach described above and the current SEND specification are
   incompatible since sharing the same link-local address on different
   MAGs would require all MAGs of a PMIPv6 domain to construct the CGA
   and the RSA Signature option with the same public-private key pair,
   which is not acceptable from a security point of view.

   Using different public-private key pairs on different MAGs would mean
   different MAGs use different CGAs as link-local address.  Thus the
   serving MAG's link-local address changes after each handoff of the MN
   which is contradiction with the way MAG link-local address assignment
   occurs in a PMIPv6 domain.

   To provide SEND protection, each MAG is configured to act as a proxy
   by means of a certificate associated to the PMIPv6 domain,
   authorizing each MAG to proxy securely ND messages.  In addition, the
   certificate must also authorize the MAG to advertise prefixes.  Note
   that the inclusion of multiple KeyPurposeId values is supported by
   [I-D.ietf-csi-send-cert].

   When a MAG replies to a RS with a RA, the source address MUST be
   equal to the MAG link-local address associated to the MN in this
   PMIPv6 domain and its own link layer address as Source link-layer
   address.  Then a timestamp (generated by the proxy) and nonce (if
   appropriate, according to [RFC3971]), MUST be included.  Finally, a
   PS option signing the message MUST be included as the last option of
   the message.  This procedure is followed for any other ND message
   that could be generated by the MAG to a MN.

   A node receiving a message from the MAG containing the PS option MUST
   apply the rules defined in Section 5.2.2.  Note that unsolicited
   messages sent by MAG are validated by the host according to timestamp
   values specific to the MAG serving the link, not to any other MAG to
   which the host has been connected before in other links.

   method by which multiple link layer segments are bridged into a

   bridging under these circumstances.

   ICMPv6 messages: NS, NA, RA, or Redirect.  The Secure ND Proxy MUST
   verify the authenticity of the received ND message, according to
   [RFC3971].  If the SEND message is valid, then it proxies the
   original message with the following changes:

   1.  The message MUST be processed according to [RFC4389].  This
       includes changing the source link layer address to the address of
       the outgoing interface, maintaining the destination link layer
       address as the address in the neighbor entry corresponding to the
       destination IPv6 address, etc.  In particular any link layer
       address within the payload (that is, in a Source Local Link
       Address option - SLLAO, or a Target Local Link Address option -
       TLLAO) is substituted with the link-layer address of the outgoing
       interface.

   2.  Any CGA or RSA option MUST be removed.

   3.  If a Nonce option existed in the original message, its value MUST
       be preserved in the proxied message.  The Timestamp MUST be
       generated by the proxy.

   4.  The PS option MUST be added as the last option in the message,
       signing all the information contained so far in the message.

   When any other IPv6 unicast packet is received on a proxy interface,
   if it is not locally destined then it is forwarded unchanged (other
   than using a new link-layer header) to the proxy interface for which
   the next hop address appears in the neighbor cache.  If no neighbor
   cache entry is present, the ND proxy should queue the packet and
   initiate a Neighbor Discovery signalling as if the ICMPv6 NS message
   were locally generated.

   In order to deploy this scenario, nodes in proxied segments MUST know
   the certificate authorizing proxy operation.  To do so it could be
   required to configure at least one device per each proxied segment
   (may be the proxy itself) to propagate the required certification
   path to authorize proxy operation by means of a CPS/CPA exchange.

7.  Backward Compatibility with RFC3971 nodes and non-SEND nodes

   In this section we discuss the interaction of Secure ND Proxies and
   SPND nodes with RFC3971 nodes and non-SEND nodes.

7.1.  Backward Compatibility with RFC3971 nodes

   RFC3971 nodes, i.e.  SEND nodes not compliant with the modifications
   required in Section 5 cannot interpret correctly a PS option received
   in a proxied ND message.  These SEND nodes silently discard the PS
   option, as specified in [RFC4861] for any unknown option.  As a
   result, these messages will be treated as unsecured as described in
   Section 8 "Transitions Issues" of the SEND specification [RFC3971].

   When RFC3971 nodes and SPND nodes exchange ND messages (without proxy
   intervention), in either direction, messages are generated according
   to the SEND specification [RFC3971], so these nodes interoperate
   seamlessly.

   In the scenarios in which the proxy translates ND messages, the
   messages to translate can either be originated in a RFC3971 node or
   in an SPND node, without interoperability issues.

7.2.  Backward Compatibility with non-SEND nodes

   Non-SEND nodes receiving NDP packets silently discard PS options, as
   specified in [RFC4861] for any unknown option.  Therefore, these
   nodes interpret messages proxied by a Secure ND Proxy as any other ND
   message.

   When non-SEND nodes and SPND nodes exchange ND messages (without
   proxy intervention), in either direction, the rules specified in
   section 8 of [RFC3971] apply.

   A Secure ND Proxy SHOULD support the use of secured and unsecured NDP
   messages at the same time, although it MAY have a configuration that
   causes not to perform proxing for unsecured NDP messages.  A Secure
   ND Proxy MAY also have a configuration option whereby it disables
   secure ND proxying completely.  This configuration SHOULD be switched
   off by default, that is SEND is used by default.  In the next
   paragraphs we discuss the recommended behavior of the Secure ND Proxy
   regarding to the protection level to provide to proxied messages in a
   mixed scenario involving SPND/RFC3971 nodes and non-SEND nodes.  In
   particular, two different situations occur depending on if the
   proxied nodes are RFC3971 or SPND, or if they are non-SEND nodes.

   As a rule of thumb, if the proxied nodes can return to the link in
   which the proxy operates, the Secure ND Proxy MUST only generate PS

   options on behalf of nodes with SEND capabilities (i.e. that they
   could use SEND to defend their messages if being in the same link
   than the proxy, either RFC3971 nodes or SPND nodes).  This is
   relevant to allow nodes preferring secured information over unsecured
   one, and for executing the DAD procedure, as specified in [RFC3971].
   Therefore, the Secure ND Proxy MUST generate messages containing the
   PS option for SPND and RFC3971 hosts, and MUST NOT generate messages
   containing the PS option for non-SEND nodes.  Note that ND
   advertisements in response to solicitations generated by a Secure ND
   Proxy must be secured or not according to the previous considerations
   (i.e. to the nature of the proxied node), and not according to the
   secure or unsecure nature of the solicitation message.

   To apply this rule, we have to consider that depending on the
   application scenario the proxy may translate ND messages generated by
   a node or synthetise ND messages on behalf of a node that can return
   to the link in which the Secure ND Proxy operates.

   o  For translating ND messages for nodes that can arrive to the link
      in which the proxy operates, the rule can be easily applied: only
      messages validated in the Secure ND Proxy according to the SEND
      specification [RFC3971] MUST be proxied securely by the inclusion
      of a PS option.  Unsecured ND messages could be proxied if
      unsecured operation is enabled in the proxy, but the message
      generated by the Secure ND Proxy for the received message MUST NOT
      include a PS option.

   o  For synthesizing ND messages on behalf of remote nodes, different
      considerations should be made according to the particular
      application scenario.

      *  For MIPv6, if the MN can return to the home link, it is
         required for the proxy to know if the node could use SEND to
         defend its address or not.  A mismatch between the proxy and
         proxied node behavior regarding to SEND operation would result
         in unaproppriate operation.  A HA including the PS option for
         proxying a non-SEND MN would make ND messages sent by the proxy
         to be more preferred than ND message of the non-SEND MN when
         the MN returns to the home link (even if the proxied messages
         have the Override bit set to 1).  Not using the PS option for a
         RFC3971 or SPND MN would make more vulnerable the address in
         the home link when the MN is away than when it is in the home
         link (and would defeat the purpose of the Secure Proxy ND
         mechanism).  Therefore, in this case the HA MUST know the SEND
         capabilities of the MN, and MUST use PS option if the MN is a
         SPND or RFC3971 host, and MUST NOT use PS option for non-SEND
         hosts.

      *  For the Proxy Mobile IPv6 scenario, we have to note that a node
         moving from a link in which PS option has been used to protect
         a link-layer address to a link in which ND messages are not
         protected by SEND would prevent the MN from adquiring the new
         information until the cached information expires.  However, in
         this case it is reasonable to consider that all MAGs provide
         the same security for protecting ND messages, and that either
         all MAGs will behave as Secure ND Proxy, or none, so
         configuration could be easier.

8.  Security Considerations

   The mechanism described in this document introduces a new Proxy
   Signature (PS) Option allowing a Secure ND Proxy to generate or
   modify a SEND message for a proxied address.  A SPND node will only
   accept such a message if it includes a valid PS option generated by
   an authorized Secure ND Proxy.  Such a message has equivalent
   protection to the threats presented in section 9 of [RFC3971] as a
   message signed with a RSA Signature option.

   The security of proxied ND messages not including a PS option is the
   same of an unsecured ND message.  The security of a proxied ND
   message received by a non-SEND host or RFC3971 host is the same of an
   unsecured ND message.

   Thanks to the authorization certificate it is provisioned with, a
   proxy ND is authorized to issue ND signaling on behalf of nodes on
   the subnet.  Thus, a compromised proxy is able, like a compromised
   router, to siphon off traffic from the host, or mount a man-in-the-
   middle attack.  However, when two on-link hosts communicate using
   their respective link-local addresses, the threats involved with a
   compromised router and a compromised proxy ND differs because the
   router is not able to siphon off traffic exchanged between the hosts
   or mount a man-in-the-middle attack, while the proxy ND can, even if
   the hosts use SEND.

   The messages for which a Secure ND Proxy performs its function, and
   the link for which this function is performed MUST be configured
   appropriately for each proxy and scenario.  This configuration is
   specially relevant if Secure Proxy ND is used for translating ND
   messages from one link to another.

   Proper configuration of when the PS option must or must not be
   included, depending on the proxied nodes being SEND or non-SEND may
   result in security considerations which are discussed in Section 7.

   Attacks to the timestamp of the secured ND message can be performed
   as described in section 7.3 of [I-D.ietf-csi-sndp-prob].

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate:

      A new IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option type for the PS option, as
      TBA.  The value need to be allocated from the namespace specified
      in the IANA registry IPv6 NEIGHBOR DISCOVERY OPTION FORMATS
      located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6-parameters.

      A new 128-bit value under the CGA Message Type [RFC3972]
      namespace, 0x09F5 2BE5 3B62 4C76 CB96 4E7F CDC9 2804.
