Abstract 
   
  The computation of one or a set of Traffic Engineering Label Switched 
  Paths (TE LSPs) in MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) and 
  Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks, is subject to a set of one or more 
  specific optimization criteria, referred to as an objective function 
  (e.g. minimum cost path, widest path, etc.).  
  A Path Computation Client (PCC) may want a path to be computed for 
  one or more TE LSPs according to a specific objective  function. Thus, 
  the PCC needs to instruct the PCE to use the correct objective 
  function. Furthermore, it is possible that not all PCEs support the 
  same set of objective functions, therefore it is useful for the PCC 
  to be able to automatically discover the set of objective functions 
  supported by each PCE.  
  This document defines extensions to the PCE communication Protocol 
  (PCEP) to allow a PCE to indicate the set of objective functions it 
  supports. Extensions are also defined so that a PCC can indicate in 
  a path computation request the required objective function, and so 
  that a PCE can report in a path computation reply the objective 
  function that was used for path computation.

1. Introduction 

  The PCE-based network architecture [RFC4655] defines a Path 
  Computation Element (PCE) as an entity capable of computing TE LSP 
  paths based on a network graph, and applying computational 
  constraints.  A PCE services path computation requests sent by Path 
  Computation Clients (PCC).  
   
  The PCE communication Protocol (PCEP), defined in [PCEP], allows for 
  communication between a PCC and a PCE or between two PCEs, in 

Le Roux, Vasseur, Lee Encoding of Objective Functions in PCEP  [Page 3] 
 
Internet Draft         draft-ietf-pce-of-03.txt              July 2008 


  compliance with requirements and guidelines set forth in [RFC4657]. 
  Such interactions include path computation requests and path 
  computation replies.  
   
  The computation of one or a set of TE LSPs is subject to a set of one 
  or more optimization criteria, called an objective function. An 
  objective function is used by the PCE, when it computes a path or a 
  set of paths, in order to select the "best" candidate paths. There is 
  a variety of objective functions: an objective function could apply 
  either to a set of non-synchronized path computation requests, or to 
  a set of synchronized path computation requests. In the former case, 
  the objective function refers to an individual path computation 
  request (e.g. computation of the shortest constrained path where the 
  metric is the IGP metric, computation of the least loaded constrained 
  path, etc.). Conversely in the latter case, the objective function 
  refers to a set of path computation requests the computation of which 
  is synchronized (e.g. minimize the aggregate bandwidth consumption of 
  all LSPs, minimize the sum of the delays for two diverse paths, or 
  the delta between those delays, etc.). Moreover, some objective 
  functions relate to the optimization of a single metric and others to 
  the optimization of a set of metrics (organized in a hierarchical 
  manner, using a weighted function, etc.). 

  As spelled out in [RFC4674], it may be useful for a PCC to discover 
  the set of objective functions supported by a PCE. Furthermore, 
  [RFC4657] requires the ability for a PCC to indicate in a path 
  computation request a required/desired objective function, as well as 
  optional function parameters. 
   
  For these purposes, this document extends the PCE communication 
  Protocol (PCEP). It defines PCEP extensions allowing a PCE to 
  advertise a list of supported objective functions, as well as 
  extensions to carry the objective function in PCEP request and reply 
  messages. It complements the PCEP base specification [PCEP]. 

  Note that IS-IS and OSPF based PCE Discovery mechanisms are defined 
  in ([RFC5089], [RFC5088]). These mechanisms are dedicated to the 
  discovery of a few generic parameters while more detailed PCE 
  parameters should be discovered using the PCE communication Protocol. 
  Objective functions are in this second category; thus the Objective 
  Function discovery procedure is handled by PCEP. 

  A new PCEP TLV, named the OF-List TLV is defined in Section 2. The 
  OF-List TLV is carried in the PCEP OPEN object and allows a PCE to 
  list, during PCEP session setup phase, the objective functions that 
  it supports. 
   
  A new PCEP object, the OF object, is defined in Section 3. The OF 
  object is carried within a PCReq message to indicate the 
  required/desired objective function to be applied by a PCE, or in a 
  PCRep message to indicate the objective function that was used for 
  path computation.

  Six mandatory objective functions that must be supported by PCEP are 
  listed in [RFC4657]. This document provides, in Section 4, a 
  definition of these six mandatory objective functions. Additional 
  objective functions may be defined in other documents. Note that 
  additional objective functions are defined for PCE Global Concurrent 
  Optimization (GCO) application, in [PCE-GCO]. This document also 
  provides, in Section 5, the definition of four new metric types that 
  apply to a set of synchronized requests.  
   

2. Discovery of PCE Objective Functions 
 
  This section defines PCEP extensions (see [PCEP]) so as to support 
  the advertisement of the objective functions supported by a PCE.  
   
  A new PCEP OF-List (Objective Function list) TLV is defined. The PCEP 
  OF-List TLV is carried within an OPEN object, in order for a PCE to 
  advertise to a PCEP peer the list of objective functions it supports, 
  during PCEP session setup phase.  
   
2.1. OF-List TLV  
   
  The PCEP OF-List TLV is optional. It MAY be carried within an OPEN 
  object sent by a PCE in an Open message to a PCEP peer, so as to 
  indicate the list of supported objective functions.  

  The OF-List TLV format is compliant with the PCEP TLV format defined 
  in [PCEP]. That is, the TLV is composed of 2 octets for the type, 2 
  octets specifying the TLV length, and a value field. The Length field 
  defines the length of the value portion in octets. The TLV is padded 
  to four-octet alignment and padding is not included in the Length 
  field (e.g. a three octet value would have a length of three, but the 
  total size of the TLV would be eight octets). 
   
  The PCEP OF-List TLV has the following format: 

        TYPE: To be assigned by IANA  (suggested value = 4 ) 
        LENGTH: N * 2 (where N is the number of objective functions) 
        VALUE: list of 2-bytes objective function code points, 
               identifying the objective functions supported by the  
               sender of the Open message.

  OF Code (2 bytes): Objective Function code point identifier. 

  IANA is requested to manage the PCE objective function code point 
  registry (see Section 6). 


2.2. Elements of procedure  
   
  A PCE MAY include an OF-List TLV within an OPEN object in an Open 
  message sent to a PCEP peer, to advertise a set of one or more 
  objective functions. The OF-List TLV MUST NOT appear more than once 
  in an OPEN object. If it appears more than once the PCEP session MUST 
  be rejected with error type 1 and error value 1 (PCEP session 
  establishment failure / Reception of an invalid Open message). 
  The absence of the OF-List TLV in an OPEN object MUST be interpreted 
  as an absence of information on the list of supported objective 
  functions by the PCE. 
   
  As specified in [PCEP], a PCEP peer that does not recognize the OF-
  List TLV will silently ignore it. 
   
   
3. Objective Function in PCEP Path Computation Request and Reply 
   Messages 
   
  This section defines PCEP extensions ([PCEP]) so as to support the 
  communication of objective functions in PCEP path computation request 
  and reply messages. A new PCEP OF (Objective Function) object is 
  defined, to be carried within a PCReq message in order for the PCC to 
  indicate the required/desired objective function.  
   
  The PCEP OF Object may also be carried within a PCRep message in 
  order for the PCE to indicate the objective function that was used by 
  the PCE.  
   
  A new flag is defined in the RP object. The flag is used in a PCReq 
  message to indicate that the PCE MUST include an OF object in the 
  PCRep message to indicate the objective function that was used during 
  path computation. 

  Also, new PCEP error types and values are defined. 

3.1. OF Object 

  The PCEP OF (Objective Function) object is optional. It MAY be 
  carried within a PCReq message so as to indicate the desired/required 
  objective function to be applied by the PCE during path computation,

  or within a PCRep message so as to indicate the objective function 
  that was used by the PCE during path computation. 

  The OF object format is compliant with the PCEP object format defined 
  in [PCEP]. 

  The OF Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA (recommended value=21). 
  The OF Object-Type is to be assigned by IANA (recommended value=1). 
   
   
  The format of the OF object body is: 
   
   0                   1                   2                   3

  Objective Function Code (2 bytes): The identifier of the Objective 
  Function. The IANA is requested to manage the PCE objective function 
  code point registry (see Section 6). 
   
  Reserved (2 bytes): This field MUST be set to zero on transmission 
  and MUST be ignored on receipt. 
   
  Optional TLVs may be defined in the future so as to encode objective 
  function parameters. 
   
3.1.1. Elements of Procedure 
   
  To request the use of a specific objective function by the PCE, a  
  PCC includes an OF object in the PCReq message. 
   
  [PCEP] specifies a bit flag, referred to as the P bit, carried in  
  the common PCEP object header. The P bit is set by a PCC to mandate  
  that a PCE must take the information carried in the object into 
  account during the path computation. 

  If the P bit is set in the OF object, the objective function is 
  mandatory (required objective function) and the PCE MUST use the 
  objective function during path computation. If the P bit is clear  
  in the OF object, the objective function is optional (desired  
  objective function) and the PCE SHOULD apply the function if it is 
  supported, but MAY choose to apply a different objective function 
  according to local capabilities and policies. 
   


Le Roux, Vasseur, Lee Encoding of Objective Functions in PCEP  [Page 7] 
 
Internet Draft         draft-ietf-pce-of-03.txt              July 2008 


  On receipt of a PCReq message with an OF object, a PCE MUST proceed  
  as follows: 

       - If the OF object is unknown/unsupported, the PCE MUST follow  
         procedures defined in [PCEP], that is if the P bit is set, it  
         sends a PCErr message with error type 3 or 4  
         (Unknown / Not supported object) and error value 1 or 2  
         (unknown / unsupported  object class / object type), and the  
         related path computation request MUST be discarded. If the P  
         bit is cleared it is free to ignore the object. 
        
       - If the objective function is unknown / unsupported and the P  
         bit is set, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with error type   
         3 or 4 (Unknown/Not supported Object) and error value 4  
         (Unrecognized/Unsupported parameter), and the related path  
         computation request MUST be discarded.  
      
       - If the objective function is unknown / unsupported and the P  
         bit is cleared, the PCE SHOULD apply another (default)     
         objective function. 
        
       - If the objective function is supported but policy does not  
         permit applying it, and the P bit is set, the PCE MUST send a  
         PCErr message with the PCEP error type "policy-violation"  
         (type 5) and a new error value "objective function not  
         allowed" (defined in this document). 
   
       - If the objective function is supported but policy does not  
          allow applying it, and the P bit is cleared, the PCE SHOULD 
          apply another (default) objective function. 
        
       - If the objective function is supported and policy allows  
         applying it, then if the P bit is set the PCE MUST apply the    
         requested objective function, else if the P bit is cleared the   
         PCE is free to apply any other objective function.  
        
       The default objective function may be locally configured. 
        

3.2. Carrying The OF Object In a PCEP Message 
   
  The OF object MAY be carried within a PCReq message. If an objective 
  function is to be applied to a set of synchronized path computation 
  requests, the OF object MUST be carried just after the corresponding 
  SVEC object, and MUST NOT be repeated for each elementary request. 
   
  Similarly if a metric is to be applied to a set of synchronized  
  requests, the METRIC object MUST follow the SVEC object and MUST not  
  be repeated for each elementary request. Note that metrics applied to  
  a set of synchronized requests are defined in section 5.

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-pce-of-03.txt              July 2008 


  An OF object specifying an objective function that applies to an 
  individual path computation request (non synchronized case) MUST 
  follow the RP object for which it applies. 
   

  The format of the PCReq message is updated as follows:  
   
    <PCReq Message>::= <Common Header> 
         [<SVEC-list>] 
         <request-list> 
   
     where: 
        <svec-list>::=<SVEC> 
       [<OF>] 
       [<metric-list>] 
       [<svec-list>] 
         
        <request-list>::=<request>[<request-list>] 
   
        <request>::= <RP> 
      <END-POINTS> 
      [<LSPA>] 
      [<BANDWIDTH>] 
      [<metric-list>] 
      [<OF>] 
      [<RRO>] 
      [<IRO>] 
      [<LOAD-BALANCING>] 
     where: 
   
     <metric-list>::=<METRIC>[<metric-list>] 

   
  The OF object MAY be carried within a PCRep message to indicate the 
  objective function used by the PCE during path computation. 
   
  When the PCE wants to indicate to the PCC the objective function that 
  was used for the synchronized computation of a set of paths, the 
  PCRep message MUST include the corresponding SVEC object directly 
  followed by the OF object, which MUST NOT be repeated for each 
  elementary request. If a metric is applicable to the set of paths, 
  the METRIC object MUST directly follow the SVEC object and MUST NOT 
  be repeated for each elementary request. 
  An OF object specifying an objective function used for an individual 
  path computation (non synchronized case) MUST follow the RP object 
  for which it applies.

  The format of the PCRep message is updated as follows: 
   
  <PCRep Message> ::= <Common Header> 
      [<svec-list>] 
      
       <response-list> 
   
     where: 
   
        <svec-list> ::=<SVEC> 
        [<OF>] 
        [<metric-list>] 
        [<svec-list>] 

        <response-list>::=<response>[<response-list>] 
   
        <response>::=<RP> 
        [<NO-PATH>] 
        [<path-list>] 
   
        <path-list>::=<path>[<path-list>] 
   
        <path>::= <ERO> 
        [<OF>] 
        [<LSPA>] 
        [<BANDWIDTH>] 
        [<metric-list>] 
        [<IRO>] 
     
   where: 
        <metric-list>::=<METRIC>[<metric-list>] 
   

   Note: The OF object MAY be associated to a negative reply, i.e.       
   a reply with a NO-PATH object.  
   
3.3. New RP Object Flag 

  In some cases, where no objective function is specified in the 
  request, or an optional objective function is desired (P flag cleared 
  in the OF object common header) but the PCE does not follow the 
  request, the PCC may desire to know the objective function that was 
  used by the PCE during path computation. To that end, a new flag is 
  defined in the RP object, named the OF flag, allowing a PCC to 
  request for the inclusion in the path computation reply of the 
  objective function that was used by the PCE during path computation. 
   
  The following new bit flag of the RP object is defined:  
   
  Objective Function (OF) flag (1 bit): 0x200 (bit number 16) 
  (suggested value, to be assigned by IANA).  When set in a PCReq 
  message, this indicates that the PCE MUST provide the applied

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-pce-of-03.txt              July 2008 


  objective function (should a path satisfying the constraints be found) 
  in the PCRep message. When set in a PCRep message this indicates that 
  the Objective Function that was used during path computation is 
  included. 
   

3.3.1. Elements Of Procedure 

  If the PCC wants to know the objective function used by the PCE 
  during path computation for a given request, it sets the OF flag in 
  the RP object. 

  On receipt of a PCReq message with the OF flag in the RP object set, 
  the PCE proceeds as follows: 

       - If policy permits it MUST include in the PCRep message an OF  
         object indicating the objective function it used during path  
         computation.  
        
       - If policy does not permit, it MUST send a PCErr message with  
         the PCEP error code "policy-violation" (type 5) and a new  
         error value "objective function indication not allowed"    
         (defined in this document). 
        
4. Objective Functions Definition 
   
  Six objective functions that must be supported by PCEP are listed in 
  [RFC4657]. Objective function codes should be assigned by IANA and 
  are suggested below. 
   
  Objective functions are formulated using the following terminology: 
       - a network comprises a set of N links {Li, (i=1...N)}  
       - a path P is a list of K links {Lpi,(i=1...K)} 
       - metric of link L is noted M(L), this can be the IGP metric the  
         TE metric, or any other metric. 
       - the cost of a path P is noted C(P),  
         C(P) = sum {M(Lpi), (i=1...K)}. 
       - residual bandwidth on link L is noted r(L) 
       - maximum reservable bandwidth on link L is noted R(L). 
   
  There are three objective functions that apply to the computation of 
  a single path: 

  Objective Function Code: 1 (suggested value, to be assigned by IANA) 
  Name: Minimum Cost Path (MCP) 
  Description: Find a path P such that C(P) is minimized.  
   
  Objective Function Code: 2 (suggested value, to be assigned by IANA) 
  Name: Minimum Load Path (MLP) 
  Description: Find a path P such that ( Max {(R(Lpi) - r(Lpi)) / 
  R(Lpi), i=1...K } ) is minimized

Internet Draft         draft-ietf-pce-of-03.txt              July 2008 


  Objective Function Code: 3 (suggested value, to be assigned by IANA) 
  Name: Maximum residual Bandwidth Path (MBP) 
  Description: Find a path P such that ( Min { r(Lpi)), i=1...K } )  is 
  maximized. 

  There are three objective functions that apply to a set of path 
  computation requests the computation of which is synchronized: 
   
  Objective Function Code: 4 (suggested value, to be assigned by IANA) 
  Name: Minimize aggregate Bandwidth Consumption (MBC) 
  Description: Find a set of paths such that ( Sum {R(Li) - r(Li), 
  i=1...N} ) is minimized. 

  Objective Function Code: 5 (suggested value, to be assigned by IANA) 
  Name: Minimize the Load of the most loaded Link (MLL) 
  Description: Find a set of paths such that ( Max { (R(Li) - r(Li)) / 
  R(Li), i=1...N}) is minimized. 

  Objective Function Code: 6 (suggested value, to be assigned by IANA) 
  Name: Minimize the Cumulative Cost of a set of paths (MCC) 
  Description: Find a set of paths {P1...Pm} such that (Sum { C(Pi), 
  i=1...m}) is minimized. 
   
  Other objective functions may be defined in separate documents. 
        

5. New Metric Types 

  Three metric types are defined in PCEP for the METRIC object: TE 
  metric, IGP metric and hop count. These metric types apply to an 
  individual request. Here we define four new metric types that apply 
  to a set of synchronized requests:  
   
  Type 4 (suggested value to be assigned by IANA) : Aggregate bandwidth 
  consumption 
  Type 5 (suggested value to be assigned by IANA) : Load of the most 
  loaded link 
  Type 6 (suggested value to be assigned by IANA) :  Cumulative IGP 
  cost 
  Type 7 (suggested value to be assigned by IANA) :  Cumulative TE cost 
   
  These metrics may be used to indicate a bound (B bit set in the 
  METRIC object) or a computed metric (C bit set in the METRIC object). 
   
  A METRIC object with one of these four types follows the SVEC object 
  for which it applies.

6. IANA Considerations 
   
6.1. PCE Objective Function Sub-registry 
   
  This document defines a 16-bit PCE Objective Function identifier to 
  be carried within the PCEP OF object, as well as the PCEP OF-List TLV.  
   
  IANA is requested to create and manage the 16-bit "PCE Objective 
  Function" code point registry, starting from 1 and continuing through 
  32767, as follows: 
   
  - Objective Function code point value 
  - Objective Function name 
  - Defining RFC 
   
  The same registry is applicable to the OF object and the OF-List TLV 
  defined in this document. 

  The guidelines (using terms defined in [RFC5226]) for the 
  assignment of objective function code point values are as follows: 
   
     - Function code value 0 is reserved. 
     - Function code values in the range 1-32767 are to be assigned as  
       follows: 
           - Function code values 1 through 1023 are to be assigned by 
             IANA using the "IETF Consensus" policy. 
           - Function code values 1024 through 32767 are to be  
             assigned by IANA, using the "First Come First Served"  
             policy. 
      - Function code values in the range 32768-65535 are for  
        "Private Use". 
   
  Six objective functions are defined in Section 4 of this document and 
  should be assigned by IANA:

6.2. PCEP Code Points 
     
6.2.1. OF Object 
   
    The IANA has been requested to manage the PCEP Objects code point 
    registry (see [PCEP]). 
     
    This document defines a new PCEP object, the OF object, to be 
    carried in PCReq and PCRep messages. The IANA is requested to make 
    the following allocation (suggested value): 
     
     Object    Name     Object    Name         Reference 
     Class              Type 
   
       21       OF        1       Objective    (this document) 
                   Function  
      
6.2.2. OF-List TLV 

  IANA is requested to manage the PCEP TLV code point registry (see 
  [PCEP]). 
  This document defines a new PCEP TLV, the OF-List TLV, to be carried 
  in the OPEN object. The IANA is requested to make the following 
  allocation (suggested value): 
   
     Type      TLV name                   References  
     -----     --------                   ----------  
      4         OF-List                   (This document)  

        
6.2.3. PCEP Error values 

   
  Two new error values are defined for the error type "policy 
  violation" (type 5): 
   
   Error-type      Meaning and error values       Reference 
   
      5         Policy violation      
   Error-value=3: objective function not allowed (this doc) 
  (request rejected) 
   Error-value=4: OF bit of the RP object set    (this doc) 
  (request rejected) 


6.2.4. RP Object Flag  
   
  A new flag of the RP object (specified in [PCEP]) is defined in this 
  document. The IANA is requested to make the following allocation 
  (suggested value):

  Number 
    
   16      0x200   OF       (this document) 
   
6.2.5. Metric Types 
   
  Four new metric types are defined in this document for the METRIC 
  object (specified in [PCEP]). The IANA is requested to make the 
  following allocation (suggested values): 

       -Type 4 : Aggregate bandwidth consumption 
       -Type 5 : Load of the most loaded link 
       -Type 6 : Cumulative IGP cost 
       -Type 7 : Cumulative TE cost 
   

7. Security Considerations 

  Mechanisms discussed in [PCEP] to secure a PCEP session can be used to 
  secure the PCEP OF object and OF list TLV as well. 

8. Manageability Considerations 

8.1. Control of Function and Policy 

  It MUST be possible to configure the activation/deactivation of 
  Objective Function Discovery in PCEP. 

  In addition to the parameters already listed in section 8.1 of [PCEP], 
  a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring on a PCE a list of 
  authorized objective functions. This may apply to any session the 
  PCEP speaker participates in, to a specific session with a given PCEP 
  peer or to a specific group of sessions with a specific group of PCEP 
  peers. 
   
  Note that it is not mandatory for an implementation to support all 
  objective functions defined in Section 4. 
   
  It MUST be possible to configure a default objective function used 
  for path computation when a path request is received that requests to 
  use an optional objective function. 

8.2. Information and Data Models 

  The PCEP MIB Module defined in [PCEP-MIB] SHOULD be extended to 
  include Objective Functions.

8.3. Liveness Detection and Monitoring 
   
  Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness 
  detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already 
  listed in [PCEP]. 

8.4. Verify Correct Operations 
   
  Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation 
  verification requirements in addition to those already listed in 
  [PCEP]. 

8.5. Requirements On Other Protocols  
   
  Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any requirements on 
  other protocols in addition to those already listed in [PCEP]. 
   
8.6. Impact On Network Operations 
   
  Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on network 
  operations in addition to those already listed in [PCEP].
