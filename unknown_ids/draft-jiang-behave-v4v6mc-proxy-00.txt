Abstract 

   During the long co-existing period of IPv6 and IPv4, the 
   interoperation between IPv6 network and IPv4 network is essential. 
   Multicast services across IPv6 and IPv4 networks are also needed. 
   Besides the multicast translation mechanism, this document describes 
   a multicast proxy solution. The multicast proxy is deployed at the 
   border of IPv6/IPv4 networks. It acts as a multicast leaf in the 
   network that the data source locates. It also acts as a multicast 
   source in other IP network. Without translation, it multicasts the 
   data retrieved and cached from different IP network.

1. Introduction 

   The confirmation of IPv4 address exhaustion clearly indicates that 
   global IPv6 deployment is inevitably going to happen. However, it is 
   also widely agreed that IPv4 will be still in use for a long period. 
   During the long co-existing period of IPv6 and IPv4, the 
   interoperation between IPv6 network and IPv4 network is essential.  

   Now, multimedia has been deployed widely, such as IPTV and video 
   conference etc. They also face the IPv6 and IPv4 intercommunication 
   issues. The multicast applications are complicated and face more 
   difficulties than unicast applications deployment. 

   [I-D.draft-venaas-behave-v4v6mc-framework] proposes a translation 
   framework between IPv4/IPv6 multicast services. It describes the 
   translation operations and intercommunication in network layer to 
   support a single source send to multiple receivers in different IP 
   networks. 

   Besides the multicast translation mechanism, this document describes 
   a multicast proxy solution, which is conceptually similar to an 
   application-level gateway. 

   A multicast proxy can be deployed at the border between IPv4/IPv6 
   networks. It acts as a multicast leaf in the network that the data 
   source locates. It also acts as a multicast source in other IP 
   network. Without translation, it multicasts the data retrieved and 
   cached from different IP network. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   Figure 1: Multicast proxy Forward Contents to different IP networks 

   As showed in Figure 1, the proposed multicast proxy is deployed at 
   the border of IPv4/IPv6 networks. It MUST support both IPv4 and IPv6. 
   It MUST support both IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol, 
   [RFC3376]), which is used for IPv4 multicast management functions, 
   and MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery, [RFC3810]), which is used in a 
   similar way in IPv6 Environment. In the IPvX network, the multicast 
   proxy joins the multicast distribution tree as a leaf. In the IPvY 
   network, the multicast proxy broadcasts contents as a multicast 
   source. The establishment of multicast distribution trees obeys the 
   current multicast specifications for each IP family, such as Protocol 
   Independent Multicast (PIM [RFC4601]). 

   Notice that there is one multicast distribution tree in each sides of 
   the multicast proxy.  

   Logically, they are relevant to each other and there are 
   interoperation behaviors between them. The contents published through 
   the multicast distribution tree in IPvY network inherits from the 
   IPvX network. They are received by the multicast proxy, which is a 
   multicast leaf in the multicast distribution tree in IPvX network. 
   Within the multicast proxy contents are mapped between receiver 
   function and publisher function. The operations of the multicast 
   distribution tree in IPvY network MAY trigger some operations of the 
   multicast distribution tree in IPvX network. For example, a multicast 
   client joins a multicast group in IPvY network, and requests 
   multicast contents may cause the multicast proxy joins a multicast 
   group in IPvX network. 

   However, in network or IP layer, they are independent from each other. 
   Conceptually, the multicast proxy can be presented virtually like 
   below Figure 2.

3.2. Operation procedure 

   A client, locates in IPvY network, connects to the multicast proxy, 
   requesting a multicast service whose source locates in IPvX network. 
   The multicast proxy maintains a multicast service table, including 
   available multicast services from itself and IPvX network. The 
   multicast proxy searches the client request in its multicast service 
   table. If the requested multicast service is from IPvX network, the 
   multicast proxy connects to the multicast source in IpvX network and 
   requesting the service on behalf of the client. 

   When a second client in IPvY network requests the same multicast 
   service, the multicast proxy can provide the service without any 
   additional operation. 

   If all the clients, requesting a certain multicast service in IPvY 
   network, leave the multicast group in IPvY network, the multicast 
   proxy MAY leave the multicast group in IPvX network. 

   Multicast Proxy MAY also perform load-balancing, authentication and 
   caching functions. 

4. Security Considerations 

   The multicast proxy solution actually separate the IPv4 and IPv6 
   multicast services effectively. It prevents the attacks at only one 
   side of it. 

   However, multicast proxy itself is as vulnerable as normal multicast 
   sources and multicast leafs in each IPv4 or IPv6 environment. The 
   security mechanisms for IGMP/MLD can be used to enhance the security 
   of multicast proxy. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   This draft does not request any IANA action.
