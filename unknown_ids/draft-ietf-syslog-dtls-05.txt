1.  Introduction

   The syslog protocol [RFC5424] is designed to run over different
   transports for different environments.  This document defines the
   transport of syslog messages over the datagram transport layer
   security protocol (DTLS) [RFC4347].

   The datagram transport layer security protocol (DTLS) [RFC4347] is
   designed to meet the requirements of applications that need secure
   datagram transport.  DTLS has been mapped onto different transports,
   including UDP [RFC0768] and DCCP [RFC4340].  This memo defines both
   options, namely syslog over DTLS over UDP and syslog over DTLS over
   DCCP.

2.  Terminology

   The following definitions from [RFC5424] are used in this document:

   o  An "originator" generates syslog content to be carried in a
      message.

   o  A "collector" gathers syslog content for further analysis.

   o  A "relay" forwards messages, accepting messages from originators
      or other relays, and sending them to collectors or other relays.

   o  A "transport sender" passes syslog messages to a specific
      transport protocol.

   o  A "transport receiver" takes syslog messages from a specific
      transport protocol.

   This document adds the following definitions:

   o  A "DTLS client" is an application that can initiate a DTLS Client
      Hello to a server.

   o  A "DTLS server" is an application that can receive a DTLS Client
      Hello from a client and reply with a Server Hello.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Security Requirements for Syslog

   The security requirements for the transport of syslog messages are
   discussed in Section 2 of [RFC5425].  These also apply to this
   specification.

   The following secondary threat is also considered in this document:

   o  Denial of service is discussed in [RFC5424], which states that an
      attacker may send more messages to a transport receiver than the
      transport receiver could handle.  When using a secure transport
      protocol handshake, an attacker may use a spoofed IP source to
      engage the server in a cryptographic handshake to deliberately
      consume the server's resources.

4.  Using DTLS to Secure Syslog

   DTLS can be used as a secure transport to counter all the primary
   threats to syslog described in [RFC5425]:

   o  Confidentiality to counter disclosure of the message contents.

   o  Integrity checking to counter modifications to a message on a hop-
      by-hop basis.

   o  Server or mutual authentication to counter masquerade.

   In addition DTLS also provides:

   o  A cookie exchange mechanism during handshake to counter Denial of
      Service attacks.

   o  A sequence number in the header to counter replay attacks.

   Note: This secure transport (i.e., DTLS) only secures syslog
   transport in a hop-by-hop manner, and is not concerned with the
   contents of syslog messages.  In particular, the authenticated
   identity of the transport sender (e.g., subject name in the
   certificate) is not necessarily related to the HOSTNAME field of the
   syslog message.  When authentication of syslog message origin is
   required, [I-D.ietf-syslog-sign] can be used.

5.  Protocol Elements

5.1.  Transport

   DTLS can run over multiple transports.  Implementations of this
   specification MUST support DTLS over UDP and SHOULD support DTLS over
   DCCP [RFC5238].  Transports, such as UDP or DCCP do not provide
   session multiplexing and session-demultiplexing.  In such cases, the
   application implementer provides this functionality by mapping a
   unique combination of the remote address, remote port number, local
   address and local port number to a session.

   Each syslog message is delivered by the DTLS record protocol, which
   assigns a sequence number to each DTLS record.  Although the DTLS
   implementer may adopt a queue mechanism to resolve reordering, it may
   not assure that all the messages are delivered in order when mapping
   on the UDP transport.

   When DTLS runs over an unreliable transport, such as UDP, reliability
   is not provided.  With DTLS, an originator or relay may not realize
   that a collector has gone down or lost its DTLS connection state so
   messages may be lost.

   Syslog over DTLS over TCP MUST NOT be used.  If a secure transport is
   required with TCP then the appropriate security mechanism is syslog
   over TLS as described in [RFC5425].

5.2.  Port and Service Code Assignment

   A syslog transport sender is always a DTLS client and a transport
   receiver is always a DTLS server.

   The UDP and DCCP port [TBD] has been allocated as the default port
   for syslog over DTLS as defined in this document.  The service code
   [TBD] has been assigned to syslog.

5.3.  Initiation

   The transport sender initiates a DTLS connection by sending a DTLS
   Client Hello to the transport receiver.  Implementations MUST support
   the denial of service countermeasures defined by DTLS.  When these
   countermeasures are enabled, the transport receiver responds with a
   DTLS Hello Verify Request containing a cookie.  The transport sender
   responds with a DTLS Client Hello containing the received cookie
   which initiates the DTLS handshake.  When the DTLS handshake has
   finished, the transport sender MAY then send the first syslog
   message.

Internet-Draft      DTLS Transport Mapping for Syslog           May 2010


   Implementations MUST support DTLS 1.1 [RFC4347] and MUST support the
   mandatory to implement cipher suite, which is
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA.

5.3.1.  Certificate-Based Authentication

   The mandatory to implement ciphersuites for DTLS use certificates
   [RFC5280] to authenticate peers.  Both syslog transport sender (DTLS
   client) and syslog transport receiver (DTLS server) MUST implement
   certificate-based authentication.  This consists of validating the
   certificate and verifying that the peer has the corresponding private
   key.  The latter part is performed by DTLS.  To ensure
   interoperability between clients and servers, the methods for
   certificate validation defined in sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 of
   [RFC5425] SHALL be implemented.

   Both transport receiver and transport sender implementations MUST
   provide means to generate a key pair and self-signed certificate in
   case a key pair and certificate are not available through another
   mechanism.

   The transport receiver and transport sender SHOULD provide mechanisms
   to record the certificate or certificate fingerprint used by the
   remote endpoint for the purpose of correlating an identity with the
   sent or received data.

5.4.  Sending data

   All syslog messages MUST be sent as DTLS "application data".  It is
   possible that multiple syslog messages be contained in one DTLS
   record, or that a syslog message be transferred in multiple DTLS
   records.  The application data is defined with the following ABNF
   [RFC5234] expression:

   APPLICATION-DATA = 1*SYSLOG-FRAME

   SYSLOG-FRAME = MSG-LEN SP SYSLOG-MSG

   MSG-LEN = NONZERO-DIGIT *DIGIT

   SP = %d32

   NONZERO-DIGIT = %d49-57

   DIGIT = %d48 / NONZERO-DIGIT

   SYSLOG-MSG is defined in syslog [RFC5424] protocol.

5.4.1.  Message Size

   The message length is the octet count of the SYSLOG-MSG in the
   SYSLOG-FRAME.  A transport receiver MUST use the message length to
   delimit a syslog message.  There is no upper limit for a message
   length per se.  As stated in [RFC4347], each DTLS record MUST fit
   within a single DTLS datagram.  When mapping onto different
   transports, DTLS has different record size limitations.  The
   application implementer SHOULD determine the maximum record size
   allowed by DTLS protocol running over the transport in use.  The
   message size SHOULD NOT exceed the DTLS maximum record size
   limitation of 2^14 bytes.  To be consistent with RFC 5425, in
   establishing a baseline for interoperability, this specification
   requires that a transport receiver MUST be able to process messages
   with a length up to and including 2048 octets.  Transport receivers
   SHOULD be able to process messages with lengths up to and including
   8192 octets.

5.5.  Closure

   A transport sender MUST close the associated DTLS connection if the
   connection is not expected to deliver any syslog messages later.  It
   MUST send a DTLS close_notify alert before closing the connection.  A
   transport sender (DTLS client) MAY choose to not wait for the
   transport receiver's close_notify alert and simply close the DTLS
   connection.  Once the transport receiver gets a close_notify from the
   transport sender, it MUST reply with a close_notify.

   When no data is received from a DTLS connection for a long time
   (where the application decides what "long" means), a transport
   receiver MAY close the connection.  The transport receiver (DTLS
   server) MUST attempt to initiate an exchange of close_notify alerts
   with the transport sender before closing the connection.  Transport
   receivers that are unprepared to receive any more data MAY close the
   connection after sending the close_notify alert.

   Although closure alerts form part of DTLS, they, like all alerts, are
   not retransmitted by DTLS and so may be lost over an unreliable
   network.

6.  Congestion Control

   Because syslog can generate unlimited amounts of data, transferring
   this data over UDP is generally problematic, because UDP lacks
   congestion control mechanisms.  Congestion control mechanisms that
   respond to congestion by reducing traffic rates and establish a
   degree of fairness between flows that share the same path are vital
   to the stable operation of the Internet (see [RFC2914] and
   [RFC5405]).

   DCCP has congestion control.  For this reason the syslog over DTLS
   over DCCP option is recommended in preference to the syslog over the
   DTLS over UDP option.  Implementations of syslog over DTLS over DCCP
   MUST support CCID 3 and SHOULD support CCID 2 to ensure
   interoperability.

   The congestion control considerations from section 4.3 of [RFC5426]
   also apply to syslog over DTLS over udp.

7.  Security Policies

   Syslog transport over DTLS has been designed to minimize the security
   and operational differences for environments where both [RFC5425] and
   syslog over DTLS are supported.  The security policies for syslog
   over DTLS are the same as those described in [RFC5425].

8.  IANA Consideration

   IANA is requested to assign a registered UDP and DCCP port number for
   syslog over DTLS.  The same value as for syslog over TLS (6514) is
   requested.

   IANA is requested to assign the service code SYLG to syslog for use
   with DCCP.  The allocation in the service code registry should be as
   follows:

9.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC5425], [RFC5246] and [RFC4347]
   apply to this document.

9.1.  DTLS Renegotiation

   TLS and DTLS renegotiation may be vulnerable to attacks described in
   [RFC5746].  Although RFC 5746 provides a fix for some of the issues,
   renegotiation can still cause problems for applications since
   connection security parameters can change without the application
   knowing it.  Therefore it is RECOMMENDED that renegotiation be
   disabled for syslog over DTLS.  If renegotiation is allowed then the
   specification in RFC 5746 MUST be followed and the implementation
   MUST make sure that the connection still has adequate security and
   that any identities extracted from client and server certificates do
   not change during renegotiation.
