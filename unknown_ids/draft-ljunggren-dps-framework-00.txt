   secondary level, who have deployed DNSSEC.  DNSSEC is a set of
   security extensions to the DNS that allows validating DNS answers by
   to establishing a 'chains of trust' from known public keys to the
   data being validated.

   The aim of this framework is to describe an overall policy for
   serving secured DNS data and key management.  In particular, the
   framework provides a comprehensive list of topics that potentially
   (at the writer's discretion) needs to be covered in a DNSSEC policy
   definition and practice statement.

Internet-Draft                DPS framework                    July 2009


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   This document has been heavily inspired by RFC 3647 [RFC3647].

1.2.  Purpose

   The purpose of this document is twofold.  First, the document aims to
   explain the concept of a DPS and describe the relationship between
   the registry and the relying parties.  Second, this document aims to
   present a framework to assist the writers of DPSs in creating
   comparable policies and practices.  In particular, the framework
   identifies the elements that may need to be considered in formulating
   a DPS.  The purpose is not to define a particular policy or practice,
   per se.  Moreover, this document does not aim to provide legal advice
   or recommendations as to particular requirements or practices that
   should be contained within DPSs.

1.3.  Scope


2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Concepts

3.1.  DNSSEC

3.2.  Signing policy and practice statement

3.3.  Relationship between policy and practice statement

3.4.  Set of provisions


4.  Contents of a set of provisions


5.  Outline of a set of provisions
