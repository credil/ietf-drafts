     Simple Mail Transfer Protocol extension for Message Priorities
                    draft-melnikov-smtp-priority-03

Abstract

   This memo defines an extension to the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer
   Protocol) service whereby messages are sent with a priority to enable
   the receiving MTA (Message Transfer Agent) to take this into account
   for onward processing, with the general goal of processing and/or
   transferring higher priority messages first.

Internet-Draft    SMTP Extension for Message Priorities    November 2011


1.  Introduction

   Where resources for switching or transfer of messages are constrained
   (e.g., bandwidth, round trip time or processing capability) it is
   desirable to process high priority messages first.  This is
   particularly important during emergencies for first responders and
   for environments such as military messaging, where messages have high
   operational significance, and the consequences of extraneous delay
   can be significant.

   In order for an MTA to be able to send higher priority messages
   first, there needs to be a mechanism to communicate (during both
   Message Submission [RFC4409] and Message Transfer [RFC5321]) the
   priority of each message.  This specification defines this mechanism
   by specification of an SMTP [RFC5321] extension.  It also enables
   communication of message priority through MTAs that are not priority
   aware, by the specification of a new message header field [RFC5322].

   Various MUAs already use various other header field that convey
   similar meaning such as message importance.  Example of such header
   fields are Importance [RFC2156], Priority [RFC2156] and X-Priority
   (undocumented).  Considering subtle differences in the meaning of
   these header fields and widely different syntax, this document
   defines a new header field.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The formal syntax use the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234]
   notation including the core rules defined in Appendix B of RFC 5234
   [RFC5234].

   This document uses the term "priority" in the meaning of expedited
   treatment of a message by the server according to the message's
   priority.

   This document uses the phrase "an email is waiting to be sent", if it
   resides in the outbound queue of an MTA and can be sent to the next
   hop or delivered to its final recipient(s) once available resources
   at the sending MTA allow this.  Emails having their processing
   delayed for some reason within the MTA are NOT waiting to be sent
   during this delay.  The most important reason for emails to be
   delayed is a transient error response from the next MTA to which the
   email must be transferred.

   This document uses the phrase "an email is ready to be sent", if it
   is waiting to be sent and either no emails with higher priority are
   waiting to be sent or available resources allow more emails to be
   sent in parallel than the number of emails with higher priorities
   that are waiting to be sent.  Note that an email may be ready to be
   sent but the transfer or delivery process can not yet be initiated,
   because the number of emails ready to be sent exceeds the number of
   emails that can be processed in parallel.

3.  Definition of the Priority SMTP Extension

   The following service extension is defined:

   1.  The textual name of this extension is "Priority Message
       Handling".

   2.  The EHLO keyword value associated with this extension is
       "PRIORITY".

   3.  No parameter values are defined for this EHLO keyword value.  In
       order to permit future (although unanticipated) extensions, the
       EHLO response MUST NOT contain any parameters for that keyword.
       Clients MUST ignore any parameters; that is, clients MUST behave
       as if the parameters do not appear.

   4.  No additional SMTP verbs are defined by this extension.

   5.  One optional parameter ("PRIORITY") is added to the MAIL command.
       The value associated with this parameter is a decimal integer
       number from -99 to 99 indicating the priority of the email
       message.  The syntax of the PRIORITY parameter is described by
       the <priority-value> ABNF non-terminal defined in Section 6.
       Higher numbers mean higher priority.

   6.  The maximum length of a MAIL command line is increased by 13
       characters by the possible addition of the PRIORITY keyword and
       value.

   7.  The PRIORITY extension is valid for the submission service
       [RFC4409] and LTMP [RFC2033].

4.  Handling of messages received via SMTP

   This section describes how a conforming MTA should handle any
   messages received via SMTP.

4.1.  Handling of the PRIORITY parameter by the receiving SMTP server

   The following rules apply to SMTP transactions in which the PRIORITY
   parameter is used:

   1.  A conforming SMTP server SHOULD NOT refuse a MAIL command based
       on the absence of the PRIORITY parameter.  However, if any of the
       associated esmtp-values are not syntactically valid, or if there
       is more than one PRIORITY parameter in a particular MAIL command,
       the server MUST return an error, for example "501 syntax error in
       parameter" (with 5.5.2 Enhanced Status Code [RFC2034]).

   Additionally, when inserting a Received header field as specified in
   Section 4.4 of [RFC5321], the compliant MTA/MSA SHOULD include the
   "PRI" clause which syntax is specified in Section 6.

4.2.  Determining priority of a message

   An SMTP server compliant with this specification can determine the
   priority of a received message as follows:

   1.  If the sending SMTP client specified the PRIORITY parameter to
       the MAIL command, then the value of this parameter is the message
       priority.

   2.  If the sending SMTP client hasn't specified the PRIORITY
       parameter to the MAIL command, but the message has a single
       syntactically valid MT-Priority header field, then the value of
       this header field is the message priority.

   3.  Otherwise (if no PRIORITY parameter to the MAIL command was
       specified and the message doesn't contain a syntactically valid
       MT-Priority header field, or contains multiple MT-Priority header
       fields) the message has priority 0.

   Other message header fields, such as Importance [RFC2156], Priority
   [RFC2156] and X-Priority, MUST NOT be used for determining the
   priority under this "Priority Message Handling" SMTP extension.

   The SMTP server SHOULD ignore or downgrade priorities from untrusted
   (e.g. unauthenticated) or insufficiently trusted sources.
   Alternatively an SMTP server MAY reject a message based on the
   determined priority.  If the latter case, the server SHOULD use 450,
   455 or 550 reply code.  The corresponding enhanced status code MUST
   be X.7.TBD1 [RFC2034] if the determined priority level is below the
   lowest priority acceptable for the receiving SMTP server.

   Additionally, Mail Submission Agent (MSA) MAY alter the message

Internet-Draft    SMTP Extension for Message Priorities    November 2011


   priority (both to lower or to upper it) in order to enforce sender
   domain policy.

4.3.  Relay of messages to other conforming SMTP servers

   The following rules govern the behavior of a conforming MTA (in the
   role of an SMTP client), when relaying a message which was received
   via the SMTP protocol, to an SMTP server that supports the PRIORITY
   SMTP extension:

   1.  A PRIORITY parameter with the value determined by the procedure
       from Section 4.2 MUST appear in the MAIL command issued when the
       message is relayed.  (For example, once an MTA accepts a message,
       the MTA MUST NOT change a (syntactically valid) priority value if
       the MTA doesn't support it.)

   2.  Further processing of the PRIORITY parameter is described in
       Section 5.

4.4.  Relay of messages to non-conforming SMTP servers

   The following rules govern the behavior of a conforming MTA (in the
   role of an SMTP client), when relaying a message which was received
   via the SMTP protocol, to an SMTP server that does not support the
   PRIORITY SMTP extension:

   1.  A PRIORITY parameter MUST NOT appear in the MAIL command issued
       when relaying the message.

   2.  The relaying MTA MUST remove any and all existing MT-Priority
       header fields from the message, and then add its own MT-Priority
       header field with the value determined by the procedure in
       Section 4.2.  Syntax of the MT-Priority header field is specified
       in Section 6.

4.5.  Mailing lists and Aliases

   Several options exist to translate the address of an email recipient
   into one or more other addresses.  Examples for this are aliases and
   mailing lists [RFC5321].

   If a recipient address is to be translated and/or expanded when
   delivered to an alias or a mailing list, the translating or expanding
   entity (maillist manager, MTA etc.)  SHOULD retain the original
   priority for all expanded and/or translated addresses.

Internet-Draft    SMTP Extension for Message Priorities    November 2011


4.6.  Gatewaying a message into a foreign environment

   The following rules govern the behavior of a conforming MTA, when
   gatewaying a message that was received via the SMTP protocol, into a
   foreign (non-SMTP) environment:

   1.  If the destination environment is unable to provide an equivalent
       of the PRIORITY parameter, the conforming MTA SHOULD behave as if
       it is relaying to a non-conformant SMTP (Section 4.4).

   2.  If the destination environment is capable of providing an
       equivalent of the PRIORITY parameter, the conforming MTA SHOULD
       behave as if it is relaying to a conformant SMTP (Section 4.3),
       converting the PRIORITY parameter to the equivalent in the
       destination environment.

4.7.  Interaction with DSN SMTP Extension

   An MTA which also conforms to [RFC3461] SHOULD apply the same
   priority value to delivery reports (whether for successful delivery
   or failed delivery) it generates for a message.

5.  The Priority Service Extension

   The priorities of messages affect the order the messages are
   transfered from the client to the server.  This is largely
   independent from the order in which they were originally received by
   the server.

   An SMTP server compliant with this specification MUST be able to
   support at least 6 distinct priority levels (from -99 to -40, from
   -39 to -20, from -19 to 0, from 1 to 20, from 21 to 40, from 41 to
   99).  However even when only implementing the 6 priority levels it
   MUST treat other syntactically valid priority values as valid and MAY
   map them internally to the next supported priority values higher than
   the value, or to the priority 60 for all values above 40.
   Irrespectively on the number of distinct priority levels supported by
   the SMTP server, when relaying the message to the next hop or
   delivering it over LMTP, the SMTP server MUST comminicate the
   priority value as determined in Section 4.2.

   The Priority Service Extension can be combined with DELIVERBY
   [RFC2852] SMTP service extension, however there is no requirement
   that both extensions are always implemented together.

   Some SMTP servers MAY impose additional maximum message size
   contraints for different message priorities, for example messages
   with priority 60 might not be larger than 4 Kb.  If an SMTP server

Internet-Draft    SMTP Extension for Message Priorities    November 2011


   chooses to reject a message because it is too big for the determined
   priority, it SHOULD use 552 or 554 reply codes, together with the
   X.3.TBD2 enhanced status code [RFC2034].

5.1.  Expedited Transfer

   The main service provided by the Priority Message Handling SMTP
   Service Extension is expedited transfer of emails with a higher
   priority.  Therefore an SMTP client that has more than one email to
   send at a given time SHOULD send those with a higher priority before
   those with a lower one.  Additionally, the retry interval and/or
   default timeout before non-delivery report is generated MAY be lower
   (more aggressive) for messages of higher priority.

   In order to make implementations of this extension easier, this SMTP
   extension only allows a single priority for all recipients of the
   same message.

   As a default policy, emails with higher priority waiting to be sent
   by a client SHOULD NOT initiate transactions for emails with lower
   priorites.  If two or more emails with the same priority are ready to
   be sent at the same time, the MTA should use its regular algorithm
   (the algorithm used in absence of this SMTP extension) for deciding
   how to send them out.

   In networks with limited available bandwidth or long round trip times
   the actual message transfer over the network may create a significant
   portion of the overall message delivery time from a sender to a
   recipient.  Besides the actions taken at the application level it can
   thus be important to deploy priority or precedence mechanisms offered
   by the network itself to ensure timely delivery of the emails.
   Examples would be the use of DiffServ [RFC2474], RSVP [RFC2205] and
   the work-in-progress effort extension to RSVP that prioritizes
   reservations.

   Most current SMTP MTAs are capable of handling several inbound and
   outbound connections at once.  With this feature it should be
   possible to start additional outbound connections for emails with
   higher priorities even if there are already several connections
   running for other emails.  Two possible ways of implementing
   expedited transfer are described in more details in subsections of
   this section.

5.1.1.  Probability

   This section is Informative.

   As the name suggests, probability involves increasing the chances of



Melnikov & Carlberg       Expires May 25, 2012                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    SMTP Extension for Message Priorities    November 2011


   obtaining resources without adversely affecting previously
   established connections.  One example would involve requesting
   resources set aside for specific priority levels.  If these
   additional resources are exhausted, then the desired connection is
   denied.  Queues, new timers, or combinations thereof can be used to
   facilitate the higher priority requests, but the key is that
   mechanisms focus on increasing the probability of message transfer.

5.1.2.  Preemption of sessions or transactions

   This section is Informative.

   Preemption is a type of action that focusses only on a comparision of
   priorities to determine if previously established transactions must
   be displaced in favor of higher priority requests.  If no additional
   connection is possible, the client aborts a running session for
   emails with lower priority no later than directly after the current
   transaction.  The client even can interrupt an active transaction and
   should do so, if other constraints such as delivery time (as
   specified in the DELIVERBY SMTP extension [RFC2852]) would be
   violated for the email with higher priority.  When interrupting an
   active transaction, the client should take the total message size and
   the size of the transferred portion of the message being interrupted
   into consideration.  This preliminary termination of sessions or
   transactions is called preemption.

   If preemption of running transactions occurs, the client must choose
   a transaction with the lowest priority currently processed.

   If the client has an option (i.e. it is supported by the next hop
   MTA) to interrupt transactions in a way that it can be restarted at
   the interruption point later, it should deploy it.  An example for a
   mechanism providing such a service is the "SMTP Service Extension for
   Checkpoint/Restart" defined in [RFC1845].

   If a client opts for the preemption of sessions instead of
   transactions, it must preempt the next session that reaches the end
   of a transaction.

5.2.  Timely Delivery

   An important constraint (usually associated with higher priority
   levels) is, that messages with that priority have to reach its
   destination within a defined period of time.  In some cases, higher
   priorities mean shorter maximum allowed time of delivery.

   Unextended SMTP does not offer a service for timely delivery.  The
   "Deliver By SMTP Service Extension" (DELIVERBY Extension) defined in



Melnikov & Carlberg       Expires May 25, 2012                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    SMTP Extension for Message Priorities    November 2011


   [RFC2852] is an example of an SMTP extension providing a service that
   can be used to implement such constraints.

6.  Syntax

      priority-header-field = "MT-Priority:"
                              [CFWS] priority-value [CFWS] CRLF

      priority-value = (["-"] NZDIGIT [DIGIT]) / "0"
                       ; Allowed values are from -99 to 99 inclusive

      NZDIGIT = %x31-39
                ; "1"-"9"

      CFWS = <defined in RFC 5322>

      Pri  = CFWS "PRI" FWS priority-value
                ; Complies with the <Additional-Registered-Clauses>
                ; non-terminal syntax from RFC 5321.

7.  Example

   An original SMTP transaction with 2 recipients.  Note that the
   example is also making use of the DELIVERBY [RFC2852] and DSN
   [RFC3461] SMTP extensions, even thought there is no requirement that
   these other extensions are to be supported when the PRIORITY SMTP
   extension is implemented.

        S: 221 goodbye

   If the receiving SMTP server only supports 6 priority levels as
   described in Section 5, it will use the priority value 40 internally
   and will communicate the priority value 38 when relaying it to the
   next hop (if necessary).

8.  Open Issues/ToDo

   [[anchor15: This section should be removed before publication]]

   Open Issue: Tunneling of priority information through non conforming
   MTAs - is this something that should be standardized?  (Preference:
   yes)

   Open Issue: Advertise maximum message sizes per priority in the EHLO
   capability?

9.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requests IANA to add the PRIORITY SMTP extension
   to the list of supported SMTP Extensions.

   IANA is also requested to add the following list of header fields to
   the list of Permanent Message Header Fields to be used by the "mail"
   protocol:

   Header field: MT-Priority
   Applicable protocol: mail
   Status: standard
   Author/change controller: Alexey Melnikov / IETF (iesg@ietf.org)
   Specification document(s): [[anchor17: this document]]

   This specification requests IANA to add the following new Received
   header field clause to help with tracing email messages delivered
   using the PRIORITY SMTP extension:

   Clause name: PRI
   Description: Records the value of the PRIORITY parameter specified in
   the MAIL command
   Syntax of the value: See Section 6 of RFCXXXX
   Reference: [[anchor18: RFCXXXX]]

Internet-Draft    SMTP Extension for Message Priorities    November 2011


   1.  X.7.TBD1 - the determined priority level is below the minimal
       priority level acceptable for the receiving SMTP server

   2.  X.3.TBD2 - Message is too big for the specified priority

10.  Security Considerations

   This document allows a message priority to be tunneled through MTAs
   which don't support the PRIORITY SMTP extension by specifying how it
   can be represented in the message itself (using the MT-Priority
   header field).  Thus it is important to ensure that an MTA receiving
   a message containing the MT-Priority header field can trust that it
   was set by an authorized agent.

   Message Submission Agents can implement a policy that only allows
   authenticated users (or only certain groups of authenticated users)
   to specify message priorities (whether by using the PRIORITY
   parameter to the MAIL command or the MT-Priority header field in the
   message itself), and to restrict maximum priority values different
   groups of users can request, or override the priority values
   specified by MUAs.  Such MSAs SHOULD strip any MT-Priority header
   field values that don't satisfy this policy.  See Section 10.1 for
   more details on when violation of this SHOULD is warranted.

   In the absence of the policy enforcement mentioned above a server
   implementing this extension might be susceptible to a Denial of
   Service attack.  For example, malicious clients can try to abuse this
   feature by always requesting Priority 99.

   To protect MT-Priority header field from modification or insertion,
   MUAs, MSAs and MTAs inserting it into messages SHOULD use message
   header protection mechanism such as DKIM [RFC4871].  But see
   Section 10.1.

10.1.  Modification of MT-Priority header field and DKIM

   A MSA/MTA that receives a message with an MT-Priority header field
   protected by DKIM, that wants to change the message priority due to
   its policy is forced to choose between a) breaking DKIM signatures
   (by replacing the MT-Priority header value), b) leaving the message
   as is, relying on the fact that all downstream MTAs are compliant
   with this specification, or c) rejecting the message.  All of these
   choices have pros and cons, which should be carefully considered
   during deployment.

   If the MSA/MTA decides to alter the message, it SHOULD re-sign the
   message with DKIM.

Appendix A.  Mapping of PRIORITY parameter values for Military Messaging

   Military Messaging as specified in STANAG 4406 defines six priority
   values.  Where SMTP is used to support military messaging, the
   following mappings SHOULD be used.

              Recommended mapping of PRIORITY values for MMHS

                      +----------------+-----------+
                      | Priority value | MMHS name |
                      +----------------+-----------+
                      |       -40      | Deferred  |
                      |       -20      | Routine   |
                      |        0       | Priority  |
                      |       20       | Immediate |
                      |       40       | Flash     |
                      |       60       | Override  |

Appendix B.  Mapping of PRIORITY parameter values for MIXER

   MIXER [RFC2156] defines the Priority header field with 3 values.
   Where SMTP is used to support military messaging, the following
   mappings SHOULD be used.

Appendix C.  Mapping of National Security / Emergency Preparedness
             (NS/EP) Values

   Communication systems used during an emergency or disaster are
   realized in several forms.  The most well known form involves the
   many-to-one model of the general public contacting a public safety
   access point via 911/999/112 calls through the public telephone
   network.  Typically, these calls do not require authorization, nor do
   they invoke any prioritization.

   Another form of emergency communications involves a set of authorized
   users or nodes that use prioritized services to help established and
   continue communication given limited available resources.  [RFC4190]
   includes descriptions of several systems that have been developed to
   support National Security / Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP).  These
   deployed systems require a form of authentication and have focused on
   prioritization of telephony based services.  They have also been
   designed as a binary form (on/off) of signaled priority
   communications.

   [RFC4412] includes examples of a more expansive view of NS/EP
   communications in which priority migrates from a single on/off bit
   value to one that comprises five priority values.  This is shown in
   the cases of the ETS and WPS Namespaces.  Given a lack of pre-
   existing NS/EP values assigned for email, we follow the paradigm of
   the ETS and WPS Namespaces and recommend five ascending values shown
   in the table below.

                   +----------------+------------------+
                   | Priority value | Relational Order |
                   +----------------+------------------+
                   |       -20      | Lowest Priority  |
                   |        0       | ----------       |
                   |       20       | ----------       |
                   |       40       | ----------       |

   As in the case of Appendix A and B, the gap in numeric values listed
   in this table provides room for future changes to expand the set of
   priorities at a future date, or in a local and non-standardized
   manner.
