Abstract

   The GMPLS controlled Ethernet Label Switching (GELS) work is
   extending GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the establishment of Ethernet
   LSPs.  IEEE Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) specifies an
   adjunct OAM flow to check connectivity in Ethernet networks.  CFM can
   be also used with Ethernet LSPs for fault detection and triggering
   recovery mechanisms.  The ITU-T Y.1731 specification builds on CFM
   and specifies additional OAM mechanisms, including Performance
   Monitoring, for Ethernet networks.  This document specifies
   extensions of GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the setup of the associated
   Ethernet OAM (CFM and Y.1731) entities adding a technology specific
   TLV to [OAM-CONF-FWK].

1.  Background

   Provider Backbone Bridging - Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE)
   [IEEE-PBBTE] decouples the Ethernet data and control planes by
   explicitly supporting external control/management mechanisms to
   configure static filtering entries in bridges and create explicitly
   routed Ethernet connections.  In addition PBB-TE defines mechanisms
   for 1:1 protection switching of bidirectional Ethernet connections.

   Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) defines an adjunct
   connectivity monitoring OAM flow to check the liveliness of Ethernet
   networks [IEEE-CFM].  With PBB-TE Ethernet networks will support
   explicitly-routed Ethernet connections.  CFM can be used to track the
   liveliness of PBB-TE connections and detect data plane failures.

   In IETF the GMPLS controlled Ethernet Label Switching (GELS)
   [GELS-Framework] work is extending the GMPLS control plane to support
   the establishment of point-to-point PBB-TE data plane connections.
   We refer to GMPLS established PBB-TE connections as Ethernet LSPs.
   GELS enables the application of MPLS-TE and GMPLS provisioning and
   recovery features in Ethernet networks.

2.  Overview of Ethernet OAM operation in PBB-TE networks

   For the purposes of this document, we only discuss Ethernet OAM
   [IEEE-CFM] aspects that are relevant for the connectivity monitoring
   of point-to-point PBB-TE connections.

   PBB-TE [IEEE-PBBTE] defines point-to-point Ethernet Switched Paths
   (ESPs) as a provisioned traffic engineered unidirectional
   connectivity, identified by the 3-tuple [ESP-MAC DA, ESP-MAC SA, ESP-
   VID] where the ESP-MAC DA is the destination address of the ESP, the
   ESP-MAC SA is the source address of the ESP, and the ESP-VID is a
   VLAN identifier allocated for explicitly routed connections.  To form
   a bidirectional PBB-TE connection two co-routed point-to-point ESPs
   are combined.  The combined ESPs must have the same ESP-MAC addresses
   but may have different ESP-VIDs.

   Note that although it would be possible to use GMPLS to setup a
   single unidirectional ESP, the Ethernet OAM mechanisms are only full
   functional when bidirectional connections are established with co-
   routed ESPs.  Hence, we focus on bidirectional point-to-point PBB-TE
   connections.

   At both ends of the bidiretional point-to-point PBB-TE connection one
   Maintenance Endpoint (MEP) is configured.  The MEPs monitoring a
   PBB-TE connection must be configured with the same Maintenance Domain
   Level (MD Level) and Maintenance Association Identifier (MAID).  Each
   MEP has a unique identifier, the MEP ID.  Besides these identifiers a
   MEP monitoring a PBB-TE connection must be provisioned with the
   3-tuples [ESP-MAC DA, ESP-MAC SA, ESP-VID] of the two ESPs.

   MEPs exchange Connectivity Check Messages (CCMs) periodically with
   fixed intervals.  Eight distinct intervals are defined in [IEEE-CFM]:

                      Table 1: CCM Interval encoding

   If 3 consecutive CCM messages are not received by one of the MEPs it
   declares a connectivity failure and signals the failure in subsequent
   CCM messages, by setting the Remote Defect Indicator (RDI) bit, to
   the remote MEP.  If a MEP receives a CCM message with RDI set it
   immediately declares failure.  The detection of a failure may trigger
   protection switching mechanisms or may be signalled to a management
   system.  However, what happens once a failure is detected is out of
   the scope of this document.

3.  GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions

3.1.  Operation overview

   To simplify the configuration of connectivity monitoring, when an
   Ethernet LSP is signalled the associated MEPs should be automatically
   established.  To monitor an Ethernet LSP a set of parameters must be
   provided to setup a Maintenance Association and related MEPs.

   o  A unique MAID must be allocated for the PBB-TE connection and both
      MEPs must be configured with the same information.  The MAID
      consists of an optional Maintenance Domain Name (MD Name) and a
      mandatory Short Maintenance Association Name (Short MA Name).
      Various formating rules for these names have been defined by
      [IEEE-CFM].  Since these information is also carried in all CCM
      messages, the combined length of the Names is limited to 44 bytes.
      How these parameters are determined is out of scope of this
      document.

   o  Each MEP must be provisioned with a MEP ID.  The MEP ID uniquely
      identifies a given MEP within a Maintenance Association.  That is,
      the combination of MAID and MEP ID must uniquely identify a MEP.
      How the value of the MEP ID is determined is out of scope of this
      document.

   o  The Maintenance Domain Level (MD Level) allows hierarchical
      separation of monitoring entities.  [IEEE-CFM] allows
      differentiation of 8 levels.  How the value of the MD Level is
      determined is out of scope of this document.  Note that most
      probably for all Ethernet LSPs a single (default) MD Level will be
      used.

   o  The desired CCM Interval must be specified by the management
      system based on service requirements or operator policy.  The same
      CCM Interval must be set in each of the MEPs monitoring a given
      Ethernet LSP.  How the value of the CCM Interval is determined is
      out of scope of this document.

   o  The desired CCM priority to be set by MEPs for the CCM frames can
      be specified.  The same CCM priority must be set in each of the
      MEPs monitoring a given Ethernet LSP.  How CCM priority is
      determined is out of scope of this document.

   o  MEPs must be aware of their own and the reachability parameters of
      the remote MEP.  In the case of bidirectional point-to-point
      PBB-TE connections this requires that the 3-tuples [ESP-MAC A,
      ESP-MAC B, ESP-VID1] and [ESP-MAC B, ESP-MAC A, ESP-VID2] are
      configured in each MEP, where the ESP-MAC A is the same as the



Takacs, et al.            Expires June 26, 2009                 [Page 8]

      local MEP's MAC and ESP-MAC B is the same as remote MEP's MAC.
      The GMPLS Ethernet Label for forwarding, as defined in
      [GELS-PBBTE], consists of the ESP-MAC DA and ESP-VID.  Hence the
      necessary reachability parameters for the MEPs can be obtained
      from Ethernet Labels (i.e., carried in the "downstream" and
      upstream labels).

   Assuming the procedures described in [GELS-PBBTE] for bidirectional
   Ethernet LSP establishment the MEP configuration should be as
   follows.  When the RSVP-TE signalling is initiated for the
   bidirectional Ethernet LSP the local node generates a Path message
   and:

   o  Allocates an Upstream Label from its MAC address (ESP-MAC A) and
      locally selected VID (ESP-VID1), that it would like to use to
      receive traffic;

   o  Inserts an Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES
      object, specifying the CCM Interval and MD Level;

   o  Adds an MD Name Sub-TLV (optional) and a Short MA Name Sub-TLV to
      the Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV, that will unambiguously
      identify a Maintenance Association for this specific PBB-TE
      connection.  Note that values for these parameters may be derived
      from the GMPLS LSP identification parameters;

   o  Adds a MEP ID Sub-TLV to the Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV.  It
      selects two distinct integer values to identify the local and
      remote MEPs within the Maintenance Association created for
      monitoring of the point-to-point PBB-TE connection.

   Once the remote node receives the Path message it can use the
   UPSTREAM_LABEL to extract the reachability information of the
   initiator.  Then it allocates a LABEL by selecting the MAC address
   (ESP-MAC B) and VID (ESP-VID2) it would like to use to receive
   traffic.  These parameters determine the reachability information of
   the local MEP.  That is, the 3-tuples [ESP-MAC A, ESP-MAC B, ESP-
   VID1] and [ESP-MAC B, ESP-MAC A, ESP-VID2] are derived from the
   Ethernet Labels.  In addition the information received in the
   Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV is used to configure the local MEP.

   Once the Resv message successfully arrives to the initiator it can
   extract the remote side's reachability information from the LABEL
   object whereby this node has also obtained all the information needed
   to establish its local MEP.

   Once the MEPs are established the monitoring of the LSP is
   operational.  In certain situations, e.g., maintenance, re-

   optimisation of LSPs, it is desirable to explicitly enable or disable
   the monitoring of LSPs (i.e., start/stop exchanging CC messages).  To
   allow administrative control of LSP monitoring the "Monitoring
   Disabled" (M) bit in the ADMIN_STATUS Object is used [OAM-CONF-FWK].

3.2.  OAM Configuration TLV

   This TLV is specified in [OAM-CONF-FWK] and is used to select which
   OAM technology/method should be used for the LSP.  In this document a
   new OAM Type: Ethernet OAM is defined.


       OAM Type           Description
     ------------      ------------------

         1                Ethernet OAM
       2-256              Reserved


   The receiving node when the Ethernet OAM Type is requested should
   look for the corresponding technology specific Ethernet OAM
   configuration TLV.

3.3.  Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV

   The Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV (depicted below) is defined for
   Ethernet OAM specific configuration parameters.  The Ethernet OAM
   Configuration TLV is carried in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object in Path
   messages.  This new TLV accommodates generic Ethernet OAM information
   and carries sub-TLVs.

   Type: 2, Short MA Name Sub-TLV (IANA)

   Length: indicates the total length of the TLV including padding.

   Format: according to [IEEE-CFM].

   Name Length: the length of the MA Name field in bytes.  This is
   necessary to allow non 4 byte padded MA Name lengths.

   Short MA Name: variable length field formatted according to the
   format specified in the Format field.

   If an undefined Format is specified an error must be generated: "OAM
   Problem/Unknown MA Name Format".  Also the combined length of MD Name
   and Short MA Name must be less or equal to 44bytes, if this is
   violated an error must be generated: "OAM Problem/Name Length
   Problem".  Note that it is allowed to have no MD Name, in this case
   the MA Name must uniquely identify a Maintenance Association.

3.3.3.  MEP ID Sub-TLV

   The MEP ID Sub-TLV is depicted below.

   Type: 3, MEP ID Sub-TLV (IANA)

   Length: indicates the total length of the TLV including padding.

   Local MEP ID: a 16 bit integer value in the range 1-8191 of the MEP
   ID on the initiator side.

   Remote MEP ID: a 16 bit integer value in the range 1-8191 of the MEP
   ID to be set for the MEP established at the receiving side.  This
   value is determined by the initiator node.  This is possible, since a
   new MAID is assigned to each PBB-TE connection, and MEP IDs must be
   only unique within the scope of the MAID.

   Two flags are defined Transmit (T) and Receive (R).  When T is set
   the corresponding MEP must send OAM packets.  When R is set the
   corresponding MEP must expect to receive OAM packets.  These flags
   are used to configure the role of MEPs.

3.3.4.  Continuity Check (CC) Sub-TLV

   The Continuity Check (CC) sub-TLV is depicted below.

   | Prio  | CCM I |           Reserved (set to all 0s)            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Prio: Indicates the priority to be set for CCM frames.  In Ethernet 3
   bits carried in VLAN TAGs identify priority information.

   CCM I (CCM Interval): CCM Interval, according to the 3 bit encoding
   [IEEE-CFM] shown in Table 1.  If a node does not support the
   requested CCM Interval an error must be generated: "OAM Problem/
   Unsupported CC Interval".

3.4.  Ethernet OAM configuration errors

   In addition to error values specified in [OAM-CONF-FWK] this document
   defines the following values for the "OAM Problem" Error Code.

   o  If a node does not support a specific CFM version an error must be
      generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported OAM Version".

Internet-Draft   GMPLS based Ethernet OAM Configuration    December 2008


   o  If a node does not support a specific MD Level an error must be
      generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported OAM Level".

   o  If an undefined MD name format is specified an error must be
      generated: "OAM Problem/Unknown MD Name Format".

   o  If an undefined MA name format is specified an error must be
      generated: "OAM Problem/Unknown MA Name Format".

   o  If the combined length of MD Name and Short MA Name must be less
      or equal to 44bytes, if this is violated an error must be
      generated: "OAM Problem/Name Length Problem".

   o  If a node does not support the requested CCM Interval an error
      must be generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported CC Interval".

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies a new Ethernet OAM Configuration TLV to be
   carried in the OAM Configuration TLV in LSP_ATTRIBUTES and
   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES objects in Path messages.

   The following values need to be assigned under the Error Code: "OAM
   Problem": "Unsupported OAM Version", "Unsupported OAM Level",
   "Unknown MD Name Format", "Unknown MA Name Format", "Name Length
   Problem", "Unsupported CC Interval".

5.  Security Considerations

   The signalling of OAM related parameters and the automatic
   establishment of OAM entities introduces additional security
   considerations to those discussed in [RFC3473].  In particular, a
   network element could be overloaded, if an attacker would request
   liveliness monitoring, with frequent periodic messages, for a high
   number of LSPs, targeting a single network element.

   Security aspects will be covered in more detailed in subsequent
   versions of this document.
