Internet-Draft      RTCP XR Decodability Report Blocks       August 2011


1.  Introduction

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] for use in Transport Stream.  The new block type supports
   the reporting of consistency of Transport Stream [ETSI]by checking TS
   header information.  This new block type can be useful for
   identifying the existence, and characterizing the severity, of a
   packet transport problem which may affect users' perception of a
   service delivered over RTP, also useful for verifying the continued
   correct operation of an existing system management and providing
   accurate measures of Transport Stream quality for operators.

   The new report block is in compliance with the mornitoring
   architecture specified in [I-D.ietf-pmol-metrics-framework](work in
   progress).The metric is applicable to any other types of RTP
   application that use TS standard format for transmission and storage
   of audio, video, and data.


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

2.2.  Acronyms

   SSRC
      Synchronization Source [RFC3550]

   TS
      Transport Stream [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2007]


3.  TR 101 290 Decodability Statistics Metric Report Block

   This block reports decodability statistics metric beyond the
   information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.  Information
   is recorded about basic monitoring parameters necessary to ensure
   that the TS can be decoded including the number of Transport Stream
   Synchronization Losses, Sync byte errors, Continuity count errors,
   and continuous monitoring parameters including Transport errors,
   Program Clock Reference (PCR) errors, PCR repetition errors, PCR
   discontinuity indicator errors, and Presentation Time Stamp (PTS)

   errors [ETSI].  Such information can be useful for network management
   and real time application quality monitoring.

   Note that this metric report block is not only applicable to MPEG-2
   transport streams[RFC2250],but also applicable to any other Transport
   Streams that adopt other audio and video codec.

   The Decodability Metrics Block has the following format:

      A TR 101 290 decodability metrics report block is identified by
      the constant <TDM>.

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

4.  SDP Signaling

   One new parameter is defined for the one report blocks defined in
   this document to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566] using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].
   They have the following syntax within the "rtcp-xr" attribute
   [RFC3611]:

   rtcp-xr-attrib =  "a=rtcp-xr:"
                     [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

      xr-format = decodability-metrics

         decodability-metrics = "decodability-metrics"

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.


5.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of [RFC3611].

   This document assigns one new block type values in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry:

      Name:       TDM
      Long Name:  TR 101 290 Decodability Metrics
      Value       <TDM>
      Reference:  section 3

   This document also registers one SDP [RFC4566] parameters for the
   "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry:
