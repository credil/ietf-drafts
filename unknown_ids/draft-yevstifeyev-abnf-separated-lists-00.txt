INTERNET DRAFT     ABNF Notation for Separated Lists    December 5, 2010


1.  Introduction

   ABNF provides a possibility to express lists of elements, separated
   by commas (",") via the construction <a>#<b>element. However
   sometimes it is needed to express list of elements, separated by
   other characters, such as semicolons, points etc. In this case the
   following ABNF construction is used:

   ([*LWS] element [n*([*LWS] separator [*LWS] element)])

   It is obvious that this construction is too bulky. This document
   specifies universal ABNF notation for lists, separated by arbitrary
   characters.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses ABNF and core ABNF rules defined in RFC 5234
   [RFC5234].

INTERNET DRAFT     ABNF Notation for Separated Lists    December 5, 2010


2.  Notation Description

   The ABNF notation for separated lists is <n>^(<a>)<m>element
   indicating at least <n> and at most <m> elements separated by <a>.

   The ABNF for this construction is:

   n^(a)m element = ( n([*LWS] element) [*o([*LWS] a [*LWS] element)])
   n              = 1*DIGIT    ;minimum amount of elements
   m              = 1*DIGIT    ;maximum amount of elements
   o              = <m-n>      ;difference between <m> and <n>
   a              = VCHAR      ;separator

   <n> can be omitted indicating that any amount of elements not more
   than <m> is allowed (including zero).

   <m> can be omitted indicating that any amount of elements not less
   than <n> is allowed (including <n>).

   <n> and <m> can be omitted indicating that any amount of elements is
   allowed (including zero).
