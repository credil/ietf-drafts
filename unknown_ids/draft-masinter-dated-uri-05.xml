    <abstract>
      <t> This document defines two namespaces of URNs, based on using
  a timestamp with an (encoded) URI. The results are namespaces in
  which names are readily assigned, offer the persistence of reference
  that is required by URNs, but do not require a stable authority to
  assign the name. The first namespace ("duri") is used to refer to
  URI-identified resources as they appeared at a particular time.  The
  second namespace ("tdb") is useful as a way of creating URNs that
  refer to physical objects or even abstractions that are not
  themselves networked resources.
  </t>
      <t> The definition of these namespaces may reduce the need to
  define new URN namespaces merely for the purpose of creating stable
  identifiers. In addition, they provide a ready means for identifying
  "non-information resources" by semantic indirection.

<t>  The URN namespaces defined here solve several related problems.
</t>
<section title="Easy URN assignment">
<t>

  The URN specification <xref target="rfc1737" /> allows for many
  URN namespaces, and many have been registered. However, obtaining an
  appropriate URN in any of the currently defined URN namespaces may
  be difficult: a number of URN namespace registrations have been
  accompanied by comments that no other URN namespace was available
  for the class of documents for which identifiers were wanted.

</t>
</section>
<section title="Persistent identifiers">

<t>  <xref target="rfc1737">RFC 1737</xref>
 defines several requirements for Uniform Resource
  Names. In particular, it requires "persistence":
  <list style="empty">
   <t>
     Persistence: It is intended that the lifetime of a URN be
     permanent.  That is, the URN will be globally unique forever, and
     may well be used as a reference to a resource well beyond the
     lifetime of the resource it identifies or of any naming authority
     involved in the assignment of its name.
  </t>
  </list>
 </t>
  <t>  Many people have wondered how to create globally unique and
  persistent identifiers. There are a number of URI schemes and URN
  namespaces already registered. However, an absolute guarantee of
  both uniqueness and persistence is very difficult.
  </t><t>
  In some cases, the guarantee of persistence comes through a promise
  of good management practice, such as is encouraged in <xref 
  target="cool">"Cool URLs
  don't change"</xref>.  However, relying on promise of good
  management practice is not the same as having a design that
  guarantees reliability independent of actual administrative
  practice.
  </t><t>
  A primary design goal for URIs is that they are intended to mean the
  same thing, no matter in what context they appear: a "Uniform" way
  to Identify a Resource. However, even when URIs have Uniform meaning
  from the point of view of the source of the reference, they don't
  guarantee stability over time. Despite best efforts and intentions,
  identifying information can change in unpredictable ways: domain
  names can disappear or be reassigned, name assigning organizations
  can change structure, responsibility, disappear, merge, or change in
  unpredictable ways.
  </t><t>
  There is a significant dependence in the interpretation of many URNs
  with the concept of "naming authority". The authority is presumably
  some individual or organization both to insure uniqueness of
  assignment and also to help with understanding the meaning of the
  link between the name and the named.
  </t><t>
  However, authorities, whether individuals or organizations, have a
  lifetime, and must be consulted at some point to understand the
  bindings. The functioning of names as unique identifiers and holders
  of meaning depends on having a reliable infrastructure of consulting
  the authority or the authorities records to determine the thing
  referenced.
  </t>
</section>
<section title="URIs for abstractions">
<t>

  The description of URIs <xref target="rfc3986" /> describes a
  range for 'Resource' that is quite broad:
<list style="empty">
 <t>
     This specification does not limit the scope of what might be a
      resource; rather, the term "resource" is used in a general sense
      for whatever might be identified by a URI.  Familiar examples
      include an electronic document, an image, a source of information
      with a consistent purpose (e.g., "today's weather report for Los
      Angeles"), a service (e.g., an HTTP-to-SMS gateway), and a
      collection of other resources.
   A resource is not necessarily
      accessible via the Internet; e.g., human beings, corporations, and
      bound books in a library can also be resources.  Likewise,
      abstract concepts can be resources, such as the operators and
      operands of a mathematical equation, the types of a relationship
      (e.g., "parent" or "employee"), or numeric values (e.g., zero,
      one, and infinity).

 </t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
  One might use a URI such as "mailto:" email address to identify
  a person, or a "http:" URI to identify an abstract comment.
  However, this leaves the question of how one might identify, within
  the same context, both the system mailbox and the person to which
  it is assigned, or the web page at a http URI and the person or
  concept it describes. The "tdb" URN scheme allows ready assignment
  of URIs for abstractions that are distinguished from the media
  content that describes them.
</t><t>
  The goal, then, of the "tdb" URN scheme proposed below is to
  provide a mechanism which is, at the same time:
<list style="hanging">
<t> permanent: The identity of the resource identified
      is not subject to reinterpretation over time.
</t>
<t>explicitly bound: The mechanism by which the identified
      resource can be determined is explicitly included in
      the URI.
</t>
<t>useful for non-networked items:
 Allows identification of resources outside the network:
      people, organizations, abstract concepts.
</t>
<t>no administration:
 The mechanism does not depend on reliable administrative processes
      of authorities for either assignment or interpretation.
</t>
</list>
</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="defs" title="Namespace definitions">

<section anchor="durin" title='"duri" namespace'>

<t>
  It is traditional in convention references and citations in printed
  works to include the date of publication; this practice serves the
  important purpose that the context of the naming can be determined.
</t><t>
  The "duri" URN namespace takes the form:
</t>
<figure>
<artwork>     urn:duri:&lt;date&gt;:&lt;encoded-URI&gt;
</artwork>
</figure>
  <t>where &lt;date&gt; is a digit string corresponding to a date (<xref target="dates" />),
  and an &lt;encoded-URI&gt; is an absolute URI-reference <xref target="rfc3986" />  in
  which any character excluded from URN syntax has been escaped
  (<xref target="encoding" />).
</t><t>
  The meaning of a duri is "the resource (or fragment) that was
  identified by the &lt;encoded-URI&gt; (after hex decoding) at the very
  last instant of the date(time) given".
</t><t>
  
  For example, 'urn:duri:2001:http://www.ietf.org' is a persistent
  identifier to 'http://www.ietf.org' as of the very last instant of
  the year 2001. A duri may not be a resource locator in a practical
  sense if the time of location has not yet arrived or has
  passed. However, is an acceptable resource identifier, and fulfills
  all of the requirements for URNs <xref target="rfc1737" />.
  
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="tdb" title='"tdb" namespace'>
<t>
  
  The second URN namespace defined is a parallel space which is useful
  for describing entities, concepts, abstractions, and other items
  which are not themselves network accessible resources, but have been
  at some point described by network accessible resources.
  
</t><t>
  The "tdb" namespace designates the "thing described by" a resource at
  a given URI at the given time. This URN namespace is described by
  'tdb', e.g.,
<figure><artwork>
        urn:tdb:&lt;date&gt;:&lt;encoded-URI&gt;
</artwork></figure>
  with the same syntactic rules as 'duri'.
</t><t>
  The intent is to use the inversion of "is a document about".  It is
  common practice to give a reference for a concept by including a
  pointer to a document, segment, phrase that defines the concept.
  "tdb" attempts to capture this practice in URI space.
</t><t>
  For example, "urn:tdb:2001:http://www.ietf.org" can be used to
  designate the Internet Engineering Task Force organization, at least
  as it was described by or referenced by its home page at the last
  instant of 2001.
</t><t>
  The "tdb" namespace differs from most other URN methods for
  identifying abstractions because the designation of what is actually
  identified by the tdb doesn't depend on knowing the intention of the
  "assigner" of the identifier. Unlike many of the alternatives
  proposed, the identification is not dependent on the context of use.
</t><t>
  The "tdb" namespace can be thought of as adding a level of
  semantic indirection to URI resolution. While one could imagine using 'tdb'
  without a date, it would leave the possibility that a reference that
  is unambiguous at one time might become ambiguous at some other
  time. There are two ways that the date is useful for "tdb" URNs:
  it fixes the time of access of the resource, for variable descriptions,
  and it fixes the time of interpretation, for descriptions whose
  meaning (in natural language) might vary.
  
</t>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="encoding" title="Encoding URIs">
<t>
  Both "duri" and "tdb" URN namespaces require that some characters in
  the URI references be encoded.
</t>

<section title="Characters that must be encoded">

<t>
  The characters that must be encoded are:
<list style="symbols">
  <t> All characters marked excluded in 
   <xref target="rfc2141">RFC 2141</xref>, section 2.4: <vspace />
                &quot;&amp;&lt;&gt;[]^`{|}~  <vspace />
    These are excluded because they are not allowed in URNs.
  </t>
   <t> The character "#" <vspace />
     Note that &lt;encoded-URI&gt; can include a
    fragment identifier; the "#" character used to delimit it must
    be encoded. This feature is intended for use with "tdb", where
    the fragment identified might contain the description. Including
    an encoded "#" with a "duri" is not as useful, since the fragment
    identifier might as well be applied to the duri itself.
  </t>
  <t> The character "%" <vspace />
    The encoded-URI can itself contain encoded characters, which are
    encoded with the same method. To insure that decoding happens at
   the right level of processing, the "%" itself must be encoded.
    Unfortunately, there may well be cases where there is a double
    encoding of characters, first to construct the embedded URI
    itself and second to then embed the URI within the tdb or
    duri URN.
 </t>
 </list>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Hierarchy and unencoded /">
<t>
  The URN specification <xref target="rfc1737" /> 
  discourages the use of "/" in URNs because,
  in general, there is no good interpretation of hierarchy and
  relative URIs for assigned names. However, for the particular case
  of duris (at least), there seems to be no good reason to avoid the
  "/" because it corresponds fairly naturally (in many cases) to the
  hierarchy of the original space.
</t><t>
  Note that because of this, "duri" URNs can actually be used with
  relative URI references with some amount of reliability. (The double
  encoding of previously encoded URI characters causes some problems.)
</t>  
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="dates" title="Dates">
<t>
  A &lt;date&gt; is a simple expression of date, optional time, with
  arbitrary precision. The goal is to allow relatively short
  expressions of dates with no ambiguity, and with arbitrary
  precision. 
</t>
<figure>
<artwork>
  date = year [ month [ day [ hour [ minute [ second [ fraction ]]]]]]

   year     = 4digit
   month    = 2digit
   day      = 2digit
   hour     = 2digit
   minute   = 2digit
   second   = 2digit
   fraction = *digit
</artwork>
</figure>
<t>
  The representation of a date or time refers to the very last instant
  of the given date/time range at the resolution supplied, so that
  1999 and 1999123123595999999 are equivalent. If necessary, "dates" can
  include times and even fractional times, so that a generator of
  duris can be arbitrarily precise.
</t><t>
  Dates are interpreted relative to International Atomic Time (TAI)
  <xref target="TAI" />.  The syntax and semantics are similar to
  those in <xref target="rfc2550">RFC 2550</xref>; in particular,
  using TAI avoids ambiguity about time zones and difficulties with
  leap seconds. 

</t>
</section>
<section anchor="additional" title="Additional Considerations">
<t></t>
<section title="Embedded URI schemes">
<t>
  The intent of "duri" and "tdb" is to use them with embedded URI
  references that identify documents or document fragments. That is,
  they are most useful for information resources.
</t><t>
  
  
  For example, use with a "http" URI can be used to refer to a web
  page or the subject of a web site at a given time. This can be a way
  of referring to a web site at some time in the past, or an
  organization that has changed or merged.
  
</t><t>
  Local systems that have known-to-be unique host names can use "file" URIs
  with "tdb", for example, </t>
<figure><artwork>
    urn:tdb:20010814142327:file://this.example.com/c|/temp/test.txt
</artwork></figure>
  
  <t> since this use is primarily focused on providing a unique way of
  identifying an abstraction, even if the referent of the abstraction
  is not widely known. (Using 'file:' URIs in this way without a fully
  qualified domain name is not recommended, because the interpretation
  is not uniform.)
  
</t><t> Some URI schemes are more problematic. For example, using tdb
  or duri with an embedded 'urn:' might not seem to be too useful.
  But it might be useful where the assignment of names in a URN
  namespace are not, in practice, permanent, or that one might want to
  refer to the assignment as of a given date. In this case, it is
  possible to use a "urn" within a "duri", e.g., </t>
  
<figure><artwork>
      urn:duri:2000:urn:ietf:std:50
</artwork></figure>
 <t>  might be used to refer to "the document that was STD 50 in effect as
  of the last instant of 2000". <xref target="rfc2648" />

</t><t>
  One might consider using "tdb" with "data" to designate concepts
  that can be described uniquely briefly inline. For example, </t>
<figure><artwork>
     urn:tdb:2001:data:,The%2520US%2520president
</artwork></figure>
  
  <t> names the concept described by the (text/plain) string "The US
  president" at the very last instant of 2001. (Note the awkward
  double quoting of space as "%20" and then the "%" as "%25".) Of
  course, this practice is only useful if the referent of the data is
  (or was at the time) completely unique. Since "data" does not
  contain a way to designate content-language, the string in question
  would have to not be ambiguous as to its language.  In the case of
  'data', there is no assigning authority at all; the interpretation
  of the 'tdb' URN depend on the interpreting community.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Why dates for both tdb and duri?">
<t>
  
Some have suggested that perhaps only one of "tdb" or "duri" might
have a date parameter, e.g., allow "tdb:&lt;encoded-URI&gt;" as a URI
scheme, and "urn:duri:&lt;date&gt;:tdb:&lt;encoded-URI&gt;" if one
really wanted to fix the date of interpretation. While doing this
might be possible, it seems that the usage pattern which allows the
date to be omitted when needed satisfies the instances where the
resource doing the description is permanent to stand.

</t><t>

There are actually two dates to consider, with "tdb". There is
the date that the resource is obtained, and there is the date
that the description it makes is read, understood, and used to denote.
Normally in a literary work in natural language which makes
a reference to another work, both the reference itself and the
work referenced are dated, e.g., a footnote in an article
written in 1967 might talk about a "private communication" which
itself had a date. The difference between a URI and a conventional
literary reference is the desire to be able to extract the URI
from its context and still retain its meaning.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Useful dates">

<t>

  
  Dates far in the future are suspect, because the meaning of the duri
  or tdb cannot readily be determined in advance reliably.  Dates
  whose range ends before assignment of the resource to the embedded
  URI SHOULD NOT be used, because the meaning of the reference is left
  in question. For example, using http URIs with a date range which
  ends before a web service was available at the given URI doesn't
  make much sense.

</t><t>
  However, although these practices are NOT RECOMMENDED, there is no
  assurance that they haven't been used; by itself, a duri/tdb does not
  constitute an assertion that the encoded-URI was available or
  assigned at the date specified.
</t><t>
  Note that the use of the "very last instant" allows for the 
  conventional bibliographic convention that a work published
  in 2009 can use "2009" as the date string, to refer to the
  work in the year of publication. 
</t>
</section>
<section title="Free assignment">
<t>
  
  Because of the many possible schemes that can be used in the
  &lt;encoded-  URI&gt; portion, there should be no difficulty in almost any
  computational process being able to assign duris or tdbs at will. Of
  course, it is necessary for there to be some resource which is
  available at some point in time, and to have a clock which is
  accurate to the granularity of the frequency of assignment.
  
</t>
</section>
<section anchor="resolution" title="Resolution">
<t>

  There no accurate resolution servers for duri or tdb URNs. However,
  duri might be "resolvable" in the sense that a resource that was
  accessed at a point in time might have the result of that access
  cached or archived in an Internet archive service. See, for example,
  the "Internet Archive" project <xref target="archive" />. A
  "tdb" is only tesolvable in the sense that if the corresponding duri
  can be esolved, it may be possible that the result can be accessed
  and interpreted.

</t><t>
  
  Clients without access to an Internet archive service might take the
  decoded &lt;encoded-URI&gt; of a duri and attempt resolution of
  *that* identifier. This will give an approximation whose reliability
  depends on the amount of time elapsed since the date indicated.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Why Names with Semantics?">
<t>
  
  There are a number of proposals for URN schemes that create otherwise
  unbound "names", where the URN scheme only provides for uniqueness.
  Neither "duri" nor "tdb" intrinsically have the property that the
  names assigned are without any resolution semantics. This is
  intentional; it's difficult to create names that carry no semantics
  whatsoever about the authority that assigned the name and the
  intention of the authority for what the name should designate.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Avoiding MetaData">
<t>
  One might consider the date in a duri/tdb to be just one piece of
  additional metadata about the encoded-URI, and consider adding other
  pieces of metadata as annotation.
</t><t>
  However, the use of the date in a duri/tdb is intended primarily as a
  mechanism of accomplishing uniqueness over time. No other bit of
  metadata or description readily fills that purpose. Further, the date
  is not descriptive (an assertion about the encoded-URI) but merely
  refining.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Avoiding duri and tdb">
<t>
  
  Many applications of URIs already provide a context of date. For
  example, one could imagine a hypertext system where the URIs contained
  within a document were intended to refer to the resources as of the
  date of the enclosing document. This would be a reasonable
  interpretation of URIs within an Internet archive system, for example.
  
</t><t>
  And some applications of URIs arguably already contain the level of
  interpretive indirection that is explicit with "tdb". For example,
  one might consider the use of URIs as namespace names within XML
  <xref target="namespaces" /> as a reference to the "thing
  described by" the URI used.
  
</t>
</section>

<section title="tdb and levels of indirection">
<t>
  
  The "tdb" scheme introduces a level of semantic indirection. The
  puzzles and confusions about use and mention, name and reference,
  and levels of indirection have been puzzling and amusing for quite a
  while.

</t><t hangText="Identifier persistence considerations:">
      The designation of a dated URI is completely persistent
      for all time, although the intent of a resource that
      is no longer available will be hard to discern.
</t><t hangText="Process of identifier assignment:">
      Any date can be used with any URI independently
      by anyone. However, assigning an identifier to
      a non-networked resource such as a person or
     abstract concept requires (at least conceptually)
     first creating a networked resource that uniquely
     describes the target, and then constructing the duri
     using the URI of the description.
</t><t hangText="Process of identifier resolution:">
      Resolution of "tdb" identifiers requires interpreting
      the resource identified by the corresponding "duri".

  This document includes two URN NID registrations (<xref
  target="durispec" /> and <xref target="tdbspec" />) that should be
  entered into the IANA registry of URN NIDs.

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>
  "duri" and "tdb" identifiers are not any more reliable because they 
  have dates.  URIs don't contain enough information to supply the
  authority for deciding what was or wasn't at a given URI at a given
  date.

<section anchor="acks" title="Acknowledgements">
<t>
  There have been many discussions over several years on the relationship of URLs, URNs, URIs, resources and resource identifiers, with many contributions.
   Particular thanks to Aaron Swartz, Brian McBride and
  Stuart Williams, Michael Mealling, and many others.
