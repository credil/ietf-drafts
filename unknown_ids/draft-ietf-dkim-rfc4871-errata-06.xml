      <t>This updates RFC 4871, DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures.
        Specifically the document clarifies the nature, roles and relationship
        of the two DKIM identifier tag values that are candidates for payload
        delivery to a receiving processing module. The Update is in the style
        of an Errata entry, albeit a rather long one.</t>

    <section
      title="Introduction">
      <t>About the purpose for DKIM, <xref
          target="RFC4871" /> states: <list>
          <t> The ultimate goal of this framework is to permit a signing
            domain to assert responsibility for a message, thus protecting
            message signer identity... </t>
        </list> Hence, DKIM has a signer that produces a signed message, a
        verifier that confirms the signature and an assessor that consumes the
        validated signing domain. So the simple purpose of DKIM is to
        communicate an identifier to a receive-side assessor module. The
        identifier is in the form of a domain name that refers to a
        responsible identity. For DKIM to be interoperable and useful, signer
        and assessor must share the same understanding of the details about
        the identifier.</t>

      <t>However the RFC4871 specification defines two, potentially different
        identifiers that are carried in the DKIM-Signature: header field, d=
        and i=. Either might be delivered to a receiving processing module
        that consumes validated payload. The DKIM specification fails to
        clearly define what is "payload" to be delivered to a consuming
        module, versus what is internal and merely in support of achieving
        payload delivery. </t>
      <t>This currently leaves signers and assessors with the potential for
        having differing -- and therefore non-interoperable -- interpretations
        of how DKIM operates.</t>

      <t>This update resolves this confusion. It defines new labels for the
        two values, clarifies their nature, and specifies their
        relationship. <list

    OPTIONAL, default is an empty Local-part followed by an "@"
    followed by the domain from the "d=" tag).  The syntax is a
    standard email address where the Local-part MAY be omitted.  The
    domain part of the address MUST be the same as or a subdomain of
    the value of the "d=" tag.

    Internationalized domain names MUST be converted using the steps
    listed in Section 4 of [RFC3490] using the "ToASCII" function.

       sig-i-tag =  %x69 [FWS] "=" [FWS] 
                    [ Local-part ] "@" domain-name
 
    INFORMATIVE NOTE: The Local-part of the "i=" tag is optional
    because in some cases a signer may not be able to establish a
    verified individual identity.  In such cases, the signer may
    wish to assert that although it is willing to go as far as
    signing for the domain, it is unable or unwilling to commit
    to an individual user name within their domain.  It can do so
    by including the domain part but not the Local-part of the
    identity.

    INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION: This document does not require the value
    of the "i=" tag to match the identity in any message header
    fields.  This is considered to be a verifier policy issue.
    Constraints between the value of the "i=" tag and other
    identities in other header fields seek to apply basic
    authentication into the semantics of trust associated with a
    role such as content author.  Trust is a broad and complex
    topic and trust mechanisms are subject to highly creative
    attacks.  The real-world efficacy of 
    bindings between the "i=" value and other identities is not
    well established, nor is its vulnerability to subversion by
    an attacker.  Hence reliance on the use of these options
    should be strictly limited.  In particular, it is not at all
    clear to what extent a typical end-user recipient can rely on
    any assurances that might be made by successful use of the
    "i=" options.]]></artwork>

                Notably, the domain name is not required to be registered in
                the DNS -- so it might not resolve in a query -- and the
                Local-part MAY be drawn from a namespace that does not contain
                the user's mailbox. The details of the structure and semantics
                for the namespace are determined by the Signer. Any knowledge
                or use of those details by verifiers or assessors is outside
                the scope of the DKIM Signing specification. The Signer MAY
                choose to use the same namespace for its AUIDs as its users'
                email addresses, or MAY choose other means of representing its
                users. However, the signer SHOULD use the same AUID for each message
                intended to be evaluated as being within the same sphere of
                responsibility, if it wishes to offer receivers the option of
                using the AUID as a stable identifier that is finer grained

            (AUID).</t>

          <t> Hence, DKIM's mandatory output to a receive-side Identity
            Assessor is a single domain name. Within the scope of its use as
            DKIM output, the name has only basic domain name semantics; any
            possible owner-specific semantics are outside the scope of DKIM.
            That is, within its role as a DKIM identifier, additional
            semantics cannot be assumed by an Identity Assessor.</t>
          <t> A receive-side DKIM verifier MUST communicate the Signing Domain
            Identifier (d=) to a consuming Identity Assessor module and MAY
            communicate the Agent or User Identifier (i=) if present. </t>
          <t> To the extent that a receiver attempts to intuit any structured
            semantics for either of the identifiers, this is a heuristic
            function that is outside the scope of DKIM's specification and
            semantics. Hence it is relegated to a higher-level service, such
            as a delivery handling filter that integrates a variety of inputs
            and performs heuristic analysis of them. </t>


          <t>INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION: This document does not require the value
            of the SDID or AUID to match the identifier in any other message header
            field.  This requirement is, instead, an assessor policy issue.
            The purpose of such a linkage would be to authenticate the value in that
            other header field.   This, in turn, is the basis for applying a trust
            assessment based on the identifier value. Trust is a broad and complex topic and
            trust mechanisms are subject to highly creative attacks. The
            real-world efficacy of any but the most basic bindings between the
            SDID or AUID and other identities is not well established, nor is
            its vulnerability to subversion by an attacker. Hence reliance on
            the use of such bindings should be strictly limited. In
            particular, it is not at all clear to what extent a typical
            end-user recipient can rely on any assurances that might be made
            by successful use of the SDID or AUID.</t>

        affects interoperability, semantic characterization, and the
        expectations for the identifiers carried with a DKIM signature.
        Clarification of these details is likely to limit misinterpretation of

            <t>Until now, there has been no standard method for domain names to use characters outside the ASCII repertoire.  This document defines internationalized domain names (IDNs) and a mechanism called Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) for handling them in a standard fashion.  IDNs use characters drawn from a large repertoire (Unicode), but IDNA allows the non-ASCII characters to be represented using only the ASCII characters already allowed in so-called host names today.  This backward-compatible representation is required in existing protocols like DNS, so that IDNs can be introduced with no changes to the existing infrastructure.  IDNA is only meant for processing domain names, not free text. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>
