   Optical End Node: The end of a wavelength (optical lambdas) lightpath 
   in the data plane.  It may be equipped with some optical/electronic 
   devices such as wavelength multiplexers/demultiplexer (e.g. AWG), 
   optical transponder, etc., which are employed to transmit/terminate 
   the optical signals for data transmission. 

    

3. Requirements for WSON Signaling 

   The following requirements for GMPLS based WSON signaling are in 
   addition to the functionality already provided by existing GMPLS 
   signaling mechanisms.  

3.1. WSON Signal Characterization 

   WSON signaling MUST convey sufficient information characterizing the 
   signal to allow systems along the path to determine compatibility and 
   perform any required local configuration. Examples of such systems 
   include intermediate nodes (ROADMs, OXCs, Wavelength converters, 
   Regenerators, OEO Switches, etc...), links (WDM systems) and end 
   systems (detectors, demodulators, etc...). The details of any local 
   configuration are out of the scope of this document. 

3.2. Bi-Directional Distributed Wavelength Assignment 

   WSON signaling MAY support distributed wavelength assignment 
   consistent with the wavelength continuity constraint for bi-
   directional connections. The following two cases MAY be separately 
   supported: (a) Where the same wavelength is used for both upstream 
   and downstream directions, and (b) Where different wavelengths can be 
   used for both upstream and downstream directions.  

   The need for the same wavelength on both directions mainly comes from 
   the color constraint on some edges' hardware. In fact, the edges can 
   be classified into two types, i.e. without and with the wavelength-
   port mapping re-configurability.  

   Without the mapping re-configurability at edges, the edge nodes must 
   use the same wavelength in both directions.  For example, (1) 
   transponders are only connected to AWGs (i.e. multiplexer/de-
   multiplexer) ports directly and fixedly, or (2) transponders are 
   connected to the add/drop ports of ROADM and each port is mapped to a 
   dedicated wavelength fixedly.  

   On the other hand, with the mapping re-configurability at edges, the 
   edge nodes can use different wavelengths in different directions. For 
 
 
Bernstein et al.       Expires January 8, 2010                 [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions               July 2009 
    

   example, in edge nodes, transponders are connected to add/drop ports 
   of colorless ROADM. Thus, the wavelength-port remapping problem can 
   be solved locally by appropriately configuring the colorless ROADM. 
   If the colorless ROADM consists of OXC and AWGs, the OXC is 
   configured appropriately.  

   The edges of data-plane in WSON can be constructed in different types 
   based on cost and flexibility concerns.  Without re-configurability 
   we should consider the constraint of the same wavelength usage on 
   both directions, but have lower costs. While, with wavelength-port 
   mapping re-configurability we can relax the constraint, but have 
   higher costs.  

   These two types of edges will co-exist in WSON mesh, till all the 
   edges are unified by the same type. The existence of the first type 
   edges presents a requirement of the same wavelength usage on both 
   directions, which must be supported.   

   Moreover, if some carriers prefer an easy management lightpath usage, 
   say use the same wavelength on both directions to reduce the burden 
   on lightpath management, the same wavelength usage would be 
   beneficial. 

   In cases of equipment failure, etc., fast provisioning used in quick 
   recovery is critical to protect Carriers/Users against system loss. 
   This requires efficient signaling which supports distributed 
   wavelength assignment, in particular when the centralized wavelength 
   assignment capability is not available. 

3.3. Distributed Wavelength Assignment Support 

   WSON signaling MAY support the selection of a specific distributed 
   wavelength assignment method. 

   As discussed in the [WSON-Frame] a variety of different wavelength 
   assignment algorithms have been developed. A number of these are 
   suitable for use in distributed wavelength assignment. This feature 
   would allow the specification of a particular approach when more than 
   one are implemented in the systems along the path. 

3.4. Out of Scope 

   This draft does not address signaling information related to optical 
   impairments.

4. WSON Signal Types, Forward Error Correction, and Rates 

   As discussed in [WSON-Comp] single channel optical signals used in 
   WSONs are called "optical tributary signals" and come in a number of 
   classes characterized by modulation format and bit rate. Although 
   WSONs are fairly transparent to the signals they carry, to ensure 
   compatibility amongst various networks devices and end systems it can 
   be important to include key lightpath characteristics as traffic 
   parameters in signaling [WSON-Comp].  

4.1. Traffic Parameters for Optical Tributary Signals 

   As in [RFC4606] and [RFC4328] the following traffic parameters would 
   become the contents for the RSVP SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects. 
   The WSON traffic parameters SHOULD be defined as follows: 

   0                   1                   2                   3

       2        RZ 
 

   Modulation Parameters(Mod Params): Are specific to the modulation 
   type. 

    
   For RZ modulation type we have the following modulation parameters 
   and meanings. 

   RZ 0 - 33%, 1 -  50%, 2 - 67% duty cycles

   See [G.959.1] and [Winzer06]. 

   These are specific to the modulation type employed and may or may not 
   be used.  For example NRZ modulation typically doesn't have extra 
   parameters, while RZ modulation has a duty cycle parameter. 

   Bitrate: 

   This is the bit rate given as a 32 bit IEEE floating point number. 

5. Bidirectional Lightpath using Same Wavelength 

   With the wavelength continuity constraint in CI-incapable [RFC3471] 
   WSONs, where the nodes in the networks cannot support wavelength 
   conversion, the same wavelength on each link along a unidirectional 
   lightpath should be reserved.  Per the definition in [RFC3471], a 
   bidirectional lightpath can be seen as a pair of unidirectional 
   lightpaths, which are provisioned along the same route simultaneously 
   by the RSVP-TE signaling with Upstream Label and Label Set Objects in 
   the messages [RFC3473]. This does not necessarily require the same 
   wavelength in both directions. 

   In addition to the wavelength continuity constraint, requirement 3.2 
   gives us another constraint on wavelength usage in data plane, in 
   particular, it requires the same wavelength to be used in both 
   directions. 

   The simplest and efficient way is to only define an extension to the 
   processing of Label Set [RFC3473], and leave the other processes 
   untouched.  The issues related to this new functionality including an 
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES object defined in [RFC5420] and the new procedure are 
   described in the following sections. This approach would have a lower 
   blocking probability and a shorter provisioning time.  In cases of 
   equipment failure, etc., fast provisioning used in quick recovery is 
   critical to protect Carriers/Users against system loss. 

5.1. Using LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object 

   To trigger the new functionality at each GMPLS node, it is necessary 
   to notify the receiver the new type lightpath request.  One multi-
   purpose flag/attribute parameter container object called 
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and related mechanism defined in [RFC5420] meet 
   this requirement. One bit in Attributes Flags TLV which indicates the 
   new type lightpath, say, the bidirectional same wavelength lightpath 
   will be present in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object.  Please refer to 
   [RFC5420] for detailed descriptions of the Flag and related issues.

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions               July 2009 
    

5.2. Bidirectional Lightpath Signaling Procedure  

   Considering the system configuration mentioned above, it is needed to 
   add a new function into RSVP-TE to support bidirectional lightpath 
   with same wavelength on both directions. 

   The lightpath setup procedure is described below: 

   1. Ingress node adds the new type lightpath indication in an 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object.  It is propagated in the Path message in 
      the same way as that of a Label Set object for downstream; 

   2. On reception of a Path message containing both the new type 
      lightpath indication in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and Label Set 
      object, the receiver of message along the path checks the local 
      LSP database to see if the Label Set TLVs are acceptable on both 
      directions jointly.  If there are acceptable wavelengths, then 
      copy the values of them into new Label Set TLVs, and forward the 
      Path message to the downstream node.  Otherwise the Path message 
      will be terminated, and a PathErr message with a "Routing 
      problem/Label Set" indication will be generated; 

   3. On reception of a Path message containing both such a new type 
      lightpath indication in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and an Upstream 
      Label object, the receiver MUST terminate the Path message using 
      a PathErr message with Error Code "Unknown Attributes TLV" and 
      Error Value set to the value of the new type lightpath TLV type 
      code; 

   4. On reception of a Path message containing both the new type 
      lightpath indication in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and Label Set 
      object, the egress node verifies whether the Label Set TLVs are 
      acceptable, if one or more wavelengths are available on both 
      directions, then any one available wavelength could be selected.  
      A Resv message is generated and propagated to upstream node; 

   5. When a Resv message is received at an intermediate node, if it is 
      a new type lightpath, the intermediate node allocates the label 
      to interfaces on both directions and update internal database for 
      this bidirectional same wavelength lightpath, then configures the 
      local ROADM or OXC on both directions. 

   Except the procedure related to Label Set object, the other processes 
   will be left untouched.

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions               July 2009 
    

5.3. Backward Compatibility Considerations 

   Due to the introduction of new processing on Label Set object, it is 
   required that each node in the lightpath is able to recognize the new 
   type lightpath indication Flag carried by an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object, 
   and deal with the new Label Set operation correctly.  It is noted 
   that this new extension is not backward compatible. 

   According to the descriptions in [RFC5420], an LSR that does not 
   recognize a TLV type code carried in this object MUST reject the Path 
   message using a PathErr message with Error Code "Unknown Attributes 
   TLV" and Error Value set to the value of the Attributes Flags TLV 
   type code. 

   An LSR that does not recognize a bit set in the Attributes Flags TLV 
   MUST reject the Path message using a PathErr message with Error Code 
   "Unknown Attributes Bit" and Error Value set to the bit number of the 
   new type lightpath Flag in the Attributes Flags.The reader is 
   referred to the detailed backward compatibility considerations 
   expressed in [RFC5420]. 

    

6. Bidirectional Lightpath using Different Wavelengths 

   TBD 

7. RWA Related 

7.1. Wavelength Assignment Method Selection 

   As discussed in [HZang00] a number of different wavelength assignment 
   algorithms maybe employed. In addition as discussed in [WSON-Frame] 
   the wavelength assignment can be either for a unidirectional 
   lightpath or for a bidirectional lightpath constrained to use the 
   same lambda in both directions. A simple TLV could be used to 
   indication wavelength assignment directionality and wavelength 
   assignment method. This would be placed in an LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES 
   object per [RFC5420]. The use of a TLV in the LSP required attributes 
   object was pointed out in [Xu].

   earlier material]

8. Security Considerations 

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models 
   within GMPLS and associated protocols. That is the OSPF-TE, RSVP-TE, 
   and PCEP security models could be operated unchanged.  
    
   However satisfying the requirements for RWA using the existing 
   protocols may significantly affect the loading of those protocols. 
   This makes the operation of the network more vulnerable to denial of 
   service attacks. Therefore additional care maybe required to ensure 
   that the protocols are secure in the WSON environment.  
    
   Furthermore the additional information distributed in order to 
   address the RWA problem represents a disclosure of network 
   capabilities that an operator may wish to keep private. Consideration 
   should be given to securing this information.  

    

9. IANA Considerations 

   TBD. Once finalized in our approach we will need identifiers for such 
   things and modulation types, modulation parameters, wavelength 
   assignment methods, etc...
