	<t>Electronic mail (historically known as "netmail" before "email"
	  came into common use) has been in active use in the Internet
	  community since the early 1970s.
	  Although many small adjustments
	  and clarifications have been made, the basic transport protocol
	  that is now used has been changed in only two important ways since
	  the publication of RFC 821 in August 1982.
	  One of those changes
	  was the introduction of DNS-based mail routing with the MX record
	  with RFC 974 in January 1986 (with some small clarifications in
	  RFC 1123 in October 1979).
	  The second was the introduction of a model for negotiating optional
	  services with RFC 1425 in February 1993.
	</t>
	<t>
	  While many mail systems over the years have relied more on the
	  robustness of receiving systems in the face of deviations (or
	  creative interpretations of RFC 821 language in spite of changes
	  and clarifications over the last 27 years), the DRUMS WG work that
	  produced <xref target="RFC2821">RFC 2821</xref> in April 2001 was
	  largely an update to clarify various provisions.
	  With the exception of a very few edge-case clarifications and changes in
	  requirements levels, systems that conform to the combination of
	  <xref target="RFC0821">RFC 821</xref> and
	  <xref target="RFC1869">RFC 1869</xref> (both Full Standards)
	  conform to RFC 5321.
	  Those differences represented existing practice when RFC 5321 was
	  written and have been well-tested and widely deployed.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Proposed Changes">
        <t>The YAM WG proposes making the following changes in a revision:
	</t>
        <t>
	  <list style="hanging">
	    <t hangText="Terminology:">
	      There has been ongoing controversy about the
	      terminology in RFC 5321 and especially changes made between 821
	      and 2821 or between 2821 and 5321.
	      While we assume that 5321 is adequate, the WG will review
	      terminology as appropriate and may make some adjustments.</t>
	    <t hangText="Metalanguage:">
	      During and after IETF Last Call on 5321, some suggestions were made
	      about how to make metalanguage productions easier to find and
	      connect.
	      A complete rewrite or restructuring of the metalanguage
	      should be avoided on the grounds that it would carry a very high
	      risk of introducing errors.
	      Instead, resources and tools
	      permitting (significant manual work is now required), the revised
	      document will contain an index to productions and where they are
	      defined.</t>
	    <t hangText="Normative References:">
	      RFC 5321 is worded in a way that makes some references
	      normative that are not strictly required to be.
	      The WG will consider whether those rewordings are
		  appropriate.  In particular, the reference to RFC 821 will
		  be moved to Informative because all normative uses have been
		  removed.</t>
	   <t hangText="Existing Errata Reports:">
		  The working group will incorporate corrections to accepted errata,
		  as shown in the RFC Editor's errata tool.
		  Errata ID 1683 is currently the only such item.  IDs 1543 and 1851 are
		  reported, but unverified; the working group will consider those.
		  </t>
	   <t hangText="Small Editorial Errors:">
		  Clear up various small editorial errors, e.g., the use of
		  "SHOULD not" in one location.
		  YAM issue tracker issues 5, 6, 9, 12, and 13 refer to issues of this sort.
		  The working group will add others that may be identified in its detailed review.
		  </t>
	   <t hangText="Clarifications:">
		  The working group will attempt to address things that have ben identified as
		  unclear in RFC 5321.
		  YAM issue tracker issues 7, 8, 10, and 11 refer to issues of this sort.
		  There has been discussion of these on the mailing list, and the resolutions
		  of each may or may not result in a change in the document.  In no case will
		  clarification changes be significant enough to violate "Non-Changes",
		  <xref target="NoChange"/>.
		  </t>
		
	  </list>
	</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Non-Changes" anchor="NoChange">
	<t>The YAM WG discussed and chose not to make the following changes:
	</t>
        <t>
	  <list style="numbers">
        <t>Complete revision, rearrangement, or reformatting of
	      metalanguage (see #2 above).
	    </t>
	    <t>Any extensions that would violate the
	      rules for Full Standard or otherwise require revisiting the
	      approved interoperability report for RFC 5321.
	    </t>
	    <t>A number of extensions and changes that would have imposed
	      significant new requirements on SMTP, or that would have implied
	      incompatible changes, were proposed during both the DRUMS WG
	      period and during the discussions that led to RFC 5321.
	      In each case, the authors were advised to prepare a specific
	      Internet-Draft describing the change, convince the community to
	      progress it to Proposed Standard, and then implement and deploy
	      the change quickly enough to "catch up" with the progress that
	      started with RFC 2821.
	      The notion was that those changes could
	      then be integrated with the progression at the same maturity
	      level.
	      It is important to note that, independent of any
	      constraints imposed by the YAM charter design, none of those
	      proposals have appeared and been progressed even to IETF Last
	      Call.
	    </t>
		<t> As agreed when RFC 5321 was reviewed, the examples will
		   not be revised to bring them into alignment with RFC 2606
		   (BCP 32) conventions (example.com, etc.).  The issues are
		   explained in Section 1.3 of RFC 5321.  The community also
		   noted at the time that the relevant examples have been in
		   use, substantially unchanged, for more than a
		   quarter-century with no serious claims of confusion or
		   other harm being caused.</t>
		<t>The Security Considerations section was extensively
		   reviewed last year (during the review and approval of RFC
		   5321).  No evidence has appeared since then that would
		   require further review or additional changes.</t>
          </list>

      <section title="Downward references">
	<t>At Full Standard, the following references
          would be downward references:</t>
        <t><list style="hanging">
	    <t>RFC 5322 if 5322bis is not progressed simultaneously

	    </t>
	    <t>RFC 3848, ESMTP and LMTP Transmission Types
	      Registration.
	      Note that it is possible to rephrase
	      RFC 5321bis to avoid this normative reference and
	      the WG will consider doing that.

      <section title="IESG Feedback">

	  <list style="symbols">

        <t>
	      Excluding the previous proposed changes and expected IESG
	      support for technically substantive IETF last call feedback,
	      does the IESG believe any additional changes are critical to
	      advance this document from draft to full standard?
	      If so, please provide sufficient information so the WG can address
	      these issues prior to IETF last call or determine that the document
	      is inappropriate for the YAM WG to process at this time.
	    </t>
        <t>Does the IESG consider the downward references acceptable
	      for a full standard?
	      If not, please cite which specific
	      downward reference or references are problematic and why

	      or determine the document is inappropriate for the YAM WG
