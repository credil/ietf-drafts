            The SIP-based Media Recording Protocol (SIPREC)
                    draft-portman-siprec-protocol-00

Abstract

   SIPREC Session Recording Protocol is used for establishing recording
   session and reporting of the medata of the communication session.

   This document specifies the SIPREC Protocol (SIPREC).  SIPREC is used
   between Session Recording Client (SRC) and Session Recording Server
   (SRS).

Internet-Draft               SIPREC Protocol               December 2010


1.  Introduction

   Communication Session recording requires establishment of the
   recording session between communication system and recording system.
   In order to allow access to such recordings, information about the
   communication session (metadata) is also shared between SRC and SRS.

   The SIPREC Requirements [?] list a set of requirements that need to
   be met by session recording protocols.  The SIPREC protocol, which is
   specified in this document, meets these requirements.

   The SIPREC protocol is designed to support both UDP and TCP for SIP
   session establishment with special attention to reducing size of the
   required SIP messages.  In addition, it is designed for future
   extendability and protocol version management (backward
   compatability).

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Section 2
   defines the terminology used throughout this document, Section 3
   discusses the scope of SIPREC (i.e., which tasks fall within the
   scope of SIPREC and which ones are performed using different
   mechanisms), Section 4 provides a non-normative overview of SIPREC
   operation, and subsequent sections provide the normative
   specification of SIPREC.


2.  Definitions

   Session Recording Server (SRS): A Session Recording Server (SRS) is a
   SIP User Agent (UA) that is a specialized media server or collector
   that acts as the sink of the recorded media.  An SRS is a logical
   function that typically archives media for extended durations of time
   and provides interfaces for search and retrieval of the archived
   media.  An SRS is typically implemented as a multi-port device that
   is capable of receiving media from several sources simultaneously.
   An SRS is typically also the sink of the recorded session metadata.

   Session Recording Client (SRC): A Session Recording Client (SRC) is a
   SIP User Agent (UA) that acts as the source of the recorded media,
   sending it to the SRS.  An SRC is a logical function.  Its
   capabilities may be implemented across one or more physical devices.
   In practice, an SRC could be a personal device (such as a SIP phone),
   a SIP Media Gateway (MG), a Session Border Controller (SBC) or a SIP
   Media Server (MS) integrated with an Application Server (AS).  This
   specification defines the term SRC such that all such SIP entities
   can be generically addressed under one definition.  The SRC itself or
   another entity working on its behalf (such as a SIP Application
   Server) may act as the source of the recording metadata.

   Communication Session (CS): A session created between two or more SIP
   User Agents (UAs) that is the target for recording.

   Recording Session (RS): The SIP session created between an SRC and
   SRS for the purpose of recording a Communication Session.

   Figure 1 shows communication and recording sessions.

3.  Scope

   The scope of the SIPREC protocol is establishment of the recording
   sessions and reporting of the metadata.  The actual recording policy
   logic and access to the recorded sessions are out of scope of SIPREC.

   Figure 2 shows the tasks that SIPEC can perform.

5.  SIP Extensions

   The SRC should be able to accept re-Invite from SRS with the updated
   SDP as part of the session timer mechanism.

   The SRC and SRS should support inactive/receive only attributes in
   SDP and re- INVITE for media updates.

   When SRC sends INVITE to SRC, SRS might respond with a=inactive
   attribute as part of the SDP in the 200 OK response.  A re-INVITE
   will be sent in order to update the SRC with the updated SDP.

   As SRS only receives RTP streams from SRS, the 200 OK response will
   contain SDP with a=recvonly attribute.

   The From header must contain the SRC identity.  Participants
   information will be reported via metadata mechanism

Internet-Draft               SIPREC Protocol               December 2010


   Basic metadata information such as participants,call identifiers and
   direction should be passed in METADATA SIP header within INVITE
   request.

   Any other metadata should be passed as part of metadata event.  The
   meatadata reporting is using SIP Subscribe/Notify messages.

   SRC will send one or more streams to the SRC.  SRS will respond with
   the same number of media descriptors in the SDP body of the 200 OK.

   The SDP from the SRS will contain i attribute (information) to
   describe content of media lines.  For example, i=rx:1 tx:2 means that
   the first media descriptor is intended for the RX and the second
   media descriptor is intended for TX.  The following SDP example shows
   the use of i for specifying the directions:


           v=0
           o=SRS 0 0 IN IP4 172.22.3.8
           s=SRS
           i=rx:1 tx:2
           c=IN IP4 172.22.3.8
           t=0 0
           m=audio 12241 RTP/AVP 0 4 8
           a=sendrecv
           m=audio 12242 RTP/AVP 0 4 8
           a=sendrecv

                                 Figure 4

   Note: SRC RX stream is the stream (duplication) from the Customer to
   the Agent.  SRC TX stream is the stream (duplication) from the Agent
   to the Customer.

   [LEON] Open question: do we want to support both SDP in SRC offer and
   SRS answer?
