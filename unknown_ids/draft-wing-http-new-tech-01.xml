    <abstract>
      <t>People like their computers to work quickly. During the transition to
      new technology, both old and new technologies have to peacefully
      co-exist. However, if users experience connection delays attributed to
      the new technology the new technology will be shunned.</t>

      <t>HTTP ("The Web") is one of the most visible and time-critical
      applications that is used by nearly every Internet user. It is critical
      that new technologies which improve HTTP not impair or delay the display
      of HTTP content. It is also important that users retain the ability to
      share URIs amongst friends and colleagues, even if the other users have
      not upgraded to the new technology.</t>

      <t>This draft makes several recommendations to ensure user satisfaction
      and a smooth transition from HTTP's pervasive IPv4 to IPv6 and from TCP
      to SCTP.</t>

      <t>The audience for this draft is application developers and content
      providers. This draft is discussed on the Applications Discuss mailing
      list, https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/apps-discuss.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In order to use HTTP successfully over IPv6 or SCTP, it is necessary
      that the user enjoys nearly identical performance as compared to their
      old technology (IPv4 and TCP). A combination of today's applications,
      IPv6 tunneling and IPv6 service providers, IPv4 NAT, and some of today's
      content providers all cause the user experience to suffer (<xref
      target="problem_statement"></xref>). For IPv6, Google ensures a positive
      user experience by using a DNS white list of IPv6 service providers who
      peer directly with Google <xref target="whitelist"></xref>. However,
      this is not scalable to all service providers worldwide, nor is it
      scalable for other content providers to operate their own DNS white
      list.</t>

      <t>Instead, this document suggests a mechanism for applications to
      quickly determine if IPv6, IPv4, SCTP, or TCP is the most optimal to
      connect to a server. The suggestions in this document provide a user
      experience which is superior to HTTP using TCP and IPv4, especially in
      IPv6/IPv4 transition environment with dual stack hosts (e.g., <xref
      target="RFC4213"></xref>, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite">DS-Lite</xref>, <xref
      target="I-D.despres-6rd">6rd</xref>).</t>

<t>Once a certain address family is successful, it trends towards
preferring that address family.  Thus, repeated use of the application
DOES NOT cause repeated probes over both address families.</t>

      <t>The application recommendations in this document are primarily for
      HTTP clients ("web browsers") and may also be helpful for other
      applications.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="problem_statement" title="Problem Statement">
      <t>As discussed in more detail in <xref target="problem_uris"></xref>,
      it is important that the same URI and hostname be used for IPv4, IPv6,
      SCTP, and TCP. Using separate namespaces causes namespace fragmentation
      and reduces the ability for users to share URIs and hostnames, and
      complicates printed material that includes the URI or hostname.</t>

      <t>As discussed in more detail in <xref target="problem_ipv6"></xref>,
      IPv6 connectivity is sometimes broken entirely or, due to tunnel
      technologies might be slower than native IPv4 connectivity. However, due
      to port limitations inherent in stateful IPv6/IPv4 translators [BEHAVE],
      it is important that web browsers begin preferring IPv6 over IPv4 in
      order to avoid those port limitations.</t>

      <t>As discussed in more detail in <xref target="problem_sctp"></xref>,
      there is no standard mechanism to indicate a host supports a non-TCP
      transport protocol, such as SCTP.</t>

      <section anchor="problem_uris" title="URIs and hostnames">
        <t>URIs are often used between users to exchange pointers to content
        -- such as on Facebook, email, instant messaging, or other systems.
        Thus, production URIs and production hostnames containing references
        to IPv4, IPv6, TCP, or SCTP will only function if the other party also
        has application, OS, and a network that can access the URI or the
        hostname.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="problem_ipv6" title="IPv6">
        <t>When IPv6 connectivity is impaired, today's IPv6-capable web
        browsers incur many seconds of delay before falling back to IPv4. This
        harms the user's experience with IPv6, which will slow the acceptance
        of IPv6, because IPv6 is frequently disabled in its entirety on the
        end systems to improve the user experience.</t>

        <t>Reasons for such failure include no connection to the IPv6
        Internet, broken 6to4 or Teredo tunnel, and broken IPv6 peering. To
        prevent this delay an experiment with IPv6 connectivity, content
        providers use a separate namespace for their web server (e.g.,
        ipv6.example.com), but doing that with production systems causes the
        problems described in <xref target="problem_uris"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="problem_sctp" title="SCTP">
        <t>SCTP provides benefits over TCP <xref
        target="I-D.natarajan-http-over-sctp"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Unlike IPv6 which has an AAAA record, there is no DNS query that
        indicates a host supports <xref target="RFC4960">SCTP</xref>, and HTTP
        URI scheme is not extensible to support an SRV query that could
        provide such support. Even if there was, it isn't possible to
        determine if a middlebox, such as a firewall or a NAT, would block the
        SCTP association.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="HTTP Client Recommendations">
      <t>To provide fast connections for users, HTTP clients should make
      connections quickly over various technologies, automatically tune itself
      to avoid flooding the network with unnecessary connections (i.e., for
      technologies that have not made successful connections), and
      occasionally flush its self-tuning.</t>

      <t>If an HTTP client supports IPv6 and SCTP (in addition to IPv4 and
      TCP), the procedures described in <xref target="client_v6"></xref> and
      <xref target="client_sctp"></xref> are performed together.</t>

      <section anchor="client_v6" title="IPv6">
        <t>This section details how to provide robust dual stack service for
        both IPv6 and IPv4, so that the user perceives very fast application
        response.</t>

        <t>The HTTP client is configured with one value, P. A positive value
        indicates a preference for IPv6 and a negative value indicates a
        preference for IPv4. A value of 0 indicates equal weight, which means
        the A and AAAA queries and associated connection attempts will be sent
        as quickly as possible. The absolute value of P is the measure of a
        delay before initiating a connection attempt on the other address
        family. There are two P values maintained: one is application-wide and
        the other is specific per each destination (hostname and port).</t>

        <t>The algorithm attempts to delay the DNS query until it expects that
        address family will be necessary; that is, if the preference is
        towards IPv6, then AAAA will be queried immediately and the A query
        will be delayed.</t>

        <t>The HTTP client starts two threads in order to minimize the
        user-noticeable delay ("dead time") during the connection
        attempts:<list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="thread 1: (IPv6)"><list style="symbols">
                <t>If P&lt;0, wait for absolute value of p*10 milliseconds</t>

                <t>send DNS query for AAAA</t>

                <t>wait until DNS response is received</t>

                <t>Attempt to connect over IPv6 using TCP</t>
              </list></t>

            <t hangText="thread 2: (IPv4)"><list style="symbols">
                <t>if P&gt;0, wait for p*10 milliseconds</t>

                <t>send DNS query for A</t>

                <t>wait until DNS response is received</t>

                <t>Attempt to connect over IPv4 using TCP</t>
              </list></t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The first thread that succeeds returns the completed connection to
        the parent code and aborts the other thread (<xref
        target="abandon"></xref>).</t>

        <t>After a connection is successful, we want to adjust the
        application-wide preference and the per-destination preference. The
        value of P is incremented (decremented) each time an IPv6 (IPv4)
        connection is successfully made. When a connection using the
        less-preferred address family is successful, it indicates the wrong
        address family was used and the P is halved:<list style="symbols">
            <t>If P&gt;0 (indicating IPv6 is preferred over IPv4) and the
            first thread to finish was the IPv6 thread it indicates the IPv6
            preference is correct and we need to re-enforce this by increasing
            the application-wide P value by 1. However, if the first thread to
            finish was the IPv4 thread it indicates an IPv6 connection problem
            occurred and we need to aggressively prefer IPv4 more by halving P
            and rounding towards 0.</t>

            <t>If P&lt;0 (indicating IPv4 is preferred over IPv6) and the
            first thread to finish was the IPv4 thread it indicates the
            preference is correct and we need to re-enforce this gently by
            decreasing the application-wide P value by 1. However, if the
            first thread to finish was the IPv6 thread it indicates an IPv4
            connection problem and we need to aggressively avoid IPv4 by
            halving P and rounding towards 0.</t>

            <t>If P=0 (indicating equal preference), P is incremented if the
            first thread to complete was the IPv6 thread, or decremented if
            the first thread to complete was the IPv4 thread.</t>
          </list>After adjusting P, it should never be larger than 4 seconds
        -- which is similar to the value used by many IPv6-capable HTTP
        clients to switch to an alternate A or AAAA record.</t>

        <t><list style="empty">
            <t>Note: Proof of concept tests on fast networks show that even
            smaller value (around 0.5 seconds) is practical. More extensive
            testing would be useful to find the best upper boundary that still
            ensures a good user experience.</t>

      <section anchor="client_sctp" title="SCTP">
        <t>Due to the proliferation of NATs on the IPv4 Internet the best
        success for SCTP can be achieved by attempting both native SCTP
        connections and <xref
        target="I-D.tuexen-sctp-udp-encaps">SCTP-over-UDP</xref>
        connections.</t>

        <t>For SCTP the following parameters are used:<list hangIndent="8"
            style="hanging">
            <t hangText="SWAIT:">Application-wide wait time for an SCTP

            value of "BOTH" is RECOMMENDED.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The HTTP client starts several threads in order to minimize the
        user-noticeable delay ("dead time") during the connection attempts.
        The client starts one or more threads based on the following
        logic:</t>

        <t>If ((PREF == BOTH) or (PREF == SCTP)) start thread 1. If making a
        connection using IPv4 start thread 2.</t>

        <t>If ((PREF == BOTH) or (PREF == TCP)) start thread 3.</t>

        wait period, the HTTP client MAY choose TCP for the current HTTP

        show how good user experience can be maintained while the

        The good user experience is to the benefit of the user but to the

      </section>

      <section anchor="abandon" title="Abandon Non-Winning Connections">
        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that the non-winning connections be abandoned,
        even though they could be used to download content. This is because
        some web sites provide HTTP clients with cookies (after logging in)
        that incorporate the client's IP address, or use IP addresses to
        identify users. If some connections from the same HTTP client are
        arriving from different IP addresses, such HTTP applications will
        break. <list>
            <t>Editor's note: If we can provide guidance to IPv6 and SCTP
            developers that connections from the same client could arrive on
            IPv4, IPv6, TCP, and SCTP we could eliminate the above paragraph.
            But could we be sure all web sites would follow such guidance?</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Flush or Expire Cache">
        <t>Because every network has different characteristics (working or
        broken IPv6 connectivity, middlebox that permits or blocks SCTP, etc.)
        the IPv6/IPv4 preference value (P) and the SCTP parameters (SWAIT and
        PREF) SHOULD be reset to their default whenever the host is connected
        to a new network. However, in some instances the application and the
        host are unaware the network connectivity has changed (e.g., when
        behind a NAT) so it is RECOMMENDED that per-destination values expire
        after 10 minutes of inactivity.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Determining Address Type">
        <t>[[[ IS THIS SECTION NECESSARY ??</t>

        <t>For some transitional technologies such as a dual-stack host, it is
        easy for the application to recognize the native IPv6 address (learned
        via a AAAA query) and the native IPv4 address (learned via an A
        query). For other transitional technologies <xref
        target="RFC2766"></xref> it is impossible for the host to
        differentiate a transitional technology IPv6 address from a native
        IPv6 address (see Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC4966"></xref>).
        Replacement transitional technologies are attempting to bridge this
        gap. It is necessary for applications to distinguish between native
        and transitional addresses in order to provide the most seamless user
        experience.</t>
