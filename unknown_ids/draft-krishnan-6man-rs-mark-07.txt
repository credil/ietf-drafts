        Line identification in IPv6 Router Solicitation messages
                     draft-krishnan-6man-rs-mark-07

Abstract

   In Ethernet and GPON based aggregation networks, several subscriber
   premises may be logically connected to the same interface of an edge
   router.  This document proposes a method for the edge router to
   identify the subscriber premises using the contents of the received
   Router Solicitation messages.  The applicability is limited to the
   N:1 VLAN allocation model.

1.  Introduction

   DSL is a widely deployed access technology for Broadband Access for
   Next Generation Networks.  While traditionally DSL access networks
   were PPP based some networks are migrating from the traditional PPP
   access model into a pure IP-based Ethernet aggregated access
   environment.  Architectural and topological models of an Ethernet
   aggregation network in context of DSL aggregation are described in
   [TR101].

1.1.  Terminology

   1:1 VLAN                  It is a broadband network deployment
                             scenario where each user port is mapped to
                             a different VLAN on the Edge Router.  The
                             uniqueness of the mapping is maintained in
                             the Access Node and across the Aggregation
                             Network.
   N:1 VLAN                  It is a broadband network deployment
                             scenario where multiple user ports are
                             mapped to the same VLAN on the Edge Router.
                             The user ports may be located in the same
                             or different Access Nodes.
   AN                        A DSL or GPON Access Node.  The Access Node
                             terminates the phyiscal layer (e.g.  DSL
                             termination function or GPON termination
                             function), may physically aggregate other
                             nodes implementing such functionality, or
                             may perform both functions at the same
                             time.  This node contains at least one
                             standard Ethernet interface that serves as
                             its "northbound" interface into which it
                             aggregates traffic from several user ports
                             or Ethernet-based "southbound" interfaces.
                             It does not implement an IPv6 stack but

                             performs some limited inspection of IPv6
                             packets.
   Aggregation Network       The part of the network stretching from the
                             Access Nodes to the Edge Router.  In the
                             context of this document the aggregation
                             network is considered to be Ethernet based,
                             providing standard Ethernet interfaces at
                             the edges, for connecting the Access Nodes
                             and Broadband Network.  It is comprised of
                             ethernet switches that provide very limited
                             IP functionality (e.g.  IGMP snooping, MLD
                             snooping etc.).
   Edge Router               The Edge Router, also known as the
                             Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) is the
                             first IPv6 hop for the user.  In the cases
                             where the RG is bridged, the BNG acts as
                             the default router for the hosts behind the
                             RG.  In cases where the RG is routed, the
                             BNG acts as the default router for the RG
                             itself.  This node implements IPv6 router
                             functionality.
   GPON                      Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network is
                             an optical access network that has been

   Host                      A node that implements IPv6 host
                             functionality.
   RG                        A residential gateway device.  It can be a
                             Layer 3 (routed) device similar to one
                             specified in or a Layer 2 (bridged) device.
                             The residential gateway for Broadband Forum
                             networks is defined in [TR124]
   End-device                A node that sends Router Solicitations and
                             processes received Router Advertisements.
                             When a Layer 3 RG is used it is considered
                             an end-device in the context of this
                             document.  When a Layer 2 RG is used, the
                             host behind the RG is considered to be an
                             end-device in the context of this document.

2.  Issues with identifying the subscriber in an N:1 VLAN model

   In a DSL or GPON based fixed Broadband Network, IPv6 end-devices are
   connected to an Access Node (AN).  These end-devices today will
   typically send a Router Solicitation Message to the Edge Router, to
   which the Edge Router responds with a Router Advertisement message.
   The Router Advertisement typically contains a prefix that the end-
   devices will use to automatically configure an IPv6 Address.  Upon
   sending the Router Solicitation message the node connecting the end-
   device on the access circuit, typically an Access Node (AN), would
   forward the RS to the Edge Router upstream over a switched network.
   However, in such Ethernet-based aggregation networks, several
   subscriber premises may be connected to the same interface of an edge
   router (e.g. on the same VLAN).  However, the edge router requires
   some information to identify the end-device on the circuit line the
   end-device is connected on.  To accomplish this, the AN needs to add
   line identification information to the Router Solicitation message
   and forward this to the Edge Router.  This is analogous to the case
   where DHCP is being used, and the line identification information is
   inserted by a DHCP relay agent.  This document proposes a method for
   the edge router to identify the subscriber premises using the
   contents of the received Router Solicitation messages.


3.  Applicability

   The line identification option is intended to be used only for the
   N:1 VLAN deployment model.  For the other VLAN deployment models
   there is no need to carry line identification.


4.  Basic operation

   This document recommends tunneling Neighbor discovery packets inside
   another IPv6 packet that uses a destination option to convey line
   identification information.  The Neighbor discovery packets initiated
   by the end-device are left unmodified inside the encapsulating IPv6
   packet.  In particular, the Hop Limit field of the ND message is not
   decremented when the packet is being tunneled.  This is because ND
   messages whose Hop Limit is not 255 will be discarded by the receiver
   of such messages.

Internet-Draft          Line Identification in RS            August 2010


5.1.  On receiving a Router Solicitation from the end-device

   When an end-device sends out a Router Solicitation, it is received by
   the access node.  The AN then tunnels the received Router
   Solicitation in a newly created IPv6 datagram with the Link
   Identification Option (LIO).  The AN forms a new IPv6 datagram whose
   payload is the received Router Solicitation message as described in
   [RFC2473] except that the Hop Limit field of the Router Solicitation
   message MUST NOT be decremented.  If the AN has an IPv6 address, it
   SHOULD use this address in the Source Address field of the outer IPv6
   datagram.  Otherwise it MUST use the unspecified address as the
   Source Address of the outer IPv6 datagram.  The destination address
   of the outer IPv6 datagram MUST be copied from the destination
   address of the tunneled RS.  The AN MUST insert a destination options
   header between the outer IPv6 header and the payload.  It MUST insert
   a LIO destination option and set the line identification field of the
   option to contain the circuit identifier corresponding to the logical
   access loop port of the Access Node from which the RS was initiated.
   It MUST also insert the hardware address of the client (from the
   source hardware address of the RS) into the client hardware address
   field of the option.

5.2.  On receiving a Router Advertisement from the Edge Router

   Since the Router Advertisements are unicasted by the edge router
   towards the end-devices the access node does not need to intercept
   the downstream Router Advertisements.


6.  Edge Router Behavior

6.1.  On receiving a Router Solicitation from the Access Node

   When the edge router receives a tunneled Router Solicitation
   forwarded by the access node, it needs to check if there is an LIO
   destination option present in the outer datagram.  If an LIO option
   is present, the edge router MUST verify that the Option Length field
   of this option is set to ClientHWALen+LineIDLen+2.  If not the edge
   router MUST discard the tunneled Router Solicitation.  The edge
   router can use the contents of the line identification field to
   lookup the addressing information and policy that need to be applied
   to the line from which the Router Solicitation was received.  The
   edge router MUST then process the inner RS message as specified in
   [RFC4861]

Internet-Draft          Line Identification in RS            August 2010


6.2.  On sending a Router Advertisement towards the end-device

   When the edge router sends out a Router Advertisement in response to
   a tunneled RS that included an LIO option, it MUST unicast the RA at
   layer 2 back to the sender of the RS.  If the source address of the
   RS was the unspecified address, then the IPv6 destination address of
   the RA MUST be set to the all-nodes multicast address, other wise the
   IPv6 destination address is copied from the inner IPv6 source address
   of the Router Soliciation.  In both cases the link-layer destination
   address MUST be set to the unicast link-layer address which is in
   Client Hardware Address field in the LIO.


7.  Line Identification Option

   The Line Identification Option (LIO) is a destination option that can
   be included in IPv6 datagrams that tunnel Router Solicitation and
   Router Advertisement messages.  Multiple Line Identification options
   MUST NOT be present in the same IPv6 datagram.  The LIO has an
   alignment requirement of (none).

       for the line identification option will be allocated by the IANA.

    Option Length

       8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option (excluding
       the Option Type and Option Length fields). The value  0 is
       considered invalid.

    LineIDLen

       Length of the Line Identification field in number of octets.

    Line Identification

       Variable length data inserted by the Access Node describing the
       subscriber agent circuit identifier corresponding to the logical
       access loop port of the Access Node from which the RS was
       initiated.

    ClientHWALen

       Length of the Client Hardware Address in number of octets.

    Client Hardware Address

       Variable length client hardware address as detected by the
       access node.



8.  Interactions with Secure Neighbor Discovery

   Since the SEND [RFC3971] protected RS/RA packets are not modified in
   anyway by the mechanism described in this document, there are no
   issues with SEND verification.

10.  Security Considerations

   The line identification information inserted by the access node or
   the edge router is not protected.  This means that this option may be
   modified, inserted, or deleted without being detected.  In order to
   ensure validity of the contents of the line identification field, the
   network between the access node and the edge router needs to be
   trusted.


11.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new IPv6 destination option for carrying line
   identification.  IANA is requested to assign a new destination option
   type in the Destination Options registry maintained at

   http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-parameters

   <TBA> Line Identification Option [RFCXXXX]

   The act bits for this option need to be 10 and the chg bit needs to
   be 0.
