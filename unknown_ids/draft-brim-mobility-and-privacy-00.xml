    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Significant steps are being taken right now to make the Internet's
      architecture more scalable and robust in routing, addressing,
      multihoming, mobility, and locator/identifier separation.  However, since
      the Internet is rapidly becoming an essential part of daily life for
      people around the world, our architectural changes need to take
      fundamental social issues into account as a primary consideration.  One
      of those is privacy, and in this case particularly privacy of
      geographic location.
      If we do not, we run the risk of colliding with established IETF
      principles (see for example <xref target="RFC3693"></xref>) as well as
      public policy in many countries around the world.</t>

      <t>When the Internet was designed, IP addresses were associated
	with timesharing machines and not with particular users.  In
	the 1980s it began to be likely that a device and thus an IP
	address would be associated with a single user.  Now a single
	IP address is very likely to be associated with a single human
	being.  Meanwhile, at the top of the stack, there has been a
	convergence of life functions using single devices using
	single addresses.  A person now uses his or her personal device
	and associated IP address for many activities: work, shopping,
	talking, exchanging mail and files, reading, listening to
	music, etc.</t>

      <t>It is this convergence at both the top and bottom of the stack -- to
      a single person per device and to many applications on that device --
      that makes the social issues more and more significant in IETF work.
      People use the Internet for many, more personal, activities than before.
      The Internet needs to fulfill the obligations expected of a
      communications system essential to modern human society.  Our lower layer
      protocol designs have privacy implications beyond their intended
      scope.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="The Risks of Being Traceable">
      <t>Issues with revealing geographic location are
	well-established elsewhere.  For example the RAND review of
	the European Data Directive <xref target="RAND-EDPD"></xref>
	points out that "the interpretation of location data (e.g.
	which locations are visited, suggesting which shops are
	frequented, and which products and services are bought), may
	in the future permit the identification of the health, social,
	sexual or religious characteristics of the data subject"
	(section 3.3.1).  The less well-known problem that this
	document focuses on is tracing the movement of mobile devices.
	Because mobile devices are used for so many things, any
	possibility of tracing them has significant, probably
	unpredictable, social implications, perhaps more so than
	revealing a single location.  If an association can be made
	between a mobile device and a person at any location, if that
	device can be traced to a different geographic location then
	the association with the person can be inferred, usually
	correctly, even if the person believes they are anonymous at
	the new location. Consider scenarios such as:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>You are looking for a job, interviewing at other
	    companies over your lunch hour, but you don't want your
	    current management to know.</t>

          <t>You are planning a surprise gift or party for your spouse
	    and are visiting specialty stores.</t>

          <t>You are a journalist gathering information on a corrupt
	    politician from sources who wish to hide that they are
	    dealing with you.</t>

          <t>You are infiltrating an organized crime ring and don't
	    want them to know when you sneak in the back door of
	    police headquarters.</t>

          <t>You are a very famous person trying to avoid paparazzi
	    and assassins who are able to find you sporadically.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Mobility mechanisms need to take this issue into account.
	Obviously a mobile node must be reachable somehow, but a
	mobile node must be able to hide its actual movement from
	public view if it wishes.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Basic Mobility Requirements">
      <t>A mobile node may need to be reachable by others, or it may act
      purely as a client of Internet-based services.  Even if it is purely a
      client, it still needs at least two things:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>An authentication and authorization identifier that it can use
          with each access network it connects to.   (Not required for
          open access networks.)  </t>

          <t>A Layer 3 way for its correspondents to get packets back to it.
          This may no longer be simple due to potential innovations in routing
          architecture.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In addition, if the mobile node wants to be reachable as a peer or to
      offer services, it needs a few more things:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>An identifier (or identifiers) by which the node may be found by
          others, and a mechanism by which this identifier can be mapped to IP
          addresses/locators.  Examples are domain names, SIP URIs, and the
          corresponding services.</t>

          <t>An IP address/locator for initially contacting the mobile
	    node.  This does not have to be associated with the mobile
	    node's actual topological location.  It can instead be
	    associated with a rendezvous point or agent.
	  </t>

          <t>A mechanism for "route optimization", whereby such an agent can
          be eliminated from a data path between the mobile node and a
          correspondent.</t>

          <t>An identifier or identifiers by which the mobile node can
          authenticate itself to its correspondents during initial contact,
          route optimization, and/or change of topological location.  These
          identifiers can be at any layer, from 2 to 7.  They can be associated
          with the mobile device's whole IP stack, individual transport
          sessions, or individual application instances.</t>

          <t>Identifiers by which the mobile node can be referred to by third
          parties.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If all mobile nodes are reduced to being clients only -- if they are
      willing to register with servers in order to use the Internet and have
      others be able to reach them -- then there are fewer requirements.
      However, over the evolution of the Internet we have seen several times
      that it is not good to give up the symmetry of Internet communication
      and "permission-free" networking, i.e. the ability for anyone anywhere
      to communicate as a peer with other nodes on the Internet.  For the rest
      of this document we assume that the IETF still wants to retain this
      model.</t>

      <t>Every identifier listed above has a scope in which it needs to be
      known, but it is only required to be known in that scope.  For example,
      an access authentication identifier only needs to be known to the mobile
      node, the access network, and a trusted third party (a mobile node's
      home network administration, or a bank, etc.).  A session identifier only
      needs to be known among the parties using it, but not by the access
      network.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Avoiding Making a Mobile Node Traceable">
      <t>As a mobile node moves, if L3 or higher layer mobility mechanisms are
      used it will change its IP addresses/locators.  The Internet already has
      sophisticated publicly available services for determining where a node
      is based on IP address alone.  These mechanisms are not always precise or
      accurate, but they are in very many cases and even imprecise information
      is information.  Protocol designers must assume that whatever IP address
      or locator a node has, it is likely that there is a service to turn that
      into a geographic location.</t>

      <t>The tracing problem occurs when it is possible for a third
	party to correlate IP addresses/locators and something unique
	about the mobile node.  Data can be gathered either through
	monitoring traffic or by accessing public information.  It
	does not have to be done continuously -- periodic snapshots
	can make the mobile node just as vulnerable.  Once the data is
	gathered, the third party can search for correlations.
      </t>

      <t>Using identifiers for multiple purposes makes leakage of tracing
      information more likely.  Different entities in different scopes may know
      different things about a mobile node or a person.  Using overlapping
      identifiers mixes scopes and may make new, perhaps unexpected,
      correlations easier.  For example if an access identifier such as a
      mobile phone's IMEI (hard-coded and not changeable, primarily used for
      access authentication) is also used for session continuity, or is
      registered in an Internet database service that is publicly accessible,
      changes in that device's IP addresses (and thus geographic location) can be
      traced.</t>

      <t>Long-lasting identifiers make correlation easier as a device moves.
      They should not be used in scopes where they are not necessary.</t>

      <t>The biggest concern is if information that makes a mobile
	node traceable is required to be publicly available in order
	for the Internet to function.  If it is, it can be accessed
	not only without the mobile node's consent but even without
	its knowledge, perhaps without any audit trail of who is
	accessing the information that could be looked at after the
	fact.  Some architectures for mobility and/or routing and
	addressing described in <xref
	  target="I-D.irtf-rrg-recommendation"></xref> assume the use
	of DNS or other public mapping systems.  In these, the mobile
	node is required to publish a mapping between its identifier
	and its current IP addresses/locators in order to be
	reachable, even if a mobile node is acting purely as a client
	(because otherwise packets would not get back to it).  This
	architectural assumption removes all of the mobile node's
	freedom of choice about how much confidentiality to preserve
	-- either it exposes all of its movement to all of the world
	or it is simply not reachable.  Public information systems
	like DNS are not designed to support confidentiality.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-mext-rfc3775bis">MIPv6's "home
	  agent"</xref> is an example of how to avoid this problem:
	Contact with a mobile node is initially through a home agent,
	a rendezvous point for both data and control traffic.  The
	home agent acts on behalf of the mobile node and encapsulates
	traffic to it.  After an exchange of packets, the mobile node
	may decide, on its own, if it wants to reveal its topological
	location, and thus probably its geographic location, to the
	correspondent node.  It controls its own location information.
	The decision to reveal it can be based on anything, including
	local policy.</t>

      <t>The principle of hiding information that can expose
	geographic location in both data and control planes, and
	deferring revealing more until the mobile node or its agent decides
	what it wants to do, is essential.  This can be included in any
	mobility architecture that is designed to allow it and does
	not insist on exposing location to a wide audience in order to
	gain efficiency.  The obvious way to do it is an indirection
	mechanism such as a home agent, but this is just one way to do
	it.  Any way will do.</t>

      <t>Monitoring is a more subtle issue than exposure in public
	services, but still real, even if the mobile node is
	client-only.  If packets contain an identifier that uniquely
	identifies the mobile node for some period of time, someone
	able to gather data on packet traffic can easily trace the
	mobile node's movements as the IP address/locator changes.  It
	is not necessary for the watcher to be able to gather this
	information in real time if it can access logs gathered by
	others.  Here, approaches to the problem are more difficult
	to define because there is a conflict between three goals: to
	avoid overhead, to preserve session continuity with low delay,
	and to keep control over location information.  Some designs
	such already try to find their balance.  All protocol work
	should consider the tradeoffs with privacy and explicitly find
	a balance point.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Recommendations">
      <t>Members of the Internet community who are creating or reviewing
      proposed architectural changes, particularly in mobility but also in
      other areas that impinge on mobility such as routing and addressing,
      should consider the following points:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Architectural changes MUST avoid requiring exposing a mapping
          between any of a node's identifiers and IP addresses/locators to
          unknown observers.  If they require exposure, they will experience a
          head-on collision with basic principles of the IETF and with
          privacy policies around the world.  It will simply not be acceptable
          to require the loss of this much individual privacy.</t>

          <t>An architectural proposal MAY make it possible to use
	    public information systems to optimize traffic flow, but
	    ideally it should do so without sacrificing privacy.  If
	    it cannot do so without sacrificing privacy, the default
	    case built into the architecture SHOULD be to preserve
	    privacy instead of optimizing.  The reason is that most
	    users will not change defaults, and the default be one of
	    privacy, only moving away from it by customer choice.</t>

          <t>If possible, information about who is gathering data about a user
          SHOULD be available to that user.  Everyone deserves to know who is
          watching them.</t>

          <t>Proposals SHOULD address the issue of loss of geographic
	    location privacy due to monitoring of packets crossing the
	    Internet, and find an explicit balance between conflicting
	    goals.</t>

          <t>Protocols SHOULD avoid using identifiers for multiple purposes.
          Different identifier scopes do not need to overlap.  Confidentiality
          boundaries can be established by clearly defining limited
          interfaces.</t>

          <t>Protocols SHOULD avoid using long-lasting identifiers in scopes
          where they are not necessary.</t>
