INTERNET DRAFT  Pre-IETF RFCs Classifying: RFCs 101-200November 28, 2010


1. Introduction

   There are near 800 RFCs on the RFC Editor's archive with no definite
   status. This was caused by the time these RFCs were published at.
   Early RFCs (also called as 'Pre-IETF') were classified and marked
   according to RFC 100 [RFC100]. RFC 2026 [RFC2026] mentioned that all
   RFCs must be classified as 'Standards Track', 'Experimental',
   'Informational', 'Best Current Practice' or 'Historic'. In order to
   conform to this requirements, the series of document, which assign
   Pre-IETF RFCs to one of the aforementioned status, were made.

   This document classifies RFCs 101-200 in accordance with RFC 2026
   [RFC2026].


2. RFC Editor Considerations 

2.1. Informational RFCs Assignments

   RFC Editor is asked to mark following RFCs as 'Informational':

   RFC 101 [RFC101]

   RFC 108 [RFC108]

   RFC 124 [RFC124]

   RFC 132 [RFC132]

   RFC 160 [RFC160]

   RFC 164 [RFC164]

   RFC 170 [RFC170].

   The corresponding 'Status of this Memo' section is to be put in these
   documents. The following disclaimer should also be put in them:

   "Disclaimer

   The Informational category was assigned to this RFC in accordance to
   RFC-to-be. Note that original RFC did not contain the 'Status of this
   Memo' and this sections."

   [TO BE REMOVED: RFC Editor note:
                   The RFC-to-be should be changed to the RFC number,
                   assigned to this document.]

   RFC Editor is asked to mark the following RFC as Best Current
   Practice:
