Abstract

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) has an IANA registry to allocate
   cryptographic algorithm suites for use in generating digital
   signatures over DNS data.  Newly introduced cryptographic algorithms
   to DNSSEC mean implementors need to know which algorithms need to be
   implmented, which are optional, and which are obsolete.  This
   document adds a column to the IANA registry table for Domain Name
   System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers to list their status for
   use.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft              IANA-Registry-Fix               October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and
   [RFC4035] uses digital signatures over DNS data to provide source
   authentication and integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA
   registry to allocate codes for digital signature algorithm
   (consisting of a cryptographic algorithm and one-way hash function).
   Certain digital signature algorithms are considered MANDATORY to
   implement for interoperability while others are listed as OPTIONAL or
   OBSOLETE.

   Other DNSSEC documents have added new algorithms or changed the
   status of algorithms in the registry.  However, without reading all
   the documents, implementors must read through all the documents to
   discover which algorithms are MANDATORY to implement and which are
   OPTIONAL or obsolete.

   This document requests a column to be added to the IANA registry for
   Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers.  This column
   will list the current status of each digital signature algorithm in
   the registry.

2.  DNS Security Algorithm Number Subregisitry Fixes

   The DNS Security Algorithm Number subregistry (part of the Domain
   Name System (DNS) Security Number registry) will be modified to
   include a new column.  This column will contain the current
   implementation status of the given algorithm.  This status .  This
   document does not make any changes to any other column in the
   registry table.

   There are additional fixes to entries that are described in sub-
   section 2.1.  The overall new registry table is in sub-section 2.2.

2.1.  Individual Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Number
      Registry Entry Fixes

   This document changes three entries in the Domain Name System
   Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Registry.  They are:

   The description for allocation number 8 is changed to "Reserved until
   2020".

   The description for allocation number 9 is changed to "Reserved until
   2020".

   The description for allocation number 11 is changed to "Reserved
   until 2020".

2.2.  Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Number Registry

   As of the current time, the DNS Security Algorithm Number subregistry
   would look like the following:

   Newly allocated algorithms will need to state their intended status
   in their specification.  Any changes to a previously allocated
   algorithm's status MUST be done by a standards track document.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document consists entirely of DNS IANA Considerations and
   includes the following changes detailed in Section 2.1:

   The description of allocation 8 is changed from "Reserved for ECC" to
   "Reserved until 2020".

   The description of allocation 9 is changed from "Unassigned" to
   "Reserved until 2020".

   The description of allocation 11 is changed from "Unassigned" to
   "Reserved until 2020".

   The new table is in Section 2.2.  The Domain Name System (DNS)
   Security Algorithm Number registry is available at http://
   www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/
   dns-sec-alg-numbers.xhtml.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document seeks to add a column to an existing IANA registry.  It
   is not meant to be a discussion on algorithm superiority.  No new
   security considerations are raised in this document.
