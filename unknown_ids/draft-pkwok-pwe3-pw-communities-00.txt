Internet-Draft              PW Communities                    July 2011 
    

    [RFC4447] describes a set of procedures for Pseudowire set-up and       
    maintenance using LDP as signaling protocol. [DYN-MSPW} extends the 
    mechanisms described in [RFC4447] for dynamic placement of multi-  
    segment pseudowires.  

    This document describes an extension to [RFC4447] procedures which  
   may be used to pass additional information to S-PE/T-PEs when SS-PWs 
   or MS-PWs are set-up.   

    The intention of the proposed technique is to aid in policy  
    administration, specifically during MS-PW set-up across various  
    S-PEs. The proposed method is very generic so that it can support  
    the management of various parameters or rules while setting up  
    pseudowires with minimal overhead.

1. Introduction 

   A Multi-Segment PW (MS-PW) is defined as a set of two or more 
   contiguous segments that behave and function as a single point-to-
   point PW. An MS-PW enables service providers to extend the reach of 
   PWs across multiple PSN domains.  

   To facilitate and simplify the control of dynamic MS-PW set-up 
   across S-PEs, this document proposes a grouping or "coloring" of PWs 
   so that PW set-up decision can also be based on the identity of the 
   group. Such a scheme is expected to significantly simplify dynamic 
   MS-PW signaling [DYN-MSPW] that controls the MS-PW set-up across the 
   Switching Provider Edge (S-PE) devices. 

   MS-PW spans across multiple autonomous systems or administrative 
   domains. For security reasons, strict access control is required at 
   S-PEs through which a PW enters another administrative domain. One 
   way is for operators to define a policy at the S-PE that would match 
   the PW set-up requests based on Target Attachment Individual 
   Identifier (TAII) or Source Attachment Individual Identifier (SAII)

   or Attachment Group Identifier (AGI) etc.  Such policies can be 
   complex or very large, leading to administrative overheads or 
   configuration mistakes. Rather, operators could define several 
   tags/colors which can be associated with individual PWs when they 
   are signaled. S-PEs can then apply PW policies based on the received 
   tags, accordingly. This example application eliminates the primary 
   motivation for a complex policy database that may result in the 
   generation of very large PW prefix-based filter rules. A smaller 
   policy database such as this also requires less maintenance, so 
   shortening or eliminating out-of-band maintenance delays.  

   Another application of PW policies is in underlying transport 
   applications. Each S-PE independently chooses a unidirectional PSN 
   tunnel to map a set of PW segments to their next S-PE or T-PE. Such 
   PSN Tunnels could be Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036] or 
   Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) 
   [RFC3209] or Labeled BGP [RFC3107] based LSPs. There is currently no 
   signaling support in [DYN-MSPW] to signal a preference for the type 
   of PSN tunnel to bind a PW to at the S-PEs when multiple tunnel 
   types are available. For example, LDP can be preferred over BGP 
   tunnels when both forms of tunnels are available at an S-PE. 
   Secondly, it is also possible that only a specific RSVP tunnel is 
   preferable to provide a traffic class or QoS treatment, or 
   protection capability, and some form of control is required that 
   LSPs are correctly used by S-PEs. One possible way is to manually 
   configure filter rules by PW ID or AGI/SAII/TAII, but such rules can 
   create significant maintenance overhead and be prone to 
   configuration errors.  Further, signaling each of the various types 
   of PSN tunnel selection criteria/preferences in PW set-up messages 
   adds significant burden to LDP label mapping procedures. 

   To address such policy management issues, this draft proposes a very 
   simple solution that allows minimal manual intervention and 
   configuration with no overhead in PW signaling. It introduces a 
   concept of "PW Communities" that can be thought of as templates 
   provisioned at a S-PE/T-PE,  based on which of a certain set of 
   rules are applied to all PWs that are tagged as belonging to same 
   community.  

   Note that PW Community is different from PW Grouping (as defined 
   using PW Group ID) defined in [RFC4447]. PW Grouping is associated 
   with binding of a set of PWs to a common event group for reduced 
   signaling of various intensive events such as Label withdraw or PW 
   Status Notification etc. However, PW Communities can be thought of a 
   coloring of PWs from policy management perspective.   It is not 
   necessary that PW Grouping and PW Communities associated with a PW 
   be corelated.

2. Conventions used in this document 

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 0. 

3. PW Communities 

   The PW Community attribute is carried in an Interface Parameters 
   Sub-TLV as follows:  

     0                   1                   2                   3 

       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      | Parameter ID  |     Length    |      PW Community ID          | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |       PW Community ID         | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
      Parameter ID = 0x18 
      
      Length       = 4 
    
      PW Community ID = 32 bit identifier for the community to which  
                        the PW belongs to. 

   A PW community can be considered as a template that has a set of 
   rules defined locally by a T-PE or S-PE. Each T-PE or S-PE can 
   define its own set of rules and its upto the administrative domain 
   to maintain congruities among PW community rules through which PW 
   set-up process would follow. A LDP peer may use this interface 
   parameter to control information it accepts, prefers or distributes 
   to other peers. 

   A LDP peer receiving a PW set-up request (label mapping message) 
   that does not carry the PW Community MAY append a PW community TLV 
   when propagating the label mapping message to next S-PE/T-PE. 

   A LDP peer receiving a PW set-up request with PW Community MAY 
   modify the PW community according to local policy while propagating 
   the request to the next-hop.

4. Security Considerations 

   This document does not impose additional security considerations to 
   what is defined in [RFC5036],[RFC4447] and [DYN-MSPW]. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   This document proposes a PW Community Interface Parameters Sub-TLV, 
   with a proposed type of 0x18, to be allocated from the PWE3 
   Pseudowire Interface Parameters sub-TLV type registry.
