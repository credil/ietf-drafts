Abstract 

   This document describes the use of SEED block cipher algorithm in the 
   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol [3] for confidentiality to the

1. Introduction 

1.1. SEED 

   SEED [2] is a national industrial association standard [7] and is 
   widely used in South Korea for electronic commerce and financial 
   services that are operated on wired and wireless communications. 

   SEED is a 128-bit symmetric key block cipher that had been developed 
   by KISA(Korea Information Security Agency) and a group of experts 
   since 1998. The input/output block size of SEED is 128-bit and the 
   key length is also 128-bit. SEED has the 16-round Feistel structure. 
   A 128-bit input is divided into two 64-bit blocks and the right 64-
   bit block is an input to the round function with a 64-bit subkey 
   generated from the key scheduling. 

   SEED is easily implemented in various software and hardware because 
   it is designed to increase the efficiency of memory storage and the 
   simplicity in generating keys without degrading the security of the 
   algorithm. In particular, it can be effectively adapted to a 
   computing environment with restricted resources such as mobile 
   devices, smart cards and so on.

1.2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 

    

2. Cipher Suite Definitions 

2.1. Cipher 

   All the cipher suites described here use SEED in cipher block 
   chaining (CBC) mode as a bulk cipher algorithm. This mode requires an 
   Initialization Vector IV) that is the same size as the block size. 
   The IV MUST be chosen at random and MUST be unpredictable. 

2.2. Key Size and Number of Rounds 

   SEED supports 128-bit key and has the 16-round Feistel structure. 

2.3. Block Size and Padding 

   SEED uses a block size of 16 octets (128 bits). 

   Padding is required by SEED to maintain a 16-octet (128-bit) 
   blocksize. Padding must be added such that the data to be encrypted 
   has a length that is a multiple of 16 octets. 

2.4. Hash 

   All the cipher suites described here use SHA-1 [8] in an HMAC 
   construction. 

2.5. Performance 

   Performance figures of SEED are available at 
   http://www.kisa.or.kr/seed/seed_eng.html. 

    

3. Security Considerations 

   No security problem has been found on SEED. SEED is secure against 
   all known attacks including Differential cryptanalysis, linear 
   cryptanalysis, and related key attacks. The best known attack is only

   considerations, the reader is encouraged to read [4], [5], and [6].
