Abstract

   To support IP multicasting in PMIPv6 domain, [I-D.ietf-multimob-
   pmipv6-base-solution] has been determined as a base solution. This
   solution requires all the LMA to forward multicast packets to MAG via
   PMIPv6 tunnel. This approach creates a tunnel convergence problem. To
   resolve the issue, the current MULTIMOB WG charter is trying to draw
   a solution about how to separate multicasting routing from a mobility
   anchor. As an effective solution, we propose the direct routing
   approach that makes the direct connection between MAG and multicast
   router. The advantages of the proposed direct routing solution are
   compared with the base solution and dedicated LMA approach. This
   draft is derived and revised from [I-D.sijeon-multimob-mms-pmip6] as
   re-chartered MULTIMOB WG description.

1. Introduction

   PMIPv6 is a network-based IP mobility protocol that requires no host
   stack involvements; it provides enhanced mobility performance
   compared to host-based approaches like MIPv6, FMIPv6. However,
   current PMIPv6 specification does not explicitly address the method
   of multicasting communications [RFC5213].

   To support multicasting in PMIPv6 domain, the base solution proposes
   deployment option [I-D.ietf-multimob-pmipv6-base-solution], which
   places multicast routing on LMA. MAG receives a multicast stream from
   LMA by using PMIPv6 tunnel. It is simply derived from PMIPv6
   specification and requires no modification to PMIPv6 components and
   MNs. However, the base solution introduces a tunnel convergence issue
   in case a MAG receives the same multicast packets from more than one
   LMA. This causes severe network bandwidth. To avoid a tunnel
   convergence problem, the current MULTIMOB WG charter is trying to d a
   solution on how to separate multicasting routing from the mobility
   anchor. As potential techniques, two kinds of approaches have been
   presented: a dedicated mobility anchor and direct routing.

   The concept of dedicated LMA is to assign dedicated multicasting LMA
   to each MAG. This approach resolves tunnel convergence issues;
   however, PMIPv6 tunnel is also used. It imposes a heavy burden on a
   multicasting LMA to process and forward tunnel packets to several
   MAGs. Additionally, it incurs severe packet tunneling overhead.

   In this draft, we propose a direct routing solution that a MAG
   receives multicast packets directly from MR with no tunnel. This
   solution can completely solve tunnel-related performance issues
   introduced from the base solution and dedicated LMA solution.

          Figure 1. Direct routing solution for PMIPv6 Multicasting

   Figure 1 shows the proposed direct routing architecture using native
   multicasting infrastructure [I-D.deng-multimob-pmip6-requirement]. To
   forward IGMP/MLD signaling and multicast packets, a MLD proxy
   function defined in [RFC4605], SHOULD be placed on a MAG. This
   solution is much simpler than the base solution and easy to deploy
   because multicasting functions are totally separated from mobility
   anchor by using a native multicasting infrastructure.

   the newly arrived MN and transmits an MLD query message to the MN.
   After receiving the MLD query message, the MN sends an MLD report
   message that includes the multicast group information. The N-MAG then
   sends an aggregated MLD report message to the MR. When the N-MAG
   receives the multicast packets from the MR, it then simply forwards
   them without tunnel encapsulation. The N-MAG updates the MN's
   location information to the LMA by exchanging PBU/PBA signaling
   messages.

4. Comparison with Base Solution, Dedicated LMA, and Direct Routing

   In this section, we compare the direct routing with the base solution
   [I-D.ietf-multimob-pmipv6-base-solution] and dedicated LMA [I-D.
   zuniga-multimob-smspmip] in terms of performance, ease of deployment,
   and other factors.

4.1. Tunnel Convergence

   In the base solution, the MR function is combined with LMA. Thus, all
   the packets are delivered to MNs through PMIPv6 tunnel between MAG
   and LMA, which raises the tunnel convergence problem. because a MAG
   may receive the same multicast packets from several LMAs. Dedicated
   LMA and the proposed direct routing have different approaches;
   however, they can avoid the tunnel convergence issue.

4.2. Complexity in LMA

   In the tunnel-based approaches, a LMA needs to deal with MLD
   signaling, join/leave procedure, and tunnel packet processing (i.e.,
   encapsulating/decapsulating and tunnel packet lookup) as well as the
   role of mobility anchor. When using a dedicated entity, these
   complexities can be reduced but cannot be avoided completely. On the
   other hand, the direct routing is absolutely not affected by these
   complexities.

4.3. Packet Overhead

   With native multicasting infrastructure, direct routing does not make
   any packet overhead while tunnel-based approaches bring about
   tunneling overhead per packet. Tunneling overhead could become severe
   as the packet arrival rate increases.

Internet-Draft         PMIPv6 Multicasting Support            March 2011


4.4. Another Advantage

   When we consider that MNs move to non-PMIPv6 domains from PMIPv6
   domains as described in [I-D.von-hugo-multimob-future-work], the
   direct routing approach can provide a compatible method because it
   does not depend on PMIPv6 tunnel for multicasting operation.

5. Message Formats

   This section describes source and destination address of MLD
   signaling messages. The interface A-B means that an interface on node
   A, which is connected to node B.

   This document does not discuss any special security concerns in
