Abstract 

   IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) is one of the most popular methods to 
   provide both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously 
   during the IPv4/IPv6 co-existing period. The Dynamic Host 
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 6rd option has been defined to 
   configure 6rd Customer Edge (CE). However, in many networks, the 
   configuration information may be stored in Authentication 
   Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers while user configuration 
   is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) through DHC protocol. 
   This document defines a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service 
   (RADIUS) attribute that carries 6rd configuration information from 
   AAA server to BNG.

1. Introduction 

   Recently providers start to deploy IPv6 and consider how to transit 
   to IPv6. IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) [RFC5969] is one of the most 
   popular methods to provide both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity services 
   simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-existing period. 6rd is used 
   to provide IPv6 connectivity service through legacy IPv4-only 
   infrastructure. 6rd adopt Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
   as auto-configuring protocol. The 6rd Customer Edge (CE) extends DHCP 
   option to discover 6rd border relay and to configure IPv6 prefix and 
   address. 

   In many networks, user configuration information may be managed by 
   AAA servers, together with user Authentication, Authorization, and 
   Accounting (AAA). Current AAA servers communicate using the Remote 
   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) [RFC2865] protocol. 
   In a fixed line broadband network, the Broadband Network Gateways 
   (BNGs) act as the access gateway of users. The BNGs are assumed to 
   embed a DHCP server function that allows them to locally handle any 
   DHCP requests issued by hosts. 

   Since the 6rd configuration information is stored in AAA servers and 
   user configuration is mainly through DHC protocol between BNGs and 
   hosts. New RADIUS attributes are needed to propagate the information 
   from AAA servers to BNGs. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

   The terms 6rd CE and 6rd Border Relay are defined in [RFC5969]. 

3. IPv6 6rd Configuration with RADIUS 

   The below Figure 1 illustrates how the RADIUS protocol and DHCP 
   cooperate to provide 6rd CE with 6rd configuration information.

                Figure 1: the cooperation between DHCP and RADIUS 

   BNGs act as a client of RADIUS and as a DHCP server for DHC protocol. 
   First, a BNG receives a DHCPDISCOVER from the 6rd CE. It initiates 
   the BNG to request correspondent user authentication relevant from an 
   AAA server using RADIUS protocol. A 6rd configuration request may be 
   also sent in the same message. If the user authentication is approved 
   by the AAA server, an Access-Accept message is acknowledged with the 
   IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute, defined in the next Section. After 
   the BNG responds to the user with an Advertise  
   message, the user requests for a 6rd Option. Then, the BNG can reply 
   the user using DHCP protocol. 

   Figure 2 describes another scenario, in which the authentication 
   operation is not coupled with DHCP. In the authentication stage, the 
   BNG obtains the 6rd configuration information from the AAA server 
   through RADIUS protocol. When the user requests the 6rd Option, the 
   BNG replies with a 6rd option in DHCPACK.

   After receiving the IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute in the initial 
   Access-Accept, the BNG MUST store the received 6rd configuration 
   parameters locally. When the 6rd Customer Edge sends a DHCP Request 
   message to request an extension of the lifetimes for the assigned 
   address, the BNG does not have to initiate a new Access-Request 
   towards the AAA server to request the 6rd configuration parameters. 
   The BNG retrieves the previously stored 6rd configuration parameters 
   and use them in its reply. 

   If the DHCP server to which the DHCP Request message was sent at time 
   T1 has not responded, the DHCP client enters the REBINDING state and 
   attempts to contact any server. In this scenario the BNG receiving 
   the DHCP message MUST initiate a new Access-Request towards the AAA 
   server. The BNG MAY include the IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute in 
   its Access-Request. If the BNG does not receive the IPv6-6rd-
   Configuration Attribute in the Access-Accept it MAY fallback to a 
   pre-configured default 6rd configuration, if any. If the BNG does not 
   have any pre-configured default 6rd configuration or if the BNG 
   receives an Access-Reject, the tunnel cannot be established. 

4. Attributes 

   This section defines IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute which is used 
   in the 6rd scenario. The attribute design follows [RFC6158]. 

4.1. IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute 

   The IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute is structured as follows (The 
   specification requires that multiple IPv4 addresses are associated 
   strongly with one IPv6 prefix. Given that RADIUS currently has no 
   recommended way of grouping multiple attributes, the below design 
   appears to be a reasonable compromise.):

       6rdBRIPv4Address 

         One or more IPv4 addresses of the 6rd Border Relay(s) for a 
         given 6rd domain. The maximum RADIUS Attribute length of 255 
         octets results in a limit of 58 IPv4 addresses. 

   The IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute MAY be used in Access-Request 
   packets as a hint to the RADIUS server; for example if the BNG is 
   pre-configured with a default 6rd configuration, these parameters MAY 
   be inserted in the attribute. The RADIUS server MAY ignore the hint 
   sent by the BNG and it MAY assign different 6rd parameters. 

   If the BNG includes the IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute, but the AAA 
   server does not recognize it, this attribute MUST be ignored by the 
   AAA Server.

   If the BNG does not receive IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute in the 
   Access-Accept it MAY fallback to a pre-configured default 6rd 
   configuration, if any. If the BNG does not have any pre-configured 
   default 6rd configuration, the 6rd tunnel can not be established. 

   If the BNG is pre-provisioned with a default 6rd configuration and 
   the 6rd configuration received in Access-Accept is different from the 
   configured default, then the 6rd configuration received in the 
   Access-Accept message MUST be used for the session. 

   If the BNG cannot support the received 6rd configuration for any 
   reason, the tunnel SHOULD NOT be established. 

4.2. Table of attributes 

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found 
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

                                                   Configuration 

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries. 

   0     This attribute MUST NOT be present in packet. 
   0+    Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in 
         packet. 
   0-1   Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present in 
         packet. 
   1     Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present in 
         packet. 

5. Diameter Considerations 

   This attribute is usable within either RADIUS or Diameter [RFC3588]. 
   Since the Attributes defined in this document will be allocated from 
   the standard RADIUS type space, no special handling is required by 
   Diameter entities. 

6. Security Considerations 

   In 6rd scenarios, the RADIUS protocol is run over IPv4. Known 
   security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol are discussed in RFC 
   2607 [RFC2607], RFC 2865 [RFC2865], and RFC 2869 [RFC2869]. Use of 
   IPsec [RFC4301] for providing security when RADIUS is carried in IPv6 
   is discussed in RFC 3162 [RFC3162].

   Security considerations for the Diameter protocol are discussed in 
   RFC 3588 [RFC3588]. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document requires the assignment of one new RADIUS Attribute 
   Types in the "Radius Types" registry (currently located at 
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types for the following 
   attributes: 

      o  IPv6-6rd-Configuration 

   IANA should allocate the number from the standard RADIUS Attributes 
   space using the "IETF Review" policy [RFC5226].
