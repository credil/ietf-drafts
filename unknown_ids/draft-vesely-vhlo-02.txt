Abstract

   This memo defines an extension to the SMTP service that provides
   protocol support for weak authentication of SMTP clients.  Weakly
   authenticated clients enjoy an intermediate level of trust: they have

   no relying privileges, but can attempt to deliver mail to local
   users, are whitelisted from some filters, and may receive DSNs as
   needed.

   Note that this treatment is what SMTP recommends for all clients.
   However, most servers operate filters to limit spam, thereby
   affecting the reliability of the mail forwarding system.  Verified-
   Hello aims at providing standard support for the mechanisms involved,
   so that they can be managed and branded.

1.  Context and notes for this draft

   This section is to be removed in case this document ever makes it to
   the RFC Editor.

   The ideas presented in this document stem from suggestions made by
   John Klensin on the ietf-smtp mailing list maintained at imc.org.

   Two messages bearing such suggestions:

   http://www.imc.org/ietf-smtp/mail-archive/msg05423.html
   http://www.imc.org/ietf-smtp/mail-archive/msg05444.html


2.  Introduction

2.1.  Content filtering

   Email Service Providers have to resort to content filters to limit
   the amount of spam.  Such filters apply heuristic criteria, such as
   statistical analysis of the words in the message body, for
   determining a message's worthiness.  Messages that are deemed not
   worth the recipient's attention, may happen to be delivered inside
   hidden or junk folders, or quarantined, so that the recipients will
   not notice them.  (Reporting a delivery failure is not an option when
   the sender is not trusted, because the Return-Path is most likely
   forged.)

   There has been a time when content filtering was considered a
   panacea.  Until machines will be unable to properly understand the
   content of mail message, that assumption will remain wrong and
   deceiving.  Even if machines could understand human language, having
   to undergo their censorship may be inadvisable.  In addition, the
   reasons why users may not want to read a mail message vary widely,
   and no definition of spam has been universally agreed upon.  Hence,
   discarding spam conflicts with reliability, and using content filters
   to detect spam worsen that even more.

   This is not to say that content filters are useless.  There are
   several situations where they can be used to discern messages so as
   to deliver them to different persons in a given group, or to
   different folders in a user's mailbox.  The relevant point is that
   those filters fail every now and then, therefore their use is safe
   only when the recipients can easily cope with those failures.
   Content filtering can be safely used to determine which persons
   and/or folders a message is delivered to, because a human will
   eventually read the message and correct any filtering malfunction.

2.2.  Prime delivery

   The term "prime delivery" is used to indicate that a message is not
   tagged as spam, quarantined, silently dropped, or delivered in
   folders from where unread messages can be deleted without human
   intervention (junk folders).  In addition, the message is not edited
   by changing or altering its headers so as to make it less visible or
   discourage users from displaying its content.

   Prime delivery implies strict [RFC5321] conformance, rather than
   acceptance of the message.  In case the message has to be forwarded
   to another internal or external server, its transmission SHALL
   attempt to preserve the trust and reputation that was granted on
   acceptance, as detailed in Section 5.  Failure to do so MUST be
   reported as indicated by [RFC5321].

2.3.  Domains, weak authorization, and branding

   The concept of an ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD) is
   described in [I-D.crocker-email-arch] as an actor having its own
   administrative authority.  For the purposes of this document, an ADMD
   may be identified as a set of hosts sharing the same policies and
   possibly coordinated with one another.

   DNS domain names are delegated to organizations or individuals.
   Thus, in the simple cases, an ADMD corresponds to one or more DNS
   domain names, the association being recognizable by registrant name
   in whois databases records.  However, privacy concealments and
   virtual hosts complicate this topic enough to discourage easy
   categorizations.

   Global communications require that SMTP servers accept mail coming
   from unknown hosts.  This requirement rules out strong authentication
   schemes, because, by definition, it is not possible to authenticate
   unknown entities.  Historically, Internet protocols granted some
   trust to any host, as sporting a global IP address was deemed a
   sufficient credential.  When more restrictive criteria became
   required, a number of mechanisms has emerged to provide for weak
   authentication.  It means that the sender can be recognized as being
   branded in such a way that its reputation can be estimated.  First of
   all, a domain name can be used as a brand.  In this respect,
   reputation records based on domain names last longer than those based
   on IP addresses, while it is relatively easy to ensure that a given
   IP address belongs to, or is authorized by, a given domain.  In
   addition, some mechanisms reference a different domain that makes
   explicit assertions about the reputation of the sender.

   The mechanisms considered in this memo involve DNSBL, SPF, MX, rDNS,

   VBR, and DKIM.  Thus, we have a huge number of domains that host
   mailboxes, a somewhat smaller number of domains that give reputation
   indications, and a small number of mechanisms.  By standardizing
   these mechanisms, and possibly further ones, VHLO allows senders to
   know beforehand the reputation and whitelisting treatment that the
   receiving server will grant to the mail messages that they are about
   to transmit.  It provides means to let the senders know any reasons
   why weak authentication failed, which is important in order to manage
   the evolution of mechanisms and brands.  (Letting a sender know what
   checks a server performs is a risk only in case of security through
   obscurity.  A mechanism which is secure by design does not have to be
   kept secret.)  Finally, VHLO eases Greylisting.

2.4.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Definition and Registration of the VHLO Extension

   According to [RFC5321] provisions, the definition for this extension
   goes as follows:

   o  the textual name of this extension is "Verified Hello";

   o  the EHLO keyword associated with the extension is "VHLO";

   o  the parameter associated with the EHLO keyword is a random value
      up to 16 octets long (see Section 4.3.1.1);

   o  this extension defines one additional verb, VHLO, whose only
      mandatory parameter is the Domain name of the sender's ADMD,
      possibly followed by one parameter for each reputation tag (see
      Section 4.1);

   o  VHLO is also defined as one additional parameter to the MAIL verb
      (see Section 4.3.1.1), no parameters are defined for the RCPT
      verb;

   o  supporting the extension affects the behavior of a server and
      client SMTP as described in Section 4; and

   o  the maximum length of the MAIL command is increased by 22 octets,
      while the RCPT command is not affected.

   Finally, as required by [RFC4409], this extension is NOT RECOMMENDED

Internet-Draft                    VHLO                         June 2009


   on the Submission port.


4.  Behavior of SMTP client and server

   The VHLO command is used by a client to request prime delivery of
   messages.  If the server accepts the command by giving a positive
   response (see Section 4.3.1), all messages transmitted thereafter
   until either the end of the session or a further successful VHLO
   command are considered in the framework of the former VHLO command.

   An SMTP client MAY issue the VHLO command as part of a session
   initiation, before initiating a mail transaction.  That is to say,
   right after the EHLO command, or instead of it.  (In the latter case,
   of course, the client has to infer that the server supports this
   extension by some other means.)  Clients MAY attempt the VHLO command
   various times with different parameters, as long as the receiving
   server allows further retries (see Section 4.3.3).  Clients failing
   to issue a successful VHLO command MAY rely on the EHLO command
   instead.  If the server supports VHLO and issued reply codes 550 or
   553, and the client's configuration includes a list of alternative
   MSAs, the client SHOULD relay through an alternative MSA.

   After successfully transmitting one or more messages in the framework
   of a successful VHLO command, a client MAY issue another VHLO command
   to transmit more messages.  Changing framework is required when new
   messages are transmitted on behalf of a different Domain, or with
   different VHLO parameters.

   The receiving server MUST ensure prime delivery of the messages
   accepted in the framework of a successful VHLO command.  These
   messages are subject to MAIL FROM restriction, and, possibly, to
   DKIM-Signature headers existence and verification, VBR restriction,
   and Greylisting restrictions (see Section 4.4).

4.1.  Syntax of the VHLO command

   The only mandatory argument to VHLO is Domain.  The syntax is as
   follows:

   vhlo            = "VHLO" SP Domain *( SP auth-rept-claim) CRLF

   auth-rept-claim = auth-rept-tag [ ":" tag-spec-param ]

   auth-rept-tag   = "GID" / "MX" / "PTR" / "VBR" / "DKIM" / further-tag

   tag-spec-param  = gid-param / vbr-param / dkim-param / further-param

Internet-Draft                    VHLO                         June 2009


   where the Domain is the fully-qualified DNS domain name delegated to
   the entity or organization that is responsible for sending the
   message(s) that will be transmitted in the framework of this command.
   Note that, unlike the EHLO command, the Domain is not necessarily the
   host name of the SMTP client.

   The maximum line length of the VHLO command is 1000 octets, including
   the terminating CRLF.

   The GID auth-rept-tag and its associated gid-param SHOULD be supplied
   in the special cases described in sections Greylisting check, and
   Greylisting restrictions.

   The remaining arguments MAY be supplied to authenticate the domain
   name or provide hints for its reputation.  These arguments are
   supplied spontaneously by the client, up to the maximum line length.

4.2.  Server side checks on the Domain

   The receiving server SHOULD check that the supplied domain is valid
   and reckon its reputation.

   The server is not limited by the checking methods indicated in the
   parameters.  In particular, it is RECOMMENDED that DNSBL, 'iprev',
   and SPF checks are carried out anyway.  While this section indicates
   circumstances for the failure of each single check, it is up to the
   local policy to establish what combinations of successful checks
   yield positive responses.

   Some circumstances may require to terminate a VHLO framework and
   start a new one, with varied Domain or parameters.  Typically, only a
   part of the checks need to be carried out again.

4.2.1.  Greylisting check

   The GID auth-rept-tag provides the value of a VHLO framework that had
   been given by this same server or a related MX during a previous SMTP
   session:

   gid-param       = original-vhlo-string

   The receiving server SHOULD check that the original-vhlo-string
   corresponds to the value that it or a related MX has given as random-
   string in response to a successful VHLO command.  Use of the GID
   auth-rept-tag is reserved for retrying the transmission of messages
   that suffered a transient failure in the framework of the
   corresponding VHLO command, as described in section Section 4.3.1.1.

Internet-Draft                    VHLO                         June 2009


   If the server applies Greylisting[greylisting], it MAY use the
   provided gid-param, if supplied, as an additional key to a group of
   messages, besides other data items used to implement Greylisting.  If
   using this parameter, the server MUST still check that the other data
   items correspond, and that the sender accomplishes the directives
   described in Greylisting restrictions.

   The server SHOULD NOT issue a negative response for improper usage of
   this parameter.  However, if bad faith can be ascertained, the server
   MAY add that knowledge to the sending Domain's reputation.  On the
   other hand, using this parameter eases the task of verifying that a
   Domain's servers adopt a regular retrying behavior.  Such knowledge
   MAY also be added to the Domain's reputation.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   Domains with enough reputation are whitelisted from Greylisting.

4.2.2.  DNSBL check

   The server SHOULD check any relevant DNSBL, and, if a DNSBL that the
   server, according to its policy, considers trustworthy for either
   rejecting messages or degrading their worthiness, gives a positive
   match, then the server SHOULD issue a negative response.  See
   [I-D.irtf-asrg-dnsbl] for details on this check.

4.2.3.  SPF check

   If the server carries out SPF checks, it SHOULD check the supplied
   Domain using the method described in [RFC4408], and, if that results
   in a "fail", the server SHOULD issue a negative response.  According
   to its policy, the server MAY issue a negative response when the
   result is anything but "pass".

   Note that the so-called "helo check" often gets a result of "none"
   because [RFC4408] does not provide for SPF (or TXT) RRs to be valid
   for a whole zone, and many hostmasters omit to define an SPF policy
   for each host.  Unlike EHLO, the Domain argument taken by VHLO points
   to the sending domain, not the host.  Because of the MAIL FROM
   restriction, no further SPF checks are required for transactions in
   the framework of this VHLO command.

4.2.4.  MX check

   The MX auth-rept-tag suggests that the client is connecting from an
   IP address that belongs to one of the Domain's MX servers.  The
   receiving server SHOULD lookup the MX records of the given Domain and
   successively lookup the addresses (A or AAAA depending on the
   connection) of each of the hosts listed therein, until it finds a
   matching address or the list is exhausted.  If no match was found,
   the server SHOULD issue a negative response.

4.2.5.  PTR and 'iprev' checks

   The PTR auth-rept-tag suggests that the client is connecting from an
   IP address that can be resolved backward to an host name under the
   given Domain's hierarchy.  Note that this also works for Top Level
   Domains or branches of ccTLDs whose ADMDs run no mail services, hence
   the added delegation check.

   The receiving server SHOULD lookup the PTR records for the connecting
   address and verify that at least one of the returned RRs contains a
   host name whose rightmost part matches the Domain.  In addition, the
   authoritative Name Server for the Domain must match the NS for the
   host name thus found; that is, the Domain and the sending host share
   the same NS.  If no match was found, the server SHOULD issue a
   negative response.

   The server SHOULD also check that the name found thereby resolves
   forward, possibly through a CNAME, to the connecting address, as
   indicated by the 'iprev' Authentication Method described in
   [RFC5451].

4.2.6.  VBR check

   The VBR auth-rept-tag provides a list of vouching services:

   vbr-param       = [ "mc=" type-string ";" "mv=" ] certifier-list

   certifier-list  = domain-name *( ":" domain-name )

   The receiving server SHOULD carry out the VBR validation process as
   it would be done for a VBR-Info header containing the corresponding
   elements, see [RFC5518].

4.2.7.  DKIM check

   The DKIM auth-rept-tag asserts that all messages transmitted in the
   framework of this VHLO command (in case it is successful) have a
   DKIM-Signature header whose domain (d) or identity (i) tag matches
   the Domain in the VHLO command.  The parameter contains additional
   properties of such signatures:

   See [RFC4871] for imported ABNF

   dkim-param      = sig-s-tag *( ";" sig-tag )

   where the sig-s-tag is the s=selector string, while the optional sig-
   tag's are selected parts of the DKIM-Signature header.  Note that the
   parameter MUST NOT contain any whitespace, although it is allowed in

   the signature header.  At least the sig-s-tag for the selector (and
   the sig-q-tag if a query method different than "dns/txt" is used)
   MUST be provided.  The algorithm (a) and the header list (h) tags
   might also possibly be used by the server to reckon reputation.

   The receiving server MAY fetch the public key required to verify the
   DKIM signatures.  If the key does not exist, the server SHOULD issue
   a negative response.

4.3.  Responses to the VHLO command

   An ADMD accepts incoming mail messages according to some policies.
   The requisites for according a positive reply to a VHLO command
   SHOULD NOT be less strict than those for accepting an incoming
   message.  In particular, if a policy states that certain conditions
   imply that a message would be accepted with some reserves, it should
   likely state that VHLO is denied under the same conditions.

   When processing the optional auth-rept-claim's parameters, the server
   MUST ignore any parameter whose tag it does not support or
   understand.

   In case of unsuccessful response, the server retains its previous
   state.

4.3.1.  Positive response

   If the checks carried out on the Domain and the connection indicate
   that the server will wholeheartedly accept messages from the client,
   the server returns a 250 reply code.  The response is a multi-line
   response with the same format as the EHLO response (ehlo-ok-rsp in
   [RFC5321]), with the keywords for all the SMTP extensions available
   as a consequence of entering this VHLO framework.

   Upon a positive response, the client MUST reset any flags and
   variables associated to SMTP extensions that it may have since
   previous EHLO or VHLO commands in the same session.

4.3.1.1.  VHLO parameter and MAIL FROM command

   The server response to the VHLO and EHLO commands includes the VHLO
   keyword along with a randomly generated token of up to 16 octets.
   The format of the relevant line is as follows:

   ehlo-line       = "VHLO" SP random-string

   random-string   = 1*16( %d33-60 / %d62-126 )
                   ; any CHAR excluding "=", SP, and control
                   ; characters.

   The random string supplied by the server MUST be repeated by the
   client as the value of the VHLO parameter to the MAIL command, for
   each transaction in the framework of this VHLO command.  This is
   meant to guard against blind attacks and to ease Greylisting checks.

4.3.2.  Transient error responses

   If the the server is temporarily unable to carry out any required
   check on the Domain, it SHOULD return the 451 reply code.  Then, the
   client SHOULD quit the session and retry at a later time.

   The server MAY return the 450 reply code to indicate that it is not
   able or willing to reckon the client's reputation during this
   section, irrespectively of any parameter supplied.  In this case, the
   client MAY try an EHLO command instead, to transmit messages outside
   of any VHLO framework.

   The server MAY return the 455 reply code to indicate that it is
   temporarily unable to carry out the checks implied by one or more
   specific parameters.  It is possible that a positive response is
   given if the client repeats the command using different auth-rept-
   claim's or different tag-spec-param's.  The text of the response
   SHOULD indicate the missing parameters as described in Section 4.3.4.

4.3.3.  Negative responses

   If the the server cannot grant prime delivery because of a missing
   parameter or parameter's value in the VHLO command, it SHOULD return
   the 555 or 550 reply codes indicating the missing parameters and
   arguments as described in Section 4.3.4.

   The server MAY return the 553 reply code to indicate that it will
   never grant prime delivery for the given Domain to the current
   client, whatever auth-rept-claim's the client may supply.

   The server MUST return the 503 reply code (bad sequence of commands)
   if a VHLO command is issued while a transaction is active.

   The server MAY also return the 500 or 502 reply codes to indicate
   that it does not support this extension.

   After a 555 reply code, the client MAY retry a VHLO command with the
   parameters modified accordingly.  Otherwise, if it is unable to
   satisfy the server requirements, the client SHOULD proceed as if it

   obtained a 500 reply code.  It is RECOMMENDED that the client
   application logs the missing requirements, so that administrators
   know how to gain access to the given server.

   After reply codes 500, 502, 550, and 553, the client MUST NOT attempt
   more VHLO commands during the current session.  In addition, after
   reply codes 550 and 553, the client SHOULD NOT attempt further VHLO
   commands to this server until human intervention updates its
   configuration.

   After reply codes 500, 502, 550, 553, and 555, the client MAY quit
   the session and send the message through an alternative relay as
   described in Section 6.  Alternatively, the client MAY try an EHLO
   command instead, to transmit messages outside of any VHLO framework.

4.3.4.  Diagnosis of failed VHLO commands

   Normally, a client supplies all the claims that can possibly result
   in increased reputation, except for line length limitations.  VBR's
   certifier-list's, for example, might grow quite long and clients may
   be unable to store them on a single line.  However, servers can issue
   multi-line responses containing the complete list, so that a client
   can select the correct certifiers to include in the next attempt.  As
   some failures can be worked around automatically, failure responses
   SHALL contain both human readable text and machine readable text.
   Formally:


   Failure-resp    = *( Failure-code "-" [ diag-text ] CRLF )
                   Failure-code [ SP diag-text ] CRLF

   Failure-code    = %x34-35 %x30-35 %x30-39

   diag-text       = [ hread-text ] [ "+" mread-text ]

   hread-text      = *( %d09 / %d32-57 / %d59-126 )
                   ; regular characters except ":"

   mread-text      = auth-rept-claim / check-failed

   check-failed    = check-keyword ":" check-spec-info

   check-keyword   = "DNSBL" / "SPF"

   check-spec-info = hread-text

   A server SHOULD NOT vary its requirements during a given session.

   If a client manages to issue a successful VHLO command for a given
   Domain after a previous attempt failed, it MAY store the parameters
   for future reuse.  However, the server requirements MAY be changed in
   future sessions.

4.4.  Restrictions and further server side checks

   Messages transmitted in the framework of a successful VHLO command
   are subject to the restrictions detailed in this section.  Clients
   MUST NOT attempt to break these restrictions.  Servers SHOULD check
   that clients comply.

4.4.1.  MAIL FROM restriction

   Non-empty arguments of the MAIL FROM commands are restricted to
   addresses whose domain part is compatible with the Domain given in
   the relevant VHLO command.  Compatible here means that either the two
   domains names are identical, or they share at least one primary mail
   exchanger.

   Formally, the two domain names match a caseless comparison; or one
   [or both] of them is a CNAME label of a DNS RR whose value eventually
   refers to the other [or, respectively, a common canonical name]; or
   the two domain names, after resolving any CNAME aliasing, both have
   MX RRs and the respective lists of primary (lowest preference) hosts
   have a common element, i.e. two host names that match a caseless
   comparison.  Note that no IP address comparison is involved.

   In addition, the server MUST check that the VHLO parameter is
   included and that the corresponding value matches the random string
   that the server generated on giving the positive response to the VHLO
   command.

4.4.2.  VBR restriction

   If the VHLO command in whose framework the message is received
   contained a VBR tag, the message MAY have a VBR-Info header.  If that
   header is present, it MUST be compatible with the given vbr-param.
   Compatible here means that it mentions at least the certifier that
   the server trusts and verified before accepting the relevant VHLO
   command.

   If a VBR-Info header is not present, the receiving server MAY add one
   based on the Domain given, the certifiers it trusts and verified, and
   its guess of the type of content.

Internet-Draft                    VHLO                         June 2009


4.4.3.  DKIM-Signature headers existence and verification

   If the VHLO command in whose framework the message is received
   contained a DKIM tag, the message MUST have a DKIM-Signature header
   compatible with the given dkim-param.  Compatible here means that the
   domain (d) of the DKIM-Signature is the same, the selector (s) is the
   same one given in the parameter, the signed header fields in the
   DKIM-Signature contain at least the ones given in the parameter, and
   the signing algorithm given in the parameter, if any, matches the one
   actually used.

   In addition, if the server verifies signatures on the fly, the
   verification fails, and such failure would prevent the message from
   having a prime delivery, the server SHOULD reject the message
   instead.

4.4.4.  Greylisting restrictions

   If transmission of a message in the framework of a VHLO command fails
   due to transient conditions (4xx reply codes), and the transmission
   was not itself a retry, the sending server SHOULD annotate the
   current VHLO parameter in the message's meta data while it queues the
   message for further retries.  We refer to this piece of data as
   original-vhlo-string.  Typically, a message's meta data includes the
   envelope and possibly the failure reason, and is used by a server to
   devise a sending strategy as described in section 4.5.4.1 of
   [RFC5321].  (Note that we are talking about transient failures in the
   transmission of a message, i.e. after MAIL, RCPT, DATA, or data
   completion by <CRLF>.<CRLF>; not the VHLO command.)

   The current VHLO parameter should be added to meta data only after
   the very first failure; in particular, not if a previous attempt to
   transmit the message has happened before, whether in the framework of
   a VHLO command or not.  This implies that use of VHLO is restricted
   to hosts who are able to discern new messages from retried attempts.

   When attempting to retransmit a queued message that has this
   original-vhlo-string in its meta data, the sending client SHOULD
   transmit such string using the GID auth-rept-tag with

   gid-param       = original-vhlo-string

   Only messages that share the same original-vhlo-string may be
   transmitted in the framework of a VHLO command that used the GID
   auth-rept-tag with that value.  This implies that the sending client
   MUST terminate the current VHLO framework in case the next message's
   original-vhlo-string differs from the gid-param used to establish it
   (where no gid-param matches an empty original-vhlo-string.)

5.  Forwarding of messages accepted under VHLO

   A message accepted in the framework of a VHLO command deserves prime
   delivery.  However, the receiving server possibly does not host the
   mailboxes of the relevant recipients directly.  For example, it may
   be a boundary or secondary exchanger, a vanity address server, or it
   may be following user-specific forwarding instructions.  For this
   specification, we just distinguish if the message is forwarded within
   the same ADMD or to an external domain.

   If the message is forwarded internally, all hosts MUST be configured
   so as to honor the promise of prime delivery that border or secondary
   exchangers grant on their behalf.  If, for whatever reason, prime
   delivery is not possible, a failure notification MUST be sent to the
   Return-Path address, if any.  Even if sending notifications is
   expected to be fairly safe at this point, it is RECOMMENDED that any
   ADMD-wide policy that can be applied on acceptance produces an on-
   line rejection rather than a delayed failure notification.

   If the message if forwarded to an external domain, the SMTP client
   MUST attempt to issue a VHLO command, unless either it can determine
   that the target host does not implement this SMTP extension, or it
   has some other arrangement with the target host that grants prime
   delivery (e.g. using [ff]).  Note that, if VHLO is used for
   forwarding, unless the ADMD is an authorized sender for the original
   Domain, the Return-Path MUST be changed to that of a Domain delegated
   to the ADMD that is doing the forwarding (e.g. using [srs]).


6.  Submission strategy

   Small and medium organizations may lack the global reputation that
   would ensure high deliverability to their SMTP relays.  To increase
   the deliverability of their messages, they may use an MSA from a
   larger organization.  However, privacy concerns and mail flow
   optimization would suggest to resort to external MSAs only when that
   is necessary for message deliverability.

   The VHLO command, by allowing to check deliverability in advance,
   enables clients to use smart hosts optionally.  Rather than
   configuring a fixed mail out path for certain target domains, relays
   can dynamically adjust their strategy according to the target host's
   response to the VHLO command.  The list of preferred VBR certifiers
   provided by a negative response may be used as keys to build a
   corresponding list of smart hosts that can be used as Mail Submission
   Agents, provided that the certifiers of each smart host are known.

   To implement this strategy, a relay's configuration needs a list of

   alternative MSAs, consisting in one or more entries containing a host
   name, a username/password pair, and an optional list of VBR
   certifiers of that MSA.  Other means to dynamically select an MSA,
   and how to determine the default one should also be provided for.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This extension will have to be inserted in the mail-parameters
   assignments IANA registry.  The keyword VHLO may appear

   o  as a service type (possibly),

   o  as an SMTP extension keyword, and

   o  as an SMTP extension keyword that has a parameter.

   (Apparently, there is no registry of the MAIL command parameters that
   are used by various extensions.)

   A registry is needed for tracking the auth-rept-tag / check-keyword
   that must be unique in the diagnostic text.  This document defines

      DKIM

      DNSBL

      GID

      MX

      PTR

      SPF

      VBR


8.  Security Considerations

   This document proposes an intermediate level of trust.  An SMTP
   client is being authenticated based on weak evidence, originating
   from the DNS and the TCP layer:

   o  The IP address of the remote client is known from the TCP layer.
      Verification of the random string implies it is fairly difficult
      to forge it.

Internet-Draft                    VHLO                         June 2009


   o  Any of the MX, PTR, or SPF checks confirms that the IP address is
      somehow authorized by the domain's ADMD.

   o  The DNSBL check implies that the IP address is not that of a known
      attacker.

   The two remaining checks, DKIM and VBR, may provide two additional
   characterizations of the messages being transmitted.  DKIM ensures
   that messages have passed through the domain's signing process, which
   presumably implies that any sender's local policy has been enforced.
   In this respect, DKIM is most useful if the sending ADMD does not
   have a fine grained control on their PTR, MX, or SPF settings.

   VBR, depending on the certifier's policy, may generically ensure that
   the sending domain is well behaved.  A vouching service may
   scrutinize the DNS settings of a given domain, check their spam rate
   using honeypots, investigate the domain's users, or otherwise
   establish the domain reputation.  The possibility to communicate the
   preferred vouching services may work as an incentive for the
   advertised service providers.

   The authentication provided by this extension is weaker than SMTP
   Authentication [RFC4409].  Therefore, it SHOULD NOT be used instead
   of it.

   Diagnostic messages provided with negative responses to the VHLO
   command may disclose acceptance policies of the target domain.  This
   is not considered harmful, since such policies are usually public.
   However, in case the security structure depends on keeping that
   information secret, the server should carefully consider what
   diagnostic messages it provides to what clients.  It is possible to
   provide VHLO services to selected domains only, and discarding the
   rest with the reply code 553.
