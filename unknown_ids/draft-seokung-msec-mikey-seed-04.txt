Internet-Draft               MIKEY-SEED             September 29, 2009 
    

1. Introduction 

   This document updates IANA registries to support the SEED [RFC4269] 
   block cipher algorithm for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol 
   (SRTP) and the Secure Real-time Transport Control Protocol (SRTCP) 
   [RFC3711] in Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) [RFC3830]. 

1.1. SEED 

   SEED is a 128-bit symmetric key block cipher that has been developed 
   by KISA (Korea Information Security Agency) and a group of experts 
   since 1998. The input/output block size of SEED is 128-bit and the 
   key length is also 128-bit. SEED has a 16-round Feistel structure.  

   SEED is a Korean National Industrial Association standard and is 
   widely used in South Korea for electronic commerce and various 
   security products such as firewall, VPN, and so on. 

2. Additions to [RFC3830] payload 

   This section specifies the new values to use the SEED cipher 
   algorithm for SRTP and SRTCP. We define three modes of running SEED, 
   SEED in Counter Mode (SEED-CTR), SEED in Counter with CBC-MAC Mode 
   (SEED-CCM) and SEED in Galois/Counter Mode (SEED-GCM) Mode. These are 
   defined in [I-D.ietf-avt-seed-srtp]. 

2.1. Modified Table 6.10.1.b from [RFC3830] 

   Modified Table 6.10.1.b from [RFC3830] : 

   SRTP encr alg | Value 
   --------------------- 
   NULL          |     0 
   AES-CM        |     1 
   AES-F8        |     2 
   SEED-CTR      |     3 (NEW)  
   SEED-CCM      |     4 (NEW)  
   SEED-GCM      |     5 (NEW)

2.2. Modified Table 6.10.1.d from [RFC3830] 

   Modified Table 6.10.1.d from [RFC3830] : 

   SRTP PRF      | Value 
   --------------------- 
   AES-CM        |     0 
   SEED-CTR      |     1 (NEW) 

   Figure 2: Table 6.10.1.d from [RFC3830] (Revised) 

3. Security Considerations 

   No security problem has been found on SEED. SEED is secure against 
   all known attacks including Differential cryptanalysis, linear 
   cryptanalysis, and related key attacks. The only known attack is an 
   exhaustive search for the key. For further security considerations, 
   the reader is encouraged to read [SEED-EVAL]. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   In order to align Figure 1 with Table 6.10.1.b in [RFC3830] and 
   Figure 2 with Table 6.10.1.d in [RFC3830], IANA is requested to add 
   the values described in Section 2 to their [RFC3830] Payload Name 
   Space.
