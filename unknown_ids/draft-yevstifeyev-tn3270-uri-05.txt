INTERNET DRAFT           The tn3270 URI scheme         November 28, 2010


1.  Introduction

   The tn3270 URI scheme was first mentioned in RFC 1738. Following
   the creation of the URI scheme registries per RFC 4395 [RFC4395],
   it was added to the "Provisional" registry. However there are no
   clear and acceptable specifications so far for this scheme. 

   The generic syntax of URIs is described in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]. URI
   registering procedures are defined in RFC 4395 [RFC4395].

   This document gives a specification of syntax, semantics and use of
   tn3270 URI scheme.

2.  Scheme Definition 

   The tn3270 URI scheme is used to access services that are provided
   via TN3270 Telnet Service - Interactive 3270 emulation session (see
   RFC 2355 [RFC2355] and RFC 1041 [RFC1041] for details). TN3270
   service practices are defined in RFC 1576 [RFC1576]. In fact this is
   Telnet service with special data transfer mode so the form of URI is
   similar to that of telnet one.

   The tn3270 URI takes the following form (given in ABNF, as described
   in RFC 5234 [RFC5234]):

   tn3270_uri = "tn3270:" "//" [user ":" password] host [":" port] [/]
         user = <user name for authorization>
     password = <password for authorization>
         host = <the host name that the request is being made to>
         port = 1*5DIGIT

   The final character "/" can be omitted. The "user:password" pair can
   be omitted as well as "port" (if it is omitted, defaults to 23 -
   default Telnet port).

3.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the usage of URIs are discussed in
   Section 7 of [RFC3986].

   Many security consideration for telnet URI scheme defined in RFC 4248
   [RFC4248] concern tn3270 one as well. 

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to update the registration of tn3270 URI scheme using
   the following registration template:

   URI scheme name: tn3270

   Status: Provisional

   URI scheme syntax: see Section 2

   URI scheme semantics: see Section 2

   URI scheme encoding considerations: tn3270 scheme uses UTF-8 (see RFC
   3629 [RFC3629] for details) for encoding data. No internalization is
   intended

   Protocols that use the scheme: Telnet TN3270 mode (see RFC 2355
   [RFC2355] and RFC 1041 [RFC1041] for details)

   Security considerations: see Section 3
