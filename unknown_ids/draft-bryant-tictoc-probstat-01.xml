    <abstract>
      <t>This Internet draft describes a number of applications that require
      accurate time and/or frequency, and elucidates difficulties related to
      the transfer of high quality time and frequency across an IP or MPLS
      Packet Switched Network. This issue is not addressed by any currently
      chartered IETF working group, and we therefore propose the formation of
      a new working group to be called Transmitting Timing over IP Connections
      and Transfer of Clock (TICTOC).</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>There is an emerging need to distribute highly accurate time and
      frequency information over IP and over MPLS packet switched networks
      (PSNs). In this problem statement we give several examples of
      applications that require time and/or frequency information, and explain
      why their needs can not be satisfied by time/frequency transfer over
      PSNs using existing protocols. We review these existing protocols and
      the work being carried out in the IETF and in other forums. Finally, we
      list the objectives of a proposed Working Group.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Applications">
      <section title="Time Service Applications">
        <t>There are many applications that need to know the time with greater
        precision than provided by available mechanisms, such as the current
        version of NTP <xref target="RFC1305"></xref>. These applications span
        a range of industries: telecommunications, financial, test and
        measurement, government, industrial etc. Preliminary studies indicate
        that the availability of high accuracy time as a commodity enables use
        of techniques that were previously considered impossible. We can,
        therefore, expect that the provision of high quality time through the
        network infrastructure will generate a spiral of new innovative
        applications that will in turn make greater demands on the quality of
        time delivered to the end-user.</t>

        <t>The best-known example of an application that requires high quality
        time in the telecommunications sector is the need to measure one-way
        packet delay. Current implementations of NTP have accuracy of the
        order of 10 milliseconds. When NTP is used to characterize packet
        delay and packet delay variation, such a time-base cannot resolve any
        two party event with a resolution of better than 20 milliseconds.
        Contrast this with the characteristics of a 10 Gb/s link, 1 kilometer
        long. On such a link, a minimum sized packet takes 50 nanoseconds to
        send, and it takes 6 microseconds to traverse the link. The
        performance of current NTP implementations is orders of magnitude
        worse than the duration of network forwarding events, and clearly
        insufficient to characterize them.</t>

        <t>Although the measurement of the characteristics of a packet network
        is the best-known telecommunications example, there are other
        operational needs, notably synchronization at the MAC layer. The cable
        industry has recently defined a new intra-PoP time transmission
        mechanism for just this purpose (DOCSYS Timing Interface), and WiMAX
        is looking for relative time delivery to its transmitter sites.</t>

        <t>In the test and measurement and industrial sector there is a desire
        to move from special purpose communications infrastructure with
        calibrated wiring run back to a centralize controller, to a
        distributed system, in which instructions are distributed in advance
        to be executed at a predetermined time, and in which measurements are
        taken remotely and communicated back to a common point for later
        correlation and analysis. Two examples of this tendency are described
        below.</t>

        <t>In the printing industry there is a need to control operations in
        multi-stand printing machines. The paper travels through these
        machines at a speed of nearly 100 km/h. At these speeds, co-ordination
        error of 1 microsecond between operations taking place at different
        positions in the machine produces a 0.03mm color offset, which is
        visible to the naked eye and results in an unacceptable degradation in
        quality.</t>

        <t>In the electrical power industry there is a need to improve the
        measurement of power flows in order to monitor and predict usage
        patterns. One proposal is to extensively deploy synchro-phasors in the
        power network and to correlate their output to determine demand. These
        devices need to be able to determine the time of measurement with an
        accuracy of 1 microsecond.</t>

        <t>More generally, there is growing interest in clock synchronization
        in massively parallel sensor networks. Advances in wireless
        communications have enabled the development of low power miniature
        sensors that collect and disseminate data from their immediate
        environment. Although each sensor has limited processing power,
        through distributed processing the network becomes capable of
        performing various tasks of data fusion, but only assuming a common
        time base can be established.</t>

        <t>The examples cited above are a small illustration of a trend that
        will continue to grow as designers realize that better scaling can be
        achieved with action-in-the-future, measure-and-correlate-later
        approaches to systems design.</t>

        <t>Closer to the core interests and expertise of the IETF there is an
        emerging opinion that the availability of time as a commodity may
        simplify the protocols that we use in distributed systems.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Frequency Service Applications">
        <t>There are applications that require time with a greater precision
        than can easily be provided using available mechanisms. Cellular
        base-stations require a highly accurate frequency reference from which
        they derive transmission frequencies and operational timing.
        Conventionally GSM and WCDMA base stations obtain this reference
        frequency by locking on to the E1/T1 that links them to the base
        station controller. With the replacement of TDM links with Packet
        Switched Networks (PSNs) such as Ethernet, IP or MPLS, this simple
        method of providing a frequency reference is lost, and frequency
        information must be made available in some other way.</t>

        <t>Why must the frequency reference be so accurate? First and foremost
        the requirement is derived from the need for the radio frequencies to
        be accurate. Radio spectrum is a limited and valuable commodity that
        needs to be used as efficiently as possible. In GSM, transmission
        frequencies are allocated to a given cellular base station and its
        neighbors in such fashion as to ensure that they do not interfere with
        each other. If the radio network designer cannot rely on the accuracy
        of these frequencies, the spacing between the frequencies used by
        neighboring sites must be increased, with significant economic
        consequences.</t>

        <t>There is an additional requirement derived from the need for smooth
        handover when a mobile station crosses from one cell to another. If
        the radio system designer can not guarantee that the preparations
        required for handover occur in a few milliseconds, then they must
        allow the mobile station to consume frequency resources simultaneously
        in both cells in order to avoid service disruption. The preparations
        required involve agreement between the mobile and base stations on the
        new frequencies and time offsets; these agreements can be accomplished
        quickly when the two base stations' frequency references are the same
        to a high degree of accuracy.</t>

        <t>Another application requiring highly accurate frequency
        distribution is TDM pseudowires. The PWE3 WG has produced three
        techniques for emulating traditional low-rate (E1, T1, E3, T3) TDM
        services over PSNs, namely SAToP <xref target="RFC4553"></xref>,
        CESoPSN, and TDMoIP. The major technical barrier to universal
        acceptance of TDM pseudowires is the accuracy of its clock
        recovery.</t>

        <t>TDM network standards for timing accuracy and stability are
        extremely demanding. These requirements are not capriciously dictated
        by standards bodies, rather they are critical to the proper
        functioning of a high-speed TDM network. Consider a TDM receiver
        utilizing its own clock when converting the physical signal back into
        a bit-stream. If the receive clock runs at precisely the same rate as
        the source clock, then the receiver need only determine the optimal
        sampling phase. However, with any mismatch of clock rates, no matter
        how small, bit slips will eventually occur. For example, if the
        receive clock is slower than the source clock by one part per million
        (ppm), then the receiver will output 999,999 bits for every 1,000,000
        bits sent, thus deleting one bit. Similarly, if the receive clock is
        faster than the source clock by one part per billion (ppb), the
        receiver will insert a spurious bit every billion bits. One bit slip
        every million bits may seem acceptable at first glance, but translates
        to a catastrophic two errors per second for a 2 Mb/s E1 signal. ITU-T
        recommendations permit a few bit slips per day for a low-rate 64 kb/s
        channel, but strive to prohibit bit slips entirely for higher-rate TDM
        signals.</t>

        <t>In certain cases, such as "toll-bypass" or "carrier's carrier"
        links, the endpoints of the TDM PW are full TDM networks, and timing
        may (indeed must) be derived from the respective network clocks. Since
        each of these clocks is highly accurate, they necessarily agree to
        high order. However, TDM PWs are expected to increasingly replace
        native TDM links delivering services from core networks towards users,
        and here there is no alternative to provision of accurate frequency
        information.</t>

        <t>In this context there are two types of frequency distribution being
        studied. In the first type the frequency reference used by the TDM
        source is distributed downstream, as in the native TDM service. In the
        "common clock" scenario highly accurate frequency information is
        distributed from a central server to both ends of the emulated TDM
        link. By placing in the protocol overhead timestamps based on the
        common clock, the receiver can accurately recover the TDM source
        clock.</t>

        <t>While it is true that services designed for PSN (e.g. VoIP)
        transport are less dependent on frequency accuracy, there are still
        cases where such services need accurate frequency distribution. For
        example, when interconnecting tradition telephones via VoIP links,
        users expect these links to support legacy services, such as facsimile
        and dial-up data modems. The optimal technique for supporting these
        services is by provision of relay functions, e.g. T.38 fax-relay and
        V.150 modem-relay, that terminate the analog transmissions on both
        sides and transfer data content over the PSN. However, provision of
        relay services is computationally expensive, often requires expensive
        DSP-capable media gateways, and can only support known modem types. In
        many deployments old fax machines or proprietary data modems or secure
        voice telephones are used, and the modulations and handshake protocols
        are not recognized by the relays provided. In such cases the solution
        is to carry these transmissions over "clear channel" or Voice Band
        Data (VBD), i.e. to send raw samples of the audio in packets over the
        PSN.</t>

        <t>The problem with clear channel transfer of data over PSNs is that
        the end points expect a non-intrusive analog channel between them,
        over which they implicitly transfer timing information. The receiver
        can thus continually lock onto the transmitter's frequency, and the
        transmission can continue for an unlimited period without
        interruption. When employing clear channel, the frequency signal seen
        by the receiver is influenced by the destination gateway's clock used
        to convert the data samples back to analog form. If the source and
        destination gateways' clocks do not agree to a high degree of
        accuracy, the receiver does not properly lock onto the transmitter's
        clock, leading to disruption of the data reception. In typical cases a
        modem conversation transferred over clear channel may drop after only
        several minutes, and fax reception may be interrupted after several
        pages have been received.</t>

    <section title="Existing Time and Frequency Transfer Mechanisms">
      <t>In this section we will discuss existing mechanisms for transfer of
      time information, frequency information, or both. It should be noted
      that a sufficiently accurate time transfer service may be used to derive
      an accurate frequency transfer. Indeed, this is exactly what happens in
      a GPS disciplined frequency standard. On the other hand, an accurate
      frequency transfer service, while itself unable to transfer absolute
      time, is usually used to support and improve the performance of the time
      transfer service. Indeed, implementations of NTP or IEEE 1588 clients
      can be considered to consist of two phases. First, a local oscillator is
      locked to the server's frequency using incoming information from the
      incoming packets, and then the local time set based on the server's time
      and the propagation latency. By maintaining a local frequency source,
      the client requires relatively infrequent updates, and can continue
      functioning during short periods of network outage. Moreover, it can be
      shown that this method results in significantly better time transfer
      accuracy than methods that do not discipline a local clock.</t>

      <t>Time transfer mechanisms can be divided into three classes. The first
      class consists of mechanisms that use radio frequency transport, while
      the second mechanism uses dedicated "wires" (which for our purposes
      include optical fibers). The third, which will be our main focus,
      exploits a Packet Switched Network for transfer of timing information.
      Advantages and disadvantages of these three methods are discussed in the
      following subsections.</t>

      <section title="Radio-based Timing Transfer Methods">
        <t>The transfer of time by radio transmission is one of the oldest
        methods available, and is still the most accurate wide area method. In
        particular, there are two navigation in wide use that can be used for
        time transfer, The LOng RAnge Navigation (LORAN) terrestrial radio
        system, and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). In both
        cases the user needs to be able to receive the transmitted signal,
        requiring access to a suitable antenna. In certain situations, e.g.
        basement communications rooms and urban canyons, the required signal
        may not be receivable.</t>

        <t>Radio systems have high accuracy, far better than what we will
        later see can be achieved by existing PSN technologies. However
        coverage is limited; eLORAN for example only covers North America, and
        GPS does not have good coverage near the poles.</t>

        <t>Although civilian use is sanctioned, the GPS was developed and is
        operated by the U.S. Department of Defense as a military system. For
        this reason there are political concerns that rules out its use in
        certain countries. The European Union is working on an alternative
        system called Galileo, which will be run as a commercial enterprise.
        In addition, GPS has some well-documented multi-hour outages, and is
        considered vulnerable to jamming. One major PTT also reports that they
        see a 2% per year failure rate for the antenna/receiver/clock-out
        chain.</t>

        <t>While a radio-based timing service may be acceptable for some
        sites, it is frequently impractical to use on a per equipment basis.
        Hence, some form of local timing distribution is usually also
        required.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Dedicated Wire-based Timing Transfer Methods">
        <t>The use of dedicated networks in the wide area does not scale well.
        Such services were available in the past, but for reasons of cost and
        accuracy have been superseded by GPS based solutions.</t>

        <t>In the local area, one new technique is emerging as a mechanism for
        time transport, namely DOCSIS Timing Interface / Telecommunications
        Timing Interface (DTI/TTI). DTI was designed by DOCSIS for the
        distribution of time in a cable head-end in support of media access
        control. Time transfer is packet-based over a multi-stage hub and
        spoke dedicated network. It uses a single twisted-pair in half-duplex
        to eliminate inaccuracies due to the length differences between the
        pairs in a multi-pair cable. TTI is a development of DTI designed to
        provide synchronization in a telephone local office. Accuracy for DTI
        is better than 5 nanoseconds and range is 100 feet for DTI. This
        increases to 600 feet for TTI at some reduction in packet rate and
        hence time quality.</t>

        <t>The DTI/TTI approach is applicable for special applications, but
        the need for a dedicated network imposes significant drawbacks for the
        general time transfer case.</t>

        <t>Synchronous Ethernet is a technique that has recently been proposed
        for providing frequency distribution over Ethernet links. Modern
        dedicated-media full-duplex Ethernet, in both copper and optical
        physical layer variants, transmits continuously. One can thus elect to
        derive the physical layer transmitter clock from a high quality
        frequency reference, instead of the conventional 100 ppm
        crystal-derived transmitter rate. The receiver at the other end of the
        link automatically locks onto the physical layer clock of the received
        signal, and thus itself gain access to a highly accurate and stable
        frequency reference. Then, in TDM fashion, this receiver could lock
        the transmission clock of its other ports to this frequency
        reference.</t>

        <t>The ITU-T is presently working on a specification for synchronous
        Ethernet. Apart from some necessary higher layer packet based
        configuration and OAM operations, the solution is entirely physical
        layer, and has no impact on higher layers.</t>

        <t>At first sight it would seem that the only application of
        synchronous Ethernet was in frequency transfer (it has no intrinsic
        time transfer mechanism). However, the quality of packet-based time
        transfer mechanism can be considerably enhanced if used in conjunction
        with synchronous Ethernet as a frequency reference.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Transfer Using Packet Networks">
        <t>When using a PSN to transfer timing, a server sends timing
        information in the form of packets to one or multiple clients. When
        there are multiple clients, the timing packets may be multicast.
        Software in the client recovers the frequency and/or time of the
        server based on the packet arrival time and the packet contents.</t>

        <t>There are two well-known protocols capable of running over a
        general-purpose packet network, NTP <xref target="RFC1305"></xref>,
        and IEEE 1588 <xref target="1588"></xref>. NTP is the product of the
        IETF, and is currently undergoing revision to version 4. IEEE 1588 (a
        product of the IEEE Test and Measurement community) is specified in a
        limited first version, and the second version (1588v2)is in the
        detailed design stage.</t>

        <t>NTP is widely deployed, but existing implementations deliver
        accuracy on the order of 10 milliseconds. This accuracy is not
        adequate for the applications described above. NTP suffers from the
        fact that it was designed to operate over the Internet, and the
        routers and switches used in the best effort Internet make no special
        concessions to NTP for preservation of time transfer accuracy.
        Furthermore, typical update rates are low and can not be significantly
        increased due to scalability issues in the server. In addition most
        NTP time servers and time receivers have a relatively unsophisticated
        implementation that further degrades the final time quality.</t>

        <t>IEEE 1588v1 was a time transfer protocol that exclusively used a
        fairly crude multicast technique. It is widely anticipated that wide
        scale deployment of IEEE1588 will be based on 1588v2. The information
        exchange component of IEEE 1588 is a protocol known as Precision Time
        Protocol (PTP).</t>

        <t>IEEE 1588v2 can be considered to consist of several components:
        <list style="numbers">
            <t>A configuration and control protocol</t>

            <t>A time transfer protocol</t>

            <t>A time correction protocol</t>

            <t>Physical mapping</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The configuration and control protocol is based on the multicast
        approach of IEEE 1588v1 (multicast IP with recommended TTL=1, UDP,
        IEEE1588 payload with equipment identifier in the payload). The
        rationale for this approach was that the equipment needed to be "plug
        and play" (no configuration), was required to map to physical media
        other than Ethernet, and had to have a very low memory and processor
        footprint.</t>

        <t>The time transfer protocol is a standard two-way time transfer
        approach used in other packet-based approaches. Like all such
        approaches it is subject to inaccuracies due to variable store and
        forward delays in the packet switches, and due to the assumption of
        symmetric propagation delays. The time transfer packets (in both
        directions) may be operated in a multicast or unicast mode.</t>

        <t>The time correction protocol is used to correct for propagation,
        store and forward delays in the packet switches. This again may be
        operated multicast or unicast. This mechanism requires some level of
        hop-by-hop hardware support. This mechanism may also be considered a
        concept in its own right and may be adapted to enhance other packet
        time transfer protocols such as NTP.</t>

        <t>The base 1588 specification describes how the PTP operates over the
        Ethernet/IP/UDP protocol stack. Annexes are planned that describe PTP
        operation over pure layer 2 Ethernet, over IP without UDP, over MPLS,
        and over a number of specialist media.</t>

        <t>The mappings of interest for telecommunications are PTP over
        UDP/IP, PTP over MPLS , and perhaps PTP over Ethernet, all in unicast
        mode only. Issues of a suitable control management and OAM environment
        for these applications are largely in abeyance, as are considerations
        about the exact nature of the network environment.</t>

        <t>It is also worth noting the existence of a second IEEE effort, IEEE
        802.1AS. This group is specifying the protocol and procedures to
        ensure synchronization across Bridged and Virtual Bridged Local Area
        Networks for time sensitive applications such as audio and video. For
        these LAN media the transmission delays are assumed to be fixed and
        symmetrical. IEEE 802.1AS specifies the use of IEEE 1588
        specifications where applicable in the context of IEEE Standards
        802.1D and 802.1Q. Synchronization to an externally provided timing
        signal (e.g., a recognized timing standard such as UTC or TAI) is not
        part of this standard but is not precluded. IEEE 802.1AS will specify
        how stations attached to bridged LANs to meet the respective jitter,
        wander, and time synchronization requirements for time-sensitive
        applications.</t>

        <section title="The Packet Network Environment">
          <t>Packet delay variation, propagation asymmetry, and maximum
          permissible packet rate all have a significant bearing on the
          accuracy with which the client is able to determine absolute time.
          Thus the network environment has a large bearing on the quality of
          time that can be delivered.</t>

          <t>Packet delay variation can to some extent be addressed by traffic
          engineering, thus time transfer with a service provider network in
          which suitable traffic engineering techniques had been applied might
          reasonably be expected to deliver a higher quality time service than
          can be achieved between two arbitrary hosts connected to the
          Internet. Greater gains can probably be obtained by deploying
          equipment that incorporates IEEE 1588 style on-the-fly packet
          timestamp correction, or follow-up message mechanisms that report
          the packet storage and forward delays to the client. However one can
          only be sure that such techniques are available along the entire
          path in a well-controlled environment.</t>

          <t>The packet rate between the time-server and its client also has a
          bearing on the quality of the time transfer, because at a higher
          rate the smart filter has a better chance of extracting the "good"
          packets. In a controlled environment it is possible to ensure that
          there is adequate bandwidth, and that the server is not overloaded.
          In such an environment the onus moves from protecting the server
          from overload, to ensuring that the server can satisfy the needs of
          all of the clients.</t>

    <section title="Problems with Existing Solutions">
      <t>An obvious candidate for clock distribution is NTP or some upgrade
      thereof. While the time resolution provided by NTP is extremely good,
      the accuracy attainable by existing NTP implementations does not satisfy
      the needs of the most demanding of the applications, mainly due to
      update rate and the particular client/server method employed.</t>

      <t>The new IEEE 1588v2 protocol also addresses these needs, but has been
      largely designed around a well-controlled LAN environment. A 1588 server
      in unicast mode needs to save state information for each client, a
      solution that does not scale well to deployment sizes envisioned. In
      addition, 1588 specifies hardware upgrades in order to perform well in
      an IP network.</t>

      <t>Synchronous Ethernet only satisfies the need for frequency
      distribution, and even then only over one physical Ethernet link at a
      time. In order to use synchronous Ethernet in a network, all network
      elements must be upgraded to support synchronous operation at the
      physical layer. Even when hardware can be upgraded, only frequency is
      delivered, and there is still a need to develop a time transfer
      protocol.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Other Forums Working in this Problem Space">
      <t>The NTP WG is the IETF group working on time distribution, but is
      presently only documenting NTPv4 and is not working on new algorithms or
      protocols. It is expected that many participants of the NTP WG will
      participate in the TICTOC effort.</t>

      <t>The PWE3 WG has discussed frequency distribution for the TDM PW
      application, however it is not chartered to develop protocols for this
      purpose. It is expected that participants of the PWE3 WG who were active
      in the TDM PW discussions will participate in the TICTOC effort.</t>

      <t>The work that is underway outside the IETF is either complementary to
      this proposal, or less general than the proposal proposed by the TICTOC
      work proposal.</t>

      <t>The IEEE 1588 task force is working on a new version of their
      protocol that will run over more types of PSNs, and is planning to
      conclude its development work in the near future. The protocol to be
      specified contains elements that will be of use in an IETF environment,
      but is unlikely to be regarded as being a complete, robust solution in
      such an environment. If the IEEE 1588 structure is deemed to be a
      suitable platform, then the IETF could contribute an Internet profile,
      including a complete distributed systems environment suitable for our
      purposes. Alternatively, the IETF could perhaps borrow some of the delay
      correction mechanisms and incorporate them into a development of a new
      version of NTP.</t>

      <t>In addition, IEEE 802.1AS is working on Timing and Synchronization
      for Time-Sensitive Applications in Bridged Local Area Networks, basing
      itself on the IEEE 1588 standard.</t>

      <t>ITU-T SG15 Question 13 has produced Recommendation G.8261 "Timing and
      synchronization aspects in packet networks" <xref
      target="G8261"></xref>. This Recommendation defines requirements for
      various scenarios, outlines the functionality of frequency distribution
      elements, and provides measurement guidelines. It does not specify
      algorithms to be used for attaining the performance needed. It does
      define requirements for status synchronization messages, but does not
      otherwise define a protocol (although work is in progress). To date the
      ITU-T has focused on Ethernet infrastructure, but this is likely to
      extend to an MPLS environment. Two new work items, G.paclock and
      G.pacmod extend the work, and in particular, G.pacmod intends to
      introduce time transfer. This is an area where the IETF, with its
      expertise in IP and MPLS networks, may co-operate with the ITU.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Time and frequency services are a significant element of network
      infrastructure, and are critical for certain emerging applications.
      Hence time and frequency transfer services MUST be protected from being
      compromised. The most significant threat is a false time or frequency
      server being accepted instead of a true one, thus enabling a hacker to
      bring down critical services.</t>

      <t>Any protection mechanism must be designed in such a way that it does
      not degrade the quality of the time transfer. Such a mechanism SHOULD
      also be relatively lightweight, as client restrictions often dictate a
      low processing and memory footprint, and because the server may have
      extensive fan-out.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Timing distribution is highly sensitive to packet delay, and can thus
      can deteriorate under congestion conditions. Furthermore the
      disciplining of the client's oscillator (the sole component of frequency
      transfer, and a critical component of time transfer) is a function that
      should not be disrupted. When the service is disrupted the client needs
      to go into "holdover" mode, and its accuracy will consequently be
      degraded. Depending on the relative quality of the client's clock and
      the required quality after disciplining, a relatively high packet rate
      may be required.</t>

      <t>Timing tranfer packets should always be sent using the highest class
      of service, and when possible should be sent over a traffic engineered
      path.</t>

      <t>When the network goes into congestion it should try to avoid
      discarding time transfer packets until the situation is critical. Work
      performed by the IETF PWE3 WG on congestion would seem to be applicable
      to this problem area.</t>
