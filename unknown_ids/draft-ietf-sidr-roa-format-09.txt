Abstract

   This document defines a standard profile for Route Origin
   Authorizations (ROAs).  A ROA is a digitally signed object that
   provides a means of verifying that an IP address block holder has
   authorized an Autonomous System (AS) to originate routes to that one
   or more prefixes within the address block.

1. Introduction

   The primary purpose of the Internet IP Address and Autonomous System
   (AS) Number Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) system is to
   improve routing security.  As part of this system, a mechanism is
   needed to allow entities to verify that an AS has been given
   permission by an IP address block holder to advertise routes to one
   or more prefixes within that block.  A ROA provides this function.

   The ROA makes use of the template for RPKI digitally signed objects
   [SIGNOBJ], which defines a Crytopgraphic Message Syntax (CMS)
   [RFC5652] wrapper for the ROA content as well as a generic validation
   procedure for RPKI signed objects. Therefore, to complete the
   specification of the ROA (see Section 4 of [SIGNOBJ]), this document
   defines:

      1. The OID that identifies the signed object as being a ROA. (This
         OID appears within the eContentType in the encapContentInfo



Lepinski, Kent and Kong    Expires May 2011                    [Page 2]

Internet-Draft       Route Origin Authorizations          November 2010


         object as well as the ContentType signed attribute in the
         signerInfo object.)

      2. The ASN.1 syntax for the ROA eContent. (This is the payload
         that specifies the AS being authorized to originate routes as
         well as the prefixes to which the AS may originate routes.)

      3. An additional step required to validate ROAs (in addition to
         the validation steps specified in [SIGNOBJ]).

1.1. Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC5280] and "X.509
   Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers" [RFC3779].

   Additionally, this document makes use of the RPKI signed object
   profile [SIGN-OBJ] and thus familiarity with that document is also
   assumed.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", ''NOT RECOMMENDED'', "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC-2119 [RFC2119].


2. The ROA ContentType

   The ContentType for a ROA is defined as routeOriginAttestation and
   has the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.24.

   This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the
   encapContentInfo object as well as the ContentType signed attribute
   in the signerInfo object (see [SIGNOBJ]).

3. The ROA eContent

   The content of a ROA identifies a single AS that has been authorized
   by the address space holder to originate routes and a list of one or
   more IP address prefixes that will be advertised.  If the address
   space holder needs to authorize multiple ASes to advertise the same
   set of address prefixes, the holder issues multiple ROAs, one per AS
   number. A ROA is formally defined as:

      RouteOriginAttestation ::= SEQUENCE {
         version [0] INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
         asID  ASID,
         ipAddrBlocks SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF ROAIPAddressFamily }

      ASID ::= INTEGER

      ROAIPAddressFamily ::= SEQUENCE {
         addressFamily OCTET STRING (SIZE (2..3)),
         addresses SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..MAX)) OF ROAIPAddress }


      ROAIPAddress ::= SEQUENCE {
         address IPAddress,
         maxLength INTEGER OPTIONAL }

      IPAddress ::= BIT STRING

   Note that this content appears as the eContent within the
   encapContentInfo (see [SIGNOBJ]).

3.1. version

   The version number of the RouteOriginAttestation MUST be 0.

3.2. asID

   The asID field contains the AS number that is authorized to originate
   routes to the given IP address prefixes.

3.3. ipAddrBlocks

   The ipAddrBlocks field encodes the set of IP address prefixes to
   which the AS is authorized to originate routes. Note that the syntax
   here is more restrictive than that used in the IP Address Delegation
   extension defined in RFC 3779. That extension can represent arbitrary
   address ranges, whereas ROAs need to represent only prefixes.

   Within the ROAIPAddressFamily structure, addressFamily contains the
   Address Family Identifier (AFI) of an IP address family. This
   specification only supports IPv4 and IPv6. Therefore, addressFamily
   MUST be either 0001 or 0002.

   Within a ROAIPAddress structure, the addresses field represents
   prefixes as a sequence of type IPAddress. (See [RFC3779] for more
   details). If present, the maxLength MUST be an integer greater than
   or equal to the length of the accompanying prefix and less than or


Lepinski, Kent and Kong    Expires May 2011                    [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       Route Origin Authorizations          November 2010


   equal to the length (in bits) of an IP address in the address family
   (32 for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6). When present, the maxLength specifies
   the maximum length of IP address prefix that the AS is authorized to
   advertise. (For example, if the IP Address prefix is 10.0/16 and the
   maxLength is 24, the AS is authorized to advertise any more specific
   prefix having length at most 24. That is, in this example, the AS
   would be authorized to advertise 10.0/16, 10.0.128/20, or
   10.0.255/24, but not 10.0.255.0/25.) When the maxLength is not
   present, the AS is only authorized to advertise exactly the prefix
   specified in the ROA.

   Note that a valid ROA may contain an IP Address prefix (within a
   ROAIPAddress element) that is encompassed by another IP Address
   prefix (within a separate ROAIPAddress element). For example, a ROA
   may contain the prefix 10.0/16 with maxLength 18, as well as the
   prefix 10.0.0/24 with maxLength 24. (Such a ROA would authorize the
   indicated AS to advertise any prefix beginning with 10.0 with length
   at least 16 and no greater than 18, as well as the specific prefix
   10.0.0/24.) Additionally, a ROA MAY contain two ROAIPAddress elements
   where the IP Address prefix is identical in both cases. However, this
   is NOT RECOMMENDED as in such a case the ROAIPAddress with the
   shorter maxLength grants no additional privileges to the indicated AS
   and thus can be omitted without changing the meaning of the ROA.

4. ROA Validation

   Before a relying party can use a ROA to validate a routing
   announcement, the relying party MUST first validate the ROA. To
   validate a ROA the relying party MUST perform all the validation
   checks specified in [SIGNOBJ] as well as the following additional
   ROA-specific validation step.

   1. The IP Address Delegation extension [RFC3779] is present in the
      End-Entity (EE) certificate (contained within the ROA) and each IP
      address prefix(es) in ROA is contained within the set of IP
      addresses specified by the EE certificate's IP address delegation
      extension.

5. Security Considerations

   There is no assumption of confidentiality for the data in a ROA; it
   is anticipated that ROAs will be stored in repositories that are
   accessible to all ISPs, and perhaps to all Internet users. There is
   no explicit authentication associated with a ROA, since the PKI used
   for ROA validation provides authorization but not authentication.
   Although the ROA is a signed, application layer object, there is no
   intent to convey non-repudiation via a ROA.

Internet-Draft       Route Origin Authorizations          November 2010



   The purpose of a ROA is to convey authorization for an AS to
   originate a route to the prefix(es) in the ROA. Thus the integrity of
   a ROA MUST be established. The ROA specification makes use of the
   RPKI signed object format, thus all security considerations in [SIGN-
   OBJ] also apply to ROAs. Additionally, the signed object profile uses
   the CMS signed message format for integrity, and thus ROA inherit all
   security considerations associated with that data structure.

   The right of the ROA signer to authorize the target AS to originate
   routes to the prefix(es) is established through use of the address
   space and AS number PKI described in [ARCH]. Specifically one MUST
   verify the signature on the ROA using an X.509 certificate issued
   under this PKI, and check that the prefix(es) in the ROA match those
   in the address space extension in the certificate.

6. IANA Considerations

   None.
