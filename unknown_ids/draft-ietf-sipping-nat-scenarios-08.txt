Abstract

   Traversal of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the sessions
   it establishes through Network Address Translators (NAT) is a complex
   problem.  Currently there are many deployment scenarios and traversal
   mechanisms for media traffic.  This document aims to provide concrete
   recommendations and a unified method for NAT traversal as well as
   documenting corresponding flows.

Internet-Draft                NAT Scenarios                   April 2008


1.  Introduction

   NAT (Network Address Translators) traversal has long been identified
   as a complex problem when considered in the context of the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP)[RFC3261] and it's associated media such as
   Real Time Protocol (RTP)[RFC3550].  The problem is exacerbated by the
   variety of NATs that are available in the market place today and the
   large number of potential deployment scenarios.  Detail of different
   NAT behaviors can be found in 'NAT Behavioral Requirements for
   Unicast UDP' [RFC4787].

   The IETF has been active on many specifications for the traversal of
   NAT, including STUN[I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis],
   ICE[I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice], symmetric response[RFC3581], symmetric
   RTP[RFC4961], TURN[I-D.ietf-behave-turn], SIP
   Outbound[I-D.ietf-sip-outbound], SDP attribute for RTCP[RFC3605], and
   others.  These each represent a part of the solution, but none of
   them gives the overall context for how the NAT traversal problem is
   decomposed and solved through this collection of specifications.
   This document serves to meet that need.

   This document provides a definitive set of 'Best Common Practices' to
   demonstrate the traversal of SIP and its associated media through NAT
   devices.  The document does not propose any new functionality but
   does draw on existing solutions for both core SIP signaling and media
   traversal (as defined in Section 3).

   The draft is split into distinct sections as follows:
   1.  A clear definition of the problem statement.
   2.  Description of proposed solutions for both SIP protocol signaling
       and media signaling.
   3.  A set of basic and advanced flow scenarios.


2.  Problem Statement

   The traversal of SIP through NAT can be split into two categories
   that both require attention - The core SIP signaling and associated
   media traversal.

   The core SIP signaling has a number of issues when traversing through
   NATs.

   Normal SIP response routing over UDP causes the response to be
   delivered to the source IP address specified in the topmost Via
   header, or the "received" parameter of the topmost Via header.  The
   port is extracted from the SIP 'Via' header to complete the IP
   address/port combination for returning the SIP response.  While the

   destination for the response is correct, the port contained in the
   SIP 'Via' header represents the listening port of the originating
   client and not the port representing the open pin hole on the NAT.
   This results in responses being sent back to the NAT but to a port
   that is likely not open for SIP traffic.  The SIP response will then
   be dropped at the NAT.  This is illustrated in Figure 1 which depicts
   a SIP response being returned to port 5060.

   Secondly, when using a reliable, connection orientated transport
   protocol such as TCP, SIP has an inherent mechanism that results in
   SIP responses reusing the connection that was created/used for the
   corresponding transactional request.  The SIP protocol does not
   provide a mechanism that allows new requests generated in the reverse
   direction of the originating client to use, for example, the existing
   TCP connection created between the client and the server during
   registration.  This results in the registered contact address not
   being bound to the "connection" in the case of TCP.  Requests are
   then blocked at the NAT, as illustrated in Figure 2.  This problem
   also exists for unreliable transport protocols such as UDP where
   external NAT mappings need to be re-used to reach a SIP entity on the
   private side of the network.

                         Figure 2: Failed Request

   In Figure 2 the original REGISTER request is sent from the client on
   port 8023 and received on port 5060, establishing a reliable
   connection and opening a pin-hole in the NAT.  The generation of a
   new request from the proxy results in a request destined for the
   registered entity (Contact IP address) which is not reachable from
   the public network.  This results in the new SIP request attempting
   to create a connection to a private network address.  This problem
   would be solved if the original connection was re-used.  While this
   problem has been discussed in the context of connection orientated
   protocols such as TCP, the problem exists for SIP signaling using any
   transport protocol.  The impact of connection reuse of connection
   orientated transports (TCP, TLS, etc) is discussed in more detail in
   the connection reuse specification[I-D.ietf-sip-connect-reuse].  The
   approach proposed for this problem in Section 3 of this document is
   relevant for all SIP signaling, regardless of the transport protocol.

   NAT policy can dictate that connections should be closed after a
   period of inactivity.  This period of inactivity may vary from a
   number seconds to hours.  SIP signaling can not be relied upon to
   keep alive connections for the following two reasons.  Firstly, SIP
   entities can sometimes have no signaling traffic for long periods of
   time which has the potential to exceed the inactivity timer, and this
   can lead to problems where endpoints are not available to receive
   incoming requests as the connection has been closed.  Secondly, if a
   low inactivity timer is specified, SIP signaling is not appropriate
   as a keep-alive mechanism as it has the potential to add a large
   amount of traffic to the network which uses up valuable resource and
   also requires processing at a SIP stack, which is also a waste of
   processing resources.

   Media associated with SIP calls also has problems traversing NAT.

   RTP [RFC3550] is one of the most common media transport types used in
   SIP signaling.  Negotiation of RTP occurs with a SIP session
   establishment using the Session Description Protocol(SDP) [RFC2327]
   and a SIP offer/answer exchange[RFC3264].  During a SIP offer/answer
   exchange an IP address and port combination are specified by each
   client in a session as a means of receiving media such as RTP.  The
   problem arises when a client advertises its address to receive media
   and it exists in a private network that is not accessible from
   outside the NAT.  Figure 3 illustrates this problem.

                          Figure 3: Failed Media

   The connection addresses of the clients behind the NATs will
   nominally contain a private IPv4 or IPv6 address that is not routable
   across the public Internet.  Exacerbating matters even more would be
   the tendency of Client A to send media to a destination address it
   received in the signaling confirmation message -- an address that may
   actually correspond to a host within the private network who is
   suddenly faced with incoming RTP packets (likewise, Client B may send
   media to a host within its private network who did not solicit these
   packets.)  And finally, to complicate the problem even further, a
   number of different NAT topologies with different default behaviors
   increases the difficulty of arriving at a single approach.


3.  Solution Technology Outline Description

   As mentioned previously, the traversal of SIP through existing NATs
   can be divided into two discrete problem areas: getting the core
   signaling across the NAT, and enabling media as specified by SDP in a
   SIP offer/answer exchange to flow between endpoints.

3.1.  SIP Signaling

   SIP signaling has two areas that result in transactional failure when
   traversing through NAT, as described in Section 2 of this document.
   The remaining sub-sections describe appropriate solutions that result
   in SIP signaling traversal through NAT, regardless of transport
   protocol.  It is RECOMMEDED that SIP compliant entities follow the
   guidelines presented in this section to enable traversal of SIP
   signaling through NATs.

3.1.1.  Symmetric Response

   As described in Section 2 of this document, when using an unreliable
   transport protocol such as UDP, SIP responses are sent to the IP
   address and port combination contained in the SIP 'Via' header field
   (or default port for the appropriate transport protocol if not
   present).  This can result in responses being blocked at a NAT.  In
   such circumstances, SIP signaling requires a mechanism that will
   allow entities to override the basic response generation mechanism in
   RFC 3261 [RFC3261].  Once the SIP response is constructed, the
   destination is still derived using the mechanisms described in RFC
   3261 [RFC3261].  The port (to which the response will be sent),
   however, will not equal that specified in the SIP 'Via' header field
   but will be the port from which the original request was sent.  This
   results in the pin-hole opened for the requests traversal of the NAT
   being reused, in a similar manner to that of reliable connection
   orientated transport protocols such as TCP.  Figure 4 illustrates the
   response traversal through the open pin hole using this method.

   Client B would normally respond to the port available in the SIP Via
   header, as illustrated in Figure 1.  Client B honors the 'rport'
   parameter in the SIP Via header and routes the response to port from
   which it was sent.  The exact functionality for this method of
   response traversal is called 'Symmetric Response' and the details are
   documented in RFC 3581 [RFC3581].  Additional requirements are
   imposed on SIP entities in this specification such as listening and
   sending SIP requests/responses from the same port.

3.1.2.  Re-use of Connections

   The second problem with sip signaling, as defined in Section 2 and
   illustrated in Figure 2, is to allow incoming requests to be properly
   routed.

   Guidelines for devices such as User Agents that can only generate
   outbound connections through a NAT are documented in 'SIP Conventions
   for UAs with Outbound Only Connections'[I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].  The
   document provides techniques that use a unique User Agent instance
   identifier (instance-id) in association with a flow identifier
   (reg-id).  The combination of the two identifiers provides a key to a
   particular connections (both UDP and TCP) that are stored in
   association with registration bindings.  On receiving an incoming
   request to a SIP Address-Of-Record (AOR), a proxy/registrar routes to
   the associated flow created by the registration and thus a route
   through a NAT.  It also provides a keepalive mechanism for clients to
   keep NAT bindings alive.  This is achieved by multiplexing a relative
   ping/pong mechanism over the SIP signaling connection (STUN for UDP
   and CRLF/operating system keepalive for reliable transports like
   TCP).  Usage of this specification is RECOMMENDED.  This mechanism is
   not transport specific and should be used for any transport protocol.

   Even if the SIP Outbound draft is not used, clients generating SIP
   requests SHOULD use the same IP address and port (i.e., socket) for
   both transmission and receipt of SIP messages.  Doing so allows for
   the vast majority of industry provided solutions to properly
   function.  Deployments should also consider the mechanism described
   in the Connection Reuse[I-D.ietf-sip-connect-reuse] specification for
   routing bi-directional messages securely between trusted SIP Proxy
   servers.

3.2.  Media Traversal

   This document has already provided guidelines that recommend using
   extensions to the core SIP protocol to enable traversal of NATs.
   While ultimately not desirable, the additions are relatively straight
   forward and provide a simple, universal solution for varying types of
   NAT deployment.  The issues of media traversal through NATs is not

Internet-Draft                NAT Scenarios                   April 2008


   straight forward and requires the combination of a number of
   traversal methodologies.  The technologies outlined in the remainder
   of this section provide the required solution set.

3.2.1.  Symmetric RTP/RTCP

   The primary problem identified in Section 2 of this document is that
   internal IP address/port combinations can not be reached from the
   public side of a NAT.  In the case of media such as RTP, this will
   result in no audio traversing a NAT (as illustrated in Figure 3).  To
   overcome this problem, a technique called 'Symmetric' RTP/RTCP can be
   used.  This involves an SIP endpoint both sending and receiving RTP/
   RTCP traffic from the same IP Address/Port combination.  This
   technique is known as 'Symmetric RTP/RTCP' and is documented in RFC
   4961 [RFC4961].  'Symmetric RTP/RTCP' SHOULD only solely be used for
   traversal of RTP through NAT when one of the participants in a media
   session definitively knows that it is on the public network.

3.2.1.1.  RTCP

   Normal practice when selecting a port for defining Real Time Control
   Protocol(RTCP) [RFC3550] is for consecutive order numbering (i.e
   select an incremented port for RTCP from that used for RTP).  This
   assumption causes RTCP traffic to break when traversing many NATs due
   to blocked ports.  To combat this problem a specific address and port
   need to be specified in the SDP rather than relying on such
   assumptions.  RFC 3605 [RFC3605] defines an SDP attribute that is
   included to explicitly specify transport connection information for
   RTCP so a separate, explicit NAT binding can be set up for the
   purpose.  The address details can be obtained using any appropriate
   method including those detailed in this section (e.g.  STUN, TURN,
   ICE).

   An alternative mechanism defined in [I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-and-rtcp-mux]
   specifies 'muxing' both RTP and RTCP on the same IP/PORT combination.
   Using this technique eliminates the problem and is RECOMENDED.

3.2.2.  STUN

   Simple Traversal of Underneath Network Address Translators(NAT) or
   STUN is defined in RFC 3489bis [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis].  STUN is
   a lightweight tool kit and protocol that provides details of the
   external IP address/port combination used by the NAT device to
   represent the internal entity on the public facing side of a NAT.  On
   learning of such an external representation, a client can use it
   accordingly as the connection address in SDP to provide NAT
   traversal.  Using terminology defined in the draft 'NAT Behavioral
   Requirements for Unicast UDP' [RFC4787], STUN does work with



Boulton, Ed., et al.    Expires October 27, 2008                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                NAT Scenarios                   April 2008


   'Endpoint Independent Mapping' but does not work with either 'Address
   Dependent Mapping' or 'Address and Port Dependent Mapping' type NATs.
   Using STUN with either of the previous two NAT mappings to probe for
   the external IP address/port representation will provide a different
   result to that required for traversal by an alternative SIP entity.
   The IP address/port combination deduced for the STUN server would be
   blocked for incoming packets from an alterative SIP entity.

   As mentioned in Section 3.1.2, STUN is also used as a client-to-
   server keep-alive mechanism to refresh NAT bindings.

3.2.3.  TURN

   As described in the Section 3.2.2, the STUN protocol does not work
   for UDP traversal through certain identified NAT mappings.
   'Obtaining Relay Addresses from Simple Traversal of UDP Through NAT
   (known as TURN)' is a usage of the STUN protocol for deriving (from a
   STUN server) an address that will be used to relay packet towards a
   client.  TURN provides an external address (globally routable) at a
   STUN server that will act as a media relay which guarantees traffic
   will reach the associated internal address.  The full details of the
   TURN specification are defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-turn].  A TURN
   service will almost always provide media traffic to a SIP entity but
   it is RECOMMENDED that this method only be used as a last resort and
   not as a general mechanism for NAT traversal.  This is because using
   TURN has high performance costs when relaying media traffic and can
   lead to unwanted latency.

3.2.4.  ICE

   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is the RECOMMENDED
   method for traversal of existing NAT if Symmetric RTP is not
   appropriate.  ICE is a methodology for using existing technologies
   such as STUN, TURN and any other UNSAF[RFC3424] compliant protocol to
   provide a unified solution.  This is achieved by obtaining as many
   representative IP address/port combinations as possible using
   technologies such as STUN/TURN etc.  Once the addresses are
   accumulated, they are all included in the SDP exchange in a new media
   attribute called 'candidate'.  Each 'candidate' SDP attribute entry
   has detailed connection information including a media addresses,
   priority, transport.  The appropriate IP address/port combinations
   are used in the correct order depending on the specified priority.  A
   client compliant to the ICE specification will then locally run
   instances of STUN servers on all addresses being advertised using
   ICE.  Each instance will undertake connectivity checks to ensure that
   a client can successfully receive media on the advertised address.
   Only connections that pass the relevant connectivity checks are used
   for media exchange.  The full details of the ICE methodology are

   contained in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice].

   An extension to ICE is also available for TCP based media
   interactions and is documented in 'TCP Candidates with Interactive
   Connectivity Establishment (ICE)'[I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-tcp].

3.2.5.  Solution Profiles

   This draft has documented a number of technology solutions for the
   traversal of media through differing NAT deployments.  A number of
   'profiles' will now be defined that categorize varying levels of
   support for the technologies described.

3.2.5.1.  Primary Profile

   A client falling into the 'Primary' profile supports ICE in
   conjunction with STUN, TURN usage and RFC 3605 [RFC3605] and/or
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-and-rtcp-mux] for RTCP.  ICE is used in all cases
   and falls back to standard operation when dealing with non-ICE
   clients.  A client which falls into the 'Primary' profile will be
   maximally interoperable and function in a rich variety of
   environments including enterprise, consumer and behind all varieties
   of NAT.

   It is RECOMMENDED that symmetric RTP and symmetric RTCP always be
   used for bidirectional RTP media streams.

3.2.5.2.  Consumer Profile

   A client falling into the 'Consumer' profile supports STUN and RFC
   3605 [RFC3605] and/or [I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-and-rtcp-mux] for RTCP.  It
   uses STUN to allocate bindings, and can also detect when it is behind
   an Address Dependant or Address and Port Dependant NAT, although it
   simply cannot function in this case.  These clients will only work in
   deployment situations where the access is sufficiently controlled to
   know definitively that there won't be Symmetric NAT.  This is hard to
   guarantee as users can always pick up their client and connect via a
   different access network.

   It is RECOMMENDED that symmetric RTP and symmetric RTCP always be
   used for bidirectional RTP media streams.

3.2.5.3.  Minimal Profile

   A client falling into the 'Minimal' profile will send/receive RTP/
   RTCP from the same IP/port combination.  This client requires
   proprietary network based solutions to function in any NAT traversal
   scenario.

   In summary, the following table provides a representation of the
   profiles:


            | Primary  | Consumer | Minimal |
            | Profile  | Profile  | Profile |
   ---------+----------+----------+---------+

   RFC3605  |   Yes    |    Yes   |   No    |

   ---------+----------+----------+---------+


                            Figure 5: Profiles

   All clients SHOULD support the 'Primary Profile', MUST support the
   'Minimal Profile' and MAY support the 'Consumer Profile'.


4.  NAT Traversal Scenarios

   The following sub-sections concentrate on SIP signaling traversal of
   NAT.  The scenarios include traversal for both reliable and un-
   reliable transport protocols.

                                 Figure 6

   In this example the client sends a SIP REGISTER request through a NAT
   which is challenged using the Digest authentication scheme.  The
   client will include an 'rport' parameter as described in
   Section 3.1.1 of this document for allowing traversal of UDP
   responses.  The original request as illustrated in (1) in Figure 6 is
   a standard REGISTER message:

   This proxy now generates a SIP 401 response to challenge for
   authentication, as depicted in (2) from Figure 5:

    SIP/2.0 401 Unauthorized
    Via: SIP/2.0/UDP client.example.com:5060

    Call-ID: 763hdc73y7dkb37@example.com
    CSeq: 1 REGISTER
    WWW-Authenticate: [not shown]
    Content-Length: 0

   The response will be sent to the address appearing in the 'received'
   parameter of the SIP 'Via' header (address 192.0.1.2).  The response
   will not be sent to the port deduced from the SIP 'Via' header, as
   per standard SIP operation but will be sent to the value that has
   been stamped in the 'rport' parameter of the SIP 'Via' header (port
   8050).  For the response to successfully traverse the NAT, all of the
   conventions defined in RFC 3581 [RFC3581] MUST be obeyed.  Make note
   of both the 'connectionID' and 'sip.instance' contact header
   parameters.  They are used to establish an Outbound connection tuple
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].  The connection tuple creation
   is clearly shown in Figure 5.  This ensures that any inbound request
   that causes a registration lookup will result in the re-use of the
   connection path established by the registration.  This exonerates the
   need to manipulate contact header URI's to represent a globally
   routable address as perceived on the public side of a NAT.  The
   subsequent messages defined in (3) and (4) from Figure 5 use the same
   mechanics for NAT traversal.

   Traversal of SIP REGISTER requests/responses using a reliable,

   additional core SIP signaling extensions.  SIP responses will re-use
   the connection created for the initial REGISTER request, (1) from

   This example was included to show the inclusion of the connection re-
   use Contact header parameters as defined in the SIP Outbound
   specification [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].  This creates an association
   tuple as described in the previous example for future inbound
   requests directed at the newly created registration binding with the
   only difference that the association is with a TCP connection, not a
   UDP pin hole binding.

   This section demonstrates traversal mechanisms when the Registrar
   component is not co-located with the edge proxy element.  The

   Registrar.  The important message to note is (5) in Figure 7.  The
   Edge proxy, on receiving a REGISTER request that contains a
   'sip.instance' media feature tag, forms a unique flow identifier
   token as discussed in [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].  At this point, the
   proxy server routes the SIP REGISTER message to the Registrar.  The
   proxy will create the connection tuple as described in SIP Outbound
   at the same moment as the co-located example, but for subsequent
   messages to arrive at the Proxy, the element needs to request to
   remain in the SIP signaling path.  To achieve this the proxy inserts
   to REGISTER message (5) a SIP PATH extension header, as defined in
   RFC 3327 [RFC3327].  The previously created flow association token is
   inserted in a position within the Path header where it can easily be
   retrieved at a later point when receiving messages to be routed to
   the registration binding (in this case the user part of the SIP URI).
   The REGISTER message of (5), when proxied in (6) looks as follows:

 REGISTER sip:registrar.example.com SIP/2.0
 Via: SIP/2.0/TCP proxy.example.com:5060;branch=z9hG4njkca8398hadjaa
 Via: SIP/2.0/TCP client.example.com:5060;branch=z9hG4bKyilassjdshfu
 Max-Forwards: 70
 Supported: path,gruu

 Content-Length: 0


   This REGISTER request results in the Path header being stored along
   with the AOR and it's associated binding at the Registrar.  The URI
   contained in the Path header will be inserted as a pre-loaded SIP
   'Route' header into any request that arrives at the Registrar and is
   directed towards the associated AOR binding.  This guarantees that
   all requests for the new registration will be forwarded to the Edge
   Proxy.  In our example, the user part of the SIP 'Path' header URI
   that was inserted by the Edge Proxy contains the unique token
   identifying the flow to the client.  On receiving subsequent
   requests, the edge proxy will examine the user part of the pre-loaded
   SIP 'route' header and extract the unique flow token for use in its
   connection tuple comparison, as defined in the SIP Outbound
   specification [I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].  An example which builds on
   this scenario (showing an inbound request to the AOR) is detailed in
   Section 4.1.4.2 of this document.

     Figure 8.

   The initiating client generates an INVITE request that is to be sent
   through the NAT to a Proxy server.  The INVITE message is represented
   in Figure 8 by (1) and is as follows:



   INVITE sip:clientB@example.com SIP/2.0
   Via: SIP/2.0/UDP client.example.com:5060;rport;branch=z9hG4bK74husdHG
   Max-Forwards: 70

   Content-Type: application/sdp
   Content-Length: ..

   [SDP not shown]

   There are a number of points to note with this message:
   1.  Firstly, as with the registration example in Section 4.1.1.1,
       responses to this request will not automatically pass back
       through a NAT and so the SIP 'Via' header 'rport' is included as
       described in the 'Symmetric response' Section 3.1.1 and defined
       in RFC 3581 [RFC3581].
   2.  Secondly, the contact inserted contains the
       GRUU[I-D.ietf-sip-gruu] previously obtained from the SIP 200 OK
       response to the registration.  Use of the GRUU ensures that any
       SIP requests within the dialog sent in the opposite direction
       will be able to traverse the NAT.  This occurs using the



Boulton, Ed., et al.    Expires October 27, 2008               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft                NAT Scenarios                   April 2008


       mechanisms defined in the SIP Outbound
       specification[I-D.ietf-sip-outbound].  A request arriving at the
       entity which resolves to the GRUU (registrar/proxy) is then able
       to determine a previously registered connection that will allow
       the request to traverse the NAT and reach the intended endpoint.

4.1.3.2.  Reliable Transport

   When using a reliable transport such as TCP the call flow and
   procedures for traversing a NAT are almost identical to those
   described in Section 4.1.3.1.  The primary difference when using
   reliable transport protocols is that Symmetric response[RFC3581] are
   not required for SIP responses to traverse a NAT.  RFC 3261[RFC3261]
   defines procedures for SIP response messages to be sent back on the
   same connection on which the request arrived.

4.1.4.  Receiving an Invitation to a Session

   This section details scenarios where a client behind a NAT receives
   an inbound request through a NAT.  These scenarios build on the
   previous registration scenario from Section 4.1.1 and Section 4.1.2
   in this document.

4.1.4.1.  Registrar/Proxy Co-located

   The core SIP signaling associated with this call flow is not impacted
   directly by the transport protocol and so only one example scenario
   is necessary.  The example uses UDP and follows on from the
   registration installed in the example from Section 4.1.1.1.

   The INVITE request matches the registration binding previously
   installed at the Registrar and the INVITE request-URI is re-written
   to the selected onward address.  The proxy then examines the request
   URI of the INVITE and compares with its list of current open flows.
   It uses the incoming AOR to commence the check for associated open
   connections/mappings.  Once matched, the proxy checks to see if the
   unique instance identifier (+sip.instance) associated with the
   binding equals the same instance identifier associated with the flow.
   The request is then dispatched on the appropriate flow.  This is

   It is a standard SIP INVITE request with no additional functionality.
   The major difference being that this request will not follow the
   address specified in the Request-URI, as standard SIP rules would
   enforce but will be sent on the flow associated with the registration
   binding (look-up procedures in RFC 3263 [RFC3263] are overridden).
   This then allows the original connection/mapping from the initial
   registration process to be re-used.

4.1.4.2.  Registrar/Proxy Not Co-located

   The core SIP signaling associated with this call flow is not impacted
   directly by the transport protocol and so only one example scenario
   is necessary.  The example uses TCP and follows on from the
   registration installed in the example from Section 4.1.2.

   An INVITE request arrives at the Registrar with a destination

   The INVITE request matches the registration binding previously
   installed at the Registrar and the INVITE request-URI is re-written
   to the selected onward address.  The Registrar also identifies that a
   SIP PATH header was associated with the registration and pushes it
   into the INVITE request in the form of a pre-loaded SIP Route header.
   It then forwards the request on to the proxy identified in the SIP

   The request then arrives at the outbound proxy for the client.  The
   proxy examines the request URI of the INVITE in conjunction with the
   flow token that it previously inserted into the user part of the PATH
   header SIP URI (which now appears in the user part of the Route
   header in the incoming INVITE).  The proxy locates the appropriate
   flow and sends the message to the client, as shown in (3) from Figure

   It is a standard SIP INVITE request with no additional functionality
   at the originator.  The major difference being that this request will
   not follow the address specified in the Request-URI when it reaches
   the outbound proxy, as standard SIP rules would enforce but will be
   sent on the flow associated with the registration binding as
   indicated in the Route header(look-up procedures in RFC 3263

   [RFC3263] are overridden).  This then allows the original connection/
   mapping from the initial registration to the outbound proxy to be re-
   used.

4.2.  Basic NAT Media Traversal

   This section provides example scenarios to demonstrate basic media
   traversal using the techniques outlined earlier in this document.

   In the flow diagrams STUN messages have been annotated for simplicity
   as follows:
   o  The "Src" attribute represents the source transport address of the
      message.
   o  The "Dest" attribute represents the destination transport address
      of the message.
   o  The "Map" attribute represents the server reflexive (XOR-MAPPED-
      ADDRESS STUN attribute) transport address.
   o  The "Rel" attribute represents the relayed (RELAY-ADDRESS STUN
      attribute) transport address.

   The meaning of each STUN attribute is extensively explained in the
   core STUN[I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis] and TURN
   usage[I-D.ietf-behave-turn] drafts.

   A number of ICE SDP attributes have also been included in some of the
   examples.  Detailed information on individual attributes can be
   obtained from the core ICE specification[I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice].

   The examples also contain a mechanism for representing transport
   addresses.  It would be confusing to include representations of
   network addresses in the call flows and make them hard to follow.
   For this reason network addresses will be represented using the
   following annotation.  The first component will contain the
   representation of the client responsible for the address.  For
   example in the majority of the examples "L" (left client), "R" (right
   client), NAT-PUB" (NAT public), PRIV (Private), and "STUN-PUB" (STUN
   Public) are used.  To allow for multiple addresses from the same
   network element, each representation can also be followed by a
   number.  These can also be used in combination.  For example "L-NAT-
   PUB-1" would represent a public network address on the left hand side
   NAT while "R-NAT-PUB-1" would represent a public network address in
   the right hand side of the NAT.  "L-PRIV-1" would represent a private
   network address on the left hand side of the NAT while "R-PRIV-1"
   represents a private address on the right hand side of the NAT.

   It should also be noted that during the examples it might be
   appropriate to signify an explicit part of a transport address.  This
   is achieved by adding either the '.address' or '.port' tag on the end

   of the representation.  For example, 'L-PRIV-1.address' and 'L-PRIV-
   1.port'.

4.2.1.  Endpoint Independent NAT

   This section demonstrates an example of a client both initiating and
   receiving calls behind an 'Endpoint independent' NAT.  An example is
   included for both STUN and ICE with ICE being the RECOMMENDED
   mechanism for media traversal.

4.2.1.1.  STUN Solution

   It is possible to traverse media through an 'Endpoint Independent NAT
   using STUN.  The remainder of this section provides simplified
   examples of the 'Binding Discovery' STUN usage as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis].  The STUN messages have been simplified
   and do not include 'Shared Secret' requests used to obtain the
   temporary username and password.

4.2.1.1.1.  Initiating Session

   The following example demonstrates media traversal through a NAT with
   'Address Independent' properties using the STUN 'Binding Discovery'
   usage.  It is assumed in this example that the STUN client and SIP
   Client are co-located on the same physical machine.  Note that some
   SIP signaling messages have been left out for simplicity.

              Figure 7: Endpoint Independent NAT - Initiating

   o  On deciding to initiate a SIP voice session the client starts a
      local STUN client on the interface and port that is to be used for
      media (send/receive).  The STUN client generates a standard
      'Binding Discovery' request as indicated in (1) from Figure 7
      which also highlights the source address and port for which the
      client device wishes to obtain a mapping.  The 'Binding Discovery'
      request is sent through the NAT towards the public internet and
      STUN server.
   o  Message (2) traverses the NAT and breaks out onto the public
      internet towards the public STUN server.  Note that the source
      address of the 'Binding Discovery' request now represents the
      public address and port from the public side of the NAT.
   o  The STUN server receives the request and processes it
      appropriately.  This results in a successful 'Binding Discovery'
      response being generated and returned (3).  The message contains
      details of the XOR mapped public address (contained in the STUN
      XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute) which is to be used by the
      originating client to receive media (see 'Map=NAT-PUB-1' from
      (3)).
   o  The 'Binding Discovery' response traverses back through the NAT
      using the path created by the 'Binding Discovery' request and
      presents the new XOR mapped address to the client (4).  At this
      point the process is repeated to obtain a second XOR-mapped
      address (as shown in (5)-(8)) for an alternative local address
      (Address has changed from "L-PRIV-1" to "L-PRIV-2") for an RTCP
      port.
   o  The client now constructs a SIP INVITE message(9).  Note that
      traversal of SIP is not covered in this example and is discussed
      in earlier sections of the document.  The INVITE request will use
      the addresses it has obtained in the previous STUN transactions to

      populate the SDP of the SIP INVITE as shown below:

      v=0
      o=test 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 $L-PRIV-1.address
      c=IN IP4 $NAT-PUB-1.address
      t=0 0
      m=audio $NAT-PUB-1.port RTP/AVP 0
      a=rtcp:$NAT-PUB-2.port


   o  Note that the XOR-mapped address obtained from the 'Binding
      Discovery' transactions are inserted as the connection address for
      the SDP (c=NAT-PUB-1.address).  The Primary port for RTP is also
      inserted in the SDP (m=audio NAT-PUB-1.port RTP/AVP 0).  Finally,
      the port gained from the additional 'Binding Discovery' is placed
      in the RTCP attribute (as discussed in Section 3.2.1.1) for
      traversal of RTCP (a=rtcp:NAT-PUB-2.port).
   o  The SIP signaling then traverses the NAT and sets up the SIP
      session (9-12).  Note that the client transmits media as soon as
      the 200 OK to the INVITE arrives at the client (12).  Up until
      this point the incoming media and RTCP will not pass through the
      NAT as no outbound association has been created with the far end
      client.  Two way media communication has now been established.

4.2.1.1.2.  Receiving Session Invitation

   Receiving a session for an 'Endpoint Independent' NAT using the STUN
   'Binding Discovery' usage is very similar to the example outlined in
   Section 4.2.1.1.1.  Figure 8 illustrates the associated flow of
   messages.

              Figure 8: Endpoint Independent NAT - Receiving

   o  On receiving an invitation to a SIP voice session (SIP INVITE
      request) the User Agent starts a local STUN client on the
      appropriate port on which it is to receive media.  The STUN client
      generates a standard 'Binding Discovery' request as indicated in
      (3) from Figure 8 which also highlights the source address and
      port for which the client device wishes to obtain a mapping.  The
      'Binding Discovery' request is sent through the NAT towards the
      public internet and STUN Server.
   o  'Binding Discovery' message (4) traverses the NAT and breaks out
      onto the public internet towards the public STUN server.  Note
      that the source address of the STUN requests now represents the
      public address and port from the public side of the NAT.
   o  The STUN server receives the request and processes it
      appropriately.  This results in a successful 'Binding Discovery'
      response being generated and returned (5).  The message contains
      details of the mapped public address (contained in the STUN XOR-
      MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute) which is to be used by the originating
      client to receive media (see 'Map=NAT-PUB-1' from (5)).
   o  The 'Binding Discovery' response traverses back through the NAT
      using the path created by the outgoing 'Binding Discovery' request
      and presents the new XOR-mapped address to the client (6).  At
      this point the process is repeated to obtain a second XOR-mapped
      address (as shown in (7)-(10)) for an alternative local address
      (local port has now changed and is represented by L-PRIV-2 in (7))
      for an RTCP port.
   o  The client now constructs a SIP 200 OK message (11) in response to
      the original SIP INVITE requests.  Note that traversal of SIP is
      not covered in this example and is discussed in earlier sections

      of the document.  SIP Provisional responses are also left out for
      simplicity.  The 200 OK response will use the addresses it has
      obtained in the previous STUN transactions to populate the SDP of
      the SIP 200 OK as shown below:

      v=0
      o=test 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 $L-PRIV-1.address
      c=IN IP4 $NAT-PUB-1.address
      t=0 0
      m=audio $NAT-PUB-1.port RTP/AVP 0
      a=rtcp:$NAT-PUB-2.port


   o  Note that the XOR-mapped address obtained from the initial
      'Binding Discovery' transaction is inserted as the connection
      address for the SDP (c=NAT-PUB-1.address).  The Primary port for
      RTP is also inserted in the SDP (m=audio NAT-PUB-1.port RTP/AVP
      0).  Finally, the port gained from the additional 'Binding
      Discovery' is placed in the RTCP attribute (as discussed in
      Section 3.2.1.1) for traversal of RTCP (a=rtcp:NAT-PUB-2.port).
   o  The SIP signaling then traverses the NAT and sets up the SIP
      session (11-14).  Note that the client transmits media as soon as
      the 200 OK to the INVITE is sent to the UAC(11).  Up until this
      point the incoming media will not pass through the NAT as no
      outbound association has been created with the far end client.
      Two way media communication has now been established.

4.2.1.2.  ICE Solution

   The preferred solution for media traversal of NAT is using ICE, as
   described in Section 3.2.4, regardless of the NAT type.  The
   following examples illustrate the traversal of an 'Endpoint
   Independent' NAT when initiating the session.  The example only
   covers ICE in association with the 'Binding Discovery' and TURN
   usage.

4.2.1.2.1.  Initiating Session

   The following example demonstrates an initiating traversal through an
   'Endpoint independent' NAT using ICE.

                Figure 9: Endpoint Independent NAT with ICE

   o  On deciding to initiate a SIP voice session the SIP client 'L'
      starts a local STUN client.  The STUN client generates a standard
      Allocate request as indicated in (1) from Figure 9 which also
      highlights the source address and port combination for which the
      client device wishes to obtain a mapping.  The Allocate request is
      sent through the NAT towards the public internet.
   o  The Allocate message (2) traverses the NAT and breaks out onto the
      public internet towards the public STUN server.  Note that the
      source address of the Allocate request now represents the public
      address and port from the public side of the NAT (L-NAT-PUB-1).
   o  The STUN server receives the Allocate request and processes
      appropriately.  This results in a successful Allocate response
      being generated and returned (3).  The message contains details of
      the server reflexive address which is to be used by the
      originating client to receive media (see 'Map=L-NAT-PUB-1') from
      (3)).  It also contains an appropriate relayed address that can be
      used at the STUN server (see 'Rel=STUN-PUB-2').
   o  The Allocate response traverses back through the NAT using the
      binding created by the initial Allocate request and presents the
      new mapped address to the client (4).  The process is repeated and
      a second STUN derived set of address' are obtained, as illustrated

      in (5)-(8) in Figure 9.  At this point the User Agent behind the
      NAT has pairs of derived external server reflexive and relayed
      representations.  The client would be free to gather any number of
      external representations using any UNSAF[RFC3424] compliant
      protocol.
   o  The client now constructs a SIP INVITE message (9).  The INVITE
      request will use the addresses it has obtained in the previous
      STUN/TURN interactions to populate the SDP of the SIP INVITE.
      This should be carried out in accordance with the semantics
      defined in the ICE specification[I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice], as shown
      below in Figure 10 (*note - 'allOneLine' notation signifies line
      continuation):

                           Figure 10: ICE SDP Offer

   o  The SDP has been constructed to include all the available
      candidates that have been assembled.  The first set of candidates
      (as identified by Foundation $L1) contain two local addresses that
      have the highest priority.  They are also encoded into the
      connection (c=) and media (m=) lines of the SDP.  The second set

Internet-Draft                NAT Scenarios                   April 2008


      of candidates, as identified by Foundation $L2, contains the two
      server reflexive addresses obtained from the STUN server for both
      RTP and RTCP traffic (identified by candidate-id $L2).  This entry
      has been given a priority lower than the pair $L1 by the client.
      The third and final set of candidates represents the relayed
      addresses (as identified by $L3) obtained from the STUN server.
      This pair has the lowest priority and will be used as a last
      resort if both $L1 or $L2 fail.
   o  The SIP signaling then traverses the NAT and sets up the SIP
      session (9)-(10).  On advertising a candidate address, the client
      should have a local STUN server running on each advertised
      candidate address.  This is for the purpose of responding to
      incoming STUN connectivity checks.
   o  On receiving the SIP INVITE request (10) client 'R' also starts
      local STUN servers on appropriate address/port combinations and
      gathers potential candidate addresses to be encoded into the SDP
      (as the originating client did).  Steps (11-18) involve client 'R'
      carrying out the same steps as client 'L'.  This involves
      obtaining local, server reflexive and relayed addresses.  Client
      'R' is now ready to generate an appropriate answer in the SIP 200
      OK message (19).  The example answer follows in Figure 10 (*note -
      'allOneLine' notation signifies line continuation):

   o  The two clients have now exchanged SDP using offer/answer and can
      now continue with the ICE processing - User Agent 'L' assuming the
      role controlling agent, as specified by ICE.  The clients are now
      required to form their Candidate check lists to determine which
      will be used for the media streams.  In this example User Agent
      'L's 'Foundation 1' is paired with User Agent 'R's 'Foundation 1',
      User Agent 'L's 'Foundation 2' is paired with User Agent 'R's
      'Foundation 2', and finally User Agent 'L's 'Foundation 3' is
      paired with User Agent 'R's 'Foundation 3'.  User Agents 'L' and
      'R' now have a complete candidate check list.  Both clients now
      use the algorithm provided in ICE to determine candidate pair
      priorities and sort into a list of decreasing priorities.  In this
      example, both User Agent 'L' and 'R' will have lists that firstly
      specifies the host address (Foundation $L1), then the server
      reflexive address (Foundation $L2) and lastly the relayed address
      (Foundation $L3).  All candidate pairs have an associate state as
      specified in ICE.  At this stage, all of the candidate pairs for
      User Agents 'L' and 'R' are initialized to the 'Frozen' state.

      The User Agents then scan the list and move the candidates to the
      'Waiting' state.  At this point both clients will periodically,
      starting with the highest candidate pair priority, work their way
      down the list issuing STUN checks from the local candidate to the
      remote candidate (of the candidate pair).  As a STUN Check is
      attempted from each local candidate in the list, the candidate
      pair state transitions to 'In-Progress'.  As illustrated in (23),
      client 'L' constructs a STUN connectivity check in an attempt to
      validate the remote candidate address received in the SDP of the
      200 OK (20) for the highest priority in the check list.  As a
      private address was specified in the active address in the SDP,
      the STUN connectivity check fails to reach its destination causing
      a STUN failure.  Client 'L' transitions the state for this
      candidate pair to 'Failed'.  In the mean time, Client 'L' is
      attempting a STUN connectivity check for the second candidate pair
      in the returned SDP with the second highest priority (24).  As can
      be seen from messages (24) to (29), the STUN Bind request is
      successful and returns a positive outcome for the connectivity
      check.  Client 'L' is now free to steam media to the candidate
      pair.  Client 'R' also carries out the same set of binding
      requests.  It firstly (in parallel) tries to contact the active
      address contained in the SDP (30) which results in failure.
   o  In the mean time, a successful response to a STUN connectivity
      check by User Agent 'R' (27) results in a tentative check in the
      reverse direction - this is illustrated by messages (31) to (36).
      Once this check has succeeded, User Agent 'R' can transition the
      state of the appropriate candidate to 'Succeeded', and media can
      be sent (RTP).  The previously described check confirm on both
      sides (User Agent 'L' and 'R') that connectivity can be achieved
      using the appropriate candidate pair.  User Agent 'L', as the
      controlling client now sends another connectivity check for the
      candidate pair, this time including the 'USE-CANDIDATE' attribute
      as specified in ICE to signal the chosen candidate.  This exchange
      is illustrated in messages (37) to (42).
   o  As part of the process in this example, both 'L' and 'R' will now
      complete the same connectivity checks for part 2 of the component
      named for the favored 'Foundation' selected for use with RTCP.
      The connectivity checks for part '2' of the candidate component
      are shown in 'L'(43-48) and 'R'(49-54).  Once this has succeeded,
      User Agent 'L' as the controlling client sends another
      connectivity check for the candidate pair.  This time the 'USE-
      CANDIDATE' attribute is again specified to signal the chosen
      candidate for component '2'.
   o  The candidates have now been fully verified (and selected) and as
      they are the highest priority, an updated offer (61-62) is now
      sent from the offerer (client 'L') to the answerer (client 'R')
      representing the new active candidates.  The new offer would look
      as follows:

4.2.2.  Address and Port Dependant NAT

4.2.2.1.  STUN Failure

   This section highlights that while STUN is the preferred mechanism
   for traversal of NAT, it does not solve every case.  The use of basic
   STUN on its own will not guarantee traversal through every NAT type,
   hence the recommendation that ICE is the preferred option.

         Figure 14: Port/Address Dependant NAT with STUN - Failure

   The example in Figure 14 is conveyed in the context of a client
   behind the 'Port/Address Dependant' NAT initiating a call.  It should
   be noted that the same problem applies when a client receives a SIP
   invitation and is behind a Port/Address Dependant NAT.
   o  In Figure 14 the client behind the NAT obtains a server reflexive
      representation using standard STUN mechanisms (1)-(4) that have
      been used in previous examples in this document (e.g
      Section 4.2.1.1.1).
   o  The external mapped address (server reflexive) obtained is also
      used in the outgoing SDP contained in the SIP INVITE request(5).
   o  In this example the client is still able to send media to the
      external client.  The problem occurs when the client outside the
      NAT tries to use the reflexive address supplied in the outgoing
      INVITE request to traverse media back through the 'Port/Address
      Dependent' NAT.
   o  A 'Port/Address Dependant' NAT has differing rules from the
      'Endpoint Independent' type of NAT (as defined in RFC4787
      [RFC4787]).  For any internal IP address and port combination,
      data sent to a different external destination does not provide the
      same public mapping at the NAT.  In Figure 14 the STUN query
      produced a valid external mapping for receiving media.  This
      mapping, however, can only be used in the context of the original
      STUN request that was sent to the STUN server.  Any packets that
      attempt to use the mapped address, that do not originate from the
      STUN server IP address and optionally port, will be dropped at the
      NAT.  Figure 14 shows the media being dropped at the NAT after (7)
      and before (8).  This then leads to one way audio.

4.2.2.2.  TURN Usage Solution

   As identified in Section 4.2.2.1, STUN provides a useful tool kit for
   the traversal of the majority of NATs but fails with Port/Address
   Dependant NAT.  This led to the development of the TURN usage
   solution [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] which uses the STUN toolkit to create
   a profile.  It allows a client to request a relayed address at the
   STUN server rather than a reflexive representation.  This then
   introduces a media relay in the path for NAT traversal (as described
   in Section 3.2.3).  The following example explains how the TURN usage
   solves the previous failure when using STUN to traverse a 'Port/
   Address Dependant' type NAT.

      Figure 15: Port/Address Dependant NAT with TURN Usage - Success

   o  In this example, client 'L' issues a TURN allocate request(1) to
      obtained a relay address at the STUN server.  The request
      traverses through the 'Port/Address Dependant' NAT and reaches the
      STUN server (2).  The STUN server generates an Allocate response

      (3) that contains both a server reflexive address (Map=NAT-PUB-1)
      of the client and also a relayed address (Rel=STUN-PUB-2).  The
      relayed address maps to an address mapping on the STUN server
      which is bound to the public pin hole that has been opened on the
      NAT by the Allocate request.  This results in any traffic sent to
      the STUN server relayed address (Rel=STUN-PUB-2) being forwarded
      to the external representation of the pin hole created by the
      Allocate request(NAT-PUB-1).
   o  The TURN derived address (STUN-PUB-2) arrives back at the
      originating client(4) in an Allocate response.  This address can
      then be used in the SDP for the outgoing SIP INVITE request as
      shown in the following example (note that the example also
      includes client 'L' obtaining a second relay address for use in
      the RTCP attribute (5-8)):
   o

      v=0
      o=test 2890844342 2890842164 IN IP4 $L-PRIV-1
      c=IN IP4 $STUN-PUB-2.address
      t=0 0
      m=audio $STUN-PUB-2.port RTP/AVP 0
      a=rtcp:$STUN-PUB-3.port


   o  On receiving the INVITE request, the UAS is able to stream media
      and RTCP to the relay address (STUN-PUB-2 and STUN-PUB-3) at the
      STUN server.  As shown in Figure 15 (between messages (12) and
      (13), the media from the UAS is directed to the relayed address at
      the STUN server.  The STUN server then forwards the traffic to the
      open pin holes in the Port/Address Dependant NAT (NAT-PUB-1 and
      NAT-PUB-2).  The media traffic is then able to traverse the 'Port/
      Address Dependant' NAT and arrives back at client 'L'.
   o  The TURN usage of STUN on its own will work for 'Port/Address
      Dependent' and other types of NAT mentioned in this specification
      but should only be used as a last resort.  The relaying of media
      through an external entity is not an efficient mechanism for NAT
      traversal and comes at a high processing cost.

4.2.2.3.  ICE Solution

   The previous two examples have highlighted the problem with using
   core STUN usage for all forms of NAT traversal and a solution using
   TURN usage for the Address/Port Dependant NAT case.  As mentioned
   previously in this document, the RECOMMENDED mechanism for traversing
   all varieties of NAT is using ICE, as detailed in Section 3.2.4.  ICE
   makes use of core STUN, TURN usage and any other UNSAF[RFC3424]
   compliant protocol to provide a list of prioritized addresses that
   can be used for media traffic.  Detailed examples of ICE can be found

   in Section 4.2.1.2.1.  These examples are associated with an
   'Endpoint Independent' type NAT but can be applied to any NAT type
   variation, including 'Address/Port Dependant' type NAT.  The ICE
   procedures carried out are the same.  For a list of candidate
   addresses, a client will choose where to send media dependant on the
   results of the STUN connectivity checks and associated priority
   (highest priority wins).  It should be noted that the inclusion of a
   NAT displaying Address/Port Dependent properties does not
   automatically result in relayed media.  In fact, ICE processing will
   avoid use of media with the exception of two clients which both
   happen to be behind a NAT using Address/Port Dependent
   characteristics.  The connectivity checks and associated selection
   algorithm enable traversal in this case.  Figure 16 and following
   description provide a guide as to how this is achieved using the ICE
   connectivity checks.  This is an abbreviated example that assumes
   successful SIP offer/answer exchange and illustrates the connectivity
   check flow.

          Figure 16: Single Port/Address Dependant NAT - Success

   In this abbreviated example, Client R has already received a SIP
   INVITE request and is starting its connectivity checks with Client L.
   Client R generates a connectivity check (1) and sends to client L's
   information as presented in the SDP offer.  The request arrives at
   client L's Port/Address dependent NAT and fails to traverse as there
   is no security association.  This would then move the connectivity
   check to a failed state.  In the mean time client L has received the
   SDP answer in the SIP request and will also commence connectivity
   checks.  A check is dispatched (3) to Client R. The check is able to
   traverse the NAT due to the association set up in the previously
   failed check(1).  The full Bind request/response is shown in steps
   (3)-(8).  As part of a candidate pair, Client R will now successfully
   be able to complete the checks, as illustrated in steps (9)-(14).
   The result is a successful pair of candidates that can be used
   without the need to relay any media.

   In conclusion, the only time media needs to be relayed is a result of
   clients both behind Address/Port Dependant NAT type.  As you can see
   from the example in this section, neither side would be able to
   complete connectivity checks with the exception of the Relayed
   candidates.


5.  IPv4-IPv6 Transition

   This section describes how IPv6-only SIP user agents can communicate
   with IPv4-only SIP user agents.  While the techniques discussed in
   this draft primarily contain examples of traversing NATs to allow
   communications between hosts in private and public networks, they are
   by no means limited to such scenarios.  The same NAT traversal
   techniques can also be used to establish communication in a
   heterogeneous network environment -- e.g., communication between an
   IPv4 host and an IPv6 host.

5.1.  IPv4-IPv6 Transition for SIP Signaling

   IPv4-IPv6 translations at the SIP level usually take place at dual-
   stack proxies that have both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS entries.  Since this
   translations do not involve NATs that are placed in the middle of two
   SIP entities, they fall outside the scope of this document.  A
   detailed description of this type of translation can be found in
   [I-D.camarillo-sipping-v6-transition]

5.2.  IPv4-IPv6 Transition for Media

   Figure 17 shows a network of IPv6 SIP user agents that has a relay
   with a pool of public IPv4 addresses.  The IPv6 SIP user agents of
   this IPv6 network need to communicate with users on the IPv4
   Internet.  To do so, the IPv6 SIP user agents use the TURN usage to
   obtain a public IPv4 address from the relay.  The mechanism that an
   IPv6 SIP user agent follows to obtain a public IPv4 address from a
   relay using the TURN usage is the same as the one followed by a user
   agent with a private IPv4 address to obtain a public IPv4 address.
   The example in Figure 18 explains how to use the TURN usage to obtain
   an IPv4 address and how to use the ANAT semantics
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-anat] of the SDP grouping framework [RFC3388] to
   provide both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for a particular media stream.

                Figure 18: IPv6-IPv4 translation with TURN

   o  The IPv6 SIP user agent obtains a TURN-derived IPv4 address by
      issuing a STUN Allocate request (1).  The STUN server generates a
      response that contains a relayed IPv4 address using the TURN
      usage.  This IPv4 address maps to the IPv6 source address of the
      STUN Allocate request, which the IPv6 address of the SIP user
      agent.  This results in any traffic being sent to the IPv4 address
      provided by STUN server (192.0.2.2:25000) will be redirected to
      the IPv6 address of the SIP user agent ([2001:DB8::1]:30000).
   o  The TURN-derived address (192.0.2.2:25000) arrives back at the
      originating user agent (2).  This address can then be used in the
      SDP for the outgoing SIP INVITE request.  The user agent builds
      two media lines, one with its IPv6 address and the other with the

      IPv4 address that was just obtained.  The user agent groups both
      media lines using the ANAT semantics as shown below (note that the
      RTCP attribute in the IPv4 media line would have been obtained by
      another TURN-derived address which is not shown in the call flow
      for simplicity).


      v=0
      o=test 2890844342 2890842164 IN IP6 2001:DB8::1
      t=0 0
      a=group:ANAT 1 2
      m=audio 20000 RTP/AVP 0
      c=IN IP6 2001:DB8::1
      a=mid:1
      m=audio 25000 RTP/AVP 0
      c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2
      a=rtcp:25001
      a=mid:2

   o  On receiving the INVITE request, the user agent server rejects the
      IPv6 media line by setting its port to zero in the answer and
      starts sending media to the IPv4 address in the offer.  The IPv6
      user agent sends media through the relay as well, as shown in
      Figure 18.
