    <abstract>
      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to
      provide a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the UA when
      the user is alerted. This is done using the Alert-Info header field.
      However, the reference addresses only network resources with specific
      rendering properties. There is currently no support for predefined
      standard identifiers for describing the semantics of the alerting
      situation or the characteristics of the alerting signal, without being
      tied to a particular rendering. To overcome this limitation and support
      new applications, a new family of URNs for use in SIP Alert-Info header
      fields is defined in this specification.     
</t>
<t>This document normatively updates <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>, the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP). It 
        changes the usage of the SIP Alert-Info header
        field defined in the <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> by additionally
        allowing its use in all provisional responses to INVITE (except the
        100 response).</t>
      <t></t>

    <note title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="Motivation">
        <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref
        target="RFC3261"></xref> includes a means to suggest to a user agent
        (UA) a particular ringback tone or ring tone to be used during session
        establishment. In <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> this is done by
        including a URI in the Alert-Info header field, that specifies the
        tone. The URI is most commonly the HTTP URL to the audio file. On the
        receipt of the Alert-Info header field the user agent may fetch the
        referenced ringback tone or ring tone and play it to the user.</t>

        <t>This mechanism hinders interoperability when there is no common
        understanding of the meaning of the referenced tone, which might be
        country- or vendor-specific. It can lead to problems for the user
        trying to interpret the tone and for the UA wanting to substitute its
        own tone (e.g., in accordance with user preferences) or provide an
        alternative alerting mode (e.g., for hearing-impaired users). If
        caller and callee are from different countries, the understanding of
        the tones may vary significantly. Hearing impaired users may not sense
        the specific tone if it is provided as an audio file. The tone per se
        is also not useful for automata.</t>
 
        <t>There are currently interoperability issues around the use of the
        Alert-Info header field when not using an external ring file. For
        example, consider the PBX special ring tone for an external (to the
        PBX) caller. Different vendors use different approaches such as:
        Alert-Info: &lt;file://ring.pcm&gt;;alert=normal where ring.pcm is a
        dummy file or: Alert-Info: &lt;file://normal.ring.pcm&gt; or:
        Alert-Info: &lt;sip:normal-ringtone@example.com&gt;. As a result,
        Alert-Info currently only works when the same vendor provides proxy
        and UA, as only then is the same "fake" proprietary URI convention
        used.</t>

        <t>Another limitation of the current solution is that the referenced
        tones are tied to particular rendering. It is not possible to provide
        semantic indications or names for rendering characteristics that
        signals the intent and allows the recipient to decide how to render
        the received information in an appropriate way.</t>

        <t>To solve the described issues, this specification defines the new
        URN namespace 'alert' for the Alert-Info header field that allows for
        programmatic user interface adaptation and for conversion of
        equivalent alerting tones in the Public Switched Telephone Network
        (PSTN) when the client is a gateway. The work to standardize an
        Alert-Info URN will increase SIP interoperability for this header
        field by replacing proprietary conventions used today.</t>

        <t>Using the 'alert' namespace provides syntax for several different
        application spaces, e. g.:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Names for service indications, such as call waiting or
            automatic callback, not tied to any particular rendering.</t>

            <t>Names for common ring tones generated by PBX phones for cases
            such as an internal enterprise caller, external caller, ringback
            tone after a transfer failure or expiration of a hold timer,
            etc.</t>

            <t>Names for country-specific ringback tones.</t>

            <t>Names for things with specific renderings that aren't purely
            audio. They might be static icons, video sequences, text, etc.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Some advantages of a URN rather than a URL of a downloadable
        resource:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Do not need to download it or deal with security issues
            associated with dereferencing.</t>

            <t>No formatting or compatibility issues.</t>

            <t>No security risk of rendering something unexpected and
            undesirable.</t>

            <t>The tone can be stored locally in whatever format and at
            whatever quality level is appropriate, because it is specified "by
            name" rather than "by value".</t>

            <t>It is easier to make policy decisions about whether to use it
            or not.</t>

            <t>It facilitates translation for the hearing impaired.</t>
          </list> The downside is that if the recipient does not understand
        the URN then it will only be able to render a default ringback tone or
        ring tone.</t>

        <t>This document creates a new URN namespace and registry for alert
        indications and registers some initial values.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Alert-Info Header Field Usage Change">
        <t>This specification changes the usage of the SIP Alert-Info header
        field defined in the <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> by additionally
        allowing its use in all provisional responses to INVITE (except the
        100 response).</t>

        <t>In practice, this specification extends Alert-Info in that it will
        cause the use of a new class of URIs and the use of multiple URIs.
        Backward compatibility issues are not expected, as devices that do not
        understand an Alert-Info URN should ignore it, and devices should not
        malfunction upon receiving multiple Alert-Info alert-params (which was
        syntactically permitted before, but rarely used).</t>
      </section>

      <section  title="Terminology">
        <t>This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles
        involved in the use of alerting indications in SIP. A "specifier"
        sends an "alerting indication" (one or more URNs in an Alert-Info
        header) to a "renderer" which then "renders" a "signal" or "rendering"
        based on the indication to a human user. A "category" is a
        characteristic whose "values" can be used to classify indications.</t>

        <t>This specification uses the terms "ring tone" and "ringback tone".
        A "ring tone" or "calling signal" (terminology used in <xref
        target="E182"></xref>) is a signal generated by the callee's
        end device, advising the callee about an incoming call. A "ringback
        tone" or "ringing tone" (terminology used in <xref
        target="E182"></xref>) is a signal advising the caller that a
        connection has been made and that a ring tone is being rendered to the
        callee.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section  title="Requirements">
      <t>This section discusses the requirements for an alerting indication to
      transport the semantics of the alerting situation or the characteristics
      of the rendering.</t>

      <t>REQ-1: The mechanism will allow user agents (UAs) and proxies to
      provide in the Alert-Info header field an alerting indication which
      describes the semantics of the signaling situation or the
      characteristics of the rendering and allows the recipient to decide how
      to render the received information to the user.</t>

      <t>REQ-2: The mechanism will allow the alerting indication to be
      specified "by name" rather than "by value", to enable local policy
      decisions whether to use it or not.</t>

      <t>REQ-3: The mechanism will enable alerting indications to represent a
      wide variety of signals, which have many largely-orthogonal
      characteristics.</t>

      <t>REQ-4: has been deleted. To avoid confusion, the number will not be
      reused.</t>

      <t>REQ-5: The mechanism will enable the set of alerting indications to
      be able to support extensibility by a wide variety of organizations that
      are not coordinated with each other. Extensions will be able to: 
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="- add further values to any existing category " />

            <t hangText="- add further categories that are orthogonal to existing categories " />

            <t hangText="- semantically subdivide the meaning provided by any existing indication" />
          </list>
        REQ-6: The mechanism will be flexible, so new alerting
      indications can be defined in the future, when SIP-applications evolve.
      E. g. Alert-Info URNs could identify specific media by name, such as
      "Beethoven's Fifth", and the end device could render some small part of
      it as a ring tone.</t>

      <t>REQ-7a: The mechanism will provide only an indication capability, not
      a negotiation capability. </t>

     <t>REQ-7b:  The mechanism will not require an alerting
      indication to depend on context provided by a previous alerting
      indication in either direction.</t>

      <t>REQ-8: The mechanism will allow transmission in the Alert-Info header
      field of SIP INVITE requests and provisional 1xx responses excepting the
      100 responses.</t>

      <t>REQ-9: The mechanism will be able to accommodate renderers that are
      customized with a limited or uncommon set of signals they can render and
      renderers that are provided with a set of signals that have uncommon
      semantics. (The canonical example is a UA for the hearing-impaired,
      customized with an uncomon set of signals, video or text instead of
      audio. By REQ-7, the renderer has no way of transmitting this fact to
      the specifier.)</t>

      <t>REQ-10: The mechanism will allow an alerting indication to reliably
      carry all extensions if the specifier and the renderer have designs that
      are properly coordinated.</t>

      <t>REQ-11: The mechanism will allow a renderer to select a tone that
      approximates to that intended by the specifier if the renderer is unable
      to provide the precise tone indicated.</t>

      <t>REQ-12: The mechanism will support alerting indications relating to
      services such as call waiting, forward, transfer-recall, auto-callback
      and hold-recall.</t>

      <t>REQ-13: The mechanism will allow rendering common PBX ring tone
      types.</t>

      <t>REQ-14: The mechanism will allow rendering specific country ringback
      tones.</t>

      <t>REQ-15: The mechanism will allow rendering tones for emergency
      alerts. (Use cases and values definition are not subject of this
      specification.)</t>

      <t>REQ-16: The mechanism will allow rendering using other means than
      tones, e.g. text or images.</t>

      <t>REQ-17: The mechanism will allow TDM gateways to map ring/ringback
      tones from legacy protocols to SIP at the edge of a network, e.g.
      national ring tones as defined in TIA/EIA-41-D and 3GPP2 A.S0014. (Use
      cases and values definition are not subject of this specification.)</t>

      <t>REQ-18: The mechanism will ensure that if an UA receives Alert-Info
      URNs or portions of an Alert-Info URN it does not understand, it can
      ignore them.</t>

      <t>REQ-19: The mechanism will allow storage of the actual encoding of
      the rendering locally rather than fetching it.</t>

      <t>REQ-20: The mechanism must provide a simple way to combine two
      alerting indications to produce an alerting indication that requests a
      combination of the intentions of the two alerting indications, where any
      contradictions or conflicts between the two alerting indications are
      resolved in favor of the intention of the first alerting indication.</t>

    <section anchor="UseCases" title="Use Cases">
      <t>This section describes some use cases for which the Alert-Info URN
      mechanism is needed today.</t>

      <section anchor="PBX_Tones" title="PBX Ring Tones">
        <t>This section defines some commonly encountered ring tones on PBX or
        business phones. They are as follows:</t>

        <section title="normal">
          <t>This tone indicates that the default or normal ring tone should
          be rendered. This is essentially a no-operation Alert-Info URN and
          should be treated by the UA as if no Alert-Info URN is present. This
          is most useful when Alert-Info header field parameters are being
          used. For example, in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances"></xref>, an Alert-Info
          header field needs to be present containing the "appearance"
          parameter, but no special ring tone needs to be specified.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="external">
          <t>This tone is used to indicate that the caller is external to the
          enterprise or PBX system. This could be a call from the PSTN or from
          a SIP trunk.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="internal">
          <t>This tone is used to indicate that the caller is internal to the
          enterprise or PBX system. The call could have been originated from
          another user on this PBX or on another PBX within the
          enterprise.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="priority">
          <t>A PBX tone needs to indicate that a priority level alert should
          be applied for the type of alerting specified (e.g. internal
          alerting).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="short ">
          <t>In this case the alerting type specified (e.g. internal alerting)
          should be rendered shorter than normal. In contact centers, this is
          sometimes referred to as "abbreviated ringing" or a "zip tone".</t>
        </section>

        <section title="delayed">
          <t>In this case the alerting type specified should be rendered after
          a short delay. In some bridged line/shared line appearance
          implementations, this is used so that the bridged line does not ring
          at exactly the same time as the main line, but is delayed a few
          seconds.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="ServiceTones" title="Service Tones">
        <t>These tones are used to indicate specific PBX and public network
        telephony services.</t>

        <section title="call-waiting">
          <t>The Call Waiting Service <xref target="TS24.615"></xref> permits
          a callee to be notified of an incoming call while the callee is
          engaged in an active or held call. Subsequently, the callee can
          either accept, reject, or ignore the incoming call. There is an
          interest on the caller side to be informed about the call waiting
          situation on the callee side. Having this information the caller can
          decide whether to continue waiting for callee to pickup or better to
          call some time later when it is estimated that the callee could have
          finished the ongoing conversation. To provide this information, the
          callee's UAS ( or proxy) aware of the call waiting condition can add
          the call-waiting indication to the Alert-Info header field in the
          180 Ringing response. As call-waiting information may be subject to
          the callee's privacy concerns, the exposure of this information
          shall be done only if explicitly required by the user.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="forward">
          <t>This feature is used in a 180 Ringing response when a call
          forwarding feature has been initiated on an INVITE. Many PBX system
          implement a forwarding "beep" followed by normal ringing to indicate
          this. Note that a 181 response can be used in place of this URN.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="transfer-recall">
          <t>This feature is used when a blind transfer <xref
          target="RFC5589"></xref> has been performed by a server on behalf of
          the transferor and fails. Instead of failing the call, the server
          calls back the transferor, giving them another chance to transfer or
          otherwise deal with the call. This service tone is used to
          distinguish this INVITE from any other normal incoming call.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="auto-callback">
          <t>This feature is used when a user has utilized a server to
          implement an automatic callback service. When the user is available,
          the server calls back the user and utilizes this service tone to
          distinguish this from any other normal incoming call.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="hold-recall">
          <t>This feature is used when a server implements a call hold timer
          on behalf of an endpoint. After a certain period of time of being on
          hold, the user who placed the call on hold is alerted to either
          retrieve the call or otherwise dispose of the call. This service
          tone is used to distinguish this case from any other normal incoming
          call.</t>

      <section anchor="CountryTones"
               title="Country-specific ringback tone indications for the public telephone network">

          <t>The Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the "alert" URNs is
          called alert-identifier and has a hierarchical structure. The
          left-most label is called "alert-category" and is separated from the
          right-side of the alert-identifier, the alert-indication, by a
          colon. The general form is
          urn:alert:{alert-category}:{alert-indication}.</t>

          <t>In this specification, following alert-categories identifiers are
          described: "service" , "priority" , "source" , "duration", "delay"
          and "locale". The alert-category set can be extended in the
          future.</t>

          <t>The categories are orthogonal. Any Alert-Info URN defined in this
          specification is syntactically valid for ring and ringback tones and
          can be used in INVITE requests or in provisional 1xx responses
          excepting the 100 response.</t>

          <t>The alert-indications are hierarchical identifiers, consisting of
          one label or a sequence of labels separated by colons. The set of
          allowable characters is the same as that for domain names <xref
          target="RFC1123" />. Labels are case-insensitive, but MUST be
          specified in all lower-case.</t>

          both technical and non-technical users, on a variety of devices and

          allow Internet users to receive more information and enable them to
          better make decisions about accepting an offered call, or get better
          feedback on the progress of a call they have made. User interfaces
          for the perception impaired users can better render the ringback
          tone indication based on the Alert-Info URN. The assignment of
          identifiers is described in <xref target="IANA" />. The Alert-Info
          URN does not prescribe a particular resolution mechanism, but it is

               title="General Extensibility Rules">
        <t> The set of Alert-Info URNs is intended to be extensible. An extension "at the top level" 
creates an entirely new category (or characteristic), an extension "at the second level" creates a
new indication value for a category, an extension "at the third level"
creates a subdivision of a indication value, etc.  Extensions at lower
levels are preferred over those at upper levels.</t>

<t>URNs allow in principle infinite subdivision of existing indication
values, although most of the standard Alert-Info URNs give only one level of
subdivision and a few give two levels of
subdivision.
      </t>
<t>The process for defining new  Alert-Info URNs is described in section <xref target="NewAlert-identifiers"></xref>. 
      Adding new categories and adding alert-indication values other than
        via the "private" mechanism described above is standards action.</t> 

      </section>

      <section anchor="ExtensionsRulesforIndependentOrganizations"
               title="Extensions Rules for Independent Organizations">
      
 <t>
The "&lt;private-name&gt;" syntax is for proprietary extensions
specific to independent organizations. The "&lt;private-name&gt;" is
 used in the form of a "reverse FQDN" of the entity that defines the extension, possibly
followed by further components.  Standard URNs will never contain
a  ".", so proprietary extensions need no further
marker. This gives a way of assigning unique names without the need for
a new registry. The namespace for each alert category is independent.
 Those assigning new names must ensure they are in a position to assign
 names uniquely for the FQDN they choose. </t>
 <t>For example,  Avaya could use urn:alert:service:call-waiting:avaya.com, 
  which is the Avaya private version for call-waiting or it may have several distinct 
  private versions of call-waiting, e.g. urn:alert:service:call-waiting:abc.avaya.com and
urn:alert:service:call-waiting:def.avaya.com (which are siblings in the tree 
under urn:alert:service:call-waiting). Also
it can subdivide its private version of call-waiting in 
urn:alert:service:call-waiting:avaya.com:abc and
urn:alert:service:call-waiting:avaya.com:def
(which are siblings in the tree under service:call-waiting:avaya.com).
</t>

        <t>Adding new categories and adding alert-indication values 
        via the "private" mechanism is not a standards action.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Combinations" title="Combinations of Alert-Info URNs and Priority Rules ">
      <t>This section describes combination rules for the case when all
      the Alert-Info header fields only contain Alert-Info URNs. Combinations
      of URNs and URIs in the Alert-Info header fields of the same SIP-message
      are not defined in this specification.</t>

      <t>In many cases, more than one URNs will be needed to fully define a
      particular tone. This is done by including multiple Alert-Info URNs, in
      one or more Alert-Info header fields in a request or a response. For
      example, an internal, priority call could be indicated by Alert-Info:
      &lt;urn:alert:source:internal&gt;, &lt;urn:alert:priority:high&gt;. A
      priority call waiting tone could be indicated by Alert-Info:
      &lt;urn:alert:service:call-waiting&gt;,
      &lt;urn:alert:priority:high&gt;.</t>
    
<t>
The sender of the Alert-Info header may include an
arbitrary list of Alert-Info URNs, even if they are redundant or
contradictory.  An earlier URN has priority over any later
contradictory URN.  This allows any element to modify a list of URNs
to require a feature value (by adding a URN at the beginning of the
list) or to suggest a feature value (by adding a URN at the end of the
list).</t>

      <t>The receiving UA attempts to match the received
      Alert-Info URNs combination with the signal(s) it is able to render. </t>

      <t>The implementation is free
      to ignore any or all parts of the received Alert-Info URNs.  The exact way in which a UA 
       renders a received combination of Alert-Info URNs is 
      left as an implementation issue.  However, the implementation  MUST comply to following rules:</t>

    <t><list>  

  <t>a. Each alert-info URN has precedence over all URNs that follow it, and
  its interpretation is subordinate to all URNs that precede it.</t>

<t>b. If the UA cannot implement the effect of a URN (because it does not
  recognize the URN or the URN's effect is precluded by
  preceding URNs), the UA removes the final
 name of the URN repeatedly until either (1) the resulting URN is
  recognized and can be given effect by some signal (without reducing
  the degree of expression of any preceding URN), or (2) the resulting
  URN is reduced to having no names.  In case (2), that URN in the
  series cannot be given effect, so it is ignored.</t>

 <t>c. In case that after processing all the URNs, the UA can generate more
  than one signal that are equally effective at expressing the URNs
  (under the preceding rules), one of those signals is selected.  When
  selecting from the set of equally effective signals, any particular
  signal is preferred over all signals that are more specific (in
  regard to the defined meaning of the signal to the user) than that
  particular signal.  (E.g., if each signal expresses a set of
  alert-indications (values) for a set of alert-categories (per the
  BNF), then a first signal is more specific than a second signal if
  the second signal's alert-indications are (partial or complete)
  initial portions of the first signal's corresponding
  alert-indications.)</t>

</list></t>

 <t>The following text is a non-normative example for a possible implementation. </t> 



 <t>  For each category, there is a tree of possible values.  For this
  description, we will name each tree by the category name, and name each
  node by the trailing portion of the URN.  Each URN thus corresponds to a
  node in a category tree.  Thus, there is a tree named "source", whose
  root node is also named "source", and which has the children
  source:internal, source:external, source:friend, and source:family.  
For example, urn:alert:source:external is placed at the node
  "source:external" in the "source" tree. (Of course, there are an infinite number of potential additional nodes
  in the tree for private values, but we don't have to represent those
  nodes explicitly unless the device has a signal representing the
  private value.)</t>

   <t>We assign similar locations to signals, but each signal has a place in
  *every* tree.  If a signal has a simple meaning, such as "external
  source", its place in the "source" tree is source:external, but its
  place in every other feature tree is at the root node, meaning that it
  has no particular meaning for that feature.</t>

  <t> A signal that has a complex meaning may have non-root positions in
  more than one feature tree.  For example, an "external, high
  priority" signal would be placed at source:external and
  priority:high in those trees, but be at the root in all other
  feature trees.</t>

  <t> In order to assure that the algorithm always selects at least one
  signal, we assume that there is a "default" signal, whose position in
  every feature tree is at the root.  The default signal is set up so
  that it will never be excluded from the set of acceptable signals for
  an indication, but will usually be the least-desirable signal for any
  indication.</t>

   <t>The algorithm proceeds by considering each URN in the received Alert-Info header from
  left to right, while revising a set of signals. The set of signals
  starts as the entire set of signals available to the device.  Each URN
  excludes some signals from the set, and *sorts* the signals that
  remain in the set according to how well they represent the URN.  The
  first URN is the "major sort", and has the most influence on the
  position of a signal in the set.  The second URN is a "minor sort", in
  that it arranges the orders of the signals that are tied within the
  first sort, the third URN arranges the orders of the signals that are
  tied within the first two sorts, etc.</t>

   <t>At the end of the algorithm, a final, "most minor" sort is done, which
  orders the signals which have been tied under all the sorts driven by
  the URNs.  This sort places the least specific signal *first*.</t>

   <t>Once all the URNs are processed and the sorting is done, the device
  selects the first signal in the set.</t>

   <t>Here is how a single sort step proceeds, examining a single URN to
  modify the set of signals (by excluding some signals and further
  sorting the signals that remain):</t>

<t><list style="symbols">  

     <t>The URN is at a specific node in a specific category tree.</t>

     <t>All signals in the set positioned at that node, or an ancestor node of
 the URN are kept; all other signals are removed from the set.</t>

     <t>Within any group of signals that are tied under previous sorts, place
    first those which are at the node of the URN, place second those which
    are at the parent node of the URN, etc., and place last those which
    are at the root node of the feature tree.</t>

        in a new registry called "Alert URN Labels". Thus, creating a new
        Alert-Info URN identifier requires IANA action. The policy for adding
        a new alert category is 'Standards Action'. (This document defines the
        alert categories 'service', 'source', 'priority', 'duration', 'delay'
        and 'locale'. ) The policy for assigning labels to alert-indications
        and the rules to combine them may differ for each alert-category and
        MUST be defined by the document describing the corresponding alert
        category. The entries in the registration table have the following
        format:</t>
