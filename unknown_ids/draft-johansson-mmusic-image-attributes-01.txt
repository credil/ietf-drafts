Abstract

   This draft proposes a new generic session setup attribute to make it
   possible to negotiate different image attributes such as image size.
   A possible use case is to make it possible for a e.g a low-end hand-
   held terminal to display video without the need to rescale the image,
   something that may consume large amounts of memory and processing
   power.  The draft also helps to maintain an optimal bitrate for video
   as only the image size that is desired by the receiver is
   transmitted.

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP               June 2008


1.  Introduction

   This draft proposes a new attribute to make it possible to negotiate
   different image attributes such as image size.  The term image size
   is defined here as it may differ from the physical screen size of e.g
   a hand-held terminal.  For instance it may be beneficial to display a
   video image on a part of the physical screen and leave space on the
   screen for e.g menus and other info.

   There are a number of benefits with a possibility to negotiate the
   image size:

   o  Less image distortion: Rescaling of images introduces additional
      distortion, something that can be avoided (at least on the
      receiver side) if the image size can be negotiated.

   o  Reduced complexity: Image rescaling can be quite computation
      intensive.  For low end devices this can be a problem.

   o  Optimal quality for the given bitrate: The sender does not need to
      encode an entire CIF (352x288) image if only an image size of
      288x256 is displayed on the receiver screen.  This gives a saving
      in bitrate.

   o  Memory requirement: The receiver device will know the size of the
      image and can then allocate memory accordingly.

   Several of the existing standards (see [RFC4587], [RFC4629] and
   [RFC3984]) has support for enabling the receiver to ask for different
   resolutions at different framerates.  The purpose of this memo is to
   provide for a generic mechanism and is targeted mainly at the
   negotiation of the image size but to make it more general the
   attribute is named "imageattr".  A problem statement and discussion
   that gives a motivation to this draft can be found in [S4-080144].


2.  Conventions, Definitions and Acronyms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


3.  Defintion of Attribute

   A new "imageattr" attribute is defined.  The imageattr attribute
   contains a set of different image-resolution options that the offerer
   can provide.  The receiver can then select the desired image

   attribute (e.g image size) and has then the ability to avoid costly
   transformations (e.g rescaling) of the images.  In this approach only
   the image resolution and optionally the framerate, sample aspect
   ratio and preference is covered but the framework makes it possible
   to extend with other image related attributes that makes sense.

   The syntax for the imageattr attribute is:
      Incomplete formulation:
       a=imageattr:<PT> 1*WSP *
       May be given in an offer to indicate that the answer
       MUST contain a complete formulation given below.

      Complete formulation:
       a=imageattr:<PT> 1*WSP <sar=range 1*WSP> <list>
       list = set *(1*WSP set) ; defined in RFC 4566

       <PT> is the payload type number
       sar is the a set of supported sample aspect ratios (optional)


   Each set for the complete formulation is defined by

      set=[x=range,y=range<,par=range><,fr=range><,q=value>]
       x is the horizontal image size range
       y is the vertical image size range
       fr is the framerate range for the given set (optional)
       par is a range of valid picture aspect ratios (optional)
       q is the preference for the given set in the
         range [0.0..1.0] (optional)

       range is (in matlab or octave syntax) given by
        range=value
         or
        range=[value:value]
         or
        range=[value:step:value]
         or
        range=[value,value...value]

        value is a positive integer or real value
        step is a positive integer or real value
         If step is left out in the syntax a stepsize of 1 is implied.
        Note the use of brackets [..] if more that one value specified.

   Selection of a desired image attribute entry follows the syntax:

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP               June 2008


      a=imageattr:<PT> 1*WSP <sar=value 1*WSP> \
         <[<fr=range,>x=value,y=value]>
     or
      a=imageattr:<PT> 1*WSP <sar_w=value 1*WSP sar_h=value 1*WSP> \
         <[<fr=range,>x=value,y=value]>

     "\" denotes a line break that MUST NOT be present in the actual SDP

   The imageattr attribute is bound to a specific media by means of the
   payload type number.  Several imageattr can be defined e.g for
   different video codec alternatives conditioned that the payload type
   number differs.

   The incomplete formulation (e.g "a=imageattr:97 *" ) in an offer
   indicates that the answer MUST contain a complete formulation or that
   the imageattr is removed from the answer.  This is used for offer/
   answer in a session in the likely case that the two participants have
   different display capabilities.

   The preference for each set is 0.5 by default, setting the optional q
   parameter to another value makes it possible to set different
   preferences for the sets.

   The sar parameter is a list of the possible SAR (Sample Aspect Ratio)
   conversions that is supported by the encoder, this applies to all the
   defined sets for the given imageattr line.  This list is according to
   table E1 in [H.264].  A value of 255 indicates that the encoder
   supports any conversion.  In this case the answer should specify the
   desired sar_w and sar_h values (if desired).  The answer SDP
   indicates what sample aspect ratio (on the receiver display) that the
   sender shall compensate for.

   The par (width/height = x/y ratio) parameter indicates a range of
   picture aspect ratios.  This is used to limit the number of x and y
   image size combinations, par is given as

      par=[par_min,par_max]

   Where par_min and par_max are the min and max allowed picture aspect
   ratios.

   The offerer MUST be able to support the image attributes that it
   offers.  As an example, an offerer that cannot provide with
   compensation for sample aspect ratios MUST NOT include sar in the
   offer.  The receiver MAY accept the imageattr but is not required to
   do so.  The receiver MUST only include a valid entry taken from the
   offer in the SDP answer.

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP               June 2008


   The answerer MUST only pick a valid entry from the multidimensional
   solution space spanned by the offer.  If "fr" is given in the offer
   it MUST be present in the answer, the answer MAY limit the fr range
   but MUST NOT increase the range.

3.1.  SDPCapNeg

   For use with the SDP capability negotiation framework (SDPCapNeg) an
   extra attribute "imcap" is defined with the syntax:

      a=imcap:<tag> 1*WSP  <sar=range 1*WSP> <list>

      <tag> is a number from 1 to 1^32-1 both included.
      list = set *(1*WSP set) ; defined in RFC 4566

   The set and sar is defined as earlier in this text.

   The imcap attributes are referenced with the parameter "im" in the
   pcfg and acfg lines.  Several imcap may be referenced in the
   potential configurations.

   The ability to support the imcap attribute MUST be specified with the
   "im-v0" identifier on the a=creq line or using the "+" option on the
   pcfg line and optionally also on the a=csup line.

3.2.  Asymmetric Sessions

   As the display capabilities in the devices involved in a session may
   vary greatly it comes natural that this will likely lead to an
   asymmetry in terms of display size.

   As an example Alice (offerer) may prefer an image size of 320x240
   while Bob prefers an image size of 800x600.  This problem is made
   even worse if the two participants have different sample aspect
   ratios on the displays.

   To solve this issue it is necessary to use the sendonly and recvonly
   attributes as described in [RFC3264].  An example how this may look
   like is found in Section 4.6.


4.  Examples

   A few examples to highlight the syntax

4.1.  Example 1

      a=imageattr:97 sar=[1:16] [x=800,y=640,q=0.6] [x=480,y=320]



Johansson               Expires December 28, 2008               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP               June 2008


   Two image resolution alternatives are offered with 800x600 having the
   highest preference, furthermore the encoder supports conversion for
   the sar indices 1..16 given in table E1 in [H.264].

   The answer may look like

      a=imageattr:97 sar=2 [x=800,y=640]

   Indicating that the receiver wish the encoder to compensate for a
   sample aspect ratio of 12:11 and desires an image size on its screen
   of 800x600.

4.2.  Example 2

      a=imageattr:97 sar=255 [fr=[5,15],x=800,y=640] \
           [fr=[15,30],x=480,y=320]

   Two image resolution alternatives with different framerates are
   offered, furthermore the encoder supports conversion for any sample
   aspect ratio.

   The answer may look like

      a=imageattr:97 sar_w=13 sar_h=11 [x=480,y=320]

   Indicating a desired image size of 480x320 and requesting the encoder
   to compensate for a sample aspect ratio of 13:11.  No specific
   framerate is requested.

4.3.  Example 3

      a=imageattr:97 \
           [x=[480:16:800],y=[320:16:640],par=[1.2,1.3],q=0.6] \
           [x=[176:8:208],y=[144:8:176],par=[1.2,1.3]]

   Two image resolution sets are offered with the first having a higher
   preference (q=0.6).  The x-axis resolution can take the values 480 to
   800 in 16 pixels steps and 176 to 208 in 8 pixels steps.  The par
   parameter limits the set of possible x and y screen resolution
   combinations such that 800x640 (par=1.25) is a valid combination
   while 800x672 (par=1.19) or 800x608 (par=1.31) are invalid
   combinations.

4.4.  Example 4

   Given the offer

      a=imageattr:98 [x=[480:16:800],y=[320:16:640]] \

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP               June 2008


           [x=[176:8:208],y=[144:8:176]]

   An answer may look like

      a=imageattr:98 [x=192,y=160]

   Indicating that the answerer wish to render the video through a
   rectangular 192x160 block (image).

4.5.  Example 5 (SDPCapNeg)

   An offer using SDPCapNeg may look like

      m=video ....
      a=creq:med-v0,im-v0
      m=mcap:1 H_264
      a=imcap:1 [x=[480:16:800],y=[320:16:640]] \
           [x=[176:8:208],y=[144:8:176]]
      a=pcfg t=.. a=.. m=.. im=1 pt=1:97

   The SDP answer may then look like

      m=video ....
      a=csup:med-v0,im-v0
      a=imageattr:97 [x=192,y=160]
      a=acfg t=.. a=.. m=.. im=1 pt=1:97

   Note the inclusion of the "clear text" imageattr in the answer that
   gives the desired image size.

4.6.  Example 6 (Asymmetry)

   The offer/answer procedure between Alice (offer) and Bob with
   different display capabilities may look like below

      Offer:
      m=video 12340 RTP/AVP 97
      a=rtpmap:97 H264/90000
      a=imageattr:97 [x=[480:16:800],y=[320:16:640]] \
           [x=[176:8:208],y=[144:8:176]]
      a=sendonly
      m=video 12342 RTP/AVP 98
      a=rtpmap:98 H264/90000
      a=imageattr:98 *
      a=recvonly

   The image attribute for the 2nd m-line is incomplete, which means
   that Bob must fill in the imageattr capabilities that it can support,

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP               June 2008


   optionally Bob may remove this attribute for the 2nd m-line, thus
   indicating that it does not offer any special image attributes for
   the media in the direction from Bob to Alice other than what may be
   supported by the payload format.

   The answer may look like below
      Answer:
      m=video 12340 RTP/AVP 97
      a=rtpmap:97 H264/90000
      a=imageattr:97 [x=480,y=320]
      a=recvonly
      m=video 12342 RTP/AVP 98
      a=rtpmap:98 H264/90000
      a=imageattr:98 sar=[1:16] [x=[480:16:800],y=[320:16:640]] \
           [x=[176:8:208],y=[144:8:176]]
      a=sendonly

   The answer indicates that Bob wish to render the received video
   stream with an image size of 480x320.  The imageattr for the 2nd
   m-line is filled with the image attribute capabilities that Bob can
   support when sending media to Alice.

   Alice receives the answer and performs another offrer/answer, the 2nd
   offer answer is necessary to make it possible for Alice to select e.g
   a desired image size.

      Offer (2):
      m=video 12340 RTP/AVP 97
      a=rtpmap:97 H264/90000
      a=imageattr:97 [x=480,y=320]
      a=sendonly
      m=video 12342 RTP/AVP 98
      a=rtpmap:98 H264/90000
      a=imageattr:98 sar=2 [x=800,y=640]
      a=recvonly

      Answer (2):
      m=video 12340 RTP/AVP 97
      a=rtpmap:97 H264/90000
      a=imageattr:97 [x=480,y=320]
      a=recvonly
      m=video 12342 RTP/AVP 98
      a=rtpmap:98 H264/90000
      a=imageattr:98 sar=2 [x=800,y=640]
      a=sendonly

   The second offer indicates that Alice prefers to render the video on
   the screen with a image size of 800x600, furthermore it indicates

Internet-Draft           Image Attributes in SDP               June 2008


   that it wants the sender (Bob) to compensate for a sample aspect
   ratio of 12:11.


5.  Issues

   Here is listed a few possible issues and observations connected to
   the use of the imageattr SDP attribute :

   o  Conflict with sprop-parameter-set: H.264 defines the sprop-
      parameter-set which may define features that are defined in this
      draft.  To avoid conflicts, sessions that use the imageattr
      attribute MUST NOT specify similar features in sprop-parameter-
      set.

   o  Image scaling on encoder side: e.g the H.264 codec is not mandated
      to rescale the video to fit a preferred receiver image size.  If
      this is the case then a possible solution is that only a part of
      the input, corresponding to the preferred size, is encoded
      (cropping).  Preferably the cropped image is also displayed as a
      miniature image on the sender display as well to avoid that the
      important parts drop out of the image.  Cropping of the image may
      also occur if the picture aspect ratio differs between the video
      camera and the preferred image size on the receiver end.

   o  Sample aspect ratios (SAR): In this draft version table E1 in
      [H.264] is referenced.  Question if it is better to reference to
      another table.

   o  Image sharpening: In normal cases image sharpening is to be
      performed after rescaling on the sender side.  There may however
      occur cases where it is preferable to do the sharpening on the
      receiver side instead.

   o  A high end device may not see any need for imageattr for it as it
      most likely has the processing capacity to rescale incoming video
      and may therefore not include the attribute in the offer.  The
      first answer MAY however include an imageattr with incomplete
      formulation, this will of course lead to extra offer/answer
      rounds.

   o  As the likelihood for asymmetric properties (different image size)
      for each participant is quite big, the outcome is likely that it
      is necessary to specify media in each direction as given in
      Section 4.6.  This in practice means more overhead in terms of
      both extra offer/answer and increased RTCP traffic.
