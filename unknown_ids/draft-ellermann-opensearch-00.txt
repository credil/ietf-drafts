1.  Introduction

   TBD - this is a DRAFT, see "Status of this Memo" above


2.  Internationalization Considerations

   TBD - this is a DRAFT, see "Status of this Memo" above


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to create one URL for each registered atom:link
   relation below <http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/> as
   specified in [RFC4287] section 4.2.7.2.  All existing atom:link
   relation templates should get the corresponding URLs, e.g., "current"
   at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/current>.

   For the remaining registered atom:link relations without template the
   corresponding URLs should redirect to the atom:link relation
   registry, e.g., for "alternate" the URL
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/alternate> can be
   redirected to the atom:link relation registry.  For consistency the
   URL <http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/> should be used for
   the atom:link registry.

3.1.  atom:link rel="search"

   Below you find the [RFC4287] registration template for the atom:link
   "search" relation under <http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/>:

   Attribute Value:  search

   Description:      TBD

   Expected display characteristics:
                     TBD

   Security considerations:
                     All general security and privacy considerations for
                     sending queries to servers specified in an URL are
                     applicable.  See RFCXXXX Section 4 for more info.

3.2.  application/opensearchdescription+xml

   Below you find the [RFC4288] registraton template for the subtype
   "opensearchdescription+xml" of the "application" media type under
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/>:

Internet-Draft           OpenSearch Description                June 2008


   Type name:        application

   Subtype name:     opensearchdescription+xml

   Required parameters:
                     There are no required parameters.

   Optional parameters:
                     charset (defaults to "UTF-8")

   Encoding considerations:
                     Identical to those of "application/xml" as
                     described in [RFC3023]; especially "UTF-8"
                     [RFC3629] and its proper subset "US-ASCII" are
                     supposed to work.
                     For non-ASCII documents served as "text/xml" the
                     "charset" parameter is required; this might be
                     relevant when authors are unable to configure the
                     server hosting their OpenSearch descriptions.

   Security considerations:
                     All general security and privacy considerations for
                     sending queries to servers specified in an URL are
                     applicable.  See RFCXXXX Section 4 for more info.

   Interoperability considerations:
                     OpenSearch descriptions use the
                     <http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/> XML name
                     space, optionally in conjunction with other XML
                     name spaces for extensions or for application
                     specific purposes.

   Published specification:
                     RFCXXXX and
                     <http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications>

   Applications that use this media type:
                     Various search cients including popular Web
                     browsers, search engines, and software libraries
                     support OpenSearch descriptions.

   Additional information:
                     TBD

   Person & email address to contact for further information:
                     TBD

Appendix A.  Document History

   Changes in version 00:

   o  This is a kind of template that could be extended to register
      rel="search" and application/opensearchdescription+xml if the
      OpenSearch community likes this approach.

   o  The change controller for a media type in the standards tree has
      to be a SDO (Standards Development Organization) recognized by the
      IESG or IAB on behalf of the IETF community, not necessarily the
      IETF itself.

   o  For atom:link relations IESG review is good enough.  Informational
      IETF RFCs are approved by the IESG in a "document action", this
      would trigger the IANA considerations in Section 3.
