Abstract 

   The Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) enables service differentiation 
   through class-based forwarding. IGP protocols (OSPF and IS-IS) have 
   already been extended to setup MTR. In order to deploy mLDP in an 
   MTR setup, mLDP is also required to become topology-aware. This 
   document specifies extensions to mLDP to support Multi-Topology 
   Routing.

2. Introduction 

   The Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) enables service differentiation 
   through class-based forwarding. For example, MTR can be used to 
   define separate IP topologies for voice, video, and data traffic 
   classes. To support MTR, an IGP maintains independent IP topologies, 
   termed as "Multi-Topologies" (MT), and computes/installs routes per 
   topology. OSPF extensions [RFC4915] and ISIS extensions [RFC5120] 
   specify the MT extensions under respective IGP. To support IGP MT, 
   similar extensions [MT-LDP] have been proposed in LDP to make LDP 
   MT-aware, and be able to setup unicast Label Switched Paths (LSPs) 
   along IGP MT routing paths. 

   Multi-point LDP (mLDP) refers to extensions in LDP to setup multi-
   point LSPs, point-to-multipoint (P2MP) or multipoint-to-multipoint 
   (MP2MP), by means of set of extensions and procedures defined in 
   [RFC6388]. In order to work in an MTR setup to take advantage of 
   MTs, it is a natural extension to make mLDP become MT-aware. This 
   document specifies the extensions to mLDP to support IGP Multi-
   Topology Routing (MTR).  

   [Editor Note: This document will be updated and synchronized with MT 
   LDP [MT-LDP] specification as/when MT LDP specification is updated]

4. MT-Scoped mLDP FECs  

   The Multi-Topology Identifier (MTID) is an identifier that is used 
   to associate an MP LSP with a certain MTR topology. This identifier 
   is part of the mLDP FEC encoding. It is part of the FEC encoding 
   because LDP peers may want to setup an MP LSP via their own defined 
   MTR policy. In order to avoid conflicting MTR policies for the same 
   mLDP FEC, the MTID needs to be a part of the FEC, so that different 
   MTID values will result in unique MP-LSP FEC elements. 

   Since the MTID is part of the FEC, it will apply to all the LDP 
   messages that potentially include an mLDP FEC element. 

   Following subsections propose the extensions to bind an mLDP FEC to 
   a topology. 

4.1.1. New MT IP Address Families 

   To extend IP address families for MT, we propose two new Address 
   Families named "MT IP" and "MT IPv6" that can be used to specify IP 
   prefixes within a topology scope. The format of the data associated 
   with these new Address Family is: 

    0                   1                   2                   3 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1   
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   
   |                     (IP) Prefix                               |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   
   |          Reserved             |        MT-ID                  |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

               Figure 1: MT IP Address Families Data Format 
 

   Where "(IP) Prefix" is an IPv4 and IPv6 address for "MT IP" and "MT 
   IPv6" AF respectively, and the field "MT-ID" corresponds to 16-bit 
   Topology ID for given prefix. The Address Family length incorporates 
   both the (IP) Prefix field, as well as following 4-octets for MT. 
   For MT IP and MT IPv6 AF, the AF length is 8 and 20 octets 
   respectively.  

4.1.2. MT MP FEC Element 

   Base mLDP specification [RFC6388] defines MP FEC Element as follows:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1    
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+     
   | MP FEC type   |    AF (IP/IPv6)               |    AF Length  |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                Root Node Address                              | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |    Opaque Length              |       Opaque Value            | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               + 
   ~                                                               ~ 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
                 Figure 2: MP FEC Element Format [RFC6388] 
    

   Where "Root Node Address" encoding is as defined for given "Address 
   Family", and whose length (in octets) is specified by the "AF 
   Length" field. 

   To extend MP FEC elements for MT, the MTID is an identifier that is 
   relevant in the context of the root address of the MP LSP. The MTID 
   identifier determines in which topology the root address needs to be 
   resolved. Since the MTID should be considered part of the mLDP FEC, 
   the most natural place to encode the MTID is as part of the root 
   address. For that reason we are proposing to use new MT IP Address 
   Family as defined in Section 4.1.1.  

   For MT mLDP, the MP FEC element's "Address Family" field will be set 
   to "MT IP" or "MT IPv6", and the FEC element will be encoded as 
   follows: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

   In the context of this document, the applicable LDP FECs for MT mLDP 
   include: 

   o  MP FEC Elements: 

       o P2MP (0x6) 

       o MP2MP Upstream (0x7) 

       o MP2MP Downstream (0x8) 

   o  Typed Wildcard FEC Element(0x5) 

   In case of "Typed Wildcard FEC Element", the sub FEC MUST be one of 
   the MP FECs listed above. 

   This specification allows the use of Topology-scoped mLDP FECs in 
   LDP label and notification messages, as applicable.  

4.2. Topology IDs  

   This document assumes the same definitions and procedures associated 
   with MT-ID as defined in [MT-LDP] specification. Additionally, it 
   defines following special topology values: 

   Default Topology (0x0): Used for backward compatibility) 

   Wildcard Topology (0xffff): Used for wildcard label operations. 

5. Multipoint MT Capability 

   "Multipoint MT Capability" is a new LDP capability, defined in 
   accordance with LDP Capability definition guidelines [RFC5561], that 
   is to be advertised to its peers by an mLDP speaker to announce its 
   capability to support MTR and the procedures specified in this 
   document. This capability MAY be sent either in an Initialization 
   message at the session establishment time, or in a Capability 
   message dynamically during the lifetime of a session (only if 
   "Dynamic Announcement" capability [RFC5561] has been successfully 
   negotiated with the peer).  

   The format of this capability is as follows:

     LDP Capabilities [RFC5561].         

     Multipoint MT: TLV type (IANA assigned). 

     Length: The length (in octets) of TLV. The value of this field 
     MUST be 1 as there is no Capability-specific data [RFC5561] that 
     follows in the TLV. 

     S-bit: MUST be 1 if used in LDP Initialization message. MAY be 
     set to 0 or 1 in dynamic Capability message to advertise or 
     withdraw the capability respectively.      

   An mLDP speaker that has successfully advertised and negotiated 
   "Multipoint MT" capability MUST support the following: 

  1. Topology-scoped mLDP FECs in LDP messages ( Section 4. ) 

  2. Topology-scoped mLDP forwarding setup ( Section 7. ) 

6. MT Applicability on FEC-based features  

6.1. Typed Wildcard MP FEC Elements 

   RFC5918 extends base LDP and defines Typed Wildcard FEC Element 
   framework [RFC5918]. Typed Wildcard FEC element can be used in any 
   LDP message to specify a wildcard operation/action for given type of 
   FEC. 
    
   The MT extensions proposed in document do not require any extension 
   in procedures for Typed Wildcard Prefix FEC element, and these 
   procedures apply as-is to Multipoint MT FEC wildcarding. The MT 
   extensions, though, allow use of "MT IP" or "MT IPv6" in the Address 
   Family field of the Typed Wildcard FEC element in order to use

   wildcard operations in the context of a given topology. The use of 
   MT-scoped address family also allows us to specify MT-ID in these 
   operations.  
    
   This document extends Typed Wildcard MP FEC element encoding for MT 
   as follows: 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3

               Fig 6: "Typed Wildcard MP FEC Element" for MT 
                                      
   The proposed format allows an LSR to perform wildcard MP FEC 
   operations under the scope of a topology.  

6.2. End-of-LIB 

   [RFC5919] specifies extensions and procedures for an LDP speaker to 
   signal its convergence for given FEC type towards a peer. The 
   procedures defined in [RFC5919] apply as-is to MT MP FEC element. 
   This means that an mLDP speaker MAY signal its mLDP convergence 
   using Typed Wildcard MP FEC element, and its MT mLDP convergence per 
   topology using MT Typed Wildcard MP FEC element (as defined in 
   earlier section). 

7. Topology-Scoped Forwarding   

   Since the MTID is part of the mLDP FEC, there is no need to support 
   the concept of multiple topology tables in mLDP. Each MP LSP will be 
   unique due to the MTID being part of the FEC. There is also no need 
   to have specific Label Forwarding Tables per topology. Each MP LSP 
   will have its own unique local label in the LFT. In order to satisfy 
   the MTR in mLDP, the upstream LSR and downstream forwarding 
   interface procedures must be changed. 

7.1. Upstream LSR selection 

   The procedures as described in draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp-15 section-
   2.4.1.1 depend on the best path to reach the root. When the MTID is 
   signaled as part of the FEC, the MTID is used to select the topology 
 
 
Wijnands, et. al             Expires May 2012                  [Page 8] 
         
Internet-Draft mLDP Extensions for Multi-Topology Routing November 2011 
         

   that must to be used to find the best path to the root address. 
   Using the next-hop from this best path, a LDP peer is selected 
   following the procedures as defined in draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp-15. 

7.2. Downstream forwarding interface 

   The procedures as described in draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp-15 section-
   2.4.1.2 describe how a downstream forwarding interface is selected. 
   In these procedures any interface leading to the downstream LDP 
   neighbor can be considered as candidate forwarding interface. When 
   the MTID is part of the FEC, this is no longer true. An interface 
   must only be selected if it is part of the same topology that was 
   signaled in the mLDP FEC element. Besides this restriction, the 
   other procedures in draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp-15 section-2.4.1.2 
   apply. 

8. Security Considerations 

   This extension to mLDP does not introduce any new security 
   considerations beyond that already apply to the base LDP 
   specification [RFC5036], base mLDP specification [RFC6388], and MPLS 
   security framework [RFC5920]. 

9. IANA Considerations 

  The document introduces following new protocol elements that require 
  IANA consideration and code point assignment: 
 

   o  New LDP Capability TLV: "Multipoint MT Capability" TLV (requested 
      code point: 0x50F from LDP registry "TLV Type Name Space") 

   o  New address families under IANA registry "Address Family 
      Numbers": 

      -  MT IP: Multi-Topology IP version 4 (requested codepoint: 26) 

      -  MT IPv6: Multi-Topology IP version 6 (requested codepoint: 27) 

   o  New registry "LDP Multi-Topology (MT) ID Name Space" under "LDP 
      Parameter" namespace. The registry is defined as: 

     Range/Value    Name 
     -----------    ------------------------ 
     0              Default Topology
