        The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selected
        mailbox.  A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a
        client that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and

        next.  This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes
        with one command, limiting the round-trips and waiting for various
        searches to complete, and not requiring disruption of the currently
        selected mailbox.  This also uses MAILBOX and TAG fields in
        ESEARCH responses, allowing a client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selected
        mailbox.  A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a
        client that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and
        SEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the
        next.  The commands can't be pipelined, because the server might run
        them in parallel, and the untagged SEARCH responses could not then
        be distinguished from each other.
      </t>

      <t>
        This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes
        with one command, and includes MAILBOX and TAG fields in the ESEARCH response,
        yielding the following advantages:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            A single command limits the number of round-trips needed to search
            a set of mailboxes.
          </t>
          <t>
            A single command eliminates the need to wait for one search to complete
            before starting the next.
          </t>
          <t>
            A single command allows the server to optimize the search, if it can.
          </t>
          <t>
            A command that is not dependent upon the selected mailbox eliminates the
            need to disrupt the selection state, or to open another IMAP connection.
          </t>
          <t>
            The MAILBOX and TAG fields in the responses allow a client to distinguish
            which responses go with which search (and which mailbox).
            A client can safely pipeline these search commands without danger of confusion.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

    <section title="Extensions to UID SEARCH command">

        <t hangText="Arguments:">OPTIONAL source options<vspace/>
          OPTIONAL result options<vspace/>
          OPTIONAL charset specification (see <xref target="RFC2978"/>)<vspace/>

          BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid
        </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        This section further updates definition of the UID SEARCH command described in
        section 2.6.1 of <xref target="RFC4466"/>
        (initially described in section 6.4.4 of <xref target="RFC3501"/>
        and extended by <xref target="RFC4731"/>).
      </t>

      <t>
        The UID SEARCH command is extended to allow for optional source and result options.
        This document does not define any new result options
        (see Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC4731"/>).
        A server that supports this extension includes
        <cref anchor="fix-for-pub-1">"X-DRAFT-I03-MMBX" (changes for publication)</cref>
        in its IMAP capability string.        
      </t>

      <section title="The ESEARCH response">
        <t>
          Unless specified otherwise by a description of a result option, in the presence of
          a search source option the server MUST return ESEARCH responses <xref target="RFC4731"/>
          instead of the corresponding SEARCH responses.
          Because message numbers are not useful for mailboxes that are not selected,          
          the responses need information about UIDs, not message numbers.
          Therefore, this extension only applies to UID SEARCH, and trying to specify
          source options on plain SEARCH results in a tagged BAD response.
          This is true even if the source options specify that only the selected mailbox
          be searched.
        </t>

        <t>
          Presence of a source option in absence of a result option implies the "ALL" result
          option (see Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC4731"/>).  Note that this is not the same
          as the result from the SEARCH command described in the IMAP base protocol.
        </t>

        <t>
          Source options describe which mailboxes must be searched for messages.
          A UID SEARCH command with source options does not affect which
          mailbox, if any, is currently selected, regardless of which mailboxes are searched.
        </t>

        <t>
          For each mailbox satisfying the source options, a single ESEARCH response MUST be returned
          if any messages in that mailbox match the search criteria.  An ESEARCH response MUST NOT
          be returned for mailboxes that contain no matching messages.
          This is true even when result options such as MIN, MAX, and COUNT are specified
          (see section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC4731"/>), and the values returned
          (lowest UID matched, highest UID matched, and number of messages matched,
          respectively) apply to the mailbox reported in that ESEARCH response.
        </t>

        <t>
          Note that it is now possible for a UID SEARCH command to return *no* untagged responses
          (no SEARCH nor ESEARCH responses), in the case that there are no matches to the search
          in any of the mailboxes that satisfy the source options.
          Clients can detect this situation by finding the tagged OK response without having
          received any matching untagged ESEARCH responses.
        </t>

        <t>
          Each ESEARCH response MUST contain the MAILBOX, TAG, and UIDVALIDITY correlators.
          Correlators allow clients to issue several UID SEARCH commands at once (pipelined).
          The server MAY perform pipelined searches in parallel; or it MAY instead serialize them.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Source options -- specifying mailboxes to search">
        <t>
          The source options, if present, MUST contain a mailbox specifier as defined in the
          IMAP NOTIFY extension <xref target="RFC5465"/>, section 6 (using the "filter-mailboxes"
          ABNF item), with the following changes:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              The "selected-delayed" specifier is not valid here.
            </t>
            <t>
              A "subtree-one" specifier is added.  The "subtree" specifier results in a search of
              the specified mailbox and all selectable mailboxes that are subordinate to it, through
              an indefinitely deep hierarchy.  The "subtree-one" specifier results in a search of
              the specified mailbox and all selectable child mailboxes, one hierarchy level down.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          If "subtree" is specified, the server MUST defend against loops in the hierarchy
          (for example, those caused by recursive file-system links within the message store).
          The server SHOULD do this by keeping track of the mailboxes that have been searched,
          and terminating the hierarchy traversal when a repeat is found.  If it can not do
          that, it MAY do it by limiting the hierarchy depth.
        </t>

        <t>
          If the source options are not present, the value "selected" is assumed -- that is,
          only the currently selected mailbox is searched.
        </t>

        <t>
          The "personal" source option is a particularly convenient way to search all of
          the current user's mailboxes.
          Note that there is no way to use wildcard characters to search all mailboxes;
          the "mailboxes" source option does not do wildcard expansion.
        </t>

        <t>
          If the source options include (or default to) "selected", the IMAP session MUST be in
          "selected" state.
          If the source options specify other mailboxes and NOT "selected", then the IMAP session
          MUST be in either "selected" or "authenticated" state.
          If the session is not in a correct state, the UID SEARCH command returns a "BAD" result.
        </t>

        <t>
          If the server supports the ACL <xref target="RFC4314"/> extension, then
          the logged in user is required to have the 'r' right for each mailbox
          she wants to search.
          In addition, any mailboxes that are not explicitly named (accessed through "personal"
          or "subtree", for example) are required to have the "l" right.
          Mailboxes matching the source options for which
          the logged in user lacks sufficient rights MUST be ignored by a multimailbox search.
          In particular, ESEARCH responses MUST NOT be returned for those mailboxes.
        </t>

      </t>

      <t>
        There's a suggestion to add an EXCLUDE clause (with a nested search criteria).
        For example, one might want to search "personal" but exclude "mailboxes (Trash Spam)".

        Cyrus suggests you can use metadata to tag mailboxes that you do or don't want to

        NEVER want searched (as Trash and Spam, above)).

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        This extension to the IMAP UID SEARCH command allows a single command to search
        many mailboxes at once.
        On the one hand, a client could do that by sending many IMAP SEARCH commands.
        On the other hand, this makes it easier for a client to overwork a server, by sending a
        single command that results in an expensive search of tens of thousands of mailboxes.
        Server implementations need to be aware of that, and provide mechanisms that prevent
        a client from adversely affecting other users.
        Limitations on the number of mailboxes that may be searched in one command, and/or
        on the server resources that will be devoted to responding to a single client,
        are reasonable limitations for an implementation to impose.
      </t>            
      <t>
        Implementations MUST, of course, apply access controls appropriately, limiting a user's
        access to UID SEARCH in the same way its access is limited for any other IMAP commands.
        This extension has no data-access risks beyond what may be there in the unextended
        IMAP implementation.
