Internet-Draft    IANA Registration for IAX Enumservice    November 2010


1.  Introduction

   The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) [RFC3986] Dynamic
   Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM) [RFC3761]
   transforms E.164 [E164] numbers into DNS names.  Then, using DNS
   services like delegation through NS records and NAPTR records, one
   can look up what services are available for a specific domain name.

   IAX (Inter-Asterisk eXchange) [RFC5456] is an "all in one" protocol
   for handling multimedia in IP networks.  It combines both control and
   media services in the same protocol.  In addition, IAX uses a single
   UDP data stream on a static port greatly simplifying Network Address
   Translation (NAT) gateway traversal, eliminating the need for other
   protocols to work around NAT, and simplifying network and firewall
   management.  IAX employs a compact encoding which decreases bandwidth
   usage and is well suited for Internet telephony service.  In
   addition, its open nature permits new payload types additions needed
   to support additional services.

   This document registers the IAX Enumservice according to the
   guidelines given in RFC3761 [RFC3761].  The IAX Enumservice is used
   in provisioning the services field of a NAPTR resource record.  This
   field indicates what class of functionality a given end point offers.

Internet-Draft    IANA Registration for IAX Enumservice    November 2010


3.  Examples

3.1.  Simple IAX Registration

   The following is an example of the use of the Enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record.

     $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.

     @     IN NAPTR ( 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax"
                  "!^.*$!iax:example.com/chas!" .   )

   This contact information indicates that service identified by the
   "+442079460148" E.164 number can be accessed using the IAX protocol
   to domain 'example.com.'  The called party, service, or program on
   that domain is identified by 'chas'.

3.2.  Registration with Multiple Priorities

   The next example demonstrates that service identified by the
   "+441632960083" E.164 number is preferably accessed by IAX, secondly
   via SIP [RFC3764] , and then H.323 [RFC3762] for voice and general
   commmunication, and lastly by SMTP for messaging.  Note that the
   tokens "iax", "sip", "h323", and "email" are types registered with
   IANA, and they have no implicit connection with the protocols or URI
   schemes with the same names.

   In each case, the next step in the resolution process is to use the
   resolution mechanism appropriate to each of the protocols, (specified
   by the URI schemes iax, sip, and h323).

     $ORIGIN 3.8.0.0.6.9.2.3.6.1.4.4.e164.arpa.

     @    IN NAPTR ( 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax"
                 "!^.*$!iax:example.com/mccarthy!" . )

     @    IN NAPTR ( 10 101 "u" "E2U+SIP"
                 "!^.*$!sip:mccarthy@example.com!" . )

     @    IN NAPTR ( 10 102 "u" "E2U+H323"
                 "!^.*$!h323:mccarthy@example.com!" . )

     @    IN NAPTR ( 10 103 "u" "E2U+email:mailto"
                 "!^.*$!mailto:mccarthy@example.com!" . )

Internet-Draft    IANA Registration for IAX Enumservice    November 2010


3.3.  Registration with an IAX context

   The following is an example of the use of the Enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record that contains a
   destination 'context'.

     $ORIGIN 9.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.

     @     IN NAPTR ( 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax"
                  "!^.*$!iax:example.com/joe?developers!" )

   This contact information indicates that the domain
   9.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa. may be contacted by using the IAX
   protocol at domain 'example.com' with the called party 'joe' in the
   context (or user partition) 'developers'.  See Section Section 2 of
   [RFC5456].

3.4.  IPv6 Registration

   The following is an example of the use of the Enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record that contains an IPV6
   destination address.

   $ORIGIN 9.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.

   @     IN NAPTR ( 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax"
                  "!^.*$!iax:[2001:db8::1]:4569/alice?friends!"  . )

   This contact information indicates that the domain
   9.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa. may be contacted by using the IAX
   protocol at IPv6 address [2001:db8::1], port 4569 with the called
   party 'alice' in the context (or user partition) 'friends'.


4.  Security Considerations

   The IAX Enumservice does not introduce any new security issues beyond
   any already present in the ENUM, DNS and IAX protocols except that
   this Enumservice provides for disclosure of information that may
   facilitate an attack or a violation of user privacy in some way.  The
   primary result of these exploits is unwanted communications.  These
   issues are discussed in further detail in RFC 4035 [RFC4035] and RFC
   3833 [RFC3833].

   The use of DNSSEC [RFC4035] is recommended to improve operational
   security.

Internet-Draft    IANA Registration for IAX Enumservice    November 2010


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests registration of the "iax" Enumservice with the
   'iax' sub-type according to the guidelines and specifications in RFC
   3761bis [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide] and the definitions in
   Section 2 in this document.


6.  DNS Considerations

   DNS considerations related to the IAX Enumservice are similar to
   those of the SIP enumservice.

   Since IAX is typically deployed in a proxy configuration,
   misconfiguration or delays in zone changes can result in call loops,
   perhaps with different protocols or networks.  Implementations should
   take care to ensure such loops can be detected without interrupting
   other services including SIP-based, IAX-based, and DNS itself.
   [RFC4759] provides an example of a loop mitigation mechanism.
