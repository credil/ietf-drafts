Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced requirements         July 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document defines Advanced IPv6 features for a residential or
   small office router referred to as an IPv6 CE router.  Typically
   these routers also support IPv4.  The IPv6 End-user Network
   Architecture for such a router is described in
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router].  This version of the document
   completes the organization of Advanced features between General, WAN,
   and LAN requirements.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   End-user Network          one or more links attached to the IPv6 CE
                             router that connect IPv6 hosts.

   IPv6 Customer Edge router a node intended for home or small office
                             use which forwards IPv6 packets not
                             explicitly addressed to itself.  The IPv6
                             CE router connects the end-user network to
                             a service provider network.

   IPv6 host                 any device implementing an IPv6 stack
                             receiving IPv6 connectivity through the
                             IPv6 CE router

   LAN interface             an IPv6 CE router's attachment to a link in
                             the end-user network.  Examples are
                             Ethernets (simple or bridged), 802.11
                             wireless or other LAN technologies.  An
                             IPv6 CE router may have one or more network
                             layer LAN Interfaces.

   Service Provider          an entity that provides access to the
                             Internet.  In this document, a Service
                             Provider specifically offers Internet
                             access using IPv6, and may also offer IPv4
                             Internet access.  The Service Provider can
                             provide such access over a variety of
                             different transport methods such as DSL,
                             cable, wireless, and others.

Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced requirements         July 2010


   WAN interface             an IPv6 CE router's attachment to a link
                             used to provide connectivity to the Service
                             Provider network; example link technologies
                             include Ethernets (simple or bridged), PPP
                             links, Frame Relay, or ATM networks as well
                             as Internet-layer (or higher-layer)
                             "tunnels", such as tunnels over IPv4 or
                             IPv6 itself.


3.  Conceptual Configuration Variables

   The CE Router maintains such a list of conceptual optional
   configuration variables.

   1.  Enable RIPng ([RFC2080]) on the LAN.

   2.  Softwire enable.

   3.  More Specifc Route ([RFC4191]) enable and configure routes.

   4.  If DHCPv6 fails, the CE Router may initiate PPPOE, a Softwire
       tunnel, or 6to4 [RFC3056], or 6rd [I-D.ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd]
       operation.

   5.  Change ULA on the device.


4.  Requirements

4.1.  General Requirements

   Quality of Service:

   Q-1:  The CPE router MAY support differentiated services [RFC2474].

   DNS:

   D-1:  For local DNS queries for configuration, the CE Router may
         include a DNS server to handle local queries.  Non-local
         queries can be forwarded unchanged to a DNS server specified in
         the DNS server DHCPv6 option.  The CE Router may also include
         DNS64 functionality which is specified in
         [I-D.bagnulo-behave-dns64].

Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced requirements         July 2010


   D-2:  The local DNS server MAY also handle renumbering from the
         Service Provider provided prefix for local names used
         exclusively inside the home (the local AAAA and PTR records are
         updated).  This capability provides connectivity using local
         DNS names in the home after a Service Provider renumbering.  A
         CE Router MAY add local DNS entries based on dynamic requests
         from the LAN segment(s).  The protocol to carry such requests
         from hosts to the CE Router is yet to be described.

   The CE Router MAY support manual configuration via the web using a
   URL string like http://router.local as per multicast DNS (mDNS).
   Zero-configuration is vendor-dependent.

   G-1:  TODO if any.

4.2.  WAN Side Configuration

   The IPv6 CE router will need to support connectivity to one or more
   access network architectures.  This document describes an IPv6 CE
   router that is not specific to any particular architecture or Service
   Provider, and supports all commonly used architectures.

   WAN side requirements:

   W-1:  The CE Router WAN interface MUST support a B4 Interface as
         specified in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

   W-2:  The CE Router WAN interface MUST support at least one 6rd
         Virtual Interface as specified in [I-D.ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd].

   W-3:  The CE Router MUST support an IPv6 firewall feature.

   DHCPV6 requirements:

   WD-1:  The CE Router MUST use a persistent DUID ([RFC3315]) for
          DHCPv6 messages.  The DUID MUST NOT change between network
          interface reset or CE Router reset.

   Multicast requirements:

   WM-1:  Consistent with [RFC4605], the CE router MUST NOT implement
          the router portion of MLDv2 for the WAN interface.

   WM-2:  Multicast data MUST NOT be sent on any softwire tunnel
          operating on the CE Router with transition technologies like
          DS-Lite as specified in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

   Prefix Delegation requirements:

Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced requirements         July 2010


   WPD-1:  The CE Router is a requesting router and follows [RFC3633]
           for acquiring a delegated prefix from the Service Provider.

   Manageability requirements:

   WPD-1:  TODO.

4.3.  LAN Side Configuration

   Prefix Sub-Delegation requirements:

   LPD-1:  The LAN interface(s) are sub-delegated prefixes subnetted
           from the delegated prefix acquired by the WAN interface.  The
           CE Router MUST support hierarchical prefix delegation for
           automatic sub-delegation in the LAN.  Any other automated
           prefix sub-delegation is vendor dependent.

   CPE Router Behavior in a routed network:

   R-1:  One example of the CPE Router use in the home is shown below.
         The home has a broadband modem combined with a CPE Router, all
         in one device.  The LAN interface of the device is connected to
         another standalone CPE Router that supports a wireless access
         point.  To support such a network, this document recommends
         using prefix sub-delegation of the prefix obtained either via
         IA_PD from WAN interface or a ULA from the LAN interface .  The
         network interface of the downstream router may obtain an IA_PD
         via stateful DHCPv6.  If the CPE router supports the routed
         network through automatic prefix sub-delegation, the CPE router
         MUST support a DHCPv6 server or DHCPv6 relay agent.  Further,
         if an IA_PD is used, the Service Provider or user MUST allocate
         an IA_PD or ULA prefix short enough to be sub-delegated and
         subsequently used for SLAAC.  Therefore, a prefix length
         shorter than /64 is needed.  The CPE Router MAY support RIPng
         in the home network.

Internet-Draft    IPv6 CE router Advanced requirements         July 2010


   R-2:  The CE Router MAY support [RFC4191] on its LAN interfaces.
         Small consumer embedded multi-homed hosts in the home may not
         have configurable routing tables.  The CE Router can
         communicate More Specific Routes (MSRs) to these hosts to allow
         them to choose a preferred router to send traffic to for
         traffic destined to specific prefixes configured through manual
         configuration.  Advertisement of MSRs through RAs is turned off
         by default.

   Multicast Behavior:

   LM-1:  The CPE Router MUST follow the model described for MLD Proxy
          in [RFC4605] to implement multicast.

   LM-2:  Consistent with [RFC4605], the LAN interfaces on the CPE
          router MUST NOT implement an MLDv2 Multicast Listener.

   LM-3:  If the CPE Router hardware includes a network bridge between
          the WAN interface and the LAN interface(s), then the CPE
          Router MUST support MLDv2 snooping as per [RFC4541].

   ND Proxy requirements:

   LNDP-1:  If the CE Router has only one /64 prefix to be used across
            multiple LAN interfaces and the CE Router supports any two
            LAN interfaces that cannot bridge data between them because
            the two interfaces have disparate MAC layers, then the CE
            Router MUST support Proxying Neighbor Advertisements as
            specified in Section 7.2.8 of [RFC4861].  If any two LAN
            interfaces support bridging between the interfaces, then
            Proxying Neighbor Advertisements is not necessary between
            the two interfaces.  Legacy 3GPP networks have the following
            requirements:

            1.  No DHCPv6 prefix is delegated to the CE Router.

            2.  Only one /64 is available on the WAN link.

            3.  The link types between the WAN interface and LAN
                interface(s) are disparate and, therefore, can't be
                bridged.

            4.  No NAT66 is to be used.

            5.  Each LAN interface needs global connectivity.

            6.  Uses SLAAC to configure LAN interface addresses.

            For these legacy 3GPP networks, the CPE Router MUST support
            ND Proxy between the WAN and LAN interface(s).  If a CE
            Router will never be deployed in an environment with these
            characteristics, then ND Proxy is not necessary.

4.4.  Security Considerations

   Security requirements:

   S-1:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD support
