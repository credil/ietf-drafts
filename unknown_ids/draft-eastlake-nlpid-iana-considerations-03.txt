INTERNET-DRAFT                            IANA Considerations for NLPIDs


1. Introduction

   Some protocols being developed or extended by the IETF make use of
   the ISO/IEC (International Organization for Standardization /
   International Electrotechnical Commission) Network Layer Protocol
   Identifier (NLPID).

   The term "NLPID" is not actually used in [ISO9577], which refers to
   one octet IPIs (Initial Protocol Identifiers) and SPIs (Subsequent
   Protocol Identifiers). While these are two logically separate kinds
   of one octet identifiers, most values are usable as both an IPI and
   an SPI. In the remainder of this document, the term NLPID is used for
   these values.

   This document provides NLPID IANA Considerations.

   [RFC5226] is incorporated herein except to the extent that there are
   contrary provisions in this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. NLPIDs

   [ISO9577] defines one octet network layer protocol identifiers that
   are commonly called NLPIDs, which is the term used in this document.
   The registry of NLPID values is maintained by ISO/IEC by updating
   that document.

   NLPIDs are used in a number of protocols. For example, in the
   mar$pro.type field of the multicast address resolution server
   protocol [RFC2022], the ar$pro.type field of the NBMA (Non-Broadcast
   Multi-Access) next hop resolution protocol [RFC2332] and in the IS-IS
   Protocols Supported TLV [RFC1195]. See Appendix B.



2.1 Sub-ranges of the NLPID

   Sub-ranges of the possible NLPID values are categorized by [ISO9577]
   for organizations as shown below, primarily for the ISO/IEC
   (International Organization for Standardization / International
   Electrotechnical Commission) and the ITU-T (International
   Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector):

      Code Point  Category
      ----------  --------
      0x00        ISO/IEC
      0x01-0x0F   ITU-T
      0x10-0x3F   ITU-T Rec. X.25 and ISO/IEC 8208
      0x40-0x43   ISO/IEC
      0x44        ITU-T
      0x45-0x4F   ISO/IEC
      0x50-0x6F   ITU-T Rec. X.25 and ISO/IEC 8208
      0x70-0x7F   Joint ITU-T and ISO/IEC
      0x80        ISO/IEC (see Section 2.2)
      0x81-0x8F   ISO/IEC
      0x90-0xAF   ITU-T Rec. X.25 and ISO/IEC 8208
      0xB0-0xBF   ITU-T
      0xC0-0xCF   Potentially available for IANA (see Section 2.3)
      0xD0-0xEF   ITU-T Rec. X.25 and ISO/IEC 8208
      0xF0-0xFE   Joint ITU-T and ISO/IEC
      0xFF        Reserved for an Extension mechanism to be
                  jointly developed by ITU-T and ISO/IEC



2.2 Code Point 0x80

   NLPID 0x80 is known as the IEEE (Institute of Electrical &
   Electronics Engineers) SNAP (SubNetwork Access Protocol) code point.
   It is followed by five octets, using the IEEE SNAP SAP (Service


D. Eastlake                                                     [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT                            IANA Considerations for NLPIDs


   Access Point) conventions, to specify the protocol. Those conventions
   are described in Section 3 of [RFC5342].  In particular, it is valid
   for such a five-octet sequence to start with the IANA OUI
   (Organizationally Unique Identifier) followed by two further octets
   assigned by IANA as provided in [RFC5342]. The same IANA registry is
   used for such protocol identifiers whether they are planned to be
   introduced by the 0x80 NLPID or the IEEE SNAP SAP LSAPs (Link-Layer
   Subnet Access Points) (0xAAAA). Values allocated by IANA may be used
   in either context as appropriate.

   Because of the limited number of NLPID code points available for IANA
   allocation, use of the IEEE SNAP NLPID is RECOMMENDED rather than
   allocation of a new single octet NLPID code point.



2.3 NLPIDs Available for IANA Allocation

   A limited number of code points are available that could be allocated
   by IANA under [ISO9577]. Because of this, it is desirable, where
   practical, to use code point 0x80, as discussed in Section 2.2 above,
   or to get code points allocated from the ranges categorized to other
   organizations. For example, code point 0x8E was allocated for IPv6
   [RFC2460], although it is in a range of code points categorized for
   ISO/IEC.

   The table below, which includes two new code point allocations made
   by this document, shows those still available.

      Code Point  Status
      ----------  --------
      0xC0        TRILL [TRILL]
      0xC1        IEEE 802.1aq [802.1aq]
      0xC2-0xCB   Available
      0xCC        IPv4 [RFC791]
      0xCD-0xCE   Available
      0xCF        PPP [RFC1661]

3. IANA Considerations

   As long as code points are available, IANA will allocate additional
   values when required by an IETF Standards Action.

   Whenever it allocates an NLPID, IANA will inform the IETF liaison to
   ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6 (Joint Technical Committee 1, Study Committee 6)
   [JTC1SC6], or if IANA is unable to determine that IETF liaison, the
   IAB.  The liaison (or the IAB) will then assure that ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6
   is informed so that [ISO9577] can be updated since ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6
   is the body that maintains [ISO9577]. To simplify this process, it is
   desirable to maintain an IETF Liaison to ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6.

   This document allocates the code points 0xC0 and 0xC1 as shown in
   Section 2.3 and IANA shall request the liaison (or the IAB) to so
   inform ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6.

   IANA will maintain a web page showing NLPIDs that have been allocated
   to a protocol being developed or extended by the IETF or are
   otherwise of interest. The initial state of the web page shall be as
   shown in Appendix A. IANA will update this web page for (1) NLPIDs
   allocated by IANA and (2) other allocations or de-allocations when
   IANA is requested to make such changes in this web page by the IETF
   liaison mentioned above.



4. Security Considerations

   This document is concerned with allocation of NLPIDs. It is not
   directly concerned with security.

   Note: According to [RFC1707], NLPID 0x70 was assigned to IPv7. That
   assignment appears to no longer be in effect as it is not listed in
   ISO/IEC 9577. IPv7 was itself a temporary code point assignment made
   while a decision was being made between three candidates for the next
   generation of IP after IPv4. Those candidates were assigned IPv6,
   IPv7, and IPv8. IPv6 was selected.

   should be replaced with the RFC number assigned to this document and
   this paragraph deleted before publication.
