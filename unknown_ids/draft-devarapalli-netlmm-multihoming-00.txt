Abstract

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 enables network-based mobility for a regular IPv6
   mobile node with no mobility management protocol.  It makes it appear
   to the mobile node that its IP address does not change as the mobile
   node moves across the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  There have been some
   issues identified with supporting a host with multiple interfaces
   attaching to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  This document describes
   and analyzes some of the scenarios associated with this.

1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [2] provides network-based mobility for a regular
   IPv6 mobile node with no mobility management protocol.  It is quite
   straight forward to provide mobility for a mobile node with one
   interface.  There have been some issues identified with supporting a
   host with multiple interfaces attaching to the Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain.  The multiple interfaces could be of the same or different
   access technology types.  The mobile node may handoff sessions from
   one interface to another.

   The mobile node may be a regular IPv6 host which cannot handle the
   same prefix across two different interfaces.  Some mobile nodes have
   multi-homing support in the sense that they can connect to the same
   subnet via two interfaces.

   This document analyzes three different scenarios with respect to a
   mobile node with multiple interfaces attaching to a PMIPv6 domain.

   o  Assigning a unique prefix per interface of the mobile node.
   o  Assigning the same prefix across interfaces but a unique address
      per interface.
   o  Shared one address across interfaces.

   In all three scenarios the mobile node is able to use the multiple
   interfaces simultaneously to send and receive packets.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].


3.  Multiple Interface Scenarios

   Three different scenarios are considered in this document.  The
   following sections describe and analyze the three scenarios.

3.1.  Unique Prefix per Interface

   In this scenario, each interface on the mobile node is assigned a
   unique prefix.  The LMA maintains multiple binding cache entries, one
   entry per interface on the mobile node.  The binding cache entries
   may contain the Layer 2 interface identifier and the access
   technology type of the corresponding interface on the mobile node.
   The LMA also maintains two separate routes for prefix1 and prefix2.

                   Figure 1: Unique Prefix per Interface

   The mobile node is able to use both interfaces simultaneously for
   sending and receiving packets.  Since the LMA maintains separate
   route entries for prefix1 and prefix2, it encapsulates and forwards
   the packets via the appropriate MAG.

   When the mobile node moves and attaches to another MAG in the same
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, session continuity is maintained by
   assigning the same prefix to the interface.  If the mobile node moves
   and attaches to MAG3 with if1, the MAG3 sends a Proxy BU message to
   the LMA with the access technology type and interface identifier of
   if1.  The LMA checks if there is an existing binding cache entry for
   the mobile node for if1.  If there is an existing binding cache
   entry, the LMA assigns the same prefix previously assigned and
   responds to MAG3.

   If there is no L2 interface identifier that MAG3 could identify for
   if1 and did not include the interface identifier in the proxy BU,
   then the LMA does not know if this is a handover for if1 or if the
   mobile node is attaching via a new interface to MAG3.  The LMA's
   decision is then based on what the Handover Indication field in the
   Access Technology Type option is set to.  If MAG3 knows that the
   mobile node was attached to another MAG in the same PMIPv6 domain
   using if1, then it must indicate to the LMA that it is a handover.
   This would ensure that the mobile node sees the same prefix for if1.
   Otherwise the mobile node ends up with a new prefix for if1.

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [2] does not specify any
   mechanism for MAG3 to figure out if the mobile node is performing a
   handover for if1 or if it is attaching to the Proxy Mobile IPv6
   domain for the first time via if1.  One option is for MAG3 to obtain
   this information via context transfer from MAG1.  This solution
   requires a context transfer interface between MAG1 and MAG3.  Another
   option is for MAG3 to be told by the AAA infrastructure as part of
   access authentication that the mobile node was previously attached to
   the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain via if1.  However, this solution may not
   work in case the AAA infrastructure does not store interface related
   information or if the AAA infrastructure is not being used.  One
   solution that may work in most cases is for the mobile node to
   indicate to MAG3 that it already has sessions on top of the prefix
   assigned to if1 and it is performing a handover.  The mobile node
   conveys this information as part of Layer 2 setup.  When MAG3 gets
   this information, it sets the Handover Indication field in the Access
   Technology Type option to indicate a handover for if1.

3.1.1.  Inter-Access Technology Handovers

   This section considers a handover scenario where the mobile node
   performs a handover between interfaces that belong to different
   access technologies.

   The mobile node is initially attached to the PMIPv6 domain via MAG1
   using if1 as show in Figure 2.

   The mobile node moves and attaches to the same PMIPv6 domain via MAG2
   using if2.  The mobile node may not have connectivity on if1 anymore.
   The LMA assigns the same prefix for if2 and updates its binding cache
   entry.  This is illustrated in Figure 3.

              Figure 3: Mobile Node Performs Handover to if2

   For the above inter-access technology handover to work, the LMA must
   know that this is a handover involving two different interfaces of
   the mobile node.  The Interface Identifier option if present in the
   proxy BU from MAG2 will have a different identifier from what is
   stored in the binding cache entry on the LMA.  The Proxy BU from MAG2
   must have the Handover Indication field in the Access Technology Type
   option set to "2" or "3" to indicate that it is a handover.  See
   Section 3.1 for a detailed description of how MAG2 determines when to
   indicate in the Proxy BU that it is a handover.

   The mobile node must also be able to move the prefix from if1 to if2
   during the handover for the inter-access technology handover to work.
   A regular IPv6 mobile node, with no multi-homing support, may get
   confused if it sees the same prefix over two different interfaces.

3.1.2.  Mobile node with three or more interfaces

   This section considers a handover scenario for a mobile node with
   three or more interfaces and performing a handover from if1 to if3
   while staying connected over if2.  It is assumed that the mobile node
   is attached to MAG1 using if1, MAG2 using if2 and MAG3 using if3.  In



Devarapalli, et al.       Expires May 14, 2008                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             PMIPv6 Multihoming              November 2007


   this scenario, even if MAG3 knows that it is a handover, it does not
   which two interfaces are involved in the handover.  The AAA
   infrastructure does not help here since the AAA does not know which
   interface is being handed off to which one.  The only possible
   solution here is for the mobile node to tell MAG3 more information
   about if1 or the home network prefix assigned to if1 or information
   about MAG1.  MAG3 may indicate in the proxy BU information about if1
   or the prefix assigned to if1 in the proxy BU sent to the LMA.  The
   LMA uses this information to assign the prefix that was assigned to
   if1 to if3 also.  In case the mobile node provides information about
   MAG1, then MAG3 can contact MAG1 over a context transfer interface
   and obtain more information about if1 or the home network prefix
   assigned to if1.  In all cases, MAG3 indicates that it is a handover
   in the proxy BU.

3.2.  Unique Address per Interface

   In this scenario, the mobile node is assigned the same prefix across
   multiple interfaces, but with a unique address per interface.  The
   LMA maintains separate binding cache entries per address of the
   mobile node.  The LMA may also maintain a single binding cache entry,
   but must have separate host route entries per address assigned to the
   mobile node.  This scenario illustrated in Figure 4 creates a multi-
   homing scenario where the mobile node has connectivity via two
   interfaces to the same subnet.

   The mobile node is able to use both interfaces simultaneously for
   sending and receiving packets.  Since the LMA maintains separate host
   route entries for addr1 and addr2, it encapsulates and forwards the
   packets via the appropriate MAG.

   This scenario however creates a multi-link subnet since the same
   prefix is advertised over two different point-to-point links.
   Neighbor discovery is not run across the two point-to-point links
   even though the same prefix is used across the links.  Please refer
   to [4] for more information on issues regarding multi-link subnets.

3.3.  Shared Address across Interfaces

   In this scenario, the mobile node is assigned the same address across
   multiple interfaces.  This scenario enables a mobile node to use
   different links, but make only one IP address visible to the
   applications.  The mobile node can send and receive packets for one
   particular application flow over if1 and for another application flow
   over if2.  This scenario also enables a mobile node to combine two
   low bandwidth links into a high bandwidth link.  Figure 5 illustrates
   this scenario.

          +------//--------\\----------+

              +------[MN]------+


                Figure 5: Shared Address across Interfaces

   The LMA maintains only one binding cache entry per mobile node in
   this scenario.  However, the LMA maintains flow filters that indicate
   routing to a particular MAG.  For example, lets assume that the
   mobile node has two separate flows, flow1 and flow2 and wants to run



Devarapalli, et al.       Expires May 14, 2008                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             PMIPv6 Multihoming              November 2007


   flow1 over if1 and flow2 over if2.  When the LMA receives a packet
   for the mobile node, it checks the flow filters stored in the binding
   cache entry.  If the packets match filter1, the LMA knows that the
   packets must be tunneled to MAG1.

   For this scenario to work, the mobile node must be able to indicate
   to the attached MAG which flows are being bound to a particular MAG.
   The MAG, in turn must include the flow information in the proxy BU
   sent to the LMA.  The LMA processes this Proxy BU and creates a
   filter based on the flow information.  The flow filters may be stored
   in the binding cache entry for the mobile node.  See [3] for more
   information on carrying flow filters in the proxy binding update.

   More description TBD.

   domain.  It does not introduce any new security concerns on top of
   what is described in the Security Considerations section of [2].
