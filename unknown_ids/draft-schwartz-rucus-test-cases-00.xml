    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>As part of the ongoing work to qualify the unwanted communication
	  threat there is a need to document potential approaches being tried
	  throughout the industry. This draft is meant to serve as a repository
	  for these approaches and is intended for informative puroposes only.

       <section title="Test Case 1: Use of draft-wing-sipping-spam-score-02">
         <t><xref target="I-D.wing-sipping-spam-score">
	     </xref> defines a mechanism for SIP proxies to communicate a
         spam score to downstream SIP proxies and to SIP user agents.  This 
	     test case discusses a test setup making use of some parts of this 
	     spam score draft. To recap, it is desirable for SIP proxies to insert 
	     a spam score so that downstream SIP proxies and downstream SIP user 
	     agents can use a high score to decide that special handling is required.</t>
	  
	     <section title="Test Architecture">
		   <t>The architecture chosen for this test is quite simple and involves 
		   an upstream Spam-Score generation server, a downstream receiving SBC 
		   and further downstream destinations (both primary and alternate). 
		   The idea is to generate the score and have the SBC behave differently 
		   depending on both the presence of a score as well as the actual score.</t>

		   <section title="Use Cases">
			   <t>The test consists of five basic scenarios or use cases. For all 
			   cases the assumption is that the variable &rsquo;X&rsquo; marks the upper limit 
			   of a whitelist indication and that the variable &rsquo;Y&rsquo; marks the upper 
			   limit of a graylist indication.</t>
			
			   <section title="No Spam Score is generated">
				   <t>This is a baseline of sorts and is there to test one of two 
				   possible outcomes; message dropped and message allowed through, 
				   nonetheless.</t>
			   </section>
			
			   <section title="&rsquo;Whitelist&rsquo; score from &rsquo;trusted&rsquo; upstream server">
				   <t>This test has the upstream server generate a &rsquo;whitelist&rsquo; score 
				   (0 &lt;= score &lt; X) and the assumption is that there is a trust 
				   relationship between the upstream server and the receiving UAS.</t>
			   </section>

			   <section title="&rsquo;Whitelist&rsquo; score from &rsquo;un-trusted&rsquo; upstream server">
				   <t>This test has the upstream server generate a &rsquo;whitelist&rsquo; score 
				   (0 &lt;= score &lt; X) and the assumption is that there is no trust 
				   relationship between the upstream server and the receiving UAS.</t>
			   </section>

			   <section title="&rsquo;Graylist&rsquo; score from upstream server">
				   <t>This test has the upstream server generate a &rsquo;graylist&rsquo; score 
				   (X &lt;= score &lt; Y) and the assumption is that there is a trust 
				   relationship between the upstream server and the receiving UAS.</t>
			   </section>

			   <section title="&rsquo;Blacklist&rsquo; score from upstream server">
				   <t>This test has the upstream server generate a &rsquo;blacklist&rsquo; score 
				   (Y &lt;= score &lt; 100) and the assumption is that there is a trust 
				   relationship between the upstream server and the receiving UAS.</t>
			   </section>

		   <section title="Test Configurations">
			   <t>For each of the use cases listed above we would like to test the 
			   following configurations</t>
			
			   <section title="Allow All">
				   <t>In this configuration all calls are allowed to proceed downstream 
				   unhindered regardless of both the presence of a score header or the 
				   value therein.</t>
			   </section>
			
			   <section title="Allow all containing a SPAM header">
				   <t>In this configuration all calls are allowed to proceed downstream 
				   unhindered ONLY if they contain a score header REGARDLESS of the value 
				   contained therein.</t>
			   </section>

			   <section title="Allow with no score header or header with specific score">
				   <t>In this configuration all calls are allowed to proceed downstream 
				   unhindered with no score header. If a header exists, however, the 
				   following behavior is followed:</t>
			
				   <section title="&rsquo;Whitelist&rsquo; score">
					   <t>Route to Primary destination.</t>
				   </section>
				
				   <section title="&rsquo;Graylist&rsquo; score">
					   <t>Route to Secondary destination.</t>
				   </section>
			   </section>				   

			   <section title="Allow only with score header or header with specific score">
				   <t>In this configuration all calls are allowed to proceed downstream 
				   unhindered ONLY in presence of score header and than only as per the 
				   following behavior:</t>
			
				   <section title="&rsquo;Whitelist&rsquo; score">
				     	<t>Route to Primary destination.</t>
				   </section>
				
				   <section title="&rsquo;Graylist&rsquo; score">

			   <section title="&rsquo;Y&rsquo; Upper limit of the &rsquo;graylist&rsquo; range">
