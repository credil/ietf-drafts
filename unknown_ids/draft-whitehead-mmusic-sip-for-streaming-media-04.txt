Internet-Draft    media playback protocol requirements          May 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the requirements for a media control protocol
   distinct from the session control protocol for Content on demand
   media streams.

   Historically media stream delivery has been controlled by RTSP as
   both the session set up protocol as well as the media control
   protocol.  RTSP [RFC2326] and its successor [RFC2326bis] define
   semantics for both session setup as well as media control, with
   commands like pause, Rewind etc.

   Similarly SIP has been the protocol of choice for end to end session
   establishment and rendezvous [RFC3261].  These functionalities in the
   context of conversational services has been the main raison d'etre
   and forte of SIP.

   There exist environments, circumstances and use cases where it is
   desirable to use SIP for session establishment and rendezvous, while
   retaining RTSP's capabilities for media and play back control.  Such
   circumstances are increasing in number given that user agents with
   wide ranging capabilities are become much more common in deployments.
   Good Integration with existing RTSP deployments is also desirable
   under these conditions.

   Section 3 describes some use cases that motivate this work.

   Section 4 lays out the requirements for a media control protocol,
   ideally some form of lightweight RTSP without its session
   establishment semantics, that can be used with a session
   establishment and rendezvous protocol.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Use Case Scenarios

   The scope of scenarios for this document includes applications with
   the following characteristics: content-on-demand, streaming media,
   unicast-media streams, live or recorded content, ubiquitous access
   (any-device, any-access).




Whitehead, et al.       Expires November 8, 2008                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft    media playback protocol requirements          May 2008


   While of interest, non-streaming media applications, such as
   downloaded media services, are outside the scope of this document.

3.1.  Characteristics

   For the purposes of this document, the term 'controlled streaming
   media application' represents a class of applications with the
   following characteristics:
   o  Multiple servers that can be a source of content but showing up as
      a single muxed stream at the client.
   o  One or more clients can receive the content.
   o  The media stream(s) needs to be delivered isochronously, in the
      most common case: the client intends to begin rendering the media
      before delivery is complete.
   o  Less common but equally valid, the server does not have resources
      to buffer content until the client is ready to receive it, e.g., a
      live feed.
   o  A session exists between source (e.g. server or peer) and
      destination (e.g. client or peer).
   o  The session is established, managed, and terminated through the
      use of a signaling protocol, in which control messages are
      exchanged (either directly or indirectly) between the source and
      the destination referred to as 'session signaling'.
   o  The application supports media stream control.  The client(s), or
      a proxy element acting on behalf of the client(s), has the ability
      to manipulate the media stream (or other aspect of the
      application) via signaling.  This is referred to as media control
      signaling (or application signaling ).

3.2.  Use Case Descriptions

   As IP-based broadband data services have continued to develop and
   expand, opportunities for streaming media applications have also
   proliferated and expanded beyond the traditional framework.  This
   section describes several streaming media application use case
   scenarios.  These scenarios illustrate the variety of conditions and
   environments in which streaming media applications need to operate.

   Use cases are used with the purpose of clarifying the 'streaming
   media application' and to explore the application space.  The
   objectives are to:
   o  Clarify the frame / scope the discussion.
   o  Illustrate some of usage scenarios.
   o  Identify some of the key attributes that characterize these use
      cases.

3.3.  Server Control of Streaming Session

   During a streaming session, the operator may want to redirect or move
   pending sessions in order to for e.g., upgrade the server.
   Therefore, the server will initiate a session redirect.  Another use
   case of Server control operation is when the server decides to
   initiate a session to the user, based on user preconfigured-settings
   (e.g. reminders).  Further, sessions that are indefinitely paused by
   the client need to be terminated and server resources reclaimed at
   the operators discretion.  This would also be true for sessions where
   the client may have become unresponsive.

3.4.  Remote Access to Private/Firewalled Video Content

   In this use case, the user, while not on his home network, wants to
   access content that is stored on his personal or home network, e.g.,
   a pre-recorded show on a PVR device, or a monitoring camera at his or
   her home location that is capable of providing a live feed as well as
   record it locally as a PVR asset.

   In the case of a live monitoring camera in a home network, the user
   wishes to transition from watching a live stream of the feed to being
   able to move backwards and forwards using media control commands on
   the stored content of the monitoring device.  This translates
   logically to transitioning from watching live TV programming to Time
   shifted TV or PVR type of viewing.  Being able to do it in the
   context of the same session is desirable.

   In the case of a home network based PVR, it is more than likely that
   the home gateway is not set up to be an inbound device for various
   session setup requests to enable the external client to traverse the
   protocol unaware IP NAT device commonly found at the edge of home
   networks.

   In both these cases, the video server is behind a firewall.  In the
   first case, the transition from one mode (live feed) to another
   (COD), would entail multiple messages for staying within a session.
   Also, the client being exterior to the firewall, needs to establish a
   TCP connection from "out" to "in".  RTSP as in stands currently does
   not deal with these adequately.  A rendezvous capable protocol like
   SIP could provide this in addition to client identity and location.

3.5.  VOD services that requires resource or QOS-guarantees

   Consider a Video on Demand (stored video) service provided as a
   unicast session to an end user device from a server.  The user
   requests a VOD movie.  If the operator uses a network proxy to
   request and guarentee QoS for the delivery of the movie from the



Whitehead, et al.       Expires November 8, 2008                [Page 5]

   server to the client, currently RTSP does not provide the means of
   guarenteeing that all subsequent messages that form part of the RTSP
   session will go through the network proxy that manages the QoS.  In
   this particular use case, an end to end session setup and management
   protocol would be helpful.

3.6.  Intelligent selection of media encoding

   A user orders content to be delivered to its current device.  The
   content could exist in different format (e.g. standard definition or
   high definition) or encoding (e.g.  MPEG2, MPEG4, ...).  In addition
   the device can be located behing different types of access networks,
   which implies bandwidth constraints.  The selection of media encoding
   can be adjusted to accomodate these multiple characteristics.

3.7.  Voice/video mailbox

   The control of the server may be extended to a voice/video mailbox
   system.  In addition to controlling the playing of the messages and
   fast forward or rewind similar to content on demand with a couple of
   additional commands to delete or save messages it is possible o have
   access to a mailbox system.  THe mailbox may be located in the home
   or in the network accessed from the home.  If the mailbox is at home
   then it is possible to remotely access to the messages.

3.8.  Motion Detection

   Motion-detecting or pattern-matching cameras may need to call a human
   when motion/pattern is detected and may also have a buffer, which
   allow the human to place pause/rewind commands.

3.9.  Video Subscriptions

   A user subscribes on a webpage to get all new local high-school
   football games, or Voipsa blue-box podcasts.  He wants his DVR/TV to
   pop up with the option to play them immediately, or record them to
   DVR, or neither.  The high-school football game is not available from
   cable TV, so the DVR doesn't have a schedule to know when to get it
   by itself.  Of course this could be done with an off-line indication,
   such as email, but it would be nice if his DVR didn't need to support
   email.


4.  Requirements

   This section outlines the key requirements that need to be satisfied
   in order to have a media control protocol acting as a control stream
   within a multimedia session.



Whitehead, et al.       Expires November 8, 2008                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    media playback protocol requirements          May 2008


   REQ-1  The media control protocol must support commands such as play,
          pause, rewind, forward, fast rewind, fast forward, slow
          rewind, and slow forward.

   REQ-2  It must be possible to negotiate the media control protocol of
          a media stream.

   REQ-3  If the media control protocol does not apply to all media
          streams of a given session, it must be possible to indicate
          the specific media streams that are under the scope of the
          trick-play control protocol.

   REQ-4  The media control protocol must allow for asynchronous media
          event notifications (e.g.: end-of-stream)".

   REQ-5  The protocol SHOULD work over TCP.

   REQ-6  The media stream, or media control server, to be controlled by
          the client may be located in the network or in the home
          network.

   REQ-7  The media control protocol shall consider additional commands
          not available in RTSP to control the media in the server.
          Examples of such commands are deletion or saving of voice
          messages.



5.  Considerations for session control protocol

   This section raises a number of areas that need consideration while
   developing new standards for the use cases:

   1.  RTSP protocol assumes a media server is located in the network
   and not in the home.  The session protocol shall be possible to
   establish a relationship that allows for control of media resoruces
   in both the home and network.

   2.  The session protocol shall be able to handle NAT and not affect
   the call flows being defined.

   3.  If assuming SIP for session protocol there is a well accepted
   architecture defined called IMS, IP Multimedia Solution, which is
   accepted by a number of standard organizations like 3GPP, ETSI
   TISPAN, ATIS, etc.  There is a number of services have been defined
   using the architecture like telephony, push to talk, presence,
   messaging, chat and IPTV.




Whitehead, et al.       Expires November 8, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    media playback protocol requirements          May 2008


   4.  In conjunction with IMS there is a resource and admition control
   architecture called RACS defined in ETSI TISPAN which helps ensure
   QoS for services defined over IMS and addresses reuse of network
   resources.  What is of special interest is bandwidth reservation is
   addressed for unicast and multicast media streams as well as handling
   of multicast addresses used for IPTV.

   5.  IMS also provides additional authentication mechanisms which
   allow alternatives for HTTP Digest like the Authentication and Key
   Agreement mechanism (AKA).

   6.  The session protocol shall allow server initiated control of
   streaming sessions such as server-initiated session terminations.
   RTSP TEARDOWNs are from client to server only.


6.  Call Flows of Use Cases

6.1.  Content on Demand Session Initiation

   For content on demand the session initiation established two media
   streams, one for media control channel and one for media delivery
   channel between the entities Media Control Client and Server.  All
   required information for establishing the two channels are conveyed
   in the session initiation.

   The proxy acts as back-to-back user agent for the session control.
   The proxy may open pin-holes for the media control channel and
   protocol.  The proxy is used to protect the core network which the
   Media Control Server is located.


  Media Control Client            Proxy             Media Control Server
        |                           |                           |
  1.    |--- session initiation --->|                           |
  2.    |                           |--- session initiation --->|
  3.    |                           |<-- confirm initiation ----|
  4.    |<-- confirm initiation ----|                           |
  5.    |<-- Media control channel established ---------------->|
        |                                                       |
  6.    |=== request play media ===============================>|
  7.    |<== confirm play media ================================|
        |                                                       |
  8.    |<-- Media delivery channel established --------------->|

   The Media Control Client or Server do not need to be strickly located
   in a home for the Client and the network for the Server.  The roles
   may reversed.  The Client may be located in the network as a remote

   user attempting to access the content in the home; the Server is then
   located in the home.

   Other use cases compared to content on demand may be supported that
   follow theses sequences.  For example voice/video mailbox may be
   supported.

6.2.  Content on Demand Session Termination

   When content on demand is terminated either the media control client
   or server may initiate a session termination.  Pin-holes that may
   previously have been established are closed.


  Media Control Client            Proxy             Media Control Server
        |                           |                           |
  1.    |--- session termination -->|                           |
  2.    |                           |--- session termination -->|
  3.    |                           |<-- confirm termination ---|
  4.    |<-- confirm termination ---|                           |

   Alternatively the server may terminate the session.


  Media Control Client            Proxy             Media Control Server
        |                           |                           |
  1.    |                           |<--- session termination --|
  2.    |<--- session termination --|                           |
  3.    |--- confirm termination--->|                           |
  4.    |                           |--- confirm termination -->|

6.3.  Activation of trick play of linear TV Session Modification

   The first 5 steps setup linear TV and a multicast media delivery
   channel.  If proxy is aware of the bandwidth limitations for the
   client it may reserve the required bandwidth for the session.  Note
   that parallel sessions may be established for the same client to
   convey multiple linear TV channels at the same time.

   When the user pauses live TV the same session is used to modify the
   media requirements from a multicast media channel to a media control
   and unicast media channels.  If session modification is successful
   then the live TV is paused.  If unsuccessful then the linear TV is
   maintained without affecting the use viewing experience.  By
   performing the action within the same session network resources are
   not released when transitioning between multicast and unicast
   otherwise there is a risk that resources are not anymore available if
   trying to reestablish the previous session.

6.4.  Deactivation of trick play of linear TV Session Modification

   When the user switches TV channels or catches up with live TV then
   the session modification is performed and media requirements are

   media channel.  Note that if user chooses to end viewing session
   termination is performed directly with modification.
