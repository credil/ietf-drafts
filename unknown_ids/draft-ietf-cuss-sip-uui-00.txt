 A Mechanism for Transporting User to User Call Control Information in
                                  SIP
                       draft-ietf-cuss-sip-uui-00

Abstract

   There is a need for applications using SIP to exchange User to User
   Information (UUI) data during session establishment.  This
   information, known as call control UUI, is a small piece of data
   inserted by an application initiating the session, and utilized by an
   application accepting the session.  This data is opaque to SIP and
   its function is unrelated to any basic SIP function.  This document
   defines a new SIP header field, User-to-User, to transport UUI, along
   with an extension mechanism.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                February 2011


1.  Overview

   This document describes the transport of User to User Information
   (UUI) using SIP [RFC3261].  Specifically, we discuss a mechanism for
   the transport of general application UUI and also for the transport
   of call control related ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information Element
   (UU IE) [Q931] and ITU-T Q.763 User to User Information Parameter
   [Q763] data in SIP.  UUI is widely used in the PSTN today in contact
   centers and call centers which are transitioning away from ISDN to
   SIP.  This extension will also be used for native SIP endpoints
   implementing similar services and interworking with ISDN services.

   This mechanism was designed to meet the use cases, requirements, and
   call flows for SIP call control UUI detailed in
   [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].  All references to requirement numbers
   (REQ-N) and figure numbers refer to this document.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements Discussion

   This section describes how the User-to-User header field can meet the
   requirements in [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].  The header field would
   be included in INVITE requests and responses and BYE requests and
   responses, and would pass transparently through proxies.

   Requirements REQ-8 and REQ-10 relate to discovery of the mechanism
   and supported applications.  REQ-8 could be met by defining a new SIP
   option tag 'uui'.  The use of a 'Require: uui' in a request, or
   'Supported: uui' in an OPTIONS response could be used to require or
   discover support of the mechanism.  REQ-10 could be met by creating a
   new class of SIP feature tags.  For example, the feature tag
   'sip.uui.isdn' could be used to indicate support of the ISDN UUI
   service, or 'sip.uui.app1' could be used to indicate support for a
   particular application.

   For redirection and referral use cases and REQ-3, the header field
   would be escaped into the Contact or Refer-To URI.  Currently, UAs
   that support attended transfer support the ability to escape a
   Replaces header field into a Refer-To URI, and when acting upon this
   URI add the Replaces header field to the triggered INVITE.  This

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                February 2011


   logic and behavior is identical for the proposed UUI header field.

   To meet REQ-12 in redirection and referral use cases, a History-Info
   [I-D.ietf-sipcore-rfc4244bis] extension could be used.  During
   redirection or retargeting, History-Info captures the history and the
   identity of the entity performing the redirection or referral.  A new
   History-Info parameter could be defined to indicate that the UUI was
   inserted during this operation.  The source of UUI inserted during
   redirection or referral could then be determined by examination of
   the History-Info header field.

   OPEN ISSUE: How important is it to meet this requirement?  Is
   History-Info the right way?

   The requirement for integrity protection in REQ-13 could be met by
   the use of an S/MIME signature over a subset of header fields, as
   defined in Section 23.4 of RFC 3261 "SIP Header Privacy and Integrity
   using S/MIME: Tunneling SIP".  It could not be achieved using RFC
   4474 without some sort of extension.  The requirement for end-to-end
   privacy could be met using S/MIME or using encryption at the
   application layer.  Note that the use of S/MIME to secure the UUI
   will result in an additional body being added to the request.

   OPEN ISSUE: Is there interest in developing this mechanism?

   For example, here is an example User-to-User header field from
   message F1 in Figure 1 of [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs]:

   User-to-User: 56a390f3d2b7310023a;encoding=hex;purpose=isdn-interwork
    ;content=isdn-uui

   As another example, here is an escaped User-to-User header field from
   the redirection response F2 of Figure 3:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?User-to-User=
   56a390f3d2b7310023a%3Bencoding%3Dhex%3Bpurpose%3Disdn-interwork%3B
   content%3Disdn-uui>
   </allOneLine>

   The resulting INVITE F5 would contain:

   User-to-User: 56a390f3d2b7310023a;encoding=hex;purpose=isdn-interwork
    ;content=isdn-uui

   An escaped User-to-User header field from the REFER message response
   F1 of Figure 4:

   <allOneLine>
   Refer-To: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?User-to-User=
   56a390f3d2b7310023a%3Bencoding%3Dhex%3Bpurpose%3Disdn-interwork%3B
   content%3Disdn-uui>
   </allOneLine>

   This would result in the INVITE F4 containing:

   User-to-User: 56a390f3d2b7310023a;encoding=hex;purpose=isdn-interwork
    ;content=isdn-uui

   The header field approach meets REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3, REQ-4, REQ-5,
   REQ-7, REQ-9, REQ-11, REQ-13, and REQ-14.  The mechanism can likely
   meet REQ-12 with a History-Info extension.


4.  Normative Definition

   This document defines a new SIP header field "User-to-User" to
   transport call control UUI to meet the requirements in
   [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].

   To help tag and identify the UUI used with this header field,
   "purpose", "content", and "encoding" parameters are defined.  This
   specification only defines "encoding=hex".  Other specifications can
   define other purposes and contents for this header field per the
   requirements of this document.

4.1.  Syntax for UUI Header Field

   The User-to-User header field can be present in INVITE requests and
   responses only and in BYE requests and responses.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC 2234 and extends RFC 3261.

       UUI         = "User-to-User" HCOLON uui-data *(SEMI uui-param)
       uui-data    = token
       uui-param   = enc-param | cont-param | purp-param | generic-param
       enc-param   = "encoding="("hex" | token)
       cont-param  = "content=" token
       purp-param  = "purpose=" token

   If the encoding parameter is not present, the default value of "hex"
   MUST be assumed.  Other encoding methods of encoding MAY also be
   standardized.

   OPEN ISSUE: Is this encoding the encoding used by SIP, or the



Johnston, et al.         Expires August 11, 2011                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                February 2011


   encoding used by the application?  For interworking with ISDN, these
   are not necessarily the same thing.  For example, the data coming
   from ISDN may be encoded as IA5.  However, this data may then be
   encoded in SIP as hex.  Earlier versions have defined an
   "encoding=ia5" parameter, but do we need this?  Or do we actually
   have UUI data that is encoded and transported over SIP using IA5?

   User-to-User header fields with different purpose parameters may be
   present in a request or response.  The number of User-to-User header
   fields which may be present in a request or response is defined for a
   particular purpose (application).  Any size limitations on the UUI
   for a particular purpose must be defined by that purpose.

4.2.  Definition of New Parameter Values

   This specification defines only the values of "hex" for the
   "encoding" parameter.  New values can be defined and added to the
   IANA registry with a standards track RFC, which needs to discuss the
   issues in this section.

   New "encoding" values must reference a common encoding scheme or
   define the exact new encoding scheme.

   New "content" values must describe the content of the UUI and give
   some example use cases.  The default "encoding" and other allowed
   encoding methods must be defined for this new content.

   New "purpose" values must describe the new purpose and give some
   example use cases.  The default "content" value and other allowed
   contents must be defined for this new purpose.  Any restrictions on
   the size of the UUI data must be described for the new purpose.


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Registration of Header Field

   This document defines a new SIP header field named "User-to-User".

   The following row shall be added to the "Header Fields" section of
   the SIP parameter registry:

5.2.  Registration of Header Field Parameters

   This document defines the parameters for the header field defined in
   the preceding section.  The header field "User-to-User" can contain
   the parameters "encoding", "content", and "purpose".

   The following rows shall be added to the "Header Field Parameters and
   Parameter Values" section of the SIP parameter registry:


   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
   | Header Field     | Parameter Name | Predefined Values | Reference |

   | User-to-User     | encoding       | hex               | [RFCXXXX] |
   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   this document.

5.3.  Registration of SIP Option Tag

   This specification registers a new SIP option tag, as per the
   guidelines in Section 27.1 of [RFC3261].

   This document defines the SIP option tag "uui".

   The following row has been added to the "Option Tags" section of the
   SIP Parameter Registry:

   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | Name       | Description                              | Reference |

   |            | User-to-User header field.               |           |
   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   this document.


6.  Security Considerations

   User to user information can potentially carry sensitive information
   that might require privacy or integrity protection.  Standard



Johnston, et al.         Expires August 11, 2011                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                February 2011


   deployed SIP security mechanisms such as TLS transport, offer these
   properties on a hop-by-hop basis.  To preserve multi-hop or end-to-
   end confidentiality and integrity of UUI, approaches using S/MIME or
   RFC 4474 can be used, as discussed in the draft.  However, the lack
   of deployment of these mechanisms means that applications can not in
   general rely on them.  As such, applications are encouraged to
   utilize their own security mechanisms.


7.  Appendix - Other Possible Mechanisms

   Two other possible mechanisms for transporting UUI will be described:
   MIME body and URI parameter transport.

7.1.  Why INFO is Not Used

   Since the INFO method [RFC2976], was developed for ISUP interworking
   of user-to-user information, it might seem to be the logical choice
   here.  For non-call control user-to-user information, INFO can be
   utilized for end to end transport.  However, for transport of call
   control user-to-user information, INFO can not be used.  As the call
   flows in [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs] show, the information is
   related to an attempt to establish a session and must be passed with
   the session setup request (INVITE), responses to that INVITE, or
   session termination requests.  As a result, it is not possible to use
   INFO in these cases.

7.2.  Why Other Protocol Encapsulation UUI Mechanisms are Not Used

   Other protocols have the ability to transport UUI information.  For
   example, consider the ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information Element
   (UU IE) [Q931] and the ITU-T Q.763 User to User Information Parameter
   [Q763].  In addition, NSS (Narrowband Signaling System) [Q1980] is
   also able to transport UUI information.  Should one of these
   protocols be in use, and present in both User Agents, then utilizing
   these other protocols to transport UUI might be a logical solution.
   Essentially, this is just adding an additional layer in the protocol
   stack.  In these cases, SIP is not transporting the UUI; it is
   encapsulating another protocol, and that protocol is transporting the
   UUI.  Once a mechanism to transport that other protocol using SIP
   exists, the UUI transport function is essentially obtained without
   any additional effort or work.

   However, the authors believe that SIP needs to have its own native
   UUI transport mechanism.  It is not reasonable for a SIP UA to have
   to implement another entire protocol (either ISDN or NSS, for
   example) just to get the very simple UUI transport service.  Of
   course, this work does not preclude anyone from using other protocols



Johnston, et al.         Expires August 11, 2011                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                February 2011


   with SIP to transport UUI information.

7.3.  MIME body Approach

   One method of transport is to use a MIME body.  This is in keeping
   with the SIP-T architecture [RFC3372] in which MIME bodies are used
   to transport ISUP information.  Since the INVITE will normally have
   an SDP message body, the resulting INVITE with SDP and UUI will be
   multipart MIME.  This is not ideal as many SIP UAs do not support
   multipart MIME INVITEs.

   A bigger problem is the insertion of a UUI message body by a redirect
   server or in a REFER.  The body would need to be encoded in the
   Contact URI of the 3xx response or the Refer-To URI of a REFER.
   Currently, the authors are not aware of any UAs that support this
   capability today for any body type.  As such, the complete set of
   semantics for this operation would need to be determined and defined.
   Some issues will need to be resolved, such as, do all the Content-*
   header fields have to be escaped as well?  And, what if the escaped
   Content-Length does not agree with the escaped body?

   Since proxies cannot remove a body from a request or response, it is
   not at all clear how this mechanism could meet REQ-9.

   The requirement for integrity protection could be met by the use of
   an S/MIME signature over the body, as defined in Section 23.3 of RFC
   3261 "Securing MIME bodies".  Alternatively, this could be achieved
   using RFC 4474 [RFC4474].  The requirement for end-to-end privacy
   could be met using S/MIME encryption or using encryption at the
   application layer.  However, note that neither S/MIME or RFC 4474
   enjoys deployment in SIP today.

   An example:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?Content-Type=
   application/uui&body=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
   </allOneLine>

   Note that the <allOneLine> tag convention from SIP  Torture Test
   Messages [RFC4475] is used to show that there are no line breaks in
   the actual message syntax.

   As such, the MIME body approach meets REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-4, REQ-5,
   REQ-7, REQ-11, REQ-13, and REQ-14.  Meeting REQ-12 seems possible,
   although the authors do not have a specific mechanism to propose.
   Meeting REQ-3 is problematic, but not impossible for this mechanism.
   However, this mechanism does not seem to be able to meet REQ-9.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                February 2011


7.4.  URI Parameter

   Another proposed approach is to encode the UUI as a URI parameter.
   This UUI parameter could be included in a Request-URI or in the
   Contact URI or Refer-To URI.  It is not clear how it could be
   transported in a responses which does not have a Request-URI, or in
   BYE requests or responses.

  <allOneLine>
  Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com;uui=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6
  F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
  </allOneLine>

   An INVITE sent to this Contact URI would contain UUI in the Request-
   URI of the INVITE.  The URI parameter has a drawback in that a URI
   parameter carried in a Request-URI will not survive retargeting by a
   proxy as shown in Figure 2 of [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].  That is,
   if the URI is included with an Address of Record instead of a Contact
   URI, the URI parameter in the Reqeuest-URI will not be copied over to
   the Contact URI, resulting in the loss of the information.  Note that
   if this same URI was present in a Refer-To header field, the same
   loss of information would occur.

   The URI parameter approach would meet REQ-3, REQ-5, REQ-7, REQ-9, and
   REQ-11.  It is possible the approach could meet REQ-12 and REQ-13.
   The mechanism does not appear to meet REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-4, and
   REQ-14.
