    <abstract>
      <t>The Diameter base protocol specifies mechanisms whereby a given 
      realm may advertise Diameter nodes and the supported transport protocol. 
      However, these mechanisms do not reveal the Diameter applications that each 
      node supports. A peer outside the realm would have to perform a Diameter
      capability exchange with every node until it discovers one that supports
      the required application. This document updates  <xref target="RFC3588"/> 
      and describes an improvement using an extended format for the 
      Straightforward-NAPTR (S-NAPTR) Application Service Tag 
      that allows for discovery of the supported applications without doing 
      Diameter capability exchange beforehand.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Diameter base protocol <xref target="RFC3588"/> 
      specifies three mechanisms for the Diameter peer discovery. One of these 
      involves the Diameter implementation performing a NAPTR query <xref 
      target="RFC3403"/> for a server in a particular realm. 
      These NAPTR records provide a mapping from a domain, to the SRV record 
      <xref target="RFC2782"/> or A/AAAA record <xref target="RFC1035"/><xref target="RFC3596"/> for contacting a server with the specific
      transport protocol in the NAPTR services field. </t>
      <t>The extended NAPTR usage for Diameter peer discovery defined by
      this document is based on the Straightforward-NAPTR (S-NAPTR) Dynamic 
      Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application defined in 
      <xref target="RFC3958"/>. This document updates the Diameter peer 
      discovery procedure described in Section 11.6 of <xref target="RFC3588"/> 
      and defines S-NAPTR Application Service and Application Protocol Tag 
      values that permit the discovery of Diameter peers that support 
      a specific Diameter application and transport protocol.

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The Diameter base protocol specification (Section 1.4 of 
      <xref target="RFC3588"/>) and the Straightforward-NAPTR (S-NAPTR) DDDS
      application (section 2.1 in <xref target="RFC3958"/>) define the terminology
      used in this document.</t>

      <t>The NAPTR Service Field format defined by the S-NAPTR DDDS application
      in <xref target="RFC3958"/> follows this Augmented Backus-Naur Form 
      (ABNF, <xref target="RFC5234"/>):

      <t>The maximum length of the NAPTR service field is 256 octets including

      <section title="IETF Standard Track Diameter Applications ">
      <t>A Diameter agent MUST be capable of using the extended S-NAPTR 
      Application Service Tag for dynamic discovery of a Diameter agent 
      supporting Standard Track applications. Therefore, every IETF 
      Standard Track Diameter application MUST be associated with a 
      "aaa-service" tag formatted as defined in this specification
      and allocated in accordance with the IANA policy 
      (see <xref target="IANA"/>).

    <section title="Backwards Compatibility">
      <t>DNS administrators SHOULD also provision 
         legacy RFC 3588 style NAPTR records <xref target="RFC2915"/> in order to
         guarantee backwards compatibility with legacy RFC 3588 compliant
         Diameter peers. If the DNS administrator provisions 
         both extended S-NAPTR records as defined in this specification and 
         legacy RFC 3588 NAPTR records, then the extended S-NAPTR records 
         MUST have higher priority (e.g. lower order and/or preference 
         values) than legacy NAPTR records.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Extended NAPTR-based Diameter Peer Discovery">
      <t>The Diameter Peer Discovery principles are described in
         Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC3588"/>. 
         This specification updates the NAPTR query procedure in the Diameter 
         peer discovery mechanism by allowing the querying node to determine 
         which applications are supported by resolved Diameter peers.
         </t> 
      <t>The extended format NAPTR records provide a mapping from a domain 
         to the SRV record or A/AAAA record for contacting a server 
         supporting a specific transport protocol and Diameter application.
         The resource record will contain an empty regular expression and a 
         replacement value, which is the SRV record or the A/AAAA record 
         for that particular transport protocol.</t>
      <t>The assumption for this mechanism to work is that the DNS 
         administrator of the queried domain has first provisioned the DNS
         with extended format NAPTR entries. The steps below replace the 
         NAPTR query procedure steps in Section 5.2 of <xref

    <section title="Usage Guidelines">
      <t>Diameter is a peer to peer protocol whereas most of the applications that
      extend the base protocol behave like client/server applications. The role
      of the peer is not advertised in the NAPTR tags and not even communicated
      during Diameter capability negotiation (CER/CEA). For this reason,
      NAPTR-based Diameter peer discovery for an application defining client/server
      roles should only be used by a client to discover servers.

      protocol defined NAPTR service field format and also modifications to the NAPTR processing logic defined. The enhancements and modifications are
      based on the S-NAPTR, which is actually a simplification of the NAPTR,
      and therefore the same security considerations described in RFC 3588 are
      applicable to this document. No further extensions are required beyond
      the security mechanisms offered by RFC 3588.
      However, a malicious host doing S-NAPTR queries learns applications 
      supported by Diameter agents in a certain realm faster, which might
      help the malicious host to scan potential targets for an attack 
      more efficiently when some applications have known vulnerabilities.</t>

    <section title="Editor's Notes">
       <t>This section to be removed prior to publication.</t>
       <t>This draft updates sections of RFC3588 that are also being updated by
       RFC3588bis. At the time this draft was started, it was uncertain whether 
       RFC3588bis would be published first. The authors of this draft decided 
       to proceed optimistically assuming this draft would be published first 
       with the understanding that minor updates are required if this is not 
       the case.
       </t>
       <t>The application-neutral aspects of Diameter S-NAPTR usage 
       (e.g "aaa:diameter.sctp") were also contributed to RFC3588bis to ensure
       that it would be functionally complete if it got published first and this
       draft would come along later to add the application-specific S-NAPTR 
       entries (e.g."aaa+ap5:diameter.sctp").
       </t>
       <t>
       Depending on the publication order, the S-NAPTR Application Service 
       Tag registry value of "aaa" and the S-NAPTR Application Protocol Tags
       values ("diameter.tcp"/"diameter.sctp"/"diameter.tls.tcp") will need to
       be removed either from this draft or RFC3588bis.
