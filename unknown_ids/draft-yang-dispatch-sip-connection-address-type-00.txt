   Session Description Protocol (SDP) Extension for a SIP Connection
                              Address Type
           draft-yang-dispatch-sip-connection-address-type-00

Abstract

   This memo describes use cases, requirements, and protocol extensions
   for using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer model
   for a SIP connection address type in order to provide a mechanism
   which allows the transport of a SIP URI within the SDP connection
   line, for use when the actual IP addresses are not known at offer/
   answer time.

Internet-Draft         SIP Connection Address Type             June 2010


1.  Introduction

   There are different scenarios in which a device needs to establish a
   media session which is not terminated locally at the establishing
   device, but at a different entity.  Such an entity can for example be
   a TV set, which shows the video portion of a multimedia phone call,
   whilst the voice portion is still handled by the local phone, which
   acts as the controller of the session.  Other scenarios require that
   a device can redirect parts of a session towards a specific media
   server in the network, e.g. for playing announcements or
   advertisement to a user.

   When the controlling device has access to the IP address of the
   entity to which it wants to redirect the media stream, existing SDP
   capabilities are sufficient (simply include those IP addresses in the
   SDP exchange).  However, in some scenarios it is not guaranteed that
   the controlling device has access to this IP address.  In some cases
   the address of the related entity is only known as a URI, e.g. a SIP
   URI.


2.  Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements

   This section presents the general requirements that are specific for
   the establishment of the collaborative session:

   REQ-1:  a mechanism that allows a device to redirect a local media
           stream to a dedicated media server within the network (e.g. a
           streaming server or a TV set), where only a SIP / SIPS URI of
           the media server is known to the device, i.e. no IP address
           is known.
   REQ-2:  a mechanism that allows two or more devices to find out
           whether the remote device supports SIP / SIPS URI addressing
           of SDP media streams.


4.  Overview of Operation

   The mechanism defined in this memo extends SDP and allows describing
   the transport of a SIP URI within connection line.  New tokens are
   registered in the "C=" lines to be able to describe a SIP URI.  These

Internet-Draft         SIP Connection Address Type             June 2010


   SDP extensions are described in Section 5.2.

4.1.  Example

   In this example, Alice (sip:alice@example1.net) calls Bob
   (sip:bob@example-remote.net).  Alice wants to establish two different
   media streams:

   1.  a voice media stream from Alice's device, registered with IP
       address 192.0.2.5
   2.  a video media stream from Anna's device, of which Alice only
       knows the SIP address sip:anna@example2.net

   In order to achieve this, Alice needs to indicate the following
   indications in the SDP:

           m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0 8 3
           c=IN IP4 192.0.2.5
           m=video 9 RTP/AVP 34
           c=SIP SIPURI sip:anna@example2.net


5.  Protocol Description

5.1.  Level of Compliance

   Implementations of this specification MUST implement the SDP
   extensions described in Section 5.2.

5.2.  Extensions to SDP

   This section provides the syntax and semantics of the extensions
   required for providing a description in SDP of audio or video media
   streams which are established at an entity of which only the SIP
   address is available.

5.2.1.  Connection Data

   According to SDP [RFC4566], the connection data line in SDP has the
   following syntax:

   c=<nettype> <addrtype> <connection-address>

   Where <nettype> indicates the network type, <addrtype> indicates the
   address type, and the <connection-address> is the connection address,
   which is dependent on the address type.

   At the moment, the only network type defined is "IN", which indicates

   Internet network type.  The address types "IP4" and "IP6" indicate
   the type of IP addresses.

   This memo defines a new network type for describing a SIP-based
   telecommunication infrastructure.

5.2.2.  Advanced SDP example

   Using the mechanisms described in SDP Capability Negotiation
   Framework [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation] and extensions
   thereof (SDP media capabilities Negotiation[I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-
   media-capabilities] and SDP MiscellaneousCapabilities [I-D.ietf-
   mmusic-sdp-misc-cap]) it is possible to construct an SDP offer where
   audio and video media can be offered using either an IP address or a
   SIP URI.

            v=0
            o=jdoe 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 192.0.2.5
            s=
            t=0 0
            c=IN IP4 192.0.2.5
            a=creq:ccap-v0
            m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0 8 3
            m=video 49174 RTP/AVP 34
            a=ccap:1 SIP SIPS sips:anne@example.com

   Figure 1 : SDP offer with SIP network type connection data
   alternative

   In this example, if the remote side does not support the SIP network
   type connection data for the video stream, the video stream would
   automatically be terminated by the originating endpoint at IP address
   192.0.2.5.

   If the terminating endpoint supports the SIP network type connection
   data, it will respond as follows:

            v=0
            o=jdoe 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 192.0.2.5
            s=
            t=0 0
            c=IN IP4 192.0.2.5
            a=creq:ccap-v0
            m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0 8 3
            m=video 49174 RTP/AVP 34
            c=SIP SIPS sips:anne@example.com

6.  Formal Syntax

   The following is the formal Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] syntax that supports the extensions defined in this
   specification.  The syntax is built above the SDP [RFC4566] grammar.
   Implementations according to this specification MUST be compliant
   with this syntax.

   If the terminating endpoint supports the SIP network type connection
   data, it will respond as follows:

           ; extension to the connection field originally specified
           ; in RFC 4566

           connection-field   =  [%x63 "=" nettype SP addrtype SP
           connection-address CRLF]

           ;nettype and addrtype are defined in RFC 4566

           connection-address /=  URI-address / "-"
           URI-address       =  SIP-URI/SIPS-URI

7.  Security Considerations

   This document provides an extension on top of 4566 [RFC4566].  As
   such, the security considerations of that document apply.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document instructs IANA to register a number of SDP tokens
   according to the following data.

   NOTE to IANA: please replace "(this RFC)" with the RFC number for
   this specification when it is available - thanks!

8.1.  Registration of a new "nettype" value

   This memo provides instructions to IANA to register a new "nettype"
   in the Session Description Protocol Parameters registry [1].  The
   registration data, according to RFC 4566 [RFC4566] follows.
