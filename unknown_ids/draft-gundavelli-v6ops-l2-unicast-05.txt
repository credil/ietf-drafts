         Address Mapping of IPv6 multicast packets on Ethernet
                draft-gundavelli-v6ops-l2-unicast-05.txt

Abstract

   When transmitting an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination
   address, the IPv6 destination address is mapped to an Ethernet link-
   layer multicast address.  This document clarifies that a mapping of
   an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination address may in some
   circumstances map to an Ethernet link-layer unicast address.

1.  Introduction

   Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet [RFC2464] section 7,
   specifies how an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination address is
   mapped into an Ethernet link-layer address.  This document extends
   this mapping to explicitly allow for a mapping of an IPv6 packet with
   a multicast destination address into an Ethernet link-layer unicast
   address, when it is clear that only one address is relevant.

   This mapping does not replace the mapping described in [RFC2464]
   section 7.  Sending a targeted multicast packet, i.e. sending an IPv6
   packet with a multicast destination address to an Ethernet link-layer
   unicast address, is only reasonable if the unicast address is known
   and is reasonably believed to be the only address relevant.

   The determination of the unicast Ethernet link-layer address and the
   construction of the outgoing IPv6 packet are out of scope for this
   document.

3.  Sending and receiving IPv6 multicast packets

   The following additional considerations apply to all IPv6 nodes when
   sending and receiving IPv6 multicast messages.

   o  An IPv6 node transmitting an IPv6 packet with a multicast
      destination address MAY use a unicast Ethernet link-layer address.

   o  An IPv6 node receiving an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination
      address and an Ethernet link-layer unicast address MUST NOT drop
      the packet as a result of the use of this form of address mapping.
