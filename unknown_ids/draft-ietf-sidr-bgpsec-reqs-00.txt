Internet-Draft    Requirements for BGP Path Validation         June 2011


1.  Introduction

   RPKI-based Origin Validation ([I-D.ietf-sidr-pfx-validate]) provides
   a measure of resilience to accidental mis-origination of prefixes.
   But it provides neither cryptographic assurance (announcements are
   not signed), nor assurance of the AS Path of the announcement.

   This document describes requirements to be placed on a BGP security
   protocol, herein termed BGPsec, intended to rectify these gaps.

   The threat model assumed here is documented in [RFC4593] and
   [I-D.kent-bgpsec-threats].


2.  Recommended Reading

   This document assumes knowledge of the RPKI see [I-D.ietf-sidr-arch]
   and the RPKI Repository Structure, see [I-D.ietf-sidr-repos-struct].

   This document assumes ongoing incremental deployment of ROAs, see
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-roa-format], the RPKI to Router Protocol, see
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr], and RPKI-based Prefix Validation, see
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-pfx-validate].

   And, of course, a knowledge of BGP [RFC4271] is required.


3.  General Requirements

   The following are general requirements for a BGPsec protocol:

   3.1   A BGPsec design must allow the receiver of a BGP announcement
         to determine, to a strong level of certainty, that the received
         PATH attribute accurately represents the sequence of eBGP
         exchanges that propagated the prefix from the origin AS to the
         receiver.

   3.2   A BGPsec design MUST be amenable to incremental deployment.
         Any incompatible protocol capabilities MUST be negotiated.

   3.3   A BGPsec design MUST provide analysis of the operational
         considerations for deployment and particularly of incremental
         deployment, e.g, contiguous islands, non-contiguous islands,
         universal deployment, etc..

   3.4   As cryptographic payloads and memory requirements on routers
         are likely to increase, a BGPsec design MAY require use of new
         hardware.  I.e. compatibility with current hardware abilities
         is not a requirement that this document imposes on a solution.
         As BGPsec will likely not be rolled out for some years, this
         should not be a major problem.

   3.5   A BGPsec design need not prevent attacks on data plane traffic.
         It need not provide assurance that the data plane even follows
         the control plane.

   3.6   A BGPsec design MUST resist attacks by an enemy who has access
         to the link layer, per Section 3.1.1.2 of [RFC4593].  In
         particular, such a design must provide mechanisms for
         authentication of all data, including protecting against
         message insertion, deletion, modification, or replay.
         Mechanisms that suffice include TCP sessions authenticated with
         IPsec [RFC4301] or TLS [RFC5246].

   3.7   A BGPsec design MAY make use of a security infrastructure
         (e.g., a PKI) to distribute authenticated data used as input to
         routing decisions.  Such data include information about
         holdings of address space and ASNs, and assertions about
         binding of address space to ASNs.

   3.8   If message signing increases message size, the 4096 byte limit
         on BGP PDU size MAY be removed.

   3.9   It is entirely OPTIONAL to secure AS SETs and prefix
         aggregation.  The long range solution to this is the
         deprecation of AS-SETs, see [I-D.wkumari-deprecate-as-sets].

   3.10  If a BGPsec design uses signed prefixes, given the difficulty
         of splitting a signed message while preserving the signature,
         it need NOT handle multiple prefixes in a single UPDATE PDU.

   3.11  A BGPsec design MUST enable each BGPsec speaker to configure
         use of the security mechanism on a per-peer basis.

   3.12  A BGPsec design MUST provide backward compatibility in the
         message formatting, transmission, and processing of routing
         information carried through a mixed security environment.
         Message formatting in a fully secured environment MAY be
         handled in a non-backward compatible manner.

   3.13  While the trust level of an NLRI should be determined by the
         BGPsec protocol, local routing preference and policy MUST then
         be applied to best path and other decisions.  Such mechanisms
         MUST conform with [I-D.ietf-sidr-ltamgmt].

   3.14  If a BGPsec design makes use of a security infrastructure, that
         infrastructure SHOULD enable each network operator to select
         the entities it will trust when authenticating data in the
         security infrastructure.  See, for example,
         [I-D.ietf-sidr-ltamgmt].

   3.15  A BGPsec design MUST NOT require operators to reveal more than
         is currently revealed in the operational inter-domain routing
         environment, other than the inclusion of necessary security
         credentials to allow others to ascertain for themselves the
         necessary degree of assurance regarding the validity of NLRI
         received via BGPsec.  This includes peering, customer, and
         provider relationships, an ISP's internal infrastructure, etc.
         It is understood that some data are revealed to the savvy
         seeker by BGP, traceroute, etc. today.

   3.16  A BGPsec design SHOULD flag security exceptions which are
         significant enough to be logged.  The specific data to be
         logged are an implementation matter.

   3.17  Any routing information database MAY be re-authenticated
         periodically or in an event-driven manner, especially in
         response to events such as, for example, PKI updates.

   3.18  Should a BGPsec design use hashes or signatures, it should
         provide mechanisms for algorithm agility.

   3.19  A BGPsec design SHOULD NOT presume to know the intent of the
         originator of a NLRI, nor that of any AS on the AS Path.

   3.20  A BGP listener SHOULD NOT trust non-BGPsec markings, such as
         communities, across trust boundaries.


4.  BGP UPDATE Security Requirements

   The following requirements MUST be met in the processing of BGP
   UPDATE messages:

   4.1  A BGPsec design MUST enable each recipient of an UPDATE to
        formally validate that the origin AS in the message is
        authorized to originate a route to the prefix(es) in the
        message.

Internet-Draft    Requirements for BGP Path Validation         June 2011


   4.2  A BGPsec design MUST enable the recipient of an UPDATE to
        formally determine that the NLRI has traversed the AS path
        indicated in the UPDATE.  Note that this is more stringent than
        showing that the path is merely not impossible.

   4.3  Replay of BGP UPDATE messages need not be completely prevented,
        but a BGPsec design MUST provide a mechanism to control the
        window of exposure to replay attacks.

   4.4  A BGPsec design SHOULD provide some level of assurance that the
        origin of a prefix is still 'alive', i.e. that a monkey in the
        middle has not withheld a WITHDRAW message or the effects
        thereof.

   4.5  NLRI of the UPDATE message SHOULD be able to be authenticated in
        real-time as the message is processed.

   4.6  Normal sanity checks of received announcements MUST be done,
        e.g. verification that the first element of the AS_PATH list
        corresponds to the locally configured AS of the peer from which
        the UPDATE was received.

   4.7  The output of a router applying BGPsec to a received signed
        UPDATE MUST be either Valid or Unverified.  There should be no
        shades of grey.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document asks nothing of the IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   The data plane may not follow the control plane.

   Security for subscriber traffic is outside the scope of this
   document, and of BGP security in general.  IETF standards for payload
   data security should be employed.  While adoption of BGP security
   measures may ameliorate some classes of attacks on traffic, these
   measures are not a substitute for use of subscriber-based security.
