Internet-Draft         Broadband Network Use Case         September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The situations of IPv6 transition for developing countries are
   different from the developed countries.  The developed countries,
   which is the originate place of Internet, hold the majority part of
   IPv4 address space.  However, according to the considerably high
   growth speed of the potential subscribers in the developing countries
   due to the large base number of users and booming economies, e.g.
   China,Brazil and India, the small IPv4 address space do put these
   developing countries under great pressure.

   Generally speaking,developing countries have a large number of
   subscribers.Some of them with more than dozen millions of broadband
   subscribers, increase at a rate of 20+ percent of subscribers
   annually.

   Developing coutries are facing unprecedented pressure in business
   aspect, with the Global IPv4 address exhaustion.  Therefore
   developing coutries's network and services will migrate to IPv6
   eventually.  However, during the transition procedure, developing
   coutries should seriously concerned about the transition of existing
   services in order to support the v4v6 coexistent environment, along
   with the researches and developments of new services and
   applications.  Developing coutries broadband networks are so large
   with various types of service that the transition to IPv6 is doomed
   to be complicated and difficult.

   One of the typical network structure is shown in Figure 1.  As this
   figure shows, the network comprises three segments: backbone network
   which usually includes IP backbone and MPLS backbone, metro network
   (MAN) which basically includes Core Router(CR),Aggregation Router(AR)
   and Broadband Remote Access Server(BRAS), and access network covers
   from BRAS to users' Customer Premises Equipment(CPE).

          Figure 1: Architecture of the typical broadband Network

   The backbone network provides long distance transmission for the
   broadband traffic, which includes an IP backbone and a MPLS one.  The
   former one provides Internet service for home users and SME (Small
   and Medium Enterprise) users while the latter one provides VPN and
   leased line services for the enterprise customers.

Internet-Draft         Broadband Network Use Case         September 2010


   The metro network is mainly composed of Core Routers, Aggregation
   Routers, and BRASs.  CR, as the egress router of the metro network,
   is connected to both IP backbone and MPLS backbone.  Most BRASs are
   connected directly to Core Routers, but a small portion of the BRASs
   in some large metro networks are connected to Core Routers via
   Aggregation Routers.

   The access network provides broadband access service for users.  It
   mainly includes layer 2 devices (e.g., DSLAM, Aggregation Switch).
   Broadband access service is provided over ADSL, LAN, PON and so on.
   In the access network, the IPv6 capability is limited due to some
   security considerations (IP-Based ACLs or policies).  The best part
   of UE access the network using the PPPOE dial up method.  So, hosts
   can acquire IPv6 address through PPPoE to avoid the problem.

   With respect to the terminals, the Windows(TM) OS dominates in the
   market, the Windows Vista and Windows 7 is the minority while the
   Windows XP is majority.  The WindowsXP cannot support IPv6 PPPOE.

   The situation of terminals in some developing countries, e.g.  China
   is somewhat different from the situation of terminals in Europe.  CPE
   can operates either in routed or in bridged mode.  The major part of
   existing Routed mode CPE cannot support IPv6 PPPOE dial up.  The
   bridged mode CPE allows the users to dial up from PCs.  CPE Home
   Gateways in some cases are purchased by the users themselves, which
   are unmanageable by the service provider.

   During the migration to IPv6, the transition strategies and
   technologies selection becomes one of the most significant issues due
   to the complexity of the network and the services, the large number
   of scenarios and the multiple methods of terminals and user access.
   However, there is no universally applicable solution or guideline for
   the migration of network and services to native IPv6 in the industry
   yet.  Each operator is looking for the appropriate transition
   strategy for itself.

   To investigate the impact of various transition technologies on
   network and services and select correct migration procedures.  A lot
   of experiments were conducted on its existing networks, covering the
   backbone network, metro network, terminals, service platforms, and
   the provisioning systems.

   In this document, several possible migration scenarios applicable to
   the typical network are introduced.  Related solutions for these
   scenarios are also introduced.

Internet-Draft         Broadband Network Use Case         September 2010


1.1.  Requirements Language

   This document is descriptive, and therefore contains no requirements
   language.


2.  Backbone Network Migration

   As stated in Section 1, there are usually two types of backbones: IP
   backbone and an MPLS backbone.  The migration solutions could be
   enabling 6PE in MPLS backbone, dual stack capability in IP backbone,
   and building up a new IPv6-only backbone network.

2.1.  Solution 1: 6PE in the MPLS Network

   MPLS backbone provides VPN service for the large scale enterprise
   customers.  When the whole network deploys MPLS, 6PE [rfc4798] can be
   used to provide IPv6 transmission.  The IPv6 routing information is
   marked with MPLS labels through IBGP and is distributed into IPv4/
   MPLS backbone network.  The communication of IPv6 is achieved by the
   LSP among PEs.  Using 6PE and implementing IPv4 and IPv6 protocol
   stack at the PE device connecting to IPv6 network, the original IPv4/
   MPLS network in the backbone network could be adopted to provide
   access capability for the distributed IPv6 only user.

2.2.  Solution 2: Dual Stack in the IP Network

   The device enables IPv4/IPv6 protocol stack at the same time.  IPv4
   and IPv6 routing are both in the routers which forward IPv4/IPv6
   packet separately based on the IPv4/IPv6 routing tables.

2.3.  Solution 3: Creating a IPv6-only Network

   Newly establish a native IPv6 network according to the scale of
   current backbone network.  The device enables IPv6 protocol stack
   only.  There is IPv6 routing only in the router which does not carry
   IPv4 traffic.


3.  Metro Network Migration

   The metro network here covers the network from BRAS to metro egress
   router.  Generally speaking, there are 4 mainstream programs.

3.1.  Solution 1

   The network is updated based on existing network.  In this solution,
   the Core Routers in the original metro network should be upgraded to



Huang, et al.             Expires April 1, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Broadband Network Use Case         September 2010


   dual stack.  Old BRASs that can be upgraded to dual stack are also
   upgraded; BRASs that cannot be upgraded remain as IPv4.  Newly added
   BRASs provide dual stack.

3.2.  Solution 2

   The network is updated based on existing network as well.  The
   approach is the same as solution 1 for existing equipments.  The
   difference from solution 1 is that newly added BRASs support IPv6
   only.

3.3.  Solution 3

   Creat a dual stack network.  The new Core Routers and BRASs are dual
   stack and provide a dual stack with no changes to the existing
   network.

3.4.  Solution 4

   Create an IPv6 network.  The new Core Routers and BRASs are IPv6 only
   with no changes to the existing network.  The IPv6 traffic flows over
   the new built network while the IPv4 traffic traverses the old one.


4.  Access Network Migration

   The access network covers the network from the user terminal to BRAS,
   usually including DSLAM, aggregation switch and so on.  The access
   network is usually a layer 2 network in this typical network, and can
   transmit IPv6 traffic transparently.  As mentioned above, the access
   network cannot carry IPv6 traffic directly due to some security
   considerations, but the user can acquire an IP address by PPPoE
   dial-up [RFC2516] which avoids the above problem.  Generally, there
   are 3 solutions for access network migration.

4.1.  Solution 1

   Modify the existing network and add new IPv6 aware access devices
   without changing the old devices.

4.2.  Solution 2

   Solution 2 is modifying the existing network and adding new IPv6
   aware access devices with upgrade or change to the old devices.

Internet-Draft         Broadband Network Use Case         September 2010


4.3.  Solution 3

   Create a new access network supporting IPv6.  The old network remains
   the same.  For the subscribers who have the requirement of IPv6, it
   is needed to cut them over to the new access network.


5.  User Access Migration

   The broadband subscribers acquire IP addresses from the BRAS through
   PPPoE to visit the Internet.  The possible approaches to address
   acquisition can be categorized as follows.

5.1.  Solution 1: Dual Stack subscribers access Dual Stack BRAS

   The subscribers acquire dual stack addresses from the BRAS in the
   following scenarios:

   1.  Scenario 1 of metro network migration

   2.  Old upgradable BRAS in scenario 2 of metro network migration

   3.  Scenario 3 of metro network migration.

   When not enough public IPv4 addresses are available, the BRAS
   allocates a private IPv4 address to the user, thus requiring a NAT44
   carrier grade NAT (CGN)device in the metro network.  The NAT44 CGN
   can be deployed at two locations based on the routing plan of metro
   network: centralized (collocated with the Core Router), or
   distributed (collocated with the BRAS).

5.2.  Solution 2: Dual Stack subscribers access IPv6-only BRAS

   The subscribers acquire dual stack addresses from an IPv6-only BRAS
   in the following scenarios:

   1.  Scenario 2 of metro network migration

       In this case, there are two methods to acquire IP addresses.  One
       is to create a L2TP tunnel from the IPv6-only BRAS to a dual
       stack BRAS which can allocate dual stack addresses for the user.
       Another way is to deploy a DS-Lite device in the metro network
       and CPE devices which can support DS-Lite
       [ID_softwire-dual-stack-lite].

   2.  Scenario 4 of metro network migration

       Deploy DS-Lite in the edge of metro network and provide DS-Lite



Huang, et al.             Expires April 1, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         Broadband Network Use Case         September 2010


       supported CPE to the user because the new Core Router and BRAS
       are both IPv6 only.

   In these two scenarios, NAT44 CGN device needs to be deployed in the
   metro network because the IPv4 addresses the user acquires are IPv4
   private addresses.

5.3.  Solution 3: Dual Stack subscribers access IPv4-only BRAS

   The subscribers acquire dual stack addresses from an IPv4-only BRAS
   in the following scenarios:

   1.  Scenario 1 and 2 of metro network migration

       Create a L2TP tunnel from the old BRAS (which could not be
       upgraded to dual stack) to the dual stack BRAS to acquire dual
       stack addresses, as above.  Another method is to deploy 6RD
       [RFC5969] gateway in the network and supply 6RD home gateway to
       the subscribers.

   2.  Scenario 3 and 4 of metro network migration

       Deploy 6RD in the old metro network and provide 6RD-supporting
       CPE to users served by the old BRAS to acquire dual stack
       address, since the old BRAS maintains IPv4 only.

5.4.  Solution 4: IPv6-only subscribers access IPv6-only BRAS

   The subscribers acquire an IPv6 address from an IPv6-only BRAS in the
   following scenarios:

   1.  Scenario 2 of metro network migration

       The user acquires an IPv6 address from the IPv6-only BRAS.  There
       are two ways to access the IPv4 Internet and communicate with
       IPv4 users.  We can deploy a protocol translation gateway in the
       old metro network.

   2.  Scenario 4 of metro network migration

       The user acquires IPv6 address from the IPv6 only BRAS.  We can
       deploy a protocol translation gateway in the new IPv6 only metro
       network and at the edge of the old metro network

6.  Internet Content Provider (ICP)	Migration

   Internet Content Provider (ICP) migration to IPv6 is the most
   important step to break the deadlock in the IPv6 industry chain.  The
   ICPs can migrate by themselves, or can be assisted by others.  For
   the transition of ICP itself, some ICPs have modified their
   proprietary web service.

6.1.  Provide NAT64 device at the IDC edge

   This solution requires a NAT64 [ID_behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] device
   deployed at the edge of IDC(Internet Data Center), but not requires
   to deploy a DNS64.  The solution could include the following steps:

   1.  Configure AAAA records with IPv6 addresses for the ICP's sites on
       its Authoritative DNS Server.  These IPv6 addresses are
       constituted by combining the ICP's IPv4 public address and an
       specific prefix according to the Prefix+v4 address style
       described in SIIT [RFC2765] or in IVI [ID_xli-behave-ivi].

   2.  When user initials an http request to the website, the host will
       query the corresponding IP address from DNS cache server which is
       usually located in Metro Network.

   3.  The DNS cache server replies with the ICP's IPv6 address in an
       AAAA record which is from the ICP's Authoritative DNS Server.  In
       some circumstances, these records could be configured in a
       centralized DNS server of the IDC.

   4.  The user will access the IPv4 services using the IPv6 address.
       The BRAS will route it to the NAT64 device located at the IDC
       edge, and remove the prefix, then translating the IPv6 client
       address by installing mappings in the normal NAT manner.


7.  Challenges Faced In Migrating To IPv6

   There is a long list of challenges during the transition from IPv4 to
   IPv6:

   o  The remaining stock of IPv4 addresses cannot support the
      development of existing services.  Future service's development is
      not the only thing which is concerned about, but the transition of
      existing services to IPv6 is also considered.

   o  Due to the long transition period, it will be highly possible that
      one thing taken into consideration while the other be neglected
      when the different parts of end-to-end network are migrated.  A

      balanced strategy is needed to guide the transition.

   o  Lack of IPv6 Internet resources.  ICP seldom deploy IPv6 and
      almost no Content Provider/Service Provider (CP/SP) considers IPv6
      when developing proprietary services due to the large volume of
      recoding.  The applications of ICPs are of various types and so
      complex that they cannot all support IPv6 in a short time.  In
      addition, many business websites are always linking to each other,
      creating a complex topology which will lead to many problems when
      one website migrates to IPv6 only.  Another reason ICP migration
      lacks motivation is that the CP/SP does not realize how urgent it
      is to migrate to IPv6.

   o  From the perspective of terminals, some specific terminals
      (e.g.,set top boxes) do not support IPv6 even if the main
      operating systems can do so.  Some operation systems for mobile
      terminals officially claimed they don't support IPv6.

   o  No accumulated experience with IPv6 transition.  Large scale
      network and large number of subscribers are the two key problems.
      IPv6 transition should be seriously considered.  With large scale
      network and various service platforms, the transition involves
      multiple levels and broad scope, so the cost of modification will
      be huge and the return on investment will not be so evident.  The
      selection of transition technology and network modification
      solution is not clear for the transition roadmap of the whole
      network.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


9.  Security Considerations

   The IETF is specifying security considerations for the tools that it
   is providing for IPv6 migration.  However, it is possible that
   additional considerations arise due to the interaction of these
   tools, and the fact that the network is in a transitional state.
   Security considerations should be incentive concerned about because
   of the potential loss, which is caused by the IPv6 security issues,
   e.g., dual-stack routing security, network expandability, device
   reliability, network anti-attack, user tracing, government
   supervision and etc.
