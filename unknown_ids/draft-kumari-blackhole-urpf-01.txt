Abstract

   Remote Triggered Black Hole (RTBH) filtering is a popular and effective
   technique for the mitigation of denial of service attacks. This document
   expands upon destination-based RTBH filtering by outlining a method to
   enable filtering by source address as well. It also defines a standard
   BGP community for black hole prefixes to simplify associated semantics.

1. Introduction

   This document expands upon the technique outlined in "Configuring BGP
   to Block Denial-of-Service Attacks" [RFC3882] and presents a method
   to allow filtering by source address. It also defines a standard BGP
   community to signal that Remote Triggered Black Hole (RTBH) filtering
   should occur for a network.

2. Background

   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that starve out legitimate traffic by
   saturating circuits are becoming an increasingly common occurrence.
   Network operators have developed a selection of techniques for
   mitigating these attacks. Different techniques have different
   strengths and weaknesses -- the selection of which technique to use
   for each type of attack involves tradeoffs.

   A common attack directed against a customer of a service provider
   involves generating more traffic at the customer than will fit down
   the links from the service provider to the customer. This traffic
   "starves out" legitimate traffic. Rather than having all of their
   network affected the customer may ask their service provider to
   filter traffic destined to the attacked IP address(es).

   One method that the service provider can use to implement this
   filtering is to deploy access control lists on the edge of their
   network, either manually or by using [FLOWSPEC]. While this technique
   provides a large amount of flexibility in the filtering, it runs into
   scalability issues, both in terms of the number of entries in the
   filter and the packet rate.

   Most routers are able to forward traffic at a much higher rate than
   they are able to filter, and are able to hold many more forwarding

   table entries and routes than filter entries. RTBH leverages the
   forwarding performance of modern routers to filter both more entries
   and at a higher rate than access control lists would allow.

   However, with destination-based RTBH filtering, the impact is that
   you effectively complete the attack.  That is, with destination-based
   RTBH filtering you inject a discard route into the forwarding table
   for the prefix in question. All packets towards that destination,
   attack traffic AND legitimate traffic, are then dropped by the
   participating routers, thereby taking the target completely offline.
   The benefit is that collateral damage to other systems or network
   availability at the customer location or in the ISP network is
   limited, but the negative impact to the target itself is arguably
   increased.

   By coupling unicast reverse path forwarding (RPF) [REF] techniques
   with RTBH, BGP can be used to distribute discard routes that are
   based not on destination or target addresses, but based on source
   addresses.

3. Destination address RTBH filtering

3.1. Overview

   A "discard" route is installed on each edge router in the  network
   with the destination set to be the discard (or null) interface. In
   order to use RTBH filtering for an IP address (or network) a BGP
   route for the address to be filtered is announced, with the next-hop
   set as the "discard" route. This causes traffic to the announced
   network to be forwarded to the discard interface and so it does not
   transit the network and waste resources or trigger collateral damage
   or negative impact to other resources along the path towards the
   target

   While this does "complete" the attack in that the attacked
   address(es) are made unreachable, it cuts down on collateral damage.
   It may also be possible to move the host / service on the attacked IP
   address(es) to another address and keep the service up.

3.2. Detail

   Steps to configure destination based RTBH filtering: 1: An address is
   chosen to become the "discard address". This is often chosen from
   192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET [RFC3330]), or from RFC 1918 [RFC1918] space.

   2: A route for the "discard address" is installed on the routers that
   form the edge/perimeter of the network, in all routers in the
   network, or some subset (e.g., peering, but not customer, etc.), with



Kumari                   Expires March 27, 2009                 [Page 3]

Internet Draft           blackhole-urpf-01.txt        September 27 2008


   the destination of the route being the "discard" or "null" interface.
   This route is called the "discard route".

   3: A BGP policy is configured on all routers that have the discard
   route so that routes announced with with the community [IANA - INSERT
   REGISTERED COMMUNITY HERE] will have their next hop set to the
   discard address.  The BGP policy should be made restrictive so that:
    - Only BGP routes covering a defined number of hosts addresses will
   be accepted.  That is, typically, only specific /32s are necessary,
   unless shorter prefix blocks are required.  This might occur where
   larger numbers of attacking sources are located within a single
   prefix, or the employment of this mechanism is to drop traffic to
   specific networks.  When filtering based on shorter prefixes, extreme
   caution should be used as to avoid collateral damage to legitimate
   hosts that reside within those address blocks.

   While administrators may choose to drop any prefixes they wish, it is
   recommended when employing source-based RTBH inter-domain that
   explicit policy be defined that enables peers to only announce
   source-based RTBH routes for prefixes which they originate.

   4: When RTBH filtering is desired for a specific address, that
   address is announced from a central router (or route server), tagged
   with the community [IANA - INSERT REGISTERED COMMUNITY HERE]. The
   receiving routers check the BGP policy, setting the next-hop to be
   the discard route, which resolves to the discard interface.

   5: Traffic entering the network will now be forwarded to the discard
   interface on all edge routers and so will be dropped at the edge of
   the network, saving resources.

   This technique can be expanded by having multiple discard addresses,
   routes and communities to allow for monitoring of the discarded
   traffic volume on devices that support multiple discard interfaces.

   The technique can also be expanded by relaxing the AS path rule to
   allow customers of a service provider to enable RTBH filtering
   without interacting with the service provider. If this is configured,
   an operator MUST only accept announcements for prefixes from the
   customer that the customer is authorized to advertise, to prevent the
   customer accidentally (or intentionally) black-holing space that is
   not theirs.

   A common policy for this type of setup would first permit any more
   specific of an authorized prefix only if the blackhole communities is
   attached, append NO_EXPORT, NO_ADVERTISE, or similar communities, and
   then also accept from the customer the original aggregate prefix that
   will be advertised to as standard policy permits.

   Extreme caution should be used in order to avoid leaking any more
   specifics beyond the local routing domain, unless policy explicitly
   aims at doing just that.

4. Source address RTBH filtering.

   In many instances the denial of service attacks are being sourced
   from botnets and are being configured to "follow DNS" (the attacking
   machines are instructed to attack www.example.com, and re-resolve
   this periodically. Historically the attacks were aimed simply at an
   IP address and so renumbering www.example.com to a new address was an
   effective mitigation). This makes a technique that allows black-
   holing based upon source address desirable.

   By combining traditional RTBH filtering with unicast Reverse Path
   Forwarding (uRPF [RFC3704]) a network operator can filter based upon
   source address. uRPF performs a route lookup of the source address of
   the packet and  checks to see if the ingress interface of the packet
   is a valid egress interface for the packet source address (strict
   mode) or if any route or the source address of the packet exists
   (loose mode).  If the check fails, the packet is (generally) dropped.
   In loose mode some vendors also verify that the destination route
   does not point to a discard interface - this allows source based RTBH
   filtering to be deployed in networks that cannot implement strict (or
   feasible path) mode uRPF.

   By enabling the uRPF feature on interfaces on pre-determined points
   of their network and announcing the source address(es) of attack
   traffic, a network operator can effectively drop the attack traffic
   at the edge of their network based on source addresses.

   Note: This will block all traffic sourced from the attacking
   addresses and may cause collateral damage that exceeds the benefit of
   this technique.  Announcing space (even within your own network) that
   you don't control is bad form -- the decision to use this technique
   should not be taken lightly.

4.1 Steps to deploy RTBH w/ uRPF for source filtering.

   The same steps that are required to implement destination address
   RTBH filtering are taken with the additional step of enabling unicast
   reverse path forwarding on predetermined interfaces. When a source
   address (or network) needs to be blocked, that address (or network)
   is announced using BGP tagged with a community. This will cause the
   route to be installed with a next hop of the  discard interface,
   causing the uRPF check to fail. The destination based RTBH filtering
   community ([IANA - INSERT REGISTERED COMMUNITY HERE]) should not be
   used for source based RTBH filtering, and the routes tagged with the

Internet Draft           blackhole-urpf-01.txt        September 27 2008


   selected community should be carefully filtered.

   The BGP policy will need to be relaxed to accept announcements tagged
   with this community to be accepted even though they contain addresses
   not controlled by the network announcing them. These announcements
   must NOT be propagated outside the current AS and should carry the
   no-export community.

   As a matter of policy, operators SHOULD NOT accept source-based RTBH
   announcements from their peers or customers, they should only be
   installed by local or attack management systems within their
   administrative domain.

5.  Security Considerations

   The techniques presented here provide enough power to cause severe
   unhappiness. It is imperative that the announcements that trigger the
   black-holing are carefully checked and that the BGP policy that
   accepts these announcements is implemented in such a manner that the
   announcements:
  - Are not propagated outside the AS (no-export).
  - Are not accepted from outside the AS (except from customers).
  - Except where source based filtering is deployed, that the network
  contained within the announcement falls with the address ranges
  controlled by the announcing AS (i.e.: for customer that the address
  falls within their space).

6.  IANA Considerations

  This document requests registration of a regular Type, non-transitive
  BGP Extended Communities Attribute [RFC4360] from the First Come,
  First Served range to be named "Remote Triggered Black Hole Filter".

  This community will provide a standard method to signal a provider
  that RTBH filtering should occur for a destination and will eliminate
  the need for customers to track different communities for each
  provider.
