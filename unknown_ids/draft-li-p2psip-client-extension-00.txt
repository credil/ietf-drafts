Internet-Draft           RELOAD Client Extension               July 2011


1.  Introduction

   RELOAD base draft [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] has defined the client
   behavior and two ways to route message to client.  SIP usage draft
   [I-D.ietf-p2psip-sip] defines how SIP application publishes and
   obtains the route to SIP user's node (peer or client).  However, some
   client related mechanisms are not described or detailed.  This draft
   describes the mechanisms of using multiple access peer and changing
   access peer.  This draft also proposes an additional way to route
   message to client.


2.  Multiple Access Peers

   To allow load sharing and avoid single point of failure, a client
   should use multiple access peers.  If a node (say node A) wants to
   send message to the client, it first obtains the client's access peer
   list via some kind of mechanism.  For example, the client stores its
   access peer list and node ID in the overlay using some kind of usage,
   and A fetches the list from overlay.  Then A sends message to next
   hop with destination list containing the client's node ID and a
   chosen access peer's node ID.

   The access peer in destination list may be chosen from access peer
   list randomly or based on some kind of criterion like the capacity of
   access peer, the distance to access peer's node ID, etc.  If a
   sending fails due to the failing of an access peer, A can choose
   another access peer's node ID to reconstruct destination list and
   send the message again.


3.  Direct Routing to Client

   If a client is publicly accessible, direct routing can be used to
   send message to the client.  To send messages to the client, A RELOAD
   node first obtains the client's IP address via some kind of
   mechanism.  For example, the client stores its IP address and node ID
   in the overlay using some kind of usage, and A fetches the list from
   overlay.  Then the node sends RELOAD messages to the client directly.


4.  Changing Access Peer

   A client MUST changing access peer happens if detects its current
   access peer fails.

   A client may change its access peer to a more desirable peer (e.g. a
   nearby access peer, a light loaded peer).  The changing may be

   initiated by the client or its access peer.  If it's initiated by
   access peer, access peer may use UPDATE method to notify the client.

   If access peer is determined by client's node ID, access peer would
   change when responsible peer of client's node ID changes.  If a
   client's access peer is no longer responsible for the client's node
   ID, access peer MUST notifies the client with UPDATE method.  Then
   the client attaches to the peer responsible for the client's node ID.


5.  Security Considerations

   TBD
