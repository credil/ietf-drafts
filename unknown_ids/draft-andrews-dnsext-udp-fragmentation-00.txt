Internet-Draft          DNS and UDP Fragmentation          December 2011


1.  Background

   IPv6 has changed the dynamics of UDP, Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) and
   IP fragmentation.  With IPv4 DNS/UDP packets were fragmented by the
   network and no PMTUD was performed.  With IPv6 fragmentation occurs
   in the sending node and PMTUD is alway performed unless the IPv6
   packet is fragmented by the sending node using the network MTU.

   DNS/UDP does not work well when PMTUD discover is performed.  If the
   Packet Too Big (PTB) / Need Fragmentation ICMP messages are not
   received there is no feedback path in DNS to reduce the size of the
   fragments like there is with TCP.

   Additionally there is no automatic retransmission of UDP packets like
   there is with TCP in response to a PTB message.  The sender needs to
   send the request after timing out.  Not only is this process slow,
   the resulting traffic patterns can be confused with other common
   sources of error, resulting from badly configured firewalls, leading
   to inappropriate remedial action being taken.

   This document recommends that all DNS/UDP messages are sent such that
   they do not trigger PMTUD.

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].


2.  IPv4 and Fragmentation

   There are a number of IP stacks that enable PMTUD for all IP packets
   by default against the advice of [RFC 1191].  On those IP stacks it
   is necessary for the application to disable PMTUD on a per socket/
   packet basis or for the operator to disable it globally if there is
   no per socket/packet control.


3.  IPv6 and Fragmentation

   It was realised that IPv6 changed the way PMTUD happened and that
   there were applications, like DNS, that would not work well with
   PMTUD.  For those applications a socket option called
   IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU was developed [RFC 3542] which tells the IPv6 stack
   to fragment packets at the network MTU rather than use PMTUD to find
   the actual PMTU.

   It is RECOMMENDED that IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU be set to 1 (one) when
   sending DNS/UDP messages over IPv6.  This option can be set at the
   socket level or it can be set on a per UDP datagram basis.

   If the IPv6 stack does not support IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU, then steps
   should be taken to prevent PMTUD occuring.  These include, but are
   not limited to, setting the interface the packets are being sent over
   should be set to the network MTU (1280 bytes), or restricing DNS/UDP
   packets to no more than 1280 bytes including IPv6 headers.

   It should be noted that even with IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU set to one that a
   PTB message may still be received [RFC 2460] which requires a IPv6 to
   add a Fragmentation header to subsequent packets.  There is currently
   no way to avoid this, without using raw sockets, as there is no way
   for a application to request that a Fragmentation header be added to
   a packet.


4.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA Considerations.


5.  Security Considerations

   Failure to prevent PMTUD can lead to denial of service for DNS
   clients.

   Firewalls are often configured to block fragmented IP packets as
   early IP stacks had fragmentation re-assembly bugs.  These bugs were
   exploited to perform a number of denial of service and other attacks
   cira 1999.

   Such blocks should be relaxed to permit fragmented UDP packets.
