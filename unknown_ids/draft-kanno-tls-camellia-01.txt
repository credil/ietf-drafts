Internet-Draft     Addition of Camellia cipher for TLS        April 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Camellia cipher suites are already spcified in RFC5932 [16] with
   SHA-256 based HMAC using asymmetric key encryption.  This document
   proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) [9] protocol to support the Camellia [4] cipher
   algorithm as a block cipher algorithm.  The proposed cipher suites
   include variants using SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash functions
   [14] and Galois counter mode (GCM) [15].  Elliptic curve cipher
   suites and Pre-Shared Key (PSK) [5] cipher suites are also included.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [3].

2.  Proposed Cipher Suites

2.1.  HMAC based Cipher Suites

   The eight cipher suites use Camellia [4] in Cipher Block Chaining
   (CBC) [4] mode with a SHA-2 family HMAC using elliptic curves
   cryptosystem:

   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256 = {TBD,TBD};
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384 = {TBD,TBD};
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256  = {TBD,TBD};
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384  = {TBD,TBD};
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256   = {TBD,TBD};
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384   = {TBD,TBD};
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256    = {TBD,TBD};
   CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384    = {TBD,TBD};

2.2.  GCM based Cipher Suites

   The twenty cipher suites use the same asymmetric key algorithms as
   those in the previous section but use the authenticated encryption
   modes defined in TLS 1.2 [9] with the Camellia in GCM [15].

  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256          = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384          = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256      = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384      = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256       = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384       = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256      = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384      = {TBD,TBD};

  CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384       = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256      = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384      = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256  = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384  = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256   = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384   = {TBD,TBD};
  CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256    = {TBD,TBD};

2.3.  PSK based Cipher Suites

   The fourteen cipher suites describe PSK cipher suites.  The first six
   cipher suites use Camellia with GCM and the next eight cipher suites
   use the Camellia with SHA-2 family HMAC using asymmetric key
   encryption or elliptic curves cryptosystem.

    CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256        = {TBD,TBD};

3.  Cipher Suite Definitions

3.1.  Key Exchange

   The RSA, DHE_RSA, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DH_DSS, ECDH, DH_anon, and ECDHE
   key exchanges are performed as defined in RFC5246 [9].

3.2.  Cipher

   The CAMELLIA_128_CBC cipher suites use Camellia [4] in CBC mode with
   a 128-bit key and 128-bit IV; the CAMELLIA_256_CBC cipher suites use
   a 256-bit key and 128-bit IV.

   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [20] authenticated encryption with
   additional data algorithms, AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM are
   described in RFC5116 [8].  And AES GCM cipher suites for TLS are
   described in RFC5288 [10].  AES and Camellia share common
   characteristics including key sizes and block length.
   CAMELLIA_128_GCM and CAMELLIA_256_GCM are defined according as those
   of AES.

3.3.  PRFs

   The hash algorithms and pseudorandom function (PRF) algorithms for
   TLS 1.2 [9] SHALL be as follows:

   a) The cipher suites ending with _SHA256 use HMAC-SHA-256 [1] as the
   MAC algorithm, The PRF is the TLS PRF [9] with SHA-256 [14] as the
   hash function,
   b) The cipher suites ending with _SHA384 use HMAC-SHA-384 [1] as the
   MAC algorithm, The PRF is the TLS PRF [9] with SHA-384 [14] as the
   hash function.

   When used with TLS versions prior to 1.2 ( TLS 1.0 [2] and TLS 1.1
   [6]), the PRF is calculated as specified in the appropriate version
   of the TLS specification.

3.4.  PSK cipher suites

   PSK cipher suites for TLS are described in RFC4279 [5], RFC4785 [7],
   RFC5487 [12], and RFC5489 [13].

4.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys for
   Camellia.  And no security problem has been found on Camellia (see
   NESSIE [17], CRYPTREC [18], and LNCS 5867[19]).

   The security considerations in previous RFCs (RFC4279 [5], RFC4785
   [7], RFC5116 [8], RFC5288 [10], RFC5289 [11], RFC5487 [12]), and GCM
   [15] apply to this document as well.
