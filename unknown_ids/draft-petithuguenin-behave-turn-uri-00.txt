Internet-Draft                  TURN URIs                     April 2008


1.  Introduction

   The TURN [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] specification defines a process for a
   TURN client to find TURN servers by using DNS SRV resource records,
   but this process does not let the TURN servers administrator
   provision the preferred TURN transport protocol between the client
   and the servers and for the TURN client to discover this preference.
   This document defines a S-NAPTR application [RFC3958] for this
   purpose.  This application defines RELAY as application service tag
   and turn.udp, turn.tcp and turn.tls as application protocol tags.

   To simplify the provisioning of TURN client, this document also
   defines a TURN and a TURNS URI and a resolution mechanism to convert
   this URIs into a list of IP addresses, ports and TURN transport
   protocols.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Syntax of a TURN or TURNS URI

   A TURN/TURNS URI has the following ABNF syntax [RFC5234]:

   turnURI   = scheme ":" host [ ":" port ] [ ";transport=" transport ]
   scheme    = "turn" / "turns"
   transport = "udp" / "tcp"

   The URI host and port components are specified in [RFC3986].


4.  TURN or TURNS URI Resolution

   The URI resolution algorithm uses the URI scheme, URI host, URI port
   and URI transport components as input.  It also uses a list ordered
   by preference of TURN transports (UDP, TCP, TLS) supported by the
   application using the TURN client.  The output of the algorithm is a
   list of IP address, port and transport tuples that a TURN client can
   try to contact a TURN server.

   First the resolution algorithm checks that the URI can be resolved
   with the list of TURN transports supported:

   o  If the URI scheme component is defined as turn and the URI
      transport component is defined as udp but the list of TURN
      transports does not contain UDP then the resolution MUST stop with
      an error.
   o  If the URI scheme component is defined as turn and the URI
      transport component is defined as tcp but the list of TURN
      transports does not contain TCP or TLS then the resolution MUST
      stop with an error.
   o  If the URI scheme component is defined as turns and the URI
      transport component is defined as udp then the algorithm MUST stop
      with an error.
   o  If the URI scheme component is defined as turns and the URI
      transport component is defined as tcp but the list of TURN
      transports does not contain TLS then the resolution MUST stop with
      an error.
   o  If the URI scheme component is defined as turns and the URI
      transport component is not defined but the list of TURN transports
      does not contain TLS then the resolution MUST stop with an error.

   Then the algorithm applies the following steps.  The resolution stops
   when a TURN client successfully contacts a TURN server.

   1.  If the URI host component is an IP address then it indicates the
       specific IP address to be used.  If the URI port component is not
       defined, the default port declared in [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] for
       the SRV service name defined in the URI scheme component is used.
       If the URI transport component is defined then the TURN UDP
       transport is used if the URI scheme component is turn and the URI
       transport component is udp, the TURN TCP transport is used if the
       URI scheme component is turn and the URI transport component is
       tcp and the TURN TLS transport is used if the URI scheme
       component is turns and the URI transport component is tcp.  If
       the URI transport component is not defined, the TURN transports
       supported by the application are tried by preference order.  If
       the TURN client cannot contact a TURN server with this IP address
       and port on any of the transports then the resolution MUST stop
       with an error.
   2.  If the URI host component is a domain name and the URI port
       component is defined, then the URI host component is resolved to
       a list of IP addresses via DNS A and AAAA queries.  If the URI
       transport component is defined then the TURN UDP transport is
       used if the URI scheme component is turn and the URI transport
       component is udp, the TURN TCP transport is used if the URI
       scheme component is turn and the URI transport component is tcp
       and the TURN TLS transport is used if the URI scheme component is
       turns and the URI transport component is tcp.  If the URI
       transport component is not defined, the TURN transports supported
       by the application are tried by preference order.  If the TURN

       client cannot contact a TURN server with this port and any
       combination of transports and resolved IP addresses then the
       resolution MUST stop with an error.
   3.  If the URI host component is a domain name and the URI port
       component is not defined but the URI transport component is
       defined then the URI host component is converted to a list of IP
       address and port tuples via a DNS SRV query as defined in
       [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] section 6.1.  The URI scheme component is
       used for the service name and the URI transport component is used
       for the protocol name in the SRV algorithm [RFC2782].  If the
       TURN client cannot contact a TURN server on any of the IP
       address, port and transport tuples returned by the SRV algorithm
       then the resolution MUST stop with an error.  If the DNS SRV
       query does not return any result, then the URI host component is
       converted to a list of IP addresses by using the default port
       declared in [I-D.ietf-behave-turn] for the SRV service name
       defined in the URI scheme component and step 2 of the resolution
       algorithm.
   4.  If the URI host component is a domain name and the URI port and
       transport components are not defined, then the URI host component
       is converted to an ordered list of IP address, port and transport
       tuples via the S-NAPTR algorithm defined in [RFC3958].  The
       Application Service Tag used is RELAY.  The TURN transports
       supported by the application are tried by preference order by
       using the turn.udp Application Protocol Tag if the TURN transport
       is UDP, the turn.tcp Application Protocol Tag if the TURN
       transport is TCP and the turn.tls Application Protocol Tag if the
       TURN transport is TLS.  If the TURN client cannot contact a TURN
       server with any of the IP address, port and transport tuples
       returned by the S-NAPTR algorithm then then the resolution MUST
       stop with an error.  If the first NAPTR SRV query does not return
       any result then the URI host component is converted to a list of
       IP address and port tuples by trying the TURN transports
       supported by the application by preference order and step 3 of
       the resolution algorithm.
