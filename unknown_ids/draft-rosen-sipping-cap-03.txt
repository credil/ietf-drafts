Internet-Draft                   SIP CAP                      March 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) [cap] is an XML document format
   for exchanging emergency alerts and public warnings.  This document
   allows CAP documents to be distributed via the event notification
   mechanism available with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

   Additionally, a MIME object is registered to allow CAP documents to
   be exchanged in other SIP documents.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  The 'common-alerting-protocol' Event Package

   RFC 3265 [RFC3265] defines a SIP extension for subscribing to remote
   nodes and receiving notifications of changes (events) in their
   states.  It leaves the definition of many aspects of these events to
   concrete extensions, known as event packages.  This document defines
   such an event package.  This section fills in the information
   required for all event packages by RFC 3265.

   Additionally, RFC 3903 [RFC3903] defines an extension that allows SIP
   User Agents to publish event state.  According to RFC 3903, any event
   package intended to be used in conjunction with the SIP PUBLISH
   method has to include a considerations section.  This section also
   fills the information for all event packages to be used with PUBLISH
   requests.

   This document defines a new "common-alerting-protocol" event package.
   Event Publication Agents (EPA) use PUBLISH requests to inform an
   Event State Compositor (ESC) of changes in the common-alerting-
   protocol event package.  Acting as a notifier, the ESC notifies
   subscribers about emergency alerts and public warnings.

3.1.  Package Name

   The name of this package is "common-alerting-protocol".  As specified
   in RFC 3265 [RFC3265], this value appears in the Event header field
   present in SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests.  As specified in RFC 3903
   [RFC3903], this value also appears in the Event header field present
   in PUBLISH requests.

Internet-Draft                   SIP CAP                      March 2009


3.2.  Event Package Parameters

   RFC 3265 [RFC3265] allows event packages to define additional
   parameters carried in the Event header field.  This event package,
   "common-alerting-protocol", does not define additional parameters.

3.3.  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   RFC 3265 [RFC3265] allows a SUBSCRIBE request to contain a body.
   This document allows the body to contain civic and geodetic location
   information to be carried.  The 2D location shapes listed in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile], e.g., <Point> <Polygon>,
   <Circle>, <Ellipse>, <ArcBand>, and a <civicAddress> element, defined
   in [RFC5139], in the body of the message.  The recipient of the
   SUBSCRIBE message SHOULD use this information to restrict the warning
   messages that are being delivered.  [Editor's note: Information about
   the type of alerts that shall be received may need to be indicated as
   well.]

3.4.  Subscription Duration

   The default expiration time for subscriptions within this package is
   3600 seconds.  As per RFC 3265 [RFC3265], the subscriber MAY specify
   an alternate expiration in the Expires header field.

3.5.  NOTIFY Bodies

   As described in RFC 3265 [RFC3265], the NOTIFY message will contain
   bodies describing the state of the subscribed resource.  This body is
   in a format listed in the Accept header field of the SUBSCRIBE
   request, or a package-specific default format if the Accept header
   field was omitted from the SUBSCRIBE request.

   In this event package, the body of the notification contains a Common
   Alerting Protocol (CAP) document, i.e., an XML document.  The format
   of the XML documents used by CAP are described in [cap].

   For an initial notify, unlike for other event packages, there is no
   current initial state, unless there's a pending alert.  Hence,
   returning a NOTIFY with a non-empty body only makes sense if there
   are indeed active alerts.

   All subscribers and notifiers of the "common-alerting-protocol" event
   package MUST support the "application/common-alerting-protocol+xml"
   data format.  The SUBSCRIBE request MAY contain an Accept header
   field.  If no such header field is present, it has a default value of
   "application/common-alerting-protocol+xml" (assuming that the Event
   header field contains a value of "common-alerting-protocol").  If the



Rosen, et al.           Expires September 8, 2009               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                   SIP CAP                      March 2009


   Accept header field is present, it MUST include "application/
   common-alerting-protocol+xml".

3.6.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   The contents of a CAP document contains public information.  Hence,
   providing CAP documents may not require authorization by subscribers.

3.7.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests

   RFC 3265 [RFC3265] details the formatting and structure of NOTIFY
   messages.  However, packages are mandated to provide detailed
   information on when to send a NOTIFY, how to compute the state of the
   resource, how to generate neutral or fake state information, and
   whether state information is complete or partial.  This section
   describes those details for the common-alerting-protocol event
   package.

   A notifier MAY send a NOTIFY at any time.  Typically, it will send
   one when an alert or early warning message is available.  The NOTIFY
   request contains a body containing one or multiple CAP document(s).
   The times at which the NOTIFY is sent for a particular subscriber,
   and the contents of the body within that notification, are subject to
   any rules specified by the authorization policy that governs the
   subscription.

   In the case of a pending subscription, when final authorization is
   determined, a NOTIFY can be sent.  If the result of the authorization
   decision was success, a NOTIFY SHOULD be sent and SHOULD contain a
   complete CAP document.  If the subscription is rejected, a NOTIFY MAY
   be sent.  As described in RFC 3265 [RFC3265], the Subscription-State
   header field indicates the state of the subscription.

   The body of the NOTIFY MUST be sent using one of the types listed in
   the Accept header field in the most recent SUBSCRIBE request, or
   using the type "application/common-alerting-protocol+xml" if no
   Accept header field was present.

   Notifiers will typically act as Event State Compositors (ESC) and
   thus will learn the 'common-alerting-protocol' event state via
   PUBLISH requests sent from authorized Event Publication Agents
   (EPAs).

3.8.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   RFC 3265 [RFC3265] leaves it to event packages to describe the
   process followed by the subscriber upon receipt of a NOTIFY request,
   including any logic required to form a coherent resource state.

Internet-Draft                   SIP CAP                      March 2009


3.9.  Handling of Forked Requests

   RFC 3265 [RFC3265] requires each package to describe handling of
   forked SUBSCRIBE requests.

   This specification only allows a single dialog to be constructed as a
   result of emitting an initial SUBSCRIBE request.

3.10.  Rate of Notifications

   RFC 3265 [RFC3265] requires each package to specify the maximum rate
   at which notifications can be sent.

   Notifiers SHOULD NOT generate notifications for a single user at a
   rate of more than once every five seconds.

3.11.  State Agents

   RFC 3265 [RFC3265] requires each package to consider the role of
   state agents in the package and, if they are used, to specify how
   authentication and authorization are done.  This specification allows
   state agents to be located in the network.

3.12.  Examples

   An example is provided in Section 4.

3.13.  Use of URIs to Retrieve State

   RFC 3265 [RFC3265] allows packages to use URIs to retrieve large
   state documents.

   CAP documents are fairly small.  This event package does not provide
   a mechanism to use URIs to retrieve large state documents.

3.14.  PUBLISH Bodies

   RFC 3903 [RFC3903] requires event packages to define the content
   types expected in PUBLISH requests.

   In this event package, the body of a PUBLISH request may contain a
   CAP document.  A CAP document describes an emergency alert or an
   early warning event.

   All EPAs and ESCs MUST support the "application/
   common-alerting-protocol+xml" data format and MAY support other
   formats.

Internet-Draft                   SIP CAP                      March 2009


   Note that this document does not mandate how CAP documents are made
   available to the Public Warning System, for example by authorities or
   similar organizations.  The PUBLISH mechanism is one way.

3.15.  PUBLISH Response Bodies

   This specification assumes that a PUBLISH also conveys a CAP document
   that is later sent further on to watchers.

3.16.  Multiple Sources for Event State

   RFC 3903 [RFC3903] requires event packages to specify whether
   multiple sources can contribute to the event state view at the ESC.

   This event package allows different EPAs to publish CAP documents for
   a particular user.  The concept of composition is not applicable for
   this application usage.

3.17.  Event State Segmentation

   RFC 3903 [RFC3903] defines segments within a state document.  Each
   segment is defined as one of potentially many identifiable sections
   in the published event state.

   This event package defines does not differentiate between different
   segments.

3.18.  Rate of Publication

   RFC 3903 [RFC3903] allows event packages to define their own rate of
   publication.

   There are no rate-limiting recommendations for common-alerting-
   protocol publication.  Since emergency alerts and early warning
   events are typically rare there is no periodicity, nor a minimum or
   maximum rate of publication.


4.  Examples

   Here is an example of a CAP document.

5.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses security considerations when using SIP to
   distribute warning messages using CAP.

Internet-Draft                   SIP CAP                      March 2009


5.1.  Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

   Threat:

      The attacker could then conceivably attempt to impersonate the
      subject (the putative caller) to some SIP-based target entity.

   Countermeasures:

      Such an attack is implausible for several reasons.  The subject's
      assertion:
      *  should be signed, thus causing any alterations to break its
         integrity and make such alterations detectable.
      *  the intended recipients may be listed in the optionally present
         audience restriction, which is a cleartext field.  As such, it
         would not allow automatic processing but could give the
         receiving user further hints.
      *  Issuer is represented in the CAP document (in the <sender>
         element).
      *  validity period for the CAP document may be restricted.

5.2.  Forgery

   Threat:

      A malicious user could forge or alter a CAP document in order to
      convey messages to SIP entities that get immediate attention of
      users.

   Countermeasures:

      To avoid this kind of attack, the entities must assure that proper
      mechanisms for protecting the CAP documents are employed, e.g.,
      signing the CAP document itself.  Section 3.3.2.1 of [cap]
      specifies the signing of CAP documents.

5.3.  Replay Attack

   Threat:

      Theft of CAP documents described in this document and replay of it
      at a later time.

   Countermeasures:

      A CAP document contains the mandatory <identifier>, <sender>,
      <sent> elements and an optional <expire> element.  These
      attributes make the CAP document unique for a specific sender and



Rosen, et al.           Expires September 8, 2009               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                   SIP CAP                      March 2009


      provide time restrictions.  An entity that has received a CAP
      message already within the indicated timeframe is able to detect a
      replayed message and, if the content of that message is unchanged,
      then no additional security vulnerability is created.  Nodes that
      enter the area of a disaster after the initial distribution of
      warnings have not yet seen the CAP message and, as such, would not
      be able to distinguish a replay from the initial message being
      sent around.  However, if the threat that lead to the distribution
      of warning messages is still imminent then there is no reason not
      to worry about that message.  The source distributing the early
      warning messages is, however, adviced to carefully select a value
      for the <expires> element and it is RECOMMENDED to set this
      element.

5.4.  Unauthorized Distribution

   Threat:

      When an entity receives a CAP message it has to determine whether
      the entity distributing the CAP messages is genuine to avoid
      accepting messages that are injected by malicious users with the
      potential desire to at least get the users immediate attention.

   Countermeasures:

      When receiving a CAP document a couple of verification steps must
      be performed.  First, it needs to be ensured that the message was
      delivered via a trusted entitiy (such as a trusted SIP proxy) and
      that the communication channel between the User Agent and it's SIP
      proxy is properly secured to exclude various attacks at the SIP
      level.  Then, the message contains the <sender> that may contain
      an entity that falls within the white list of the entity receiving
      the message.  Finally, the message is protected by a digital
      signature and the entity signing the CAP message may again be
      listed in a white list of the receiving entity and may therefore
      be trusted.  If none of these verification checks lead to a
      positive indication of a known sender then the CAP document should
      be treated as suspicious and configuration at the receiving entity
      may dictate how to process and display CAP documents in such a
      case.
