Abstract

   This document tries to speculate how policy conflicts happen, and how
   to address the conflicts.  After making it clear what kind of address
   selection policy should be necessary, we proposed how to merge the
   possibily conflicting policies for each of the destination address
   selection policy and source address selection policy.

Internet-Draft     Address-Selection Poloicy Conflict       October 2009


1.  Introduction

   RFC 5220 [RFC5220] describes several cases that have problems caused
   by using multiple prefixes at hosts and sites.  The address selection
   design team is working on this issue and summarizes their work in the
   considerations document [I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-considerations].
   Their solution mechanism is going to be an update mechanism of the
   address selection policy table at a host from the network.  A new
   DHCPv6 option [I-D.fujisaki-dhc-addr-select-opt] is proposed for this
   purpose.

   As mentioned in RFC 5220 [RFC5220], a host and a site can belong to
   multiple upstream networks.  For example, a host with multiple
   interfaces, such as wireless and wired interfaces, can easily belong
   to multiple networks.  A site may have connectivity to ISP and a
   corporate network through a VPN link.

   In these cases, if two or more of the upstream networks want to
   control address selection behavior of his network's customer host,
   those address selection policies have to be merged at the host, and
   they may collide there.

   This document tries to speculate how policy conflicts happen, and how
   to address the conflicts.  Moreover, this document also tries to
   examine a mechanism for solving conflicts in the section of
   cenceptual processing model.  This document focuses on identifying
   what kind of conflict related problems we have, and in what kind of
   manner we can solve them.

   Some of the problems described in RFC 5220 are specific to and
   resulted from the address selection mechanism defined in RFC 3484.
   [RFC3484] However, above mentioned policy collision is an intrinsic
   problem of address selection policy merging, and not specific to the
   RFC 3484 mechanism.


2.  Address Selection Control

   As in RFC 5220, there are various motivations for network
   administrator to control address selection behavior of his customers'
   hosts.  However, we can summarize them into two following kinds of
   controls.

   - Source address selection behavior control:

Internet-Draft     Address-Selection Poloicy Conflict       October 2009


      "When accessing to PREFIX-1, use ADDRESS-1 as the source address."
      A lot of ISPs have this policy and they usually implement it by
      adopting ingress filtering to incoming packets from their
      customers.  Another case where this policy is used is a network
      that makes use of multiple address blocks in the network and
      assigns multiple addresses/prefixes to its customers and use them
      for different purpose, such as the Internet access use and
      telephone call use.

   - Destination address selection behavior control:

      "When accessing to PREFIX-1 or PREFIX-2, prefer PREFIX-1 rather
      than PREFIX-2."  This control is rather intended for optimization
      of the customers' traffic.  This kind of control is not intended
      for on-off switch, but rather a preference degree.  For example,
      this is useful when a destination site has both PREFIX-1 and
      PREFIX-2, and the network administrator knows connectivity to
      PREFIX-1 is better than PREFIX-2.  The typical case of this is
      IPv4 and IPv6 prioritization as mentioned in RFC 5220.

      On-off switch manner of control is not in scope of address
      selection behavior, but it should be implemented some other
      mechanism, such as routing table manipulation and DNS resolution.

      As this is intrinsiclly intended for optimization, it should not
      be used for any other purpose like security .

   Here, PREFIX-* is used to denote both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes.  In the
   following part, policy conflict and solution for these two patterns
   above are examined separately.


3.  Source Address Selection Conflicts and Solution

   As mentioned above, source address selection policy have following
   meaning: "When accessing to PREFIX-1, use ADDRESS-1 as the source
   address."  The upstream network that has this kind of policy usually
   assigns an address block that includes ADDRESS-1, and also provides
   reachability to the network that is specified by PREFIX-1.

   Source address selection policy conflict can happen when different
   network have a policy for the same prefix.  For example, in the
   following figure, Network-1 have a policy: "To PREFIX-1, use
   ADDRESS-1", and Network-2: "To PREFIX-1 and PREFIX-2, use ADDRESS-2".

Internet-Draft     Address-Selection Poloicy Conflict       October 2009


                    PREFIX-1 -----+    PREFIX-2
                          |        \     |
                          |         \    |
                    +-----+-----+  +-+---+-----+
                    | Network-1 |  | Network-2 |
                    +------+----+  +----+------+
                            \          /
                             \        /
                    ADDRESS-1 \      / ADDRESS-2
                           +---+----+---+
                           | Host/Site  |
                           +------------+

   In this case, the solution is straightforward.  The destination
   address is determined before source address selection policy is used.
   Thus, the outgoing route, such as the next-hop node and the network
   interface, is determined by looking up the routing table at a host.
   That is, the outgoing network that carries the packet to the
   destination is determined without the source address selection
   policy.

   So, the bottom line is that the source address selection policy that
   matches routing table's behavior should be chosen.  There is no point
   adopting the source address selection policy of a network where a
   packet does not go through.

   In other words, if the routing table is fixed before the source
   address selection policy is fixed, then the source address selection
   policy should be implemented while avoiding contradiction with the
   routing table.  If not, the routing table should be coordinated to
   match the source address selection policy.

   In a case where a site is connected to the multiple ISPs, like the
   figure above, and receives policies from the ISPs and re-distribute
   policies to the downstream hosts, the hosts cannot know which ISP are
   chosen for transit to PREFIX-1.  So, in this case, the entity who
   knows which way is chosen have to address the policy conflict.


4.  Destination Address Selection Conflicts and Solution

   As mentioned in section 2, destination address selection policy have
   following meaning: "When accessing to a destination site that has
   PREFIX-1 and PREFIX-2, prefer PREFIX-1 rather than PREFIX-2."  The
   upstream network that has this kind of policy should provides
   reachability to both networks that are specified by PREFIX-1 and
   PREFIX-2.

Internet-Draft     Address-Selection Poloicy Conflict       October 2009


   Destination address selection policy conflict can happen when a
   network has a policy that has inverse effect of another network's
   policy.  That is, in the figure below, Network-1 prefers PREFIX-1
   rather than PREFIX-2, and Network-2 prefers PREFIX-2 rather than
   PREFIX-1.


                             bad   bad
                    PREFIX-1 ---- ---- PREFIX-2
                          |      X      |
                     good |     / \     | good
                    +-----+-----+ +-----+-----+
                    | Network-1 | | Network-2 |
                    +------+----+ +----+------+
                            \         /
                             \       /
                    ADDRESS-1 \     / ADDRESS-2
                           +---+---+---+
                           | Host/Site |
                           +-----------+

   In routing mechanism, a router advertises a route A to a certain
   destination, another advertises a route B to the same destination,
   and the receiver decides which route to take by looking at the cost
   of the routes and other information.

   In destination address selection policy, a network advertises prefix
   A and the precedence degree.  The destination address selection
   policy conflict happens when multiple entities provide policies for
   the same or the overlapping destination prefix with different costs.
   This is the same situation as the routing mechanism in that there can
   be multiple "routes" for the same destination.

   Here, we can choose the better, that is, higher precedence "route"
   for the destination prefix, but there is no point if the route is not
   actually used by the routing mechainism.  Even if we choose a policy
   for prefix A provided from Network-1, a packet destined for the
   prefix A does not always go through Network-1.  This is what the
   routing mechianism of the host or the site router decides.

   So, we propose to adopt the policy that is provided from the network
   the routing mechanism selected and thus a packet goes through,
   because the routing mechanism is already there and performs routing
   decisions by making use of the routing protocols metrics and also
   implementation dependent information.

   For example, Network-1 router advertises the following policy to the
   customers:

Internet-Draft     Address-Selection Poloicy Conflict       October 2009


      to PREFIX-1, precedence 20
      to PREFIX-2, precedence 10

   Network-2 advertises:
      to PREFIX-1, precedence 30
      to PREFIX-2, precedence 40

   And when the routing table is:
      PREFIX-1 via Network-1
      PREFIX-2 via Network-2

   Then, the receiving host should have the following merged destination
   address selection policy:
      to PREFIX-1, precedence 20 via Network-1
      to PREFIX-2, precedence 40 via Network-2


5.  Cenceptual Message Processing Model

   The merging process described here does not demand any modification
   to the address selection mechanism defined in RFC 3484.  However, the
   policy receiver has to keep multiple sets of the received policy as
   they are somewhere other than the policy table defined in RFC 3484.
   Also, the default policy table define in RFC 3484 has to be kept.

   The merging process retrieves all the above stored sets of policy,
   processes them, and put the merged policy into the policy table.
   This process should be performed every time the received policy
   changes.

   The default priority should be defined which to prioritize the
   default policy table or the received policy, or possibly the manually
   configured policy on the host.  The priority should also be
   configurable.

5.1.  Source Address Selection Policy

                          |         \    |
                    +-----+-----+ +--+---+----+

                            \          /
                             \        /
              2001:db8:1::/64 \      / 2001:db8:2::/64
                           +---+----+---+
                           |    Host    |
                           +------------+

   When these two ISPs, Network-1 and Network-2, provide the source
   address selection policy below,

   Network-1 "if dst ::/0, then src 2001:db8:1::/64"
   Network-2 "if dst ::/0 or fd00:2::/48, then src 2001:db8:2::/64"

   and when the Host's routing table looks like below,


                   Prefix              Nexthop
                   ::/0                Network-1
                   fd00:2::/48         Network-2

   as mentioned in the previous section, the policy that came from the
   selected entity in the routing table should be selected in the policy
   table also.  In this case, the routing table selected Network-1 for
   the nexthop for the prefix ::/0, so the Network-1's policy should be
   selected in the policy table.


                   Prefix        Precedence Label
                   ::/0                   ?     1
                   2001:db8:1::/64        ?     1
                   fd00:2::/48            ?     5
                   2001:db8:2::/64        ?     5

   If we consider about the merging with the default policy table, which
   is pasted below from the RFC 3484,


                   Prefix        Precedence Label
                   ::1/128               50     0
                   ::/0                  40     1
                   2002::/16             30     2
                   ::/96                 20     3

                   ::ffff:0:0/96         10     4

   We can have the following merged table.


                   Prefix        Precedence Label
                   ::1/128               50     0
                   ::/0                  40     1
                 * 2001:db8:1::/64       40     1
                 * fd00:2::/48           40     5
                 * 2001:db8:2::/64       40     5
                   2002::/16             30     2
                   ::/96                 20     3
                   ::ffff:0:0/96         10     4

   Here, the merging process was used that chooses the most harmless
   Precedence value.  That means, the Precedence value that does not
   spoil or change the other policy table entries' effects.

   The process is to find a prefix that includes or overlaps with the
   inserting entry in the default policy table, and to use the
   Precedence value of the prefix.  In this example, the prefix 2001:
   db8:1::/64 longestly matches with the existing prefix ::/0, so the
   Precedence value 40 was used for the merged entries.

                   ::ffff:0:0/96       Network-2

   Here, the merging process selects the Precedence value of the policy
   that is selected in the routing table.  That is, the routing table
   above selects Network-1 for the prefix ::/0, so the Precedence value
   for the prefix ::/0 should be the value of the Network-1's policy.
   The resulf of this merging process is below.


                   Prefix        Precedence Label
                   ::/0                  20     ?
                   ::ffff:0:0/96         40     ?

   If we consider about the merging with the default policy table,

   the merged policy table is going to be


                   Prefix        Precedence Label
                   ::1/128               50     0
                 * ::/0                  20     1
                   2002::/16             30     2
                   ::/96                 20     3
                 * ::ffff:0:0/96         40     4

   by adopting almost the same process as the source address policy
   merging.  That is, the merging process was used that chooses the most
   harmless Label value.  The Label value should be used that does not
   spoil or change the other policy table entries' effects.  It seems to
   be harmless to use the same Label value as the existing entry that
   longestly matches the inserting entry's prefix.


6.  Discussion

   In this document, we examined and classified address selection
   policies.  For each class, we proposed how to solve the merging
   conflicting policies.

   As documented here, the merging process has close relationship with
   the routing table.  It should be noted that the address selection
   policy distribution has to be considered and used along with the
   routing mechanism.
