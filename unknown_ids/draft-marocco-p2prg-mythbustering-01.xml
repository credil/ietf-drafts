    <t>
      Peer-to-peer traffic optimization techniques that aim at
      improving locality in the peer selection process have attracted
      great interest in the research community and have been subject
      of much discussion.  Some of this discussion has produced
      controversial myths, some rooted in reality while others remain
      unfounded. This document evaluates the most prominent myths
      attributed to P2P optimization techniques by referencing the
      most relevant study (or studies) that have addressed facts
      pertaining to the myth. Using these studies, we hope to either
      confirm or refute each specific myth.

  <section title='Introduction'>
    <t>
      Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications used for file-sharing, streaming
      and realtime communications exchange large amounts of data in
      connections established among the peers themselves and are
      responsible for an important part of the Internet traffic.
      Since applications have generally no knowledge of the underlying
      network topology, the traffic they generate is frequent cause of
      congestions in inter-domain links and significantly contributes
      to the raising of transit costs paid by network operators and
      Internet Service Providers (ISP).
    </t>
    <t>
      One approach to reduce congestions and transit costs caused by
      P2P applications consists of enhancing the peer selection
      process with the introduction of proximity information.  This
      allows the peers to identify the topologically closer resource
      among all the instances of the resources they are looking for.
      Several solutions following such an approach have recently been
      proposed <xref target='Choffnes'/> <xref target='Aggarwal'/>
      <xref target='Xie'/>, some of which are now being considered for
      standardization in the IETF <xref target='ALTO'/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      Despite extensive research based on simulations and field
      trials, it is hard to predict how proposed solutions would
      perform in a real-world systems made of millions of peers.  For
      this reason, possible effects and side-effects of optimization
      techniques based on P2P traffic localization have been a matter
      of frequent debate.  This document describes some of the most
      interesting effects, referencing relevant studies which have
      addressed them and trying to determine whether and in what
      measure they are likely to happen.
    </t>
    <t>
      Each possible effect -- or Myth -- is examined in three phases:

      <list style='symbols'>
        <t>
          Facts: in which a list of relevant data is presented,
          usually collected from simulations or field trials;

        <t>
          Discussion: in which the reasons for and against the myth
          are discussed based on the facts previously listed;
        </t>

          measure of the plausibility of the myth.

      </list>
    </t>
    <t>
      This document at the current stage is little more than a
      strawman.  With the help of the IRTF community, the authors
      would like to improve it, in the number of the Facts, in the
      quality of the Discussion and, particularly, in the

  <section title='Definitions'>
    <t>
      Terminology defined in <xref
      target='I-D.ietf-alto-problem-statement'/> is reused here; other
      definitions should be consistent with it.
    </t>
    <section title='Seeder'>
      <t>
        A peer that has a complete copy of the content it is sharing,
        and still offers it for upload. The term "seeder" is adopted
        from BitTorrent terminology and is used in this document to
        indicate upload-only peers also in other kinds of P2P
        applications.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Leecher'>
      <t>
        A peer that has not yet completed the download of a specific
        content (but usually has already started offering for upload
        the part it is in possession of). The term "leecher" is
        adopted from BitTorrent terminology and is used in this
        document to indicate peers that are both uploading and
        downloading, also in other kinds of P2P applications.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Swarm'>
      <t>
        The group of peers that are uploading and/or downloading
        pieces of the same content.  The term "swarm" is commonly used
        in BitTorrent, to indicate all seeders and leechers exchanging
        chuncks of a particular file; however, in this document it is
        used more generally, for example, in the case of P2P streaming
        applications, to refer to all peers receiving and/or
        transmitting the same media stream.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Tit-for-tat'>
      <t>
        A content exchange strategy where the amount of data sent by a
        leecher to another leecher is roughly equal to the amount of
        data received from it.  P2P applications, most notably
        BitTorrent, adopt such an approach to maximize resources
        shared by the users.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Surplus Mode'>
      <t>
        The status of a swarm where the number of seeders is
        significantly greater than the number of leechers (i.e. the
        total download demand is abundantly satisfied by the upload
        capacity).
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Transit'>
      <t>
        The service through which a network can exchange IP packets
        with all other networks it is not directly connected to. The
        transit service is always regulated by a contract, according
        to which the custumer (i.e. a network operator or an ISP) pays
        the transit provider per amount of data exchanged.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Peering'>
      <t>
        The direct interconnection between two separate networks for
        the purpose of exchanging traffic without recurring to a
        transit provider. Peering is usually regulated by agreements
        taking in account the amount of traffic generated by each
        party in each direction.
      </t>
    </section>
<!--
    <section title='Backhaul'>

      Ostensibly, the increase in application performance is the main
      reason for the consideration of P2P traffic localization
      techniques in academia and industry.  The expected increase
      depends on the specific application: file sharing applications
      witness an increase in the download rate, realtime communication
      applications observe lower delay and jitter, and streaming

        It seems that traffic localization techniques often cause an
        improvement in application performance.  However, it must be
        noted that such beneficial effects heavily depend on the
        network infrastructures.  In some cases, for example in
        networks with relatively low uplink bandwidth, localization
        seems to be useless if not harmful.  Also, beneficial effects
        depend on the swarm size; imposing locality when only a small
        set of local peers are available may even decrease download
        performance for local peers.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Conclusions'>
      <t>
        Very likely, especially for large swarms and in networks with

  <section title='Myth: Increased Uplink Bandwidth Usage'>
    <t>
      The increase in uplink bandwidth usage would be a negative
      effect, especially in environments where the access network is
      based on technologies providing asymmetric upstream/downstream
      bandwidth (e.g. DSL or DOCSIS).

        Mathematically, average uplink traffic remains the same as
        long as the swarm is not in surplus mode. However, in some
        particular cases where surplus capacity is available,
        localization may lead to local low-bandwiwth leechers
        connecting to each other instead of trying the external
        seeders. Even if such a phenomenon has not been observed in
        simulations and field trials, it could occur to applications
        that use localization as the only means for optimization when
        some content becomes popular in different areas at different
        times (as is the case of prime time TV shows distributed on
        BitTorrent networks minutes after getting aired in North
        America).

  <section title='Myth: Impacts on Peering Agreements'>
    <t>
      Peering agreements are usually established on a reciprocity
      basis, assuming that the amount of data sent and received by
      each party is roughly the same (or, in case of asymmetric
      traffic volumes, a compensation fee is paid by the party which
      would otherwise obtain the most gain). P2P traffic localization
      techniques aim at reducing cross-domain traffic and thus might
      also impact peering agreements.
    </t>

    <section title='Facts'>
      <t>
        No significant publications, simulations or trials have tried
        to understand how traffic localization techniques can
        influence factors that rule how peering agreements are
        established and maintained.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Discussion'>
      <t>
        This is a key topic for network operators and ISPs, and
        certainly deserves to be analyzed more accurately. Some random
        thoughts follow.
      </t>
      <t>
        It seems reasonable to expect different effects depending on
        the kinds of agreements. For example:

        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            ISPs with different customer bases: the ISP whose
            customers generate more P2P traffic can achieve a greater
            reduction of cross-domain traffic and thus could probably
            be in a position to re-negotiate the contract ruling the
            peering agreement;
          </t>
          <t>
            ISPs with similar customer bases:

            <list style='symbols'>
              <t>
                ISPs with different access technologies: customers of
                the ISP which provides higher bandwidth -- and, in
                particular, higher uplink bandwidth -- will have more
                incentives for keeping their P2P traffic
                local. Consequently, the ISP with a better
                infrastructure will be able to achieve a greater
                reduction in cross-domain traffic and will be probably
                in a position to re-negotiate the peering agreement;
              </t>
              <t>
                ISPs with similar access technologies: both ISPs would
                achieve roughly the same reduction in cross-domain
                traffic and thus the conditions under which the
                peering agreement had been established would not
                change much.
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        As a consequence of the reasoning above, it seems reasonable
        to expect that the simple fact that one ISP starts localizing
        its P2P traffic will be a strong incentive for the ISPs it
        peers with to do that as well.
      </t>
      <t>
        It's worth noting that traffic manipulation techniques have
        been reportedly used by ISPs to obtain peering agreements
        <xref target='Norton'/> with larger ISPs. One of the most used
        technique involves injecting forged traffic into the target
        ISP's network, in order to increase its transit costs. Such a
        techniques aims at increasing the relevance of the source ISP
        in the target's transit bill and thus motivate the latter to
        sign a peering agreement. However, traffic injection is
        exclusively unidirectional and easy to detect. On the other
        hand, if a localization-like service were used to direct P2P
        requests toward the target network, the resulting traffic
        would appear fully legitimate and, since in popular
        applications that follow the tit-for-tat approach peers tend
        to upload to the peers they download from, in many cases also
        bi-directional.

    </section>

  </section>

  <section title='Myth: Impacts on Transit'>
    <t>
      One of the main goals of P2P traffic localization techniques is
      to allow ISPs to keep local a part of the traffic generated by
      their customers and thus save on transit costs. However, similar
      techniques based on de-localization rather than localization may
      be used by those ISP that are also transit providers to
      artificially increase the amount of data exchanged with networks
      they provide transit to (i.e. pushing the peers run by their
      customers to establish connections with peers in the networks
      that pay them for transit).
    </t>

    <section title='Facts'>
      <t>
        No significant publications, simulations or trials have tried

        dynamics of transit provision economics.

    </section>

    <section title='Discussion'>
      <t>
        It is actually very hard to predict how the economics of
        transit provision would be affected by the tricks some transit
        providers could play on their customers making use of P2P
        traffic localization -- or, in this particular case,
        de-localization -- techniques. This is also a key topic for
        ISPs, definitely worth an accurate investigation.

        Probably, the only lesson contentions concerning transit and
        peering agreement have teached so far <xref

        that, at the end of the day, no economic factor, no matter how

      <t>
        It seems reasonable to expect that excessive traffic
        localization will cause some degree of deterioration in P2P
        swarms based on the tit-for-tat approach, and the damages of
        such deterioration will likely affect most users in networks
        with lower density of peers.  However, as shown in <xref
        target='LeBlond'/>, the right balance of randomness and
        locality depends on the P2P algorithm.
      </t>
      <t>
        On the other hand, P2P systems not adopting the tit-for-tat
        approach (e.g. the eDonkey network) should not be damaged by
        locality-based optimizations.

  <section title='Myth: Improved P2P Caching'>
    <t>
      P2P caching has been proposed as a possible solution to reduce
      cross-domain as well as uplink P2P traffic. Since the cache
      servers ultimately act as seeders, a cache-aware localization
      service would allow a seamless integration of a caching
      infrastructure with P2P applications <xref

        P2P Caching may be beneficial for both ISPs and network users,
        and locality-based optimizations may help the ISP to direct
        the peers towards caches.
