Abstract 

   This document describes the requirements for using the Generic 
   Associated Channel Label (GAL) in Pseudowires (PWs) in MPLS-TP 
   networks, and provides an update to the description of GAL usage in 
   [RFC5586] by removing the restriction that is imposed on using GAL 
   for PWs especially in MPLS-TP environments.

1. Introduction 

   [RFC5586] generalizes the associated control channel mechanism of 
   [RFC5085] to be used for Sections, Label Switched Paths (LSPs), and 
   Pseudowires (PWs) in MPLS networks. [RFC5085] defines the Associated 
   Channel Header (ACH), and [RFC5586] generalizes this for use in the 
   Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh).  

   [RFC5586] defines a generalized label-based exception mechanism using 
   the Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) to work together with the 
   ACH for use with LSPs but places restrictions on GAL usage with PWs.  

   This document removes the restriction imposed by [RFC5586].

3. GAL Usage for MPLS-TP PW  

   According to the MPLS-TP requirement document [RFC5654], it is 
   necessary that MPLS-TP mechanisms and capabilities be able to 
   interoperate with the existing IETF MPLS [RFC3031] and IETF PWE3 
   [RFC3985] architectures appropriate. [RFC5586] differentiates between 
   the usage of the GAL with PWs in MPLS and MPLS-TP environments in 
   section 4.2 as follows:  

       In MPLS-TP, the GAL MUST be used with packets on a G-ACh on LSPs, 
       Concatenated Segments of LSPs, and with Sections, and MUST NOT be 
       used with PWs. 

   This indicates that the GAL can be used for MPLS-TP LSPs and Sections, 
   but not for PWs using an MPLS-TP PSN. 

   However, there is no restriction imposed on the usage of the GAL in 
   MPLS PWs, which is described immediately afterwards in the same 
   section of [RFC5586] (Section 4.2): 

       However, in other MPLS environments, this document places no 
       restrictions on where the GAL may appear within the label stack 
       or its use with PWs. 

   The inconsistency between the usage of the GAL with MPLS PWs and 
   MPLS-TP PWs may cause unnecessary implementation differences and is 
   in disagreement with the MPLS-TP requirements.

Internet-Draft         Using GAL in MPLS-TP PW            November 2010 
    

   Therefore, this document specifies that the GAL can be used with 
   packets on a G-ACh on LSPs, Concatenated Segments of LSPs, Sections, 
   and PWs in both MPLS and MPLS-TP environments without discrimination.  

   [RFC5586] is updated by removing the restrictions on using GAL for PW 
   as follows: 

   - Section 1 (Introduction) in [RFC5586], the original text: 

          The GAL mechanism is defined to work together with the ACH for 
          LSPs and MPLS Sections. 

      is replaced by: 

          The GAL mechanism is defined to work together with the ACH for 
          LSPs and MPLS Sections, and for PWs. 

   - Section 4.2. (GAL Applicability and Usage) in [RFC5586], the 
      original text: 

          In MPLS-TP, the GAL MUST be used with packets on a G-ACh on 
          LSPs, Concatenated Segments of LSPs, and with Sections, and 
          MUST NOT be used with PWs. It MUST always be at the bottom of 
          the label stack (i.e., S bit set to 1). However, in other MPLS 
          environments, this document places no restrictions on where 
          the GAL may appear within the label stack or its use with PWs. 

      is replaced by: 

          In MPLS-TP, the GAL MUST be used with packets on a G-ACh on 
          LSPs, Concatenated Segments of LSPs, and with Sections, and 
          MAY be used with PWs. It MUST always be at the bottom of the 
          label stack (i.e., S bit set to 1). However, in other MPLS 
          environments, this document places no restrictions on where 
          the GAL may appear within the label stack. 

4. Security Considerations 

   No further security considerations than [RFC5586]. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA actions required.
