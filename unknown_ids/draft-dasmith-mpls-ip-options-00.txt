Abstract

   This document imposes a new requirement on Label Edge Routers (LER)
   specifying that when determining whether to MPLS encapsulate an IP
   packet, the determination is made independent of any IP options that
   may be carried in the IP packet header.  Lack of a formal standard
   may result in a different forwarding behavior for different IP
   packets associated with the same prefix-based Forwarding Equivalence
   Class (FEC).  While an IP packet with either a specific option type

   or no header option may follow the MPLS label switched path (LSP)
   associated with a prefix-based FEC, an IP packet with a different
   option type but associated with the same prefix-based FEC may bypass
   MPLS encapsulation and instead be IP routed downstream.  IP option
   packets that inadvertently bypass MPLS encapsulation present an
   increased security risk against the MPLS infrastructure.

2.0 Motivation

   This document is motivated by the need to formalize MPLS
   encapsulation processing of IP packets with header options transiting
   an MPLS network.  We believe that this document adds details that
   have not been fully addressed in [RFC3031] and [RFC3032], and that
   the methods presented in this document update [RFC3031] as well as
   complement [RFC3443] and [RFC4950].

3.0 Introduction

   The IP packet header provides for various IP options as originally
   specified in [RFC791].  IP header options are used to enable control
   functions within the IP data forwarding plane that are required in
   some specific situations but not necessary for most common IP
   communications. Typical IP header options include provisions for
   timestamps, security, and special routing.  Example IP header options
   & applications include but are not limited to:
     o Strict & Loose Source Route Options: Used to IP route the IP
       packet based on information supplied by the source.
     o Record Route Option: Used to trace the route an IP packet takes.
     o Router Alert Option: Indicates to downstream IP routers to
       examine these IP packets more closely.
   The list of current IP header options can be accessed at [IANA].

   IP packets may or may not use IP header options (they are optional)
   but IP header option handling mechanisms must be implemented by all
   IP protocol stacks (hosts and routers).  Each IP header option has
   distinct header fields and lengths.  IP options extend the IP packet
   header length beyond the minimum of 20 octets.  As a result, IP
   packets received with header options are typically handled as
   exceptions and in a less efficient manner due to their variable
   length and complex processing requirements.  Many router
   implementations, for example, punt such packets from the hardware
   forwarding (fast) path into the software forwarding (slow) path.

   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031] is primarily a
   service provider (SP) technology where IP traffic can be encapsulated
   with a label stack and then label switched across a network via Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) and Routers (LSRs).  MPLS forwarding will
   follow either hop-by-hop routing or source-routing as determined by
   IP routing policies.  MPLS provides SPs with the control plane
   intelligence of IP while at the same time enabling layer 3
   transparency much like ATM switches are transparent at layer 2.  That
   is, when a MPLS label stack is imposed at a ingress Label Edge Router
   (LER), downstream LSRs generally use the MPLS label information for
   their forwarding decision instead of the encapsulated IP header
   information. In this way, except when ICMP processing is required per
   [RFC3032] LSRs can avoid processing the IP network layer headers of
   transit traffic.

   Even though MPLS encapsulation seems to offer a viable solution to
   protect downstream LSRs from being adversely impacted by customer
   packets with IP header options, there is currently no formal standard
   for encapsulation of IP packets with header options in MPLS networks.
   When MPLS encapsulated, IP option packets are processed by downstream
   LSRs as native MPLS packets within their forwarding paths.  In this



Smith, et al.                                                     [Page 3]





Internet Draft    draft-dasmith-mpls-ip-options-00.txt         June 2008


   way, the IP header options are effectively ignored by downstream LSRs
   when encapsulated with a MPLS label stack.  However, for many LER
   implementations not all IP packets with header options are MPLS
   encapsulated by the ingress LER.

   Lack of a formal standard has resulted in inconsistent forwarding
   behaviors by ingress LERs.  Namely, IP packets with different types
   of IP header options are handled differently by an ingress LER
   despite being associated with the same prefix-based FEC as defined in
   Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3031].  For instance, some IP header options may
   inadvertently bypass MPLS encapsulation and the associated LSPs, and
   are instead IP routed downstream on a per-hop basis by downstream
   LSRs within the MPLS core.  The different forwarding behaviors not
   only vary across IP option types but also across ingress LER
   implementations given no formal standard for IP header option
   processing in MPLS networks. This document imposes a new requirement
   on ingress LERs in order to reduce the risk of IP options-based
   security attacks against LSRs as well as to minimize the IP routing
   information carried by LSRs.


4.0 Ingress Label Edge Router Requirement

   An ingress LER MUST implement the following policy, and the policy
   MUST be enabled by default:

     o When determining whether to push an MPLS label stack onto an IP
       packet, the determination is made without considering any IP
       options that may be carried in the IP packet header. Further, the
       label values that appear in the label stack are determined
       without considering any such IP options.

   Further, how an ingress LER processes IP header options before MPLS
   encapsulation is out of scope as it is not relevant to MPLS.
   Similarly, an egress LER SHOULD only process IP options in those
   cases where the egress LER forwarding decision is based on the native
   IP packet. When the egress LER forwarding decision is based on a
   popped label, the MPLS encapsulated IP header information including
   IP options should be ignored with the exception of the IP TTL per
   [RFC3443] and the Tunneled Diff-Serv information per [RFC3270].

   Implementation of the above policy prevents IP packets from
   inadvertently bypassing MPLS encapsulation due to header options. The
   policy also prevents specific option types such as Router Alert
   (value 148), for example, from forcing MPLS imposition of the MPLS
   Router Alert Label (value 1) at ingress LERs. Without this policy,
   the MPLS infrastructure is exposed to security attacks using
   legitimate IP packets crafted with header options.

Internet Draft    draft-dasmith-mpls-ip-options-00.txt         June 2008


5.0 Security Considerations

   There are two potential categories of attacks using crafted IP option
   packets that threaten the MPLS infrastructure. Both are described
   below.


5.1. IP Option Packets that Bypass MPLS Encapsulation

   Given that a router's exception handling process (i.e., CPU,
   processor line-card bandwidth, etc.) used for IP header option
   processing is often shared with IP control and management protocol
   router resources, a flood of IP packets with header options may
   adversely affect a router's control and management protocols,
   thereby, triggering a denial-of- service (DoS) condition.  Note, IP
   packets with header options may be valid transit IP packets with
   legitimate sources and destinations. Hence, a DoS-like condition may
   be triggered on downstream transit IP routers that lack protection
   mechanisms even in the case of legitimate IP option packets.

   IP option packets that bypass MPLS encapsulation at a ingress LER may
   be inadvertently IP routed downstream across the MPLS core network
   (not label switched).  This allows an external attacker the
   opportunity to maliciously craft seemingly legitimate IP packets with
   specific IP header options in order to intentionally bypass MPLS
   encapsulation at the MPLS edge (i.e., ingress LER) and trigger a DoS
   condition on downstream LSRs.  Some of the specific types of IP
   option-based security attacks that may be leveraged against MPLS
   networks include:
     o Crafted IP option packets that bypass MPLS encapsulation at a
       ingress LER may allow an attacker to DoS downstream LSRs by
       saturating their software forwarding paths.  By targeting a LSR's
       exception path, control and management protocols may be adversely
       affected and, thereby, a LSR's availability.  This assumes, of
       course, that downstream LSRs lack protection mechanisms.
     o Crafted IP option packets that bypass MPLS encapsulation at a
       ingress LER may allow for IP TTL expiry-based DoS attacks against
       downstream LSRs.  MPLS enables IP core hiding whereby transit IP
       customers see the MPLS network as a single router hop [RFC3443].
       However, MPLS core hiding does not apply to packets that bypass
       MPLS encapsulation and, therefore, IP option packets may be
       crafted to expire on downstream LSRs which may trigger a DoS
       condition.  This assumes, of course, that downstream LSRs lack
       protection mechanisms. Bypassing MPLS core hiding is an
       additional security consideration since it exposes the network
       topology.





Smith, et al.                                                     [Page 5]





Internet Draft    draft-dasmith-mpls-ip-options-00.txt         June 2008


     o Crafted IP option packets that bypass MPLS encapsulation at a
       ingress LER may allow an attacker to bypass LSP Diff-Serv tunnels
       [RFC3270] and any associated MPLS CoS field [MPLSCOS] marking
       policies at ingress LERs and, thereby, adversely affect (i.e.,
       DoS) high-priority traffic classes within the MPLS core. Further,
       this could also lead to theft of high-priority services by
       unauthorized parties.  This assumes, of course, that the
       [RFC3270] Pipe model is deployed within the MPLS core.
     o Crafted IP strict and loose source route option packets that
       bypass MPLS encapsulation at a ingress LER may allow an attacker
       to specify explicit IP forwarding path(s) across an MPLS network
       and, thereby, target specific LSRs with any of the DoS attacks
       outlined above.  This assumes, of course, that the MPLS network
       is enabled to process IP strict and loose source route options.
     o Crafted RSVP packets that bypass MPLS encapsulation at a ingress
       LER may allow an attacker to build RSVP soft-states [RFC2205] on
       downstream LSRs which could lead to theft of service by
       unauthorized parties or to a DoS condition caused by locking up
       LSR resources. This assumes, of course, that the MPLS network is
       enabled to process RSVP packets.

   The security attacks outlined above specifically apply to IP option
   packets that bypass ingress LER label stack imposition. Additionally,
   these attacks apply to IP option packets forwarded using the global
   routing table (i.e., IPv4 address family) of a ingress LER.  IP
   option packets associated with a BGP/MPLS IP VPN service are always
   MPLS encapsulated by the LER per [RFC4364] given that packet
   forwarding uses a Virtual Forwarding/Routing (VRF) instance.
   Therefore, BGP/MPLS IP VPN services are not subject to the threats
   outlined above [RFC4381]. Further, IPv6 [RFC2460] makes use of
   extension headers not header options and is therefore outside the
   scope of this document.  A separate security threat that does apply
   to both BGP/MPLS IP VPNs and an IPv4 address family makes use of the
   Router Alert Label. This is described directly below.


5.2. Router Alert Label Imposition

   [RFC3032] defines a "Router Alert Label" (value of 1) which is
   analogous to the "Router Alert" IP header option.  The MPLS Router
   Alert Label (when exposed and processed only) indicates to downstream
   LSRs to examine these MPLS packets more closely.  MPLS packets with
   the MPLS Router Alert Label are also handled as an exception by LSRs
   and, again, in a less efficient manner.  At the time of this writing,
   the only legitimate use of the Router Alert Label is for LSP
   ping/trace [RFC4379].  Since there is also no formal standard for
   Router Alert Label imposition at ingress LERs:




Smith, et al.                                                     [Page 6]





Internet Draft    draft-dasmith-mpls-ip-options-00.txt         June 2008


     o Crafted IP packets with specific IP header options (e.g., Router
       Alert) may allow an attacker to force MPLS imposition of the
       Router Alert Label at ingress LERs and, thereby, trigger a DoS
       condition on downstream LSRs.  This assumes, of course, that
       downstream LSRs lack protection mechanisms.


6.0 IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


7.0 Conclusion

   This document imposes a new requirement on ingress LERs that helps to
   mitigate the risk of crafted security attacks using IP option packets
   against MPLS infrastructures.  The security threats were described
   and exist as a result of no formal ingress LER specification for MPLS
   encapsulation of IP packets with header options. Adoption of this
   requirement will also eliminate the variability among ingress LER
   implementations.
