1.  Introduction

   This document contains test renditions for the changes specified in
   [RFC5741], plus the "Trust Legal Provisions" (TLP, [TLP4.0], as
   generated by an experimental version of rfc2629.xslt (see
   <http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/rfc2629xslt.html>).
   Its purpose is to illustrate the resulting text for all the
   variations of the various input parameters, and to track the changes
   applied to the proposal during the RFC-Editor's publication process.


2.  Implementation Status for Xml2Rfc

   Please join the xml2rfc mailing list
   (<http://lists.xml.resource.org/mailman/listinfo/xml2rfc>) for
   discussion of changes to the RFC 2629 vocabulary ([RFC2629]).

2.1.  rfc2629.xslt (XML -> XSLT -> (X)HTML|XSL-FO)

   The examples below were generated with an experimental version of
   rfc2629.xslt (see
   <http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/rfc2629xslt.html>).

2.2.  xml2rfc.tcl (XML -> TCL -> TXT|HTML)

   At the time of this writing, there was no work scheduled for updating
   xml2rfc, thus no direct conversion of XML source to TXT files is
   available (see <http://xml.resource.org>).
