Internet-Draft           EAP Session Policy               October 2009


1. Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC 3261] is an application
   layer control (signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and
   terminating sessions with one or more participants. These sessions
   can include VoIP (Voice over IP) telephone calls, and multimedia
   conferences. Service providers may have policies that apply to the
   media types negotiated for SIP sessions and hence it is necessary for
   proxy servers to be able to influence the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) negotiation during SIP session establishment and
   modification.

   This document specifies an alternative policy channel mechanism,
   utilizing EAP to transport the policy channel protocol between the
   mobile device and an INC, to obtain session policies, primarily for
   bandwidth constrained networks.

1.1. Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

2. Terminology

   A mixture of both EAP and SIP terminology is used within this
   document, with the following equivalence:

   EAP client = SIP user agent (UA) = mobile device
   EAP peer = home network server
   Initial Network Component (INC) = Authenticator = PDG (Packet Data
   Gateway)

   In addition, this document uses the following terms:

   ERP - EAP re-authentication Protocol
   IMS - IP Multimedia Subsystem
   PCC - Policy Control and Charging
   PCRF - Policy Control and Charging Rules Function
   SDP - Session Description Protocol
   SIP - Session Initiation Protocol
   SPE - Session Policy Exchange

3. Session Policy

3.1. SIP background

   Using SIP for the policy channel provides a good general purpose
   solution for the internet being independent of the underlying policy
   and network architecture and ensures that all SIP user agents (mobile
   devices) can interact with any PCCs.  However, for limited bandwidth
   access networks, such as cellular systems, the SIP Events framework
   [RFC 3265] is an inefficient realization of the policy channel. With
   limited bandwidth access networks the large SIP messages take a
   significant amount of time to be transported between the mobile
   device and the network.

3.2. 3GPP IMS

   3GPP has defined IMS as a next generation network architecture for
   establishing IP multimedia sessions including services such as
   multimedia telephony. IMS was originally developed for 3GPP GSM and
   UMTS cellular networks but has also been adopted by 3GPP2, TISPAN,
   and Cablelabs as the next generation network for CDMA cellular
   networks, fixed line DSL networks and DOCSIS cable networks. In
   addition other wireless technologies such as IEEE 802.11 WLAN and
   WIMAX can be used to access IMS networks and work is currently in
   progress to use IMS for SIP based enterprise access and interconnect.

   3GPP has defined an architecture for Policy Control and Charging
   (PCC) that performs the necessary Authorization and Accounting
   functions for mobile device access to IMS bearer resources.  The PCC
   architecture includes a Policy Server, the PCRF (Policy Control and
   Charging Rules function) which, based on inputs from various sources,
   determines which mobile devices are allowed bearer access based on
   the attributes and characteristics of the session (such as the number
   of streams, the media types, and the codecs).

   As the separate entities within the PCC communicate using the
   Diameter or RADIUS protocol it is quite appropriate that a mature
   authentication protocol be considered for session policy
   establishment, operating within a Diameter and RADIUS AAA server
   regime.

   EAP is a good candidate because it allows a mobile device to
   communicate with AAA infrastructure

   1. IMS PCCs use Diameter or RADIUS and EAP already operates over
   these networks without requiring an upgrade.

   2. EAP is already implemented or will be implemented in many mobile
   terminals since EAP is specified for use by mobile terminals for
   authentication when using WLAN access.

   3. EAP is access independent and compatible for use with all the
   access networks and policy control architectures of the current IMS
   stakeholders.

   4. EAP is a lightweight protocol that is efficient for transport over
   bandwidth constrained access networks with minimal round trip delay
   and power consumption.

3.3. Management of Asynchronous Session Events

   Although EAP does show some advantages, it is primarily designed to
   be an authentication mechanism, which establishes a security
   association (SA), prior to any application session being considered.
   In this respect EAP exchanges are expected to occur once a wireless
   connection has been made, as opposed to every time a SIP session
   wishes to commence.

   However, using EAP Re-authentication Protocol [RFC5296], it is
   possible to re-establish an EAP method independent tunnel, with a
   similar security association to that of the initial EAP exchange. It
   supports EAP re-authentication for a mobile device (i.e. the EAP
   peer) that has valid, unexpired key material from a previously
   performed EAP authentication

   In this manner, ERP can be utilized every time the mobile device
   wishes to initialize a SIP session.

4. Session policy channel

   An EAP based session policy channel is an alternative mechanism for
   implementing the policy channel defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-session-
   policy-framework] that builds upon the capabilities that exist in IMS
   networks while being more suited for use by SIP mobile devices in
   these bandwidth constrained networks.

         *** Media


                  Figure 1 - Session Policy Architecture

   Figure 1 illustrates a system in which session offer/answer (policy)
   exchanges (SPE) can be sent by encapsulating the messages within EAP
   and a suitable AAA protocol (see below). A mobile device connects to
   an initial network component - INC (e.g. a gateway, an access point,
   a network access server, or another component with substantially
   equivalent capabilities). In the process of authenticating the mobile
   device, a lower layer communication path (session policy channel) is
   created between the mobile device and the PCC, via the INC.

   The mobile device sends the SPE containing the session policy offer
   information and possibly the intended SDP answer information to the
   INC using a session policy generic message (section 6.16.1. )
   encapsulated within an EAP TLV message.

   Although only one PCC is shown in Figure 1, multiple PCCs could be
   present.  The INC forwards the SPEs to the PCC encapsulated within a
   Diameter AVP (or some other lower layer protocol with similar
   capabilities.)

   In response the SPEs deliver the resulting session policy documents
   from the PCC back to the mobile device.

Internet-Draft           EAP Session Policy               October 2009


4.1. Session Policy Documents

   Session policy documents are typically the info offer, info answer ,
   policy offer and policy answer, which define policy as stated in [I-
   D.ietf-sip-session-policy-framework] and [I-D.ietf-sipping-media-
   policy-dataset].

   The mobile device gains access to the PCC to obtain the session
   policy documents based on a URI (Uniform Resource Indicator) provided
   in the SPE header.

4.1.1. Network Triggered Policy Change

   For session-dependent policies, if the session policies change during
   a session (because of a change in the available radio resources, for
   example due to congestion or change of access network type), the PCC
   sends a modified session policy document (Figure 4) to the mobile
   device to inform it that the policies have changed so that the mobile
   device can then re-start a new SPE, which re-negotiates the session
   policy.

5. Architecture Considerations

   The SPEs are access network agnostic.  The mobile device connects to
   the INC via one or more of several different wireless or wired
   communication technologies.  Since these architectures typically rely
   on Diameter-based or RADIUS-based PCCs, the mobile device can submit
   SPEs to the INC, regardless of which access networks the mobile
   device uses to finally connect to the network.

5.1. Session Policy Exchange (SPE)

   The mobile device sends a SPE to the INC using a tunneled EAP
   protocol (e.g. using EAP-FAST or EAP-TTLS), so that the exchange is
   secure within an authenticated outer tunnel.

   From this INC, together with the appropriate AAA servers (such as
   PCCs using RADIUS and Diameter), the SPEs can traverse many other
   network components and cross domains.  This potentially enables a PCC
   at the edge of the network (subject to service agreements) to
   communicate with other PCCs in other domains in order to supply a
   composite policy document reflecting the policies from multiple
   domains that the SIP signaling request traverses. Thus the mobile
   device can potentially obtain a single policy document that reflects
   the session policies of all the impacted domains in a SPE instead of
   having to contact multiple PCCs.

                    Figure 2 - EAP Tunnel Initialization

   Message Details:

   (1) EAP Method Exchange (tunnel initialization)

   An EAP exchange is performed between the mobile device and the local
   INC (Packet Data Gateway) with the authentication messages being
   forwarded to the home network AAA server. A suitable EAP method is
   used to establish a tunnel (e.g. EAP-FAST), from which the relevant
   ERP keys are derived for subsequent use [RFC5296].

   (2) [SIP registration with PCCh]

   Although not a part of the layer 2 exchange, it is worth showing that
   SIP registration between the mobile device and the PCCh (home PCC)
   occurs at this point. Subsequent SIP level flows are not shown.

5.1.2. Session Establishment (Mobile Device Triggered)

   The following message flow illustrates how a mobile device initiates
   a session policy using a re-established EAP tunnel. This is a result
   of a mobile device triggered event.

   The home AAA server, then requests policy information from all
   visited networks PCCs, through which the SIP session will traverse,
   utilizing a AAA Policy Request message.

   (7) AAA (Policy Response)

   Each visited PCC will then return its network policy back to the home
   network, where the session policy document is compiled.

   (8) EAP tunnel(Policy Response)

   The session policy document is returned to the INC and is then
   encapsulated within the EAP TLV, before being returned to the mobile
   device.


5.1.3.  Session Establishment (Network Triggered)

   The following message flow illustrates how a network initiates a
   session policy re-establishment. This is a result of a network
   triggered event.

Internet-Draft           EAP Session Policy               October 2009



   A visited PCC changes the session policy (most likely whilst the
   mobile device session is on-going) and indicates to the home nework
   server that a policy change has occurred.

   (10) AAA (Policy Change Event)

   The home network server, sends an Event message to the INC (most
   likely within Diameter)

   (11) EAP Initiate/Re-auth-Start

   The INC then requests the mobile device to execute the ERP.

   The rest of the message flow continues, as described above in section
   5.1.2.

6. Encapsulation of SPEs

   The structure of the SPE is defined as XML, based on the session
   policy XML Schema in {ref}.

   In summary the SPE comprises identification, routing and session
   policy documents, which allows the policy information to be generated
   (typically within the session policy documents themselves), as the
   SPEs traverse the network.

   For over the air between the mobile device and the INC, the SPE is
   encapsulated within an EAP TLV messages and then within a
   RADIUS/Diameter AVP message for the onward network traversal.

6.1. Encapsulation within an TLV

   The type-length-value (TLV) structure, may be used to transport the
   SPE from the mobile device to an INC. The use of a tunneled EAP
   method will provide the required level of security protection.

   The EAP TLV is defined as follows:

   0                   1                   2                   3

6.2. Encapsulation within a Diameter AVP

   The attribute-value-pair (AVP) structure, may be used to transport
   the 2 new required AAA messages as defined in section 5.1.2 from the
   INC (e.g. Packet Data Gateway) to the home network server and vice-
   versa.

   Session Policy Change Event
      This is a message which indicates to the INC, that the session
   policy within the network has changed. It triggers the INC to send an
   EAP-Initiate to the mobile device, request that a further SPE be re-
   started.

   (Note: Work in DIME [I-D.ietf-dime-erp] may already support this
   message type.)


7. AAA URIs

   For 3GPP PCC, or similar AAA infrastructure, AAA URIs are provided in
   the Policy-Contact header.  As per RFC 3588 the following are
   examples of valid Diameter or RADIUS host identities:

   aaa://host.example.com
   aaa://host.example.com:6666

   and additionally a secure version can also be used:

   aaas://host.example.com

   These are also valid identities for the 3GPP PCC architecture (based
   on Diameter) as it supports inter-domain communication between PCCs.

8. Use with SIP

   The EAP mechanisms described above can be used by the mobile device
   for obtaining both session-independent policies and session-specific
   policies, as defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-session-policy-framework].  The
   above discussion focuses on obtaining session-specific polices, but
   the mechanisms can also be used by the mobile device prior to session
   establishment to obtain session-independent policies.

   In addition to media policies, the mechanisms defined herein can be
   used to inform the mobile device to use a different IP address in the

   SDP Offer or Answer, to navigate firewalls or NATs, or to route media
   via a transcoder or other media relay as defined in [I-D.ietf-sip-
   session-policy-framework].

9. Security Considerations

   Session policies can significantly change the behavior of a user
   agent and can be used by an attacker to compromise a user agent.  For
   example, session policies can be used to prevent a mobile device from
   successfully establishing a session (e.g., by setting the available
   bandwidth to zero).  Such a policy can be submitted to the mobile
   device during a session, which causes the mobile device to terminate
   the session.

   It's assumed that the EAP TLV frame is transmitted within an
   authenticated tunnel using a suitable EAP method (e.g. EAP-FAST or
   EAP-TTLS)

   If the EAP method (such as EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA) used for
   authentication is compliant with the EAP Keying Framework (RFC 5247),
   a MIC can be used to protect the session policy request/response
   against forgery and replay attacks.  Alternatively, the session
   policy request/response could be protected with a shared key.

12. Specific Transport Mechanism

   More specifically, one or more EAP frames might be transported over
   an IP-CAN (IP (Internet Protocol) Connectivity Access Network) via
   IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange version 2) over IP per RFC 5108 between
   the mobile device and the INC.  Alternatively, other transport
   protocols could be used, such as transporting EAP over PPP (Point-to-
   Point Protocol) as per RFC 2284, wired IEEE 802 LANs (IEEE-802.1X),
   IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (IEEE-802.11), UDP (L2TP [RFC2661] and
   IKEv2 [IKEv2]), and TCP (PIC). In any of these transport protocols,
   messages are sent at a lower protocol layer than the SIP messages
   themselves, which are typically sent at the application layer.
