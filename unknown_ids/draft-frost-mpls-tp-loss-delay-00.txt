Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP Loss and Delay Measurement       October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-framework]
   comprises the set of protocol functions that meet the requirements
   [RFC5654] for the application of MPLS to transport networks.

   The document [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-requirements] specifies
   Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) definitions and
   requirements for the measurement of packet loss and one-way and two-
   way delay for MPLS-TP pseudowires (PWs), Label Switched Paths (LSPs),
   and Sections.  For convenience these definitions and requirements are
   summarized in the following subsections.

1.1.  Review of Requirements

1.1.1.  Requirements for Packet Loss Measurement

   The MPLS-TP OAM tool-set MUST provide a function to enable the
   quantification of packet loss ratio over a PW, LSP or Section.

   Packet loss ratio is the ratio of the user packets not delivered to
   the total number of user packets transmitted during a defined time
   interval.  The number of user packets not delivered is the difference
   between the number of user packets transmitted by an End Point and
   the number of user packets received at an End Point.

   This function MAY either be performed pro-actively or on-demand.  It
   SHOULD be performed between End Points of PWs, LSPs and Sections.  It
   SHOULD be possible to rely on user traffic to perform that
   functionality.

   The protocol solution(s) developed to perform this function MUST
   apply to point-to-point bidirectional (associated and co-routed)
   LSPs, point-to-point unidirectional LSPs and point-to-multipoint
   LSPs.

1.1.2.  Requirements for Delay Measurement

   The MPLS-TP OAM tool-set MUST provide a function to enable the
   quantification of the one-way, and if appropriate, the two-way, delay
   of a PW, LSP or Section.

   o  One-way delay is the time elapsed from the start of transmission
      of the first bit of a packet by an End Point until the reception
      of the last bit of that packet by the other End Point.

   o  Two-way delay is the time elapsed from the start of transmission
      of the first bit of a packet by a End Point until the reception of

      the last bit of that packet by the same End Point, when loop-back
      is performed at the other End Point.

   This function SHOULD be performed on-demand and MAY be performed pro-
   actively.  It SHOULD be performed between End Points of PWs, LSPs and
   Sections.

   In addition to co-routed bidirectional LSPs, the protocol solution(s)
   developed to perform this function MUST also apply to point-to-point
   associated bidirectional LSPs, point-to-point unidirectional LSPs and
   point-to-multipoint LSPs but only to enable the quantification of the
   one-way delay.

2.  Overview

   The basic procedures for measuring loss and delay over a
   bidirectional connection are conceptually simple.  The following
   figure shows the reference scenario.

                             T1              T2
                   +-------+/     Query       \+-------+

                   |   A   |===================|   B   |
                   |       |<- - - - - - - - - |       |
                   +-------+\     Response    /+-------+
                             T4              T3

                                 Figure 1

   The figure shows a bidirectional connection between two LSRs, A and
   B, and illustrates the temporal reference points T1-T4 associated
   with a measurement operation that takes place at A. The operation
   consists of A sending a query message to B, and B sending back a

   response.  Each reference point indicates the point in time at which
   either the query or the response message is transmitted or received
   over the connection.

   In this situation, A can arrange to measure the packet loss over the
   connection in the forward and reverse directions by sending Loss
   Measurement (LM) query messages to B each of which contains the count
   of packets transmitted prior to time T1 over the connection to B
   (A_TxP).  When the message reaches B, it appends two values and
   reflects the message back to A: the count of packets received prior
   to time T2 over the connection from A (B_RxP), and the count of
   packets transmitted prior to time T3 over the connection to A
   (B_TxP).  When the response reaches A, it appends a fourth value, the
   count of packets received prior to time T4 over the connection from B
   (A_RxP).

   These four counter values enable A to compute the desired loss
   statistics.  Because the transmit count at A and the receive count at
   B (and vice versa) may not be synchronized at the time of the first
   message, and to limit the effects of counter wrap, the loss is
   computed in the form of a delta between messages.

   To measure at A the delay over the connection to B, a Delay
   Measurement (DM) query message is sent from A to B containing a
   timestamp recording the instant at which it is transmitted, i.e. T1.
   When the message reaches B, a timestamp is added recording the
   instant at which it is received (T2).  The message can now be
   reflected from B to A, with B adding its transmit timestamp (T3) and
   A adding its receive timestamp (T4).  These four timestamps enable A
   to compute the one-way delay in each direction, as well as the two-
   way delay for the connection.  The one-way delay computations require
   that the clocks of A and B be synchronized; mechanisms for clock
   synchronization are outside the scope of this document.

   In the case of a unidirectional connection (i.e. a unidirectional
   point-to-point or point-to-multipoint MPLS-TP LSP) rooted at A, the
   first half of each of the above procedures can be carried out to
   measure the forward one-way loss and delay associated with the LSP.
   At this point the measurement can either take place at the terminal
   node(s) of the connection rather than at A, or an out-of-band
   connection can be used, if available, to communicate the data back to
   A.

   LM and DM messages flow over the Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh)
   [RFC5586] of an MPLS-TP connection (pseudowire, LSP or Section).

   [[N1: The term "connection" is used in this document to mean an
   MPLS-TP PW, LSP, or Section.  Either this or another term will be

   defined in the Framework for this purpose. --DF]]

2.1.  Implementation Considerations

   The challenge in carrying out the above procedures lies with the
   implementation.  For accurate loss measurement to occur, packets must
   not be sent between the time the transmit count for an outbound LM
   message is determined and the time the message is actually
   transmitted.  Similarly, packets must not be received and processed
   between the time an LM message is received and the time the receive
   count for the message is determined.  For accurate delay measurement,
   timestamps must be recorded in DM messages at a point in time as
   close as possible to when the message is actually transmitted or
   received over the connection.

   These accuracy requirements imply that a hardware-based forwarding
   implementation may require hardware support for the processing of LM
   and DM messages.  An important consideration of the LM/DM protocol
   and message format is therefore support for efficient hardware
   processing.

   In situations where such accuracy is not required, or the necessary
   level of support is not available, an implementation MAY still
   generate and respond to LM and DM messages but SHOULD make its
   accuracy limitations clear to the user.  In general the DM procedures
   described in this document remain viable under these conditions, but
   the procedures for LM may be inadequate.  An alternate approach to LM
   in such situations is to assemble an approximate view of connection
   quality through sustained invasive generation of test messages
   alongside client traffic.  Such alternative procedures are outside
   the scope of this document.

2.2.  Packet Loss Measurement

   Suppose a bidirectional connection such as an MPLS-TP pseudowire,
   bidirectional LSP, or Section exists between the LSRs A and B. The
   objective is to measure at A the following two quantities associated
   with the connection:

      A_TxLoss (transmit loss): the number of packets transmitted by A
      over the connection but not received at B;

      A_RxLoss (receive loss): the number of packets transmitted by B
      over the connection but not received at A.

   This is accomplished by initiating a Loss Measurement (LM) operation
   at A, which consists of transmission of a sequence of LM query
   messages (LM[1], LM[2], ...) over the connection at a specified rate,



Frost & Bryant           Expires April 21, 2010                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP Loss and Delay Measurement       October 2009


   such as one every 100 milliseconds.  Each message LM[n] contains the
   following value:

      A_TxP[n]: the total count of packets transmitted by A over the
      connection prior to the time this message is transmitted.

   When such a message is received at B, the following value is recorded
   in the message:

      B_RxP[n]: the total count of packets received by B over the
      connection at the time this message is received (excluding the
      message itself).

   At this point, B inserts an appropriate response code into the
   message and transmits it back to A, recording within it the following
   value:

      B_TxP[n]: the total count of packets transmitted by B over the
      connection prior to the time this response is transmitted.

   When the message response is received back at A, the following value
   is recorded in the message:

      A_RxP[n]: the total count of packets received by A over the
      connection at the time this response is received (excluding the
      message itself).

   The transmit loss A_TxLoss[n-1,n] and receive loss A_RxLoss[n-1,n]
   within the measurement interval marked by the messages LM[n-1] and
   LM[n] are computed by A as follows:

   A_TxLoss[n-1,n] = (A_TxP[n] - A_TxP[n-1]) - (B_RxP[n] - B_RxP[n-1])
   A_RxLoss[n-1,n] = (B_TxP[n] - B_TxP[n-1]) - (A_RxP[n] - A_RxP[n-1])

   where the arithmetic is modulo the counter size.

   The derived values

      A_TxLoss = A_TxLoss[1,2] + A_TxLoss[2,3] + ...

      A_RxLoss = A_RxLoss[1,2] + A_RxLoss[2,3] + ...

   are updated each time a response to an LM message is received and
   processed, and represent the total transmit and receive loss over the
   connection since the LM operation was initiated.

   When computing the values A_TxLoss[n-1,n] and A_RxLoss[n-1,n] the
   possibility of counter wrap must be taken into account.  Consider for

Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP Loss and Delay Measurement       October 2009


   example the values of the A_TxP counter at times n-1 and n.  Clearly
   if A_TxP[n] is allowed to wrap to 0 and then beyond to a value equal
   to or greater than A_TxP[n-1], the computation of an unambiguous
   A_TxLoss[n-1,n] value will be impossible.  Therefore the LM message
   rate MUST be sufficiently high, given the counter size and the speed
   and minimum packet size of the underlying connection, that this
   condition cannot arise.  For example, a 32-bit counter for a 100 Gbps
   link with a minimum packet size of 64 bytes can wrap in 2^32 /
   (10^11/(64*8)) = ~22 seconds, which is therefore an upper bound on
   the LM message interval under such conditions.

2.3.  Delay Measurement

   Suppose a bidirectional connection such as an MPLS-TP pseudowire,
   bidirectional LSP, or Section exists between the LSRs A and B. The
   objective is to measure at A one or more of the following quantities
   associated with the connection:

   o  The one-way delay associated with the forward (A to B) direction
      of the connection;

   o  The one-way delay associated with the reverse (B to A) direction
      of the connection;

   o  The two-way delay (A to B to A) associated with the connection.

   Of course, if the first two quantities are known then the third is
   immediate, being just their sum.  Measurement of the one-way delay
   quantities, however, requires that the clocks of A and B be
   synchronized, whereas the two-way delay can be measured directly even
   when this is not the case (provided A and B have stable clocks).

   The measurement is accomplished by sending a Delay Measurement (DM)
   query message over the connection to B which contains the following
   timestamp:

      T1: the time the DM query message is transmitted from A.

   When the message arrives at B, the following timestamp is recorded in
   the message:

      T2: the time the DM query message is received at B.

   At this point B inserts an appropriate response code into the message
   and transmits it back to A, recording within it the following
   timestamp:

Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP Loss and Delay Measurement       October 2009


      T3: the time the DM response message is transmitted from B.

   When the message arrives back at A, the following timestamp is
   recorded in the message:

      T4: the time the DM response message is received back at A.

   At this point, A can compute the two-way delay associated with the
   connection as

      two-way delay = (T4 - T1) - (T3 - T2).

   If the clocks of A and B are known at A to be synchronized, then all
   three delay values can be computed at A as

      forward one-way delay = T2 - T1

      reverse one-way delay = T4 - T3

      two-way delay = forward delay + reverse delay.

2.3.1.  Timestamp Format

   There are at least two significant timestamp formats in common use:
   the timestamp format of the Internet standard Network Time Protocol
   (NTP), described in [RFC1305] and [RFC2030], and the timestamp format
   used in the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) [IEEE1588].

   [[N2: There are actually two PTP timestamp formats: the 1588v1 format
   consists of a 32-bit seconds field and a 32-bit nanoseconds field; in
   1588v2 the seconds field was extended to 48 bits. --DF]]

   The NTP format has the advantages of wide use and long deployment in
   the Internet, and was specifically designed to make the computation
   of timestamp differences as simple and efficient as possible.  On the
   other hand, there is also now a significant deployment of equipment
   designed to support the PTP format.

   The approach taken in this document is therefore to include in DM
   messages fields which identify the timestamp formats used by the two
   devices involved in a DM operation.  This implies that an LSR
   attempting to carry out a DM operation may be faced with the problem
   of computing with and possibly reconciling different timestamp
   formats.  Support for multiple timestamp formats is OPTIONAL.  An
   implementation SHOULD, however, make clear which timestamp formats it
   supports and the extent of its support for computation with and
   reconciliation of different formats for purposes of delay
   measurement.

Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP Loss and Delay Measurement       October 2009


   In accordance with Internet standards for network time, the NTP
   timestamp format is the default format used in DM messages.  This
   format MUST be supported.

2.4.  Delay Variation Measurement

   Packet Delay Variation [RFC3393] is another performance metric
   important in some applications.  The PDV of a pair of packets within
   a stream of packets is defined for a selected pair of packets in the
   stream going from measurement point MP1 to measurement point MP2.
   The PDV is the difference between the one-way delay of the selected
   packets.

   A PDV measurement can therefore be derived from successive delay
   measurements obtained through the procedures in Section 2.3.  An
   important point regarding PDV measurement, however, is that it can be
   carried out based on one-way delay measurements even when the clocks
   of the two systems involved in those measurements are not
   synchronized.

2.5.  Unidirectional Connections

   In the case that the connection from A to (B1, ..., Bk) is
   unidirectional, i.e. is a unidirectional LSP, LM and DM measurements
   can be carried out at B1, ..., Bk instead of at A.

   For LM this is accomplished by initiating an LM operation at A and
   carrying out the same procedures as for bidirectional connections,
   except that no responses from B1, ..., Bk to A are generated.
   Instead, each terminal node B uses the A_TxP and B_RxP values in the
   LM messages it receives to compute the receive loss associated with
   the connection in essentially the same way as described previously,
   i.e.

   B_RxLoss[n-1,n] = (A_TxP[n] - A_TxP[n-1]) - (B_RxP[n] - B_RxP[n-1])

   For DM, of course, only the forward one-way delay can be measured and
   the clock synchronization requirement applies.

   Alternatively, if an out-of-band connection from a terminal node B

   The possible values for these fields are as follows.

   Version: Currently set to 0.

   Flags: Each bit represents a message control flag.  The flags, listed
   in left-to-right (most- to least-significant-bit) order, are:

      Q/R: Set to 0 for a Query and 1 for a Response.

      Remaining bits: Reserved for future specification and set to 0.

   Control Code: Set as follows according to whether the message is a
   Query or a Response as identified by the Q/R flag.

      For a Query:

         0x0: Query (in-band response requested).  Indicates that this
         query has been sent over a bidirectional connection and the
         response is expected over the same connection.

         0x1: Query (out-of-band response requested).  Indicates that
         the response should be sent via an out-of-band channel.

         0x2: Query (no response requested).  Indicates that no response
         to the query should be sent.

      For a Response:

         0x1: Success.  Indicates that the operation was successful.

         0x8: Notification - Data Format Invalid.  Indicates that the
         query was processed but the format of the data fields in this
         response may be inconsistent.  Consequently these data fields
         MUST NOT be used for measurement.

         0x10: Error - Unspecified Error.  Indicates that the operation
         failed for an unspecified reason.

         0x11: Error - Unsupported Version.  Indicates that the
         operation failed because the protocol version supplied in the
         query message is not supported.

         0x12: Error - Unsupported Control Code.  Indicates that the
         operation failed because the Control Code requested an
         operation that is not available for this connection.

         0x13: Error - Authentication Failure.  Indicates that the
         operation failed because the authentication data supplied in

         the query was missing or incorrect.

         0x14: Error - Invalid Source Node Identifier.  Indicates that
         the operation failed because the Source Node Identifier
         supplied in the query is not expected.

         0x15: Error - Invalid Destination Node Identifier.  Indicates
         that the operation failed because the Destination Node
         Identifier supplied in the query is not the identifier of this
         node.

         0x16: Error - Connection Mismatch.  Indicates that the
         operation failed because the connection identifier supplied in
         the query did not match the connection over which the query was
         received.

         0x17: Error - Query Rate Exceeded.  Indicates that the
         operation failed because the rate of query messages exceeded
         the configured threshold.

         0x18: Error - Administrative Block.  Indicates that the
         operation failed because it has been administratively
         disallowed.

         0x19: Error - Temporary Resource Exhaustion.  Indicates that
         the operation failed because node resources were not available.

   Reserved: Currently set to 0.

   Querier Context: Set arbitrarily in a query and copied in the
   response.

   Counter 1-4: Referring to Section 2.2, when a query is sent from A,
   Counter 1 is set to A_TxP and the other counter fields are set to 0.
   When the query is received at B, Counter 2 is set to B_RxP.  At this
   point, B copies Counter 1 to Counter 3 and Counter 2 to Counter 4,
   and re-initializes Counter 1 and Counter 2 to 0.  When B transmits
   the response, Counter 1 is set to B_TxP.  When the response is
   received at A, Counter 2 is set to A_RxP.  All counter values MUST be
   in network byte order.

   Flags: As specified in Section 3.1.

   Control Code: As specified in Section 3.1.

   Querier Timestamp Format: The format of the timestamp values written
   by the querier, as specified in Section 3.3.

   Responder Timestamp Format: The format of the timestamp values
   written by the responder, as specified in Section 3.3.

   Responder's Preferred Timestamp Format: The timestamp format
   preferred by the responder, as specified in Section 3.3.

   Resv (Reserved): Currently set to 0.

   Querier Context: Set arbitrarily in a query and copied in the
   response.

   Timestamp 1-4: Referring to Section 2.3, when a query is sent from A,
   Timestamp 1 is set to T1 and the other timestamp fields are set to 0.
   When the query is received at B, Timestamp 2 is set to T2.  At this
   point, B copies Timestamp 1 to Timestamp 3 and Timestamp 2 to
   Timestamp 4, and re-initializes Timestamp 1 and Timestamp 2 to 0.
   When B transmits the response, Timestamp 1 is set to T3.  When the
   response is received at A, Timestamp 2 is set to T4.  The actual
   formats of the timestamp fields written by A and B are indicated by
   the Querier Timestamp Format and Responder Timestamp Format fields
   respectively.

   Padding: One or more octets of padding may optionally follow the
   Timestamp 4 field in a query, in order to allow for delay measurement
   based on packets of a particular size.  The values of the pad octets,
   if present, are arbitrary, and if any are present they will be copied
   in the response.

   The next version of this document will describe a mechanism to allow
   the querier to specify whether the responder should include padding
   in the response.

3.3.  Timestamp Field Formats

   The following timestamp format field values are specified in this
   document:

      0x0: Network Time Protocol version 4 timestamp format [RFC2030].
      This format consists of a 32-bit seconds field followed by a 32-
      bit fractional seconds field, so that it can be regarded as a
      fixed-point 64-bit quantity.

      0x2: IEEE 1588-2008 Precision Time Protocol timestamp format
      [IEEE1588].  This format consists of a 48-bit seconds field
      followed by a 32-bit nanoseconds field.

   In accordance with Internet standards for network time, the NTP
   timestamp format is the default format used in Delay Measurement
   messages.  This format MUST be supported.  Support for other
   timestamp formats is OPTIONAL.

   Timestamp formats of n < 128 bits in size SHALL be encoded in the
   128-bit timestamp fields specified in this document using the n high-
   order bits of the field.  The remaining 128 - n low-order bits in the
   field SHOULD be set to 0 and MUST be ignored when reading the field.


4.  Operation

4.1.  Loss Measurement Procedures

4.1.1.  Initiating a Loss Measurement Operation

   An LM operation for a particular MPLS-TP connection consists of
   sending a sequence (LM[1], LM[2], ...) of LM query messages over the
   connection at a specific rate and processing the responses received,
   if any.  As described in Section 2.2, the packet loss associated with
   the connection during the operation is computed as a delta between
   successive messages; these deltas can be accumulated to obtain a
   running total of the packet loss for the connection.  The query
   message transmission rate MUST be sufficiently high, given the 64-bit
   LM message counter size and the speed and minimum packet size of the
   underlying connection, that the ambiguity condition noted in
   Section 2.2 cannot arise.

4.1.2.  Transmitting a Loss Measurement Query

   When transmitting an LM Query over an MPLS-TP connection, the Version
   and Reserved fields MUST be set to 0.  The Q/R flag MUST be set to 0
   and the remaining flag bits MUST be set to 0.

   The Control Code field MUST be set to one of the values for Query
   messages listed in Section 3.1; if the connection is unidirectional,
   this field MUST NOT be set to 0x0 (Query: in-band response
   requested).

   The Querier Context field can be set arbitrarily.

   The Counter 1 field SHOULD be set to the total count of packets
   transmitted over the connection prior to this LM Query.  The

Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP Loss and Delay Measurement       October 2009


   remaining Counter fields MUST be set to 0.

4.1.3.  Receiving a Loss Measurement Query

   Upon receipt of an LM Query message, the Counter 2 field SHOULD be
   set to the total count of packets received over the connection prior
   to this LM Query.

   At this point the LM Query message must be inspected.  If the Control
   Code field is set to 0x2 (no response requested), an LM Response
   message MUST NOT be transmitted.  If the Control Code field is set to
   0x0 (in-band response requested) or 0x1 (out-of-band response
   requested), then an in-band or out-of-band response, respectively,
   SHOULD be transmitted unless this has been prevented by an
   administrative, security or congestion control mechanism.

4.1.4.  Transmitting a Loss Measurement Response

   When constructing a Response to an LM Query, the Version and Reserved
   fields MUST be set to 0.  The Q/R flag MUST be set to 1 and the
   remaining flag bits MUST be set to 0.

   The Querier Context field MUST be copied from the LM Query.  The
   Counter 1 and Counter 2 fields from the LM Query MUST be copied to
   the Counter 3 and Counter 4 fields, respectively, of the LM Response.

   The Control Code field MUST be set to one of the values for Response
   messages listed in Section 3.1.  The value 0x10 (Unspecified Error)
   SHOULD NOT be used if one of the other more specific error codes is
   applicable.

   If the response is transmitted in-band, the Counter 1 field SHOULD be
   set to the total count of packets transmitted over the connection
   prior to this LM Response.  If the response is transmitted out-of-
   band, the Counter 1 field MUST be set to 0.  In either case, the
   Counter 2 field MUST be set to 0.

4.1.5.  Receiving a Loss Measurement Response

   Upon in-band receipt of an LM Response message, the Counter 2 field
   SHOULD be set to the total count of packets received over the
   connection prior to this LM Response.

   Upon out-of-band receipt of an LM Response message, the Counter 1 and
   Counter 2 fields MUST NOT be used for purposes of loss measurement.

   If the Control Code in an LM Response is anything other than 0x1
   (Success), the counter values in the response MUST NOT be used for



Frost & Bryant           Expires April 21, 2010                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP Loss and Delay Measurement       October 2009


   purposes of loss measurement.  When the Control Code indicates an
   error condition, the LM operation SHOULD be suspended and an
   appropriate notification to the user generated.  If a temporary error
   condition is indicated, the LM operation MAY be restarted
   automatically.

4.1.6.  Scope of Packet Loss Counters

   By default the packet counts appearing in LM messages on a connection
   MUST include packets transmitted and received over the Generic
   Associated Channel (G-ACh) associated with the connection.  An
   implementation MAY provide the means to change the scope of the LM
   counters to exclude some or all G-ACh messages.  Care must be taken
   in this case to ensure that the scopes of the counters at both ends
   of a connection agree.

4.1.7.  Message Loss and Packet Misorder Conditions

   Because an LM operation consists of a message sequence with state
   maintained from one message to the next, LM is subject to the effects
   of lost messages and misordered packets in a way that DM is not.
   Because this state exists only on the querier, the handling of these
   conditions is, strictly speaking, a local matter.  This section,
   however, presents RECOMMENDED procedures for handling such
   conditions.

   The first kind of anomaly that may occur is that one or more LM
   messages may be lost in transit.  The effect of such loss is that
   when an LM Response is next received at the querier, an unambiguous
   interpretation of the counter values it contains may be impossible,
   for the reasons described at the end of Section 2.2.  Whether this is
   so depends on the number of messages lost and the other variables
   mentioned in that section, such as the LM message rate and the
   connection parameters.

   Another possibility is that LM messages are misordered in transit, so
   that for instance the response to LM[n] is received prior to the
   response to LM[n-1].  A typical implementation will discard the late
   response to LM[n-1], so that the effect is the same as the case of a
   lost message.

   Finally, LM is subject to the possibility that data packets are
   misordered relative to LM messages.  This condition can result, for
   example, in a transmit count of 100 and a corresponding receive count
   of 101.  The effect here is that the A_TxLoss[n-1,n] value (for
   example) for a given measurement interval will appear to be extremely
   (if not impossibly) large.  The other case, where an LM message
   arrives earlier than some of the packets, simply results in those

Internet-Draft     MPLS-TP Loss and Delay Measurement       October 2009


   packets being counted as lost, which is usually what is desired.

   Perhaps the simplest way to detect and handle the case of lost or
   out-of-order LM messages is to incorporate a sequence number in each
   message.  Such a sequence number can be inserted within the bounds of
   the Querier Context field provided for implementation-specific use.
   An implementation adopting this approach can now take the following
   actions:

   [[N4: Text to be added here about handling the above conditions with
   sequence numbers and thresholds. --DF]]

4.2.  Delay Measurement Procedures

4.2.1.  Transmitting a Delay Measurement Query

   When transmitting a DM Query over an MPLS-TP connection, the Version
   and Reserved fields MUST be set to 0.  The Q/R flag MUST be set to 0
   and the remaining flag bits MUST be set to 0.

   The Control Code field MUST be set to one of the values for Query
   messages listed in Section 3.1; if the connection is unidirectional,
   this field MUST NOT be set to 0x0 (Query: in-band response
   requested).

   The Querier Context field can be set arbitrarily.

   The Querier Timestamp Format field MUST be set to the timestamp
   format used by the querier when writing timestamp fields in this
   message; the possible values for this field are listed in
   Section 3.3.  The Responder Timestamp Format and Responder's
   Preferred Timestamp Format fields MUST be set to 0.

   The Timestamp 1 field SHOULD be set to the time at which this DM
   Query is transmitted, in the format indicated by the Querier
   Timestamp Format field.  The other timestamp fields MUST be set to 0.

   One or more pad octets with arbitrary values MAY follow the Timestamp
   4 field.

4.2.2.  Receiving a Delay Measurement Query

   Upon receipt of a DM Query message, the Timestamp 2 field SHOULD be
   set to the time at which this DM Query is received.

   At this point the DM Query message must be inspected.  If the Control
   Code field is set to 0x2 (no response requested), a DM Response
   message MUST NOT be transmitted.  If the Control Code field is set to

   0x0 (in-band response requested) or 0x1 (out-of-band response
   requested), then an in-band or out-of-band response, respectively,
   SHOULD be transmitted unless this has been prevented by an
   administrative, security or congestion control mechanism.

4.2.3.  Transmitting a Delay Measurement Response

   When constructing a Response to a DM Query, the Version and Reserved
   fields MUST be set to 0.  The Q/R flag MUST be set to 1 and the
   remaining flag bits MUST be set to 0.

   The Querier Context and Querier Timestamp Format (QTF) fields MUST be
   copied from the DM Query.  The Timestamp 1 and Timestamp 2 fields
   from the DM Query MUST be copied to the Timestamp 3 and Timestamp 4
   fields, respectively, of the DM Response.

   The Responder Timestamp Format (RTF) field MUST be set to the
   timestamp format used by the responder when writing timestamp fields
   in this message, i.e. Timestamp 4 and (if applicable) Timestamp 1;
   the possible values for this field are listed in Section 3.3.
   Furthermore, the RTF field MUST be set equal either to the QTF or the
   RPTF field.  See Section 4.2.5 for guidelines on selection of the
   value for this field.

   The Responder's Preferred Timestamp Format (RPTF) field MUST be set
   to one of the values listed in Section 3.3 and SHOULD be set to
   indicate the timestamp format with which the responder can provide
   the best accuracy for purposes of delay measurement.

   The Control Code field MUST be set to one of the values for Response
   messages listed in Section 3.1.  The value 0x10 (Unspecified Error)
   SHOULD NOT be used if one of the other more specific error codes is
   applicable.

   If the response is transmitted in-band, the Timestamp 1 field SHOULD
   be set to the time at which this DM Response is transmitted.  If the
   response is transmitted out-of-band, the Timestamp 1 field MUST be
   set to 0.  In either case, the Timestamp 2 field MUST be set to 0.

   If the response is transmitted in-band and the Control Code in the
   message is 0x1 (Success), then the Timestamp 1 and Timestamp 4 fields
   MUST have the same format, which will be the format indicated in the
   Responder Timestamp Format field.

   Padding SHALL be included in the response if, and only if, padding
   was present in the DM Query, in which case the response padding MUST
   be identical to the query padding.

4.2.4.  Receiving a Delay Measurement Response

   Upon in-band receipt of a DM Response message, the Timestamp 2 field
   SHOULD be set to the time at which this DM Response is received.

   Upon out-of-band receipt of a DM Response message, the Timestamp 1
   and Timestamp 2 fields MUST NOT be used for purposes of delay
   measurement.

   If the Control Code in a DM Response is anything other than 0x1
   (Success), the timestamp values in the response MUST NOT be used for
   purposes of delay measurement.  When the Control Code indicates an
   error condition, an appropriate notification to the user SHOULD be
   generated.

4.2.5.  Timestamp Format Negotiation

   In case either the querier or the responder in a DM transaction is
   capable of supporting multiple timestamp formats, it is desirable to
   determine the optimal format for purposes of delay measurement on a
   particular connection.  The procedures for making this determination
   SHALL be as follows.

   Upon sending an initial DM Query over a connection, the querier sets
   the Querier Timestamp Format (QTF) field to its preferred timestamp
   format.

   Upon receiving any DM Query message, the responder determines whether
   it is capable of writing timestamps in the format specified by the
   QTF field.  If so, the Responder Timestamp Format (RTF) field is set
   equal to the QTF field.  If not, the RTF field is set equal to the
   Responder's Preferred Timestamp Format (RPTF) field.

   The process of changing from one timestamp format to another at the
   responder may result in the Timestamp 1 and Timestamp 4 fields in an
   in-band DM Response having different formats.  If this is the case,
   the Control Code in the response MUST NOT be set to 0x1 (Success).
   Unless an error condition has occurred, the Control Code MUST be set
   to 0x2 (Notification - Data Format Invalid).

   Upon receiving a DM Response, the querier knows from the RTF field in
   the message whether the responder is capable of supporting its
   preferred timestamp format: if it is, the RTF will be equal to the
   QTF.  The querier also knows the responder's preferred timestamp
   format from the RPTF field.  The querier can then decide whether to
   retain its current QTF or to change it and repeat the negotiation
   procedures.

5.  A Uni-format Implementation

   Editor's note.  This text on the execution of the protocol on simple
   hardware need further thought and will be updated in the next version
   of this document.

   A simple implementation of this protocol that only understands one
   time format MAY discard all Query messages with a QTF type that it
   does not support.  Similarly a simple implementation may discard all
   Response messages with an RTF type that it does not support.  Sunch
   an implementation would only successfully execute a delay measurement
   if both the query and response systems were configured to use
   identical formats.


6.  Congestion Considerations

   An MPLS-TP network may be traffic-engineered in such a way that the
   bandwidth required both for client traffic and for control,
   management and OAM traffic is always available.  The following
   congestion considerations therefore apply only when this is not the
   case.

   The proactive generation of Loss Measurement and Delay Measurement
   messages for purposes of monitoring the performance of an MPLS-TP
   connection naturally results in a degree of additional load placed on
   both the network and the terminal nodes of the connection.  When
   configuring such monitoring, operators should be mindful of the
   overhead involved and should choose transmit rates that do not stress
   network resources unduly; such choices must be informed by the
   deployment context.  In case of slower links or lower-speed devices,
   for example, lower Loss Measurement message rates can be chosen, up
   to the limits noted at the end of Section 2.2.

   In general, lower measurement message rates place less load on the
   network at the expense of reduced granularity.  For delay measurement
   this reduced granularity translates to a greater possibility that the
   delay associated with a connection temporarily exceeds the expected
   threshold without detection.  For loss measurement, it translates to
   a larger gap in loss information in case of exceptional circumstances
   such as lost LM messages or misordered packets.

   When carrying out a sustained measurement operation such as an LM
   operation or continuous pro-active DM operation, the querier SHOULD
   take note of the number of lost measurement messages (queries for
   which a response is never received) and set a corresponding
   Measurement Message Loss Threshold.  If this threshold is exceeded,
   the measurement operation SHOULD be suspended so as not to exacerbate

   the possible congestion condition.  This suspension SHOULD be
   accompanied by an appropriate notification to the user so that the
   condition can be investigated and corrected.

   From the receiver perspective, the main consideration is the
   possibility of receiving an excessive quantity of measurement
   messages.  An implementation SHOULD employ a mechanism such as rate-
   limiting to guard against the effects of this case.  Authentication
   procedures can also be used to ensure that only queries from
   authorized devices are processed.


7.  Security Considerations

   There are two main types of security considerations associated with
   the exchange of performance monitoring messages such as those
   described in this document: the possibility of a malicious or
   misconfigured device generating an excessive quantity of messages,
   causing service impairment; and the possibility of an unauthorized
   device learning the data contained in or implied by such messages.

   The first consideration is discussed in Section 6.  If reception of
   performance-related data by unauthorized devices is an operational
   concern, message authentication procedures such as those described in
   [xref] should be used to ensure that only queries from authorized
   devices are processed.


8.  IANA Considerations

   A future version of this document will detail IANA considerations
   for:

   o  ACH Channel Types for LM and DM messages

   o  Timestamp format registry

   o  LM and DM Control Codes
