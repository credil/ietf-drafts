1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Overview

   Conveying static location in PIDF-LO [RFC4119] bodies is
   straightforward.  However the difficult part about asynchronous
   notification of location information is that many forms of location
   are measured as a continuous gradient.  Unlike notifications using
   discreet quantities, it is difficult to know when a change in
   location is large enough to warrant a notification.  Moreover,
   different applications require a wide variety of location
   resolutions.  Any optimization made for one application would
   ultimately result in wasteful polling or a sluggish user interface
   for other applications.

   The mechanism described here defines filters in XML [W3C.REC-xml]
   documents which limit location notification to events which are of
   relevance to the subscriber.  These filters persist until they are
   changed with a replacement filter.

   In addition to the relevant filters, this document also defines a new
   XML schema [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1] which can be included in PIDF-LO
   documents to indicate that the resource is inside or outside of a
   container region.


3.  Definition of Location Filter Format

   The granularity of notifications necessary for various geographic
   location applications varies dramatically.  The subscriber should be
   able to get asynchronous notifications with appropriate granularity
   and accuracy, without having to poll or flood the network with
   notifications which are not important to the application.
   Notifications should only happen when the notification would be
   considered an Interesting Event to the subscriber.  This section of
   this document defines an XML filter format to describe interesting
   conditions or events.  The terminal elements in this format are
   defined in terms of existing Geographic Markup Language (GML) [GML]
   data types or civic address elements.

   This document also defines a MIME type for this location filter
   format: application/location-delta-filter+xml.

Internet-Draft           Location Event Filters                July 2008


   This document defines the following as an initial list of Interesting
   Events:
   1.  the resource moves more than a specific distance horizontally or
       vertically since the last notification
   2.  the resource exceeds a specific speed
   3.  the resource enters or exits one or more GML objects (for
       example, a set of 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional regions)
       included or referenced in the filter.
   4.  one or more of the values of the specified address labels has
       changed for the resource (for example, the A1 value of the
       civilAddress has changed from California to Nevada)
   5.  a mininum and maximum rate of reports regardless of movement
   This specification makes use of XML namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names]
   for identifying location filter documents and document fragments.
   The namespace URI for elements defined by this specification is a URN
   [RFC2141], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [RFC2648]
   and extended by [RFC3688].  This URN is:

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:location-filter

   The filter format starts with a top-level XML element called
   "<location-filter>", which contains one or more filter events.  The
   semantics of multiple elements inside a location-filter generally is
   a logical OR.  In other words, if any of the individual filter events
   occurs, the event satisfies the location-filter and triggers a
   notification.  However the "maxRate" parameter is a logical AND, and
   will limit events that otherwise would have been reported.

3.1.  Horizontal and Vertical Movement

   The movedHoriz and movedVert filter events each indicate a minimum
   horizontal motion or vertical distance (respectively) that the
   resource must have moved from the location of the resource when the
   last notification was sent in order to trigger this event.  The
   distance is measured absolutely from the point of last notification
   rather than in terms of cumulative motion (For example, someone
   pacing inside a room will not trigger an event if the trigger
   threshold is slightly larger than the room.)  Each of these events
   can only appear once in a location-filter.  These events have an
   attribute "uom" (for "units of measure"), which indicates the units
   of the element.  The default unit for these events is meters.

   Similarly, the speedExceeds filter event indicates a minimum
   horizontal speed of the resource before the speedExceeds event is
   triggered.  This element can appear only once in a location-filter,
   and has a "uom" attribute which defaults to meters per second if not
   present.

Internet-Draft           Location Event Filters                July 2008


      This filter measures the horizontal component of speed in any
      direction.  It does not measure velocity.  Note also that there is
      no corresponding event triggered when speed drops below a
      threshold.

   Below are some examples.  In the first example if the resource moves
   20m in the x,y direction or 3m in the z direction, send a
   notification:

   <location-filter>
     <movedHoriz uom="urn:ogc:def:uom:EPSG::9001">20</movedHoriz>
     <movedVert uom="urn:ogc:def:uom:EPSG::9001">3</movedVert>
   </location-filter>

   If the resource exceeds 3 meters per second (10.8 km/h), send a
   notification:

   <location-filter>
     <speedExceeds uom="#mps">3</speedExceeds>
   </location-filter>

3.2.  Changes in value

   The valueChanges filter event contains a string which is interpreted
   as an XPath [W3C.xpath] expression evaluated within the context of
   the location-info element of the PIDF-LO document which would be
   generated by the notification.  The XPath expression MUST evaluate to
   only a single Xpath node.  If the value of any of the elements in the
   resulting node changes, then the filter event is triggered.  Note
   that the value of the resulting node changes if any of those nodes or
   subnodes transitions from having a value to having no value or vice
   versa.  A location-filter may contain multiple valueChanges filters.

   For example, given the following logical PIDF-LO document, If the
   state (A1), county (A2), city (A3), or postal code (PC) changes, send
   a notification:

3.3.  Containment Within a Region

   The "enterOrExit" filter event is satisfied when the resource enters
   or exits a named 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional region described by
   one of the shapes defined in section 5 of
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile].  These regions can be defined
   using inline snippets of GML, or externally referenced using a URI

   (Uniform Resource Identifier).
      These regions need a unique name or identifier so location with
      respect to these regions can be described later (for example in a
      notification).  These regions are currently described as GML
      Features so they can be named with a GML Name.  Ideally each
      region could be described instead as a GML geometry with some
      associated name or identifier.

   Any 2-dimensional region MUST be defined using the EPSG 4326
   coordinate reference system.  Any 3-dimensional region MUST be
   defined using the EPSG 4979 coordinate reference system.  A location-
   filter can contain more than one enterOrExit filter event.

      Notifiers MAY support other more complex geometries or additional
      coordinate reference systems.  How the Subscriber negotiates
      support for more complex geometries or reference systems is out of
      the scope of this document.
      Likewise, this document does not describe how a subscriber
      discovers the existence of externally referenced features.  This
      topic is out of scope of this document.

   In most cases Subscribers that use location filters based on
   enterOrExit events are especially interested in the resource's
   relationship to those named features.  Consequently, the notifier
   MUST include either a "containment" element for each feature
   mentioned in the location-filter which has changed its containment
   properties with respect to the resource since the last notification.
   These elements are defined in Section 4.  The notifier MAY include
   any other form of location that is relevant.

   For example, if the resource enters or exits Building 10 (which is
   defined by specific 2-D or 3-D rectangular coordinates), send a
   notification:

   Version in 2-Dimensions:
   <location-filter>

     </enterOrExit>
   </location-filter>

3.4.  Rate Control

   The minRate and maxRate filters control the rate at which
   notifications are sent. minRate can be used to make sure that a
   notification is sent regardless of movement, and maxRate can be used
   to limit the rate at which notifications are sent even when other
   filters would cause many notifications.  Each of these events can
   only appear once in a location-filter.  These events have an
   attribute "uom" (for "units of measure"), which indicates the units
   of the element.  The default unit for these events is minutes.  Rates
   are averaged over one unit of the next larger unit of measure.  For
   example if the uom="minutes", then the rate is measured over one
   hour.

   Examples of minRate and maxRate:

   <location-filter>
     <movedHoriz uom="urn:ogc:def:uom:EPSG::9001">10</movedHoriz>
     <minRate uom="seconds">1</minRate>
     <maxRate uom="seconds">10</maxRate>
   </location-filter>

   This filter specifies that notifications should be sent if the target
   moves by more than 10 meters, but no more than 5 notifications per
   second should be sent.  In addition, if the target is not moving fast
   enough to generate notifications due to movedHoriz, then extra
   notications are sent to achieve approximately 1 notification per
   second averaged over a minute.

3.5.  XML Schema for filter format

   The XML Schema for this format is defined below.

4.  Containment schema

   This section describes a schema for describing the resource's
   location relative to a region or list of regions which might contain
   the resource.  (These regions can be defined dynamically in an
   "enterOrExit" element in a subscription filter, or defined on the
   notifier using some out-of-band mechanism.)  The "pidfResource"
   element is placed inside the location-info element in a PIDF-LO
   document.  The pidfResource element can contain zero or more
   "containment" elements.  Each containment element has a GML Feature
   sub-element (of type "FeaturePropertyType") and a mandatory attribute
   which specifies if the PIDF resource is inside or outside of the
   feature, or if the position of the resource with respect to the
   region or region list is undefined.
      In a future version of this specification, the GML Feature can
      become a reference to a more preferable name or identifier type.
      The GML Feature type is only used because it includes a name to
      reference it.

   If the subscriber is not authorized to know the relative position,
   the notifier MUST NOT reveal this private information.  The
   RECOMMENDED way to prevent the subscriber from seeing private
   location data of this type is to return a containment element whose
   position attribute is "undefined".  Note that in some cases, the
   containment information may be more interesting than the actual raw
   location.  It is not necessary to convey a concrete civic or geo
   location in a PIDF-LO if the subscriber is only interested in or
   authorized to see the containment status.

   Below is an example PIDF-LO document which indicates that the
   resource is inside building 10, not outside the parking garage, and
   not permitted to know if the resource is in a conference room.  Note
   that in GML, these features could be referenced by their unique
   identifiers instead.

5.  Security Considerations

   Location information is typically very privacy sensitive.  As such,
   GEOPRIV requires that notifications MUST be encrypted and integrity
   protected.

   Additional privacy and security considerations are discussed in
   detail in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile].
