	The RFC Editor performs a number of functions that may be
	carried out by various persons or entities. The RFC Editor
	model described in this document divides the responsibilities
	for the RFC Series into four functions: The RFC Series Editor,
	the Independent Submission Editor, the RFC Production Center,
	and the RFC Publisher.  The function of the Independent
Submission Editor is defined here.  The IAB oversight by way of
delegation to the RFC Series Oversight Board is described.
This document reflects 1 year of
        experience with RFC Editor Model version 1.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community, is
	concerned with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series,
	orderly RFC Editor succession, maintaining RFC quality, and
	RFC document accessibility. The IAB is also sensitive to the
	concerns of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
	about providing the necessary services in a cost effective and
	efficient manner.
      </t>
      <t>
	The definition of the RFC series is described in RFC 4844
	<xref target="RFC4844"/>. Section 3.1 defines "RFC Editor":
      </t>
      <t>
	<artwork>
| 3.1. RFC Editor
|
|  Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of the RFC
|  Series (the RFC Editor). The task has grown, and the work now
|  requires the organized activity of several experts, so there are RFC
|  Editors, or an RFC Editor organization. In time, there may be
|  multiple organizations working together to undertake the work
|  required by the RFC Series. For simplicity's sake, and without
|  attempting to predict how the role might be subdivided among them,
|  this document refers to this collection of experts and organizations
|  as the "RFC Editor".
|
|  The RFC Editor is an expert technical editor and series editor,
|  acting to support the mission of the RFC Series. As such, the RFC
|  Editor is the implementer handling the editorial management of the
|  RFC Series, in accordance with the defined processes. In addition,
|  the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime mover in
|  discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and archiving
|  RFCs.
	</artwork>
      </t>
      <t>
	RFC 4844 makes no attempt to explore the internal organization
	of the RFC Editor. However, RFC 4844 envisions changes in the
	RFC Editor organizational structure. In discussion with the
	Internet community, the IAB considered changes that increase
	flexibility and operational support options, provides for the
	orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensures the
	continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC quality,
	maintaining timely processing, ensuring document
	accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing cost
	transparency. The model set forth below is the result of those
	discussions and the experience gained since, as described
immediately below, and examines the internal organization of 
	the RFC Editor, while remaining consistent with RFC 4844.
        This version of the document also reflects the discussions, as
described below, that have occurred since the first efforts to clarify
that internal organization.
      </t>
      <t>
	Note that RFC 4844 uses the term "RFC Editor function" or "RFC
	Editor" as the collective set of responsibilities for which
	this memo provides a model for internal organization. This
	memo defines the term "RFC Series Editor" or "Series
	Editor" for one of the organizational components.
      </t>
      <t>
   The RFC Editor model was first approved in October 1, 2008 and has 
   evolved since. During the implementation of version 1 of the model
   <xref target="RFC5620"/> it was quickly realized that
the role of the RSE and the  
   oversight responsibilities needed to be structured differently. In
   order to gain experience with 'running code' a transitional RFC Series
   Editor was hired who analyzed the managerial environment and provided
   recommendations. This version of the model is based on his recommendations
   and the subsequent discussion on the rfc-interest list. 
      </t>
      <t>
   The document, and the resulting structures,
   will be modified as needed through normal procedures.  The RSE, and
the IAB, through the RFC oversight committee (see <xref target="RSOC"/>), will
continue to monitor discussions  
   within the community about potential
   adjustments to the RFC Editor model and recognizes that the process
   described in this document may need to be adjusted to align with any
   changes that result from such discussions, hence the version number
   in the title.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Administrative Implementation">
      <t>
   The model is constructed in such a way that it sets boundary
conditions on whether these functions are to be implemented jointly or
under separate contractual arrangements. The exact implementation is a
responsibility of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC, 
<xref target="RFC4071"/>) in cooperation with the RFC Series Editor.
      </t>
      
      <section title="Expenses for the RFC Editor">
	<t>
	  The expenses discussed in this document are not new
	  expenses.  They have been and remain part of the 
          IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA, 
          <xref target="RFC4071"/>) budget. 
	</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    
    <section title="RFC Editor Model">
      <t>
	The RFC Editor model divides the responsibilities for
	the RFC Series into the following components:

            Structure of RFC Series production and process.
</artwork>
</figure>
      </t>
      <t>

	In this model documents are produced and approved through
	multiple document streams. The four that now exist are
	described in [RFC4844]. Documents from these streams are
	edited and processed by the Production Center and published by
	the Publisher. The RFC Series Editor will exercise
	executive management over the activities of the
	RFC Publisher and the RFC Production Center (which can be seen
	as back office functions) and will be the entity that:
      </t>
      <t>
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>Provides Executive Management for the overall operation
of the RFC Editor, including the Production and Publication components.</t>
	  <t>Represents the RFC Series and the RFC Editor Function
within the IETF and externally.</t>
	  <t>Is responsible for planning and seeing to the execution
of improvements in the RFC Editor Production and Access Processes.</t>
	  <t>Leads the community in the development of improvements to
the RFC Series.</t>
	</list>
      </t>
      <t>These responsibilities are defined below, although the
specific work items under them are a matter for the actual employment
contract and its Statement of Work.</t>
      <t>
	The IAB and IAOC maintain their chartered
	responsibility as defined in <xref target="RFC2850"/> and
        <xref target="RFC4071"/>.  More details on the
        oversight by the IAB via the RFC Series Oversight Committee 
        (RSOC) can be found in <xref target="RSOC"/>.
      </t>
      <t> 
	Therefore, the RSE does not have the direct authority to 
        hire or fire RFC Editor
	contractors or personnel.  Serious issues, such as those that
might be detected during the RSE annual review of the production
facility, would be brought by the RSE to the RSOC, and escalated from
there if appropriate.
      </t>
      
      
      <section anchor="RSE" title="RFC Series Editor">
	<t>
	  The RFC Series Editor is the individual with overall
responsibility 
for the quality, continuity, and evolution of the RFC Series.  While
that individual may, in the future, have assistants; at present there
are no staff other
than those associated with the RFC Series Production and Publication
facility.</t>

	<t>The RSE is appointed by the IAB, but formally hired by the 
        IAOC. The IAB delegates the direct oversight over the RSE to the
        RSOC, which it appoints.</t>
	  
        <section anchor="ExecManage" title="Executive Management of
the Publication and Production function">
        <t> With respect to the Publication and Production functions, the RSE
      provides input to the IASA budget, statements of work, and manages
      vendor selection processes.  The RSE performs annual reviews of
      the Production and Publication function which are then provided to
      the RSOC and the IASA.</t>

      <t>Vendor selection is done in cooperation with the streams and under
      final authority of the IASA.</t>

      <t>Concretely:</t>

      <t>
	<list style="symbols">
         <t>The RSE owns and develops the work definition (the SOW) and
         manages the vendor search processes.  The work definition is
         created within the (budgetary) boundary condition that are
         negotiated with IASA and takes into account the RSE's
         requirements and community input.</t>

         <t>The RSE manages the evaluation process of the bids against the
         SOW and then provides a recommendation to the IASA.</t>

         <t>Final vendor selection is done by the IASA in close
         consultation with the RSE to ensure that contract terms and
         other arrangements are consistent with the SOW, consistent with
         the both RSE's and contractor's requirements to satisfy the
         contract.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t> The IASA has the responsibility to approve the total RSE budget
      (and the authority to deny it). The RSE has the responsibility to
      manage all the series functions within that budget.  It is assumed
      that there is a level of cooperation between RSE and IASA that
      allows decisions by the IASA to be 'pro forma'.  In case of
      disagreement, the IAB will attempt to mediate the issue.  If no
      mutual agreement can be reached, the IAB will make the final
      decision.</t>

      <t>When budgets have been assigned by IASA the RSE is responsible for
      managing the RFC Editor to operate within those budgets.  If
      production needs change,  the RSE is responsible for working
      with the production facility to determine what the correct
      response should be.  If they agree that a budgetary change is
      needed, that needs to be taken to the IAD and the IAOC.    
      </t>

      <t>The RSE primarily supervises the on-going performance of the
      vendors without asserting direct operational responsibility.
However, 
      the RSE has operational responsibilities for issues that raise
      above the responsibilities of the publication or publication
      functions such as cross stream coordination of priorities and
      other issues.  When the RSE needs to take extra-budgetary or
      out-of contract measures those actions will be coordinated with
      IASA.</t>

      <t>The RSE is also responsible for creating documentation and 
      structures that will allow for the RFC
      Series' continuity when circumstances engender the need for the
      execution of the publication and/or production functions by other
      vendors.</t>

      <t>For this type of responsibility the RSE is expected to cooperate
   closely with the IASA and the various streams.</t>

      <t> To prevent actual or apparent problems with conflicts of interest or
   judgment, the RSE is barred from having any ownership, advisory, or
   other relationship to the vendors executing the Publication or
   Production functions except as specified elsewhere in this document.
   If necessary, an exception can be made after public disclosure of
   those relationships and with the explicit permission of the IAB and
   IASA.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="SeriesRep" title="Representation of the RFC
Series">
        <t>The RSE is the primary representative of the RFC Series.
This representation is important both internally, relative to the
IETF, and externally.</t>
        <section anchor="IETFRep" title="Representation to the IETF">
        <t>The RSE is the primary point of contact the IETF on matters
other than the practicalities of producing individual RFCs (which are
worked with the RFC Production staff.)</t>

        <t>This includes providing suitable reports to the community
at large; providing email contact for policy questions and inputs; and
enabling and participating in suitable on-line forums for discussion
of issues related to the RFC Series.</t>

        <t>Due to the history and nature of the interaction between
the RSE and the IETF, certain principles must be understood and
adhered to by the RSE in his or her interactions with the community.  These
apply to the representation function, as well as to the leadership the
RSE provides in Production and Series Development.</t>

        <section title="Volunteerism">
           <t>The vast majority of Internet technical community work
is led, initiated, and done by community volunteers, including
oversight, policy-making, and direct production of, for example, many
software tools.  The Series Editor role relies on volunteer
participation and needs to support the vitality and effectiveness of
volunteer participation.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Policy Authority">
          <t>All decisions are to be made in the overall interest of
the community. The community is the arbiter of policy.
The RSE must consult with the community on policy issues.  
The RSE works with the community to achieve policy that meets
the overall quality, continuity, and evolution goals the RSE is
charged with meeting.  As
described below in <xref target="RSOC"/> the RSE reports the results
of such interactions to the RSOC, including the specific
recommendations on policy.  This enables the RSOC to provide the
oversight the IAB is required to apply, as well as to confirm that the
IETF community has been properly consulted and considered in making policy.

        </section>

        <section anchor="ExtRep" title="External Representation">
        <t>From time to time, individuals or organizations external to
the IETF need a contact person to talk to about the RFC Series.  The
RSE is that individual.</t>

        <t>Over time, the RSE should determine what if any means
should be employed to increase end-user awareness of the series, and
to reinforce the stature of the Series, and will be the contact point
for outside parties seeking information on the Series or the
Editor.</t>

        <section anchor="ProdDev" title="Development of RFC Production
and RFC Access">
          <t>Closely related to providing executive management to the
RFC Production and Publication functions is the need to develop and
improve those functions.  The RSE is responsible for ensuring that
such ongoing development takes place.</t>
          <t>This effort must include the dimensions of document
quality, timeliness of production, and accessibility of results.  It
must also specifically take into account issues raised by the IETF
community.</t>

        <section anchor="SeriesDev" title="Development of the RFC
Series"> 
           <t>In order to develop the RFC Publication series the RSE
is expected to 
   develop a relationships with the Internet technical community.  With
   that community, the Editor is expected to engage in a process of
   articulating and refining a vision for the Series and its continuous
   evolution.</t>

  <t>Concretely:
   <list style="hanging">
      <t>The RSE is responsible for the coordination of discussion on
      Series evolution among the Series' Stream participants and the
      broader Internet technical community.</t>

      <t>In time the RSE is expected to develop and refine a vision
 for the RFC Series, including examining:
         <list style="hanging">
         <t>the technical specification series, as it continues to
         evolve.  The RSE is expected to take a broad view and be
         be looking for the best ways to evolve the series for the
         benefit of the entire Internet Community.  As such, the
         RSE may even consider evolution 
         beyond the historical 'by engineers for engineers' emphasis;
         and</t>

         <t>and its publication-technical environment: looking
         at whether it should be slowly changing in terms
         of publication and archiving techniques; particularly
         to better serve the communities that
         produce and depend on the RFC Series.  For example, all of 
         those communities
         have been slowly changing to include significant multi-lingual
         and non-native-English populations.  Another example is that
         some of these constituencies also have a
         shifted to include significant groups of members whose primary
         focus is on the constraints and consequences of network
         engineering, rather than a primary interest in the engineering
         issues themselves.</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>The RSE will develop consensus versions of vision and policy
      documents which will be approved by the RFC Series Oversight
      Committee (<xref target="RSOC"/>).</t>
   </list>
   </t>

   <t>For this type of responsibility the RSE cooperates closely with the

	  As described below (<xref target="RSOC"/>) the IAB appoints
the RSOC and delegates authority to it.  One of the first
responsibilities of the RSOC will be to define in detail the
solicitation and selection process for the next RSE.  The RSOC is
expected to document to the community the process it selects.  Upon
completion of selection, the RSOC should determine the best way to
preserve this information for future use.

          The Independent Submission Editor (ISE) is the head of the
          Independent Submission Stream of RFCs, as defined by 
          <xref target="RFC4844"/>.  While formally part of the
          RFC Editor function, the Independent Stream and the
          Independent Submission Editor are not under the
          authority or direction of the RSE.  As noted below,
          the ISE is appointed by and is responsible directly to the
          IAB.
        </t>
        <t> 
	  The Independent Submission Editor is an individual who may
	  have assistants and who is responsible for:
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list style="numbers">
	    <t>Maintaining technical quality of the Independent Submission stream.</t>
	    <t>Reviewing, approving, and processing Independent Submissions.</t>
	    <t>Forwarding draft RFCs in the Independent Submission Stream to the RFC Production Center.</t>
	    <t>Reviewing and approving Independent Submissions RFC errata.</t>
	    <t>Coordinating work and conforming to general RFC Series
	    policies as specified by the IAB and RSE.</t>
	    <t> Providing statistics and documentation as requested by the RSE and/or IAOC.</t>
	  </list>
	</t>

	<t>
	  The Independent Submission Editor is a senior position for
	  which the following qualifications are desired:
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list style="numbers">
	    <t>Technical competence, i.e., broad technical experience
	    and perspective across the whole range of Internet
	    technologies and applications, and specifically, the
	    ability to work effectively with portions of that spectrum
	    in which no personal expertise exists.</t>
	    <t>Thorough familiarity with the RFC series.</t>
	    <t>An ability to define and constitute advisory and
	    document review arrangements.  If those arrangements
	    include an Editorial Board similar to the current one or
	    some equivalent arrangement, assess the technical
	    competence of potential Editorial Board members. </t>
	    <t>Good standing in the technical community, in and beyond
	    the IETF.</t>
	    <t> Demonstrated editorial skills, good command of the
	    English language, and demonstrated history of being able
	    to work effectively with technical documents and materials
	    created by others.</t>
	    <t>The ability to work effectively in a multi-actor
	    environment with divided authority and responsibility
	    similar to that described in this document.
	    </t>
	  </list>

	  The Independent Submission Editor may seek support from an
	  advisory board (see <xref target="editorial_board"/>) and
	  may form a team to perform the activities needed to fulfill
	  their responsibilities.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The individual with the listed qualifications will be
	  selected by the IAB after input is collected from the
	  community. An approach similar to the one used by the IAB
	  to select an IAOC member every other year as described in
	  <xref target="RFC4333"/> should be used. While the ISE
	  itself is considered a volunteer function, the IAB considers
	  maintaining the Independent Submission stream within the RFC Series
	  part of the IAB's supported activities, and will include the
	  expenses made for the support of the ISE in its
	  IASA-supported budget.

      The RFC Production Center contractor is to be selected by the

      who, among other things, is able to provide a professional,
      quality, timely, and cost effective service against the
      established style and production guidelines. Contract terms,
      including length of contract, extensions and renewals, shall be

    <t>The IAB is responsible for oversight over the RFC Series.</t>

   <t>In order to provide continuity over periods longer than the nomcom
   appointment cycle and assure that oversight is informed through
   subject matter experts the IAB will establish a group that implements
   oversight for the IAB, the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC).</t>

   <t>The RSOC will act with authority delegated from the IAB: In general
   it will be the RSOC that will approve consensus policy and vision
   documents as developed by the RSE in collaboration with the
   community.</t>

   <t>In those general cases the IAB is ultimately responsible for
   oversight and acts as a body for appeal and resolution.</t>

   <t>For all aspects that affect the RSE itself (e.g. hiring and firing)
   the RSOC prepares recommendations for the IAB but final decision is
   the responsibility of the IAB.  For instance the RSOC would:

   <list style="symbols">
     <t>perform annual reviews of the RSE and reports to the IAB.</t>

     <t> manage RSE candidate selection and advises the IAB on candidate
      appointment (in other words select the RSE, subject to IAB
      approval)</t>
   </list>
   </t>

   <t>It is expected that such oversight by the IAB is a matter of due
   diligence and that the reports and recommendations from the RSOC are
   approached as if they are binding.</t>

   <t>RSOC members are expected to recognize potential conflicts of
interest and behave accordingly.</t>

   <t>There is one aspect in which the RSOC will work with the IASA: the
   remuneration of the RSE itself.  The RSOC will propose a budget for
   approval to the IASA.</t>

   <t>The RSOC will be responsible to ensure that the RFC Series is run in
   a transparent and accountable manner.</t>

   <t>The RSOC shall develop and publish its own rules of order.</t>

   <section anchor="RSOCCompose" title="RSOC composition">

   <t>
   The RSOC will operate under the authority of the IAB, with the IAB 
   retaining final responsibility.  The IAB will delegate authority and
   responsibility to the RSOC as appropriate and as RSOC and RSE
   relationships evolve.  The RSOC will include people who are not
   current IAB members.  Currently, this is aligned with the IAB
   Program structure.   The IAB will designate the
   membership of the RSOC with the goals of preserving effective
   stability, keeping it small enough to be effective, but large enough
   to provide general Internet Community expertise, specific IETF
   expertise, Publication expertise, and stream expertise.  Members
   serve at the pleasure of the IAB and are expected to bring a balance
   between short and long term perspective.  Specific input about, and
   recommendations of, members will be sought from the streams, the
   IASA, and the RSE.</t>

   <t>The RSE and a person designated to represent the IASA will serve as
   ex-officio members of the RSOC but either or both can be excluded
   from its discussions if necessary.</t>

      <section anchor="dispute" title="Disagreements Among RFC Editor Entities">

	<t>
	  If during the execution of their activities, a disagreement
	  arises over an implementation decision made by one of the
	  entities in the model, any relevant party should first
	  request a review and reconsideration of the decision.  If
	  that party still disagrees after the reconsideration, that
	  party may ask the RSE to decide or, especially if the RSE is
	  involved, that party may ask the IAB Chair (for a technical
	  or procedural matter) or IAD (for an administrative or
	  contractual one) to mediate or appoint a mediator to aid in
	  the discussions, although neither is obligated to do so.
	  All parties should work informally and in good faith to
	  reach a mutually agreeable conclusion.
	</t>

	<t>
	  If such a conclusion is not possible through those informal
	  processes, then the matter must be registered with the RFC
	  Series Oversight Committee. The RSOC may choose to offer advice
	  to the RSE or more general advice to the parties involved
	  and may ask the RSE to defer a decision until it formulates
	  its advice. However, if a timely decision cannot be reached
	  through discussion, mediation, and mutual agreement, the
	  Series Editor is expected to make whatever decisions are
	  needed to ensure the smooth functioning of the RFC Editor
	  function; those decisions are final.
	</t>

	<t>
	  RSE decisions of this type are limited to the functioning of
	  the process and evaluation of whether current policies are
	  appropriately implemented in the decision or need
	  adjustment. In particular, it should be noted that final
	  decisions about the technical content of individual
	  documents are the exclusive responsibility of the stream
	  approvers for those documents, as shown in the illustration
	  in <xref target="model-figure"/>.
	</t>

	<t>
	  If informal agreements cannot be reached, then formal RSOC
	  review and decision making may be required.  If so, the
	  the RSE must identify the issues involved to the community,
          so that the community is aware of the situation.  The RSE
          will the report the issue to the RSOC for formal resolution
          by the RSOC with confirmation by the IAB in its oversight
          capacity.
	</t>
	<t>
	  IAB and community discussion of any patterns of disputes are
	  expected to inform future changes to Series policies
	  including possible updates to this document.
	</t>
	

        <section title="Issues with Contractual Impact"> 
	<t>
	  If a disagreement or decision has immediate or future
	  contractual consequences, the Series Editor must identify
	  the issue to the IAOC and, if the RSOC has provided advice,
	  forward that advice as well. After the IAOC has notified the
	  IAB, the IAD as guided by the IAOC, with advice provided by
	  the Series Editor, has the responsibility to resolve these
	  contractual issues.

    <section title="Independent Submission Stream Editorial Board" anchor="editorial_board">
    <t>
   The Independent Submission Editor is supported by an Editorial
   Board for the review of Independent Submission stream documents.
   This board is known as the Independent Submission Stream Editorial
   Board.  This volunteer Editorial Board exists at the pleasure of
   the ISE, and the members 
      serve at the pleasure of the ISE. The existence of this board is
      simply noted within this model, and additional discussion of

  <section title="IANA considerations">
    <t>
      This document defines several functions within the overall
      RFC  Editor structure, and it places the responsibility for
      coordination of registry value assignments with the RFC
      Production Center. The IAOC will facilitate the establishment
      of the relationship between the RFC Production Center and IANA.
    </t>
    <t>
      This document does not create a new registry nor does it
      register any values in existing registries, and no IANA action
      is required.
    </t>

  </section>
  <section title="Security considerations">
    <t>
      The same security considerations as those in RFC 4844 apply. The
      processes for the publication of documents must prevent the
      introduction of unapproved changes. Since the RFC Editor
      maintains the index of publications, sufficient security must be
      in place to prevent these published documents from being changed
      by external parties. The archive of RFC documents, any source
      documents needed to recreate the RFC documents, and any
      associated original documents (such as lists of errata, tools,
      and, for some early items, non-machine readable originals) need
      to be secured against failure of the storage medium and other
      similar disasters.
    </t>
    <t>
     The IAOC should take these security considerations into
     account during the implementation of this RFC Editor model.
