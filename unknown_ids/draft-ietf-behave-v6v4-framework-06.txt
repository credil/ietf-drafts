Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2010


1.  Introduction

   This note describes a framework for IPv4/IPv6 translation.  This is
   in the context of replacing NAT-PT [RFC2766], which was deprecated by
   [RFC4966], and to enable networks to have IPv4 and IPv6 coexist in a
   somewhat rational manner while transitioning to an IPv6-only network.

   NAT-PT was deprecated to inform the community that NAT-PT had
   operational issues and was not considered a viable medium- or long-
   term strategy for either coexistence or transition.  It wasn't
   intended to say that IPv4<->IPv6 translation was bad, but the way
   that NAT-PT did it was bad, and in particular using NAT-PT as a
   general-purpose solution was bad.  As with the deprecation of the RIP
   routing protocol [RFC1923] at the time the Internet was converting to
   CIDR, the point was to encourage network operators to actually move
   away from technology with known issues.

   [RFC4213] describes the IETF's view of the most sensible transition
   model.  The IETF recommends, in short, that network operators
   (transit providers, service providers, enterprise networks, small and
   medium businesses, SOHO and residential customers, and any other kind
   of network that may currently be using IPv4) obtain an IPv6 prefix,
   turn on IPv6 routing within their networks and between themselves and
   any peer, upstream, or downstream neighbors, enable it on their
   computers, and use it in normal processing.  This should be done
   while leaving IPv4 stable, until a point is reached that any
   communication that can be carried out could use either protocol
   equally well.  At that point, the economic justification for running
   both becomes debatable, and network operators can justifiably turn
   IPv4 off.  This process is comparable to that of [RFC4192], which
   describes how to renumber a network using the same address family
   without a flag day.  While running stably with the older system,
   deploy the new.  Use the coexistence period to work out such kinks as
   arise.  When the new is also running stably, shift production to it.
   When network and economic conditions warrant, remove the old, which
   is now no longer necessary.

   The question arises: what if that is infeasible due to the time
   available to deploy or other considerations?  What if the process of
   moving a network and its components or customers is starting too late
   for contract cycles to affect IPv6 turn-up on important parts at a
   point where it becomes uneconomical to deploy global IPv4 addresses
   in new services?  How does one continue to deploy new services
   without balkanizing the network?

   This document describes translation as one of the tools networks
   might use to facilitate coexistence and ultimate transition.

1.1.  Why Translation?

   Besides dual-stack deployment, there are two fundamental approaches
   one could take to interworking between IPv4 and IPv6: tunneling and
   translation.  One could - and in the 6NET we did - build an overlay
   network that tunnels one protocol over the other.  Various proposals
   take that model, including 6to4 [RFC3056], Teredo [RFC4380], ISATAP
   [RFC5214], and DS-Lite [I-D.durand-softwire-dual-stack-lite].  The
   advantage of doing so is that the new is enabled to work without
   disturbing the old protocol, providing connectivity between users of
   the new protocol.  There are two disadvantages to tunneling:

   o  Users of the new architecture that don't support the old protocol,
      and those users are unable to use the services of the underlying
      infrastructure - it is just bandwidth, and

   o  It doesn't enable new protocol users to communicate with old
      protocol users without dual-stack hosts.

   As noted, in this work, we look at Internet Protocol translation as a
   transition strategy.  [RFC4864] forcefully makes the point that many
   of the reasons people use Network Address Translators are met as well
   by routing or protocol mechanisms that preserve the end-to-end
   addressability of the Internet.  What it did not consider is the case
   in which there is an ongoing requirement to communicate with IPv4
   systems, but for example configuring IPv4 routing is not in the
   network operator's view the most desirable strategy, or is infeasible
   due to a shortage of global address space.  Translation enables the
   client of a network, whether a transit network, an access network, or
   an edge network, to access the services of the network and
   communicate with other network users regardless of their protocol
   usage - within limits.  Like NAT-PT, IPv4/IPv6 translation under this
   rubric is not a long-term support strategy, but it is a medium-term
   coexistence strategy that can be used to facilitate a long-term
   program of transition.

1.2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document and other
   documents related to it.

   An IPv4 network:  A specific network that has an IPv4-only
      deployment.  This could be an enterprise's IPv4-only network, an
      ISP's IPv4-only network or even an IPv4-only host.  The IPv4
      Internet is the set of all interconnected IPv4 networks.

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2010


   An IPv6 network:  A specific network that has an IPv6-only
      deployment.  This could be an enterprise's IPv6-only network, an
      ISP's IPv6-only network or even an IPv6-only host.  The IPv6
      Internet is the set of all interconnected IPv6 networks.

   DNS46:  A DNS translator that translates AAAA record to A record.

   DNS64:  A DNS translater that translates A record to AAAA record.

   Dual-Stack implementation:  A Dual-Stack implementation, in this
      context, comprises an IPv4/IPv6 enabled end system stack,
      applications plus routing in the network.  It implies that two
      application instances are capable of communicating using either
      IPv4 or IPv6 - they have stacks, they have addresses, and they
      have any necessary network support including routing.

   IPv4-converted addresses:  They are IPv6 addresses used to represent
      IPv4 addresses.  They have an explicit mapping relationship to
      IPv4 addresses.  Both stateless and stateful translators use IPv4-
      converted addresses to represent IPv4 addresses.

   IPv4-only:  An IPv4-only implementation, in this context, comprises
      an IPv4-enabled end system stack, applications directly or
      indirectly using that IPv6 stack, plus routing in the network.  It
      implies that two application instances are capable of
      communicating using IPv4, but not IPv6 - they have an IPv4 stack,
      addresses, and network support including IPv4 routing and
      potentially IPv4/IPv4 translation, but some element is missing
      that prevents communication with IPv6 hosts.

   IPv4-translatable addresses:  They are the IPv6 addresses to be
      assigned to IPv6 nodes behind one or more stateless translators.
      They have an explicit mapping relationship to IPv4 addresses.  A
      stateless translator uses the corresponding IPv4 addresses to
      represent the IPv6 addresses.  A stateful translator does not use
      this kind of addresses, since IPv6 hosts are represented by the
      IPv4 address pool in the translator via dynamic state.

   IPv6-only:  An IPv6-only implementation, in this context, comprises
      an IPv6-enabled end system stack, applications directly or
      indirectly using that IPv6 stack, plus routing in the network.  It
      implies that two application instances are capable of
      communicating using IPv6, but not IPv4 - they have an IPv6 stack,
      addresses, and network support including routing in IPv6, but some
      element is missing that prevents communication with IPv4 hosts.

   Network-Specific Prefix (NSP):  From an IPv6 prefix assigned to a
      network operator, the operator chooses a longer prefix for use by
      the operator's translator(s).  Hence a given IPv4 address would
      have different IPv6 representations in different networks that use
      different network-specific prefixes.  A network-specific prefix is
      also known as a Local Internet Registry (LIR) prefix.

   State:  "State" refers to dynamic information that is stored in a
      network element.  For example, if two systems are communicating
      using a TCP connection, each stores information about the
      connection, which is called "connection state".  In this context,
      the term refers to dynamic correlations between IP addresses on
      either side of a translator, or {IP address, transport protocol,
      transport port number} tuples on either side of the translator.
      Of stateful algorithms, there are at least two major flavors
      depending on the kind of state they maintain:

      Hidden state:  the existence of this state is unknown outside the
         network element that contains it.

      Known state:  the existence of this state is known by other
         network elements.

   Stateful Translation:  A translation algorithm may be said to
      "require state in a network element" or be "stateful" if the
      transmission or reception of a packet creates or modifies a data
      structure in the relevant network element.

   Stateful Translator:  A translator that uses stateful translation for
      either the source or destination address.  A stateful translator
      typically also uses a stateless translation algorithm for the
      other type of address.

   Stateless Translation:  A translation algorithm that is not
      "stateful" is "stateless".  It derives its needed information
      algorithmically from the messages it is translating, and pre-
      configured information.

   Stateless Translator:  A translator that uses only stateless
      translation for both destination address and source address.

   Well-Known Prefix (WKP):  A prefix assigned by IANA.  In this case,
      there would be a single representation of a public IPv4 address in
      the IPv6 address space.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.3.  Translation Objectives

   In any translation model, there is a question of objectives.
   Ideally, one would like to make any system and any application
   running on it able to "talk with" - exchange datagrams supporting
   applications with - any other system running the same application
   regardless of whether they have an IPv4 stack and connectivity or
   IPv6 stack and connectivity.  That was the model for NAT-PT, and the
   things it necessitated led to scaling and operational difficulties
   [RFC4966].

   So the question comes back to what different kinds of connectivity
   can be easily supported and what kinds are harder, and what
   technologies are needed to at least pick the low-hanging fruit.  We
   observe that applications today fall into two main categories:

   Client/Server Application:  Per whatis.com, "'Client/server'
      describes the relationship between two computer programs in which
      one program, the client, makes a service request from another
      program, the server, which fulfills the request."  In networking,
      the behavior of the applications is that connections are initiated
      from client software and systems to server software and systems.
      Examples include mail handling between an end user and his mail
      system (POP3, IMAP, and MUA->MTA SMTP), FTP, the web, and DNS name
      resolution.

   Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Application:  A P2P application is an application
      that uses the same endpoint to initiate outgoing sessions to
      peering hosts as well as accept incoming sessions from peering
      hosts.  These in turn fall broadly into two categories:

      Peer-to-peer infrastructure applications:  Examples of
         "infrastructure applications" include SMTP between MTAs,
         Network News, and SIP.  Any MTA might open an SMTP session with
         any other at any time; any SIP Proxy might similarly connect
         with any other SIP Proxy.  An important characteristic of these
         applications is that they use ephemeral sessions - they open
         sessions when they are needed and close them when they are
         done.

      Peer-to-peer file exchange applications:  Examples of these
         include Limewire, BitTorrent, and UTorrent.  These are
         applications that open some sessions between systems and leave
         them open for long periods of time, and where ephemeral
         sessions are important, are able to learn about the reliability
         of peers from history or by reputation.  They use the long-term
         sessions to map content availability.  Short-term sessions are
         used to exchange content.  They tend to prefer to ask for

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2010


         content from servers that they find reliable and available.

   If the goal is the ability to open connections between systems, then
   one must ask who opens connections.

   o  We need a technology that will enable systems that act as clients
      to be able to open sessions with other systems that act as
      servers, whether in the IPv6->IPv4 direction or the IPv4->IPv6
      direction.  Ideally, this is stateless; especially in a carrier
      infrastructure, the preponderance of accesses will be to servers,
      and this optimizes access to them.  However, a stateful algorithm
      is acceptable if the complexity is minimized and a stateless
      algorithm cannot be constructed.

   o  We also need a technology that will allow peers to connect with
      each other, whether in the IPv6->IPv4 direction or the IPv4->IPv6
      direction.  Again, it would be ideal if this was stateless, but a
      stateful algorithm is acceptable if the complexity is minimized
      and a stateless algorithm cannot be constructed.

   o  In some situations, hosts are purely clients.  In those
      situations, we do not need an algorithm to enable connections to
      those hosts.

   The complexity arguments bring us in the direction of hidden state:
   if state must be shared between the application and the translator or
   between translation components, complexity and deployment issues are
   greatly magnified.  The objective of the translators is to aviod, as
   much as possible, any software changes in hosts or applications
   necessary to support translation.

   NAT-PT is an example of a facility with known state - at least two
   software components (the data plane translator and the DNS
   Application Layer Gateway, which may be implemented in the same or
   different systems) share and must coordinate translation state.  A
   typical IPv4/IPv4 NAT implements an algorithm with hidden state.
   Obviously, stateless translation requires less computational overhead
   than stateful translation, and less memory to maintain the state,
   because the translation tables and their associated methods and
   processes exist in a stateful algorithm and don't exist in a
   stateless one.

1.4.  Transition Plan

   While the design of IPv4 made it impossible for IPv6 to be compatible
   on the wire, the designers intended that it would coexist with IPv4
   during a period of transition.  The primary mode of coexistence was
   dual-stack operation - routers would be dual-stacked so that the

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2010


   network could carry both address families, and IPv6-capable hosts
   could be dual-stack to maintain access to IPv4-only partners.  The
   goal was that the preponderance of hosts and routers in the Internet
   would be IPv6-capable long before IPv4 address space allocation was
   completed.  At this time, it appears the exhaustion of IPv4 address
   space will occur before significant IPv6 adoption.

   Curran's "A Transition Plan for IPv6" [RFC5211] proposes a three-
   phase progression:

   Preparation Phase (current):  characterized by pilot use of IPv6,
      primarily through transition mechanisms defined in [RFC4213], and
      planning activities.

   Transition Phase (2010 through 2011):  characterized by general
      availability of IPv6 in provider networks which SHOULD be native
      IPv6; organizations SHOULD provide IPv6 connectivity for their
      Internet-facing servers, but SHOULD still provide IPv4-based
      services via a separate service name.

   Post-Transition Phase (2012 and beyond):  characterized by a
      preponderance of IPv6-based services and diminishing support for
      IPv4-based services.

   Various timelines have been discussed, but most will agree with the
   pattern of the above three transition phases, also known as an "S"
   curve transition pattern.

   In each of these phases, the coexistence problem and solution space
   has a different focus:

   Preparation Phase:  Coexistence tools are needed to facilitate early
      adopters by removing impediments to IPv6 deployment, and to assure
      that nothing is lost by adopting IPv6, in particular that the IPv6
      adopter has unfettered access to the global IPv4 Internet
      regardless of whether they have a global IPv4 address (or any IPv4
      address or stack at all).  While it might appear reasonable for
      the cost and operational burden to be borne by the early adopter,
      the shared goal of promoting IPv6 adoption would argue against
      that model.  Additionally, current IPv4 users should not be forced
      to retire or upgrade their equipment and the burden remains on
      service providers to carry and route native IPv4.  This is known
      as the early stage of the "S" curve.

   Transition Phase:  During the middle stage of "S" curve, while IPv6
      adoption can be expected to accelerate, there will still be a
      significant portion of the Internet operating IPv4-only or
      preferring IPv4.  During this phase the norm shifts from IPv4 to

      IPv6, and coexistence tools evolve to ensure interoperability
      between domains that may be restricted to IPv4 or IPv6.

   Post-Transition Phase:  This is the last stage of "S" curve.  In this
      phase, IPv6 is ubiquitous and the burden of maintaining
      interoperability shifts to those who choose to maintain IPv4-only
      systems.  While these systems should be allowed to live out their
      economic life cycles, the IPv4-only legacy users at the edges
      should bear the cost of coexistence tools, and at some point
      service provider networks should not be expected to carry and
      route native IPv4 traffic.

   The choice between the terms "transition" versus "coexistence" has
   engendered long philosophical debate.  "Transition" carries the sense
   that one is going somewhere, while "coexistence" seems more like one
   is sitting somewhere.  Historically with the IETF, "transition" has
   been the term of choice [RFC4213][RFC5211], and the tools for
   interoperability have been called "transition mechanisms".  There is
   some perception or conventional wisdom that adoption of IPv6 is being
   impeded by the deficiency of tools to facilitate interoperability of
   nodes or networks that are constrained (in some way, fully or
   partially) from full operation in one of the address families.  In
   addition, it is apparent that transition will involve a period of
   coexistence; the only real question is how long that will last.

   Thus, coexistence is an integral part of the transition plan, not in
   conflict with it, but there will be a balancing act.  It starts out
   being a way for early IPv6 adopters to easily exploit the bigger IPv4
   Internet, and ends up being a way for late/never adopters to hang on
   with IPv4 (at their own expense, with minimal impact or visibility to
   the Internet).  One way to look at solutions is that cost incentives
   (both monetary cost and the operational overhead for the end user)
   should encourage IPv6 and discourage IPv4.  That way natural market
   forces will keep the transition moving - especially as the legacy
   IPv4-only stuff ages out of use.  There will come a time to set a
   date after which no one is obligated to carry native IPv4 but it
   would be premature to attempt to do so yet.  The end goal should not
   be to eliminate IPv4 by fiat, but rather render it redundant through
   ubiquitous IPv6 deployment.  IPv4 may never go away completely, but
   rational plans should move the costs of maintaining IPv4 to those who
   insist on using it after wide adoption of IPv6.


2.  Scenarios for IPv4/IPv6 Translation

   It is important to note that the choice of translation solution and
   the assumptions about the network where they are used impact the
   consequences.  A translator for the general case has a number of

   issues that a translator for a more specific situation may not have
   at all.

   The intention of this document is to focus on translation solutions
   under all kinds of situations.  All IPv4/IPv6 translation cases can
   be easily described in terms of "interoperation between a set of
   systems (applications) that only communicate using IPv4 and a set of
   systems that only communicate using IPv6", but the differences at a
   detailed level make them interesting.

   Based on the transition plan described in Section 1.4, there are four
   types of IPv4/IPv6 translation scenarios:

   a.  Interoperation between an IPv6 network and the IPv4 Internet

   b.  Interoperation between an IPv4 network and the IPv6 Internet

   c.  Interoperation between an IPv6 network and an IPv4 network

   d.  Interoperation between the IPv6 Internet and the IPv4 Internet

   Each one of the above can be divided into two scenarios, depending on
   whether the IPv6 side or the IPv4 side initiates communication, so
   there are a total of eight scenarios.

   Scenario 1: an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet

   Scenario 2: the IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network

   Scenario 3: the IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 network

   Scenario 4: an IPv4 network to the IPv6 Internet

   Scenario 5: an IPv6 network to an IPv4 network

   Scenario 6: an IPv4 network to an IPv6 network

   Scenario 7: the IPv6 Internet to the IPv4 Internet

   Scenario 8: the IPv4 Internet to the IPv6 Internet

   We will discuss each scenario in detail in the next section.

2.1.  Scenario 1: an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet

   Due to the lack of IPv4 addresses or under other technical or
   economical constraints, the network is IPv6-only, but the hosts in
   the network require communicating with the global IPv4 Internet.



Baker, et al.            Expires August 11, 2010               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2010


   This is the typical scenario for what we sometimes call "green-field"
   deployments.  One example is an enterprise network that wishes to
   operate only IPv6 for operational simplicity, but still wishes to
   reach the content in the IPv4 Internet.  The green-field enterprise
   scenario is different from an ISP's network in the sense that there
   is only one place that the enterprise can easily modify: the border
   between its network and the IPv4 Internet.  Obviously, the IPv4
   Internet operates the way it already does.  But in addition, the
   hosts in the enterprise network are commercially available devices,
   personal computers with existing operating systems.  This restriction
   drives us to a "one box" type of solution, where IPv6 can be
   translated into IPv4 to reach the public Internet.

   Other cases that have been mentioned include wireless ISP networks
   and sensor networks.  These bear a striking resemblance to this
   scenario as well, if one considers the ISP network to simply be a
   very special kind of enterprise network.

   1.

2.2.  Scenario 2: the IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network

   When the enterprise networks or ISP networks adopt Scenario 1, the
   IPv6-only users will not only want to access servers on the IPv4
   Internet but also want to setup their own servers in the network
   which are accessable by the users on the IPv4 Internet, since the
   majority of the Internet users are still in the IPv4 Internet.  Thus,
   with a translation solution for this scenario, the benefits would be
   clear.  Not only could servers move directly to IPv6 without trudging

   through a difficult transition period, but they could do so without
   risk of losing connectivity with the IPv4-only Internet.

                           Figure 2: Scenario 2

   In general, this scenario presents a hard case for translation.
   Stateful translation such as NAT-PT [RFC2766] can be used in this
   scenario, but it requires a tightly coupled DNS ALG in the translator
   and this technique was deprecated by the IETF [RFC4966].

   The stateless translation solution [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] in
   Scenario 1 can also work in Scenario 2, since it can support IPv4-
   initiated communications with a subset of the IPv6 addresses (IPv4-
   translatable addresses) in an IPv6 network.

2.3.  Scenario 3: the IPv6 Internet to an IPv4 network

   There is a requirement for a legacy IPv4 network to provide services
   to IPv6 hosts.

                           Figure 3: Scenario 3

   Stateless translation will not work for this scenario, because an
   IPv4 network needs to communicate with all of the IPv6 Internet, not
   just a small subset, and stateless can only support a subset of the
   IPv6 addresses.  However, IPv6-initiated communication can be
   achieved through stateful translation
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].

2.4.  Scenario 4: an IPv4 network to the IPv6 Internet

   Due to technical or economical constraints, the network is IPv4-only,
   and IPv4-only hosts (applications) may require communicating with the
   global IPv6 Internet.

                           Figure 4: Scenario 4

   scenario, but it requires a tightly coupled DNS ALG in the translator
   and this technique was deprecated by the IETF [RFC4966].

   From the transition phase discussion in Section 1.4, this scenario
   will probably only occur when we are well past the early stage of the
   "S" curve and the IPv4/IPv6 transition has already moved to the right
   direction.  Therefore, in-network translation is not considered
   viable for this scenario and other techniques should be considered.

2.5.  Scenario 5: an IPv6 network to an IPv4 network

   In this scenario, both an IPv4 network and an IPv6 network are within
   the same organization.

   The IPv4 addresses used are either public IPv4 addresses or [RFC1918]
   addresses.  The IPv6 addresses used are either public IPv6 addresses
   or ULAs (Unique Local Addresses) [RFC4193].

   The translation requirement from this scenario has no significant
   difference from scenario 1, so both the stateful and stateless
   translation schemes discussed in Section 2.1 apply here.

2.6.  Scenario 6: an IPv4 network to an IPv6 network

   This is another scenario when both an IPv4 network and an IPv6
   network are within the same organization.

   The IPv4 addresses used are either public IPv4 addresses or [RFC1918]
   addresses.  The IPv6 addresses used are either public IPv6 addresses
   or ULAs (Unique Local Addresses) [RFC4193].

   The translation requirement from this scenario has no significant
   difference from scenario 2, so the translation scheme discussed in
   Section 2.2 applies here.

2.7.  Scenario 7: the IPv6 Internet to the IPv4 Internet

   This seems the ideal case for in-network translation technology,
   where any IPv6-only host or application on the global Internet can
   initiate communication with any IPv4-only host or application on the
   global Internet.

                           Figure 7: Scenario 7

   Due to the huge difference in size between the address spaces of the
   IPv4 Internet and the IPv6 Internet, there is no viable translation
   technique to handle unlimited IPv6 address translation.

   If we ever run into this scenario, fortunately, the IPv4/IPv6
   transition has already passed the early stage of the "S" curve.
   Therefore, there is no obvious business reason to demand a
   translation solution as the only transition strategy.

   This case is very similar to Scenario 7.  The analysis and

3.  Framework

   Having laid out the preferred transition model and the options for
   implementing it (Section 1.1), defined terms (Section 1.2),
   considered the requirements (Section 1.3), considered the transition
   model (Section 1.4), and considered the kinds of scenarios the
   facility would support (Section 2), we now turn to a framework for
   IPv4/IPv6 translation.  The framework contains the following
   components:

   o  Address translation

   o  IP and ICMP translation

   o  Maintaining translation state

   o  DNS64 and DNS46

3.1.  Translation Components

3.1.1.  Address Translation

   When IPv6/IPv4 translation is performed, we should specify how an
   individual IPv6 address is translated to a corresponding IPv4
   address, and vice versa, in cases where an algorithmic mapping is
   used.  This includes the choice of IPv6 prefix and the choice of
   method by which the remainder of the IPv6 address is derived from an
   IPv4 address [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].

   Note that translating IPv4 addresses to IPv6 addresses and
   translating IPv6 addresses to IPv4 addresses are different for
   stateless translation and stateful translation.

   o  For stateless translation, an algorithmic mapping table is used to
      translate IPv6 destination addresses (IPv4-converted addresses) to
      IPv4 destination addresses in IPv6 to IPv4 direction and translate
      IPv4 source addresses to IPv6 source addresses (IPv4-converted
      addresses) in IPv4 to IPv6 direction.  The same algorithmic
      mapping table is used to translate IPv6 source addresses (IPv4-
      translatable addresses) to IPv4 source addresses in IPv6 to IPv4
      direction and translate IPv4 destination addresses to IPv6
      destination addresses (IPv4-translatable addresses) in IPv4 to
      IPv6 direction.  In this case, blocks of service provider's IPv4
      addresses are mapped into IPv6 and used by physical IPv6 nodes.
      The original IPv4 form of these blocks of service provider's IPv4
      addresses are used to represent the physical IPv6 nodes in IPv4.
      Note that stateless translation supports both IPv6 initiated as
      well as IPv4 initiated communications.

   o  For stateful translation, an algorithmic mapping table is used to
      translate IPv6 destination addresses (IPv4-converted addresses) to
      IPv4 destination addresses in IPv6 to IPv4 direction and translate
      IPv4 source addresses to IPv6 source addresses (IPv4-converted
      addresses) in IPv4 to IPv6 direction.  A state table is used to
      translate IPv6 source addresses to IPv4 source addresses in IPv6
      to IPv4 direction and translate IPv4 destination addresses to IPv6
      destination addresses in IPv4 to IPv6 direction.  In this case,
      blocks of the service provider's IPv4 addresses are maintained in
      the translator as the IPv4 address pools and are dynamically bound
      to specific IPv6 addresses.  The original IPv4 form of these
      blocks of service provider's IPv4 addresses is used to represent
      the IPv6 address in IPv4.  However, due to the dynamic binding,
      stateful translation in general only supports IPv6-initiated
      communication.

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2010


3.1.2.  IP and ICMP Translation

   The IPv4/IPv6 translator is based on the update to the Stateless IP/
   ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT) described in [RFC2765].  The
   algorithm translates between IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers (including
   ICMP headers).

   The IP and ICMP translation document [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate]
   discusses header translation for both stateless and stateful modes,
   but does not cover maintaining state in the stateful mode.  In the
   stateless mode, translation information is carried in the address
   itself plus configuration in the translator, permitting both
   IPv4->IPv6 and IPv6->IPv4 session establishment.  In the stateful
   mode, translation state is maintained between IPv4 address/transport
   port tuples and IPv6 address/transport port tuples, enabling IPv6
   systems to open sessions with IPv4 systems.  The choice of
   operational mode is made by the operator deploying the network and is
   critical to the operation of the applications using it.

3.1.3.  Maintaining Translation State

   For the stateful translator, besides IP and ICMP translation, special
   action must be taken to maintain the translation states.
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful] describes a mechanism for
   maintaining state.

3.1.4.  DNS64 and DNS46

   DNS64 [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] and possible future DNS46 documents
   describe the mechanisms by which a DNS translator is intended to
   operate.  It is designed to operate on the basis of known address
   translation algorithms defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format]

   There are at least two possible implementations of a DNS64 and DNS46:

   Static records:  One could literally populate DNS with corresponding
      A and AAAA records.  This mechanism works for scenarios 2, 3, 5
      and 6.

   Dynamic Translation of static records:  In more general operation,
      the preferred behavior is an A record to be (retrieved and)
      translated to an AAAA record by the DNS64 if and only if no
      reachable AAAA record exists, or for an AAAA record to be
      (retrieved and) translated to an A record by the DNS46 if and only
      if no reachable A record exists.

3.1.5.  ALGs for Other Applications Layer Protocols

   In addition, some applications require special support.  An example
   is FTP.  FTP's active mode doesn't work well across NATs without
   extra support such as SOCKS [RFC1928] [RFC3089].  Across NATs, it
   generally uses passive mode.  However, the designers of FTP wrote
   different and incompatible passive mode implementations for IPv4 and
   IPv6 networks.  Hence, either they need to fix FTP, or a translator
   must be written for the application.  Other applications may be
   similarly broken.

   As a general rule, a simple operational recommendation will work
   around many application issues, which is that there should be a
   server in each domain or an instance of the server should have an
   interface in each domain.  For example, an SMTP MTA may be confused
   by finding an IPv6 address in its HELO when it is connected to using
   IPv4 (or vice versa), but would work perfectly well if it had an
   interface in both the IPv4 and IPv6 domains and was used as an
   application-layer bridge between them.

3.2.  Operation Mode for Specific Scenarios

   Currently, the proposed solutions for IPv6/IPv4 translation are
   classified into stateless translation and stateful translation.

3.2.1.  Stateless Translation

   For stateless translation, the translation information is carried in
   the address itself plus configuration in the translators, permitting
   both IPv4->IPv6 and IPv6->IPv4 session initiation.  Stateless
   translation supports end-to-end address transparency and has better
   scalability compared with stateful translation.
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate].

   Although the stateless translation mechanisms typically put
   constraints on what IPv6 addresses can be assigned to IPv6 nodes that
   want to communicate with IPv4 destinations using an algorithmic
   mapping.  For Scenario 1 ("an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet"), it
   is not a serious drawback, since the address assignment policy can be
   applied to satisfy this requirement for the IPv6 notes that need to
   communicate with the IPv4 Internet.  In addition, stateless
   translation supports Scenario 2 ("the IPv4 Internet to an IPv6
   network"), which means that not only could servers move directly to
   IPv6 without trudging through a difficult transition period, but they
   could do so without risk of losing connectivity with the IPv4-only
   Internet.

   Stateless translation can be used for Scenarios 1, 2, 5 and 6, i.e.,

   it supports "an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet", "the IPv4
   Internet to an IPv6 network", "an IPv6 network to an IPv4 network"
   and "an IPv4 network to an IPv6 network".

3.2.2.  Stateful Translation

   For stateful translation, the translation state is maintained between
   IPv4 address/port pairs and IPv6 address/port pairs, enabling IPv6

   systems to open sessions with IPv4 systems
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate] [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful].

   Stateful translator can be used for Scenarios 1, 3 and 5, i.e., it
   supports "an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet", "the IPv6 Internet
   to an IPv4 network" and "an IPv6 network to an IPv4 network".

   For Scenario 1, any IPv6 addresses in an IPv6 network can use
   stateful translation, however it typically only supports initiation
   from the IPv6 side itdoesn't support IPv4-initiation, and does not
   result in stable addresses of IPv6 nodes that can be used in DNS,
   other protocols and applications that do not deal well with highly
   dynamic addresses.

   and being reached from the IPv6 Internet basically includes the cases
   that for whatever reason the servers cannot be upgraded to IPv6 and
   they don't have public IPv4 addresses and it would be useful to allow
   IPv6 nodes in the IPv6 Internet to reach those servers.

4.  Translation in Operation

   Operationally, there are two ways that translation could be used - as
   a permanent solution making transition "the other guy's problem", and
   as a temporary solution for a new part of one's network while
   bringing up IPv6 services in the remaining parts of one's network.
   We obviously recommend the latter at the present stage.  For the IPv4
   parts of the network, [RFC4213]'s recommendation holds: bringing IPv6
   up in those domains, moving production to it, and then taking down
   the now-unnecessary IPv4 service when economics warrant remains the
   least risk approach to transition.

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2010


   combination of hosts - IPv6-only gaming devices and handsets, older
   computer operating systems that are IPv4-only, and modern mainline
   operating systems that support both, as well as a combination of
   applications including ones that are IPv4-only and modern
   applications that support both.  One also expects a combination of
   networks - dual-stack devices operating in single-stack networks are
   effectively single-stack, whether that stack is IPv4 or IPv6, as the
   other isn't providing communications services.


5.  Unsolved Problems

   This framework could support multicast; some discussions are in
   [I-D.venaas-behave-mcast46] and [I-D.xli-behave-ivi].

   This framework could support IPv4 address sharing for the stateless
   translation.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requires no parameter assignment by the IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
   correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are
   required, or if those assignments or registries are created during
   the RFC publication process.  From the author's perspective, it may
   therefore be removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor's
   discretion.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document is the framework of IPv4/IPv6 translation.  The
   security issues are addressed in individual IPv4/IPv6 translation
   documents, i.e.  [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format],
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate], [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful],
   [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64], [I-D.xli-behave-dns46-for-stateless] and
   [I-D.ietf-behave-ftp64].
