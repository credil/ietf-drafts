Internet-Draft                  PCP Proxy                     March 2011


1.  Introduction

   PCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] discusses the implementation of NAT control
   features that rely upon Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) devices such as DS-
   Lite AFTR [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite].

   The Customer Premise router, the B4 is DS-Lite, is in charge to
   enforce some security controls on PCP requests so implements a PCP
   Proxy function, i.e., it acts as a PCP server receiving PCP requests
   on internal interfaces, and as a PCP client forwarding accepted PCP
   requests on an external interface to a CGN PCP server which answers
   by PCP responses the Proxy sends back to PCP clients on Internal
   hosts.

   The Proxy can be simple, i.e., implement as transparent/minimal
   processing as possible, or it can be smart, i.e., handle multiple CGN
   PCP servers, cache requests/responses, etc.  A smart Proxy can be
   associated with UPnP IGD [I-D.bpw-pcp-upnp-igd-interworking] or/and
   NAT-PMP [I-D.bpw-pcp-nat-pmp-interworking] Interworking Function.

2.  PCP Server Discovery and Provisioning

   The PCP Proxy MUST implement one of the discovery methods listed in
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] (e.g., DHCP [I-D.bpw-pcp-dhcp]).

   The address of the PCP Proxy is provisioned to local PCP Clients as
   their default PCP Server: If the PCP DHCP option is supported by an
   internal PCP Client, it will retrieve from its CP router the IP
   address to use when issuing its PCP requests (i.e., the address of
   the PCP Proxy); otherwise internal PCP Clients will assume their

   default router being the PCP Server.

   The PCP Proxy MUST use 44323 to listen to incoming PCP requests from
   internal PCP Clients.  If a distinct port is used and unless this
   port is configure by some means, PCP communications will fail.


3.  Control of the Firewall

   A security policy to accept PCP messages from the provisioned PCP
   Server are to be enabled on the CP router.  This policy can be for
   instance triggered by DHCP configuration or by outbound PCP requests
   issued from the PCP Proxy to the provisioned PCP Server.

   In order to accept inbound and outbound traffic associated with PCP
   mappings instantiated in the upstream PCP Server, appropriate
   security policies are to be configured on the firewall.


4.  PCP Proxy Interface

   A PCP Proxy should be bound to a LAN interface.

   The PCP Proxy SHOULD NOT accept requests coming from the WAN
   interfaces of the CP router.


5.  PCP Proxy Without NAT in the CP Router

   When no NAT is embedded in the CP router, the port number included in
   received PCP messages (from the PCP Server or PCP Client(s)) are not
   altered by the PCP Proxy.


6.  PCP Proxy With NAT Embedded in the CP Router

   When the PCP Proxy is co-located with a NAT function in the CP
   router, it MUST update the content of received mapping messages with
   the port number belonging to the external interface of the CP router
   (i.e., after the NAT operation) and not as initially positioned by
   the PCP Client.  For the reverse path, PCP response messages are
   intercepted by the PCP Proxy to replace the target port number to
   what has been initially positioned by the PCP Client.  A NAT state is
   required to be maintained by the PCP Proxy (or NAT) for this purpose.

   The PCP Proxy MUST update the requested lifetime value of the PCP
   request to be at least equal to the validity timer of the
   corresponding NAT binding in the CP router.  If the PCP Server.

   Because the PCP Server may grant a lifetime smaller or larger than
   the requested lifetime, the PCP Proxy should update the local state
   to avoid the NAT binding lifetime be smaller than the one assigned by
   the terminating PCP Server (as positioned in the assigned-lifetime
   field).

6.1.  Change of the WAN IP Address

   When a new IP address is assigned to the WAN interface, the mappings
   instructed by internal PCP Clients are to be updated in the PCP
   Server.  Two solutions may be considered:
   1.  If a mapping table is stored locally, the PCP Proxy proceeds to
       update all the mappings on behalf of the PCP Client.  This option
       is transparent for the PCP Clients.
   2.  Or an advertisement mechanism is implemented locally to force PCP
       Client refresh their mappings.


7.  Simple PCP Proxy

   A simple PCP Proxy performs minimal modifications to PCP requests and
   responses, in particular it does not change the Epoch value in
   responses.  So it does not handle more than one PCP server.

7.1.  Simple PCP Proxy Behaviour

   Unless THIRD_PARTY option is present, the Target IP Address is
   assumed to be equal to the source IP address of a received PCP
   request.

   A PCP Proxy can be configured to accept or to reject PCP requests
   including THIRD_PARTY option enclosing an IP address distinct than
   the source IP address of the request.

   When third-party mappings are not allowed, the detailed behavior at
   the reception of a PCP request on an internal interface is as
   follows:

   o  apply security controls.
   o  if the request is rejected, build a fake error response and send
      it back to the PCP client.
   o  if the request is accepted, adjust it and forward it on a fresh
      UDP socket connected to the PCP server.  Wait for the response
      during a reasonable delay.  If a NAT is co-located with the PCP
      Proxy, the Target Port Number MUST be updated as specified in
      Section 6.

   o  when the response is received from the PCP server, adjust it back
      and forward it to the source PCP client.  The PCP Proxy MUST
      enforce request validation rules to check whether a request has
      been issued to that PCP Server.
   o  on a hard error on the UDP socket, build a fake ICMP error and
      send it to the source PCP client.

   The reasonable delay minimum value is 20 seconds, request
   retransmission is handled by PCP clients.

   For each pending request, the proxy MUST maintain in a data record:

   o  the request payload
   o  the interface where the request was received
   o  the source IP address of the request
   o  the source UDP port of the request
   o  the UDP socket connected to the PCP server
   o  an expire timeout

   Receiving interfaces can be implemented by a set of servicing
   sockets, each socket bound to an address of an internal interface.
   Interface, source address and port are used to send back packets to
   the source PCP client.  The request payload is used to generate fake
   ICMP.  Responses are received on the UDP socket.

   There is no (not yet) standardized way to build a fake error
   response, in particular no way to determine which Epoch value to put
   into it.  This is why it is better to build a fake ICMP error than a
   fake error response with NETWORK_FAILURE on a socket hard error.

7.2.  Unsupported PCP Options

   The simple PCP Proxy MUST ignore any unknown PCP Option received in
   PCP messages and proxy these PCP messages following the procedure
   specified above.

7.3.  Unsupported PCP OpCodes

   When the PCP Proxy is not co-located with a NAT, the simple PCP Proxy
   MUST proceed to the security validation operations when handling
   received unknown PCP OpCodes.

   When the PCP Proxy is co-located with a NAT, unknown PCP OpCode may
   enclose the target port number.  Proxying an Unknown PCP Opcode
   without updating the content of message may lead to failures.  For
   this reason, a PCP Client behind a NAT to detect the presence of a
   NAT in the path and to position its target port accordingly.

7.4.  PCP Message Truncation

   The PCP Proxy MUST NOT truncate PCP messages below the packet size
   limit specified in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].

7.5.  Secure Transport Mode

   A simple PCP Proxy is not supposed to manage PCP communications with
   different transport modes in each communication side (e.g., DTLS in
   once side and UDP in the other one).

   Simple PCP Proxy is supposed to use UDP in both communication legs as
   this is the default transport protocol used in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].


8.  Smart Proxy

   When a simple PCP Proxy uses as global variables only the CGN PCP
   server IP address, a set of servicing sockets and a list of pending
   request handlers, a smart PCP Proxy implements more services.

   [[To be elaborated further: - multiple PCP servers - Epoch handling
   [I-D.boucadair-pcp-failure] - request/response caching -
   retransmission - keeping the full state]]


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


10.  Security Considerations

   The security controls are applied on PCP requests and are about:
   o  authorized target addresses, in particular in case of a third
      party.
   o  authorized internal and external ports (note the external port is
      in general assigned by the CGN PCP server).

   Requests for a third party are not allowed by default.
