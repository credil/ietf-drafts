2.  Introduction

   Researchers and engineers often wish to analyze network behavior by
   studying routing protocol transactions and routing information base
   snapshots in relation to geographical topologies.  Usually the Border
   Gateway Protocol [RFC4271] is the subject of study and the analysis
   can be significantly aided by the availability and extension of the
   "Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit (MRT) format" [I-D.ietf-grow-mrt].
   The MRT format was originally defined in the Multi-threaded Routing
   Toolkit Programmer's Guide [MRT-GUIDE].

   The addition of geo-location coordinates (longitude and latitude)
   pertaining to the geographical location of both the BGP collector and
   its BGP peers to BGP export data enables a researcher or enquiring
   individual to gain a tererestrial insight to the routes seen by a BGP
   speaker.  Such data may ultimately aide reserachers in understanding
   any disparity between the geographical location of networks and the
   topological location of networks in addition to the relationships
   between geographical position and routing anomolies.  Such insight
   could provide future input into network design or network security.

   This memo documents an extension to the "MRT format"
   [I-D.ietf-grow-mrt] and introduces an additional definition of a MRT
   subtype field that includes the terestrial coordinates of a BGP
   Collector and its BGP Peers.

4.  Geo-location aware MRT Routing Information Subtype

   An additional subtype (GEO_PEER_TABLE) is defined for the
   TABLE_DUMP_v2 format, extending TABLE_DUMP_V2 Type.

4.1.  GEO_PEER_TABLE

   The GEO_PEER_TABLE Subtype updates the TABLE_DUMP_v2 Types to include
   Geo-location information in the form of WGS84 [WGS-84] formatted
   coordinates.

   The document adds the 7th subtype number and name below.  The first 6
   subtypes are defined by the "MRT format" [I-D.ietf-grow-mrt].

   Subtype Number       Subtype Name
   ----------------------------------
       7               GEO_PEER_TABLE

   The GEO_PEER_TABLE MRT record provides the BGP ID of the collector,
   its latitude and longitude in WGS84 [WGS-84] format, and a list of
   indexed peers and their respective latitudes and longitudes in WGS84
   [WGS-84] format.

   The format and function of the Collector BGP ID, Peer Count are as
   defined by the TABLE_DUMP_V2 PEER_INDEX_TABLE format.
   [I-D.ietf-grow-mrt].

   The Collector Latitude and Collector Longitude are the geographical
   coordinates of the collector in WGS84 [WGS-84] datum decimal degrees
   format stored as a single precision float in the 32 bits allocated to
   the Collector Latitude and Collector Longitude.  The latitude and
   longitude MAY be a Not A Number (NAN) [IEEE754] for situations where
   the geo-location of the collector is considered private.  The
   Collector Latitude and Collector Longitude MUST NOT be a mix of WGS84
   [WGS-84] datum coordinate and NAN values.

                       Format of the GEO_PEER_TABLE

   The format of the peer entries is shown below.  The Peer Type and the
   Peer BGP ID is as defined in the TABLE_DUMP_V2 MRT
   [I-D.ietf-grow-mrt] PEER_INDEX_TABLE format.  The order of the Peer
   entries in GEO_PEER_TABLE MUST match the order and number as existing
   in the PEER_INDEX_TABLE.

5.  BGP Collector Construction

   This section is to aide the reader in understanding the function of a
   BGP collector.

   The BGP Collector is a device (hardware or software based) which
   speaks the Border Gateway Protocol and its intended function is to
   store (and archive) the BGP routing data it receives from other BGP
   speakers it has peering relationships with, providing data for later
   analysis.  The general nature of a BGP Collector is that it is a
   passive device in that it listens to route updates, and does not
   announce nor propagate any information it knows or receives.  It
   should be noted that this is not always the case, network operators
   sometimes enable the collection of BGP routing data on active BGP
   speakers to obtain a situational view of the routing system as they
   see it at a particular point in time.

   As a fully fledged BGP speaker the BGP Collector can fit into any BGP
   topology including iBGP, eBGP, and so on.  The implementation of a
   BGP collector in a network topology is therefore limited by that
   network's use of BGP.

8.  Security Considerations

   This extension to the "MRT format" [I-D.ietf-grow-mrt] defines fields
   that are of a descriptive nature and provide information that is
   useful in the analysis of routing systems.  As such, the author
   believes that they do not constitute an additional security risk.  It
   is recommended that the operators of the BGP collector and BGP peers
   consider their own privacy concerns before supplying geographical
   coordinates to BGP data collection systems.
