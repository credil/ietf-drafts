Internet-Draft    AAA for BB access in IPv6 transition         July 2011


1.  Introduction

   In the FAST6 architecture, there are various access types.  The user
   may be allocated with public IPv4 address, private IPv4 address, IPv6
   address or both IPv4 and IPv6 address.  In addition, the user may
   access to the network via CPE in bridged mode or routing mode.

   This document introduces access scenarios for FAST6 and analyzes the
   authentication, authorization and accounting operations in IPv4
   access network, IPv6 access network and dual stack network separately
   for PPPoE case.  The document focuses on the problems and possible
   solutions in the last two access scenarios.  Besides FAST6
   architecture, the solution described in this document also applies to
   the IPv6 smooth transition of most ISPs who uses PPPoE as access
   technology.


2.  Terminology

   BRAS:
      Broadband Remote Access Server, BRAS, is the aggregation point for
      the subscriber traffic.  It provides aggregation capabilities
      between the Access Network and the Metro Area Network.  Beyond
      aggregation, it is also the injection point for access
      authentication, policy management and IP QoS.

   CPE:
      Customer Premises Equipment, CPE, is the edge of Customer Premises
      Network.  In this document, there are two types of CPEs, which are
      in Routed mode and in Bridged mode.

   Subscriber:
      The client that is purchasing the DSL circuit from the Service
      Provider and is receiving the billing.


3.  Access Scenarios

   This section describes various access scenarios and basic flows in
   FAST6 architecture and operations of related elements, e.g., BRAS,
   CPE and Host.

3.1.  IPv4 access

   This scenario describes the case when allocating IPv4 address for the
   user.

   In the bridged mode CPE case, the host acquires IPv4 address directly



Tan, et al.              Expires January 5, 2012                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft    AAA for BB access in IPv6 transition         July 2011


   from BRAS via PPP LCP negotiation ([RFC1332]).

   In the routing mode CPE case, CPE acquires IPv4 address from BRAS via
   PPP IPCP negotiation and then allocates the private IPv4 address to
   the host via DHCP.  The IPv4 address CPE retrieves from BRAS is the
   WAN side address of CPE.

   BRAS may allocate public IPv4 address or private IPv4 address for the
   host/CPE based on the user type.  When private address is allocated,
   double level NAT (at both CPE and CGN) is needed for the host to
   access Internet.  We strongly suggest the addresses allocated to the
   host and CPE use different address segments.

3.2.  IPv6 access

   This scenario describes the IPv6 address allocation procedure.

   In the bridged mode CPE case, the host acquires the IPv6 address from
   BRAS directly.  After PPP LCP negotiation with BRAS, the host gets
   the interface ID via IPv6CP process and generates Link Local IPv6
   address.  The host acquires IPv6 prefix via Router Advertisement or
   DHCPv6 and generates global IPv6 address ([RFC5072]).  In this case,
   BRAS must determine the IPv6 prefix allocated to the host.  It is
   recommended that each host have different prefix.

   In the routing mode CPE case, CPE acquires IPv6 prefix from BRAS and
   allocates addresses to the host.  After PPP LCP negotiation with
   BRAS, CPE gets the interface ID via IPv6CP process and generates Link
   Local IPv6 address for the WAN side.  The CPE acquires IPv6 prefix
   via Router Advertisement or DHCPv6 and generates global IPv6 address
   for the WAN side (the operator manages CPE through this address).
   The LAN side IPv6 prefix of CPE is retrieved via DHCP-PD ([RFC4861]).
   The host acquires IPv6 prefix via Router Advertisement messages and
   generates global IPv6 address finally.  In this case, BRAS should
   determine the IPv6 prefix separately allocated to the WAN interface
   and LAN interface of CPE.  The prefix should be different for two
   interfaces.

3.3.  Dual Stack Access

   In the Dual Stack case, IPv4 and IPv6 connection should be both
   carried in one PPP session which can be taken as combining IPv4 and
   IPv6 access procedures.  The process of IPv4 access is consistent
   with section 3.1, while IPv6 access is consistent with section 3.2.
   The host/CPE initiates IPCP, IPv6CP and ND-RA procedures by sequence
   after PPP LCP negotiation with BRAS to allocate IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses.

4.  Authentication and Authorization

   This section describes the authentication and authorization procedure
   how BRAS acquires the user parameters, e.g., access type and address/
   prefix, via interaction with RADIUS server.

4.1.  User type differentiation

   In the FAST6 architecture, RADIUS server should identify the user
   type and send corresponding access parameters.  For example, the
   RADIUS server should send private address pool attribute to the user
   if private IPv4 address is needed.  The user types are defined as
   below:

   o  Public IPv4GBPoallocates public IPv4 address to the user.

   o  Private IPv4GBPoallocates private IPv4 address to the user.

   o  IPv6 OnlyGBPoallocates IPv6 address to the user.

   o  Dual stack with Public IPv4GBPoallocates public IPv4 address and
      IPv6 address to the user.

   o  Dual stack with Private IPv4GBPoallocates private IPv4 address and
      IPv6 address to the user.

   BRAS know the user type based on the "User-Type" attribute carried in
   the RADIUS Access Accept packet.  "User-Type" attribute is a non-
   standardized attribute and can be used as a private attribute before
   it becomes a standard.  BRAS allocates corresponding IP addresses
   based on the user type, e.g., allocates private IPv4 address for the
   Private IPv4 user and allocates IPv6 address for the IPv6 Only user.

   BRAS may also determine the user type based on other attributes
   carried in the Access Accept packet.  For example, when Framed-IP-
   Pool attribute is received only and the value is set to "public IPv4
   address pool", the user can be taken as Public IPv4 user.  When user
   receives Framed-IPv6-Pool attribute only, the user type is IPv6 Only.

   "User-Type" attribute can simplify the way how BRAS determines the
   user type.  In addition, BRAS can allocate appropriate IP addresses
   for the user even without the address pool attribute sent by RADIUS
   serve, if default address pool is defined by BRAS.  Therefore, using
   "User-Type" attribute is the better way to get the user type.

   BRAS can configure defaulted user type, that is to say, when there is
   no "User-Type" or other attributes related to address allocation in
   the access accept packet, the user type can be taken as a specific

Internet-Draft    AAA for BB access in IPv6 transition         July 2011


   one, e.g., configuring public IPv4 address as default.  In this case,
   BRAS can allocate address to the user from the defaulted public IPv4
   address pool even there is no attribute received from RADIUS server
   in the authentication procedure.

4.2.  IPv4 Authentication

   This section describes the attributes RADIUS server sent in the IPv4
   authentication procedure.

   For the user who does not need fixed IPv4 address, RADIUS server will
   send User-Type and Framed-IP-Pool ([RFC2865]) in the Access Accept
   packet and BRAS will allocate address to the user from the address
   pool.  For the user who needs fixed IPv4 address, RADIUS server will
   send User-Type and Framed-IP-Address in the Access Accept message and
   BRAS will allocate this address to the user.

   BRAS may configure default public IPv4 address and private IPv4
   address pool.  When there is no address pool attribute is received
   from RADIUS server, BRAS can allocate address to the user from the
   defaulted address pool.

4.3.  IPv6 Authentication

   This section describes the attributes RADIUS server sent in the IPv6
   authentication procedure.

   When routing mode CPE is used, the IPv6 prefix allocated to the WAN
   and LAN interfaces should be different.  BRAS should be able to
   configure IPv6 address pool separately for the WAN and LAN
   interfaces.  BRAS should negotiate with RADIUS server in advance to
   identify which pool is for WAN interface and which pool is for LAN
   interface.

   BRAS can also configure default pool for WAN and LAN interface and
   use the default pool when no IPv6 address pool attribute is returned
   by RADIUS server.

   IPv6 authorization operations will be described separately for
   bridged mode CPE and routing mode CPE.

4.3.1.  Bridged mode CPE access

   For the user who does not need fixed IPv6 prefix, RADIUS server will
   send User-Type and two Framed-IPv6-Pool ([RFC3162]) attributes in the
   Access Accept message.  One is for WAN interface, and the other is
   for LAN interface.  BRAS allocate IPv6 prefix to the user from the
   WAN address pool.  LAN address pool is not used in this case.

Internet-Draft    AAA for BB access in IPv6 transition         July 2011


   For the user who needs fixed IPv6 prefix, RADIUS server will send
   user-type and Framed-IPv6-Prefix attributes in the Access Accept
   message and BRAS will allocate this prefix to the user.

4.3.2.  Routing mode CPE access

   For the user who does not need fixed IPv6 prefix, RADIUS server will
   send User-Type and two Framed-IPv6-Pool attributes in the Access
   Accept message.  One is for WAN interface, and the other is for LAN
   interface.  BRAS allocate IPv6 prefix for the WAN interface from the
   WAN address pool.  When DHCP-PD request is initiated by CPE, BRAS
   allocates IPv6 prefix for the LAN interface from the LAN address
   pool.

   For the user who needs fixed IPv6 prefix, RADIUS server will send
   User-Type, Framed-IPv6-Prefix and Delegated-IPv6-Prefix ([RFC4818])
   attributes in the Access Accept message and BRAS will allocate the
   value of Framed-IPv6-Prefix to the WAN interface.  When DHCP-PD
   request is initiated by CPE, BRAS allocates the value of Delegated-
   IPv6-Prefix to the LAN interface.

4.4.  Dual Stack Authentication

   When the user type is dual stack, RADIUS server will send User-Type
   attribute (the value is Dual stack with Public IPv4 or Dual stack
   with Private IPv4) and related IPv4 and IPv6 attributes in the Access
   Accept message.  The detailed attribute usage is described in section
   4.3 and section 4.4.


5.  Accounting

   This section describes RADIUS accounting procedure and attributes
   transmitted in various access scenarios.

5.1.  IPv4 accounting

   BRAS send Accounting start message to the RADIUS server after
   completing IPCP process with host/CPE and send Accounting stop
   message when LCP link is disconnected.  The information reported
   includes User-Name, Framed-IP-Address, Acct-Session-Time and the
   attributes related to traffic ([RFC2866],[RFC2869]).

5.2.  IPv6 accounting

   BRAS set time-up mechanism after sending Router Advertisement
   messages to the host/CPE.  BRAS will send Accounting start to the
   RADIUS server when receiving DHCP-PD request from CPE and replying



Tan, et al.              Expires January 5, 2012                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    AAA for BB access in IPv6 transition         July 2011


   with Delegated IPv6 Prefix before time up.  Otherwise, BRAS need to
   send Accounting start after time-up.  The reason is that BRAS has no
   idea of the CPE mode and whether DHCP-PD request is sent by the user.

   BRAS will send Accounting stop message when LCP link is disconnected.

   The accounting attributes BRAS report include User-Name, Framed-
   Interface-Id (Interface ID of the host or CPE WAN side), Framed-IPv6-
   Prefix (IPv6 prefix of the host or CPE WAN side), Acct-Session-Time
   and the attributes related to traffic.  If the user is accessed via
   routing mode CPE, the attributes should also include Delegated-IPv6-
   Prefix (IPv6 prefix of CPE LAN side, that is IPv6 prefix of the
   host).

5.3.  Dual Stack Accounting

   There are already existing documents describing RADIUS attributes for
   IPv4 and IPv6 accounting.  However, there may be some problems for
   the accounting when dual stack traffic is carried in one PPP link.
   The existing RADIUS attribute could not identify which traffic
   attributes are for IPv4 and which are for IPv6 in one accounting
   packet.

   To identify IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, two separate accounting packets
   may be used to transmit individual accounting information.  For IPv4,
   BRAS will send Accounting start, Accounting update and Accounting
   stop to transmit IPv4 accounting information (refer to section 5.1).
   For IPv6, BRAS will send another group of Accounting start,
   Accounting update and Accounting stop to transmit IPv6 accounting
   information (refer to section 5.2).  RADIUS server determines IPv4
   and IPv6 accounting packet based on the Frame-IP-Address and Frame-
   IPv6-Prefix or Delegated-IPv6-Prefix in the packet.

   These two group of accounting packets can use the same session ID
   since IPv4 and IPv6 are carried in one PPP session and have the same
   Acct-Session-Id attributes.

   The advantage of this dual stack accounting is to achieve IPv4 and
   IPv6 separately without new RADIUS attributes.  While the
   disadvantage is that two groups of accounting messages are needed for
   one PPP session which adds burden for BRAS, RADIUS server and the
   network.

   8.   CPE gets IPv6 prefix of WAN interface via Neighbor Discovery and
        generates Global IPv6 address of WAN interface; CPE may also get
        IPv6 prefix from BRAS via DHCP.

   9.   CPE retrieves IPv6 prefix of LAN interface via DHCP-PD.

   10.  The host acquires IPv6 prefix via Neighbor Discovery and
        generates Global IPv6 address.

   11.  BRAS initiates IPv4 Accounting Start message, including user
        name and IPv4 address.

   12.  BRAS initiates IPv6 Accounting Start message, including user
        name and IPv6 prefix of host and CPE.

   13.  The host is connected to IPv4 and IPv6 network.

   14.  BRAS send IPv4 Accounting Stop message to the RADIUS server,
        which includes user name, IPv4 address, traffic and lifetime.

   15.  BRAS send IPv6 Accounting Stop message to the RADIUS server,
        which includes user name, IPv6 prefix of the host and CPE,
        traffic and lifetime.
