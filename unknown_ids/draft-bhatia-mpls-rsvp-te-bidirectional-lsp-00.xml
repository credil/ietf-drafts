	<t> There are several applications that require symmetric 
           Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) path between two points.
           This cannot be achieved with regular MPLS as the LSPs are 
           unidirectional. If symmetry is required, a separate LSP
           in each direction is required for bidirectional traffic flow.
           Generalized MPLS on the other hand, has provisions for
           setting up a bidirectional LSP. This document uses the extensions
           introduced for GMPLS and applies it to regular MPLS for establishing
           bidirectional LSPs.  Additionally, it also describes how bi-directional symmetrical
		Fast Reroute using both one-to-one and facility backup can be achieved.

    <section title="Introduction">
	<t>There are several applications that require symmetrical paths
          between a pair of speakers. One such application is 1588
          <xref target="IEEE-1588"></xref> which requires that the 
         Delay_Resp message takes the same path as the associated
         Delay_Req message. <xref target="I-D.ietf-tictoc-1588overmpls"></xref> 
         describes a method for transporting PTP messages (PDUs) over an MPLS
         network to enable proper handling of these packets. Currently, the only way
         to ensure that the different PTP messages follow a symmetrical path is by 
         statically configuring the RSVP-TE LSPs. This is unscalable and will not work
         in case of network failures as MPLS FRR may not guarantee symmetrical alternate 
         paths.   
   </t> 
	<t> This document describes how RSVP-TE can be used for setting up bi-directional 
           LSPs for regular MPLS and the extensions required in FRR to ensure that the 
           alternate paths are also symmetrical.
	</t>

    </section>

    <section title="RSVP-TE to signal Bi-directional LSP">
     
      <t> <xref target="RFC3473" /> describes a point-to-point bidirectional LSP 
             mechanism for the GMPLS architecture, where a bidirectional LSP setup
             is indicated by the presence of an Upstream Label in the Path message. 
            The Upstream_Label object has the same format as the generalized label, 
            and uses Class-Number 35 (of form 0bbbbbbb) and the C-Type of the label 
            being used. </t>
 
    	<t> For regular MPLS the Upstream_Label object will be used with C-Type value 
			   of 1.
		</t>
		<t> Typically, a node initiates an RSVP session by adding the RRO to the
   				Path message.  The initial RRO contains only one subobject - the
   				sender's IP addresses.  If the node also desires label recording, it
   				sets the Label_Recording flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object. 
 				This document extends this mechanism by also adding the Upstream
 				label that has been advertised in the RRO subobject. Thus the initial RRO
				will now contain the sender's IP address and the Upstream label advertised
				by it.
		</t>		
	</section>

	<section anchor="FRR" title="Fast Reroute mechanisms">
 	 <t> <xref target="RFC4090" /> extensions can be used to perform fast reroute for the
   mechanism described in this document when applied within packet
   networks. This section only applies to LSRs that support <xref target="RFC4090" />.</t>

	<t> This section uses terminology defined in <xref target="RFC4090" />,  and fast reroute
   			procedures defined in <xref target="RFC4090" /> MUST be followed unless specified
 		  below.  The head-end and transit LSRs MUST follow the
		 SESSION_ATTRIBUTE and FAST_REROUTE object processing as specified in
		<xref target="RFC4090" /> for each Path message.
	</t> 

   <t> Since its a bi-directional LSP the detour LSPs and the bypass tunnels that are used
		for the protected LSP must also be bi-directional. This is required so that
       path symmetry is maintained even in an event of a network failure.</t>

	<t> It should be noted that in case of bi-directional LSPs, the LSRs involved will
			play the role of both the Point-of-Local-Repair (PLR) and Merge Point (MP) 
			at the same time during the failure. The router that is the PLR will become 
            the MP for the traffic thats coming from the opposite direction.  
	</t>

	<t>  In the Figure 1 assume that ABCD is the protected LSP. For protecting link BC, 
			there is a bidirectional bypass tunnel BEFC (or a detour LSP in case of 1-on-1). 
			B is the PLR and C is the MP for the traffic flowing from A towards D and 
			B is the MP, and C the PLR for traffic flowing in the opposite direction 
		    (from D towards A).

	</t>

<t>  In the Figure 2 ABCDE is the protected LSP and BFGD is the bypass tunnel 
		for protecting the node C. In this case B is the PLR and D the MP for traffic
		 from A towards E, and the roles reverse, i.e. B becomes the MP and D
		 the PLR for traffic flowing in the opposite direction 
		    (from E towards A).

	</t>


	<section anchor="Upstream" title="Discovering Upstream Labels">
	<t> To support facility backup, the PLR must determine a label that will
   indicate to the MP that packets received with that label should be
   switched along the protected LSP.  This can be done without
   explicitly signaling the backup path if the MP uses a label space
   global to that LSR.
	</t>
	
	<t> As described in <xref target="RFC4090" />, the head-end LSR MUST set the "label
	   recording requested" flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object for LSPs
	   requesting local protection.  This will cause (as specified in
	   <xref target="RFC3209" />) all LSRs to record their INBOUND labels and to note via a
	   flag whether the label is global to the LSR.  Thus, when a protected
	   LSP is first signaled through a PLR, the PLR can examine the RRO in
	   the Resv message and learn about the incoming labels that are used by
	   all downstream nodes for this LSP. Similarly the MP, which will become 
	   the PLR for the reverse direction will learn about the upstream labels
      that are being used by the upstream nodes for this LSP 
       by examining the RRO in the Path message.  
	</t>

	<t> The bypass tunnels and the detour tunnels that are set up for a
           bidirectional LSP must be bidirectional as well. They can internally
           use the Upstream_label technique that was described earlier to 
           establish a bidirectional LSP.
	</t>
	</section>
    </section>

	<section anchor="elements" title="Behavior of various network elements in FRR">
	<t>	When a failure happens in the network the PLR router
            closest to the failure must perform the traffic protection. The
            MP router is the router that is the next hop to the failure point
            and merges the protected traffic back to the original path. In case 
            of bidirectional LSPs, the same LSR is PLR in one direction and the MP
            for the other.  Let us examine in detail what each network element does
            for the MPLS FRR.
	</t>

	<section anchor="HE" title="The Head-End Router Behavior">
	<t>	The Head-End router originates the bi-directional LSP that needs 
			to be protected. Its here that the desired protection type (one-to-one 
			or facility backup) is also defined.
	</t>

	<t>	The Path message which has the FRR information in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE
			object is propagated from the head-end LSR to the Tail router. Each hop sees the
  			FRR flags and assumes the PLR role and tries to establish a bi-directional 
			tunnel. Every hop reports the availability of the FRR protection if its able
			to establish a bi-directional tunnel successfully. This is done via setting the
            RRO flags in the Resv message.
	</t>

	<t>	When a network failure occurs the PLR, or router upstream of the failure to
			be precise, uses FRR to reroute the traffic around the failure, and notifies the 
			head-end LSR by (i) setting the FRR "Local protection in use" flag (0x2) in the RRO
			object of the Resv message and (ii) by sending a PathErr message with an 
			ERROR object with code 0x19 - RSVP Notify Error and error value 0x3 - Tunnel
			locally repaired.

			The router that is downstream of the failure (traditionally the MP in case
			of unidirectional LSPs) also uses FRR to reroute the traffic around the failure.
			It does not send any message to the head-end LSR.		
	</t>

	<t>	The head-end LSR upon recieving this indication tries to switch the traffic to a
			secondary LSP if its available. In case its not active, the head-end LSR signals
			this LSP via make-before-break mechanism.
	</t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="PLR" title="The Point of Local Repair (PLR) Behavior">

	<t> The PLR router of the protected LSP is also the origination point (head-end Router) 
			of the protection tunnel (detour LSP or bypass tunnel).  It is also the MP for the 
			reverse protection tunnel at the same time. When an intermediate LSR receives a 
			Path message carrying a SESSION_ATTRIBUTE with the FRR flags set, it assumes the
			role of a PLR and starts signaling a bi-directional FRR protection tunnel. In case facility 
			backup is requested by the head-end LSR, the PLR signals a new bi-directional tunnel
			only if a bypass tunnel fulfilling the requirements does not already exist.
	</t>

	<t> In the sections that follow the terms upstream and downstream are 
			used in reference to the direction of traffic flow from the head-end towards the 
			tail end. Thus router the tail router is downstream to the head-end.
	</t>

	<t> When a network failure happens, the upstream router local to the failure assumes the 
			role of the PLR and switches the traffic to the protection tunnel. This PLR is from now
			on referred to as the "upstream PLR". The downstream router, local to the failure also 
			assumes the role of the PLR and switches the traffic to the bidirectional protection
			 tunnel that is set up. This PLR is referred to as the "downstream PLR".
			These routers can use either the bi-directional detour LSP or a bi-directional bypass
			 tunnel, depending upon what	was requested by the head-end LSR. 
	</t>

	<t> The egress label that each PLR uses depends upon the kind of protection provided.
			The behavior of the "upstream PLR" remains unchanged for both
			one-to-one backup and facility backup protection mechanisms as described in 
            <xref target="RFC4090" />. The subsequent sections thus only explain
		  the behavior of the  "downstream PLR"  during these two protection modes.
	</t>

	<t> Once the traffic gets switched to the protection path, the "downstream" PLR
			does not need to inform the HE router about the network failure.
	</t>

<section title="PLR Behavior during one-to-one backup for a node failure">
	<t>In case of
			one-to-one backup, the protection or the detour tunnel is a regular LSP. The 
			downstream PLR uses the label that was distributed by the immediate 
			upstream router on the detour LSP (detour label) to detour traffic arriving from the downstream 
			router of the protected LSP. The label arriving from the immediate downstream router
			of the protected tunnel is swapped with the detour label, and the traffic is sent through the
			detour LSP.

	<t> The above figure describes this mechanism. udL1 is the Upstream_label advertised

            udL2 is the Upstream_label advertised by F to D, when setting up this LSP.
			uL1, uL2, uL3 and uL4 are the Upstream_labels advertised when setting
			up the bi-directional protected tunnel ABCDE.
	</t>

	<t> When a network failure happens, in this case the LSR router 
			between B and D fails, the node D will assume the role of a downstream PLR and would 
			need to switch the traffic from the protected LSP to the detour LSP. 
			D does this by programming a Swap operation on the egress of the
			protected LSP path to the egress of the detour LSP.  The uL4 label is 
			thus swapped with udL2 during the failure, instead of label uL3.
	</t>
	</section>

	<section title="PLR Behavior during facility backup for a node failure">
	<t> In the case of facility backup, the data from the protected LSP 
			is tunneled through the bypass tunnel. Therefore, the outer label 
			of the tunneled packet in the reverse direction is the label distributed 
			by the immediate upstream router of the bypass tunnel. The "downstream PLR"
		 also needs to know what label was expected by the router where this tunneled 
		traffic merges (MP) at the upstream. The record label option makes this information 
		available from the RRO in the Path messages for the protected LSP. 
		This is the inner label that must be 
		in the tunneled packet. Thus, the "downstream PLR" swaps the incoming label
		 from the immediate downstream router in the protected path with these two labels 
		and sends the path through the bypass tunnel.

			uL1, uL2, uL3 and uL4 are the Upstream_labels advertised when setting
			up the bi-directional protected tunnel ABCDE.
	</t>

	<t> The "downstream" PLR router (D in this case) knows the 
			label (uL2 in this case) that the upstream NNHop 
			router expects because it has received a Path message which had this 
			Upstream_label recorded in the RRO.
	</t>

	<t> When a network failure happens, in this case the LSR router between B
   and D fails, the node D will assume the role of a "downstream" PLR and reroutes
		the traffic from the protected LSP through the bypass tunnel as follows:
	<list style="symbols">

	<t> PLR D performs a swap operation to change the transport label. Since it
		knows that its doing node protection over the bypass tunnel, it will use the
		label that the NNHop router ("upstream" MP) expects instead of the
		label that the Nhop router (failed LSR) expects.  D thus, swaps out 
		uL4	and replaces it with uL2, instead of uL3 as it would normally have done.
	</t>

	<t> D also pushes the label udL2 on top of the label stack. This label would
			be used to switch the packet on the bypass tunnel and would finally 
			reach the MP, which happens to be B in our case.

			protection tunnel's state by sending the Resv messages to the PLR and
			is also responsible for maintaining the state of the protected tunnel during 
			the network failure. The upstream MP, defined in this document, is not
			required to do any of these. Its only responsible for merging the reverse traffic 
			back to the protected path.
	</t>
