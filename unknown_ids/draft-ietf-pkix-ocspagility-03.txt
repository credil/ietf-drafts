Abstract

   The OSCP specification defined in RFC 2560 requires server responses
   to be signed but does not specify a mechanism for selecting the
   signature algorithm to be used leading to possible interoperability
   failures in contexts where multiple signature algorithms are in use.
   This document specifies an algorithm for server signature algorithm
   selection and an extension that allows a client to advise a server
   that specific signature algorithms are supported.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  OCSP Algorithm Agility Requirements

   OCSP RFC 2560 [RFC2560] defines a protocol for obtaining certificate
   status information from an online service. An OCSP Responder may or
   may not be issued an OCSP Responder certificate by the CA that issued
   the certificate whose status is being queried.  An OCSP Responder may
   provide pre-signed OCSP responses or may sign responses when queried.

   RFC 2560 [RFC2560] specifies a means for an OCSP responder to
   indicate the signature and digest algorithms used in a response but
   not how those algorithms are specified.  The only algorithm mandated
   by the protocol specification is that the OCSP client SHALL support
   the DSA sig-alg-oid specified in section 7.2.2 of [RFC2459] and
   SHOULD be capable of processing RSA signatures as specified in
   section 7.2.1 of [RFC2459].  The only requirement placed on
   responders is that they SHALL support the SHA1 hashing algorithm.

   This requirement is clearly insufficient to ensure interoperability.

   While an OCSP Responder may apply rules such as using the signature
   algorithm employed by the CA for signing CRLs and certificates, such
   rules may fail in common situations such as:

   o  Algorithm used to sign the CRLs and certificates  may not be
      consistent with key pair being used by the OCSP Responder to sign
      responses.

   o  A responder cannot draw any conclusions from a request for an
      unknown certificate.

   The last criterion cannot be resolved through the information
   available from in-band signaling using the RFC 2560 [RFC2560]
   protocol without modification.

   In addition, an OCSP Responder may wish to employ different signature
   algorithms than the the one used by the CA to sign certificates and
   CRLs for several reasons:

   o  The responder may intentionally employ an algorithm for
      certificate status response that is less computationally demanding
      than for signing the certificate itself.

   o  An implementation may intentionally wish to guard against the
      possibility of a compromise resulting from a signature algorithm
      compromise by employing two separate signature algorithms.


   This document describes:

   o  A mechanism that allows a client to indicate the set of preferred
      signature algorithms.

   o  An algorithm for signature algorithm selection that maximizes the
      probability of successful operation in the case that no supported
      preferred algorithm(s) are specified.


3.  Client Indication of Preferred Signature Algorithms

   A client MAY declare a preferred set of algorithms in a request by
   including a preferred signature algorithms extension in
   requestExtensions of the OCSPRequest [RFC2560].


      id-pkix-ocsp-preferred-signature-algorithms OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
            { id-pkix-ocsp x }

      PreferredSignatureAlgorithms ::= SEQUENCE OF
                                       PreferredSignatureAlgorithm

      PreferredSignatureAlgorithm ::= SEQUENCE {
         sigIdentifier   AlgorithmIdentifier,
         certIdentifier  AlgorithmIdentifier OPTIONAL
         }

   The syntax of AlgorithmIdentifier is defined in section 4.1.1.2 of
   RFC 5280 [RFC5280]

   sigIdentifier specifies the signature algorithm the client prefers.
   e.g., algorithm=ecdsa-with-sha256 and parameters are absent.

   certIdentifier specifies the subject public key algorithm identifier
   the client prefers in the server's certificate used to validate the
   OCSP response. e.g. algorithm=id-ecPublicKey and parameters=
   secp256r1.

   certtIdentifier is OPTIONAL and provides means to specify parameters
   necessary to distinguish among different usages of a particular
   algorithm, e.g. it may be used by the client to specify what curve it
   supports for a given elliptic curve algorithm.

   The client MUST support each of the specified preferred signature
   algorithms and the client MUST specify the algorithms in the order of
   preference.

   The server SHOULD use one of the preferred signature algorithms for
   signing OCSP responses to the requesting client.

4.  Responder Signature Algorithm Selection

   RFC 2560 [RFC2560] does not specify a mechanism for deciding the
   signature algorithm to be used in an OCSP response.  As previously
   noted this does not provide a sufficient degree of certainty as to
   the algorithm selected to guarantee interoperability.

4.1.  Dynamic Response

   A responder MAY maximize the potential for ensuring interoperability
   by selecting a supported signature algorithm using the following
   order of precedence, as long as the selected algorithm meets all
   security requirements of the OCSP responder, where the first method
   has the highest precedence:

   1.  Using an algorithm specified as a preferred signing algorithm in
       the client request

   2.  Using the signing algorithm used to sign a CRL issued by the
       certificate issuer providing status information for the
       certificate specified by CertID

   3.  Using the signing algorithm used to sign the OCSPRequest

   4.  Using a signature algorithm that has been advertised as being the
       default signature algorithm for the signing service using an out
       of band mechanism

   5.  Using a mandatory or recommended signing algorithm specified for
       the version of the OCSP protocol in use

   A responder SHOULD always apply the lowest numbered selection
   mechanism that is known, supported and meets the responder's criteria
   for cryptographic algorithm strength.

4.2.  Static Response

   For purposes of efficiency, an OCSP responder is permitted to
   generate static responses in advance of a request.  Although this
   case does not permit the responder to make use of the client data
   directly, the responder may anticipate the client request and
   generate a set of signed responses so as to maximize the probability
   that it is possible to generate a response that is assigned the
   highest preference weighting following the selection logic in 4.1.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no actions by IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   The mechanism used to choose the response signing algorithm MUST be
   considered to be sufficiently secure against cryptanalytic attack for
   the intended application.

   In most applications it is sufficient for the signing algorithm to be
   at least as secure as the signing algorithm used to sign the original
   certificate whose status is being queried.  This criteria may not
   hold in long term archival applications however in which the status
   of a certificate is being queried for a date in the distant past,
   long after the signing algorithm has ceased being considered
   trustworthy.

7.1.  Use of insecure algorithms

   It is not always possible for a responder to generate a response that
   the client is expected to understand and meets contemporary standards
   for cryptographic security.  In such cases an application MUST
   balance the risk of employing a compromised security solution and the
   cost of mandating an upgrade, including the risk that the alternative
   chosen by end users will offer even less security or no security.

   In archival applications it is quite possible that an OCSP responder
   might be asked to report the validity of a certificate on a date in
   the distant past.  Such a certificate might employ a signing method
   that is no longer considered acceptably secure.  In such
   circumstances the responder MUST NOT generate a signature for a
   signing mechanism that is considered unacceptably insecure.

   A client MUST accept any signing algorithm in a response that it
   specified as a preferred signing algorithm in the request.  It
   follows therefore that a client MUST NOT specify as a preferred
   signing algorithm any signing algorithm that is either not supported
   or not considered acceptably secure.

7.2.  Man in the Middle Downgrade Attack

   The mechanism to support client indication of preferred signature
   algorithms is not protected against a man in the middle downgrade
   attack.  This constraint is not considered to be a significant
   security concern since the OCSP Responder MUST NOT sign OCSP
   Responses using weak algorithms even if requested by the client.  In
   addition, the client can reject OCSP responses that do not meet its
   own criteria for acceptable cryptographic security no matter what
   mechanism is used to determine the signing algorithm of the response.
