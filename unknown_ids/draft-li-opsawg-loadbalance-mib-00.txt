Internet-Draft             MIB for loadbalance                 July 2011


1.  Introduction

   Load Balance device is a performance optimization equipment.  The
   trouble associated with the improvement of traffic volume and the
   rapid growth of data flow can be solved by Load Balance(LB).There are
   increasing requirements to implement LB in network.  This document
   defines 4 MIB Modules which together support the configuration and
   monitoring of Load Balance device.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410[RFC3410] .  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual
   information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the
   mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2,
   which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578[RFC2578], STD 58, RFC
   2579[RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580[RFC2580]


3.  Overview of Load-Balance MIB objects

   The following subsections describe the purpose of each of the objects
   contained in the loadbalance-MIB.

   3.1.  Loadbalance System Entity Table

   The LBSysEntityTable specificed in [RFC1907] and [RFC2233] is used to
   inquire and modify configuration management information.

   Each entry row in this table represents a single loadbalance entity.
   The operator should inquire or modify system/interface/routing
   protocol parameters by the table.

   3.2.  Loadbalance config Table

   Since loadbalance device provides traffic dispatch ,health detection
   and session persistence function, it is neccessory to monitor
   loadbalance parameters such as disptach method , health detection
   method and session persistence policy.

   The LBConfigTable is a read and write table.  Each entry in this
   table represents the LB working parameter.

   3.3.  Loadbalance Alarm Table

   Loadbalance device should report the alarm to operating system in
   real-time when fault happens.  The fault can be divided into general
   alarm and specific alarm.  The general alarm contains system alarm,
   link alarm and authentication failed alarm. while, the specific alarm
   contains network protocol alarm, for example OSPF or ISIS.

   3.4.  Loadbalance Performance Table

   LBPerfTable is a read-only table which contains statistical
   information related to L3(IP layer) interface performance parameter,
   L3 network protocol parameter , L4/L7(transport layer or application
   layer) current active connections.
