    <section anchor="ua-behavior" title="User Agent Behavior">
      <t>Whenever a user agent issues an HTTP request, the user agent MUST
      include exactly one HTTP header named "Origin" that conforms to the
      following ABNF [RFC5234] grammar:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
  origin              = "origin" ":" origin-list-or-null
  origin-list-or-null = OWS [ "null" / origin-list ] OWS
  origin-list         = serialized-origin *( SP serialized-origin )
  serialized-origin   = scheme "://" host [ ":" port ]
   ; &lt;scheme&gt;, &lt;host&gt;, &lt;port&gt; productions from RFC3986
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      </t>

      <t>Whenever a user agent would send a Origin header containing two
      consecutive, identical origin serializations, the user agent MUST remove
      one such origin serialization from the header.</t>

      <t>Whenever a user agent issues an HTTP request from a
      "privacy-sensitive" context, the user agent MUST send the value "null"
      in the Origin header.</t>

      <t>If /B/ is the Request-URI in the Request-Line of an HTTP request, then
      the associated HTTP response is an "HTTP redirect from URI /B/" if the
      response contains a 3xx Status Code (all terms RFC2616).</t>

      <t>Whenever a user agent issues an HTTP request to URI /A/ as a result of
      an HTTP redirect from URI /B/, the user agent MUST either:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>set the value of the Origin header in the HTTP request to /A/
        to "null" (i.e., the code point sequence U+006E, U+0075, U+006C,
        U+006C),</t>

        <t>set the value of the Origin header in the /A/ request to the value
        of the Origin header in the /B/ request extended with a space and the
        ASCII serialization of the origin of /B/, unless this would result in
        the header containing the origin serialization "null" in a
        component.</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>Whenever a user agent issues an HTTP request that (1) is *not* the
      result of an HTTP redirect and (2) is *not* initiated from a
      "privacy-sensitive" context, the user agent SHOULD set the value of the
      Origin header to the ASCII serialization of the origin that
      initiated the HTTP request.</t>

      <t>Note: This behavior differs from that of the HTTP Referer header,
      which user agents often suppress when an origin with an "https" scheme
      issues a request for a URI with an "http" scheme.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="server-behavior" title="HTTP Server Behavior">
      <t>HTTP Servers MAY use the Origin header to "defend themselves
      against CSRF attacks."  Such servers are known as "participating
      servers" in this section.</t>

      <t>Let the /origin white list/ of a participating server be a set of
      strings selected by the operator of that server.</t>

      <t>The string "null" MUST NOT be a member of the /origin white list/
      for any participating server.
      <list style="empty">
        <t>Example: The origin white list for the example.com Web server
        could be the strings "http://example.com", "https://example.com",
        "http://www.example.com", and "https://www.example.com".</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>A participating server MUST use the following algorithm when
      determining whether to modify state in response to an HTTP request:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>If the request method is safe (as defined by RFC 2616,
        Section 9.1.1, e.g. either "GET" nor "HEAD"), return "MUST NOT
        modify state" and abort these steps.</t>

        <t>If the request does not contain a header named "Origin", return
        "MAY modify state" abort these steps.</t>

        <t>For each request header named "Origin", let the /initiating
        origin list/ be the list of origins represented in the header:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>If there exists a origin in the /initiating origin list/ is not
          a member of the /origin white list/ for this server, return "MUST
          NOT modify state" and abort these steps.</t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>Return "MAY modify state".</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>
      <list style="empty">
        <t>Example: A Web server could modify state in response to POST
        requests that lack an Origin header (because these requests are sent
        by non-supporting user agents) and could modify state in response to
        POST requests that have an Origin header of "http://example.com",
        "https://example.com", "http://www.example.com", or
        "https://www.example.com".</t>

    <section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>This section is not normative.</t>

      <t>The Origin header improves on the Referer header by respecting the
      user's privacy: The Origin header includes only the information
      required to identify the principal that initiated the request
      (typically the scheme, host, and port of initiating origin).  In
      particular, the Origin header does not contain the path or query
      portions of the URI included in the Referer header that invade privacy
      without providing additional security.</t>

      <t>The Origin header also improves on the Referer header by not
      leaking intranet host names to external web sites when a user follows
      a hyperlink from an intranet host to an external site because
      hyperlinks generate privacy-sensitive requests.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This section is not normative.</t>

      <t>Because a supporting user agent will always include the Origin
      header when making HTTP requests, HTTP servers can detect that a
      request was initiated by a supporting user agent by observing the
      presence of the header.  This design prevents a malicious web site from
      making a supporting user agent appear to be a non-supporting user agent.
      Unlike the Referer header, which is absent when suppressed by the user
      agent, the Origin header takes on the value "null" when suppressed by
      the user agent.</t>

      <t>In some legacy user agents, The Origin header can be spoofed for
      same-site XMLHttpRequests.  Sites that rely only on network
      connectivity for authentication should use a DNS rebinding defense,
      such as validating the HTTP Host header, in addition to CSRF
      protection.</t>
