                Transmission of Syslog Messages over TCP
                 draft-gerhards-syslog-plain-tcp-13.txt

Abstract

   There have been many implementations and deployments of legacy syslog
   over TCP for many years.  That protocol has evolved without being
   standardized and has proven to be quite interoperable in practice.
   This memo describes how TCP has been used as a transport for syslog
   messages.

Internet-Draft  Transmission of Syslog Messages over TCP    January 2012


1.  Introduction

   The standards track documents in the syslog series recommend using
   the syslog protocol [RFC5424] with the TLS transport [RFC5425] for
   all event messages.  The authors of this document wholeheartedly
   support that position and only offer this document to describe what
   has been observed with legacy syslog over TCP, which appears to still
   be widely used.  It is hoped that this description will promote
   future interoperability.

   Two primary format options have been observed with legacy syslog
   being transported over TCP.  These have been called non-transparent-
   framing and octet-counting.  The non-transparent-framing mechanism
   has some inherent problems.

   Diagram 1 shows how all of these syslog transports relate to each
   other.  In this diagram three originators are seen, labeled A, B, and
   C, along with one collector.  Originator A is using the TCP transport
   which is described in this document.  Originator B is using the UDP
   transport, which is described in [RFC5426].  Originator C is using
   the TLS transport, which is described in [RFC5425].  The collector is
   shown with the capability to accept all three transports.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The terminology defined in Section 3 of [RFC5424] is used throughout
   this specification.  The reader should be familiar with that to
   follow this discussion.

   This document also references devices that use the syslog message
   format as described in [RFC3164].  Devices that continue to use that
   message format (regardless of transport) will be described as "legacy
   syslog devices".  Similarly, devices that use the message format as
   described in [RFC5424] will be described as "standardized syslog
   devices".


3.  Message Transmission

   Syslog is simplex in nature.  It has been observed that
   implementations of syslog over TCP also do not use any backchannel
   mechanism to convey information to the transport sender, and
   consequently do not use any application-level acknowledgement for
   syslog receiver to sender signaling.  Message receipt
   acknowledgement, reliability, and flow control are provided by the
   capabilities of TCP.

3.1.  Character Encoding Scheme

   Syslog over TCP messages contain no indication of the coded character
   set (e.g., [US-ASCII] or [UNICODE] ) or character encoding scheme
   (e.g., so-called "7-bit ASCII" or UTF-8 [RFC3629]) in use.  In these
   messages, the predominant approach has been to include characters
   only from the ASCII repertoire (i.e., %d32 to %d126 inclusive) using
   the "Network Virtual Terminal" (NVT) encoding [RFC5198].

   The message header usually contains characters only from the ASCII
   repertoire, in the NVT encoding.  This has been observed even in
   cases where a different encoding (e.g., UTF-8) has been used for the
   MSG part.  However, characters outside the ASCII range have been seen
   inside the header.  In that case, some syslog applications have been
   known to experience problems processing those messages.

   In some cases, it has been observed that characters outside of the
   ASCII range are often being transformed by receivers in an effort to
   "escape control characters".  Some receiver implementations simply
   drop those characters.  This is considered to be a poor practice as
   it causes problems with coded character sets other than ASCII and
   character encodings other than NVT, most notably the UTF-8 encoding
   of Unicode.




Gerhards & Lonvick        Expires July 4, 2012                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  Transmission of Syslog Messages over TCP    January 2012


   It has also been observed that relays will forward messages using the
   character encoding schemes of messages they receive.  In the case
   where two different senders are using different character encoding
   schemes, the relay will forward each message to a collector in that
   character encoding.  The collector of these messages will have to be
   prepared to receive messages from the same relay with different
   encodings.

3.2.  Session

   Like most other protocols, the syslog transport sender is the TCP
   host that initiates the TCP session.  After initiation, messages are
   sent from the transport sender to the transport receiver.  No
   application-level data is transmitted from the transport receiver to
   the transport sender.  The roles of transport sender and receiver
   seem to be fixed once the session is established.

   When it has been observed, if an error occurs that cannot be
   corrected by TCP, the host detecting the error gracefully closes the
   TCP session.  There have been no application level messages seen that
   were sent to notify the other host about the state of the host syslog
   application.

3.3.  Session Initiation

   The TCP host acting as a syslog transport receiver listens to a TCP
   port.  The TCP transport sender initiates a TCP session to the syslog
   transport receiver as specified in [RFC0793].

   This protocol has no standardized port assignment.  In practice,
   network administrators generally choose something that they feel will
   not conflict with anything else active in their networks.  This has
   most often been either TCP/514, which is actually allocated to
   another protocol, or some variant of adding 514 to a multiple of
   1000.  Please see Section 4 for more information about this.

3.4.  Message Transfer

   Syslog over TCP has been around for a number of years.  Just like
   legacy syslog over UDP, different implementations exist.  The older
   method of non-transparent-framing has problems.  The newer method of
   octet-counting is reliable and has not been seen to cause problems
   noted with the non-transparent-framing method.

   In both of these methods, during the message transfer phase, the
   syslog transport sender sends a stream of messages to the transport
   receiver.  These are sent in sequence and one message is encapsulated
   inside each TCP frame.  Either of the TCP hosts may initiate session



Gerhards & Lonvick        Expires July 4, 2012                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  Transmission of Syslog Messages over TCP    January 2012


   closure at any time as specified in Section 3.5 of [RFC0793].  In
   practice, this is often seen after a prolonged period of inactivity.

3.4.1.  Octet Counting

   This framing allows for the transmission of all characters inside a
   syslog message and is similar to the method used in [RFC5425].  A
   transport receiver uses the defined message length to delimit a
   syslog message.  As noted in [RFC3164] the upper limit for a legacy
   syslog message length is 1024 octets.  That length has been expanded
   for standardized syslog.

   It can be assumed that octet-counting framing is used if a syslog
   frame starts with a digit.

   All syslog messages can be considered to be TCP "data" as per
   Transmission Control Protocol [RFC0793].  The syslog message stream
   has the following ABNF [RFC5234] definition:

       TCP-DATA = *SYSLOG-FRAME

       SYSLOG-FRAME = MSG-LEN SP SYSLOG-MSG   ; Octet-counting
                                              ; method

       MSG-LEN = NONZERO-DIGIT *DIGIT

       NONZERO-DIGIT = %d49-57

       SYSLOG-MSG is defined in the syslog protocol [RFC5424] and may
                  also be considered to be the payload in [RFC3164]


   MSG-LEN is the octet count of the SYSLOG-MSG in the SYSLOG-FRAME.

3.4.2.  Non-Transparent-Framing

   The non-transparent-framing method inserts a syslog message into a
   frame and terminates it with a TRAILER character.  The TRAILER has
   usually been a single character and most often is ASCII LF (%d10).
   However, other characters have also been seen, with ASCII NUL (%d00)
   being a prominent example.  Some devices have also been seen to emit
   a two-character TRAILER, which is usually CR and LF.

   The problem with non-transparent-framing comes from the use of a
   TRAILER character.  In that, the traditional trailer character is not
   escaped within the message, which causes problems for the receiver.
   For example, a message in the style of [RFC3164] containing one or
   more LF characters may be misinterpreted as multiple messages by the



Gerhards & Lonvick        Expires July 4, 2012                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  Transmission of Syslog Messages over TCP    January 2012


   receiving syslog application.

   The ABNF for this is shown here:

       TCP-DATA = *SYSLOG-FRAME

       SYSLOG-FRAME = SYSLOG-MSG TRAILER  ; non-transparent-framing
                                          ; method

       TRAILER = LF / APP-DEFINED

       APP-DEFINED = 1*2OCTET

       SYSLOG-MSG is defined in the syslog protocol [RFC5424] and may
                  also be considered to be the payload in [RFC3164]


   A transport receiver can assume that non-transparent-framing is used
   if a syslog frame starts with the ASCII character "<" (%d60).

3.4.3.  Method Change

   It has been observed in legacy implementations that the framing may
   change on a frame-by-frame basis.  This is probably not a good idea,
   but it's been seen.

3.5.  Session Closure

   The syslog session is closed when one of the TCP hosts decides to do
   so.  It then initiates a local TCP session closure.  Following TCP
   [RFC0793] it doesn't need to notify the remote TCP host of its
   intention to close the session, nor does it accept any messages that
   are still in transit.


4.  Applicability Statement

   Again it must be emphasized that the standards track documents in the
   syslog series recommend using the TLS transport [RFC5425] to
   transport syslog messages.  This document does not recommend that new
   implementations or deployments use syslog over TCP except for the
   explicit purpose of interoperating with existing deployments.

   One of the major problems with interoperability with this protocol is
   that there is no consistent TCP port assigned.  Most of the
   successful implementations have made the selection of a port a user-
   configurable option.  The most frequently observed port for this has
   been TCP/514.  While this port is actually assigned to the Shell



Gerhards & Lonvick        Expires July 4, 2012                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  Transmission of Syslog Messages over TCP    January 2012


   protocol, it does not seem to cause any problems in actual use.  This
   may be because the Shell protocol is not in use in the Internet
   because the services that use it have been disabled in most, if not
   all, devices.

   There are several advantages to using TCP: flow control, error
   recovery, and reliability, to name a few.  These reasons and the ease
   of programming have lead people to use this transmission protocol to
   transmit syslog.

   One potential disadvantage is the buffering mechanism used by TCP.
   Ordinarily, TCP decides when enough data has been received from the
   application to form a segment for transmission.  This may be adjusted
   through timers but still, some application data may wait in a buffer
   for a relatively long time.  Syslog data is not normally time-
   sensitive but if this delay is a concern, the syslog transport sender
   may utilize the PUSH Flag as described in [RFC0793] to have the
   sending TCP immediately send all buffered data.


5.  Security Considerations

   This protocol makes no meaningful provisions for security.  It lacks
   authentication, integrity checking, and privacy.  It makes no
   provision for flow control or end-to-end confirmation of receipt,
   relying instead on the underlying TCP implementations to approximate
   these functions.  It should not be used if deployment of [RFC5425] on
   the systems in question is feasible.


6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no requests for IANA actions in this document.

8.  Notes to the RFC Editor and Change Log

   These are notes to the RFC editor.  Please delete this section after
   the notes have been followed.

   Version -13 addresses the IESG reviews and is changed to Historic.
   It was submitted in January of 2012.

   Version -12 addresses AD Review comments as well as GENART comments.
   It was submitted in December of 2011.

   Version -11 fixed the ABNF and was submitted in October of 2011.

   Version -10 was put together based on Randy Presuhn's feedback as
   shepherd.  A section on character sets has been added.  The term
   "octet-stuffing" was incorrectly used and has been replaced by "non-
   transparent-framing".  The security considerations section has been
   simplified.  It was submitted in October of 2011.

   Version -09 was put together based on IESG member feedback.  The
   appendixes were removed and things were consolidated to be more
   appropriate for an informational document.  It was submitted in
   August of 2011.  Dan Romascanu is actually the IESG member who will
   watch this document.

   Version -08 included a reference to vulnerabilities of TCP.  It was
   submitted in February of 2011.

   Version -07 was submitted in January, 2011.  This clarified what was
   really expected from what was optional.  Appendix B was added for
   further clarification.  Additionally, the security Considerations
   section was edited to include a discussion about transport layer
   issues.

   Version -06 was submitted in October, 2010.  The 2119 language was
   removed.  Also, we compared notes and couldn't find any
   implementations that stacked multiple messages in a frame in the
   octet-counting method.  That paragraph was removed.

   Version -05 was submitted in September, 2010 to address some items
   that David Harrington noted as he is becoming the document shepherd.

   Version -04 was submitted in April, 2010 to clean up some items.

   Version -03 was submitted in April, 2010 based upon further review
   comments from Tom Petch.

   Version -02 was submitted in March, 2010 based upon review comments
