		<abstract>
			<t>This document defines two URI schemes and the resolution mechanism to generate a list of server transport addresses that can be tried to create a Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) allocation.</t>
		</abstract>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>
				The <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn">TURN specification</xref> defines a process for a TURN client to find TURN servers by using DNS SRV resource records, but this process does not let the TURN server administrators provision the preferred TURN transport protocol between the client and the server and for the TURN client to discover this preference.
				This document defines an <xref target="RFC3958">S-NAPTR application</xref> for this purpose.
				This application defines "RELAY" as an application service tag and "turn.udp", "turn.tcp", and "turn.tls" as application protocol tags.
			</t>
			<t>To simplify the provisioning of TURN clients, this document also defines a TURN and a TURNS URI scheme and a resolution mechanism to convert these URIs into a list of IP addresses, ports and TURN transport protocols.</t>

			<t>
				Another usage of the resolution mechanism described in this document would be Remote Hosting as described in <xref target="RFC3958"/> section 4.4.
				For example a VoIP provider who does not want to deploy TURN servers could use the servers deployed by another company but could still want to provide configuration parameters to its customers without explicitly showing this relationship.
				The mechanism permits one to implement this indirection, without preventing the company hosting the TURN servers from managing them as it see fit.

			<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="syntax" title="Syntax of a TURN or TURNS URI">
			<t>A TURN/TURNS URI has the following ABNF syntax <xref target="RFC5234"/>:</t>

			<figure>
				<artwork type="abnf">
turnURI   = scheme ":" host [ ":" port ] [ "?transport=" transport ]
scheme    = "turn" / "turns"
transport = "udp" / "tcp" / transport-ext
transport-ext = 1*unreserved
				</artwork>
			</figure>

			<t>&lt;host&gt;, &lt;port&gt; and &lt;unreserved&gt; are specified in <xref target="RFC3986"/>.</t>
			<t>Note that the usage of components defined in the <xref target="RFC3986"/> as part of a generic hierarchical URI does not mean that a TURN/TURNS URI is hierarchical.</t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="resolution" title="Resolution Mechanism">
			<t>
				The resolution mechanism is used only to create an allocation.
				All other transactions use the IP address, transport and port used for a successful allocation creation.
			</t>
			<t>
				The resolution algorithm uses &lt;scheme&gt;, &lt;host&gt;, &lt;port&gt; and &lt;transport&gt; from the TURN URI as input.
				It also uses as input a list ordered by preference of TURN transports (UDP, TCP, TLS) supported that is provided by the application using the TURN client.
				This list reflects the capabilities and preferences of the application code as opposed to the TURN URI that reflects the preferences of the user of the application.
				The output of the algorithm is a list of {IP address, transport, port} tuples that a TURN client can try in order to create an allocation on a TURN server.
			</t>
			<t>
				An Allocate error response as specified in section 6.4 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/> is processed as a failure as specified by <xref target="RFC3958"/> section 2.2.4.
				The resolution stops when a TURN client gets a successful Allocate response from a TURN server.
				After an allocation succeeds or all the allocations fail, the resolution context MUST be discarded and the resolution algorithm MUST be restarted from the beginning for any subsequent allocation.
				Servers blacklisted as described in section 6.4 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/> SHOULD NOT be used for the specified duration even if returned by a subsequent resolution.
			</t>
			<t>First the resolution algorithm checks that the URI can be resolved with the list of TURN transports supported by the application:</t>
			<t>
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>If &lt;scheme&gt; is defined as "turn" and &lt;transport&gt; is defined as "udp" but the list of TURN transports supported by the application does not contain UDP then the resolution MUST stop with an error.</t>
					<t>If &lt;scheme&gt; is defined as "turn" and &lt;transport&gt; is defined as "tcp" but the list of TURN transports supported by the application does not contain TCP then the resolution MUST stop with an error.</t>
					<t>If &lt;scheme&gt; is defined as "turns" and &lt;transport&gt; is defined as "udp" then the algorithm MUST stop with an error.</t>
					<t>If &lt;scheme&gt; is defined as "turns" and &lt;transport&gt; is defined as "tcp" but the list of TURN transports supported by the application does not contain TLS then the resolution MUST stop with an error.</t>
					<t>If &lt;scheme&gt; is defined as "turns" and &lt;transport&gt; is not defined but the list of TURN transports supported by the application does not contain TLS then the resolution MUST stop with an error.</t>
					<t>If &lt;transport&gt; is defined but unknown then the resolution MUST stop with an error.</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>
				After verifying the validity of the URI elements, the algorithm filters the list of TURN transports supported by the application by removing the UDP and TCP TURN transport if the &lt;scheme&gt; is defined as "turns".
				If the list of TURN transports is empty after this filtering, the resolution MUST stop with an error.
			</t>
			<t>
				After filtering the list of TURN transports supported by the application, the algorithm applies the steps described below.
				Note that in some steps, &lt;scheme&gt; and &lt;transport&gt; have to be converted to a TURN transport.
				If &lt;scheme&gt; is defined as "turn" and &lt;transport&gt; is defined as "udp" then the TURN UDP transport is used.
				If &lt;scheme&gt; is defined as "turn" and &lt;transport&gt; is defined as "tcp" then the TURN TCP transport is used.
				If &lt;scheme&gt; is defined as "turns" and &lt;transport&gt; is defined as "tcp" then the TURN TLS transport is used.
				This is summarized in <xref target="conversion"/>.

				<list style="numbers">
					<t>
						If &lt;host&gt; is an IP address, then it indicates the specific IP address to be used.
						If &lt;port&gt; is not defined, the default port declared in <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/> for the SRV service name defined in &lt;scheme&gt; is used.
						If &lt;transport&gt; is defined then &lt;scheme&gt; and &lt;transport&gt; are converted to a TURN transport as specified in <xref target="conversion"/>.
						If &lt;transport&gt; is not defined, the filtered TURN transports supported by the application are tried by preference order.
						If the TURN client cannot contact a TURN server with this IP address and port on any of the transports supported by the application then the resolution MUST stop with an error.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t>
						If &lt;host&gt; is a domain name and &lt;port&gt; is defined, then &lt;host&gt; is resolved to a list of IP addresses via DNS A and AAAA queries.
						If &lt;transport&gt; is defined, then &lt;scheme&gt; and &lt;transport&gt; are converted to a TURN transport as specified in <xref target="conversion"/>.
						If &lt;transport&gt; is not defined, the filtered TURN transports supported by the application are tried in preference order.
						The TURN client can choose the order to contact the resolved IP addresses in any implementation-specific way.
						If the TURN client cannot contact a TURN server with this port, the transport or list of transports, and the resolved IP addresses, then the resolution MUST stop with an error.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t>

						If &lt;host&gt; is a domain name and &lt;port&gt; is not defined but &lt;transport&gt; is defined, then the SRV algorithm defined in <xref target="RFC2782"/> is used to generate a list of IP address and port tuples.
						&lt;host&gt; is used as Name, &lt;scheme&gt; as Service and &lt;transport&gt; as Protocol in the SRV algorithm.
						&lt;scheme&gt; and &lt;transport&gt; are converted to a TURN transport as specified in <xref target="conversion"/> and this transport is used with each tuple for contacting the TURN server.
						The SRV algorithm recommends doing an A query if the SRV query returns an error or no SRV RR;
						in this case the default port declared in <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/> for the SRV service name defined in &lt;scheme&gt; MUST be used for contacting the TURN server.
						Also in this case, this specification modifies the SRV algorithm by recommending an A and AAAA query.
						If the TURN client cannot contact a TURN server at any of the IP address and port tuples returned by the SRV algorithm with the transport converted from the &lt;scheme&gt; and &lt;transport&gt; then the resolution MUST stop with an error.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t>
						If &lt;host&gt; is a domain name and &lt;port&gt; and &lt;transport&gt; are not defined, then &lt;host&gt; is converted to an ordered list of IP address, port and transport tuples via the S-NAPTR algorithm defined in <xref target="RFC3958"/> by using &lt;host&gt; as the initial target domain name and "RELAY" as the Application Service Tag.
						The filtered list of TURN transports supported by the application are converted in Application Protocol Tags by using "turn.udp" if the TURN transport is UDP, "turn.tcp" if the TURN transport is TCP and "turn.tls" if the TURN transport is TLS.
						The order to try the Application Protocol Tags is provided by the ranking of the first set of NAPTR records.
						If multiple Application Protocol Tags have the same ranking, the preferred order set by the application is used.
						If the first NAPTR query fails, the processing continues in step 5.
						If the TURN client cannot contact a TURN server with any of the IP address, port and transport tuples returned by the S-NAPTR algorithm then the resolution MUST stop with an error.
						<vspace blankLines="1"/>
					</t>
					<t>
						If the first NAPTR query in the previous step does not return any result then the SRV algorithm defined in <xref target="RFC2782"/> is used to generate a list of IP address and port tuples.
						The SRV algorithm is applied by using each transport in the filtered list of TURN transports supported by the application for the Protocol, &lt;host&gt; for the Name and &lt;scheme&gt; for the Service.
						The same transport that was used to generate a list of tuples is used with each of this tuples for contacting the TURN server.
						The SRV algorithm recommends doing an A query if the SRV query returns an error or no SRV RR;
						in this case the default port declared in <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/> for the SRV service name defined in &lt;scheme&gt; MUST be used for contacting the TURN server.
						Also in this case, this specification modifies the SRV algorithm by recommending an A and AAAA query.
						If the TURN client cannot contact a TURN server at any of the IP address and port tuples returned by the SRV algorithm with the transports from the filtered list then the resolution MUST stop with an error.

			<t>
				The Application Service Tag and Application Protocol Tags defined in this document do not introduce any specific security issues beyond the security considerations discussed in <xref target="RFC3958"/>.
				<xref target="RFC3958"/> requests that an S-NAPTR application defines some form of end-to-end authentication to ensure that the correct destination has been reached.
				This is achieved for "turn" and "turns" URIs by the Long-Term Credential Mechanism defined in [RFC5389], which is mandatory for <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn">TURN</xref>.
				Additionally for a "turns" URI, the usage of TLS has the capability to address the requirement.
				In this case the client MUST verify the identity of the server by following the identification procedure in section 7.2.2 of <xref target="RFC5389"/>.

<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual

<abstract>
<t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in dealing with Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal. It can be used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to it by a NAT. It can also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints, and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings. STUN works with many existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; STUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself. Rather, it is a tool to be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution. This is an important change from the previous version of this specification (RFC 3489), which presented STUN as a complete solution.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; This document obsoletes RFC 3489.

<abstract><t>If a host is located behind a NAT, then in certain situations it can be impossible for that host to communicate directly with other hosts (peers).  In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use the services of an intermediate node that acts as a communication relay.  This specification defines a protocol, called TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT), that allows the host to control the operation of the relay and to exchange packets with its peers using the relay.  TURN differs from some other relay control protocols in that it allows a client to communicate with multiple peers using a single relay address.  The TURN protocol was designed to be used as part of the ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) approach to NAT traversal, though it can be also used without ICE.</t></abstract>

							A "turns:" URI can only use the TURN TLS transport but a "turn:" URI can use either a TURN UDP, TCP or TLS transport.
							This is because the reason for TLS is not security, but be able to traverse even a NAT that can decode Xored IP addresses, and "upgrading" from TCP to TLS is harmless.
						</t>
						<t>The Application Service Tag is "RELAY" so other relaying mechanisms than TURN (e.g., TWIST) can be registered as Application Protocol Tags.</t>
						<t>S-NAPTR was preferred to U-NAPTR because there is no use case for U-NAPTR.</t>

							&lt;password&gt; is not used in the URIs because it is deprecated.
