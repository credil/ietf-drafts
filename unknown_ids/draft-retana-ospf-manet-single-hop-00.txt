Internet-Draft     MANET Single-Hop Broadcast Networks        March 2011


1.  Introduction

   The OSPF-MANET interface [RFC5820] uses the point-to-multipoint
   adjacency model over a broadcast media to allow the following:

   o  all router-to-router connections are treated as if they were
      point-to-point links.

   o  Link metric can be set on a per-neighbor basis.

   o  Broadcast and multicast can be accomplished through the Layer 2
      broadcast capabilities of the media.

   It is clear that the characteristics of the MANET interface can also
   be beneficial in fixed network deployments; specifically in single-
   hop broadcast capable networks which may have a different cost
   associated with any pair of nodes.

   This document describes the use of the MANET interface in single-hop
   broadcast networks.

1.1.  Single-Hop Broadcast Networks

   The OSPF extensions for MANET networks assume the ad-hoc formation of
   a network over bandwidth-constrained wireless links, where packets
   may traverse several intermediate nodes before reaching their
   destination (multi-hop paths on the interface).  By contrast, a
   single-hop broadcast network (as considered in this document) is one
   that is structured in such a way that all the nodes in it are
   directly connected to each other.  An Ethernet interface is a good
   example of the connectivity model.

   Furthermore, the single-hop networks considered may have different
   link metrics associated to the connectivity between a specific pair
   of neighbors.  The OSPF broadcast model [RFC2328] can't accurately
   describe these differences.  A point-to-multipoint description is
   more appropriate given that each node can reach every other node
   directly.

   In summary, the single-hop broadcast interfaces considered in this
   document have the following characteristics:

   o  direct connectivity between all the nodes

   o  different link metrics may exist per-neighbor

   o  it has broadcast/multicast capabilities

1.2.  MANET Interface Considerations

   The operation of the MANET interface doesn't change when implemented
   on a single-hop broadcast interface.  However, some of the proposed
   enhancements are not needed; explicitly, Incremental Hellos and
   Overlapping Relays are not required due to the connectivity model.
   If Overlapping Relays are used, then the A-bit SHOULD NOT be set by
   any of the nodes: the result is an empty set of Active Overlapping
   Relays.

   Smart Peering can be used to reduce the burden of requiring a full
   mesh of adjacencies.  In short, a new adjacency is not required if
   reachability to the node is already available through the existing
   STP.  In general, the reachability is verified on a first-come-first-
   served basis; i.e. in a typical network, the neighbors with which a
   FULL adjacency is set up depend on the order of discovery.  Section 3
   explains the use of Router Priority to create a deterministic
   mechanism to select which nodes to form FULL adjacencies with.

   Section 4 explains the operation with unsynchronized adjacencies.

   The operation described in this document uses already defined
   mechanisms and requires no additional on-the-wire changes.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Use of Router Priority

   The Smart Peering state machine [RFC5820] allows for the definition
   of heuristics, beyond the SPT reachability, to decide whether or not
   it considers a new adjacency to be of value.  This section describes
   one such heuristic to be used in Step (3) of the state machine.

   The Router Priority (as defined in OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3
   [RFC5340]) is used in the election of the (Backup) Designated Router,
   and can be configured only in broadcast and NBMA interfaces.  The
   MANET interface is a broadcast interface using the point-to-
   multipoint adjacency model, which means that no (Backup) Designated
   Router is elected.  For its use with the MANET interface, the Router
   Priority is defined as:

   Router Priority
         An 8-bit unsigned integer.  Used to determine the precedence of
         which router(s) to establish a FULL adjacency with during the
         Smart Peering selection process.  When more than one router
         attached to a network is present, the one with the highest
         Router Priority takes precedence.  If there is still a tie, the
         router with the highest Router ID takes precedence.

   The heuristic for the smart peering state machine is described as:

               (3)                      |
             ,'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''|
             |             ............................                |
             |             |Determine if the number of|                |
             |             |existing adjacencies is < |                |
             |             |the maximum configured    |                |
             |             |value                     |                |
             |             '`'''''''\'''''''''''''''/''                |
             |                       \             /                   |
             |        ................\.........../..............      |
             |        |Determine if the neighbor has the highest|      |
             |        |(Router Priority, Router ID) combination |      |
             |        ''''''''''''`'''/'''''''\''''''''''''''''''      |
             |                       /         \                       |
             '`'''''''''''''''''''''/'''''''''''\'''''''''''''''''''''''

                          Smart Peering Algorithm

   In order to avoid churn in the selection and establishment of the
   adjacencies, every router SHOULD wait Wait Time [RFC2328] before
   running the Smart Peering state machine.  Note that this wait should
   cause the selection process to consider all the nodes on the link,
   instead of being triggered based on receiving a Hello message from a
   potential neighbor.  The nodes selected using this process are
   referred to simply as Smart Peers.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the maximum number of adjacencies be
   configured to at least 2.


4.  Unsynchronized Adjacencies

   An unsynchronized adjacency [RFC5820] is one for which the database
   synchronization is postponed, but that is announced as FULL because
   SPT reachability can be proven.  A single-hop broadcast network has a
   connectivity model in which all the nodes are directly connected to
   each other.  This connectivity results in a simplified reachability
   check through the SPT: the adjacency to a specific peer MUST be

Internet-Draft     MANET Single-Hop Broadcast Networks        March 2011


   advertized as FULL by at least one Smart Peer.

   The single-hop nature of the interface allows then the advertisement
   of the reachable adjacencies as FULL without additional signaling.
   Flooding SHOULD be enabled for all the unsynchronized adjacencies to
   take advantage of the broadcast nature of the media.  As a result,
   all the nodes in the interface will be able to use all the LSAs
   received.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   No new security concerns beyond the ones expressed in RFC 5820
   [RFC5820] are introduced in this document.  In fact, due to the
   application in fixed networks, some of the concerns may actually be
   reduced.
