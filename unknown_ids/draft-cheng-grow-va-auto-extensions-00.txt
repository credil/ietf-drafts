          Auto-Configuration Extention in Virtual Aggregation
                 draft-cheng-grow-va-auto-extensions-00

Abstract

   Auto-Configuration in Virtual Aggregation as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-grow-va-auto] requires configuration of a "VP-range list"
   in ASBRs connected to transit and peer ISPs.  These ASBRs simply tag
   some routes whose prefix falls within the VP-Range with a "can-
   suppress" tag to indicate whether these routes should be FIB
   installed.  This draft specified an extended auto-configuration
   mechanism in Virtual Aggregation to support the configuration of both
   "VP-List" and "popular prefixes".  Specifically, based on this
   mechanism, the ratio of lost packets when VP routes fail could be
   minimized.

Internet-Draft        Auto-Configuration Extention        September 2011


1.  Introduction

   Virtual Aggregation specified in [I-D.ietf-grow-va] requires
   configuration of a static "VP-List" on all routers.  "VP-List" allows
   routers to know which prefixes may or may not be FIB installed.
   Auto-configuration mechanism [I-D.ietf-grow-va-auto] provides an
   optional method for routers to do routes decision with less
   configuration.

   Auto-configuration is an optional alternative to the VP-list that
   requires far less configuration.  However, further concentrates
   should be focused on some scenarios where packets transmission maybe
   seriously influenced based on this mechanism.  Furthermore, this
   mechanism could also be extended to provide more excellent service.

   This draft specifies Auto-Configuration Extension Operation, which
   includes the following two aspects:

   o  VP routes to be specified particularly.  Based on current auto-
      configuration, tagging routers must not tag VP routes with can-
      suppress tag.  If the ISP has a policy of FIB-installing customer
      routes, then routes received from customers should also not be
      tagged.  Consequently, there may be three kinds of routes are non-
      tagged in the AS: routes whose prefix out scope of VP-Range, VP
      routes and customer routes.  According to these tagging rules,
      non-tagging routers will not be able to identify VP routes.  As a
      result, in the case where all VP routes for a given VP are
      withdrawn, non-tagging routers would not be able to FIB-install
      sub-prefixes within the VP.  This will influence the normal
      transmission of data packets seriously.

   o  Extensions to realize popular prefixes auto-configuration.  As
      specified in [I-D.ietf-grow-va], deployment of Visual Aggregation
      will cause path stretch.  To minimize the latency and load
      associated with the longer path, ISP could measure traffic volume
      over time and install the high volume prefixes.  These prefixes
      which are within a VP, but still be FIB installed are called
      popular prefixes.  Furthermore, popular prefixes could also be
      consisted of policy-based prefixes and static list prefixes.
      Customer prefixes could be considered as one kind of policy- based
      prefixes.  Consequently, tagging routers could also be configured
      with a popular prefixes list, and realize popular prefixes auto-
      configuration by not tag routes whose prefix falls within this
      list.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   This draft uses terms defined in [I-D.ietf-grow-va].  This section
   defines some new terms used in this document.

   Tagging router:   ASBRs which are configured with "VP range" and
      "Popular-Prefix list".  These routers tag routes with different
      tags based on route type.  Typically, all ASBRs that connect to
      one or more transit provider ISPs must be configured as tagging
      routers.  ASBRs that connect to one or more peer ISPs should be
      configured as tagging routers.  ASBRs that connect to customer
      networks should not be configured as tagging routers.

   Non-tagging router:  The VA routers in AS which are not tagging
      routers.

   Popular-Prefix list:  List of popular prefixes.

   Suppress tag:  Tags used by tagging routers to tag routes.  Routes
      with this tag may not be FIB installed by routers.  This tag could
      be attached to a route as a Non-transitive Extended Communities
      Attribute.

   Install tag:  Tags used by tagging routers to tag routes.  Router
      with this tag must be FIB installed by any router.  This tag could
      be attached to a route as a Non-transitive Extended Communities
      Attribute.


3.  Specification

3.1.  Routes Classification and Routes Tagging

   With this extended auto-configuration approach, every tagging router
   will be configured with the same "VP-range list" and "popular prefix
   list".

   "VP-range list" consists of the ranges of IP address that are
   collectively covered by all VPs in the AS [I-D.ietf-grow-va-auto].
   "Popular-Prefix list" is a list of popular prefixes.  These popular
   prefixes are all regular prefixes, and could be selected by ISPs



Cheng & Sun               Expires March 8, 2012                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        Auto-Configuration Extention        September 2011


   individually based on their requirements.

   With the extended auto-configuration approach, ASBRs which are
   tagging routers first classify all routes into three types based on
   the "VP range" and "Popular-Prefix list" configured in them:

   Type1:  VP routes which MUST be FIB installed by any router;
   Type2:  Routes whose prefix falls within "Popular-Prefix list", and
           routes whose prefix is not fall within "VP range";
   Type3:  Routes whose prefix falls within "VP range", and meantime are
           out scope of Type 1 and Type 2 routes.

   Tagging routers tag routes explicitly according to route types.

   1.  All VP routes (type 1) MUST be tagged with a "install tag".
   2.  All routes falls within Type 2 SHOULD NOT be tagged.
   3.  All routes falls within Type 3 MAYBE tagged with a "suppress
       tag".

3.2.  Routes Installation

   Routers install or suppress FIB entries according to the following
   rules.

   1.  Routes with "install tag" MUST be FIB-installed.
   2.  Routes without any tag SHOULD be FIB-installed.
   3.  Routes with "suppress tag" MAY be FIB-suppressed.
   4.  APRs MUST FIB-install routes for sub-prefixes that fall within
       the APRs!_ VPs, whether or not the route is tagged.

      Note: tagging routers conceptually follow these rules after
      tagging (or not tagging) the route.
      Note: these rules apply only to the route used by the routers as
      the best route.

3.3.  Implementation

   An instance of mechanism operation is depicted in this subsection.
   Consider the scenario depicted in Figure. 1.

                                 Figure. 1

   In this situation, an ASBR connected to transit network (23.1.1.0/24)
   and peer network (22.1.0.0/16) is selected to be a TR (tagging
   router).  TR is configured with a VP range 22/7 and a popular prefix
   list contains 23.1.1.0/24.  The NTR1 (Non-Tagging Router 1) is an APR
   (Aggregate Point Router) who announces a VP route 22/8.

   To describe operation of different elements, assume that following
   routes will be received by TR, NTR1 and NTR2.


                        Routes             Prefix
                      -------------------------------
                          1                 22/8
                          2              22.1.1.1/32
                          3              22.1.0.1/32
                          4              23.1.1.1/32


   TR Operation:

   o  For route with prefix 22/8, as this route is a VP route announced
      by NTR1, TR will tag it with a "install tag".
   o  The prefix 22.1.1.1/32 falls within the popular prefix list, TR
      will not tag it, although the route's prefix falls within the VP
      range.

   o  TR perceives that prefix 22.1.0.1/32 falls within the VP range and
      is not a popular prefix.  This route will be tagged with a
      "suppress tag".
   o  For route with prefix 23.1.1.1/32, as the prefix falls within VP
      range 22/7, this route will also be tagged with a "suppress tag".

   NTR Operation:

   o  For route with prefix 22/8, as this route is tagged with "install
      tag", all NTRs must FIB install it.
   o  For route with prefix 22.1.1.1/32, as this route is not tagged,
      NTRs should FIB install it.  Especially for NTR1, as the prefix
      falls within the VP (22/8) it announced, it must FIB install the
      route.

   It should be noticed that in this scenario, NTR1 is an APR, and NTR2
   is a non-APR.  These two kinds of routers will implement different
   operation upon some suppress tagged routes.

   o  According to NTR2, as the router is a non-APR, all routes with
      "suppress tag" should not be installed.  As a result, NTR2 will
      not FIB install 22.1.0.1/32 and 23.1.1.1/32.

   o  Now consider the operation of NTR1.
      *  FOr the route 22.1.0.1/32 with "suppress tag", NTR1 perceives
         that prefix falls within 22/8, and will FIB install the route.
      *  According to route 23.1.1.1/32 with "suppress tag", NTR1
         doesn't have to FIB install it, as NTR1 is not the APR for this
         route.


4.  Operation under Special Scenario

   Based on analysis in section 1, when VP routes are not tagged
   specially, VP routes failing will influence the packets transmission
   seriously.

   From perspective of non-tagging routers, VP routes could be
   identified through the "install tag" based on extended auto-
   configuration mechanism.  This section assumes a special scenario
   that all VP routes for a given VP are withdrawn.  Proper operation of
   tagging routers and non-tagging routers is described as following.

4.1.  Non-tagging Routers Operation

   When the non-tagging routers find that all VP routes for a given VP
   withdrawn, they will immediately look up the routing table in the
   RIB, select and FIB install the suppress tagged routes whose prefixes



Cheng & Sun               Expires March 8, 2012                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Auto-Configuration Extention        September 2011


   fall within the withdrawn VP.

4.2.  Tagging Routers Operation

   When the tagging routers find that all VP routes for a given VP are
   withdrawn, they will implement the following operation:

   o  Look up the routing table in the RIB, select and FIB install the
      suppress tagged routes whose prefixes fall within the withdrawn
      VP;
   o  Record VP information of the withdrawn VP routes;
   o  When there is an invalid record for a given VP, all routes
      received by the tagging routers whose prefixs falls within this VP
      should not be tagged.

   According to existence of invalid VP records, once receiving a VP
   route, tagging routers will compare the VP prefix received with the
   VP prefixes recorded.  If the received prefix match an invalid prefix
   record, they will implement the following operation:

   o  Delete the invalid VP prefix record;
   o  Tag received VP route with "install tag";
   o  Tag all Type 3 routes whose prefix falls within this VP with
      "suppress tag".

4.3.  Implementation

   Consider the implementation usecase depicted in Figure. 1.  Assume
   that all VP routes for the VP 22/8 are withdrawn.

   According to this problem, NTRs (include APRs) check their routing
   table in RIB, and find out suppress tagged routes whose prefixes fall
   within the VP 22/8, such as routes with 22.1.0.1/32.  NTRs will FIB
   install these routes, and forward packets based on them.

   According to this problem, TRs will also FIB install the suppressed
   tagged routes whose prefixes fall within the VP 22/8.  Furthermore,
   TRs will record the prefix information of VP 22/8.  During the period
   that VP 22/8 is withdrawn, all routes whose prefix falls within the
   VP will not be tagged by TRs, indicates that routes such like
   22.1.1.1/32 and 22.1.0.1/32 should be FIB installed.

   Every TR maintains a record of the withdrawn VP 22/8.  When the TR
   receives a new VP route with prefix 22/8, it will consider this
   situation as "VP Recovery".  Withdrawn record of 22/8 will be
   deleted, and the new VP route will be tagged with "install tag".
   Furthermore, the Type 3 routes whose prefixes fall within the 22/8
   such as 22.1.0.1/32 will be tagged with "suppress tag".
