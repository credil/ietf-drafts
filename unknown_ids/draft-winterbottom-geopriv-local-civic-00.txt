Internet-Draft                 Local Civic                September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Geopriv civic location specification [RFC5139] defines an XML
   schema that are intended to allow the expression of civic location in
   most countries.  It was recognized that some countries may require a
   profile or guidance on how to specify local addresses using the
   elements defined in [RFC5139] and so [RFC5774] was produced to
   provide this function.  Subsequent to these specifications being
   produced, a number of individual contributions have been made trying
   to add additional civic elements to address local jurisdictional
   requirements.  These contributions were specified in such a away that
   broke backward compatibility for protocols equipment, and other
   standards already using the [RFC5139] specification.

   This document defines a method that allows the specification of local
   civic address elements inside a [RFC5139] object.  It further allows
   these local civic elements to be carried over DHCP using [RFC4776],
   HELD [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery], and LoST [RFC5222]
   without modification and so maintain backward compatibility with
   existing specifications and implementations.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Specifying Local Civic Elements

   The civic schema in [RFC5139] defines an ordered structure of
   elements that can be combined to describe a street address.  The XML
   extension point at the bottom of the schema is used to include
   address elements of local significance into the main civic body.

   For example, suppose the Central Devon Canals authority wishes to
   introduce a new civic element called "bridge".  The authority must
   define an XML namespace and define the "bridge" element within that
   namespace.  The namespace needs to be a URI and needs to be unique,
   for example "http://www.central.devon.canals.org/ns1.0".  Finally,
   the authority can create a civic address that includes the new
   "bridge" element at the bottom.

         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr">

      </cdc:bridge>

    </civicAddress>

   Alternatively, the local namespace can be included at the top of the
   document, and just the namespace prefix and element is used later in
   the structure to define the actual local elements, as shown in
   Figure 2.

      <civicAddress xml:lang="en-AU"
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr"
           xmlns:cdc="http://www.central.devon.canals.org/ns1.0">
        <country>UK</country>
        <A1>Devon</A1>
        <A3>Monkokehampton/A3>
        <RD>Deckport</RD>
        <STS>Cross</STS>

        <cdc:bridge>21451338</cdc:bridge>

      </civicAddress>


         Figure 2: Local Civic Object Early Namespace Declaration

   Nodes that receive the location information but don't understand the
   locally specified address elements can safely ignore them, yet still
   interpret the main civic elements from [RFC5139] and so maintain
   backward compatibility.  Where the information is passed to local
   applications, such as a LoST server for emergency call routing, the
   significance of the localized elements can be safely applied.  This
   allows localized address elements to be included in a location
   response from a LIS using HELD without modification being required to
   the HELD protocol or the HELD client on the device.

3.1.  Localized Elements Using DHCP

   In networks that elect to use DHCP to provide civic address
   information to clients, three new CATypes are defined to address this
   basic functionality.  These CATypes are treated as a triplet of
   information.  The first CAType contains the namespace in which the
   localized address elements are defined.  The second CAType is a label
   containing the local name of the element in the previously provided
   namespace.  The third CAType contains the value attributed to the
   specified element.  If additional elements are required from the same
   localized namespace then namespace CAType does not need to be sent a
   second time, all localized element value pairs will be attributed to
   the previously provided namespace.  For example, the
   "http://www.central.devon.canals.org/ns1.0" namespace used in the
   previous example may define a pylonCount for the bridge also, this
   may be conveyed as shown in Figure 3.

      ... CAType=XX Value="http://www.central.devon.canals.org/ns1.0"
          CAType=YY Value="bridge"
          CAType=ZZ Value="21451338"
          CAType=YY Value="pylonCount"
          CAType=ZZ Value="2"...

4.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a formal way to extend the existing Geopriv
   civic schema.  No security threats are introduced by this document.
   Security threats applicable to configuring a device with a civic
   address using DHCP are specified in [RFC4776].  Security threats
   applicable to providing a device with its civic location using HELD
   are specific in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery]


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the civic address type registry established by
   [RFC4776].  Three additional value are added:

   XX "NameSpace":  Namespace in which the local address elements are
      defined

   YY  "Element":  Local address element containing the value

   ZZ  "Value":  Value of the local address element

   [[IANA/RFC-EDITOR: Please replace XX, YY, ZZ with the allocated civic
   address type number assigned from the pool]]
