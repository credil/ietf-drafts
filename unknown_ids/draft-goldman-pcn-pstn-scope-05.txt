Internet-Draft          PSTN scope of PCN Charter             March 2009


Abstract

   The IETF PCN Working Group has continued its work investigating pre-
   congestion and admission control mechanisms.  This work has
   progressed under the current charter, but has not yet considered
   related legacy PSTN interactions or the need for ubiquitous
   connectivity between users on dissimilar networks.  The PCN charter
   could be improved by a strong positive statement to the effect
   committing to future work addressing legacy networks.

   In that light, please consider the questions below which include
   differential PCN treatment based on traffic types, security, and PSTN
   interoperability concerns.  It seems helpful to have a touchstone of
   some concerns relative to the PSTN network and IP network Gateway in
   order to confirm that they will be addressed in future work.  This
   attempt is motivated by a desire to avoid the accidental omission of
   a topic that may be hard to "retrofit" in later.

Internet-Draft          PSTN scope of PCN Charter             March 2009


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] .

2.  Introduction

   Experience in the legacy PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) and
   associated network management has taught that there are certain types
   of traffic that should be addressed differently than POTS (Plain Old
   Telephone Service).  Examples are mass calling events and auto
   dialers.

   For the foreseeable future the legacy PSTN will co-exist with the
   newer IP based networks.  Is there a need that Pre-congestion and
   congestion signaling be sent from the core to gateways into the PSTN?
   Similarly is there a need for PSTN gateways to inform the IP core of
   congestion within the PSTN?  While these concerns may not be within
   scope of the initial PCN charter, it may be worthwhile to address if
   such needs do exist and if so, what would be the best course of
   action for the PCN working group.

   The charter discusses ingress and egress nodes but does not
   explicitly discuss the situation where these nodes may be gateways to
   the PSTN.  Is there a belief that the interconnection to the legacy
   PSTN can be treated as an edge, or the same as the interconnection
   between two IP based networks, or is there sufficient reason to
   believe that this interface may have unique characteristics that need
   to be specifically addressed?  Given that a significant portion of
   the legacy equipment in the PSTN is less likely to evolve to
   specially address unique aspects of interconnection with IP based
   networks, it seems that one significant constraint on the industry
   would be that any adaptation needed to work with PCN would need to
   occur at the PSTN gateways and need to be encompassed in the
   characteristics of the PCN mechanisms.  The trust model in the legacy
   PSTN model may differ fundamentally from that in the interconnection
   of IP based networks.  We have not yet researched such
   characteristics, but feel the question should at least be raised
   here.

   We understand that these concerns may be out of scope of the initial
   work as it extends beyond a single domain, but may be addressed in
   future work as indicated by the text below from the charter.

   "After completion of the initial phase, the PCN WG may re-charter to
   develop solutions for scenarios where some of these restrictions are
   not in place.  It may also re-charter to consider applying the PCN

   mechanisms to additional deployment scenarios (operation over
   concatenated DiffServ domains, PCN-aware application mechanisms,
   etc.).  The WG may also consider to investigate additional response
   mechanisms that act on (pre-)congestion information.  One example
   could be flow-rate adaptation (rather than flow admission/
   termination) during times of congestion.  The details of these work
   items are outside the scope of the initial phase; but the WG may
   consider their requirements to design components that are
   sufficiently general to support such extensions in the future."

3.  Differential PCN Treatment based on Types of Traffic

   As we understand the PCN operation, it would be the responsibility of
   the ingress nodes to control the offered traffic and it would be
   outside the scope of the initial charter to address exactly how this
   control should be applied.  Nevertheless it does seem to be helpful
   for understanding if the charter could at least provide recognition
   of mass calling events, auto dialers, and other non-"POTS" traffic
   types.  The charter should provide guidance that the ingress node may
   address these traffic types separately.

4.  PSTN Interoperability Concerns

4.1.  Considerations Regarding Traffic Offered from the PSTN Gateway
      toward the Core

4.1.1.  Gateway reliance on PCN messages from the core

   Is it reasonable for the PSTN gateway to rely on the IP network to
   send sufficient PCN messages to the gateway allowing the gateway to
   then limit the traffic its sends into the core?  Conversely, can the
   core rely on the PSTN gateways to be responsive to PCN messages?
   Unless these concerns are eventually addressed, it would appear that
   PCN may not be as effective in this configuration as would be
   possible.

4.1.2.  Traditional Network Management

   Should the PSTN and gateway also explore more traditional network
   management controls to prevent exceeding the allocated traffic
   offered to the core?  Unless such exploration occurs PCN may not be
   as effective in this configuration as would be possible.

   Should the PSTN and gateway also provide exemptions to traditional
   network management controls for high priority calls?

4.1.3.  Mass Calling

   Will there be any consideration of using PCN messages to control Mass
   Calling Events from the PSTN into the core?  Mass Calling Events are
   significantly different than general traffic so that special
   consideration should be given to controlling the traffic generated by
   them.

4.1.4.  Hard to reach

   Will there be any consideration of using PCN messages to control
   sending traffic to hard to reach destinations (hard to reach codes)
   into the core?  Hard to reach destinations are significantly
   different than general traffic so that special consideration should
   be given to controlling the traffic generated by them.

4.2.  Considerations Regarding Traffic Offered to the PSTN Gateway from
      the Core

4.2.1.  Gateway sending PCN messages to the core

   Should there be a consideration for the PTSN gateway to be able to
   send PCN messages toward the core when the PSTN is in precongestion
   or congestion?

4.2.2.  Traditional Network Management

   Should the PSTN and gateway also explore more traditional network
   management controls to control the traffic being passed on to the
   PSTN from the gateway so as to not exceed the allocated traffic
   offered to the PSTN network?

   Should the PSTN and gateway also provide exemptions to traditional
   network management controls for high priority calls?

4.2.3.  Mass Calling

   Will there be any consideration of using PCN messages to control Mass
   Calling Events to the PSTN from the core?  Mass Calling Events are
   significantly different than general traffic so that special
   consideration should be given to controlling the traffic generated by
   them.

4.2.4.  Hard to reach

   Will there be any consideration of using PCN messages to control
   sending traffic to hard to reach destinations (hard to reach codes)
   into the PSTN?  Hard to reach destinations are significantly

   different than general traffic so that special consideration should
   be given to controlling the traffic generated by them.

5.  Proposal

   It does seem to be helpful for understanding if the charter could at
   least provide recognition of mass calling events, auto dialers, and
   other non-"POTS" traffic types. the charter should provide guidance
   that the ingress node may address these separately.

   Given the reality that the legacy PSTN will continue to exist for a
   considerable period of time, and the need for ubiquitous connectivity
   between users on the dissimilar networks, it seems to us that the
   charter could be improved by a strong positive statement to the
   effect committing to future work to address the unique aspects of PCN
   with regard to legacy networks as well as having this constraint in
   mind during the work under the initial charter.

6.  Security Considerations

   Traffic can be disrupted if malicious PCN messages are sent.  The
   potential of a denial of service attack exists in that fraudulent PCN
   messages could result in a considerable percentage of legitimate
   subscriber traffic being blocked.  At this point it appears that
   there is corresponding risk in both the IP networks and the legacy
   PSTN.

7.  IANA Considerations

   None.
