               Policy Signaling for Multi-access Mobility
            draft-koodli-policy-multiaccess-mobility-00.txt

Abstract

   The mobile nodes are increasingly capable of simultaneous multi-radio
   connectivity.  This allows them to be attached to the Internet
   through multiple access technologies at the same time.  With such
   multi-access, the mobile node (MN) can make use of the best-available
   access technology for a particular application at any given time.
   And, the network may be able to balance the flow of traffic across
   the available access technologies.  The Mobile IPv6 flow binding work
   provides a mechanism for the MN to signal the Home Agent to balance
   the flows based on the MN'e needs.  This document specifies a simple
   protocol for a mobile IP gateway (such as a Mobile IP Home Agent or a
   Proxy Mobile IP Local Mobility Anchor) to signal the MN of gateway's
   policy for traffic treatment across access technologies.  Based on
   the response and the prevailing network conditions, the gateway then
   balances the traffic.

Internet-Draft            Policy-Based Mobility               March 2011


1.  Introduction

   Mobile Nodes are increasingly able to operate multiple radios
   simultaneously.  This capability allows them to be attached to the
   Internet through multiple access technologies simultaneously.  Such
   multi-access connectivity can provide a Mobile Node (MN) with better
   experience by binding flows to the best-available access
   technologies.  From the network point of view, it can provide a
   better traffic balancing across available access technologies.

   The design priniciple of existing work on flow binding [RFC6089]
   follows the original Mobile IP design in which an MN signals the Home
   Agent (HA) when any mobility action is necessary.  This design
   addresses the problem from the "MN's perspective" and works fine
   whenever the MN is able to inform the network of flow mobility.  The
   corresponding "Network perspective" to traffic balancing across
   access technologies is missing.  There can be times when the network
   may wish to indicate the desired policy to the MN based on the
   overall traffic conditions present at the network.  The eventual
   disposition may still be subject to conditions local to the MN, but
   the network's preference of traffic type and access type may need to
   be indicated to the MN.  For example, consider that a single prefix
   is advertised on two different access types.  At any given time, how
   does the MN choose one access type over another for a particular
   flow, and for how long?  This is subject to the policy local to the
   MN, but the network itself has a role to play in establishing and
   enforcing such a policy.  The network may want the MN to use, subject
   to connectivity conditions, Access Technology Type X (ATTx) for a set
   of flows until the next Z seconds, and then revert back to Access
   Technology Type Y (ATTy) for those flows.

   There is no mechanism in IP mobility that allows the mobile gateway
   to express its desired policy for mapping a set of flows to a
   particular access technology for a certain configrauble duration of
   time.  Policy here is a construct that maps flows to access types for
   a certain duration of time.  This document specifies a protocol that
   enables 1) an HA to express its policy to a MN, and 2) an LMA to
   express its policy to a Mobility Anchor Gateway (MAG), which may then
   relay it to the MN through appropriate L2 signaling.  The policy
   signaling is a Request - Response procedure in which the recipient
   responds to the expressed policy based on the local conditions.  This
   document specifies the access technology, flow filter and duration
   for the policy for a particular MN.  New policy attributes may be
   defined in the future.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL", in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The document uses the terminology specified in [RFC5213] and in
   [RFC3775].  In addition, this document defines the following:

      Access Technology Type (ATT): The type of radio access technology
      used by the MN.  The examples include cellular, WiFi and Femto
      networks.

      Flow Handover: Network-initiated handover of one or more
      application flows from one network interface to another.

      Flow Filter: a parameter set that identifies a flow.  An example
      wildcard Flow Filter is a Prefix.

      Flow Policy Request (FPRQ): A message sent by the LMA requesting a
      MAG to establish forwarding for one or more application flows of a
      MN for the duration specified.  It is also a message sent by the
      HA to the MN.  This message contains one or more flow filters, the
      target Access Technology Type (ATT) for those flow filters and the
      time in seconds for which the the flow handover is requested to be
      valid.

      Flow Policy Reply (FPRP): A reply from the MAG to the LMA
      containing the resolution of FPRQ message.  Prior to accepting the
      FPRQ message, the MAG may consult any appropriate entity to ensure
      that the MN has suitable connectivity conditions for the desired
      flow mobility.  The interaction between the MAG and any other
      entity is outside the scope of this document.  An FPRP is also a
      reply message from a MN to the HA.

      Flow Forwarding Entry (FFE): A logical data structure used to
      store the flow forwarding information as a result of processing
      the FPRQ and FPRP messages.



3.  Protocol

   The session creation at the LMA follows the basic model of RFC 5213.
   At the time of attach, one or more prefixes are assigned to the MN
   corresponding to the ATT.  Those prefixes may be common across the
   ATTs the MN is using or they may be unique to each ATT.  When the LMA
   signals the MAG with an FPRQ message, it is essentially requesting if



Koodli & Chowdhury      Expires September 9, 2011               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            Policy-Based Mobility               March 2011


   the policy for flow mobility is acceptable to the MAG based on the
   prevailing network conditions.  The policy states that the LMA wants
   the identified flows be supported over the ATT indicated for the
   duration specified.  The target prefix itself may already be valid on
   the ATT.  However, traffic flow corresponding to that prefix may not
   be best-suited under the prevailing network conditions.  Hence, the
   LMA verfies if the impending flow mobility is acceptable before
   actually enforcing it.

   The conditions permitting, the MAG responds with a Status indicating
   that flow mobility is acceptable in the FPRP message.  The MAG may
   consult any other network element in order to verify that the access
   network conditions are acceptable for flow mobility.  The MAG MAY
   inform the MN about the network policy through appropriate L2
   signaling.  When such L2 signaling is unavailable, the MN MUST be
   prepared to accept packets on any applicable access technology
   interface, and transmit the return packets back on the same interface
   [LI-draft].  When conditions are not suitable for flow handover, the
   MAG responds with an appropriate Status code in the FPRP message.
   The LMA MUST NOT handover the flow to the ATT indicated in the FPRQ
   message.  The LMA MAY initiate a new FPRQ message at a later time.

   The behavior of the protocol for Mobile IPv6 is similar.  The HA
   sends an FPRQ message to the MN indicating the policy preference for
   a flow.  The MN responds with its willingness (or not) with the FPRP
   message.  Once the policy is known, the MN may use the protocol
   specified in [RFC6089] to actually bind a flow to an access
   technology interface.

   The signaling may take place any time.  The flow treatment policy is
   valid for the duration agreed in the signaling exchange or until the
   next round of signaling exchange.  The default policy is provided by
   the network at the time a mobility session is created using the
   (Proxy) Binding Update and (Proxy) Binding Acknowledge signaling.
   These messages MUST include one or more Flow Policy Object options
   specified in this document.

   The flow treatment policy may be rescinded any time.  For instance,
   the LMA (HA) may send a FPRQ message with a request to terminate an
   existing flow policy.  Such a message may be generated as a result of
   termination of an application flow.  The flow forwarding policy has a
   default lifetime, upon the expiry of which the forwarding reverts to
   the default flow forwarding policy.  When flow forwarding service
   ceases, the corresponding logical datastructure entries MUST be
   removed.

   At any point in time, a MAG or a MN may send an Unsolicited FPRP
   (U-FPRP) message to indicate events such as FFE lifetime renewal or a

   MN moving out of coverage.  The LMA (HA) sends an FPRQ message to
   confirm the renewal of FFE lifetime.  When the event indicates a MN
   moving out of coverage, the LMA sends FPRQ to cancel an existing flow
   forwarding service.  In any case, the MAG MUST wait for the FPRQ
   message to confirm the corresponding action by the LMA before
   concluding on its own.  When flow forwarding service is cancelled,
   forwarding takes place according to the normal (P)MIP6 tunneling.

   The decision to handover the flow from one interface to another may
   be conveyed to the MN using access-specific signaling.  In the
   absence of such signaling, the MN needs to be prepared to accept
   packets on an interface other than the one which initiated the
   application flow in the first place.


4.  Message Formats

4.1.  Flow Policy Request (FPRQ)

   The LMA (HA) sends an FPRQ message to a MAG (MN) to request flow
   handover of one or more application flows of a MN.  The Flow Policy
   Object present in the message identifies the flows and their target
   ATT.

      Sequence Number: A monotonically increasing integer.  Set by a
      sending node in a request message, and used to match a reply to
      the request.

      'R' flag: Set to 1, indicates it is an FPRP message.

      'U' flag: When set to 1, the FPRP message is sent unsolicited.
      The Lifetime field indicates a new requested value.  Lifetime set
      to zero indicates that the MN is no longer attached to the MAG.
      The MAG MUST wait for the regular FPRQ message to confirm that the
      request is acceptable to the LMA.

      Reserved: This field is unused.  MUST be set zero.

      Status: The following codes are currently defined.  New codes may
      be specified in the future.


         0: Success

         1: Failure, unable to establish flow policy due to poor
         connectivity

         2: Failure, unable to establish flow policy due to charging
         limitations

      Lifetime: The time in seconds for which the flow forwarding is
      supported.  Typically copied from the corresponding field in the
      FPRQ message.

      Mobility Options: When Status code is 0, no options may be
      present.  When the Status code is other than 0, the Flow Policy
      Object for which the flow policy could not be applied MUST be
      included in the order they were present in the FPRQ message.



5.  Security Considerations

   The protocol specified in this document uses the same security
   association between the LMA and the MAG to protect the FPRQ and FPRP
   messages.  Similarly, the protocol uses the same security association
   between the HA and the MN to protect the FPRQ and FPRP signaling
   messages.  No new security risks are identified.  Support for
   integrity protection using IPsec is required, but support for
   confidentiality is not necessary.
