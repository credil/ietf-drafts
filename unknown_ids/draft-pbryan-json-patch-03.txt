Internet-Draft                 JSON Patch                  December 2011


1.  Introduction

   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] is a common format for
   the exchange and storage of structured data.  HTTP PATCH [RFC5789]
   extends HTTP [RFC2616] with a method to perform partial modifications
   to resources.

   The JSON Patch media type "application/json-patch" is a JSON document
   structure for expressing a sequence of partial modifications to a
   JSON document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Document Structure

   A JSON Patch document contains a JSON array of objects.  Each object
   contains a single operation to apply to the target JSON document.

   A sample JSON Patch document:

   [
       { "test": "/a/b/c", value: "foo" },
       { "remove": "/a/b/c" },
       { "add": "/a/b/c", "value": [ "foo", "bar" ] },
       { "replace": "/a/b/c", "value": 42 },
       { "move": "/a/b/c", to: "/a/b/d" }
   ]

   Evaluation of a JSON Patch document begins with a target JSON
   document to modify.  Operations are applied sequentially in the order
   they appear in the array.  Each operation in the sequence is applied
   to the target document.  The resulting modified document becomes the
   target for the next operation.  The process repeats until all
   operations are successfully applied.


4.  Operations

   The operation to perform is expressed in the name of a member in the
   operation object; it's value is a string containing a [JSON Pointer],
   which references the value for which to apply the operation.  It is
   an error condition if an operation object contains more than one

   operation member.

4.1.  add

   The "add" operation adds a new value into the target document.  The
   value to be added is specified in the operation object's "value"
   member.

   If adding to an object, it is an error condition if the member to be
   added in the object already exists.

   If adding to an array, all elements at or above the specified index
   are shifted one position to the right.  It is an error condition if
   the specified index is greater than the number of elements in the
   existing array.

4.2.  remove

   The "remove" operation removes a value from the target document.

   If removing an element from an array, all elements above the
   specified index are shifted one position to the left.

   It is an error condition if the value to be removed does not exist.

4.3.  replace

   The "replace" operation replaces an existing value in the target
   document with a new value.  The value to replace the existing value
   with is specified in the operation object's "value" member.

   This operation is semantically equivalent to expressing a "remove"
   operation for a value, followed immediately by an "add" operation at
   the same location of the removed value.

   It is an error condition if the value to be replaced does not exist.

4.4.  move

   The "move" operation moves a value from one location to another
   within the target document.  The location to move the value to is
   specified in the operation object's "to" member, a string containing
   a JSON Pointer.

   This operation is semantically equivalent to expressing a "remove"
   operation, followed immediately by an "add" operation with the
   removed value.

   It is an error condition if the value to be moved does not exist, or
   if the location to move the value to already has a value.

4.5.  test

   The "test" operation tests that a value in the target document is
   equal to the specified value.  The value to test for is specified in
   the operation object's "value" member.

   It is an error condition if the value in the target document is not
   equal to the specified value.


5.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Patch
   document SHOULD terminate and application of the entire patch
   document MUST NOT be deemed successful.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The Internet media type for a JSON Patch document is application/
   json-patch.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  json-patch

   Required parameters:  none

   Optional parameters:   none

   Encoding considerations:
      Per JSON [RFC4627]: 8bit if UTF-8; binary if UTF-16 or UTF-32.

   Security considerations:
      See Security Considerations in section 8.

   Interoperability considerations:  N/A

   Published specification:
      draft-pbryan-json-patch-03

   Applications that use this media type:
      Applications that manipulate JSON documents.
