    Redaction of Potentially Sensitive Data from Mail Abuse Reports
                      draft-ietf-marf-redaction-03

Abstract

   Email messages often contain information which might be considered
   private or sensitive, per either regulation or social norms.  When
   such a message becomes the subject of a report intended to be shared
   with other entities, the report generator may wish to redact or elide
   the sensitive portions of the message.  This memo suggests one method
   for doing so effectively.

Internet-Draft                  Redaction                  November 2011


1.  Introduction

   [ARF] defines a message format for sending reports of abuse in the
   messaging infrastructure, with an eye toward automating both the
   generating and consumption of those reports.

   For privacy considerations it might be the policy of a report
   generator to redact, or obscure, portions of the report that might
   identify an end user that caused the report to be generated.
   Precisely how this is done is unspecified in [ARF] as it will
   generally be a matter of local policy.  That specification does
   admonish generators against being too over-zealous with this
   practice, as obscuring too much data makes the report non-actionable.

   Previous redaction practices, such as replacing local-parts of
   addresses with a uniform string like "xxxxxxxx", often frustrates any
   kind of prioritizing or grouping of reports.

   Generally, it is assumed that the recipient-identifying fields of a
   message, when copied into a report, are to be obscured to protect the
   identity of then end user who submitted the complaint about the
   message.  However, it is also presumed that other data will be left
   intact, and that data could theoretically be correlated against log
   files or other resources to determine the intended recipient of the
   message.


2.  Recommended Practice

   To enable correlation of reports that might refer to a common but
   anonymous source, the following redaction practice is recommended
   (but not required):

   1.  Select an arbitrary string that will be used by an Administrative
       Domain (ADMD) that generates reports.  This string will not be
       changed except according to a key rotation policy or similar.
       Call this the "redaction key".
   2.  Identify string(s) (such as local-parts of email addresses) in a
       message that need to be redacted.  Call this the "private data".
   3.  Construct a new string that is a copy of the redaction key with
       the private data concatenated to it.
   4.  Compute a digest of that string with any hashing/digest algorithm
       such as one defined in [FIPS-180-3-2008].
   5.  Encode that hash with the base64 algorithm as defined in [MIME].
   6.  Replace the private data with the encoded hash when generating
       the report.

   This has the effect of obscuring the data in an irreversible way but

   still allows the report recipient to observe that numerous reports
   are about one particular end user.  Such detection enables the
   receiver to prioritize its reactions based on problems that appear to
   be focused on specific end users that may be under attack.


3.  Security Considerations

3.1.  General

   General security issues with respect to these reports are found in
   [ARF].

3.2.  Digest Collisions

   Message digest collisions are a well-understood issue.  Their
   application here involves a report receiver improperly concluding
   that two pieces of redacted information were originally the same when
   in fact they are not.  This can lead to a denial of service, where
   the inadvertently improper application of complaint data causes
   unjustified corrective action.  Such cases are sufficiently unlikely
   as to be of little concern.

3.3.  Information Not Redacted

   Although the identity of a report generator can be redacted using
   this mechanism, other properties of a message (such as the Message-ID
   field) that are not redacted could be used to recover the original
   data.  It is incumbent on the report generator to anticipate and
   redact or otherwise obscure such data, or accept that such recovery
   is possible.

   [FBL-BCP] and Section 8 of [ARF] discuss topics related to
   establishment of bilateral agreements between report producers and
   consumers.  The issues raised here are also things to be considered
   when establishing such agreements.


4.  Privacy Considerations

   While the method of redaction described in this document may reduce
   the likelihood of some types of private data from leaking between
   Administrative Domains, it is extremely unlikely that report
   generation software could ever be created to recognize all of the
   different ways that private information may be expressed through
   human written language.  If further protections are required,
   implementers may wish to consider establishing some sort of out-of-
   band arrangements between the relevant entities to contain private

   data as much as possible.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

Appendix A.  Example

   Assume the following input message:

     From: alice@example.com
     To: bob@example.net
     Subject: Make money fast!
     Message-ID: <123456789@mailer.example.com>
     Date: Thu, 17 Nov 2011 22:19:40 -0500

     Want to make a lot of money really fast?  Check it out!
     http://www.example.com/scam/0xd0d0cafe

   On receipt, bob@example.net reports this message as abusive through
   whatever mechanism his mailbox provider has established.  This causes
   an [ARF] message to be generated.  However, example.net wishes to

   obscure Bob's email address lest it be relayed to the offending
   agent, which could lead to more trouble for Bob.

   Thus, example.net plans to redact the local-part of the recipient
   address in the To: field.  It has selected a redaction key of
   "potatoes", and the private data in this case is the string "bob".
   The concatenation of "potatoesbob" is digested with SHA1 and then
   base64-encoded to the string "rZ8cqXWGiKHzhz1MsFRGTysHia4=".

   Thus, when constructing the ARF message in response to Bob's
   complaint, the following form of the received message is used in the
   third part of the ARF report:

     From: alice@example.com
     To: rZ8cqXWGiKHzhz1MsFRGTysHia4=@example.net
     Subject: Make money fast!
     Message-ID: <123456789@mailer.example.com>
     Date: Thu, 17 Nov 2011 22:19:40 -0500

     Want to make a lot of money really fast?  Check it out!
     http://www.example.com/scam/0xd0d0cafe

   Note, however, that it is possible the redacted information can be
   recovered by agents at example.com by searching their logs for the
   original envelope associated with the message by correlating with the
   Message-ID contents, which were not redacted here.  It is expected
   that feedback loops generating such reports involve senders that have
   been vetted against such information leakage.
