1.  Introduction

   This document specifies small extensions to the Home Agent
   Reliability protocol[ID-HARELIABILITY].  Local Mobility Anchor (LMA)
   acts as an anchor point in Proxy Mobile IPv6, while Home Agent (HA)
   is used in Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775].  Therefore, this specification aims
   to support LMA reliability for Proxy Mobile IPv6.  Since mobility
   managements are not handled by a mobile node, LMA failure and
   recovery must be fully transparent to the mobile node.  All the
   operations defined in this specification are completed between LMA
   and Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs).

   Figure 1 shows the network configuration of LMAs in a Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 domain.  LMA1' is a standby LMA for LMA1.  Besides the failure
   detection mechanism specified in [ID-HARELIABILITY], there exists
   other specific mechanism for LMA failure detection.  The detail
   description will be given in Section 3.  The Home Agent Reliability
   protocol has two different operational modes such as hard-switch and
   virtual-switch.  This specification also supports the two modes.  All
   the assumptions are same as [ID-HARELIABILITY] such as IPsec
   synchronization, same address configuration, etc.  For example, if
   LMAA1 and LMAA1' are same address, the operation can be virtual
   switch mode.  On the other hand, if they are different, it should be
   hard switch mode.  The detail operations will be given in Section 4
   and Section 5.  While the detail description of new mobility option
   and message will be given in Section 6.

2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   All terms in this document are defined in[RFC5213], [ID-HEARTBEAT]
   and [ID-HARELIABILITY].  In addition or in replacement of these, the
   following terms are defined or redefined:

   Current LMA

      A LMA that is currently serving the MAGs.  The LMA maybe still
      keep active when the tunnel between itself and MAG fail.


3.  LMA Failure Detection

   LMA Failure events used in the Local Mobility Anchor Reliability
   protocol are listed below.

Internet-Draft               LMA Reliability                 August 2009


   Detection Mechanism specified in   [ID-HARELIABILITY]

      Three mechanisms are defined in [ID-HARELIABILITY] such as Loss of
      HA-HELLO, Monitored Server Failure by the Active HA, Routing Peer/
      Link Failure.  Each LMA should exchange HA-HELLO for failure
      detection.

   Heartbeat Mechanism for Proxy Mobile IPv6   [ID-HEARTBEAT]

      In Proxy Mobile IPv6, both LMA and MAG should involve in detecting
      LMA failure.  Heartbeat mechanism specified in [ID-HEARTBEAT] can
      be used as an indication of LMA failure.  If a MAG detects LMA
      failure, it can solicit a standby LMA to recover the failed LMA.
      This solicitation can be sent only in the hard switch mode.  In
      the hard switch mode, MAG cannot reach to the standby LMA until
      the standby LMA completes taking over the failed LMA.  If a LMA
      detects the tunnel failure with one, some or all MAGs, it can
      treats this events as a hint of LMA failure.  However, the LMA
      SHOULD NOT start the failover as soon as it detects the failure
      events by using heartbeat mechanism.  It is because the heartbeat
      mechanism detects only the tunnel failure.  The tunnel failure
      might be caused by transport network failure or other reasons than
      LMA failure.


4.  LMA Virtual Switch Mode

   In the virtual switch mode, each LMA is configured with a same LMA
   address (LMAA).  A standby LMA MUST support the IPsec states
   synchronization functionality for this virtual switch mode.  As soon
   as LMA failure is detected, the standby LMA becomes active and takes
   over the failed LMA as defined in [ID-HARELIABILITY].


5.  LMA Hard Switch Mode

   In the hard switch mode, each LMA is configured with different LMA
   address (LMAA).  A standby LMA should creates security association
   with MAGs beforehand.  It can also establishes a tunnel with MAGs
   before LMA failure.

   In this case that LMA-HELLO mechanism is employed in LMA failure
   detection, the concrete procedure of LMA Hard Switch is similar to
   operation specified in [ID-HARELIABILITY].  As soon as LMA failure is
   detected, the standby LMA sends HA switch message to all the MAGs for
   which the failed LMA served as defined in [ID-HARELIABILITY].

   In this case that Heartbeat Mechanism defined in [ID-HEARTBEAT] is

Internet-Draft               LMA Reliability                 August 2009


   employed in LMA failure detection, MAG needs to actively involve in
   detecting LMA failure.  After a MAG establishes IPsec/IKE states with
   all the LMAs in the redundant LMA set beforehand, MAG needs to
   trigger heartbeat exchanges with each LMA respectively for checking
   peers reachability.  If the transport network between MAG and LMA
   corrupts than LMA failure, it may result in the loss of connectivity
   for MAG attached on LMA, however, the LMA is still active.  In this
   case, LMA-HELLO mechanism cannot detect the failure, and more further
   considerations are needed.

   The following subsections will only focus on the concrete solution to
   solve this problem of the tunnel failure.

5.1.  MAG Operation

   MAG needs to discover multiple LMA addresses, the discovery
   description is specified in [ID-LMADISCOVERY].  MAG authenticates
   itself to multiple LMAs and creates IPsec SAs with them as defined in
   [ID-HARELIABILITY].

   When MAG sends heartbeat request message to active LMA beyond
   MISSING_HEARTBEATS_ALLOWED amount without response, MAG concludes
   that current LMA is unreachable.  In this case, MAG indictates
   current LMA failure to a reachable standby LMA and solicits the
   standby LMA to takeover the current LMA.

   MAG initiates proxy binding update message to standby LMA with LMA
   failure indication.  Standby LMA MUST responds proxy binding
   aknowledge message until standby LMA completes taking over the
   current LMA.  The overview of operation is shown in Figure 2.

5.2.  LMA Operation

   If a MAG detects the tunnel failure with current LMA by heartbeat
   mechanism, it should solicit a standby LMA, with which MAG pre-
   establishes IPsec/IKE state, to recover the failed LMA.

   Usually the current LMA also can detect the tunnel failure by
   heartbeat mechanism.  However current LMA MUST NOT solicit standby
   LMA to takeover itself because the unreachability may be caused by
   MAG failure, and current LMA should not know whether the tunnel
   between MAG and standby LMA is active or not.

   Upon receiving PBU message from MAG with LMA failure indication,
   standby LMA MUST include proxy care-of address of MAG in SwitchOver
   Request Message as specified in section 6.3 to notify current LMA
   that packets of MAG will be routed to standby LMA instead of current
   LMA.  Whereas in this case, current LMA should not transit to standby
   state and still provide mobile service for other reachable MAGs.  At
   that time, two LMA are both available for different MAGs
   respectively.  More details are shown in Figure 3.

   be set to zero.

6.2.  LMA Failure Indication Mobility Option

   The LMA Reliability protocol extends this option in PBU message as an
   indication to standby LMA that MAG detect the tunnel failure and
   solicit standby LMA to takeover current LMA's role.  The LMA Failure
   Indication mobility option in the PBU MUST contain the IPv6 addresses
   of the current LMA.  The LMA Failure Indication mobility option in
   the PBU MAY contain the IPv4 addresses of the current LMA.

   The LMA Failure Indication mobility option has the alignment
   requirement of 4n+2.  There can zero or only one LMA Failure
   Indication mobility option in the PBU.  The format of the LMA Failure
   Indication mobility option is shown below:

      the IPv4 address of the current LMA.

6.3.  Home Agent Control Message

   The LMA Reliability protocol extends this message for the LMA Hard
   Switch.  When standby LMA receives PBU message from MAG with LMA
   failure indication, it MUST include proxy care-of address of MAG in
   MAG Address Option in SwitchOver Request Message (type field of Home
   Agent Control Message is 0) to notify current LMA that packets of MAG
   will be routed to standby LMA instead of current LMA from then on.

   If current LMA also detect the MAG unreachability by heartbeat
   exchange, current LMA should log the event and respond SwitchOver
   Reply Message (type field of Home Agent Control Message is 1) to
   standby LMA as soon as receiving SwitchOver Request Message from a
   standby LMA.  The response operation is same as [ID-HARELIABILITY].

   Type

      8-bit unsigned integer.  The type value MUST be 0 to indicate as
      SwitchOver Request Message.

   MAG Address

      The IPv6 or IPv4 address of MAG need to switch LMA, this field
      value is only valid for SwitchOver Request Message.  Standby LMA
      should take over all sessions of the MNs attached on the current
      MAG.

7.  IANA considerations

   A new option is used to synchronizing Proxy Binding Cache information
   of MAG in State Synchronization message between LMAs.  This option is
   specified in section 6.1.

   A new mobility option is used to indicate current LMA failure to
   standby LMA.  This option is specified in section 6.2.

   MAG Address Option is used to extend Home Agent Control Message
   defined in [ID-HARELIABILITY].  This option is specified in section
   6.3.


8.  Security Considerations

   No security vulnerability is introduced in this specification.  All
   the signaling are protected as described in [ID-HARELIABILITY] and in
   [RFC5213].
