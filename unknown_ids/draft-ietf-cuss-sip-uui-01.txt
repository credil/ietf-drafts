 A Mechanism for Transporting User to User Call Control Information in
                                  SIP
                       draft-ietf-cuss-sip-uui-01

Abstract

   There is a need for applications using SIP to exchange User to User
   Information (UUI) data during session establishment.  This
   information, known as call control UUI, is a small piece of data
   inserted by an application initiating the session, and utilized by an
   application accepting the session.  This data is opaque to SIP and
   its function is unrelated to any basic SIP function.  This document
   defines a new SIP header field, User-to-User, to transport UUI, along
   with an extension mechanism.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                    July 2011


1.  Overview

   This document describes the transport of User to User Information
   (UUI) using SIP [RFC3261].  Specifically, we discuss a mechanism for
   the transport of general application UUI and also for the transport
   of call control related ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information Element
   (UU IE) [Q931] and ITU-T Q.763 User to User Information Parameter
   [Q763] data in SIP.  UUI is widely used in the PSTN today in contact
   centers and call centers which are transitioning away from ISDN to
   SIP.  This extension will also be used for native SIP endpoints
   implementing similar services and interworking with ISDN services.

   This mechanism was designed to meet the use cases, requirements, and
   call flows for SIP call control UUI detailed in
   [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].  All references to requirement numbers
   (REQ-N) and figure numbers refer to this document.

   The mechanism chosen is a new SIP header field, along with a new SIP
   option tag and media feature tag.  The header field carries the UUI
   information, along with parameters indicating the encoding of the
   UUI, the application user of the UUI, and optionally the content of
   the UUI.  The header field can be escaped into URIs supporting
   referral and redirection scenarios.  In these scenarios, History-Info
   is used to indicate the inserter of the UUI.  The SIP option tag is
   used to indicate support for the header field.  Support for the
   header field indicates that a UA is able to extract the information
   in the UUI and pass it up the protocol stack.  The media feature tag
   is used to indicate that a UA supports a particular application user
   of UUI.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements Discussion

   This section describes how the User-to-User header field meets the
   requirements in [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].  The header field can
   be included in INVITE requests and responses and BYE requests and
   responses, meeting REQ-1 and REQ-2.

   For redirection and referral use cases and REQ-3, the header field
   would be escaped into the Contact or Refer-To URI.  Currently, UAs



Johnston & Rafferty     Expires January 12, 2012                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                    July 2011


   that support attended transfer support the ability to escape a
   Replaces header field into a Refer-To URI, and when acting upon this
   URI add the Replaces header field to the triggered INVITE.  This
   logic and behavior is identical for the UUI header field.  The UA
   processing the REFER or the 3xx to the INVITE will need to support
   the UUI mechanism, as UAs in general do not process unknown escaped
   header fields.

   Since SIP proxy forwarding and retargeting does not affect header
   fields, the header field meets REQ-4.

   The UUI header field will carry the UUI data and not a pointer to the
   data, so REQ-5 is met.

   Since the basic design of the UUI header field is similar to the ISDN
   UUI service, interworking with PSTN protocols will be straightforward
   and will be documented in a separate specification, meeting REQ-6

   Requirements REQ-7, REQ-8, and REQ-10 relate to discovery of the
   mechanism and supported applications.  REQ-7 relates to support of
   the UUI header field, while REQ-8 relates to routing based on support
   of the UUI header field.  REQ-7 is met by defining a new SIP option
   tag 'uui'.  The use of a 'Require: uui' in a request, or 'Supported:
   uui' in an OPTIONS response could be used to require or discover
   support of the mechanism.  The presence of a Supported:uui or
   Require:uui header field can be used by proxies to route to an
   appropriate UA, meeting REQ-8.  REQ-10 is met by creating a new class
   of SIP feature tags.  For example, the feature tag 'sip.uui.isdn'
   could be used to indicate support of the ISDN UUI service, or
   'sip.uui.app1' could be used to indicate support for a particular
   application, app1.

   Proxies commonly apply policy to the presence of certain SIP header
   fields in requests by either passing them or removing them from
   requests.  REQ-9 is met by allowing proxies and other intermediaries
   to remove UUI header fields in a request or response based on policy.

   Carrying UUI data elements of at least 129 octets is trivial in the
   UUI header field, meeting REQ-11.  Note that very large UUI elements
   should be avoided, as SIP header fields have traditionally not been
   large.

   To meet REQ-12 in redirection and referral use cases, History-Info
   [I-D.ietf-sipcore-rfc4244bis] can be used.  In these retargeting
   cases, the changed Request-URI will be recorded in the History-Info
   header field along with the identity of the element that performed
   the retargeting.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                    July 2011


   The requirement for integrity protection in REQ-13 could be met by
   the use of an S/MIME signature over a subset of header fields, as
   defined in Section 23.4 of RFC 3261 "SIP Header Privacy and Integrity
   using S/MIME: Tunneling SIP".  The requirement of REQ-14 for end-to-
   end privacy could be met using S/MIME or using encryption at the
   application layer.  Note that the use of S/MIME to secure the UUI
   will result in an additional body being added to the request.
   Hopwise TLS allows the header field to meet REQ-15 for hop-by-hop
   security.


4.  Normative Definition

   This document defines a new SIP header field "User-to-User" to
   transport call control UUI to meet the requirements in
   [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].

   To help tag and identify the UUI used with this header field, "app",
   "content", and "encoding" parameters are defined.  The "app"
   parameter identifies the application which generates and consumes the
   UUI information.  For the case of interworking with the ISDN UUI
   Service, the application is unknown, so a value to indicate ISDN UUI
   Service interworking will be defined.  If the "app" parameter is not
   present, interworking with the ISDN UUI Service MUST be assumed.  The
   "content" parameter identifies the actual content of the UUI data.
   If not present, the content MUST be assumed to be unknown as it is in
   the ISDN UUI Service.  For newly defined applications using the SIP
   UUI service, a "content" value MUST be defined and SHOULD be used.
   The "encoding" parameter indicates the method of encoding the
   information in the UUI.  This specification only defines
   "encoding=hex".  If the "encoding" parameter is not present, "hex"
   MUST be assumed.

4.1.  Syntax for UUI Header Field

   The User-to-User header field can be present in INVITE requests and
   responses only and in BYE requests and responses.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC 2234 and extends RFC 3261.

        UUI         = "User-to-User" HCOLON uui-data *(SEMI uui-param)
        uui-data    = token
        uui-param   = enc-param | cont-param | app-param | generic-param
        enc-param   = "encoding="("hex" | token)
        cont-param  = "content=" token
        app-param   = "app=" token

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                    July 2011


   User-to-User header fields with different "app" parameters MAY be
   present in a request or response.  The number of User-to-User header
   fields which may be present in a request or response is defined for a
   particular application.  Any size limitations on the UUI for a
   particular purpose must be defined by that application.

4.2.  Definition of New Parameter Values

   This specification defines only the value of "hex" for the "encoding"
   parameter.  New values can be defined and added to the IANA registry
   with a standards track RFC, which needs to discuss the issues in this
   section.

   New "encoding" values must reference a common encoding scheme or
   define the exact new encoding scheme.

   New "content" values must describe the content of the UUI and give
   some example use cases.  The default "encoding" and other allowed
   encoding methods must be defined for this new content.

   New "app" values must describe the new application which is utilizing
   the UUI data and give some example use cases.  The default "content"
   value and other allowed contents must be defined for this new
   purpose.  Any restrictions on the size of the UUI data must be
   described for the new application.


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Registration of Header Field

   This document defines a new SIP header field named "User-to-User".

   The following row shall be added to the "Header Fields" section of
   the SIP parameter registry:


                 +------------------+--------------+-----------+
                 | Header Name      | Compact Form | Reference |
                 +------------------+--------------+-----------+
                 | User-to-User     |              | [RFCXXXX] |
                 +------------------+--------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   this document.

5.2.  Registration of Header Field Parameters

   This document defines the parameters for the header field defined in
   the preceding section.  The header field "User-to-User" can contain
   the parameters "encoding", "content", and "purpose".

   The following rows shall be added to the "Header Field Parameters and
   Parameter Values" section of the SIP parameter registry:


   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
   | Header Field     | Parameter Name | Predefined Values | Reference |
   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
   | User-to-User     | encoding       | hex               | [RFCXXXX] |
   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   this document.

5.3.  Registration of SIP Option Tag

   This specification registers a new SIP option tag, as per the
   guidelines in Section 27.1 of [RFC3261].

   This document defines the SIP option tag "uui".

   The following row has been added to the "Option Tags" section of the
   SIP Parameter Registry:

   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | Name       | Description                              | Reference |
   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | uui        | This option tag is used to indicate that | [RFCXXXX] |
   |            | a UA supports and understands the        |           |
   |            | User-to-User header field.               |           |
   +------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   this document.

   Registration of SIP media feature tag is TBD.


6.  Security Considerations

   User to user information can potentially carry sensitive information
   that might require privacy or integrity protection.  Standard
   deployed SIP security mechanisms such as TLS transport, offer these



Johnston & Rafferty     Expires January 12, 2012                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                    July 2011


   properties on a hop-by-hop basis.  To preserve multi-hop or end-to-
   end confidentiality and integrity of UUI, approaches using S/MIME can
   be used, as discussed in the draft.  However, the lack of deployment
   of these mechanisms means that applications can not in general rely
   on them.  As such, applications are encouraged to utilize their own
   security mechanisms.


7.  Appendix - Other Possible Mechanisms

   Two other possible mechanisms for transporting UUI will be described:
   MIME body and URI parameter transport.

7.1.  Why INFO is Not Used

   Since the INFO method [RFC2976], was developed for ISUP interworking
   of user-to-user information, it might seem to be the logical choice
   here.  For non-call control user-to-user information, INFO can be
   utilized for end to end transport.  However, for transport of call
   control user-to-user information, INFO can not be used.  As the call
   flows in [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs] show, the information is
   related to an attempt to establish a session and must be passed with
   the session setup request (INVITE), responses to that INVITE, or
   session termination requests.  As a result, it is not possible to use
   INFO in these cases.

7.2.  Why Other Protocol Encapsulation UUI Mechanisms are Not Used

   Other protocols have the ability to transport UUI information.  For
   example, consider the ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information Element
   (UU IE) [Q931] and the ITU-T Q.763 User to User Information Parameter
   [Q763].  In addition, NSS (Narrowband Signaling System) [Q1980] is
   also able to transport UUI information.  Should one of these
   protocols be in use, and present in both User Agents, then utilizing
   these other protocols to transport UUI might be a logical solution.
   Essentially, this is just adding an additional layer in the protocol
   stack.  In these cases, SIP is not transporting the UUI; it is
   encapsulating another protocol, and that protocol is transporting the
   UUI.  Once a mechanism to transport that other protocol using SIP
   exists, the UUI transport function is essentially obtained without
   any additional effort or work.

   However, the authors believe that SIP needs to have its own native
   UUI transport mechanism.  It is not reasonable for a SIP UA to have
   to implement another entire protocol (either ISDN or NSS, for
   example) just to get the very simple UUI transport service.  Of
   course, this work does not preclude anyone from using other protocols
   with SIP to transport UUI information.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                    July 2011


7.3.  MIME body Approach

   One method of transport is to use a MIME body.  This is in keeping
   with the SIP-T architecture [RFC3372] in which MIME bodies are used
   to transport ISUP information.  Since the INVITE will normally have
   an SDP message body, the resulting INVITE with SDP and UUI will be
   multipart MIME.  This is not ideal as many SIP UAs do not support
   multipart MIME INVITEs.

   A bigger problem is the insertion of a UUI message body by a redirect
   server or in a REFER.  The body would need to be encoded in the
   Contact URI of the 3xx response or the Refer-To URI of a REFER.
   Currently, the authors are not aware of any UAs that support this
   capability today for any body type.  As such, the complete set of
   semantics for this operation would need to be determined and defined.
   Some issues will need to be resolved, such as, do all the Content-*
   header fields have to be escaped as well?  And, what if the escaped
   Content-Length does not agree with the escaped body?

   Since proxies cannot remove a body from a request or response, it is
   not at all clear how this mechanism could meet REQ-9.

   The requirement for integrity protection could be met by the use of
   an S/MIME signature over the body, as defined in Section 23.3 of RFC
   3261 "Securing MIME bodies".  Alternatively, this could be achieved
   using RFC 4474 [RFC4474].  The requirement for end-to-end privacy
   could be met using S/MIME encryption or using encryption at the
   application layer.  However, note that neither S/MIME or RFC 4474
   enjoys deployment in SIP today.

   An example:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?Content-Type=
   application/uui&body=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
   </allOneLine>

   Note that the <allOneLine> tag convention from SIP  Torture Test
   Messages [RFC4475] is used to show that there are no line breaks in
   the actual message syntax.

   As such, the MIME body approach meets REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-4, REQ-5,
   REQ-7, REQ-11, REQ-13, and REQ-14.  Meeting REQ-12 seems possible,
   although the authors do not have a specific mechanism to propose.
   Meeting REQ-3 is problematic, but not impossible for this mechanism.
   However, this mechanism does not seem to be able to meet REQ-9.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                    July 2011


7.4.  URI Parameter

   Another proposed approach is to encode the UUI as a URI parameter.
   This UUI parameter could be included in a Request-URI or in the
   Contact URI or Refer-To URI.  It is not clear how it could be
   transported in a responses which does not have a Request-URI, or in
   BYE requests or responses.

  <allOneLine>
  Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com;uui=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6
  F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
  </allOneLine>

   An INVITE sent to this Contact URI would contain UUI in the Request-
   URI of the INVITE.  The URI parameter has a drawback in that a URI
   parameter carried in a Request-URI will not survive retargeting by a
   proxy as shown in Figure 2 of [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs].  That is,
   if the URI is included with an Address of Record instead of a Contact
   URI, the URI parameter in the Reqeuest-URI will not be copied over to
   the Contact URI, resulting in the loss of the information.  Note that
   if this same URI was present in a Refer-To header field, the same
   loss of information would occur.

   The URI parameter approach would meet REQ-3, REQ-5, REQ-7, REQ-9, and
   REQ-11.  It is possible the approach could meet REQ-12 and REQ-13.
   The mechanism does not appear to meet REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-4, and
   REQ-14.
