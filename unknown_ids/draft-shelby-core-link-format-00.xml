    <t>
	This document defines a link format for use by constrained CoAP web servers to describe URIs of resources offered along with other attributes. Based on the HTTP Link Header format, the CoRE link format is carried as a payload and is assigned an Internet media type. A well-known URI is defined as a default entry-point for requesting the list of links to resources hosted by a server.

  <section anchor='introduction' title="Introduction">

  <t>
  The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) working group aims at realizing the REST architecture in a suitable form for the most constrained nodes (e.g. 8-bit microcontrollers with limited RAM and ROM) and networks (e.g. 6LoWPAN). CoRE is aimed at machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation <xref target="I-D.shelby-core-coap-req"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
  The discovery of resources offered by a constrained server is very important in machine-to-machine applications where there are no humans in the loop and static interfaces result in fragility. The discovery of resources provided by an HTTP Web Server is typically called Web Discovery. In this document we refer to the discovery of resources offered by a CoAP server as resource discovery.
  </t>
  <t>
  The core function of such a discovery mechanism is to provide URIs ("links") for the resources offered, complemented by information describing the relationship between the resource description and each resource as well as other attributes.  When such a collection of attributed resource references (links) is offered as a resource of its own (as opposed to as HTTP headers delivered with a different resource), we speak of its representation as a link-format.
  </t>
  <t>
  This document specifies a link-format for use in CoRE resource discovery by extending the HTTP Link Header Format <xref target="I-D.nottingham-http-link-header"/> to describe resources hosted by a constrained server. The CoRE link-format is carried as a payload and is assigned an Internet media type. A well-known URI "/.well-known/core" is defined as a default entry-point for requesting the list of links to resources hosted by a server.

  <section anchor='format' title="Link Format">

    <t>
    CoRE resource discovery extends the HTTP Link Header format specified in <xref target="I-D.nottingham-http-link-header"/> which is specified in Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation <xref target="RFC5234"/>. The format does not require special XML or binary parsing, and is extensible. 
    </t>
    <t>
    This link format is used for a similar purpose to that described in <xref target="I-D.nottingham-http-link-header"/>, to describe one or more relationships between resources. However in this specification the link format is extended with specific constrained M2M link parameters, links are carried as a payload rather than in a message header, and a default interface is defined to discover resources described by these links. 
    </t>
    <t>
    <xref target="I-D.nottingham-http-link-header"/> did not require an Internet media type for this link format, as it assumes to be carried in an HTTP header. This specification thus requests a Internet media type for this format (see <xref target="iana-mime"/>).
    </t>
    <t>    
    The CoRE link format uses the ABNF description and associated rules in Section 5 of <xref target="I-D.nottingham-http-link-header"/>. The "Link:" text is omitted as that is part of the HTTP Link Header.   
    Multiple link descriptions are separated by commas. The CoRE link format MUST use the US-ASCII character set (support for RFC2231 encoding of non-ASCII content TBD). The following CoRE specific link-extension parameters to the format are defined:
    </t>

       <figure>
         <artwork><![CDATA[

   link-extension    = ( "d" "=" URI )
   link-extension    = ( "sh" "=" URI-Reference )
   link-extension    = ( "n" "=" ( quoted-string | URI ) )
   link-extension    = ( "ct" "=" integer ) 
   link-extension    = ( "id" "=" ( quoted-string | URI ) )

         ]]></artwork>
       </figure>

	<section title="Target and context IRIs">
	
	 	 <t>
         Each link description conveys one target URI as a URI-Reference inside angle brackets ("<>"). The context of a link conveyed in the description is by default the URI of the resource that returned the link-format representation (usually ./well-known/core). Thus each link can be thought of as describing a target resource hosted by the server in the absence of further relation information. This is an important difference to the way the HTTP Link Header format is used, as it is included in the header of an HTTP response for some URI (this URI is by default the context). Thus the HTTP Link Header is by default relating the target URI to the URI that was requested. In comparison, the CoRE link format includes one or more link entries, each describing a resource hosted by a server.
         </t>
         <t>
         As per Section 5.2 of <xref target="I-D.nottingham-http-link-header"/> a link description MAY include an "anchor" attribute, in which case the context is the URI included in that attribute. This can be used to describe a relationship between two resources. A consuming implementation can however choose to ignore such links. It is not expected that most implementations will be able to derive useful from explicitly anchored links.
         </t>
	
	</section>

	<section title="Link relation 'rel' usage">
	
	 	 <t>
         Link descriptions in CoRE are typically used to describe entry points to services hosted by the server, and thus in the absence of the rel attribute the registered "service" relation type is assumed. In the CoRE link format the service relation type indicates that the link is a service hosted by the server (in the absence of the anchor attribute). A description can make use of any registered relation type or extension types in the form of a URI by including the rel attribute. </t>
	
	</section>


	<section title="Description 'd' usage">
	
	 	 <t>
	 	 The description "d" attribute can provide a URI to a specific interface definition used to access the target resource. This could be for example a URI to the WADL definition of the target resource. Multiple description attributes MAY appear in a link description.
         </t>
	
	</section>
	
	<section title="Alternative URI 'sh' usage">
	
	 	 <t>
	 	 This attribute can be included to define an alternative short URI which can also be used to access the target resource. Multiple alternative short URI attributes MAY appear in a link description.
         </t>
	
	</section>

	<section title="Resource name 'n' usage">
	
	 	 <t>
	 	 The resource name "n" attribute is used to assign eith a human readable or a semantically important name to a resource. In the case of a temperature sensor resource the name could be something like "Temperature in Centigrade", a URI to an ontology like "http://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov/2.0/phys.owl#Temperature" or an application-specific semantic name like "TemperatureC". Multiple name attributes MAY appear in a link description.
         </t>
	
	</section>

	<section title="Content-type code 'ct' usage">
	
	 	 <t>
	 	 The Content-type code "ct" attribute provides a hint about the Internet media type this resource returns. The value is in the CoAP identifier code format as a decimal ASCII integer <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/>. For example application/xml would be indicated as "ct=41". If no Content-type code attribute is present then text/plain is assumed. The Content-type code attribute MUST NOT appear more than once in a link description.
         </t>
         <t>
         Alternatively, the "type" attribute MAY be used to indicate an Internet media type as a quoted-string. It is not however expected that constrained implementations are able to parse quoted-string Content-type values.
         </t>
	
	</section>
	
	<section title="Resource identifier 'id' usage">
	
	 	 <t>
	 	 The resource identifier "id" field is a unique identifier (e.g. UUID) for this resource for use in e.g. resource or search directories. This attribute may be in quoted-string format (e.g. in the case of a UUID or XRI) or in URI format (e.g. in the case of a URN). The resource identifier attribute MUST NOT appear more than once in a link description.
         </t>
	
	</section>

  <section anchor='examples' title="Examples">

  <t>
  A few examples of typical link descriptions in this format follows. Multiple resource descriptions in a representation are separated by commas. Commas can also occur in quoted strings and URIs but do not end a description. Linefeeds never occur in the actual format, but are shown in the example for readability. </t>

  <t>This example includes link descriptions for an index to sensors hosted by a server, along with links two two different sensors.</t>

  <section anchor='well-known' title="Well-known Interface">

  <t>
  Resource discovery in CoRE is accomplished through the use of a well-known resource URI which returns a list of links (resource descriptions) offered by that constrained server. Well-known resources have a reserved base URI "/.well-known/" as specified in <xref target="RFC5785"/>.  This document defines a new well-known URI for CoRE discovery "/.well-known/core" <xref target="iana-well-known"/>. A server implementing this specification MUST support this URI on the default port appropriate for the protocol, for the purpose of resource discovery. It is however up to the application which link descriptions are included and how they are organized. In the absense of any links, a zero-length payload is returned. The resource representation of this resource is described in <xref target="format"/>. 
  </t>
  <t>
  The CoRE resource discovery interface supports the following interactions:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>Performing a GET on /.well-known/core to the default port returns a list of link descriptions available from a CoAP server (if any). </t>
      
      <t>Filtering may be performed on any of the link format attributes using a query string as specified in <xref target="filtering"/>. For example [GET /.well-known/core?n=TemperatureC] would request resources with the name TemperatureC. A server is not however required to support filtering.
      </t>
      
      <t>More capable servers such as proxies could support a resource directory by requesting the resource descriptions of other end-points or accepting [POST /.well-known/core messages] from other servers. This adds the resources of other end-points as a sub-resource in which absolute URIs are included for the link-values. The details of such resource directory functionality is however out of scope for this document.</t>

    </list>
  </t>
  <t>
  End-points with a large number of resources SHOULD include resource descriptions only for important services or collections and organize their resource descriptions into a hierarchy of link resources. This is done by including links in the /.well-known/core list which point to other resource lists, e.g. <![CDATA[</.well-known/core/sensors>]]>. Such a hierarchy SHOULD be under the /.well-known/core path but could be located elsewhere.
  </t>

  <section anchor='filtering' title="Query Filtering">
	<t>
	A server implementing this document MAY support the query string /.well-known/core? with uri= corresponding to the link-value or any of the resource description attributes for the purpose of filtering a discovery. It is not expected that simple implementations support filtering, but instead will just ignore the query string. Wildcard * endings MAY be supported. An exact match is performed on the query string, and a 200 OK response is returned with link descriptions that contains the matching entries (if any). If resource descriptions are organized hierarchically, a query on the root resource /.well-known/core SHOULD return all matching resource descriptions from the entire hierarchy. An example query on the example link descriptions from <xref target="format"/> may look like:
