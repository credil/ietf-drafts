    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The defining characteristics of Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs)
      offer unique challenges to a routing solution. The IETF ROLL Working
      Group has defined application-specific routing requirements for a Low
      Power and Lossy Network (LLN) routing protocol <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs"></xref> <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs"></xref> <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-roll-indus-routing-reqs"></xref> <xref
      target="RFC5548"></xref>. RPL is a new routing protocol designed to meet
      these requirements.</t>

      <section title="Design Principles">
        <t>RPL was designed with the objective to meet the requirements
        spelled out in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs"></xref>, <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs"></xref>, <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-roll-indus-routing-reqs"></xref>, and <xref
        target="RFC5548"></xref>. Because those requirements are heterogeneous
        and sometimes incompatible in nature, the approach is first taken to
        design a protocol capable of supporting a core set of functionalities
        corresponding to the intersection of the requirements. (Note: it is
        intended that as this design evolves optional features may be added to
        address some application specific requirements). All "MUST"
        application requirements that cannot be satisfied by RPL will be
        specifically listed in the Appendix A, accompanied by a
        justification.</t>

        <t>The core set of functionalities is to be capable of operating in
        the most severely constrained environments, with minimal requirements
        for memory, energy, processing, communication, and other consumption
        of limited resources from nodes. Trade-offs inherent in the
        provisioning of protocol features will be exposed to the implementer
        in the form of configurable parameters, such that the implementer can
        further tweak and optimize the operation of RPL as appropriate to a
        specific application and implementation. Finally, RPL is designed to
        consult implementation specific policies to determine, for example,
        the evaluation of routing metrics.</t>

        <t>A set of companion documents to this specification will provide
        further guidance in the form of applicability statements specifying a
        set of operating points appropriate to the Building Automation, Home
        Automation, Industrial, and Urban application scenarios.</t>

    <section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>The terminology used in this document is consistent with and
      incorporates that described in `Terminology in Low power And Lossy
      Networks' <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-terminology"></xref>. The
      terminology is extended in this document as follows:</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Autonomous:">Refers to the ability of a routing
          protocol to independently function without requiring any external
          influence or guidance. Includes self-organization capabilities.</t>

          <t hangText="DAG:">Directed Acyclic Graph- A directed graph having
          the property that all edges are oriented in such a way that no
          cycles exist. In the RPL context, all edges are contained in paths
          oriented toward and terminating at a root node (a DAG root, or sink-
          typically a LBR).</t>

          <t hangText="DAGID:">DAG Identifier- A globally unique identifier
          for a DAG. All nodes who are members of a DAG have knowledge of the
          DAGID. This knowledge is used to identify peer nodes within the DAG
          in order to coordinate DAG Maintenance while avoiding loops.</t>

          <t hangText="DAG Parent:">A parent of a node within a DAG is one of
          the immediate successors of the node on a path towards the DAG root.
          For each DAGID that a node is a member of, the node will maintain a
          set containing one or more DAG Parents. If a node is a member of
          multiple DAGs then it must conceptually maintain a set of DAG
          Parents for each DAGID.</t>

          <t hangText="DAG Sibling:">A sibling of a node within a DAG is
          defined to be any neighboring node which is located at the same
          depth, or rank, within a DAG. Note that siblings defined in this
          manner do not necessarily share a common parent. For each DAGID that
          a node is a member of, the node will maintain a set of DAG Siblings.
          If a node is a member of multiple DAGs then it must conceptually
          maintain a set of DAG Siblings for each DAGID.</t>

          <t hangText="DAG Root:">A DAG root is a sink within the DAG graph.
          All paths in the DAG terminate at a DAG root, and all DAG edges
          contained in the paths terminating at a DAG root are oriented toward
          the DAG root. There must be at least one DAG Root per DAGID, and in
          some cases there may be more than one. In many use cases,
          source-sink represents a dominant traffic flow, where the sink is a
          DAG root. Maintaining default routing towards DAG roots is therefore
          a prominent functionality for RPL.</t>

          <t hangText="Grounded:">A DAG is grounded if it contains a DAG Root
          offering a default route.</t>

          <t hangText="Floating:">A DAG is floating if it contains a DAG root
          that does not offer a default route.</t>

          <t hangText="Inward:">In the context of RPL, inward refers to the
          direction from leaf nodes towards DAG roots, following the
          orientation of the edges within the DAG.</t>

          <t hangText="Outward:">In the context of RPL, outward refers to the
          direction from DAG roots towards leaf nodes, going against the
          orientation of the edges within the DAG.</t>

          <t hangText="P2P:">Point-to-point. This refers to traffic exchanged
          between two nodes.</t>

          <t hangText="P2MP:">Point-to-Multipoint. This refers to traffic
          between one node and a set of nodes. This is similar to the P2MP
          concept in Multicast or MPLS Traffic Engineering (<xref
          target="RFC4461"></xref> and <xref target="RFC4875"></xref>).</t>

          <t hangText="MP2P:">Multipoint-to-Point; used to describe a
          particular traffic pattern. A common RPL use case involves MP2P
          flows collecting information from many nodes in the DAG, flowing
          inwards towards DAG roots. Note that a DAG root may not be the
          ultimate destination of the information, but it is a common transit
          node.</t>

          <t hangText="OCP:">Objective Code Point. In RPL, the Objective Code
          Point (OCP) indicates which routing metrics, optimization
          objectives, and related functions are in use in a DAG. It is
          recommended that a companion document define instances of the
          Objective Code Point and request the creation of a registry to
          manage them.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Note that in this document, the terms `node' and `LLN router' are
      used interchangeably.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="ProtocolModel" title="Protocol Model">
      <t>The aim of this section is to describe RPL in the spirit of <xref
      target="RFC4101"></xref>. An architectural protocol overview (the big
      picture of the protocol) is provided in this section. Protocol details
      can be found in further sections.</t>

      <section title="Problem">
        <t>Some well-defined LLN application-specific scenarios are Building
        Automation, Home Automation, Industrial, and Urban; for which the
        unique routing requirements have been detailed respectively in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs"></xref>, <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs"></xref>, <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-roll-indus-routing-reqs"></xref>, and <xref
        target="RFC5548"></xref>. Within these application-specific scenarios
        there are some common elements required of routing. RPL intends to
        address the requirements of these application-specific scenarios, and
        it is further intended to be flexible enough to extend to other
        application scenarios.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Protocol Properties Overview">
        <t>RPL demonstrates the following properties, consistent with the
        requirements specified by the requirements documents.</t>

        <section title="IPv6 Architecture">
          <t>RPL is strictly compliant with layered IPv6 architecture.</t>

          <t>Further, RPL is designed with consideration to the practical
          support and implementation of IPv6 architecture on devices which may
          operate under severe resource constraints, including but not limited
          to memory, processing power, energy, and communication. The RPL
          design does not presume high quality reliable links, and should be
          able to operate over lossy links (usually low bandwidth with low
          packet delivery success rate).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Path Properties for LLN Traffic Flows">
          <t>Multipoint-to-point (MP2P) and Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) traffic
          flows from nodes within the LLN from and to egress points are very
          common in LLNs. Low power and lossy network Border Router (LBR)
          nodes may typically be at the root of such flows, although such
          flows are not exclusively rooted at LBRs as determined on an
          application-specific basis.</t>

          <t>As required by the aforementioned routing requirements documents,
          RPL supports the installation of multiple paths. The use of multiple
          paths include sending duplicated traffic along diverse paths, as
          well as to support advanced features such as Class of Service (CoS)
          based routing, or simple load balancing among a set of paths (which
          could be useful for the LLN to spread traffic load and avoid fast
          energy depletion on some nodes).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Constraint Based Routing">
          <t>The RPL design supports constraint based routing, based on a set
          of routing metrics. The routing metrics supported by RPL are
          specified in a companion document to this specification, <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics"></xref>. RPL signals the
          metrics and related objective functions in use in a particular
          implementation by means of an Objective Code Point (OCP).</t>

          <t>RPL supports the computation and installation of different paths
          in support of and optimized for a set of application and
          implementation specific constraints, as guided by an OCP. Traffic
          may subsequently be directed along the appropriate constrained path
          based on traffic marking within the IPv6 header. For more details on
          the approach towards constraint-based routing, see <xref
          target="ConstrainedLLNs"></xref>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Autonomous Operation">
          <t>Nodes running RPL are able to independently and autonomously
          discover a network topology and compute and install routes, without
          requiring further administrative interaction.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Protocol Operation">
        <t>LLN nodes running RPL will construct Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
        rooted at designated nodes that generally provide default routes. The
        DAG is sufficient to support inward MP2P traffic flows, flowing inward
        along the LLN towards a sink (DAG Root), which is one of the dominant
        traffic flows described in the requirements documents (<xref
        target="I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs"></xref>, <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs"></xref>, <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-roll-indus-routing-reqs"></xref>, and <xref
        target="RFC5548"></xref>).</t>

        <t>By utilizing a DAG for dominant MP2P flows, RPL allows each node to
        select and maintain potentially multiple successors capable of
        forwarding traffic inwards towards the root. The DAG does not present
        as many single points of failure as a tree, and in addition can offer
        a node a set of pre-computed successors in support of, e.g. local
        route repair in case of a temporary failure, load balancing, or short
        term fluctuations in link characteristics.</t>

        <t>A DAG also serves to restrict the routing problem on the nodes when
        it is used as a reference topology. This allows nodes to determine
        their positions in a DAG relative to each other and provides a means
        to coordinate route repair in a way that endeavors to avoid loops.
        These mechanisms will be described in more detail later in this
        specification.</t>

        <t>As DAGs are organized, RPL will use a Destination Advertisement
        mechanism to build up routing state in support of outward P2MP traffic
        flows. This mechanism, using the DAG as a reference, `paints' the
        underlying LLN graph, guided along the DAG, such that the routes
        toward destination prefixes in the outward direction may be set up. As
        the DAG undergoes modification during DAG maintenance, the Destination
        Advertisement mechanism can be triggered to update the outward routing
        state.</t>

        <t>Arbitrary P2P traffic MAY flow inward along the DAG until a common
        parent is reached who has stored routing state and is capable of
        directing the traffic outward along the correct outward path. In the
        present specification RPL does not specify nor preclude any additional
        mechanisms that may be capable to compute and install more optimal
        routes into LLN nodes in support of arbitrary P2P traffic. (Note that
        in some application scenarios it may be important to support arbitrary
        P2P traffic along more optimal paths `across' the DAG). This
        functionality is to be investigated further in a future revision.</t>

        <t>This section further describes the high level operation of RPL.</t>

        <section title="DAG Construction">
          <section title="Overview of a Typical Case">
            <t>RPL constructs one or more base routing topologies, in the form
            of DAGs, over gradients defined by optimizing cost metrics along
            paths rooted at designated nodes.</t>

            <t>DAGs may be grounded, in which case the DAG Root is offering a
            default route. A typical goal for a node participating in DAG
            Construction will be to find and join a grounded DAG.</t>

            <t>In the context of a particular LLN application one or more
            nodes will be capable of offering a default route and thus be
            provisioned to act as DAG roots. These nodes will begin the
            process of constructing a grounded DAG by occasionally emitting
            Router Advertisements containing the necessary information for
            neighboring nodes to evaluate the DAG Root as a potential DAG
            parent. This information will include a DAGID and an Objective
            Code Point (OCP). The OCP provides information as to which metrics
            and optimization goals are being employed across the DAG. Note
            that a single DAG Root may conceptually root different DAGs with
            different OCPs as required to support different sets of routing
            constraints. Note that if multiple DAG roots are rooting the same
            DAG, i.e. presenting the same DAGID, then they must have some
            means of coordinating with each other when emitting Router
            Advertisements. This is described further below.</t>

            <t>Nodes who hear Router Advertisements, advertising a specific
            DAGID and OCP, will take into consideration several criteria when
            processing the extracted DAG information. A node may seek a DAG
            advertising a specific OCP, reflecting the implementation specific
            routing constraints understood by the node. In particular, a node
            will be seeking to find a least cost path satisfying some
            objective function as indicated by the OCP according to some
            routing metrics defined in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics"></xref>. For example, the
            least cost path may be determined in part by minimizing energy
            along a path, or latency, or avoiding the use of battery powered
            nodes. Based on the evaluation of such criteria, a node may
            determine if the node who emitted the Router Advertisement should
            be considered as a potential DAG parent. If so, then the node may
            add the advertising node to its set of DAG parents for the
            advertised DAGID, and can be considered to have joined the DAG
            designated by DAGID.</t>

            <t>When a node adds the first DAG parent to the set of DAG parents
            for a particular DAGID, the node is said to have joined, or
            attached to, the DAG designated by DAGID. Adding additional DAG
            parents beyond the first simply increases path diversity inwards
            toward the DAG root. When a node removes the last DAG Parent from
            the set of DAG parents for a particular DAGID, the node is said to
            have left, or detached from, the DAG designated by DAGID. RPL will
            coordinate the joining, leaving, and movement of nodes within a
            DAGID in such a way so as to avoid the formation of loops, as
            described further below.</t>

            <t>As nodes join the DAG they are able advertise the fact by
            beginning to multicast the DAG information in Router
            Advertisements. In this way, nodes are able to join the DAG at
            ever-increasing depths outward from the DAG root. As nodes
            continue to receive DAG multicasts they may continue to expand
            their set of DAG parents, while employing loop avoidance
            strategies as describe below, in order to build path diversity
            inwards toward the DAG root.</t>

            <t>Using the information conveyed in the metrics of its most
            preferred DAG parent, its own metrics, and the conventions and
            functions indicated by the OCP, a node is able to compute a depth
            value within the DAG which it will use to coordinate its DAG
            maintenance.</t>

            <t>In addition to identifying DAG parents, a node also may hear
            the Router Advertisements of other neighboring nodes at the same
            depth within the DAG. In this way a node can discover DAG
            Siblings.</t>

            <t>A node may order its set of DAG parents according to some
            implementation specific preference. To this list the node may also
            append a similarly ordered set of DAG siblings. By forwarding
            traffic intended for the default destination towards the DAG
            parents, the node is able to support the main Multipoint-to-point
            (MP2P) traffic flows required by a typical LLN application. By
            using the ordered set of DAG parents and DAG siblings the node is
            able to take advantage of path diversity. For example, preferring
            to forward traffic towards parents guarantees to get the traffic
            inwards, closer to the DAG root, by definition, regardless of
            which parent is selected. In this example, if forwarding towards
            parents is not possible, perhaps due to a transient phenomena,
            then a node may then choose to forward traffic towards siblings,
            moving across the DAG at the same level (neither inwards or
            outwards). When receiving traffic forwarded from a sibling, the
            traffic should not be forwarded back to the same sibling in order
            to avoid a 2-node loop. In a further example, a forwarding
            implementation may choose to decrease the hop limit more quickly
            when forwarding along sibling paths than along parent paths. A
            forwarding engine may behave in a manner similar to these
            examples, however the specific implementation of a forwarding
            engine and related path diversity strategies is beyond the scope
            of this specification.</t>

            <t>Note that the further interaction of the routing solution and
            the forwarding engine, in particular how they utilize and react to
            changes in metrics, and how the forwarding engine may use the
            constrained set of successors provided by the routing engine based
            on L2 triggers and metrics, is under investigation.</t>

            <t>By employing this procedure, the LLN is able to set up a
            path-constrained DAG, rooted at designated nodes, with other nodes
            organized along paths leading inward toward the DAG root. MP2P
            traffic intended for the default destination flows inward along
            the DAG towards the root, and nodes forwarding traffic are able to
            leverage the path diversity of the DAG as necessary.</t>

            <t>The DAG is then used by RPL as a reference topology,
            constraining the LLN routing problem, on which to build additional
            routing mechanisms.</t>

          <section title="Further Operation">
            <t>The sub-DAG of a node is the set of other nodes of greater
            depth in the DAG that might use a path towards the DAG root that
            contains this node. Depth in the DAG is defined such that nodes
            contained in the sub-DAG of a specific node should tend to have a
            greater depth than the node. Paths through siblings are not
            contained in this set.</t>

            <t>As a further illustration, consider the DAG examples in <xref
            target="Examples"></xref>. Consider Node (24) in the DAG Example
            depicted in <xref target="DAGExample"></xref>. In this example,
            the sub-DAG of Node (24) is comprised of Nodes (34), (44), and
            (45).</t>

            <t>A DAG may also be floating, in which case the node rooting the
            DAG is not offering a default route. Floating DAGs may be
            encountered, for example, during coordinated reconfigurations of
            the network topology wherein a node and its sub-DAG breaks off the
            DAG, temporarily becomes a floating DAG, and reattaches to a
            grounded DAG at a different (more optimal) location. (Such
            coordination endeavors to avoid the construction of transient
            loops in the LLN). A DAG, or a sub-DAG, may also become floating
            because of a network element failure.</t>

            <t>A node will generally join at least one DAG, typically (but not
            necessarily) to or through a LBR. This specification does not
            preclude a node from joining multiple DAGs. In one such case, a
            particular application may require the node to maintain membership
            in multiple DAGs in order to satisfy competing constraints, for
            example to support different types of traffic, similar to the
            concept of MTR (Multi-topology routing) as supported by other
            routing protocols such as IS-IS <xref target="RFC5120"></xref> or
            OSPF <xref target="RFC4915"></xref>, although the RPL mechanisms
            will significantly differ from the ones specified for these
            protocols. (Note that not all constrained traffic cases may
            require multiple DAGs). In support of such cases the RPL
            implementation must independently maintain requisite information
            and state for each DAG in parallel. In cases where a competing
            constraints must be satisfied toward the same DAG root, the OCP
            should differ by definition and may serve to coordinate the
            maintenance of the multiple DAGs.</t>

            <t>The IPv6 Router Advertisement mechanism (as specified in <xref

            maintain a DAG.</t>

            <t>The IPv6 Router Advertisement message is augmented with a DAG
            Information Option (DIO) in order to facilitate the formation and
            maintenance of DAGs. The information conveyed in the DIO includes
            the following:</t>

                derivation is typically closely related to one or more metrics
                as specified by the OCP. Used to support loop avoidance
                strategies and in support of ordering alternate successors
                when engaged in path maintenance.</t>

                <t>A vector of path metrics. As discussed in <xref

            <t>The Router Advertisements are issued whenever a change is
            detected to the DAG such that a node is able to determine that a
            region of the DAG has become inconsistent. As the DAG stabilizes
            the period at which Router Advertisements occur is configured to
            taper off, reducing the steady-state overhead of DAG maintenance.
            The periodic issue of Router Advertisements, along with the
            triggered Router Advertisements in response to inconsistency, is
            one feature that enables RPL to operate in the presence of
            unreliable links.</t>

          <section title="Selection of Feasible DAG Parents">
            <t>The decision for a node to join a DAG may be optimized
            according to implementation specific policy functions on the node
            as indicated by one or more specific OCP values. For example, a
            node may be configured for one goal to optimize a bandwidth metric
            (OCP-1), and with a parallel goal to optimize for a reliability
            metric (OCP-2). Thus two DAGs in parallel may be constructed and
            maintained in the LLN, DAG-1 would be optimized according to
            OCP-1, whereas DAG-2 would be optimized according to OCP-2. A node
            may then maintain two parallel sets of DAG parents. Note that in
            such a case traffic may directed along the appropriate constrained
            DAG based on traffic marking within the IPv6 header.</t>

            <t>As a node hears RAs from its neighbors it may process their
            DIOs. At this time the node may be able to take into
            consideration, for example, the following:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>Is the neighboring node heard reliably enough, and are the
                metrics stable enough, that a local degree of confidence may
                be established with respect to the neighboring node? Should
                the neighboring node be considered in the set of candidate
                neighbors?</t>

                <t>In consultation with implementation specific policy (OCP
                goal), is the neighboring node a feasible parent from a
                constrained-path perspective?</t>

                <t>According to the implementation specific policy (OCP), does
                the neighboring node offer a better optimized position into
                the DAG?</t>

                <t>Is the neighboring node a peer (sibling) within the
                DAG?</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Based on such considerations, the node may incorporate the
            neighboring node into the set of DAG parents.</t>

            <t>When the node inserts the first DAG parent into the empty DAG
            parent set, it is able to join the DAG. After the DAG parent set
            is updated, the node will consult a depth computation function
            indicated by the OCP for the DAG in order to determine its depth
            value, which it will subsequently advertise when it emits its own
            DIOs. A general property of the depth value presented by the node
            is that it should be greater than that presented by any of its DAG
            parents. It is recommended that a node maintain its DAG Parent set
            such that its most preferred parent from the OCP goals also has
            the greatest depth value in the DAG parent set. All reliable
            neighboring nodes of a lesser depth then the node may then be
            considered as potential DAG parents. All neighboring nodes of
            equal depth may come to be considered as siblings within the DAG
            (even though they may not have parents in common, they may still
            provide path diversity towards the DAG root).</t>

            <t>The computation of depth, and related properties, are further
            described in <xref target="DAGDepth"></xref>.</t>

            <section title="Example">
              <t>For example, suppose that a node (N) is not attached to any
              DAG, and that it is in range of nodes (A), (B), (C), (D), and
              (E). Let all nodes be configured to use an OCP which defines a
              policy such that ETX is to be minimized and paths with the
              attribute `Blue' should be avoided. Let the depth computation
              indicated by the OCP simply reflect the ETX aggregated along the
              path. Let the links between node (N) and its neighbors (A-E) all
              have an ETX of 1 (which is learned by node (N) through some
              implementation specific method). Let node (N) be configured to
              send Router Solicitations to probe for nearby DAGs.</t>

              <t><list style="symbols">
                  <t>Node (N) transmits a Router Solicitation.</t>

                  <t>Node (B) responds. Node (N) investigates the DIO, and
                  learns that Node (B) is a member of DAGID 1 at depth 4, and
                  not `Blue'. Node (N) takes note of this, but is not yet
                  confident.</t>

                  <t>Similarly, Node (N) hears from Node (A) at depth 9, Node
                  (C) at depth 5, and Node (E) at depth 4.</t>

                  <t>Node (D) responds. Node (D) has a DIO that indicates that
                  it is a member of DAGID 1 at depth 2, but it carries the
                  attribute `Blue'. Node (N)'s policy function rejects Node
                  (D), and no further consideration is given.</t>

                  <t>This process continues until Node (N), based on
                  implementation specific policy, builds up enough confidence
                  to trigger a decision to join DAGID 1. Let Node (N)
                  determine its most preferred parent to be Node (E).</t>

                  <t>Node (N) adds Node (E) (depth 4) to its set of DAG
                  Parents for DAGID 1. Following the mechanisms specified by
                  the OCP, and given that the ETX is 1 for the link between
                  (N) and (E), Node (N) is now at depth 5 in DAGID. 1.</t>

                  <t>Node (N) adds Node (B) (depth 4) to its set of DAG
                  Parents for DAGID 1.</t>

                  <t>Node (N) is a sibling of Node (C), both are at depth
                  5.</t>

                  <t>Node (N) may now forward traffic intended for the default
                  destination inward along DAGID 1 via nodes (B) and (E). In
                  some cases, e.g. if nodes (B) and (E) are tried and fail,
                  node (N) may also choose to forward traffic to its sibling
                  node (C), without making inward progress but with the
                  intention that node (C) or a following successor can make
                  inward progress.</t>

          <section title="DAG Maintenance">
            <t>When a node moves within a DAG, the move is defined as updating
            the set of DAG Parents for a particular DAGID, i.e. adding or
            deleting DAG Parents. Not all moves entail changes in depth.</t>

            <t>A jump in the context of a DAG is attaching to a new DAGID, in
            such a way that an old DAGID is replaced by the new DAGID. In
            particular, when an old DAGID is left, all associated parents are
            no longer feasible, and a new DAGID is joined.</t>

            <t>When a node in a DAG follows a DAG parent, it means that the
            DAG parent has changed its DAGID (e.g. by joining a new DAG) and
            that the node updates its own DAGID in order to keep the DAG
            parent.</t>

            <t>A frozen sub-DAG is a subset of nodes in the sub-DAG of a node
            who have been informed of a change to the node, and choose to
            follow the node in a manner consistent with the change, for
            example in preparation for a coordinated move. Nodes in the
            sub-DAG who hear of a change and have other options than to follow
            the node do not have to become part of the frozen sub-DAG, for
            example such a node may be able to remain attached to the original
            DAG through a different DAG Parent. A further example may be found
            in <xref target="SectionDAGMaintenance"></xref>.</t>

            <t>When the node encounters new candidate neighbors that offer
            higher positions in the DAG, it may incorporate them directly into
            its set of DAG parents. In this case the node may update its
            choice of most preferred parent, discarding a deeper node and
            possibly causing its own advertised depth to decrease. This case
            is `moving inwards along the DAG' and does not require any
            additional coordination for loop avoidance.</t>

            <t>If the DAG parent set of the node becomes completely depleted,
            the node will have detached from the DAG, and will become the root
            of its own floating DAG (thus establishing the frozen sub-DAG),
            and then may reattach to the original DAG at a lower point if it
            is able.</t>

            <t>When the node encounters candidate parents that are in a
            different DAG, and decides to leave the current DAG in order to
            join the different DAG, it may do so safely without regard to loop
            avoidance. However, it may not return immediately to the current
            DAG as such movement may trigger the creation of loops.</t>

            <t>When a node, and perhaps a related frozen sub-DAG, jumps to a
            different DAG, the move is coordinated by a DAG Hop timer. The DAG
            Hop timer allows the nodes who will attach closer to the sink of
            the new DAG to `jump' first, and then drag dependent nodes behind
            them, thus endeavoring to efficiently coordinate the attachment of
            the frozen sub-DAG into the new DAG. A further illustration of
            this mechanism may be found in <xref

        </section>

        <section title="Destination Advertisement">
          <t>As RPL constructs DAGs, nodes are able to learn a set of default
          routes in order to send traffic to the sink. However, this mechanism
          alone does is not sufficient to support P2MP traffic flowing outward
          along the DAG from the DAG root toward nodes. A Destination
          Advertisement mechanism is employed by RPL to build up routing state
          in support of these outward flows.</t>

          <section title="Destination Advertisement Option (DAO)">
            <t>A Destination Advertisement Option (DAO) is used to convey the
            Destination information inward along the DAG toward the DAG
            root.</t>

            <t>The information conveyed in the DAO includes the following:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>A lifetime and sequence counter to determine the freshness

                <t>Prefix information to identify the destination, which may
                be a prefix, an individual host, or multicast listeners</t>

                <t>Reverse Route information to record the nodes visited
                (along the outward path) when the intermediate nodes along the

              </list></t>
          </section>

          <section title="Destination Advertisement Operation">
            <t>As the DAG is constructed and maintained, nodes will emit
            messages containing Destination Advertisement Options to a subset

            an implementation specific policy.</t>

            <t>Note that further details of the message and its triggers are
            still under investigation, including whether or not the DAO should
            be a IPv6 Hop-By-Hop option or a Neighbor Discovery option.</t>

            <t>When a DAO reaches a node capable of storing routing state, the
            node extracts information from the DAO and updates its local
            database with a record of the DAO and who it was received from.
            When the node later propagates DAOs, it selects the best (least
            depth) information for each destination and conveys this
            information again in the form of DAOs to a subset of its own DAG
            parents. At this time the node may perform route aggregation if it
            is able, thus reducing the overall number of DAOs.</t>

            <t>When a DAO reaches a node incapable of storing additional
            state, the node MUST append its own address to a Reverse Route
            Stack carried within the DAO. The node then passes the DAO on to
            one or more of its DAG parents without storing any additional
            state.</t>

            <t>When a node that is capable of storing routing state encounters
            a DAO with a Reverse Route Stack that has been populated, the node
            knows that the DAO has traversed a region of nodes that did not
            record any routing state. The node is able to detach and store the
            Reverse Route State and associate it with the destination
            described by the DAO. Subsequently the node may use this
            information to construct a source route in order to bridge the
            region of nodes that are unable to support Hop-By-Hop routing to
            reach the destination.</t>

            <t>In this way the Destination Advertisement mechanism is able to
            provision routing state in support of P2MP traffic flows outward
            along the DAG, and as according to the available resources in the
            LLN nodes.</t>

            <t>Further aggregations of DAOs by destinations are possible in
            order to support additional scalability.</t>

            <t>A further example of the operation of the Destination
            Advertisement mechanism is available in <xref

      <section title="Other Considerations">
        <section anchor="DAGDepth" title="DAG Depth and Loop Avoidance">
          <t>When nodes select DAG Parents, they should select the most
          preferred parent according to their implementation specific
          objectives, using the cost metrics conveyed in the DIOs along the
          DAG in conjunction with the related objective functions as specified
          by the OCP.</t>

          <t>Based on this selection, the metrics conveyed by the most
          preferred DAG parent, the nodes own metrics and configuration, and a
          related function defined by the objective code point, a node will be
          able to compute a value for its depth as a consequence of selecting
          a most preferred DAG parent.</t>

          <t>It is important to note that the DAG Depth is not itself a
          metric, although its value is derived from and influenced by the use
          of metrics to select DAG parents and take up a position in the DAG.
          The computation of the DAG Depth MUST be done in such a way so as to
          maintain the following properties for any nodes M and N who are
          neighbors in the LLN:</t>

          <t><list>
              <t>For a node N, and its most preferred parent M, DAGDepth(N)
              &gt; DAGDepth(M) must hold. Further, all parents in the DAG
              parent set must be of a depth less than or equal to DAGDepth(M).
              (This mechanism serves to avoid loops in the case where an
              alternate parent is used- if no alternate parent is deeper than
              the preferred parent then loops are avoided. The risk of loops
              occurs when an alternate parent goes deeper, and traffic then
              makes backwards progress and comes back to the node again).</t>

              <t>If DAGDepth(M) &lt; DAGDepth(N), then M is located in a more
              optimum position than N in the DAG with respect to the metrics
              and optimizations defined by the objective code point. Node M
              may safely be a DAG Parent for Node N without risk of creating a
              loop.</t>

              <t>If DAGDepth(M) == DAGDepth(N), then M and N are located
              positions of relatively the same optimality within the DAG. In
              some cases, Node M may be used as a successor by Node N, but
              with related chance of creating a loop that must be detected and
              broken by some other means.</t>

              <t>If DAGDepth(M) &gt; DAGDepth(N), then node M is located in a
              less optimum position than N in the DAG with respect to the
              metrics and optimizations defined by the objective code point.
              Further, Node (M) may in fact be in Node (N)'s sub-DAG. There is
              no advantage to Node (N) selecting Node (M) as a DAG Parent, and
              such a selection may create a loop.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>For example, the DAG Depth could be computed in such a way so as
          to closely track ETX when the objective function is to minimize ETX,
          or latency when the objective function is to minimize latency, or in
          a more complicated way as appropriate to the objective code point
          being used within the DAG.</t>

          <t>The DAG depth is subsequently used to restrict the options a node
          has for movement within the DAG and to coordinate movements in order
          to avoid the creation of loops.</t>

          <t>A node may safely move `up' in the DAG, causing its DAG depth to
          decrease and moving closer to the DAG root without risking the
          formation of a loop.</t>

          <t>A node may not consider to move `down' the DAG, causing its DAG
          depth to increase and moving further from the DAG root. Such a move
          will entail moving to a less optimum position in the DAG in all
          cases, as defined by the objective code point. In the case where a
          node looses connectivity to the DAG, it must first leave the DAG
          before it may then rejoin at a deeper point.</t>

          <t>Any neighboring nodes of lesser or equal depth are eligible to be
          considered as DAG parents.</t>

            <t>Consider the example depicted in <xref
            target="DAGMaintenance"></xref>-1. In this example, Node (A) is
            attached to a DAG at some depth d. Node (A) is a DAG Parent of
            Nodes (B) and (C). Node (C) is a DAG Parent of Node (D). There is
            also an undirected sibling link between Nodes (B) and (C).</t>

            <t>In this example, Node (C) may safely forward to Node (A)
            without creating a loop. Node (C) may not safely forward to Node
            (D), contained within it's own sub-DAG, without creating a loop.
            Node (C) may forward to Node (B) in some cases, e.g. the link
            (C)-&gt;(A) is temporarily unavailable, but with some chance of
            creating a loop and requiring the intervention of additional
            mechanisms to detect and break the loop.</t>

            <t>Consider the case where Node (C) hears a DIO from a Node (Z) at
            a lesser depth and superior position in the DAG than node (A).
            Node (C) may safely undergo the process to evict node (A) from its
            DAG Parent set and attach directly to Node (Z) without creating a
            loop, because its depth will decrease.</t>

            <t>Consider the case where the link (C)-&gt;(A) becomes nonviable,
            and node (C) must move to a deeper depth within the DAG:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>Node (C) must first detach from the DAG by removing Node
                (A) from its DAG Parent set, leaving an empty DAG Parent set.
                Node (C) becomes the root of its own floating DAG.</t>

                <t>Node (D), hearing a modified RA-DIO from Node (C), follows
                Node (C) into the floating DAG. This is depicted in <xref
                target="DAGMaintenance"></xref>-2. In general, any node with
                no other options in the sub-DAG of Node (C) will follow Node
                (C) into the floating DAG, maintaining the structure of the
                sub-DAG.</t>

                <t>Node (C) hears a RA-DIO from Node (B) and determines it is
                able to rejoin the grounded DAG by reattaching at a deeper
                depth to Node (B). Node (C) starts a DAG Hop timer to
                coordinate this move.</t>

                <t>The timer expires and Node (C) adds Node (B) to its DAG
                Parent set. Node (C) has now safely moved deeper within the
                grounded DAG without creating any loops. Node (D), and any
                other sub-DAG of Node (C), will hear the modified RA-DIO
                sourced from Node (C) and follow Node (C) in a coordinated
                manner to reattach to the grounded DAG. The final DAG is

        <section title="DAG Parent Selection, Stability, and Greediness">
          <t>If a node is greedy and attempts to move deeper in the DAG,
          beyond its most preferred parent, in order to increase the size of
          the DAG Parent set, then an instability can result. This is
          illustrated in <xref target="Greedy"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Suppose a node is willing to receive and process a RA-DIOs from a
          node in its own sub-DAG, and in general a node deeper than it. In
          such cases a chance exists to create a feedback loop, wherein two or
          more nodes continue to try and move in the DAG in order to optimize
          against each other. In some cases this will result in an
          instability. It is for this reason that RPL recommends that a node
          MUST NOT receive and process RA-DIOs from deeper nodes. This rule
          creates an `event horizon', whereby a node cannot be influenced into
          an instability by the action of nodes that may be in its own
          sub-DAG.</t>

            <t>Consider the example depicted in <xref
            target="DAGMerge"></xref>. Nodes (A), (B), and (C) are part of
            some larger grounded DAG, where Node (A) is at a depth of d, Node
            (B) at d+1, and Node (C) at d+2. The DAG comprised of Nodes (D),
            (E), and (F) is a floating DAG, with Node (D) as the DAG root.
            This floating DAG may have been formed, for example, in the
            absence of a grounded DAG or when Node (D) had to detach from a
            grounded DAG and (E) and (F) followed. All nodes are using
            compatible objective code points.</t>

            <t>Nodes (D), (E), and (F) would rather join the grounded DAG if
            they are able than to remain in the floating DAG.</t>

            <t>Next, let links (C)--(D) and (A)--(E) become viable. The
            following sequence of events may then occur in a typical case:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>Node (D) will receive and process a RA-DIO from Node (C) on
                link (C)--(D). Node (D) will consider Node (C) a candidate
                neighbor, will note that Node (C) is in a grounded DAG at
                depth d+2, and will begin the process to join the grounded DAG
                at depth d+3. Node (D) will start a DAG Hop timer, logically
                associated with the grounded DAG at Node (C), to coordinate
                the jump. The DAG Hop timer will have a duration proportional
                to d+2.</t>

                <t>Similarly, Node (E) will receive and process a RA-DIO from
                Node (A) on link (A)--(E). Node (E) will consider Node (A) a
                candidate neighbor, will note that Node (A) is in a grounded
                DAG at depth d, and will begin the process to join the
                grounded DAG at depth d+1. Node (E) will start a DAG Hop
                timer, logically associated with the grounded DAG at Node (A),
                to coordinate the jump. The DAG Hop timer will have a duration
                proportional to d.</t>

                <t>Node (F) takes no action, for Node (F) has observed nothing
                new to act on.</t>

                <t>Node (E)'s DAG Hop timer for the grounded DAG at Node (A)
                expires first. Node (E), upon the DAG Hop timer expiry, is
                removes Node (D), thus emptying the DAG parent set for the
                floating DAG and leaving the floating DAG. Node (E) then jumps
                to the grounded DAG by entering Node (A) into the set of DAG
                Parents for the grounded DAG. Node (E) is now in the grounded
                DAG at depth d+1. Node (E), by jumping into the grounded DAG,
                has created an inconsistency and will begin to emit RA-DIOs
                more frequently.</t>

                <t>Node (F) will receive and process a RA-DIO from Node (E).
                Node (F) will observe that Node (E) has changed its DAGID and
                will directly follow Node (E) into the grounded DAG. Node (F)
                is now a member of the grounded DAG at depth d+2. Note that
                any additional sub-DAG of Node (E) would continue to join into
                the grounded DAG in this coordinated manner.</t>

                <t>Node (D) will receive a RA-DIO from Node (E). Since Node
                (E) is now in a different DAG, Node (D) may process the RA-DIO
                from Node (E). Node (D) will observe that, via node (E), it
                could attach to the grounded DAG at depth d+2. Node (D) will
                start another DAG Hop timer, logically associated with the
                grounded DAG at Node (E), with a duration proportional to d+1.
                Node (D) now is running two DAG hop timers, one which was
                started with duration proportional to d+1 and one proportional
                to d+2.</t>

                <t>Generally, Node (D) will expire the timer associated with
                the jump to the grounded DAG at node (E) first. Node (D) may
                then jump to the grounded DAG by entering Node (E) into its
                DAG Parent set for the grounded DAG. Node (D) is now in the
                grounded DAG at depth d+2.</t>

                <t>In this way RPL has coordinated a merge between the
                grounded DAG and the floating DAG, such that the nodes within
                the two DAGs come together in a generally ordered manner,
                avoiding the formation of loops in the process.</t>

        <section title="Local and Temporary Routing Decision">
          <t>Although implementation specific, it is worth noting that a node
          may decide to implement some local routing decision based on some
          metrics, as observed locally or reported in the DIO. For example,
          the routing may reflect a set of successors (next-hop), along with
          various aggregated metrics used to load balance the traffic
          according to some local policy. Such decisions are local and
          implementation specific.</t>

          <t>Routing stability is crucial in a LLN: in the presence of
          unstable links, the first option consists of removing the link from
          the DAG and triggering a DAG recomputation across all of the nodes
          affected by the removed link. Such a naive approach could
          unavoidably lead to frequent and undesirable changes of the DAG,
          routing instability, and high-energy consumption. The alternative
          approach adopted by RPL relies on the ability to temporarily not use
          a link toward a successor marked as valid, with no change on the DAG
          structure. If the link is perceived as non-usable for some period of
          time (locally configurable), this triggers a DAG recomputation,
          through the DAG Discovery mechanism further detailed in <xref
          target="DAGDiscovery"></xref>, after reporting the link failure.
          Note that this concept may be extended to take into account other
          link characteristics: for the sake of illustration, a node may
          decide to send a fixed number of packets to a particular successor
          (because of limited buffering capability of the successor) before
          starting to send traffic to another successor.</t>

          <t>According to the local policy function, it is possible for the
          node to order the DAG parent set from `most preferred' to `least
          preferred'. By constructing such an ordered set, and by appending
          the set with siblings, the node is able to construct an ordered list
          of preferred next hops to assist in local and temporary routing
          decisions. The use of the ordered list by a forwarding engine is
          loosely constrained, and may take into account the dynamics of the
          LLN. Further, a forwarding engine implementation may decide to
          perform load balancing functions using hash-based mechanisms to
          avoid packet re-ordering. Note however, that specific details of a
          forwarding engine implementation are beyond the scope of this
          document.</t>

          <t>These decisions may be local and/or temporary with the objective
          to maintain the DAG shape while preserving routing stability.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Scalability">
          <t>As each node selects DAG Parents according to implementation
          specific objectives, RPL is able to dynamically partition an LLN
          network into different regions, each anchored by a DAG root.
          Multiple DAG roots may be deployed in accordance with an
          implementation specific policy designed to limit the size of a
          partition, e.g. for performance or other reasons.</t>

          <t>A further example is illustrated in <xref
          target="AdditionalExamples"></xref>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Maintenance of Routing Adjacency">
          <t>In order to relieve the LLN of the overhead of periodic
          keepalives, RPL MAY employ an as-needed mechanism of NS/NA in order
          to verify routing adjacencies just prior to forwarding data. Pending
          the outcome of verifying the routing adjacency, the packet may
          either be forwarded or an alternate next-hop may be selected.</t>

    <section anchor="ConstrainedLLNs" title="Constraint Based Routing in LLNs">
      <t>This aim of this section is to make a clear distinction between
      routing metrics and constraints and define the term constraint based
      routing as used in this document.</t>

      <section title="Routing Metrics">
        <t>Routing metrics are used by the routing protocol to compute the
        shortest path according to one of more defined metrics. IGPs such as
        IS-IS (<xref target="RFC5120"></xref>) and OSPF (<xref
        target="RFC4915"></xref>) compute the shortest path according to a
        Link State Data Base (LSDB) using link metrics configured by the
        network administrator. Such metrics can represent the link bandwidth
        (in which case the metric is usually inversely proportional to the
        bandwidth), delay, etc. Note that in some cases the metric is a
        polynomial function of several metrics defining different link
        characteristics. The resulting shortest path cost is equal to the sum
        (or multiplication) of the link metrics along the path: such metrics
        are said to be additive or multiplicative metrics.</t>

        <t>Some routing protocols support more than one metric: in the vast
        majority of the cases, one metric is used per (sub)topology. Less
        often, a second metric may be used as a tie breaker in the presence of
        ECMP (Equal Cost Multiple Paths). The optimization of multiple metrics
        is known as an NP complete problem and is sometimes supported by some
        centralized path computation engine.</t>

        <t>In the case of RPL, it is virtually impossible to define *the*
        metric, or even a composite, that will fit it all:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Some information apply to path setup time, other apply to
            packet forwarding time.</t>

            <t>Some values are aggregated hop-by-hop, others are triggers from
            L2.</t>

            <t>Some properties are very stable, others vary rapidly.</t>

            <t>Some data are useful in a given scenario and useless in
            another.</t>

            <t>Some arguments are scalar, others statistical.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>For that reason, the RPL protocol core is agnostic to the logic
        that handles metrics. A node will be configured with some external
        logic to use and prioritize certain metrics for a specific scenario.
        As new heterogeneous devices are installed to support the evolution of
        a network, or as networks form in a totally ad-hoc fashion, it will
        happen that nodes that are programmed with antagonistic logics and
        conflicting or orthogonal priorities end up participating in the same
        network. It is thus RECOMMENDED to use consistent parent selection
        policy, as per Objective Code Points (OCP), to ensure consistent
        optimized paths.</t>

        <t>RPL is designed to survive and still operate, though in a somewhat
        degraded fashion, when confronted to such heterogeneity. The key
        design point is that each node is solely responsible for setting the
        vector of metrics that it sources in the DAG, derived in part from the
        metrics sourced from its preferred parent. As a result, the DAG is not
        broken if another node makes its decisions in as antagonistic fashion,
        though an end-to-end path might not fully achieve any of the
        optimizations that nodes along the way expect. The to-be-defined NULL
        OCP and related behaviors will further clarify this point.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Routing Constraints">
        <t>A constraint is a link or a node characteristic that must be
        satisfied by the computed path (using boolean values or lower/upper
        bounds) and is by definition neither additive nor multiplicative.
        Examples of links constraints are "available bandwidth",
        "administrative values (e.g. link coloring)", "protected versus
        non-protected links", "link quality" whereas a node constraint can be
        the level of battery power, CPU processing power, etc.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Constraint Based Routing">
        <t>The notion of constraint based routing consists of finding the
        shortest path according to some metrics satisfying a set of
        constraints. A technique consists of first filtering out all links and
        nodes that cannot satisfy the constraints (resulting in a
        sub-topology) and then computing the shortest path.</t>

              <t>The Destination Prefix suboption is used when the DAG root
              needs to indicate that it offers connectivity to destination
              prefixes other than the default. This may be useful in cases
              where more than one LBR is operating within the LLN and offering
              connectivity to different administrative domains, e.g. a home
              network and a utility network. (Note that a grounded DIO offers
              the default route without any other qualification needed). In
              such cases, upon observing the Destination Prefixes offered by a
              particular DAG root, a node MAY decide to join multiple DAGs in
              support of a particular application. Note that Destination
              Prefixes specified in this manner inherit the Router Lifetime of
              their parent RA.</t>

              <t>The Length is coded as the length of the suboption in octets,
              excluding the Type and Length fields. The Prefix Length is an
              8-bit unsigned integer that indicates the number of leading bits
              in the destination prefix. Prf is the Route Preference as in
              <xref target="RFC4191"></xref>. The Destination Prefix contains
              Prefix Length significant bits of the destination prefix. The
              remaining bits of the Destination Prefix, as required to
              complete the trailing octet, are set to 0.</t>

              <t>In the event that a DAG root may need to specify that it
              offers connectivity to more than one destination, the
              Destination Prefix suboption may be repeated.</t>

      <section title="Neighbor Discovery">
        <section title="RA-DIO Reception">
          <t>An node will come to discover its link layer neighbors by a
          combination of link layer mechanisms and by hearing the multicast RA
          messages from the neighbors. Through these mechanisms a node is able
          to construct a set of known neighbors.</t>

          <t>When receiving and processing the RA-DIO messages from known
          neighbors, in addition to link layer states and characteristics, the
          node will come to determine that a neighbor is of particular
          interest. As the LLN node periodically observes the neighbor and
          determines its behavior to be reliable beyond a certain threshold,
          the node may select the neighbor to be part of the candidate
          neighbor set and begin to maintain a local confidence value with
          respect to the neighbor.</t>

          <t>As RA-DIOs are received from candidate neighbors, the DIO
          information will be consulted to determine, for example:</t>

          <t><list style="numbers">
              <t>Does the candidate neighbor offer a position in a different
              DAG, or a better position in the current DAG? Is the OCP of the
              candidate neighbor compatible with the goals of this node? Do
              the related path metrics pass the criteria of a implementation
              specific policy function such that the candidate neighbor is
              considered feasible? If so then consider the candidate neighbor
              as a candidate parent. The decision to move up the DAG is a
              policy decision and a node may choose not to move up the DAG if
              the path metric is not significantly better than the current
              one.</t>

              <t>Does the candidate neighbor exist at the same depth in the
              current DAG as this node? Do the related path metrics pass the
              criteria of a implementation specific policy function such that
              the candidate neighbor is feasible? If so then consider the
              candidate neighbor as a DAG sibling.</t>

              <t>Otherwise, ignore the candidate neighbor. Ignored neighbors
              may periodically be re-evaluated to see if their situation has
              improved.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The implementation SHOULD provide the ability to bound the size
          of the candidate neighbor set, and a scheme SHOULD be applied to add
          and/or evict neighbors from the candidate neighbor set as necessary
          so as not to exceed the bounds.</t>

          <t>As candidate parents are identified, they may subsequently be
          promoted to DAG parents by following the rules of DAG Discovery as
          described below. When a node adds another node to its set of
          candidate parents, the node becomes attached to the DAG through the
          parent node.</t>

          <t>In the DAG Discovery implementation, the most preferred parent
          should be used to restrict which other nodes may become DAG parents.
          All nodes in the DAG Parent set should be of a depth less than or
          equal to the most preferred DAG parent.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="RA-DIO Transmission">
          <t>Each node maintains a timer that governs when to multicast RAs.
          This timer is implemented as a trickle timer operating over a
          variable interval. Trickle timers are further detailed in <xref
          target="TrickleImplementation"></xref>. The governing parameters for
          the timer should be configured consistently across the DAG, and are
          provided by the DAG root in the DIO. In addition to periodic RAs,
          each LLN node will respond to Router Solicitation messages according
          to <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>.</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>When a node detects an inconsistency, it may reset the
              interval of the trickle timer to a minimum value, causing RAs to
              be emitted more frequently as part of a strategy to quickly
              correct the inconsistency. Such inconsistencies may be, for
              example, an update to a key parameter (e.g. sequence number) in
              the DIO or a point-to-point loop detected when a node located
              inwards along the DAG forwards traffic intended for the default
              destination. Inconsistencies are further detailed in <xref
              target="TrickleInconsistencies"></xref>.</t>

              <t>When a node enters a mode of consistent operation within a
              DAG, it may begin to open up the interval of the trickle timer
              towards a maximum value, causing RAs to be emitted less
              frequently, thus reducing network maintenance overhead and
              saving energy consumption (which is of utmost importance for
              battery-operated nodes).</t>

              <t>When a node is initialized, it may choose to remain silent
              and not multicast any RAs until it has encountered and joined a
              DAG (perhaps initially probing for a nearby DAG with an RS).
              Alternately, it may choose to root its own floating DAG and
              begin multicasting RAs using a default trickle configuration.
              The second case may be advantageous if it is desired for
              independent nodes to begin aggregating into scattered floating
              DAGs in the absence of a grounded node, for example in support
              of LLN installation and commissioning.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Note that if multiple DAG roots are participating in the same
          DAG, i.e. offering DIOs with the same DAGID, then they must
          coordinate with each other to ensure that their DIOs are consistent
          when they emit RA-DIOs. In particular the Sequence number must be
          identical from each DAG root, regardless of which of the multiple
          DAG roots issues the DIO, and changes to the Sequence number should
          be issued at the same time. The specific mechanism of this
          coordination is beyond the scope of this specification.</t>

            <t>When an LLN learns about a DAG through a RA and makes the
            decision to join it, it initializes the state of the trickle timer
            by resetting the trickle timer and listening. Each time it hears
            an RA for this DAG, it increments C.</t>

            <t>When the timer fires at time T, the node compares C to the
            redundancy constant, DEFAULT_DIO_REDUNDANCY_CONSTANT. If C is less
            than that value, the node generates a new RA and broadcasts it.
            When the communication interval I expires, the node doubles the
            interval I so long as it has previously doubled it fewer then
            I_doubling times, resets C, and chooses a new T value.</t>

      <section anchor="DAGDiscovery" title="DAG Discovery">
        <t>DAG Discovery is a form of distance vector protocol for use in
        LLNs. DAG Discovery locates the nearest sink and forms a Directed
        Acyclic Graph towards that sink, by identifying a set of DAG parents.
        During this process DAG Discovery also identifies siblings, which may
        be used later to provide additional path diversity towards the DAG
        root. DAG Discovery enables nodes to implement different policies for
        selecting their DAG parents in the DAG by using implementation
        specific policy functions. DAG Discovery specifies a set of rules to
        be followed by all implementations in order to ensure interoperation.
        DAG Discovery also standardizes the format that is used to advertise
        the most common information that is used in order to select DAG
        parents.</t>

        <t>One of these information, the DAG depth, is used by DAG Discovery
        to provide loop avoidance even if nodes implement different policies.
        The DAG Depth is computed as specified by the Objective Code Point in
        use by the DAG, demonstrating the properties described in <xref
        target="DAGDepth"></xref>. The depth should be computed in such a way
        so as to provide a comparable basis with other nodes which may not use
        the same metric at all. (The to-be-defined NULL OCP and related
        behaviors will clarify this point).</t>

        <t>In order to organize and maintain loopless structure, the DAG
        Discovery implementation in the nodes MUST obey to the following rules
        and definitions:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>A node that does not have any DAG parents in a DAG is the root
            of its own floating DAG. It's depth is 1. A node will end up in
            that situation when it looses all of its current feasible parents,
            i.e. the set of DAG parents becomes depleted. In that case, the
            node SHOULD remember the DAGID and the sequence counter in the DIO
            of the lost parents for a period of time which covers multiple
            DIO.</t>

            <t>A LLN Node that is attached to an infrastructure that does not
            support DIO, is the DAG root of its own grounded DAG. It's depth
            is 1.</t>

            <t>A router sending a RA without DIO is considered a grounded
            infrastructure at depth 0. (For example, a router that is in
            communication with an LLN node but not running RPL such as a
            backbone router in communication with an LBR)</t>

            <t>The DAG root exposes the DAG in the Router Advertisement DAG
            Information Option and nodes propagate the DIO outwards along the
            DAG with the RAs that they forward over their LLN links.</t>

            <t>A node MAY move at any time, with no delay, within its DAG as
            long as such a move does not increase its own DAG depth, as per
            the depth calculation indicated by the OCP. If a node is required
            to move such that it cannot stay within the DAG without a depth
            increase, then it needs to first leave the DAG. In other words a A
            node that is already part of a DAG MAY move or follow a DAG parent
            at any time and with no delay in order to be closer, or stay as
            close, to the DAG root of its current DAG as it already is. But a
            node MUST NOT move outwards along the DAG that it is attached,
            except in the special case when choosing to follow the last DAG
            parent in the set of DAG parents. RAs received from other routers
            located higher in the same DAG may be considered as coming from
            candidate parents. RAs received from other routers located at the
            same depth in the same DAG may be considered as coming from
            siblings. Nodes MUST ignore RAs that are received from other
            routers located deeper within the same DAG.</t>

            <t>A node may jump from its current DAG into any different DAG if
            it is preferred for reasons of connectivity, configured
            preference, free medium time, size, security, bandwidth, DAG
            depth, or whatever metrics the LLN cares to use. A node may jump
            at any time and to whatever depth it reaches in the new DAG, but
            it may have to wait for a DAG Hop timer to elapse in order to do
            so. This allows the new higher parts (closer to the sink) of the
            DAG to move first, thus allowing stepped DAG reconfigurations and
            limiting relative movements. A node SHOULD NOT join a previous DAG
            (identified by its DAGID) unless the sequence number in the DIO
            has incremented since the node left that DAG. A newer sequence
            number indicates that the candidate parents were not attached
            behind this node, as they kept getting subsequent DIOs with new
            sequence numbers from the same DAG. In the event that old sequence
            numbers (two or more behind the present value) are encountered
            they are considered stale and the corresponding parent SHOULD be
            removed from the set.</t>

            <t>If a node has selected a new set of DAG parents but has not
            moved yet (because it is waiting for DAG Hop timer to elapse), the
            node is unstable and refrains from sending Router Advertisement -
            DAG Information Options.</t>

            <t>If a node receives a Router Advertisement - DAG Information
            Option from one of its DAG parents, and if the parent contains a
            different DAGID, indicating that the parent has left the DAG, and
            if the node can remain in the current DAG through an alternate DAG
            parent, then the node should remove the DAG parent which has
            joined the new DAG from its DAG parent set and remain in the
            original DAG. If the node was the last DAG parent then the node
            SHOULD follow that parent.</t>

            <t>When a node detects or causes a DAG inconsistency, as described
            in <xref target="TrickleInconsistencies"></xref>, then the node
            sends an unsolicited Router Advertisement message to its one-hop
            neighbors. The RA contains a DIO that propagates the new DAG
            information. Such an event will also cause the trickle timer
            governing the periodic RAs to be reset.</t>

            <t>If a DAG parent increases its depth such that the node depth
            would have to change, and if the node does not wish to follow
            (e.g. it has alternate options), then the DAG parent should be
            evicted from the DAG parent set. If the DAG parent is the last in
            the DAG parent set, then the node may chose to follow it.</t>
          </list></t>

        <section title="DAG Selection">
          <t>The DAG selection is implementation and algorithm dependent.
          Nodes SHOULD prefer to join DAGs advertising OCPs compatible with
          their implementation specific objectives. In order to limit erratic
          movements, and all metrics being equal, nodes SHOULD keep their
          previous selection. Also, nodes SHOULD provide a means to filter out
          a candidate parent whose availability is detected as fluctuating, at
          least when more stable choices are available. Nodes MAY place the
          failed candidate parent in a Hold Down mode that ensures that the
          candidate parent will not be reused for a given period of time.</t>

          <t>The known DAGs are associated with the candidate parents that
          advertise them and kept in a list by extending the Default Router
          List (DRL). DRL entries are extended to store the information
          received from the last DIO. The DRL MAY need to be modified in order
          to keep track of membership to multiple DAGs simultaneously. The DRL
          entries are managed by states and timers described in the next
          section.</t>

          <t>When connection to a fixed network is not possible or preferable
          for security or other reasons, scattered DAGs MAY aggregate as much
          as possible into larger DAGs in order to allow connectivity within
          the LLN. How to balance these DAGs is implementation dependent, and
          MAY use a specific visitor-counter suboption in the DIO.</t>

          <t>A node SHOULD verify that bidirectional connectivity and adequate
          link quality is available with a candidate neighbor before it
          considers that candidate as a DAG parent.</t>

        <section title="Administrative depth">
          <t>When the DAG is formed under a common administration, or when a
          node performs a certain role within a community, it might be
          beneficial to associate a range of acceptable depth with that node.
          For instance, a node that has limited battery should be a leaf
          unless there is no other choice, and may then augment the depth
          computation specified by the OCP in order to expose an exaggerated
          depth.</t>

                <t>Delay the reattachment of a sub-DAG that has been forced to
                detach. This is not as safe as the use of the sequence, but
                still covers that when a sub-DAG has detached, the Router
                Advertisement - DAG Information Option that is initiated by
                the new DAG root has a chance to spread outward along the
                sub-DAG so that two different DAGs have formed.</t>

                <t>Limit Router Advertisement - DAG Information Option storms
                when two DAGs collide/merge. The idea is that between the
                nodes from DAG A that decide to move to DAG B, those that see
                the highest place (closer to the DAG root) in DAG B will move
                first and advertise their new locations before other nodes
                from DAG A actually move.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>A new DAG is discovered upon a router advertisement message
            with or without a Router Advertisement - DAG Information Option.
            The node joins the DAG by selecting the source of the RA message
            as a DAG parent (and possible default gateway) and propagating the
            DIO accordingly.</t>

            <t>When a new DAG is discovered, the candidate parent that
            advertises the new DAG is placed in a held up state for the
            duration of a DAG Hop timer. If the resulting new set of DAG
            parents is more preferable than the current one, or if the node is
            intending to maintain a membership in the new DAG in addition to
            its current DAG, the node expects to jump and becomes
            unstable.</t>

            <t>A node that is unstable may discover other candidate parents
            from the same new DAG during the instability phase. It needs to
            start a new DAG Hop timer for all these. The first timer that
            elapses for a given new DAG clears them all for that DAG, allowing
            the node to jump to the highest position available in the new
            DAG.</t>

            <t>The duration of the DAG Hop timer depends on the DAG Delay of
            the new DAG and on the depth of candidate parent that triggers it:
            (candidates depth + random) * candidate's DAG_delay (where 0 &lt;=
            random &lt; 1). It is randomized in order to limit collisions and
            synchronizations.</t>

          <section title="Held-Down">
            <t>When a neighboring node is 'removed' from the Default Router
            List, it is actually held down for a hold down timer period, in
            order to prevent flapping. This happens when a node disappears
            (upon expiration timer).</t>

            <t>An node that is held down is not considered for the purpose of
            forwarding traffic inward along the DAG toward the root. When the
            hold down timer elapses, the node is removed from the DRL.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Collision">
            <t>A race condition occurs if 2 nodes send RA-DIO at the same time
            and then attempt to join each other. This might happen, for
            example, between nodes which act as DAG root of their own DAGs. In
            order to detect the situation, LLN Nodes time stamp the sending of
            RA-DIO. Any RA-DIO received within a short link-layer-dependent
            period introduces a risk. To resolve the collision, a 32bits
            extended preference is constructed from the DIO by concatenating
            the NodePreference with the BootTimeRandom.</t>

            <t>A node that decides to add a candidate to its DAG parents will
            do so between (candidate depth) and (candidate depth + 1) times
            the candidate DAG Delay. But since a node is unstable as soon as
            it receives the RA-DIO from the desired candidate, it will
            restrain from sending a RA-DIO between the time it receives the RA
            and the time it actually jumps. So the crossing of RA may only
            happen during the propagation time between the candidate and the
            node, plus some internal queuing and processing time within each
            machine. It is expected that one DAG delay normally covers that
            interval, but ultimately it is up to the implementation and the
            configuration of the candidate parent to define the duration of
            risk window.</t>

            <t>There is risk of a collision when a node receives an RA, for
            another candidate that is more preferable than the current
            candidate, within the risk window. In the face of a potential
            collision, the node with lowest extended preference processes the
            RA-DIO normally, while the router with the highest extended
            preference places the other in collision state, does not start the
            DAG hop timer, and does not become instable. It is expected that
            next RAs between the two will not cross anyway.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Instability">
            <t>A node is instable when it is prepared to shortly replace a set
            of DAG parents in order to jump to a different DAGID. This happens
            typically when the node has selected a more preferred candidate
            parent in a different DAG and has to wait for the DAG hop timer to
            elapse before adjusting the DAG parent set. Instability may also
            occur when the entire current DAG parent set is lost and the next
            best candidates are still held up. Instability is resolved when
            the DAG hop timer of all the candidate(s) causing instability
            elapse. Such candidates then change state to Current or Held-
            Down.</t>

            <t>Instability is transient (in the order of DAG hop timers). When
            a node is unstable, it MUST NOT send RAs with DIO. This avoids
            loops when node A decides to attach to node B and node B decides
            to attach to node A. Unless RAs cross (see Collision section), a
            node receives DIO from stable candidate parents, which do not plan
            to attach to the node, so the node can safely attach to them.</t>

            <t>When nodes are capable of storing routing state, they may
            inspect Destination Advertisements and learn hop-by-hop routing
            state toward destinations. In this process they may also learn
            necessary piecewise source routes to traverse regions of the LLN
            that do not maintain routing state. They may perform route
            aggregation on known destinations before emitting Destination
            Advertisements.</t>

            <t>When nodes are incapable of storing routing state, they may
            forward Destination Advertisements, recording the reverse route as
            the go in order to support the construction of piecewise source
            routes.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Nodes that are capable of storing routing state, and finally the
        DAG roots, are able to learn which destinations are contained in the
        sub-DAG below the node, and via which next-hop neighbors. The
        dissemination and installation of this routing state into nodes allows
        for Hop-By-Hop routing from the DAG root outwards along the DAG. The
        mechanism is further enhance by supporting the construction of source
        routes across stateless `gaps' in the DAG, where nodes are incapable
        of storing additional routing state. An adaptation of this mechanism
        allows for the implementation of loose-source or landmark (waypoint)
        routing.</t>

        <t>The design choice behind this is not to synchronize the parent and
        children databases along the DAG, but instead to update them regularly
        to cover from the loss of packets. The rationale for that choice is
        time variations in connectivity across unreliable links. If the
        topology can be expected to change frequently, synchronization might
        be an excessive goal in terms of exchanges and protocol complexity.
        The approach used here results in a simple protocol with no real
        peering. The Destination Advertisement mechanism hence provides for
        periodic updates of the derivative routing state, as cued by
        occasional RAs and other mechanisms.</t>

        <section title="Destination Advertisement Message Formats">
          <section anchor="DAOptionMessage" title="DAO Option">
            <t>RPL extends Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>
            and RFC4191 <xref target="RFC4191"></xref> to allow a node to
            include a Destination Advertisement option, which includes prefix
            information, in the Neighbor Advertisements (NAs). A prefix option
            is normally present in Router Advertisements (RAs) only, but the
            NA is augmented with this option in order to propagate destination
            information inwards along the DAG. The option is named the
            Destination Advertisement Option (DAO), and an NA containing this
            option may be referred to as a Destination Advertisement. The RPL
            use of Destination Advertisements allows the nodes in the DAG to
            build up routing state for nodes contained in the sub-DAG in
            support of traffic flowing outward along the DAG.</t>

        <section title="Destination Advertisement Operation">
          <section title="Overview">
            <t>Note that some aspects of the Destination Advertisement
            mechanism are still under investigation</t>

            <t>According to implementation specific policy, a subset or all of
            the feasible parents in the DAG may be selected to receive prefix
            information from the Destination Advertisement mechanism. This
            subset of DAG parents shall be designated the set of DA
            parents.</t>

            <t>RPL takes advantage of the DAG structure and allows a node
            capable of storing sufficient routing state to autonomously
            discover the destinations below itself through the operation of
            the Destination Advertisement mechanism. This allows participating
            nodes to build up routing state to support traffic flowing
            outwards along the DAG. Destination Advertisement messages convey
            the necessary information to learn the destinations.</t>

            <t>As Destination Advertisements for particular destinations move
            inwards along the DAG, a sequence counter is used to guarantee
            their freshness. The sequence counter is incremented by the source
            of the DAO (the node that owns the prefix), each time it issues a
            DAO for its prefix. Nodes who receive the DAO and, if scope
            allows, will be forwarding a DAO for the unmodified destination
            inwards along the DAG, will leave the sequence number unchanged.
            Intermediate nodes will check the sequence counter before
            processing a DAO, and if the DAO is unchanged (the sequence
            counter has not changed), then the DAO will be discarded without
            additional processing. Further, if the DAO appears to be out of
            synch (the sequence counter is 2 or more behind the present value)
            then the DAO state is considered to be stale and may be purged,
            and the DAO is discarded. A depth is also added for tracking
            purposes; the depth is incremented at each hop as the DAO is
            propagated up the DAG. Nodes who are storing routing state may use
            the depth to determine which possible next-hops for the
            destination are more optimal.</t>

            <t>If Destination Advertisements are activated in the DIO as
            indicated by the `D' bit, the node sends unicast Destination
            Advertisements to its DA parents, and only accepts unicast
            Destination Advertisements from any nodes BUT those contained in
            the DA parent subset.</t>

            <t>Every NA to a DA parent MAY contain one or more DAOs. Receiving
            a DAG Discovery RA-DIO with the `D' Destination Advertisement bit
            set from a DAG parent stimulates the sending of a delayed
            Destination Advertisement back, with the collection of all known
            prefixes (that is the prefixes learned via Destination
            Advertisements for nodes lower in the DAG, and any connected
            prefixes). A Destination Advertisement is also sent to a DAG
            parent once it has been added to the DA parent set after a
            movement, or when the list of advertised prefixes has changed.
            Destination Advertisements may also be scheduled for sending when
            the PathDigest of the DIO has changed, indicating that some aspect
            of the inwards paths along the DAG has been modified.</t>

            <t>Destination Advertisements may advertise positive (prefix is
            present) or negative (removed) DAOs. A no-DAO is stimulated by the
            disappearance of a prefix below. This is discovered by timing out
            after a request (a RA-DIO) or by receiving a no-DAO. A no-DAO is a
            conveyed as a DAO with a DAO Lifetime of 0.</t>

            <t>A node who is capable of recording the state information
            conveyed in a DAO will do so upon receiving and processing the
            DAO, thus building up routing state concerning destinations below
            it in the DAG. If a node capable of recording state information
            receives a DAO containing a Reverse Route Stack, then the node
            knows that the DAO has traversed one or more nodes that did not
            retain any routing state as it traversed the path from the DAO
            source to the node. The node may then extract the Reverse Route
            Stack and retain the included state in order to specify Source
            Routing instructions along the return path towards the
            destination. The node MUST set the RRCount back to zero and clear
            the Reverse Route Stack prior to passing the DAO information
            on.</t>

            <t>A node who is unable to record the state information conveyed
            in the DAO will append the next-hop address to the Reverse Route
            Stack, increment the RRCount, and then pass the Destination
            Advertisement on without recording any additional state. In this
            way the Reverse Route Stack will come to contain a vector of next
            hops that must be traversed along the reverse path that the DAO
            has traveled. The vector will be ordered such that the node
            closest to the destination will appear first in the list. In such
            cases the node may choose to convey the Destination Advertisement
            to one or more DAG Parents in order of preference as guided by an
            implementation specific policy.</t>

            <t>In hybrid cases, some nodes along the path a Destination
            Advertisement follows inward along the DAG may store state and
            some may not. The Destination Advertisement mechanism allows for
            the provisioning of routing state such that when a packet is
            traversing outwards along the DAG, some nodes may be able to
            directly forward to the next hop, and other nodes may be able to
            specify a piecewise source route in order to bridge spans of
            stateless nodes within the path on the way to the desired
            destination.</t>

            <t>In the degenerate case, no node is able to store any routing
            state as Destination Advertisements pass by, and the DAG sink ends
            up with DAOs that contain a completely specified route back to the
            originating node in the form of the inverted Reverse Route
            Stack.</t>

            <t>Information learned through Destination Advertisements can be
            redistributed in a routing protocol, MANET or IGP. But the MANET
            or the IGP SHOULD NOT be redistributed into Destination
            Advertisements. This creates a hierarchy of routing protocols
            where DA routes stand somewhere between connected and IGP
            routes.</t>

            <t>The Destination Advertisement mechanism requires stateful nodes
            to maintain lists of known prefixes. A prefix entry contains the
            following abstract information:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>A reference to the ND entry that was created for the
                advertising neighbor.</t>

                <t>The IPv6 address and interface for the advertising
                neighbor.</t>

                <t>The logical equivalent of the full Destination
                Advertisement information (including the prefixes, depth, and
                Reverse Route Stack, if any).</t>

                <t>A 'reported' Boolean to keep track whether this prefix was
                reported already, and to which of the DA parents.</t>

                <t>A counter of retries to count how many RA-DIOs were sent on
                the interface to the advertising neighbor without reachability
                confirmation for the prefix.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Note that nodes may receive multiple information from different
            neighbors for a specific destination, as different paths through
            the DAG may be propagating information inwards along the DAG for
            the same destination. A node who is recording routing state will
            keep track of the information from each neighbor independently,
            and when it comes time to propagate the DAO for a particular
            prefix to the DA parents, then the DAO information will be
            selected from among the advertising neighbors who offer the least
            depth to the destination.</t>

            <t>The Destination Advertisement mechanism stores the prefix
            entries in one of 3 abstract lists; the Connected, the Reachable
            and the Unreachable lists.</t>

            <t>The Connected list corresponds to the prefixes owned and
            managed by the local node.</t>

            <t>The Reachable list contains prefixes for which the node keeps
            receiving DAOs, and for those prefixes which have not yet timed
            out.</t>

            <t>The Unreachable list keeps track of prefixes which are no
            longer valid and in the process of being destroyed, in order to
            send no-DAOs to the DA parents.</t>

            <t>The Destination Advertisement mechanism requires 2 timers; the
            DelayNA timer and the DestroyTimer.</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>The DelayNA timer is armed upon a stimulation to send a
                Destination Advertisement (such as a DIO from a DA parent).
                When the timer is armed, all entries in the Reachable list as
                well as all entries for Connected list are set to not reported
                yet for that particular DA parent.</t>

                <t>The DelayNA timer has a duration that is DEF_NA_LATENCY
                divided by a multiple of the DAG depth. The intention is that
                nodes located deeper in the DAG should have a shorter DelayNA
                timer, allowing DAOs a chance to be reported from deeper in
                the DAG and potentially aggregated by sub-DAGs before
                propagating further inwards.</t>

                <t>The DestroyTimer is armed when at least one entry has
                exhausted its retries, which means that a number of RA-DIO
                were sent toward the reporting neighbor but that the entry was
                not confirmed with a DAO. When the destroy timer elapses, for
                all exhausted entries, the associated route is removed, and
                the entry is scheduled to be destroyed.</t>

                <t>The Destroy timer has a duration of min
                (MAX_DESTROY_INTERVAL, RA_INTERVAL).</t>
              </list></t>
          </section>

          <section title="Unicast Destination Advertisement messages from child to parent">
            <t>When sending a Destination Advertisement to a DA parent, a LLN
            Node includes the DAOs about not already reported prefix entries
            in the Reachable and Connected lists, as well as no-DAOs for all
            the entries in the Unreachable list. Depending on its policy and
            ability to retain routing state, the receiving node SHOULD keep a
            record of the reported DAO. If the DAO offers the best route to
            the prefix as determined by policy and other prefix records, the
            node SHOULD install a route to the prefix in the DAO via the link
            local address of the reporting neighbor and it SHOULD further
            propagate the information, either as a DAO or by means of
            redistribution into a routing protocol.</t>

            <t>The RA-DIO from the DAG root is used to synchronize the whole
            DAG, including the periodic reporting of Destination
            Advertisements back up the DAG. Its period is expected to vary,
            depending on the configuration of the trickle timer that governs
            the RAs.</t>

            <t>When a node receives a RA-DIO over an LLN interface from a DA
            parent, the DelayNA is armed to force a full update.</t>

            <t>When the node broadcasts a RA-DIO on an LLN interface, for all
            entries on that interface:</t>

            <t><list style="symbols">
                <t>If the entry is CONFIRMED, it goes PENDING with the retry
                count set to 0.</t>

                <t>If the entry is PENDING, the retry count is incremented. If
                it reaches a maximum threshold, the entry goes ELAPSED If at
                least one entry is ELAPSED at the end of the process: if the
                Destroy timer is not running then it is armed with a
                jitter.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Since the DelayNA has a duration that decreases with the depth,
            it is expected to receive all DAOs from all children before the
            timer elapses and the full update is sent to the DA parents.</t>

            <t>Once the Destroy timer is elapsed, the prefix entry is
            scheduled to be destroyed and moved to the Unreachable list if
            there are any DA parents that need to be informed of the change in
            status for the prefix, otherwise the prefix entry is cleaned up
            right away. The prefix entry is removed from the Unreachable list
            when no more DA parents need to be informed. This condition may be
            satisfied when a no-DAO is sent to all current DA parents
            indicating the loss of the prefix, and noting that in some cases
            parents may have been removed from the set of DA parents.</t>

          <section title="Aggregation of prefixes by a node">
            <t>There may be number of cases where a aggregation may be shared
            within a platoon of nodes. In such a case, it is possible to use
            aggregation techniques with Destination Advertisements and improve
            scalability. For example, consider a platoon formed by
            firefighters and their commander. Specifically, the commander may
            be configured as the Destination Advertisement aggregator for a
            group prefix. At run time, the commander absorbs the individual
            DAO information received from the platoon members down its sub-DAG
            and only reports the aggregation up the DAG. This works fine when
            the whole platoon is attached within the commander's sub-DAG.</t>

            <t>Other cases might occur for which additional support is
            required:</t>

            <t><list style="numbers">
                <t>The commander is attached within the sub-DAG of one of its
                platoon members.</t>

                <t>A platoon member is somewhere else within the DAG.</t>

                <t>A platoon member is somewhere else in the LLN.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>In all those cases, a node situated above the commander in the
            DAG but not above the platoon member will see the advertisements
            for the aggregation owned by the commander but not that of the
            individual platoon member prefix. So it will route all the packets
            for the platoon member towards the commander, but the commander
            will have no route to the individual platoon member and will fail
            to forward.</t>

            <t>Additional protocols may be applied beyond the scope of this
            specification to dynamically elect/provision a commander and
            platoon in order to provide route summarization for a sub-DAG.</t>

      <section anchor="MaintenanceRoutingAdjacency"
               title="Maintenance of Routing Adjacency">
        <t>The selection of successors, along the default paths inward along
        the DAG, or along the paths learned from Destination Advertisements
        outward along the DAG, leads to the formation of routing adjacencies
        that require maintenance.</t>

        <t>In IGPs such as OSPF <xref target="RFC4915"></xref> or IS-IS <xref
        target="RFC5120"></xref>, the maintenance of a routing adjacency
        involves the use of Keepalive mechanisms (Hellos) or other protocols
        such as BFD (<xref target="I-D.ietf-bfd-base"></xref>) and MANET
        Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-manet-nhdp"></xref>). Unfortunately, such an approach
        is not desirable in constrained environments such as LLN and would
        lead to excessive control traffic in light of the data traffic with a
        negative impact on both link loads and nodes resources. Overhead to
        maintain the routing adjacency should be minimized. Furthermore, it is
        not always possible to rely on the link or transport layer to provide
        information of the associated link state. The network layer needs to
        fall back on its own mechanism.</t>

        <t>Thus RPL makes use of a different approach consisting of probing
        the neighbor using a Neighbor Solicitation message (see <xref
        target="RFC4861"></xref>). The reception of a Neighbor Advertisement
        (NA) message with the "Solicited Flag" set is used to verify the
        validity of the routing adjacency. Such mechanism MAY be used prior to
        sending a data packet. This allows for detecting whether or not the
        routing adjacency is still valid, and should it not be the case,
        select another feasible successor to forward the packet.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Expectations of Link Layer Behavior">
        <t>This specification does not rely on any particular features of a
        specific link layer technologies. It is anticipated that an
        implementer should be able to operate RPL over a variety of different
        low power wireless or PLC (Power Line Communication) link layer
        technologies.</t>

        <t>Implementers may find <xref target="RFC3819">RFC 3819</xref> a
        useful reference when designing a link layer interface between RPL and
        a particular link layer technology.</t>

      governed by a trickle timer. Nodes (11), (12), (13), have selected (LBR)
      as their only parent, attached to the DAG at depth 2, and periodically
      advertise RA-DIO multicasts. Node (22) has selected (11) and (12) in its
      DAG parent set, and advertises itself at depth 3. Node (22) thus has a

        <postamble>Note that the links depicted represent directed links in
        the DAG overlaid on top of the physical topology depicted in <xref
        target="LLNExample"></xref>. As such, the depicted edges represent the
        relationship between nodes and their DAG parents, wherein all depicted
        edges are directed and oriented `up' on the page toward the DAG root
        (LBR). The DAG provides the default routes within the LLN, and serves
        as the foundation on which RPL builds further routing structure, e.g.
        through the Destination Advertisement mechanism.</postamble>

      <section title="Moving Down a DAG">
        <t>Consider node (56) in the example of <xref
        target="LLNExample"></xref>. In the unmodified example, node (56) is
        at depth 6 with one DAG parent, {(43)}, and one sibling (55). Suppose,
        for example, that node (56) wished to expand its DAG parent set to
        contain node (55), as {(43), (55)}. Such a change would require node
        (56) to detach from the DAG, to defer reattachment until a loop
        avoidance algorithm has completed, and to then reattach to the DAG
        with {(43), (55)} as it's DAG parents. When node (56) detaches from
        the DAG, it is able to act as the root of its own floating DAG and
        establish its frozen sub-DAG (which is empty). Node (56) can then
        observe that Node (55) is still attached to the original DAG, that its
        sequence number is able to increment, and deduce that Node (55) is
        safely not behind Node (56). There is then little change for a loop,
        and Node (56) may safely reattach to the DAG, with parents {(43),
        (55)}. At reattachment time, node (56) would present itself with a
        depth deeper than that of its deepest DAG parent (node (55) at depth
        6), depth 7.</t>
