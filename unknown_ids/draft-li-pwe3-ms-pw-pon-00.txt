          Multisegment Pseudowires in Passive Optical Networks
                       draft-li-pwe3-ms-pw-pon-00

Abstract

   This draft describes MS-PW application in a PON network.  Static
   configuration of one segment of PW is a typical case of MS-PW.  When
   MS-PW is implemented in a PON network, the large quantity of T-PE
   makes such static provisioning a heavy burden of network manager.
   Making use of management protocol of GPON helps to reduce the labor
   of configuration, simplify and speedup the PW provision procedure to
   a great extent, and notify to switching PE (OLT) ACs status on T-PE
   (ONU).  Link layer of GPON may also replace PSN to carry MPLS-PW.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 5659 [RFC5659] defines the architecture for multi-segment
   pseudowires (MS-PWs) satisfying requirements in RFC 5254 [RFC5254].
   Draft-ietf-pwe3-segmented-pw provides more detail on MS-PW.  MS-PW is
   a typical technology for certain applications, e.g. mobile backhaul.

   Among all technologies in access and metro networks, Passive Optical
   Network (PON) provides longer distance, higher bandwidth with better
   economy than other technologies like point-to-point Ethernet or DSL
   in many scenarios.  Mobile backhaul with PON network is already at
   its dawn.

   In a PON network, the ONU and OLT are adjacent nodes connected by
   Optical Distribution Network (ODN), which consists of optical fibers
   and optical splitters in a tree topology.  Link between each ONU and
   OLT is simulated as point to point, and there is no redundant path
   between them.  OLT resides in the central office, while ONUs reside
   in customer premises.  ONUs are deployed with a huge number and cost
   sensitive.

   In a mobile backhaul network, many 2G and 3G base stations still use
   legacy interfaces like TDM and ATM.  Therefore, PWs has to start from
   devices directly connected with base stations.  In the case of mobile
   backhauling with PON, ONUs connected with bases stations are T-PEs,
   while OLT is the switching point.  Routing protocols and dynamic
   labels allocation protocols like LDP will extremely increase ONUs'
   cost.  As there is no redundant link between each ONU and the OLT,
   routing and path selection are not necessary between the ONUs and the
   OLT.  This will greatly reduce the cost of an ONU when it acts as a
   PW PE node.  Therefore, static provision of PW labels between ONUs
   and the OLT is preferred.  However, if provision PW labels on ONUs by
   Network Management System directly requires a network manager touch
   each ONU one by one, which brings a large amount of OPEX.

   According to ITU-T G.984.4amd2 [G.984.4amd2] and G.988 [G.988], the
   management protocol of GPON can also configure variant PWs on ONU.
   This provides a cost-saving method of static provisioning of PW in a
   GPON network.  MPLS-PW may be either carried by PSNs as defined in
   RFC5659 [RFC5659], or by GPON link layer according to ITU-T
   G.984.3amd1 [G.984.3amd1].


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   The terminology specified in RFC3985 [RFC3985] and RFC5659 [RFC5659]
   applies.  In addition, we defined the following terms related with
   PON according to ITU-T G.984.1 [G.984.1]:

   o  Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON): A variant of the Passive
      Optical Network (PON) access technology supporting transmission
      rates in excess of 1Gbps and based on the ITU-T G.984 series of
      Recommendations.

   o  GPON Transmission Convergence (GTC) layer: A protocol layer of the
      GPON protocol suite that is positioned between the Physical Media
      Dependent (PMD) layer and the G-PON clients.  The GTC layer is
      composed of GTC Framing sublayer and GTC Adaptation sublayer.

   o  GPON Encapsulation Method (GEM).  A data frame transport scheme
      used in GPON systems that is connection-oriented and that supports
      fragmentation of the user data frames into variable sized
      transmission fragments.

   o  GEM Port.  An abstraction on the GTC adaptation sublayer
      representing a logical connection associated with a specific
      client packet flow.

   o  Optical distribution network (ODN).  In the PON context, a tree of
      optical fibers in the access network, supplemented with power or
      wavelength splitters, filters, or other passive optical devices.

   o  Optical Line Termination (OLT).  A device that terminates the
      common (root) endpoint of an ODN, implements a PON protocol, such
      as that defined by ITU-T G.984 series, and adapts PON PDUs for
      uplink communications over the provider service interface.  The
      OLT provides management and maintenance functions for the
      subtended ODN and ONUs.  In this draft, OLT is actually a network
      element with multiple PON ports and uplinks.

   o  Optical Network Termination (ONT).  A single subscriber device
      that terminates any one of the distributed (leaf) endpoints of an
      ODN, implements a PON protocol, and adapts PON PDUs to subscriber
      service interfaces.  An ONT is a special case of an ONU.

   o  Optical Network Unit (ONU).  A generic term denoting a device that
      terminates any one of the distributed (leaf) endpoints of an ODN,
      implements a PON protocol, and adapts PON PDUs to subscriber
      service interfaces.  In some contexts, an ONU implies a multiple
      subscriber device.

Internet-Draft                  MS-PW-PON                      July 2010


   o  ONT management and control interface (OMCI).  The management and
      control channel between OLT and ONT in PON network.  The OMCI
      protocol runs across a GEM connection between the OLT Controller
      and the ONT Controller that is established at ONT initialization.
      The OMCI protocol is asymmetric: the Controller in the OLT is the
      master and the one in the ONT is the slave.  A single OLT
      Controller using multiple instances of the protocol over separate
      control channels may control multiple ONTs.  The OMCI protocol is
      used to manage the ONT in areas of configuration, fault,
      performance and security.

   o  PON Network.  An OLT connected using an ODN to one or more ONUs or
      ONTs.


4.  Multi-Segment Pseudowire over PON Network Reference Model

   RFC5659 [RFC5659] provides several pseudowire emulation edge-to-edge
   (PWE3) reference architectures for the multi-segment case, which are
   general models extended from RFC3985 [RFC3985] to enable point-to-
   point pseudowires through multiple PSN tunnels.

   A GPON network consists of an Optical Line Termination (OLT), an
   Optical Distribution Network (ODN) and multiple Optical Network Units
   (ONU).  The ODN is actually a fiber tree that provides physical
   connections between the OLT and the ONUs.  GPON has its own physical
   layer and link layer.  GEM Port is a logical point-to-point
   connection between the OLT and each ONU over GPON Transmission
   Convergence (GTC) layer.  There could be more than one GEM port
   between the OLT and an ONU.  Each GEM port could be assigned
   different QoS and bandwidth.

             Figure A: MS-PW over PON Network Reference Model

   Network is partitioned into access segments and Metro/Core segments
   with the hub & spoke topology.

   MS-PW is recommended when extending PW technology to access nodes.
   This removes the need of full mesh.  It minimizes the number of PSN
   tunnel and signaling adjacencies terminating on access nodes and
   reduces the routing information processed by access nodes.  Thus it
   can enhance the scalability and lower the complexity.  The OLT is
   recommended as a S-PE to enable PW over GPON such that IP/MPLS
   functionality can be optimized within each segments.

   Figure A applies the MS-PW architecture in a PON network and shows
   the specific technologies usages.  The Terminating PE1 (T-PE1) is an
   Optical Network Unit (ONU), while Switching PE1 (S-PE1) is an Optical
   Line Termination (OLT).  GEM ports replace PSN tunnels between ONU
   (T-PE1) and OLT (S-PE1) across Optical Distribution Network (ODN),
   and a PSN tunnel extends from S-PE1 to T-PE2 across PSN.

   In a PON network, the ONUs and the OLT are adjacent nodes connected
   by Optical Distribution Network (ODN), which consists of optical
   fibers and optical splitters in a tree topology.  Routing or path
   selection is unnecessary, as there is only one unique path between
   each ONU and the OLT.


5.  MS-PW in PON for Mobile Backhaul

   As stated in RFC5254 [RFC5254], when a TDM access network is replaced

   with a packet-based infrastructure, initiating PWs closer to the end-
   user and converging multiple services onto a single access network
   may reduce expenses.  Backhauling 2G Base Stations (BS) by a packet
   network is a typical use case that may benefit from moving pseudowire
   PEs closer to the end-user and requires pseudowires to be extended
   into the access network.  In case the access network is a PON,
   pseudowires are expected to extend to Optical Network Units (ONUs).
   Mobile services are backhauled from base stations all the way back to
   a mobile network Controller via pseudowires.  PEs are attached by
   base stations and the Controller on both ends respectively.  This
   means each ONU acts as an edge PE that terminates attachment circuits
   (ACs) from base stations, and encapsulates native data in them to
   pseudowires.

   MS-PW is particularly preferred in this case according to RFC5659
   [RFC5659], as an edge PE (connected to the Controller) terminates N
   PWs to/from N different remote PEs (connected to base stations),
   which attach to a single intermediate PE.  The intermediate PE
   switches PWs In the network depicted in figure A, CE1 is the base
   station and CE2 is the controller.  ONUs are PW Terminating Provider
   Edge (T-PE) where Access Circuits are attached, while OLT is the PW
   Switching Provider Edge (S-PE).

   PON is a network with a tree topology that fits the infrastructure
   described above.  The OLT aggregates a large number of ONUs, which
   terminate ACs from base stations.  For economic reasons, ONUs are
   built to be low cost and without powerful routing or IP capabilities.
   The cost of ONUs will evidently increase if they are required to
   support similar PW setup and maintenance mechanisms as that used in
   the core network.  Multi-segment PW enables PW in PON network to use
   a different setup mechanism than that in the metro and core network,
   with the OLT performing an intermediate PE switching PWs between ONUs
   and the Controller.  For example, the core could use a dynamic
   control plane (T-LDP PWs over RSVP-TE tunnels), while the access
   network could be provisioned through the management plane using the
   Network Management Station.


6.  Label Provisioning for Pseudowires over PON

   In a PON network with MS-PW, where OLT acts as a switching point and
   ONU as a PE, provision of PWs between OLT and ONU may be performed
   through static configuration, e.g. from a NMS.  However, it incurs
   heavy burden of management if each ONU has to be touched to set up PW
   from ONUs to OLT and configure forwarding information on ONUs.  The
   huge number of ONUs makes this method quite forbidding.

   Using a management protocol over PON to provision pseudowire labels



Li & Zheng               Expires January 6, 2011                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  MS-PW-PON                      July 2010


   on ONUs largely reduces labor of static label configuration, while
   keeping simplicity of ONU by not implementing a dynamic control
   plane.

   Thanks to the management protocol in GPON system, ONT management and
   control interface (OMCI), a semi-static mechanism could be used to
   set up PWs from ONUs to OLT.  OMCI, running between the OLT and the
   ONUs, is the channel that OLT manages and controls ONUs.  All GPON
   physical layer and data GTC layer configuration on ONUs are installed
   via OMCI.  It also has the capability to configure MPLS-PW labels and
   related forwarding information on ONUs per ITU-T G984.4amd2
   [G.984.4amd2] and G.988 [G.988].  When using OMCI to provision PWs on
   ONU, the network manager only needs to send all configurations to the
   OLT, which will send all parameters to ONUs automatically through
   OMCI.  There is no need to touch each ONU.

   OMCI now supports configuration of variant types of PWs, e.g.  TDM,
   ATM and Ethernet.  Besides, OMCI can act as a signaling mechanism
   between ONU and OLT, which enables the ONU to notify AC status to
   OLT.


7.  MPLS-PW Switching in PON network

   Expanding PW to the ONU requires some form of routing hierarchy.  The
   approach taken here is to divide the network into access segments and
   Metro/Core segments.  The OLT is the interconnecting point of Hub and
   Spokes.  PSNs or GPON in the access segment are spoke tunnels, while
   PSNs in the core segment are hub tunnels.

   MPLS-PW in a PON network may use full PSN encapsulation by ignoring
   PON GTC layer.  According to ITU-T G.984.3amd1 [G.984.3amd1], MPLS-PW
   can be carried by GEM Port.  That is, in a GPON network, PSN of MPLS-
   PWs can be replaced by GEM Port.

                       +------------+   +------------+
                       |   PW       |   |    PW      |
                       +------------+   +------------+
                       |   GEM      |   |   MPLS     |
                       +------------+   +------------+
                       |  GPON-PHY  |   | Link layer |
                       +------------+   +------------+
                                        |    PHY     |
                                        +------------+

   Figure B illustrates protocol stacks on the OLT when GEM Port
   replaces PSN for MPLS-PW over GPON.  MPLS label for PSN is replaced
   by GEM Port ID.

   Multiple GEM Ports are supported for each pair of OLT and ONU, which
   enables multiple PSNs for each ONU.  According to current GPON system
   specification, one GPON port supports maximum 4096 GEM Ports shared
   by all ONUs connected to it.  One GPON port can aggregate maximum 64
   ONUs, but typically no more than 8 ONUs for bandwidth reason, when
   the ONU is a Multi-Dwelling Unit (MDU) or a Multi-Tenant Unit (MTU)
   that serves multiple subscribers.  There should be no scalability
   problem for GEM Ports to carry MPLS-PWs between ONU and OLT.


8.  IANA Considerations

   No new options or messages are defined in this document.


9.  Security Considerations

   GPON has its own security mechanism to guarantee each ONU are
   isolated on GPON link layer.  There is no other security issues
   concerned.
