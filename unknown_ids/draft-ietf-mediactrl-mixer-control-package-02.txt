Internet-Draft            Mixer Control Package            November 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a Media Control Channel Framework Package for
   conference mixers and connection mixers.  The package defines mixer
   management elements for creating, modifying and deleting conference
   mixers, elements for joining, modifying and unjoining media streams
   between connections and conferences (including mixers between
   connections), as well as associated responses and notifications.  The
   package also defines elements for auditing package capabilities and
   mixers.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   In this document, BCP 14/RFC 2119 [RFC2119] defines the key words
   "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL".  In addition, BCP 15 indicates requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

   The following additional terms are defined for use in this document:

   Application server:  A SIP [RFC3261] application server (AS) is a
      control client that hosts and executes services such as
      interactive media and conferencing in an operator's network.  An
      AS controls the media server (MS), influencing and impacting the
      SIP sessions terminating on a media server, which the AS may have
      established for example using SIP third party call control.

   Media Server:  A media server (MS) processes media streams on behalf
      of an AS by offering functionality such as interactive media,
      conferencing, and transcoding to the end user.  Interactive media
      functionality is realized by way of dialogs, which are identified
      by a URI and initiated by the application server.

   MS Conference:  A MS Conference provides the media related mixing
      resources and services for conferences.  In this document, A MS
      Conference is often referred to simply as a conference.

   MS Connection:  A Media Server connection represents the termination
      on a media server of one or more RTP [RFC3550] sessions that are
      associated to a single SIP dialog.  A media server receives media
      from the output(s) of a connection and it transmits media on the
      input(s) of a connection.

   Media Stream:  A media stream on a media server represents a media
      flow between either a connection and a conference, between two
      connections, or between two conferences.  Streams may be audio or
      video and may be bi-directional or uni-directional.

3.  Overview

   The SIP Control Framework [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework]
   provides a generic approach for establishment and reporting
   capabilities of remotely initiated commands.  The Framework utilizes
   many functions provided by the Session Initiation Protocol [RFC3261]
   (SIP) for the rendezvous and establishment of a reliable channel for
   control interactions.  The Control Framework also introduces the
   concept of a Control Package.  A Control Package is an explicit usage
   of the Control Framework for a particular interaction set.  This
   specification defines a package for media conference mixers and media
   connection mixers.

   This package defines mixer management elements for creating,
   modifying and deleting conference mixers, elements for joining,
   modifying and unjoining media streams between connections and
   conferences (including mixers between connections), as well as
   associated responses and notifications.  The package also defines
   elements for auditing package capabilities and mixers.

   This package has been designed to satisfy the IETF MediaCtrl
   requirements ([RFC5167]).  The package provides the major
   conferencing functionality of SIP Media Server languages such as
   MSCML ([RFC5022]) and MSML ([MSML]).  A key differentiator is that
   this package provides such functionality using the Media Control
   Channel Framework.

   Out of scope for this mixer package are more advanced functions
   including personalized video mixes for conference participants,
   support for floor control protocols, as well as support for video
   overlays and text insertion.  Such functionality may be addressed by
   extensions to this package (through addition of foreign elements or
   attributes from another namespace) or use of other control packages
   which could build upon this package.

   The functionality of this package is defined by messages, containing
   XML [XML] elements, transported using the Media Control Channel
   Framework.  The XML elements can be divided into two types: mixer
   management elements; and elements for auditing package capabilities
   as well as mixers managed by the package.

   The document is organized as follows.  Section 4 describes how this
   control package fulfills the requirements for a Media Control Channel
   Framework control package.  Section 5 describes the syntax and
   semantics of defined elements, including mixer management
   (Section 5.2) and audit elements (Section 5.3).  Section 6 describes
   an XML schema for these elements and provides extensibility by
   allowing attributes and elements from other namespaces.  Section 7

4.  Control Package Definition

   This section fulfills the mandatory requirement for information that
   MUST be specified during the definition of a Control Framework
   Package, as detailed in Section 8 of
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework].

4.1.  Control Package Name

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify and register a unique name.  The name and version of this
   Control Package is "msc-mixer/1.0" (Media Server Control - Mixer -
   version 1.0).  Its IANA registration is specified in Section 9.1.

   Since this is the initial ("1.0") version of the control package,
   there are no backwards compatibility issues to address.

4.2.  Framework Message Usage

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package to explicitly detail
   the control messages that can be used as well as provide an
   indication of directionality between entities.  This will include
   which role type is allowed to initiate a request type.

   This package specifies CONTROL and response messages in terms of XML
   elements defined in Section 5, where the message bodies have the MIME
   media type defined in Section 9.3.  These elements describe requests,
   response and notifications and all are contained within a root
   <mscmixer> element (Section 5.1).

   In this package, the MS operates as a Control Server in receiving
   requests from, and sending responses to, the AS (operating as Control
   Client).  Mixer management requests and responses are defined in
   Section 5.2.  Audit requests and responses are defined in
   Section 5.3.  Mixer management and audit responses are carried in a
   framework 200 response or REPORT message bodies.  This package's
   response codes are defined in Section 5.6.

   Note that package responses are different from framework response
   codes.  Framework error response codes (see Section 8 of
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework]) are used when the request
   or event notification is invalid; for example, a request is invalid
   XML (400), or not understood (500).

   The MS also operates as a Control Client in sending event
   notification to the AS (Control Server).  Event notifications
   (Section 5.2.4) are carried in CONTROL message bodies.  The AS MUST
   respond with a Control Framework 200 response.

Internet-Draft            Mixer Control Package            November 2008


4.3.  Common XML Support

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify if the attributes for media dialog or conference references
   are required.

   This package requires that the XML Schema in Section 17.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] MUST be supported for
   media dialogs and conferences.

   The package uses "connectionid" and "conferenceid" attributes for
   various element definitions (Section 5).  The XML schema (Section 6)
   imports the definitions of these attributes from the framework
   schema.

4.4.  CONTROL Message Body

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package to define the
   control body that can be contained within a CONTROL command request
   and to indicate the location of detailed syntax definitions and
   semantics for the appropriate body types.

   When operating as Control Server, the MS receives CONTROL messages
   with the MIME media type defined in Section 9.3 and a body containing
   a <mscmixer> element (Section 5.1) with either a mixer management or
   audit request child element.

   The following mixer management request elements are carried in
   CONTROL message bodies to MS: <createconference> (Section 5.2.1.1),
   <modifyconference> (Section 5.2.1.2), <destroyconference>
   (Section 5.2.1.3), <join> (Section 5.2.2.2), <modifyjoin>
   (Section 5.2.2.3) and <unjoin> (Section 5.2.2.4) elements.

   The <audit> request element (Section 5.3.1) is also carried in
   CONTROL message bodies.

   When operating as Control Client, the MS sends CONTROL messages with
   the MIME media type defined in Section 9.3 and a body containing a
   <mscmixer> element (Section 5.1) with a notification <event> child
   element (Section 5.2.4).

4.5.  REPORT Message Body

   The Control Framework requires a control package definition to define
   the REPORT body that can be contained within a REPORT command
   request, or that no report package body is required.  This section
   should indicate the location of detailed syntax definitions and
   semantics for the appropriate body types.

Internet-Draft            Mixer Control Package            November 2008


   When operating as Control Server, the MS sends REPORT bodies with the
   MIME media type defined in Section 9.3 and a <mscmixer> element with
   a response child element.  The response element for mixer management
   requests is a <response> element (Section 5.2.3).  The response
   element for an audit request is a <auditresponse> element
   (Section 5.3.2).

4.6.  Audit

   The Control Framework encourages Control Packages to specify whether
   auditing is available, how it is triggered as well as the query/
   response formats.

   This Control Packages supports auditing of package capabilities and
   mixers on the MS.  An audit request is carried in a CONTROL message
   and an audit response in a REPORT message (or a 200 response to the
   CONTROL if it can execute the audit in time).

   The syntax and semantics of audit request and response elements is
   defined in Section 5.3.

4.7.  Examples

   The Control Framework recommends Control Packages to provide a range
   of message flows that represent common flows using the package and
   this framework document.

   This Control Package provides examples of such message flows in
   Section 7.

5.  Element Definitions

   This section defines the XML elements for this package.  The elements
   are defined in the XML namespace specified in Section 9.2.

   The root element is <mscmixer> (Section 5.1).  All other XML elements
   (requests, responses and notification elements) are contained within
   it.  Child elements describe mixer management (Section 5.2) and audit
   (Section 5.3) functionality.  Response status codes are defined in
   Section 5.6 and type definitions in Section 5.7.

   Implementation of this control package MUST adhere to the syntax and
   semantics of XML elements defined in this section and the schema
   (Section 6).  The XML schema supports extensibility by allowing
   attributes and elements from other namespaces.  Implementations MAY
   support attributes and elements from other (foreign) namespaces.  If
   an MS implementation receives a <mscmixer> element containing
   attributes or elements from another namespace which it does not
   support, the MS MUST send a 428 response (Section 5.6).

   Extensible attributes and elements are not described in this section.
   In all other cases where there is a difference in constraints between
   the XML schema and the textual description of elements in this
   section, the textual definition takes priority.

   Usage examples are provided in Section 7.

5.1.  <mscmixer>

   The <mscmixer> element has the following attributes (in addition to
   standard XML namespace attributes such as xmlns):

   version:  a string specifying the mscmixer package version.  The
      value is fixed as '1.0' for this version of the package.  The
      attribute is mandatory.

   The <mscmixer> element has the following defined child elements, only
   one of which can occur:

   1.  mixer management elements defined in Section 5.2:

       <createconference>  create and configure a new conference mixer.
          See Section 5.2.1.1

          Section 5.3.1

       <auditresponse>  response to an audit request.  See Section 5.3.2

   For example, a request to the MS to create a conference mixer:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <createconference/>
   </mscmixer>

   and a response from the MS that the conference was successfully
   created:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <response status="200" conferenceid="conference1"/>
   </mscmixer>

5.2.  Mixer Elements

   This section defines the mixer management XML elements for this
   control package.  These elements are divided into requests, responses
   and notifications.

   Request elements are sent to the MS to request a specific mixer
   operation to be executed.  The following request elements are
   defined:

   <createconference>  create and configure a new a conference mixer.
      See Section 5.2.1.1

   <modifyconference>  modify the configuration of an existing
      conference mixer.  See Section 5.2.1.2

   <destroyconference>  destroy an existing conference mixer.  See
      Section 5.2.1.3

   <join>  create and configure media streams between connections and/or
      conferences (for example, add a participant to a conference).  See
      Section 5.2.2.2

   <modifyjoin>  modify the configuration of joined media streams.  See
      Section 5.2.2.3

   <unjoin>  delete a media stream (for example, remove a participant
      from a conference).  See Section 5.2.2.4

   Responses from the MS describe the status of the requested operation.
   Responses are specified in a <response> element (Section 5.2.3) which
   includes a mandatory attribute describing the status in terms of a
   numeric code.  Response status codes are defined in Section 5.6.  The
   MS MUST respond to a request message with a response message.  If the
   MS is not able to process the request and carry out the mixer
   operation, the request has failed and the MS MUST indicate the class
   of failure using an appropriate 4xx response code.  Unless an error
   response code is mandated for a specific class of error within this
   section, implementations follow Section 5.6 in determining the
   appropriate status code for the response.

   Notifications are sent from the MS to provide updates on the status
   of a mixer operation or subscription.  Notifications are specified in
   an <event> element (Section 5.2.4).

5.2.1.  Conference Elements

5.2.1.1.  <createconference>

   The <createconference> element is sent to the MS to request creation
   of a new conference (multiparty) mixer.

   The <createconference> element has the following attributes:

   conferenceid:  string indicating a unique name for the new
      conference.  If this attribute is not specified, the MS MUST
      create a unique name for the conference.  The value is used in
      subsequent references to the conference (e.g. as conferenceid in a

      <response>).  The attribute is optional.  There is no default
      value.

   reserved-talkers:  indicates the requested number of guaranteed
      speaker slots to be reserved for the conference.  A valid value is
      a non-negative integer (see Section 5.7.2).  The attribute is
      optional.  The default value is 0.

   reserved-listeners:  indicates the requested number of guaranteed
      listener slots to be reserved for the conference.  A valid value
      is a non-negative integer (see Section 5.7.2).  The attribute is
      optional.  The default value is 0.

   The <createconference> element has the following sequence of child
   elements:

   <codecs>:  an element to configure the codecs supported by the
      conference (see Section 5.4).  The element is optional.

   <audio-mixing>:  an element to configure the audio mixing
      characteristics of a conference (see Section 5.2.1.4.1).  The
      element is optional.

   <video-layouts>:  an element to configure the video layouts of a
      conference (see Section 5.2.1.4.2).  The element is optional.

      the layout of a conference (see Section 5.2.1.4.3).  The element
      is optional.

   <subscribe>:  an element to request subscription to conference
      events. (see Section 5.2.1.4.4).  The element is optional.

   If the conferenceid attribute specifies the name of a conference
   which already exists, the MS MUST report an error (405) and MUST NOT
   create the conference.

   If the MS is unable to configure the conference according to
   specified reserved-talkers or reserved-listeners attributes, the MS
   MUST report an error (420) and MUST NOT create the conference.

   If the MS is unable to configure the conference according to a
   specified <audio-mixing> element, the MS MUST report an error (421)
   and MUST NOT create the conference.

   If the MS is unable to configure the conference for any specified
   conference event specified in the <subscribe> element, the MS MUST
   report an error (422) and MUST NOT create the conference.

   If the MS is unable to configure the conference according to a
   specified <video-layouts> element, the MS MUST report an error (423)
   and MUST NOT create the conference.

   If the MS is unable to configure the conference according to a
   specified <video-switch> element, the MS MUST report an error (424)
   and MUST NOT create the conference.

   If the MS is unable to configure the conference according to a
   specified <codecs> element, the MS MUST report an error (425) and
   MUST NOT create the conference.

   When a MS has finished processing a <createconference> request, it
   MUST reply with an appropriate <response> element (Section 5.2.3).

   For example, a request to create an audio video conference mixer with
   specified codecs, video layout, video switch and subscription:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <createconference conferenceid="conference1"
          reserved-talkers="1" reserved-listeners="10">
      <codecs>
       <codec>
        <subtype>H264</subtype>
       </codec>
       <codec>
        <subtype>PCMA</subtype>
       </codec>
      </codecs>
      <audio-mixing type="nbest"/>
      <video-layouts>
       <video-layout min-participants="1">single-view</video-layout>
       <video-layout min-participants="2">dual-view</video-layout>
       <video-layout min-participants="3">quad-view</video-layout>
      </video-layouts>
      <video-switch type="vas" interval="5"/>
      <subscribe>
       <active-talkers-sub interval="4"/>
      </subscribe>
    </createconference>
   </mscmixer>

   and a response from the MS if the conference was successfully
   created:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <response status="200" conferenceid="conference1"/>
   </mscmixer>

   alternatively, a response if MS could not create the conference due
   to a lack of support for the H264 codec:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <response status="425" conferenceid="conference1"
              reason="H264 codec not supported"/>
   </mscmixer>

5.2.1.2.  <modifyconference>

   The <modifyconference> element is sent to the MS to request
   modification of an existing conference.

   The <modifyconference> element has the following attributes:

   conferenceid:  string indicating the name of the conference to
      modify.  This attribute is mandatory.

   The <modifyconference> element has the following sequence of child
   elements (1 or more):

   <codecs>:  an element to configure the codecs supported by the
      conference (see Section 5.4).  Existing participants are
      unaffected by any policy change.  The element is optional.

   <audio-mixing>:  an element to configure the audio mixing
      characteristics of a conference (see Section 5.2.1.4.1).  The
      element is optional.

   <video-layouts>:  an element to configure the video layouts of a
      conference (see Section 5.2.1.4.2).  The element is optional.

   <video-switch>:  an element to configure the video switch policy for
      the layout of a conference (see Section 5.2.1.4.3).  The element
      is optional.

   <subscribe>:  an element to request subscription to conference
      events. (see Section 5.2.1.4.4).  The element is optional.

   If the conferenceid attribute specifies the name of a conference
   which does not exist, the MS MUST report an error (406).

   If the MS is unable to configure the conference according to a
   specified <audio-mixing> element, the MS MUST report an error (421)
   and MUST NOT modify the conference in any way.

   If the MS is unable to configure the conference for any specified
   conference event specified in the <subscribe> element, the MS MUST

   report an error (422) and MUST NOT modify the conference in anyway.

   If the MS is unable to configure the conference according to a
   specified <video-layouts> element, the MS MUST report an error (423)
   and MUST NOT modify the conference in any way.

   If the MS is unable to configure the conference according to a
   specified <video-switch> element, the MS MUST report an error (424)
   and MUST NOT modify the conference in any way.

   If the MS is unable to configure the conference according to a
   specified <codecs> element, the MS MUST report an error (425) and
   MUST NOT modify the conference.

   When a MS has finished processing a <modifyconference> request, it
   MUST reply with an appropriate <response> element (Section 5.2.3).

5.2.1.3.  <destroyconference>

   The <destroyconference> element is sent to the MS to request
   destruction of an existing conference.

   The <destroyconference> element has the following attributes:

   conferenceid:  string indicating the name of the conference to
      destroy.  This attribute is mandatory.

   The <destroyconference> element does not specify any child elements.

   If the conferenceid attribute specifies the name of a conference
   which does not exist, the MS MUST report an error (406).

   When a MS has finished processing a <destroyconference> request, it
   MUST reply with an appropriate <response> element (Section 5.2.3).

   Successfully destroying the conference (status code 200) will result
   in all connection or conference participants being removed from the
   conference mixer, <unjoin-notify> notification events
   (Section 5.2.4.2) being sent for each conference participant and a
   <conferenceexit> notification event (Section 5.2.4.3) indicating that
   conference has exited.  A <response> with any other status code
   indicates that the conference mixer still exists and participants are
   still joined to the mixer.

5.2.1.4.  Conference Configuration

   The elements in this section are used to establish and modify the
   configuration of conferences.

5.2.1.4.1.  <audio-mixing>

   The <audio-mixing> element defines the configuration of the
   conference audio mix.  It has no child elements and has the following
   attributes:

   type:  is a string indicating the audio stream mixing policy.
      Defined values are: "nbest" (where the N best participant signals
      are mixed) and "controller" (where the contributing participant(s)
      is/are selected by the controlling AS via an external floor
      control protocol).  The default value is "nbest".  The attribute
      is optional.

5.2.1.4.2.  <video-layouts>

   The <video-layouts> element describe the video presentation layout
   configuration for participants providing a video input stream to the
   conference.  This element allows multiple video layouts to be
   specified so that the MS automatically changes layout depending on
   the number of video-enabled participants.

   The <video-layouts> element has no attributes.

   The <video-layouts> element has the following sequence of child
   elements (1 or more):

   <video-layout>:  element describing a video layout
      (Section 5.2.1.4.2.1).

   If the MS does not support video conferencing at all, or does not
   support multiple video layouts, or does not support a specific video
   layout, the MS MUST report an 408 error in the response to the
   request element containing the <video-layouts> element.

   An MS MAY support more than one <video-layout> element, although only
   one layout can be active at a time.  A <video-layout> is active if
   the number of participants in the conference is equal to or greater
   than the value of its "min-participants" attribute, but less than the
   value of the "min-participants" attribute for any other <video-
   layout> element.  An MS MUST report an error if more than one <video-
   layout> has the same value for the "min-participants" attribute.
   When the number of regions within the active layout is greater than
   the number of participants in the conference, the display of
   unassigned regions is implementation-specific.

   The assignment of participant video streams to regions within the
   layout is according to the video switch policy specified by the
   <video-switch> element (Section 5.2.1.4.3).

   For example, a fragment describing a single layout:

   <video-layouts>
     <video-layout>single-view</video-layout>
   </video-layouts>

   And a fragment describing a sequence of layouts:

   <video-layouts>
     <video-layout min-participants="1">single-view</video-layout>
     <video-layout min-participants="2">dual-view</video-layout>
     <video-layout min-participants="3">quad-view</video-layout>
     <video-layout min-participants="5">multiple-3x3</video-layout>
   </video-layouts>

   When the conference has one participant providing a video input
   stream to the conference, then the single-view format is used.  When
   the conference has two such participants, the dual-view layout is
   used.  When the conference has three or four participants, the quad-
   view layout is used.  When the conference has five or more
   participants, the multiple-3x3 layout is used.

5.2.1.4.2.1.  <video-layout>

   The <video-layout> element describes a video layout containing one or
   more regions in which participant video input streams are displayed.

   The <video-layout> element has the following attributes:

   min-participants:  the minimum number of conference participants
      needed to allow this layout to be active.  A valid value is a
      positive integer (see Section 5.7.3).  The attribute is optional.
      The default value is 1.

   The <video-layout> element has a content model specifying the name of
   the video layout.

   It is RECOMMENDED that an MS support the predefined video layouts
   defined in the XCON conference information data model
   ([I-D.ietf-xcon-common-data-model]).  The MS MAY support other video
   layouts.  It is RECOMMENDED that non-XCON layouts are prefixed with a
   label; for example, <video-layout>mylayout:single-view<video-layout>.

   Each video layout has associated with it one or more regions.  The
   XCON layouts have associated the following named regions:

                     Figure 9: multiple-5x1 video layout

5.2.1.4.3.  <video-switch>

   The <video-switch> element describe the configuration of the
   conference policy for how participant's input video streams are
   assigned to regions within the active video layout.

   The <video-switch> element has the following attributes:

   type:  a string indicating the video switching policy of the
      conference.  Defined values are:

      vas  (Voice Activated Switching) enables automatic display of the
         most active speaker participant also providing a video input
         stream to the conference.  Participants who do not provide an
         audio stream are not considered for automatic display.  If a
         participant provides more than one audio stream, then the
         policy for inclusion of such a participant in the VAS is
         implementation-specific; an MS could select one stream, sum
         audio streams or ignore the participant for VAS consideration.
         If there is only one region in the layout, then the most active
         speaker is displayed there.  If more than one region is
         available, then the most active speaker is displayed in the
         largest region, if any, and then in the first region from the
         top-left corner of the layout.  The MS assigns the remaining
         regions based on the priority mechanism described in



Melanchuk, et al.          Expires May 7, 2009                 [Page 24]

         Section 5.2.1.4.3.1.

      controller  enables manual control over video switching.  The
         controller AS determines how the regions are assigned based on
         an external floor control policy.  The MS receives <join>,
         <modifyjoin> and <join> commands with a <stream> element
         (Section 5.2.2.5) indicating the region where the stream is
         displayed.  If no explicit region is specified, the MS assigns
         the region based on the priority mechanism described in
         Section 5.2.1.4.3.1.

      An MS MAY support other video switching policies.  It is
      RECOMMENDED that other policy names are prefixed with a label;
      e.g. "mypolicies:policy1".  The attribute is optional.  The
      default value is 'vas'.

   interval:  specifies the period between video switches as a number of
      seconds.  In the case of 'vas' policy, a speaker needs to be the
      most active speaker for the interval before the switch takes
      place.  A valid value is a non-negative integer (see
      Section 5.7.2).  A value of 0 indicates that switching is applied
      immediately.  The attribute is optional.  The default value is 3
      (seconds).

   activespeakermix:  indicates whether or not the active speaker
      participant receives a video stream without themselves displayed
      in the case of the 'vas' switching policy.  If enabled, the MS
      needs to generate two video streams for each conference mix: one
      for the active speaker participant without themselves displayed -
      details of this video layout are implementation-specific; and one
      for other participants as described in the 'vas' switch policy
      above.  A valid value is a boolean (see Section 5.7.1).  A value
      of true indicates that a separate video mix is generated for the
      active speaker without themselves being displayed.  A value of
      false indicates that all participants receive the same video mix.
      The attribute is optional.  The default value is false.  If the
      type attribute is not set to 'vas', the MS MUST ignore this
      attribute.

   If the MS does not support the specified video switching policy or
   other configuration parameters (including separate active speaker
   video mixes), then MS MUST report a 409 error (Section 5.6) in the
   response to the request element containing the <video-switch>
   element.

   If the MS receives a <join> or <modifyjoin> request containing a a
   <stream> element (Section 5.2.2.5) specifying a region and the
   conference video switching policy is set to 'vas', then the MS MUST

Internet-Draft            Mixer Control Package            November 2008


   ignore the region (i.e. conference switching policy takes
   precedence).

   If the MS receives a <join> or <modifyjoin> request containing a
   <stream> element (Section 5.2.2.5) specifying a region which is not
   defined for the currently active video layout, the MS MUST NOT report
   an error.  Even though the participant is not currently visible, the
   MS MUST display the participant if the layout changes to one which
   defines the specified region.

   The <video-switch> element has no child elements.

   For example, a fragment specifying a 'vas' video switching policy
   with an interval of 2s

    <video-switch type="vas" interval="2"/>

   For example, a fragment specifying a 'controller' video switching
   policy where video switching takes place immediately:

    <video-switch type="controller" interval="0"/>

5.2.1.4.3.1.  Priority assignment

   In cases where the video switching policy does not explicitly
   determine the region to which a participant is assigned, the
   following priority assignment mechanism applies:

   1.  Each participant has an (positive integer) priority value: the
       lower the value, the higher the priority.  The priority value is
       determined by the <priority> child element (Section 5.2.2.5.4) of
       <stream>.  If not explicitly specified, the default priority
       value is 100.

   2.  The MS uses priority values to assign participants to regions in
       the video layout which remain unfilled after application of the
       video switching policy.  The MS MUST dedicate larger and/or more
       prominent portions of the layout to participants with higher
       priority values first (e.g. first all participants with priority
       1, then those with 2, 3, etc).

   3.  The policy for displaying participants with the same priority is
       implementation-specific.

   The MS applies this priority policy each time the video layout is
   changed or updated.  It is RECOMMENDED that the MS does not move a
   participant from one region to another unless required by the video
   switching policy when an active video layout is updated.

Internet-Draft            Mixer Control Package            November 2008


   This model allows the MS to apply default video layouts after
   applying the video switch policy.  For example, region 2 is
   statically assigned to Bob, so the priority mechanism only applies to
   regions 1, 3, 4, etc.

5.2.1.4.4.  <subscribe>

   The <subscribe> element is a container for specifying conference
   notification events to which a controlling entity subscribes.
   Notifications of conference events are delivered using the <event>
   element (see Section 5.2.4).

   The <subscribe> element has no attributes, but has the following
   child element:

   <active-talkers-sub>:  subscription to active talker events
      (Section 5.2.1.4.4.1).  The element is optional.

   The MS SHOULD support a <active-talkers-sub> subscription.  It MAY
   support other event subscriptions.  If the MS does not support a
   requested subscription, it MUST send a <response> with a 422 status
   code.

5.2.1.4.4.1.  <active-talkers-sub>

   The <active-talkers-sub> element has the following attributes:

   interval:  the minimum amount of time (in seconds) that must elapse
      before further active talker events can be generated.  A valid
      value is a non-negative integer (see Section 5.7.2).  A value of 0
      suppresses further notifications.  The attribute is optional.  The
      default value is 3 (seconds).

   The <active-talker-sub> element has no child elements.

   Active talker notifications are delivered in the <active-talker-
   notify> element (Section 5.2.4.1).

5.2.2.  Joining Elements

5.2.2.1.  Joining Model

   The <join> operation creates a media stream between a connection and
   a conference, between connections, or between conferences.  This sub-
   section describes the model of conferences and connections and
   specifies the behavior for join requests to targets that already have
   an associated media stream.

   Conferences support multiple inputs and have resources to mix them
   together.  A media server conference in essence is a mixer that
   combines media streams.  A simple audio mix simply sums its input
   audio signals to create a single common output.  Conferences however
   use a more complex algorithm so that participants do not hear
   themselves as part of the mix.  That algorithm, sometimes called an
   n-minus mix, subtracts each participants input signal from the summed
   input signals, creating a unique output for each contributing
   participant.  Each <join> operation to a conference uses one of the
   conferences available inputs and/or outputs, to the maximum number of
   supported participants.

   A connection is the termination of a RTP session(s) on a media
   server.  It has a single input and output for each media session
   established by its SIP dialog.  The output of a connection may feed
   several different inputs such as both a conference mix and a
   recording of that participants audio.

   Joining two connections which are are not joined to anything else
   simply creates a media stream from the outputs(s) of one connection
   to the corresponding inputs(s) of the other connection.  It is not
   necessary to combine media from multiple sources in this case.  There
   are however several common scenarios where combining media from
   several sources to create a single input to a connection is needed.

   In the first case, a connection may be receiving media from one
   source, for example a conference, and it is necessary to play an
   announcement to the connection so that both the conference audio and
   announcement can be heard by the conference participant.  This is
   sometimes referred to as a whisper announcement.  An alternative to a
   whisper announcement is to have the announcement pre-empt the
   conference media.

   Another common case is the call center coaching scenario where a
   supervisor can listen to the conversation between an agent and a
   customer, and provide hints to the agent, which are not heard by the
   customer.

   Both of these cases can be solved by having the controlling AS create
   one or more conferences for audio mixing and to join and unjoin the
   media streams as required.  A better solution is to have the media
   server automatically mix media streams that are requested to be
   joined to a common input when only the simple summing of audio
   signals as described above is required.  This is the case for both
   the use cases presented above.

   Automatically mixing streams has several benefits.  Conceptually, it
   is straight forward and simple, requiring no indirect requests on the

   part of the controlling AS.  This increases transport efficiency and
   reduces the coordination complexity and the latency of the overall
   operation.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that a media server be able
   to automatically mix at least two audio streams where only the simple
   summing of signals is required.

   When a media server receives a <join> request, it MUST automatically
   mix all of the media streams included in the request with any streams
   already joined to one of the entities identified in the request, or
   it MUST fail the request and MUST NOT join any of the streams.  A
   controlling AS MUST use the <createconference> request for generic
   conferences where the complex mixing algorithm is required.

   Specifications which extend this package to handle additional media
   types such as text or video, MUST define the semantics of the join
   operation when multiple streams are requested to be joined to a
   single input, such as that for a connection with a single RTP session
   per media type.

5.2.2.2.  <join>

   The <join> element is sent to the MS to request creation one or more
   media streams either between a connection and a conference, between
   connections, or between conferences.  The two entities to join are
   specified by the attributes of <join>.

   Streams may be of any media type, and may be bi-directional or uni-
   directional.  A bi-directional stream is implicitly composed of two
   uni-directional streams that can be manipulated independently.  The
   streams to be established are specified by child <stream> elements
   (see Section 5.2.2.5).

   The <join> element has the following attributes:

   id1:  an identifier for either a connection or a conference.  The
      identifier MUST conform to the syntax defined in Section 17.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] The attribute is
      mandatory.

   id2:  an identifier for either a connection or a conference.  The
      identifier MUST conform to the syntax defined in Section 17.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] The attribute is
      mandatory.

   Note: Section 17.1 of [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework]
   defines the semantics for a conference identifier but not its syntax.
   Media server implementations need to distinguish between conferences
   and connections based upon the values of the "id1" and "id2"

   attributes.

   The <join> element has the following child element (0 or more):

   <stream>:   an element that both identifies the media streams to join
      and defines the way that they are to be joined (see
      Section 5.2.2.5).  The element is optional.

   If no <stream> elements are specified, then the default is to join
   all streams between the entities according to the media configuration
   of the connection or conference.

   One or more <stream> elements may be specified so that individual
   media streams can be controlled independently.  For example, if a
   connection supports both audio and video streams, a <stream> element
   could be used to indicate that only the audio stream is used in
   receive mode.  In cases where there are multiple media streams of the
   same type for a connection or conference, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   configuration is explicitly specified using <stream> elements.

   It is an error if a <stream> element is in conflict with (a) another
   <stream> element, (b) with specified connection or conference media
   capabilities, (c) with a SDP label value as part of the connection-id
   (see Section 17.1 of [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework]) or
   (d) if the media stream configuration is not supported by the MS.

   If the MS is unable to execute the join as specified in <stream>
   elements, the MS MUST report an error (407) and MUST NOT join the
   entities.

   If the MS is unable to join an entity to a conference because it is
   full, then the MS MUST report an error (410).

   If the specified entities are already joined, then the MS MUST report
   an error (408).

   If the MS does not support joining two specified connections
   together, the MS MUST report an error (426).

   If the MS does not support joining two specified conferences
   together, the MS MUST report an error (427).

   If the MS is unable to join the specified entities for any other
   reason, the MS MUST report an error (411).

   When the MS has finished processing a <join> request, it MUST reply
   with an <response> element (Section 5.2.3).

   For example, a request to join two connection together:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <join id1="connnection1" id2="connection2"/>
   </mscmixer>

   and the response if the MS doesn't support joining media streams
   between connections:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <response status="426" reason="mixing connections not supported"/>
   </mscmixer>

5.2.2.3.  <modifyjoin>

   The <modifyjoin> element is sent to the MS to request changes in the
   configuration of media stream(s) that were previously established
   between a connection and a conference, between two connections, or
   between two conferences.

   The <modifyjoin> element has the following attributes:

   id1:  an identifier for either a connection or a conference.  The
      identifier MUST conform to the syntax defined in Section 17.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] The attribute is
      mandatory.

   id2:  an identifier for either a connection or a conference.  The
      identifier MUST conform to the syntax defined in Section 17.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] The attribute is
      mandatory.

   The <modifyjoin> element has the following child elements (1 or
   more):

   <stream>:   an element that both identifies the media streams to
      modify and defines the way that each stream should now be
      configured (see Section 5.2.2.5).

   The MS MUST support <modifyjoin> for any stream that was established
   using <join>.

   The media server MUST configure the streams that are included within
   <modifyjoin> to that stated by the child elements.  It MUST NOT
   change the configuration of any streams not included as child
   elements.

   If the MS is unable to modify the join as specified in <stream>

   elements, the MS MUST report an error (407) and MUST NOT modify the
   join between the entities.

   If the specified entities are not already joined, then the MS MUST
   report an error (408).

   If the MS is unable to modify the join between the specified entities
   for any other reason, the MS MUST report an error (411).

   When an MS has finished processing a <modifyjoin> request, it MUST
   reply with an appropriate <response> element (Section 5.2.3).

5.2.2.4.  <unjoin>

   The <unjoin> element is sent to the MS to request removal of
   previously established media stream(s) from between a connection and
   a conference, between two connections, or between two conferences.

   The <unjoin> element has the following attributes:

   id1:  an identifier for either a connection or a conference.  The
      identifier MUST conform to the syntax defined in Section 17.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] The attribute is
      mandatory.

   id2:  an identifier for either a connection or a conference.  The
      identifier MUST conform to the syntax defined in Section 17.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] The attribute is
      mandatory.

   The <unjoin> element has the following child element (0 or more
   occurrences):

   <stream>:   an element that identifies the media stream(s) to remove
      (see Section 5.2.2.5).  The element is optional.  When not
      present, all currently established streams between "id1" and "id2"
      are removed.

   The MS MUST support <unjoin> for any stream that was established
   using <join> and has not already been removed by a previous <unjoin>
   on the same stream.

   If the MS is unable to terminate any join as specified in <stream>
   elements, the MS MUST report an error (407) and MUST NOT terminate
   the join between the entities.

   If the specified entities are not already joined, then the MS MUST
   report an error (409).

   If the MS is unable to terminate the join between the specified
   entities for any other reason, the MS MUST report an error (411).

   When an MS has successfully processed a <unjoin> request, it MUST
   reply with a successful <response> element (Section 5.2.3).

5.2.2.5.  <stream>

   <join>, <modifyjoin> and <unjoin> require the identification and
   manipulations of media streams.  Media streams represent the flow of
   media between a participant connection and a conference, between two
   connections, or between two conferences.  The <stream> element is
   used (as a child to <join>, <modifyjoin> and <unjoin) to identify the
   media stream(s) for the request and to specify the configuration of
   the media stream.

   The <stream> element has the following attributes:

   media:  a string indicating the type of media associated with the
      stream.  It is strongly recommended that the following values are
      used for common types of media: "audio" for audio media, and
      "video" for video media.  The attribute is mandatory.

   label:  a string indicating the SDP label associated with a media
      stream ([RFC4574]).  The attribute is optional.

   direction:  a string indicating the allowed media flow of the stream
      relative to the value of the "id1" attribute of the parent
      element.  Defined values are: "sendrecv" (media can be sent and
      received), "sendonly" (media can only be sent), "recvonly" (media
      can only be received) and "inactive" (stream established but no
      media flow).  The default value is "sendrecv".  The attribute is
      optional.

   The <stream> element has the following sequence of child elements:

   <volume>:  an element (Section 5.2.2.5.1) to configure the volume or
      gain of the media stream.  The element is optional.

   <clamp>:  an element (Section 5.2.2.5.2) to configure filtering and
      removal of tones from the media stream.  The element is optional.

   <region>:  an element (Section 5.2.2.5.3) to configure a region
      within a video layout where the media stream is displayed.  The
      element is optional.

Internet-Draft            Mixer Control Package            November 2008


   <priority>:  an element (Section 5.2.2.5.4) to configure priority
      associated with the stream in the media mix.  The element is
      optional.

   In each child element, the media stream affected is from the value of
   the "id1" attribute of the parent element.

   If the "media" attribute does not have the value of "audio", then the
   MS MUST ignored <volume> and <clamp> elements.

   If the "media" attribute does not have the value of "video", then the
   MS MUST ignored <region> element.

5.2.2.5.1.  <volume>

   The <volume> element is used to configure the volume of an audio
   media stream.  It may be set to a specific gain amount, to
   automatically adjust the gain to a desired target level, or to mute
   the volume.

   The <volume> element has no child elements but has the following
   attributes:

   controltype:  a string indicating the type of volume control to use
      for the stream.  Defined values are: "automatic" (the volume will
      be adjusted automatically to the level specified by the "value"
      attribute), "setgain" (use the value of the "value" attribute as a
      specific gain measured in dB to apply), "setstate" (set the state
      of the stream to "mute" or "unmute" as specified by the value of
      the "value" attribute).  The attribute is mandatory.

   value:  a string specifying the amount or state for the volume
      control defined by the value of the "controltype" attribute.  The
      attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

5.2.2.5.2.  <clamp>

   The <clamp> element is used to configure whether tones should be
   filtered and removed from a media stream.

   The <clamp> element has no child elements but has the following
   attributes:

   tones:  A space-separated list of the tones to remove.  The attribute
      is mandatory.

5.2.2.5.3.  <region>

   The <region> element is used to explicitly specify the region within
   a video layout where the media stream is displayed.

   The <region> element has no attributes and its content model
   specifies the name of the region layout.

5.2.2.5.4.  <priority>

   The <priority> element is used to explicitly specify the priority of
   a participant.  The MS uses this priority to determine where the
   media stream is displayed within a video layout
   (Section 5.2.1.4.3.1).

   The <priority> element has no attributes and its content model
   specifies a positive integer (see Section 5.7.3).  The lower the
   value, the higher the priority.

5.2.3.  <response>

   Responses to requests are indicated by a <response> element.

   The <response> element has following attributes:

   status:  numeric code indicating the response status.  Valid values
      are defined in Section 5.6.  The attribute is mandatory.

   reason:  string specifying a reason for the response status.  The
      attribute is optional.

   conferenceid:  string identifying the conference (see Section 17.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework]).  The attribute is
      optional.

   connectionid:  string identifying the SIP dialog connection (see
      Section 17.1 of [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework]).  The
      attribute is optional.

   For example, a response when a conference was created successfully:

   <response code="200">
    <reason>Success</reason>
   </response>


   The response if conference creation failed due to the requested
   conference id already existing:

   <response code="403">
    <reason>Conf already exists</reason>
   </response>


5.2.4.  <event>

   When a mixer generates a notification event, the MS sends the event
   using an <event> element.

   The <event> element has no attributes, but has the following sequence
   of child elements (0 or more instances of each child):

   <active-talkers-notify>  specifies an active talkers notification
      (Section 5.2.4.1).

   <unjoin-notify>  notifies that a connection or conference has been
      completely unjoined (Section 5.2.4.2).

   <conferenceexit>  notifies that a conference has exited
      (Section 5.2.4.3).

5.2.4.1.  <active-talkers-notify>

   The <active-talkers-notify> element describes zero or more speakers
   that have been active in a conference during the specified interval
   (see Section 5.2.1.4.4.1).

   The <active-talkers-notify> element has the following attributes:

   conferenceid:  string indicating the name of the conference from
      which the event originated.  This attribute is mandatory.

   The <active-talkers-notify> element has the following sequence of
   child elements (0 or more occurrence's):

   <active-talker>  element describing an active talker
      (Section 5.2.4.1.1).

5.2.4.1.1.  <active-talker>

   The <active-talker> element describes an active talker, associated
   with either a connection or conference participant in a conference.

   The <active-talker> element has the following attributes:

   connectionid:  string indicating the connectionid of the active
      talker.  This attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   conferenceid:  string indicating the conferenceid of the active
      talker.  This attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   It is an error (400) if both the connectionid and conferenceid
   attributes are specified.

   The <active-talker> element has no child elements.

5.2.4.2.  <unjoin-notify>

   The <unjoin-notify> element describes a notification event where a
   connection and/or conference have been completely unjoined.

   The <unjoin-notify> element has the following attributes:

   status:  a status code indicating why the unjoin occurred.  A valid
      value is a non-negative integer (see Section 5.7.2).  A value of 1
      indicates that the join has been terminated by a <unjoin> request.
      A value of 2 indicates that the unjoin occurred because the a
      connection or conference has terminated.  A value of 3 indicates
      the join terminated due to an internal error.  Any other value
      indicates an error defined by the MS.  The attribute is mandatory.

   reason:  a textual description providing a reason for the status
      code; e.g. details about an error.  A valid value is a string (see
      Section 5.7.4).  The attribute is optional.  There is no default
      value.

   id1:  an identifier for either a connection or a conference.  The
      identifier MUST conform to the syntax defined in Section 17.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] The attribute is
      mandatory.

   id2:  an identifier for either a connection or a conference.  The
      identifier MUST conform to the syntax defined in Section 17.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] The attribute is
      mandatory.

   The <unjoin-notify> element has no child elements.

5.2.4.3.  <conferenceexit>

   The <conferenceexit> element indicates that a conference has exited
   because it has been terminated or because a error occurred (for
   example, a hardware error in the conference mixing unit).  This event

Internet-Draft            Mixer Control Package            November 2008


   MUST be sent by the MS whenever a successfully created conference
   exits.

   The <conferenceexit> element has the following attributes:

   conferenceid:  string indicating the name of the conference.  This
      attribute is mandatory.

   status:  a status code indicating why the conference exited.  A valid
      value is a non-negative integer (see Section 5.7.2).  A value of 1
      indicates that the conference has been terminated by a
      <destroyconference> request.  Any other value indicates an error
      defined by the MS.  The attribute is mandatory.

   reason:  a textual description providing a reason for the status
      code; e.g. details about an error.  A valid value is a string (see
      Section 5.7.4).  The attribute is optional.  There is no default
      value.

   The <conferenceexit> element has no child elements.

   When a MS sends a <conferenceexit> event, the identifier for the
   conference (conferenceid attribute) is no longer valid on the MS and
   can be reused for another conference.

   For example, the following notification event would be sent from the
   MS when the conference with identifier "conference99" exits due to a
   successful <destroyconference/>:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <event>
     <conferenceexit conferenceid="conference99"
        status="1"/>
    </event>
   </mscmixer>

5.3.  Audit Elements

   The audit elements defined in this section allow the MS to be audited
   for package capabilities as well as mixers managed by the package.
   Auditing is particularly important for two use cases.  First, it
   enables discovery of package capabilities supported on an MS before
   an AS creates a conference mixer or joins connections and
   conferences.  The AS may then use this information to create request
   elements using supported capabilities and, in the case of codecs, to
   negotiate an appropriate SDP for a user agent's connection.  Second,
   auditing enables discovery of the existence and status of mixers
   currently managed by the package on the MS.  This allows one AS to

Internet-Draft            Mixer Control Package            November 2008


   take over management of mixers when the AS which initiated the mixers
   fails or is no longer available.

5.3.1.  <audit>

   The <audit> request element is sent to the MS to request information
   about the capabilities of, and mixers currently managed with, this
   control package.  Capabilities include supported conference codecs
   and video layouts.  Mixer information includes the status of managed
   mixers as well as codecs.

   The <audit> element has the following attributes:

   capabilities:  indicates whether package capabilities are to be
      audited.  A valid value is a boolean (see Section 5.7.1).  A value
      of true indicates that capability information is to be reported.
      A value of false indicates that capability information is not to
      be reported.  The attribute is optional.  The default value is
      true.

   mixers:  indicates whether mixers currently managed by the package
      are to be audited.  A valid value is a boolean (see
      Section 5.7.1).  A value of true indicates that mixer information
      is to be reported.  A value of false indicates that mixer
      information is not to be reported.  The attribute is optional.
      The default value is true.

   conferenceid:  string identifying a specific conference mixer to
      audit.  It is an error (406) if the conferenceid attribute is
      specified and the conference identifier is not valid.  The
      attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   If the mixers attribute has the value true and conferenceid attribute
   is specified, then only audit information about the specified
   conference mixer is reported.  If the mixers attribute has the value
   false, then no mixer audit information is reported even if a
   conferenceid attribute is specified.

   The <audit> element has no child elements.

   When the MS receives an <audit> request, it MUST reply with a
   <auditresponse> element (Section 5.3.2) which includes a mandatory
   attribute describing the status in terms of a numeric code.  Response
   status codes are defined in Section 5.6.  If the request is
   successful, the <auditresponse> contains (depending on attribute
   values) a <capabilities> element (Section 5.3.2.1) reporting package
   capabilities and a <mixers> element (Section 5.3.2.2) reporting
   managed mixer information.  If the MS is not able to process the

   request and carry out the audit operation, the audit request has
   failed and the MS MUST indicate the class of failure using an
   appropriate 4xx response code.  Unless an error response code is
   mandated for a specific class of error within this section,
   implementations follow Section 5.6 in determining the appropriate
   status code for the response.

   For example, a request to audit capabilities and mixers managed by
   the package:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
     <audit/>
   </mscmixer>

   In this example, only capabilities are to be audited:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
     <audit mixers="false"/>

Internet-Draft            Mixer Control Package            November 2008


   The <codecs> element has the following sequence of child elements (0
   or more occurrences):

   <codec>:  defines a codec and optionally its policy(Section 5.4.1).
      The element is optional.

   For example, a fragment describing two codecs:

   <codecs>
     <codec>
      <subtype>PCMA</subtype>
     </codec>
     <codec>
       <subtype>H263</subtype>
     </codec>
   </codecs>

5.4.1.  <codec>

   The <codec> element describes a codec.  The element is modeled on the
   <codec> element in the XCON conference information data model
   ([I-D.ietf-xcon-common-data-model]) and allows addition information
   (e.g. rate, speed, etc) to be specified.

   The <codecs> element has no attributes.

   The <codecs> element has the following sequence of child elements:

   <subtype>:  element describing the codec's name.  The possible values
      of this element are the values of the 'subtype' column of the RTP
      Payload Format media types per [RFC4855] defined in IANA ([IANA]).
      The element is mandatory.

   <params>:  element (Section 5.5) describing additional information
      about the codec.  This package is agnostic to the names and values
      of the codec parameters supported by an implementation.  The
      element is optional.

   For example, a fragment with a <codec> element describing the H263
   codec:

   <codec>
    <subtype>H263</subtype>
   </codec>

5.5.  <params>

   The <params> element is a container for <param> elements
   (Section 5.5.1).

   The <params> element has no attributes, but the following child
   elements are defined (0 or more):

   <param>:  specifies a parameter name and value (Section 5.5.1).

5.5.1.  <param>

   The <param> element describes a parameter name and value.

   The <param> element has the following attributes:

   name:  a string indicating the name of the parameter.  The attribute
      is mandatory.

   type:  specifies a type indicating how the inline value of the
      parameter is to be interpreted.  A valid value is a MIME media
      type (see Section 5.7.6).  The attribute is optional.  The default
      value is "text/plain".

   The <param> element content model is the value of the parameter.
   Note that a value which contains XML characters (e.g. "<") needs to
   be escaped following standard XML conventions.

5.6.  Response Status Codes

   This section describes the response codes in Table 1 for the status
   attribute of mixer management <response> (Section 5.2.3) and audit
   <auditresponse> (Section 5.3.2) responses.  The MS MUST support these
   status response codes.  The MS MAY support other response codes.  The
   AS MUST treat any responses it does not recognize as being equivalent
   to the x00 response code for all classes.  For example, if an AS
   receives an unrecognized response code of 499, it can safely assume
   that there was something wrong with its request and treat the
   response as if it had received a 400 (Syntax error) response code.

   4xx responses are definite failure responses from a particular MS.
   The reason attribute in the response SHOULD identify the failure in
   more detail, for example, "Mandatory attribute missing: id2 join
   element" for a 400 (Syntax error) response code.

   The AS SHOULD NOT retry the same request without modification (for
   example, correcting a syntax error or changing the conferenceid to
   use one available on the MS).  However, the same request to a

Internet-Draft            Mixer Control Package            November 2008


   different MS might be successful; for example, if another MS supports
   a capability required in the request.

   4xx failure responses can be grouped into three classes: failure due
   to a syntax error in the request (400); failure due to an error
   executing the request on the MS (405-419); and failure due to the
   request requiring a capability not supported by the MS (420-435).

   In cases where more than one request code could be reported for a
   failure, the MS SHOULD use the most specific error code of the
   failure class for the detected error.  For example, if the MS detects
   that the conference identifier in the request is invalid, then it
   uses a 406 status code.  However, if the MS merely detects that an
   execution error occurred, then 419 is used.

6.  Formal Syntax

   This section defines the XML schema for the Mixer Control Package.

   The schema defines datatypes, attributes, and mixer elements in the
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer namespace.  In most elements the
   order of child elements is significant.  The schema is extensible:
   elements allow attributes and child elements from other namespaces.
   Elements from outside this package's namespace can occur after
   elements defined in this package.

   The schema is dependent upon the schema (framework.xsd) defined in
   Section 17.1 of the Control Framework
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework].

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <xsd:schema targetNamespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer"
    xmlns:fw="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:control:framework-attributes"

      IETF MediaCtrl Mixer 1.0 (20081010)

      This is the schema of the Mixer control package. It
      defines request, response and notification elements for
      mixing.

      The schema namespace is urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer

7.  Examples

   This section provides examples of the Mixer Control package.

7.1.  AS-MS Framework Interaction Examples

   The following example assume a control channel has been established
   and synced as described in the Media Control Channel Framework
   ([I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework]).

   The XML messages are in angled brackets (with the root <mscmixer> and
   other details omitted for clarity); the REPORT status is in round
   brackets.  Other aspects of the protocol are omitted for readability.

7.1.1.  Creating a conference mixer and joining a participant

   A conference mixer is created successfully and a participant is
   joined.

7.2.  Mixing Examples

   The following examples show how the mixing package can be used to
   create audio conferences, bridge connections and video conferences.

   The examples do not specify all messages between the AS and MS.

Internet-Draft            Mixer Control Package            November 2008


7.2.1.  Audio conferencing

   The AS sends a request to create a conference mixer:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <createconference conferenceid="conf1"
     reserved-talkers="2" reserved-listeners="3">
     <audio-mixing type="nbest"/>
     <subscribe>
      <active-talkers-sub interval="5"/>
     </subscribe>
    </createconference>
   </mscmixer>

   The request specifies that the conference is assigned the conference
   id "conf1" and is configured with 2 reserved talkers, 3 reserved
   listener slots, audio mixing policy set to nbest and with active
   talkers notifications set to 5 seconds.

   If the MS is able to create this conference mixer, it sends 200
   response:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <response status="200" reason="conference created"
              conferenceid="conf1"/>
   </mscmixer>

   The AS is now able to join connections to the conference as
   participants.  A participant able to contribute to the audio mix
   would be joined as follows:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <join id1="1536067209~913cd14c" id2="conf1">
     <stream media="audio" direction="sendrecv"/>
    </join>
   </mscmixer>

   If the MS can join the participant 1536067209~913cd14c to the
   conference conf1 with audio in both directions, then it sends a
   successful response:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <response status="200" reason="join successful"/>
   </mscmixer>

   The AS could also join listener-only participants to the conference
   by setting the stream direction to receive only:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <join id1="9936067209~914cd14c" id2="conf1">
     <stream media="audio" direction="recvonly"/>
    </join>
   </mscmixer>

   If the MS can join the participant 9936067209~914cd14c to the
   conference conf1 then it would send a successful response (not
   shown).

   As the active talker changes, the MS sends an active talker
   notification to the AS:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <event>
     <active-talker-notify conferenceid="conf1">
      <active-talker connectionid="1536067209~913cd14c"/>
     </active-talker-notify>
    </event>
   </mscmixer>

   The AS could decide to change the status of a talker connection so
   that they can only listen:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <modifyjoin id1="1536067209~913cd14c" id2="conf1">
     <stream media="audio" direction="recvonly"/>
    </modifyjoin>
   </mscmixer>

   Where the participant 1536067209~913cd14c is no longer able to
   contribute to the audio mix on the conference.  If the MS is able to
   execute this request, it would send a 200 response.

   The AS could decide to remove this participant from the conference:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <unjoin id1="1536067209~913cd14c" id2="conf1"/>
   </mscmixer>

   Again, if the MS can execute this request, a 200 response would be
   sent.

   Finally, the AS terminates the conference:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <destroyconference conferenceid="conf1"/>
   </mscmixer>

Internet-Draft            Mixer Control Package            November 2008


   If the MS is able to destroy the conference conf1, it sends a 200
   response:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <response status="200" conferenceid="conf1"/>
   </mscmixer>

   For each participant attached to the conference when it is destroyed,
   the MS sends an unjoin notification event:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <event>
     <unjoin-notify status="1" id1="9936067209~914cd14c"
         id2="conf1"/>
    </event>
   </mscmixer>

   And the MS sends a conferenceexit notification event when the
   conference finally exits:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <event>
     <conferenceexit status="1" conferenceid="conf1"/>
    </event>
   </mscmixer>

7.2.2.  Bridging connections

   The mixer package may be used to join connections to one another.  In
   a call center scenario, for example, this package can be used to set
   up and modify connections between a caller, agent and supervisor.

   A caller is joined to an agent with bi-directional audio:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <join id1="caller~001" id2="agent~002">
     <stream media="audio" direction="sendrecv"/>
    </join>
   </mscmixer>

   If the MS is able to establish this connection, then it would send a
   200 response:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <response status="200"/>
   </mscmixer>

   Now assume that the AS wants a supervisor to listen into the agent



Melanchuk, et al.          Expires May 7, 2009                 [Page 75]

Internet-Draft            Mixer Control Package            November 2008


   conversation with the caller and provide whsipered guidance to the
   agent.  First the AS would send a request to join the supervisor and
   the caller connections:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <join  id1="supervisor~003" id2="caller~001">
     <stream media="audio" direction="recvonly"/>
    </join>
   </mscmixer>

   If this request was successful, audio output from the caller
   connection would now be sent to both the agent and the supervisor.

   Second, the AS would send a request to join the supervisor and the
   agent connections:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <join id1="supervisor~001" id2="agent~002">
     <stream media="audio" direction="sendrecv"/>
    </join>
   </mscmixer>

   If this request was successful, the audio mixing would occur on both
   the agent and supervisor connections: the agent would hear the caller
   and supervisor, and the supervisor would hear the agent and caller.
   The caller would only hear the agent.  If the MS is unable to join
   and mix connections in this way, it would send a 426 response.

7.2.3.  Video conferencing

   In this example, an audio video-conference is created with the
   loudest participant has the most prominent region in the video
   layout.

   The AS sends a request to create an audio-video conference:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <createconference conferenceid="conf2">
     <audio-mixing type="nbest"/>
     <video-switch type="vas"/>
     <video-layouts>
      <video-layout min-participants="1">single-view</video-layout>
      <video-layout min-participants="2">dual-view</video-layout>
      <video-layout min-participants="3">quad-view</video-layout>
      <video-layout min-participants="5">multiple-5x1</video-layout>
     </video-layouts>
    </createconference>
   </mscmixer>



Melanchuk, et al.          Expires May 7, 2009                 [Page 76]

Internet-Draft            Mixer Control Package            November 2008


   In this configuration, the conference uses a nbest audio mixing
   policy and a vas video switch policy, so that the loudest speaker
   receives the most prominent region in the layout.  Multiple video
   layouts are specified and active one depends on the number of
   participants.

   Assume that 4 participants are already joined to the conference.  In
   that case, the video layout will be quad-view (Figure 6) with the
   most active speaker displayed in region 1.  When a fifth participant
   joins, the video layout automatically switches to a multiple-5x1
   layout (Figure 9), again with the most active speaker in region 1.

   The AS can manipulate which participants are displayed in the
   remaining regions.  For example, it could force an existing
   conference participant to be displayed in region 2:

   <mscmixer version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-mixer">
    <modifyjoin id1="1536067209~913cd14c" id2="conf2">
     <stream media="video">
      <region>2</region>
     </stream>
    </modifyjoin>
   </mscmixer>

8.  Security Considerations

   As this control package processes XML markup, implementations MUST
   address the security considerations of [RFC3023].

   As a Control Package of the Media Control Channel Framework,
   security, confidentiality and integrity of messages transported over
   the control channel MUST be addressed as described in Section 11 of
   the Media Control channel Framework
   ([I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework]), including Session
   Establishment, Transport Level Protection and Control Channel Policy
   Management.

   The Media Control Channel Framework permits additional policy
   management, including resource access and control channel usage, to
   be specified at the control package level beyond that specified for
   the Media Control Channel Framework (see Section 11.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework]).

   Since creation of conferences and other mixers is associated with
   media mixing resources on the MS, policy management for this control
   package MUST address how such mixers are managed across multiple
   control channels.  This includes which channels are used to deliver
   mixer event notifications, and whether channels are permitted to
   originate requests managing a mixer which was not created through
   that channel (e.g. a conference mixer has been created via channel X
   and a request to terminate the conference, or join a participant,
   originates from channel Y).

   o  Section 4: Aligned Control Package definitions with requirements
      in Section 8 of the Control Framework.

   o  Following October Interim meeting discussion on response codes,
      generally clarified usage of error status codes, modified some
      codes and re-organized the response codes section (Section 5.6)
      with more guidance and details.

   o  MIXER-006.  No action required following October 2008 interim
      discussion.

      "inactive" direction value indicates the stream is established but
      there is no media flow.  Such a stream can be manipulated by
      <modifyjoin> and <unjoin>.

   o  5.2.2.5: <stream>: Clarified that the media stream specified in
      child elements <volume>, <clamp>, <region> and <priority> is the
      stream originating from the entity identified as id1.

      <stream> specifies a region which is not defined for the currently
      active video layout.

   o  5.2.1.4.2.1: <video-layout>: Added descriptions and ASCII art for
      layout and regions of XCON video layouts.

      attributes.  The MS send a 427 error response if it encounters
      foreign elements and attributes it does not support.

   o  5.2.1.4.3: <video-switch>.  Clarified that the VAS policy is
      implementation-specific if a participant provides more than one
      audio stream.

   o  5.2.2.2/5.2.2.3/5.2.2.4: Clarified that joining behavior so that
      streams which have previously been <modifiedjoin>ed or <unjoin>ed
