1. Introduction 

   This document describes how DHT overlay peers get the topology 
   information and reduce the mismatch by traceroute and 2-Means 
   classification. In particular, an assumption is made about the 
   infrastructure routers support peers' traceroute requests, no matter 
   what specific means(ICMP traceroute or TCP traceroute).This operation 
   is reasonable for ISP in its network when it builds up a P2P overlay 
   and provides measurement services for themselves or for clients which 
   are defined in P2P SIP[3]. 

   In a P2P system, each end node provides services to other 
   participating nodes as well as receives services from them. An 
   attractive feature of P2P is that peers do not need to directly 
   interact with the underlying physical network, providing many new 
   opportunities for user-level development and applications. 
   Nevertheless, the mechanism for a peer to randomly choose logical 
   neighbors, without any knowledge about the physical topology, causes

   a serious topology mismatch between the P2P overlay networks and the 
   physical networks. 

   The mismatch between physical topologies and logical overlays is a 
   major factor that delays the lookup response time, which is 
   determined by the product of the routing hops and the link latencies. 
   Mismatch problem also causes a large volume of redundant traffic in 
   inter-domain between the every ISP. These has constituted the 
   motivation to the topology-aware P2P, which implies to mitigate such 
   drawbacks. 

   The purpose of this document is to specify a way to efficient 
   topology matching technique. The DHT overlay peers' Traceroute result 
   are used to get "near" clusters and Edge Gateway by execute 2-Means 
   classification. This information will be put into the DHT. Two peers 
   will be considered as to hava a close neighbor relationship, if they 
   have at least one coomon router among their "near" clusters and Edge 
   Gateways.

   This section defines some key concepts using in this document. 

   DHT  - distributed hash table (DHT). 

   DHT Overlay :  An overlay network is a computer network which is 
   built on top of another network. The peer-to-peer networks are 
   overlay networks because they run on top of the Internet. And the 
   peer-to-peer network which builds with DHT is DHT Overlay.  

   2-means classification: k-means classification is an algorithm to 
   classify objects based on their attributes into K number of group.2-
   means classification algorithm is a special example of k-means 
   classification algorithm with k=2. 

2. Overview 

   Usually, to solve the mismatch problem, it needs three steps, first 
   to estimate the physical network distance between two overlay peers 
   through network probing or prediction. then,  based on this proximity 
   information , to cluster "near" peers, so as to let peers can find a 
   better candidate than the randomly chosen result. At last, such

   results are utilized to optimize P2P alogrithm. The "near" peers are 
   the preferential choice in P2P lookup and maintenance, and these will 
   impel the access and traffic localization and reduce delay.

              Figure 1 Basic Steps of P2P Traffic Localization 

   In this document, an efficient topology matching technique is 
   specified. First, before a peer joining the P2P networks, it randomly 
   picks an Internet IP address and probes it using the traceroute tools. 
   According to the measured data, the peer tracks the return 
   information to a vector data. Then 2-means classification algorithm 
   is used to classify the Internet routers into "near" and "remote" 
   routers. Finally, peer chooses the router with maximum Hops item in 
   "near" set as a the Edge Gateway. The peer registers into the DHT 
   overlays with the Edge Gateway the Key, then do same to the "near" 
   set. Through shared vector cluster information such as "near" routers 
   cluster and Edge Gateway, two peers were considered as a close 
   neighbor relationship when their "near" routers cluster both had a 
   same router's IP address at least and then gathered together to form 
   a "close" peer clusters. 

3. Traceroute and Clustering 

3.1. Peer Traceroute 

    As a rapid developed network, the Internet presents two kinds of 
    basic characteristic. On one hand, with many end user hosts randomly 
    join and leave the network, the topology of Internet is dynamic and 
    variable,  but the routers constitute a much more stable 
    infrastructure topology. On the other hand, regarding Internet as a 
    graph (V=routers, E=direct link between routers), we found that the 
    edges between ASes constitutes a very small portion among the total 
    edges, and usually the delay between ISP routers is more large than 
    the delay between routers in the same AS domains. A peer need 
    randomly picked an Internet IP address and probed it using the 
    traceroute tools.  The peer tracked the return information to a 
    vector data, with the data structure <IP, Hops, Latency>.

              Fig.2 The Traceroute Result 

   Fig.2 is an example of path information by R1 traceroute to R8. As is 
   clear from Fig.2, between the R3 and R4, R5 and R6, there are some 
   huge latency leaps than the others. It possibly means that traceroute 
   message across the different AS domains or different ISP ranges.      

3.2. 2-Means Classification 

   When the overlay peer gets the traceroute result through randomly 
   probe, a 2-means classification algorithm is used to classify the 
   Internet routers based on the Latency attribute in these traceroute 
   result. The 2-means classification algorithm includes four steps as 
   following[2]: 

       step1. Peer chooses the minimum latency item and maximum latency 
               item in whole vectors as centroids for two initialization 
               sets "first"  and "second".  

       As a example in Fig.2, <R1, 1, 5ms> and <R5, 5, 150ms> is 
       selected as centroids for sets "first" and "second". 

       step2. Peer takes the latency item in vector to make an absolute 
               distance value with two centroids in turn, and then 
               separately associated the corresponding vector to one 
               vector cluster that has smaller absolute distance value.  

       So for the Fig2. example, the vector of R2 is <R2, 2, 10ms>, and 
        the distance between R2 and R1 is 10-5 = 5, and the distance 
        between R2 and R5 is 150-10 = 140. So <R2, 2, 10ms> belongs to 
        the "first" set. 

        step3. Peer calculates the latency mean and variance value of 
               two vector clusters. 

        As in in Fig.2, the R1,R2,R4,R6,R7 belong to the "first" set, 
        and R3,R5 belong to the "second" set and the mean and variance 
        can be calculated. 

        step4. If the variance value was larger than the threshold, peer 
        picks two latency mean values as new centroids of "first" and 
        "second" sets, then goto step2, otherwise finishs the 
        classification and gets two "first" and "second" sets. 

 
 
Wen&Zhang              Expires January 4, 2009                [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft P2P Traffic Localization by Traceroute        July 2008 
    

        Finally, peer chooses the router with minimum Hops item in 
        "second" set as a hop threshold. This router and the other 
        routers whose Hops item are larger than the hop threshold all 
        divided into a "remote" router cluster. And then the remaining 
        routers are gathered into another "near" cluster. and the router 
        with maximum hops of the "near" cluster is regarded as overlay 
        peer's Edge Gateway. 

        So for the Fig.2 example, R1,R2,R3 are the "near" routers of 
        overlay peer and others routers are the "remoter" routers of the 
        overlay peer. R3 will be the Edge Gateway in this case. 

3.3. Form the Cluster 

   The peer registers into the P2P overlays with their Edge Gateway and 
   "near" routers as the Key, and the DHT ID and IP of itself as the 
   value.Due to the essence of DHT, if two item have the same Key,they 
   will be routed to the same DHT peer. Thus it makes possible to let 
   several peers to know each other, if they have some common elements 
   of their "near" router set. Edge Gateway is more useful, so if the 
   hosting DHT peers become overloaded, it will firstly deletes such non 
   Edge Gateway routers item. The hosting DHT peer will notify those 
   peers to form a "close" cluster, or join an existed cluster. 

   Each peer clusters has a ClusterId generated by consistent hashing 
   when the first two peers decided to form the cluster. The ClusterId 
   and its member peer Ids will be PUT into the DHT, and the peer can 
   find the other members within the same cluster by DHT GET with its 
   ClusterId remembered during its last online life. 

3.4. Update 

   During normal peer-to-peer interactions such as DHT lookup or 
   maintenance, if peers belonging to different clusters found the delay 
   between them were relatively low, then these two clusters should 
   decide to combine a new bigger cluster. The mapping between those 
   original ClusterIds and the new generated ClusterIds should also be 
   registered into the DHT so as to let those peers belonging to old 
   clusters could find and join the new cluster. This technique 
   alleviates the problem occurred when peers belonging to same cluster 
   get different Edge Gateways from their traceroute response,thus they 
   can not form the ideal bigger cluster.

4. Enhancement Examples 

4.1. Find the proximate candidates 

   Peers register their resources to be shared as <Key, Value> pairs 
   into the DHT. Usually the Key is generated by consistent hashing some 
   information like the file name, and the Value is the IP address  of 
   the sharing peer. When use our scheme, we will also include the 
   sharing peer's ClusterID in the Value. 

   When a overlay peer wants to find a resource, it will raise a DHT get 
   with the hashed Key and piggyback its ClusterID.  When getting the 
   request, the peer hosting the Key k will check the list of 
   <Key,Value> pairs registered by all the sharing candidates, then it 
   will choose the sharing peer with the same ClusterId to be the 
   preference result. 

4.2. More Efficient Overlay Routing  

   The delay between the ISP is larger more than the inner-domain 
   delay.And if AS domain is big enough many resource can be found in 
   the same AS domains. So a more efficient hierarchical P2P network is 
   feasible. Each low layer (local) DHT is composed by the peers with 
   same ClusterID. All the peers or some candidate peers from each local 
   DHT will join the global DHT. Every peer firstly search in its local 
   DHT for its desired resource, then it may switched to the global DHT 
   only if the resource not available locally.  

4.3. Placement of Cache 

   In order to reduce the inter-domain traffic and delay, cache is 
   always considered in the P2P network. The placement strategy takes 
   the cluster info into account. It will place caches to cover the peer 
   clusters in the order of its population, the number of peers 
   participating the cluster.

7. Conclusions 

   This document describes how DHT overlay peers can interact with the 
   routers by traceroute to get the path information, and execute 2-
   Means Classification, thereafter peers leverage the DHT itself to 
   build efficient "closer" cluster. This scheme only requires the 
   infrastructure to enable traceroute queries.
