                    draft-zhao-lisp-mn-extension-01

Abstract

   The lisp-MN describes how a lightweight version of LISP's ITR/ETR
   functionality can be used to provide seamless mobility to a mobile
   node.  The LISP Mobile Node extension design described in this
   document uses standard LISP functionality to provide scalable
   mobility for LISP mobile nodes.  This document extends the lisp-MN,
   it introduces some contents that lisp-MN does not include but the
   author think it is important and recommendation them to be considered
   in the lisp-MN.

Internet-Draft         LISP Mobile Node extension              July 2011


1.  Introduction

   The lisp-MN specifies the behavior of the LISP Mobile Node.  It has
   introduced some aspects of lisp-MN, but there are some other
   important areas have not considered.

   o  The EID-to-RLOC mapping update operation has not be considered.
      When a LISP-MN roams onto a new network, it receives a new RLOC,
      the lisp-MN Map-Registers it's new RLOC toin its configured Map-
      Server, then the lisp-MN sends packet to its peer side by the new
      RLOC.  But before the peer side receives the packet the lisp-MN
      sent, the peer side will send packet to lisp-MN by the old RLOC or
      the peer side must query the MS to obtain the lisp-MN's RLOC and
      then the peer side updates its cache of the EID-to-RLOC mapping
      and send packet by the new RLOC, this will cause a problem, the
      packet the lisp-MN to receive from its peer side will be missed or
      delayed when the LISP-MN roams onto a new network.  So how to
      update the previous EID-to-RLOC mapping cached in the lisp-MN's
      peer side must be considered.

   o  The deregister have not be considered.When the lisp-MN is shutdown
      or the user initiates to interrupt the network connection or the
      contract is limited, the lisp-MN needn't continue attach to the
      network, the lisp-MN will initiate the process of the Map-
      Unregister.

   This document specifies the LISP-MN extension operation, which
   includes these two aspects, the EID-to-RLOC Mapping Update Operation
   and the Map-Unregister Operation.

   Design goals for the LISP-MN extension design include:

   o  The LISP-MN extension design described in this document based on
      the Lisp-MN, this document does not change any contents of the
      LISP-MN.

   o  The LISP-MN extension design described in this document uses
      standard LISP-MN functionality.

   o  This document only do some extension of the lisp-MN and only
      introduces the contents the author think must be supplemented to
      the lisp-MN .

   o  The LISP-MN extension design is built from the existing LISP
      components: the LISP-MN, and the its corresponding side in
      communication ,and the existing Map-Server [LISP-MS] and the
      Interworking [LISP-INTERWORK] infrastructures.

2.  Terminology

   This section defines the terms used in this document.

   LISP Mobile Node (LISP-MN): A LISP capable fast roaming mobile hand-
   set.

   Endpoint ID (EID): This is the traditional LISP EID [LISP], and is
   the address that a LISP mobile node uses as its address for transport
   connections.  A LISP mobile node never changes its EID, which is
   typically a /32 or /128 prefix and is assigned to a loopback
   interface.  Note that the mobile node can have multiple EIDs, and
   these EIDs can be from different address families.

   Routing Locator (RLOC): This is the traditional LISP RLOC, and is in
   general a routable address that can be used to reach a mobile node.
   Note that there are cases in which an mobile node may receive an
   address that it thinks is an RLOC (perhaps via DHCP) which is either
   an EID or an RFC 1918 address [RFC1918][RFC1918].  This could happen
   if, for example, if the mobile node roams into a LISP domain or a
   domain behind a Network Address Translator (NAT).

   Map-cache: A data structure which contains an EID-prefix, its
   associated RLOCs, and the associated policy.  Map-caches are
   typically found in ITRs and PITRs.

   Map Update: A Map update is the lisp-MN notifies the correspondent to
   change the EID-to-RLOC mapping when the lisp-MN move to another
   location in the communication process.

   Map Unregister: A Map Unregister is the lisp-MN notifies the
   MS[LISP-Map-Server] to unbind the EID-to-RLOC mapping when the
   lisp-MN needn't to attached to the network.

3.  LISP-MN Extension Operation

   The LISP-MN Extension Operation described in this document uses the
   LISP-MN and its configured Map-Server to provide scalable fast
   mobility and the Map-Unregister operation.

3.1.   EID-to-RLOC Mapping Update Operation

   This section provides the EID-to-RLOC mapping update operation.
   After a roaming event, a LISP-MN must immediately register its new
   EID-to-RLOC mapping with its configured Map-Server(s).  In addition,
   the Lisp-MN sends the EID-to-RLOC mapping update request to its peer
   side to inform the peer side the LISP-MN which is ongoing
   communication has moved to a new location and the Lisp-MN has
   received a new RLOC, the EID-to-RLOC mapping update request message
   carries the EID and the new RLOC of the Lisp-MN.  After received the
   EID-to-RLOC mapping update request, the peer side updates the EID-to-
   RLOC mapping cached in its local, that is in the local cache use the
   new RLOC instead of the old RLOC in the EID-to-RLOC mapping, then the
   peer side returns he EID-to-RLOC mapping update response (Update
   Response) message to the lisp-MN.  The EID-to-RLOC mapping update
   operation improves the efficiency of data transmission and decreases
   the occurrence of packet latency and packet loss when a roaming event
   occurs in communication .

3.2.  Map-Unregister Operation

   When the lisp-MN is shutdown or the user initiates to interrupt the
   network connection or the contract is limited , the lisp-MN needn't
   continue register to the network, the lisp-MN will initiate the
   process of the Map-Unregister.

   The lisp-MN sends a map-unregister to its configured Map-Server(s) to
   delete the EID-to-RLOC mapping stored in this MS.

   After received the Map-Unregister Request, the MS removes the EID-to-
   RLOC mapping stored in it and sends the Map-Unregister response to
   the lisp-MN, the message in this process carries the instructions
   indicates the success or failure of the Map-Unregister operation.
   The Map-Unregister process is completed.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security for the LISP-MN design builds upon the security fundamentals
   found in LISP [LISP] for data-plane security and the LISP Map Server
   [LISP-MS] registration security.  Security issues unique to the
   LISP-MN design are considered below.
