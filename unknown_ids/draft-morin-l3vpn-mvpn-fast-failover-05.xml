      <t>This document defines multicast VPN extensions and procedures that
      allow fast failover for upstream failures, by allowing downstream PEs to
      take into account the status of Provider-Tunnels (P-tunnels) when
      selecting the upstream PE for a VPN multicast flow, and extending BGP
      MVPN routing so that a C-multicast route can be advertized toward a
      standby upstream PE.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In the context of multicast in BGP/MPLS VPNs, it is desirable to
      provide mechanisms allowing fast recovery of connectivity on different
      types of failures. This document addresses failures of elements in the
      provider network that are upstream of PEs connected to VPN sites with
      receivers.</t>

      <t>The sections <xref format="counter" target="tunnel-status"/>
      and <xref format="counter" target="standby-join"/> describe two
      independent mechanisms, allowing different levels of resiliency, and
      providing different failure coverage:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Section <xref format="counter" target="tunnel-status"/>
          describes local procedures allowing an egress PE (a PE connected to
          a receiver site) to take into account the status of P-Tunnels to
          determine the Upstream Multicast Hop (UMH) for a given (C-S,
          C-G).</t>

          <t>Section <xref format="counter" target="standby-join"/>
          describes protocol extensions that can speed up failover by not
          requiring any multicast VPN routing message exchange at recovery
          time.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Moreover, section <xref format="counter" target="hot-standby"/>
      describes a "hot leaf standby" mechanism, that uses a combination of
      these two mechanisms. This approach has similarities with the solution
      described in <xref target="I-D.karan-mofrr"/> to improve failover
      times when PIM routing is used in a network given some topology and
      metric constraints.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The terminology used in this document is the terminology defined in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast-bgp"> </xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="tunnel-status" title="UMH Selection based on tunnel status">
      <t>Current <xref target="I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast">multicast VPN
      specifications</xref>, section 5.1, describe the procedures used by a
      multicast VPN downstream PE to determine what the upstream multicast hop
      (UMH) is for a said (C-S,C-G).</t>

      <t>The procedure described here is an OPTIONAL procedure that consist in
      having a downstream PE take into account the status of P-tunnels rooted
      at each possible upstream PEs, for including or not including each said
      PE in the list of candidate UMHs for a said (C-S,C-G) state. The result
      is that, if a P-tunnel is "down" (see <xref target="tunnel-status-determination"/>), the PE that is the root
      of the P-Tunnel will not be considered for UMH selection, which will
      result in the downstream PE to failover to the upstream PE which is next
      in the list of candidates.</t>

      <t>More precisely, UMH determination for a said (C-S,C-G) will consider
      the UMH candidates in the following order:<list style="symbols">
          <t>first, the UMH candidates that either (a) advertise a PMSI bound
          to a tunnel that is "up", or (b) do not advertise any I- or S- PMSI
          applicable to the said (C-S,C-G) but have associated a VRF Route
          Import BGP attribute to the unicast VPN route for S (this is
          necessary to avoid considering invalid some UMH PEs that use a
          policy where no I-PMSI is advertized for a said VRF and where only
          S-PMSI are used, the S-PMSI advertisement being possibly done only
          after the upstream PE receives a C-multicast route for (C-S,
          C-G)/(C-*, C-G) to be carried over the advertized S-PMSI)</t>

          <t>second, the UMH candidates that advertise a PMSI bound to a
          tunnel that is "down" -- these will thus be used as a last resort to
          ensure a graceful fallback to the basic MVPN UMH selection
          procedures in the hypothetical case where a false negative would
          occur when determining the status of all tunnels</t>
        </list>For a said downstream PE and a said VRF, the P-tunnel
      corresponding to a said upstream PE for a said (C-S,C-G) state is the
      S-PMSI tunnel advertized by that upstream PE for this (C-S,C-G) and
      imported into that VRF, or if there isn't any such S-PMSI, the I-PMSI
      tunnel advertized by that PE and imported into that VRF.</t>

      <t>Note that this documents assumes that if a site of a given MVPN that
      contains C-S is dual-homed to two PEs, then all the other sites of that
      MVPN would have two unicast VPN routes (VPN-IPv4 or VPN-IPv6) routes to
      C-S, each with its own RD.</t>

      <section anchor="tunnel-status-determination" title="Determining the status of a tunnel">
        <t>Different factors can be considered to determine the "status" of a
        P-tunnel and are described in the following sub-sections. The
        procedure proposed here also allows that all downstream PEs don't
        apply the same rules to define what the status of a P-tunnel is
        (please see <xref target="dups"> </xref>), and some of them will
        produce a result that may be different for different downstream PEs.
        Thus what is called the "status" of a P-tunnel in this section, is not
        a characteristic of the tunnel in itself, but is the status of the
        tunnel, <spanx style="strong">as seen from a particular downstream PE</spanx>.</t>

        <t>Depending on the criteria used to determine the status of a
        P-tunnel, there may be an interaction with other resiliency mechanism
        used for the P-tunnel itself, and the UMH update may happen
        immediately or may need to be delayed. Each particular case is covered
        in each separate sub-section below.</t>

        <section title="mVPN tunnel root tracking">
          <t>A condition to consider that the status of a P-tunnel is up is
          that the root of the tunnel, as determined in the PMSI tunnel
          attribute, is reachable through unicast routing tables. In this case
          the downstream PE can immediately update its UMH when the
          reachability condition changes.</t>

          <t>This is similar to BGP next-hop tracking for VPN routes, except
          that the address considered is not the BGP next-hop address, but the
          root address in the PMSI tunnel attribute.</t>

          <t>If BGP next-hop tracking is done for VPN routes, and the root
          address of a said tunnel happens to be the same as the next-hop
          address in the BGP autodiscovery route advertising the tunnel, then
          this mechanisms may be omitted for this tunnel, as it will not bring
          any specific benefit.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="PE-P Upstream link status">
          <t>A condition to consider a tunnel status as up can be that the
          last-hop link of the P-tunnel is up.</t>

          <t>In that case, if the PE can determine that there is no fast
          restoration mechanism (such as <xref target="RFC4090">MPLS
          FRR</xref>) in place for the P-tunnel, it can update the UMH
          immediately. Else, it should wait before updating the UMH, to let
          the P-tunnel restoration mechanism happen. A configurable timer MUST
          be provided for this purpose, and it is recommended to provide a
          reasonable default value for this timer.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="P2MP RSVP-TE tunnels">
          <t>For P-Tunnels of type P2MP MPLS-TE, the status of the P-Tunnel is
          considered up if one or more of the P2MP RSVP-TE LSPs, identified by
          the P-Tunnel Attribute, are in up state. The determination of
          whether a P2MP RSVP-TE LSP is in up state requires Path and Resv
          state for the LSP and is based on procedures in <xref target="RFC4875"/>. In this case the downstream PE can
          immediately update its UMH when the reachability condition
          changes.</t>

          <t>When signaling state for a P2MP TE LSP is removed (e.g. if the
          ingress of the P2MP TE LSP sends a PathTear message) or the P2MP TE
          LSP changes state from up to down as determined by procedures in
          <xref target="RFC4875"/>, the status of the corresponding
          P-Tunnel SHOULD be re-evaluated. If the P-Tunnel transitions from up
          to down state, the upstream PE, that is the ingress of the P-Tunnel,
          SHOULD not be considered a valid UMH.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Leaf-initiated P-tunnels">
          <t>A PE can be removed from the UMH candidate list for a said (S,G)
          if the P-tunnel for this S,G (I or S , depending) is leaf triggered
          (PIM, mLDP), but for some reason internal to the protocol the
          upstream one-hop branch of the tunnel from P to PE cannot be built.
          In this case the downstream PE can immediately update its UMH when
          the reachability condition changes.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="P2MP LSP OAM">
          <t>When a P2MP connectivity verification mechanism such as <xref target="I-D.katz-ward-bfd-multipoint"/> used in conjunction
          with bootstrapping mechanisms described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-mcast-cv"/> has been setup for a tunnel,
          the result of the connectivity verification can be used to define
          the status of the tree.</t>

          <t>If a MultipointHead session has been established on a P2MP MPLS
          LSP so that BFD packets are periodically sent from the root toward
          leaves, a condition to consider the status of corresponding tunnel
          as up is that the BFD SessionState is Up.</t>

          <t>When such a procedure is used, in context where fast restoration
          mechanisms are used for the P-tunnels, downstream PEs should be
          configured to wait before updating the UMH, to let the P-tunnel
          restoration mechanism happen. A configurable timer MUST be provided
          for this purpose, and it is recommended to provide a reasonable
          default value for this timer.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="(S,G) counter information">
          <t>In cases, where the downstream node can be configured so that the
          maximum inter-packet time is known for all the multicast flows
          mapped on a P-tunnel, the local per-(C-S,C-G) traffic counter
          information for traffic received on this P-tunnel can be used to
          determine the status of the P-tunnel.</t>

          <t>When such a procedure is used, in context where fast restoration
          mechanisms are used for the P-tunnels, downstream PEs should be
          configured to wait before updating the UMH, to let the P-tunnel
          restoration mechanism happen. A configurable timer MUST be provided
          for this purpose, and it is recommended to provide a reasonable
          default value for this timer.</t>

          <t>This method can be applicable for instance when a (S,G) flow is
          mapped on an S-PMSI.</t>

          <t>In cases where this mechanism is used in conjunction with <xref format="title" target="hot-standby"/>, then no prior knowledge
          of the rate of the multicast streams is required ; downstream PEs
          can compare reception on the two P-tunnels to determine when one of
          them is down.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="standby-join" title="Standby C-multicast route">
      <t>The procedures described below are limited to the case where the site
      that contains C-S is connected to exactly two PEs. The procedures
      require all the PEs of that MVPN to follow the single forwarder PE
      selection, as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast"/>. The procedures assume
      that if a site of a given MVPN that contains C-S is dual-homed to two
      PEs, then all the other sites of that MVPN would have two unicast VPN
      routes (VPN-IPv4 or VPN-IPv6) routes to C-S, each with its own RD.</t>

      <t>As long as C-S is reachable via both PEs, a said downstream PE will
      select one of the PEs connected to C-S as its Upstream PE with respect
      to C-S. We will refer to the other PE connected to C-S as the "Standby
      Upstream PE". Note that if the connectivity to C-S through the Primary
      Upstream PE becomes unavailable, then the PE will select the Standby
      Upstream PE as its Upstream PE with respect to C-S.</t>

      <t>For readability, in the following sub-sections, the procedures are
      described for BGP C-multicast Source Tree Join routes, but they apply
      equally to BGP C-multicast Shared Tree Join routes failover for the case
      where the customer RP is dual-homed (substitute "C-RP" to "C-S").</t>

      <section anchor="ds-behavior" title="Downstream PE behavior">
        <t>When a (downstream) PE connected to some site of an MVPN needs to
        send a C-multicast route (C-S, C-G), then following the procedures
        specified in Section "Originating C-multicast routes by a PE" of <xref target="I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast-bgp"/> the PE sends the
        C-multicast route with RT that identifies the Upstream PE selected by
        the PE originating the route. As long as C-S is reachable via the
        Primary Upstream PE, the Upstream PE is the Primary Upstream PE. If
        C-S is reachable only via the Standby Upstream PE, then the Upstream
        PE is the Standby Upstream PE.</t>

        <t>If C-S is reachable via both the Primary and the Standby Upstream
        PE, then in addition to sending the C-multicast route with an RT that
        identifies the Primary Upstream PE, the PE also originates and sends a
        C-multicast route with an RT that identifies the Standby Upstream PE.
        This route, that has the semantic of being a 'standby' C-multicast
        route, is further called a "Standby BGP C-multicast route", and is
        constructed as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>the NLRI is constructed as the original C-multicast route,
            except that the RD is the same as if the C-multicast route was
            built using the standby PE as the UMH (it will carry the RD
            associated to the unicast VPN route advertized by the standby PE
            for S)</t>

            <t>MUST carry the "Standby PE" BGP Community (this is a new BGP
            Community, see <xref target="IANA"/>)</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The normal and the standby C-multicast routes must have their Local
        Preference attribute adjusted so that, if two C-multicast routes with
        same NLRI are received by a BGP peer, one carrying the "Standby PE"
        attribute and the other one <spanx style="strong">not</spanx> carrying
        the "Standby PE" community, then preference is given to the one <spanx style="strong">not</spanx> carrying the "Standby PE" attribute. Such a
        situation can happen when, for instance due to transient unicast
        routing inconsistencies, two different downstream PEs consider
        different upstream PEs to be the primary one ; in that case, without
        any precaution taken, both upstream PEs would process a standby
        C-multicast route and possibly stop forwarding at the same time. For
        this purpose a Standby BGP C-multicast route MUST have the LOCAL_PREF
        attribute set to zero.</t>

        <t>Note that, when a PE advertizes such a Standby C-multicast join for
        an (S,G) it must join the corresponding P-tunnel.</t>

        <t>If at some later point the local PE determines that C-S is no
        longer reachable through the Primary Upstream PE, the Standby Upstream
        PE becomes the Upstream PE, and the local PE re-sends the C-multicast
        route with RT that identifies the Standby Upstream PE, except that now
        the route does not carry the Standby PE BGP Community (which results
        in replacing the old route with a new route, with the only difference
        between these routes being the presence/absence of the Standby PE BGP
        Community).</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="us-behavior" title="Upstream PE behavior">
        <t>When a PE receives a C-multicast route for a particular (C-S, C-G),
        and the RT carried in the route results in importing the route into a
        particular VRF on the PE, if the route carries the Standby PE BGP
        Community, then the PE performs as follows: <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="">when the PE determines that C-S is not reachable

            will be that a PIM Join message will be sent to the CE towards

            SHOULD forward (C-S, C-G) traffic received by the PE to other PEs
            through a P-tunnel rooted at the PE.</t>
          </list></t>

      <t>The mechanisms defined in sections <xref target="standby-join"/> and <xref target="tunnel-status"/>
      can be used together as follows.</t>

      <t>The principle is that, for a said VRF (or possibly only for a said

          <t>downstream PEs advertise a Standby BGP C-multicast route (based

          <t>upstream PEs use the "hot standby" optional behavior and thus
          will forward traffic for a said multicast state as soon as they have
          whether a (primary) BGP C-multicast route or a Standby BGP
          C-multicast route for that state (or both)</t>

          <t>downstream PEs accept traffic from the primary or standby tunnel,
          based on the status of the tunnel (based on <xref target="tunnel-status"/>)</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Other combinations of the mechanisms proposed in <xref target="standby-join"/>) and <xref target="tunnel-status"/>
      are for further study.</t>

      <t>Note that the same level of protection would be achievable with a
      simple C-multicast Source Tree Join route advertized to both the primary
      and secondary upstream PEs (carrying as Route Target extended
      communities, the values of the VRF Route Import attribute of each VPN
      route from each upstream PEs). The advantage of using the Standby
      semantic for is that, supposing that downstream PEs always advertise a
      Standby C-multicast route to the secondary upstream PE, it allows to
      choose the protection level through a change of configuration on the
      secondary upstream PE, without requiring any reconfiguration of all the
      downstream PEs.</t>

      coming from the expected usptream PE (Section 9.1).</t>

      <t>We highlight the reader's attention to the fact that the respect of
      this part of multicast VPN specifications is especially important when
      two distinct upstream PEs are susceptible to forward the same traffic on
      P-tunnels at the same time in steady state. This will be the case when
      "hot root standby" mode is used (<xref target="standby-join"/>),
      and which can also be the case if procedures of <xref target="tunnel-status"/> are used and (a) the rules determining
      the status of a tree are not the same on two distinct downstream PEs or
      (b) the rule determining the status of a tree depend on conditions local
      to a PE (e.g. the PE-P upstream link being up).</t>

<abstract>
<t>This document defines RSVP-TE extensions to establish backup label-switched path (LSP) tunnels for local repair of LSP tunnels. These mechanisms enable the re-direction of traffic onto backup LSP tunnels in 10s of milliseconds, in the event of a failure.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; Two methods are defined here. The one-to-one backup method creates detour LSPs for each protected LSP at each potential point of local repair. The facility backup method creates a bypass tunnel to protect a potential failure point; by taking advantage of MPLS label stacking, this bypass tunnel can protect a set of LSPs that have similar backup constraints. Both methods can be used to protect links and nodes during network failure. The described behavior and extensions to RSVP allow nodes to implement either method or both and to interoperate in a mixed network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>
