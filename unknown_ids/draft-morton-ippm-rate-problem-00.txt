                   draft-morton-ippm-rate-problem-00

Abstract

   There is a rate measurement scenario which has wide-spread attention
   of users and seemingly all industry participants, including
   regulators.  This memo presents an access rate-measurement problem
   statement for IP Performance Metrics.  Key aspects require the
   ability to control packet size on the tested path and enable
   asymmetrical packet size testing in a controller-responder
   architecture.

Internet-Draft           Rate Problem Statement             October 2011


1.  Introduction

   There are many possible rate measurement scenarios.  This memo
   describes one rate measurement problem and presents a rate-
   measurement problem statement for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM).

   The access-rate scenario or use case has wide-spread attention of
   users and seemingly all industry participants, including regulators.
   It is being approached with many different measurement methods.


2.  Purpose and Scope

   The scope and purpose of this memo is to define the measurement
   problem statement for access rate measurement.  We characterize this
   scenario as follows:

   o  Rates at the edge of the network are several orders of magnitude
      less than aggregation and core portions.

   o  Asymmetrical ingress and egress rates are prevalent.

   o  Extremely large scale of access services requires low complexity
      devices participating at the user end of the path.

   Today, the majority of widely deployed access services achieve rates
   less than 100 Mbit/s, and this is the rate-regime for which a
   solution is sought now.

   This problem statement assumes that the bottleneck device or link is
   adjacent to the remote (user-end) measurement device, or is within
   one or two router/switch hops of the remote measurement device.

   Only active measurement methods will be addressed here, consistent
   with the IPPM working group's current charter.  Active measurements
   require synthetic traffic dedicated to testing, and do not use user
   traffic.

   It is a non-goal to solve the problem in this memo.


3.  Active Rate Measurement

   This section lists features of active measurement methods needed to
   measure access rates in production networks.

   Test coordination between Src and Dst devices through control
   messages, and other basic capabilities described in the methods of

   IPPM RFCs [RFC2679][RFC2680] are taken as given (these could be
   listed later, if desired).

   One key tenant of IPPM methods is to minimize test traffic affects on
   user traffic in the production network.  Section 5 of [RFC2680] lists
   the problems with high measurement traffic rates, and the most
   relevant for rate measurement is the tendency for measurement traffic
   to skew the results, followed by the possibility to introduce
   congestion on the access link.  Obviously, methods that use less
   active test traffic than others with similar accuracy SHALL be
   preferred.

   The measurement architecture MAY be either of one-way (e.g.,
   [RFC4656]) or two-way (e.g., [RFC5357]), but the scale and complexity
   aspects of end-user access measurement clearly favor two-way.
   However, the asymmetric rates of many access services means that the
   measurement system MUST be able to assess each direction of
   transmission separately.  In the two-way architecture, it is expected
   that both directions of transmission MAY affect the ability to launch
   streams or collect the results of measurements (this has always been
   true, it is not a unique problem for rate measurements).

   The following paragraphs describe features for the roles of test
   packet SENDER, RECEIVER, and results REPORTER.

   SENDER:

   Ability to generate streams of test packets with various
   characteristics as desired.  The SENDER may be located at the user
   end of the access path, or may be located elsewhere in the production
   network.

   1.  Variable payload lengths among packet streams

   2.  Variable stream length among packet streams

   3.  Variable header markings among packet streams

   4.  others?

   RECEIVER:

   Ability to collect streams of test packets with various
   characteristics (as described above), and make the measurements
   necessary to support rate measurement.

   REPORTER:

   Ability to use information from test packets and local processes to
   measure delivered packet rates.


4.  Test Protocol Control & Generation Requirements

   Essentially, the test protocol MUST support the measurement features
   described in Section 3.  This REQUIRES:

   1.  Communicating all test variables to the Sender and Receiver

   2.  Results collection in a one-way architecture

   3.  Remote device control for a two-way architecture

   4.  Asymmetric and/or pseudo-one-way test capability in a two-way
       measurement architecture


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live networks are relevant here as well.  See [RFC4656] and
   [RFC5357].


6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo makes no requests of IANA.
