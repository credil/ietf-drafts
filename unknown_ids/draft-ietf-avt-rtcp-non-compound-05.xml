      <t>This memo discusses benefits and issues that arise when allowing RTCP
      packets to be transmitted with reduced size such that mandatory report
      types according to the rules outlined in RFC3550 are removed. Based on

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In <xref target="RFC3550">RTP</xref> it is currently mandatory to
      always use RTCP compound packets containing at least Sender Reports or
      Receiver reports, and a SDES packet containing at least the CNAME item.
      There are good reasons for this as discussed below (see <xref
      target="sec-compound-packets"></xref>). However this do result in that
      the minimal RTCP packets are quite large. <vspace />The <xref
      target="RFC4585">RTP profile AVPF</xref> specifies new RTCP packet types
      for feedback messages. Some of these feedback messages would benefit
      from being transmitted with minimal delay and AVPF do provide some
      mechanism to enable this. <vspace />However for environments with
      low-bitrate links this still consumes quite a large amount of resources
      and introduces extra delay in the time it takes to completely send the
      compound packet in the network. There are also other benefits as
      discussed in <xref target="sec-benefitts"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The use of reduced size RTCP is not without issues. This is discussed
      in <xref target="sec-issues"></xref>. These issues needs to be
      considered and are part of the motivation for this document.</t>

      <t>In addition this document proposes how AVPF could be updated to allow
      the transmission of reduced size RTCP in a way that would not
      substantially affect the mechanisms that compound packets provide. The
      connection to AVPF is motivated by the fact that reduced size RTCP is
      mainly intended for event driven feedback purposes and that the AVPF
      early and immediate modes make this possible.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-compound-packets" title="RTCP Compound Packets">
      <t>Section 6.1 in <xref target="RFC3550"></xref> specifies that an RTCP
      packet must be sent as a compound RTCP consisting of at least two
      individual RTCP, first an Sender Report (SR) or Receiver Report (RR),
      followed by additional packets including a mandatory SDES packet
      containing a CNAME Item for the transmitting source identifier (SSRC).
      Below is a short description what these RTCP packet types are used
      for.</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>The sender and receiver reports (see Section 6.4 of <xref
          target="RFC3550"></xref>) provides the RTP session participant with
          the Sender Source Identifier (SSRC) of all RTCP senders. Having all
          participants send these packets periodically allows everyone to
          determine the current number of participants. This information is
          used in the transmission scheduling algorithm. Thus this is
          particularly important for new participants so that they quickly can
          establish a good estimate of the group size. Failure to do this
          would result in RTCP senders consuming too much bandwidth.</t>

          <t>The sender and receiver reports contain some basic statistics
          usable for monitoring of the transport and thus enable adaptation.
          These reports become more useful if sent regularly as the receiver
          of a report can perform analysis to find trends between the
          individual reports. When used for media transmission adaptation the
          information become more useful the more frequently it is received,
          at least until one report per round-trip time (RTT) is achieved.
          Therefore there are, in most cases, no reason to not include the
          sender or receiver report in all RTCP packets.</t>

          <t>The CNAME SDES item (See Section 6.5.1 of <xref
          target="RFC3550"></xref>) exists to allow receivers to determine
          which media flows that should be synchronized with each other
          between different RTP sessions carrying different media types. Thus
          it is important to quickly receive this for each media sender in the
          session when joining an RTP session.</t>

          <t>Sender Reports (SR) is used in combination with the above SDES
          CNAME mechanism to synchronize multiple RTP streams, such as audio
          and video. After having determined which media streams should be
          synchronized using the CNAME field, the receiver uses the Sender
          Report's NTP and RTP timestamp fields to establish
          synchronization.</t>
        </list>Reviewing the above it is obvious that both SR/RR and the CNAME
      are very important for new session participants to be able to utilize
      any received media and to avoid flooding the network with RTCP reports.
      In addition, if not sent regularly the dynamic nature of the information
      provided would make it less and less useful.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-benefitts" title="Benefits with reduced size RTCP">
      <t>As mentioned in the introduction, most advantages of using reduced
      size RTCP packets exists in cases when the available RTCP bitrate is
      limited. This because they can become substantially smaller than
      compound packets. A compound packet is forced to contain both an RR or
      an SR and the CNAME SDES item. The RR containing a report block for a
      single source is 32 bytes, an SR is 52 bytes. Both may be larger if they
      contain report blocks for multiple sources. The SDES packet containing a
      CNAME item will be 10 bytes plus the CNAME string length. Here it is
      reasonable that the CNAME string is at least 10 bytes to get a decent
      collision resistance. If the recommended form of user@host is used, then
      most strings will be longer than 20 characters. Thus a reduced size RTCP
      can become at least 70-80 bytes smaller than the compound packet.</t>

      <t>The following benefits exist for reduced size RTCP,</t>

      <section anchor="sec-low-bitrate-links" title="Low birate links">
        <t>For low bitrate links the benefits are as follows.<list
            style="symbols">
            <t>For links where the packet loss rate grows with the packet
            size, smaller packets are be less likely to be dropped. An example
            of such links are radio links. In the cellular world there exist
            links that are optimized to handle RTP packets sized for carrying
            compressed speech. This increases the capacity and coverage for
            voice services in a given wireless network. Minimal compound RTCP
            packets are commonly 2-3 times the size of a RTP packet carrying
            compressed speech. If the speech packet over such a bearer has a
            packet loss probability of p, then the RTCP packet will experience
            a loss probability of 1-(1-p)^x where x is the number of fragments
            the compound packet will be split on the link layer, i.e. commonly
            into 2 or 3 fragments.</t>

            <t>Shorter serialization time, i.e the time it takes the link to
            transmit the packet. For slower links this time can be
            substantial. For example transmitting 120 bytes over an link
            interface capable of 30 kbps takes 32 milliseconds (ms) assuming
            uniform transmission rate.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In cases when reduced size RTCP carry important and time sensitive
        feedback, both shorter serialization time and the lower loss
        probability are important to enable the best possible functionality.
        Having a packet loss rate that is much higher for the feedback packets
        compared to media packets hurts when trying to perform media
        adaptation, to for example handle the changed performance present at
        the cell border in a cellular system.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Higher bitrates">
        <t>For high bitrate applications there is usually no problem to supply
        RTCP with sufficient bitrates. When using AVPF one can use the
        "trr-int" parameter to restrict the regular reporting interval to
        approximately once per RTT or less often. As in most cases there is
        little reason to provide with regular reports of higher density than
        this. Any additional bandwidth can then be used for feedback messages.
        The benefit of reduced size RTCP in this case is limited, but exists.
        One typical example is video using generic NACK in cases where the RTT
        is low. Using reduced size RTCP would reduce the total amount of bits
        used for RTCP. This is primarily applicable if the number of reports
        is large. This would also result in lower processing delay and less
        complexity for the feedback packets as they do not need to query the
        RTCP database to construct the right messages.</t>

        <t>As message size is generally a smaller issue at higher bitrates, it
        is also possible to transmit multiple RTCP in each lower layer
        datagram in these cases. The motivation behind reduced size RTCP in
        this case is not size, rather it is to avoid the extra overhead caused
        by inclusion of the SR/RR and SDES CNAME items in each transmitted
        RTCP.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-benefits-high-low"
               title="Both high and low bitrate links">
        <t>Independently of the link type there are additional benefits with
        sending feedback in small reduced size RTCP. <list style="symbols">
            <t>Applications that use RTCP AVPF in early or immediate mode to
            send frequent event driven feedback. Under these circumstances,
            the risk that the RTCP bandwidth becomes too high during periods
            of heavy adaptation feedback signaling is reduced.</t>

            <t>In cases when regular feedback is needed, such as the profile
            under development for TCP friendly rate control (TFRC) for RTP
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-avt-tfrc-profile"></xref>, the size of
            compound RTCP can result in very high bandwidth requirements if
            the round trip time is short. For this particular application
            reduced size RTCP gives a very substantial improvement.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-use-cases" title="Use cases for reduced size RTCP">
      <t>Below are listed a few use cases for reduced size RTCP. The current
      use of reduced size RTCP is very application specific. A general
      definition of the use of it for e.g control plane or codec control
      signaling would probably need to be specified in the IETF.</t>

      <section title="Control plane signaling">
        <t>Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Push-to-talk over Cellular (PoC) <xref
        target="OMA-PoC"> </xref> makes use of reduced size RTCP when
        transmitting certain events. The OMA POC service is primarily used
        over cellular links capable of IP transport, such as the GSM GPRS.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Codec control signaling">
        <t>Examples of codec control usage for reduced size RTCP are found in
        <xref target="3GPP-MTSI"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Another example that can be used with reduced size RTCP is e.g
        TMMBR messages as specified in <xref target="RFC5104"></xref> which
        signal a request for a change in codec bitrate. The benefit of its use
        for these messages is that in bad channel conditions as they are much
        more likely to be successfully received than larger compound RTCP.
        This is critical as these messages are likely to occur when channel
        conditions are poor.</t>

        <t></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Feedback">
        <t>An example of a feedback scenario that would benefit from reduced
        size RTCP is Video streams with generic NACK. In cases where the RTT
        is shorter than the receiver buffer depth, generic NACK can be used to
        request retransmission of missing packets, thus improving playout
        quality considerably. If the generic NACK packets are transmitted as
        reduced size RTCP, the bandwidth requirement for RTCP will be minimal,
        enabling more frequent feedback. Like in the Codec control case it is
        important that these packets can be transmitted with as little delay
        as possible.</t>

        <t>Another interesting use for reduced size RTCP is in cases when
        regular feedback is needed, as described in <xref
        target="sec-benefits-high-low"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-status-reports" title="Status reports">
        <t>One proposed idea is to transmit small measurement or status
        reports in reduced size RTCP, and to be able to split the minimal
        compound RTCP and transmit the individual RTCP separately. The status
        reports can be used either by the endpoints or by other network
        monitoring boxes in the network.</t>

        <t>The benefit is that with some radio access technologies small
        packets are more robust to poor radio conditions than large packets.
        Additionally, with small (report) packets there is a smaller risk that
        the report packets will affect the channel that they report upon.</t>

        <t>Another benefit is that it is, with reduced size RTCP, possible to
        allow e.g anonymous status reporting to be transmitted unencrypted.
        Something that may be beneficial for e.g network monitoring
        purposes.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-issues" title="Issues with reduced size RTCP">
      <t>This section describes the known issues with reduced size RTCP and
      also a brief analysis.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-middleboxes" title="Middle boxes">
        <t>Middle boxes in the network may discard RTCP that do not follow the
        rules outlined in section 6.1 of RFC3550. Newer report types may be
        interpreted as unknown by the middle box. For instance if the payload
        type number is 207 instead of 200 or 201 it may be treated as unknown.
        The effect of this might for instance be that compound RTCP would get
        through while the reduced size RTCP would be lost.</t>

        <t>Verification of the delivery of reduced size RTCP is discussed in
        <xref target="sec-verification"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-packet-validation" title="Packet Validation">
        <t>A reduced size RTCP will be discarded by the packet validation code
        in Appendix A of <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>. This has several
        impacts as described in the following sub sections.</t>

        <section title="Old RTCP Receivers">
          <t>Any RTCP receiver without updated packet validation code will
          discard the reduced size RTCP which means that the receiver will not
          see e.g the contained feedback messages. The effect of this depends
          on the type of feedback message and the role of the receiver. For
          example this may cause complete function loss in the case of
          attempting to use a reduced size NACK message (see Section 6.2.1 of
          <xref target="RFC4585"></xref>) to non updated media sender in a
          session using the retransmission scheme defined by <xref
          target="RFC4588"></xref>.</t>

          <t>This type of discarding would also effect the feedback
          suppression defined in AVPF. The result would be a partitioning of
          the receivers within the session between old ones only seeing the
          compound RTCP feedback messages and the newer ones seeing both.
          Where the old ones may send feedback messages for events already
          reported on in reduced size RTCP.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Weakened Packet Validation">
          <t>The packet validation code needs to be rewritten to accept
          reduced size RTCP. This in particular affects section 9.1 in <xref
          target="RFC3550"></xref> in the sense that the header verification
          must take into account that the payload type numbers for the (first)
          RTCP in the lower layer datagram may differ from 200 or 201 (SR or
          RR).</t>

          <t>One potential effect of this change is much weaker validation
          that received packets actually are RTCP, and not packets of some
          other type being wrongly delivered. Thus some consideration should
          be done to ensure the best possible validation is available. For
          example restricting reduced size RTCP to contain only some specific
          RTCP packet types, that is preferably signalled on a session
          basis.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Bandwidth considerations">
          <t>The discarding of reduced size RTCP would effect the RTCP
          transmission calculation in the following way: the avg_rtcp_size
          value would become larger than for RTP receivers that exclude the
          reduced size RTCP in this calculation (assuming that reduced size
          RTCP are smaller than compound ones). Therefore these senders would
          under-utilize the available bitrate and send with a longer interval
          than updated receivers. For most sessions this should not be an
          issue. However for sessions with a large portion of reduced size
          RTCP may result in that the updated receivers time out non-updated
          senders prematurely. A solution to this is presented in <xref
          target="sec-algorithm"></xref>.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Computation of avg_rtcp_size">
          <t>Long intervals between compound RTCP and many reduced size RTCP
          in between may lead to a computation of a value for avg_rtcp_size
          that varies greatly over time. This is discussed more in <xref
          target="sec-algorithm"></xref>.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Encryption/authentication">
        <t>SRTP presents a problem for reduced size RTCP. Section 3.4 in <xref
        target="RFC3711"></xref> states "SRTCP MUST be given packets according
        to that requirement in the sense that the first part MUST be a sender
        report or a receiver report".</t>

        <t>However the same text also states that the encryption prefix that
        is present in the receiver and sender reports should not be used by
        SRTP. The conclusion is therefore that it is possible to use reduced
        size RTCP with SRTP.</t>

            <t>Payload type number identification: The RoHC header compression
            algorithm <xref target="RFC3095"></xref> needs to create different
            compression contexts for RTP and RTCP for optimum performance. If
            RTP and RTCP are multiplexed on the same port the classification
            may be based on payload type numbers. The classification algorithm
            must here acknowledge the fact that the payload type number for
            (the first) RTCP may differ from 200 or 201.</t>

            <t>Compression of RTCP: No IETF defined header compression method
            compress RTCP, however if such methods are developed in the
            future, these methods must take reduced size RTCP in account.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-rules"
             title="Rules and guidelines for non-compound packets in AVPF">
      <t>Based on the above analysis it seems feasible to allow transmission
      of reduced size RTCP under some restrictions.</t>

      <t>First of all it is important that compound RTCP are transmitted at
      regular intervals to ensure that the feedback reporting works. The
      tracking of session size and number of participants is also important as
      this ensures that the RTCP bandwidth remain bounded independent of the
      number of session participants.</t>

      <t>As the compound RTCP are also used to establish and maintain
      synchronization between media, any newly joining participant in a
      session would need to receive compound RTCP from the media
      sender(s).</t>

      <t>In summary the regular usage of compound RTCP must be maintained
      throughout the complete session. Thus reduced size RTCP should be
      restricted to be used as extra RTCP (e.g feedback) sent in cases when a
      regular compound RTCP would not have been sent.</t>

      <t>The usage of reduced size RTCP SHALL only be done in RTP sessions
      operating in <xref target="RFC4585">AVPF</xref> Early or Immediate mode.
      Reduced size RTCP SHALL NOT be sent until at least one compound RTCP has
      been sent. In Immediate mode all feedback messages MAY be sent as
      reduced size RTCP. In early mode a feedback message scheduled for
      transmission as an Early RTCP, i.e not a Regular RTCP, MAY be sent as
      reduced size RTCP. All RTCP that are scheduled for transmission as
      Regular RTCP SHALL be sent as (full) compound RTCP as indicated by <xref
      target="RFC4585">AVPF</xref>.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-definition" title="Definition of non-compound RTCP">
        <t>A reduced size RTCP deviates from the rules regarding (minimal)
        compound RTCP given in RFC3550/4585 in the aspect that they don't
        contain both the mandatory elements SR/RR and SDES-CNAME. The
        definition does not make any distinction based on size. This means
        that it is possible to transmit multiple RTCP in one lower layer
        datagram.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-algorithm" title="Algorithm considerations">
        <section anchor="sec-verification" title="Verification of delivery">
          <t>If an application is to use reduced size RTCP it is important to
          verify that they actually reach the session participants. As
          outlined above in <xref target="sec-middleboxes"></xref> and <xref
          target="sec-packet-validation"></xref> packets may be discarded
          along the path or in the end-point.</t>

          <t>The end-points can be resolved by introducing signaling that
          informs if all session participants are capable of reduced size
          RTCP.</t>

          <t>The middle box issue is more difficult and here one will be
          required to use heuristics to determine if the reduced size RTCP are
          delivered or not. However in many cases the feedback messages sent
          using reduced size RTCP will result in either explicit or implicit
          indications that they have been received. Example of such are the
          <xref target="RFC4588">RTP retransmission</xref> that result from a
          <xref target="RFC4585">NACK message</xref>, the <xref
          target="RFC5104">Temporary Maximum Media Bitrate Notification
          message resulting from a Temporary Maximum Media Bitrate
          Request</xref>, or the presence of a <xref target="RFC5104">Decoder
          Refresh Point</xref> in the video media stream resulting from the
          Full Intra Request sent.</t>

          <t>An algorithm to detect consistent failure of delivery of reduced
          size RTCP must be used by any application using it. The details of
          this algorithm is application dependent and therefore outside the
          scope of this document.</t>

          <t>A method to detect if reduced size RTCP are discarded is to send
          a single SR packet in a lower layer datagram, then check that the
          timestamp is echoed back in the corresponding RR packet. This
          verification method is not completely safe however as it SR is still
          one of the expected packet types.</t>

          <t>If the verification fails it is strongly RECOMMENDED that only
          compound RTCP according to the rules outlined in RFC3550 is
          transmitted.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Single vs multiple RTCP in a reduced size RTCP">
          <t>The result of the definition in <xref
          target="sec-definition"></xref> may be that the resulting size of
          reduced size RTCP can become larger than a normal compound RTCP. For
          applications that use access types that are sensitive to packet size
          (see <xref target="sec-low-bitrate-links"></xref>) it is strongly
          RECOMMENDED that the use of reduced size RTCP is limited to the
          transmission of single RTCP in each lower layer datagram.</t>

          <t>The methods to determine the need for this is outside the scope
          of this draft.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Enforcing compound RTCP">
          <t>As discussed earlier it is important that the transmission of
          compound RTCP occurs at regular intervals. However, this will occur
          as long as the RTCP senders follow the AVPF scheduling algorithm
          defined in Section 3.5 in <xref target="RFC4585"></xref>. This as
          all regular RTCP must be full compound RTCP. Note that also in
          immediate mode is there a requirement on sending regular RTCP.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Immediate mode">
          <t>Section 3.3 in RFC4585 gives the option to use AVPF Immediate
          mode as long as the groupsize is below a certain limit. As
          transmission using reduced size RTCP may become reduce the bandwidth
          demand it opens up for a more liberal use of immediate mode.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-sdp-attribute" title="SDP Signalling Attribute">
        <t>We request to define the "a=rtcp-rsize" <xref
        target="RFC4566"></xref> attribute to indicate if the session
        participant is capable of supporting reduced size RTCP. It is a
        required that a participant that proposes the use of reduced size RTCP
        itself supports the reception of reduced size RTCP.</t>

        <t>An offering client that wish to use reduced size RTCP MUST include
        the attribute "a=rtcp-rsize" in the SDP offer. If "a=rtcp-rsize" is
        present in the offer SDP, the answerer that supports reduced size RTCP
        and wish to use it SHALL include the "a=rtcp-rsize" attribute in the
        answer.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>Following the guidelines in <xref target="RFC4566"></xref>, the IANA
      is requested to register one new SDP attribute:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Contact name, email address and telephone number: Authors of

          <t>Subject to charset: no</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This attribute defines the support for reduced size RTCP, i.e the
      possibility to transmit RTCP that does not conform to the rules for
      compund RTCP defined in RFC3550. It is a property attribute, which does
      not take a value.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations of <xref target="RFC3550">RTP</xref> and
      <xref target="RFC4585">AVPF</xref> will apply also to reduced size RTCP.
      The reduction in validation strength for received packets on the RTCP
      port may result in a higher degree of acceptance of spurious data as
      real RTCP. This vulnerability can mostly be addressed by usage of any
      security mechanism that provide authentication, one example such
      mechanism is SRTP <xref target="RFC3711"></xref>.</t>
