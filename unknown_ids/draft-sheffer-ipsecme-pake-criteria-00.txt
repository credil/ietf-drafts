Abstract

   The IPsecME working group has been chartered with specifying a new
   password-based authentication method for IKEv2.  This document
   presents a few solution alternatives, and lists potential criteria
   for choosing among them.  It is not the author's intention to publish
   this document as an RFC.  Moreover, it is more subjective than most
   IETF documents.

Internet-Draft    Password Based Authentiction in IKEv2       March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The new IPsecME WG charter defines a new work item on password-based
   authentication for IKEv2.  This is a somewhat contentious issue, so
   the charter is very particular about the requirements.  Quoting in
   full:

      IKEv2 supports mutual authentication with a shared secret, but
      this mechanism is intended for "strong" shared secrets.  User-
      chosen passwords are typically of low entropy and subject to off-
      line dictionary attacks when used with this mechanism.  Thus, RFC
      4306 recommends using EAP with public-key based authentication of
      the responder instead.  This approach would be typically used in
      enterprise remote access VPN scenarios where the VPN gateway does
      not usually even have the actual passwords for all users, but
      instead typically communicates with a back-end RADIUS server.
      However, user-configured shared secrets are still useful for many
      other IPsec scenarios, such as authentication between two servers
      or routers.  These scenarios are usually symmetric: both peers
      know the shared secret, no back-end authentication servers are
      involved, and either peer can initiate an IKEv2 SA.  While it
      would be possible to use EAP in such situations (by having both
      peers implement both the EAP peer and the EAP server roles of an
      EAP method intended for "weak" shared secrets) with the mutual
      EAP-based authentication work item (above), a simpler solution may
      be desirable in many situations.
      The WG will develop a standards-track extension to IKEv2 to allow
      mutual authentication based on "weak" (low-entropy) shared
      secrets.  The goal is to avoid off-line dictionary attacks without
      requiring the use of certificates or EAP.  There are many already-
      developed algorithms that can be used, and the WG would need to
      pick one that both is believed to be secure and is believed to
      have acceptable intellectual property features.  The WG would also
      need to develop the protocol to use the chosen algorithm in IKEv2
      in a secure fashion.  It is noted up front that this work item
      poses a higher chance of failing to be completed than other WG
      work items; this is balanced by the very high expected value of
      the extension if it is standardized and deployed.

   The charter defines some properties that a good solution is required
   to have.  For example, despite the fact that EAP is an integral part
   of IKEv2, there are good reasons to avoid it in this case.  But the
   charter does not name a specific cryptographic protocol on which to
   base this solution, nor does it mention a specific IETF document as a
   starting point.  This document asserts that several such choices are
   possible, and attempts to provide the group with some selection
   criteria, in order to enable a reasoned discussion of these (and
   possibly other) alternatives.

2.  Terminology

   This document is entirely non-normative.  None of the IETF-
   capitalized words SHOULD be used, and if perchance they are, they
   MUST be ignored.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Selection Criteria

   IKEv2 is targeted at applications that require a very high level of
   security.  Therefore, adding a new mode of operation to the protocol
   can only be done after careful consideration.  In this section, I
   describe some of the criteria we can use to choose between solution
   candidates.  Unfortunately, I am not aware of any potential solution
   that score a "perfect 10" under these criteria.  If this paper
   encourages the development of new solutions that better fit the
   criteria, so much the better.

3.1.  Security Criteria

   The primary requirement from a good solution is to have a high level
   of security.  Unfortunately, we all know this property is extremely
   hard to gauge.  But some data might enhance our confidence in a
   solution's security.

   o  The protocol has good security "best practices", such as crypto
      agility.
   o  The solution is based on a cryptographic protocol that has been
      (openly) published some time ago, giving the cryptographic
      community enough time to have reviewed it.  Preferably, it was
      published in a location where it is more likely to be reviewed,
      e.g. a peer-reviewed crypto journal.
   o  The protocol has undergone thorough professional analysis.  It's
      best if protocol analyses by prominent cryptographers have been
      published.  If issued were uncovered, we would prefer repeat
      analysis to have been undertaken on the fixed protocol.
   o  Some modern protocols have been mathematically proven secure under
      various models.  This is an attractive feature of such protocols.

3.2.  Intellectual Property

   "Intellectual property", a common euphemism for patents, is a complex
   issue.  The existence of patents covering a specific technology is
   often an important consideration for vendors, and critical for open

   source implementers.  Despite this fact, the IETF does not provide
   its constituency with any legal guidance or assistance in this
   matter.

   Unfortunately, the specific area of password-based authentication is
   riddled with patents.  This has hampered the IETF adoption of this
   technology for years, and caused at least one working group to fail.
   As a result, we (as individual implementers and as a working group)
   need to understand as best we can the IPR status of each proposal.

      Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, and this document should not be
      construed as legal advice.

   IETF rules require that any participant who's aware of a patent
   relevant to an IETF work item should disclose the patent's existence.
   In practice, such disclosures are often submitted very late in the
   process, resulting in a long period when a document's IPR status
   remains unclear.  Even more worryingly, in at least one case I am
   aware of, a company filed an IPR statement for a competitive
   technology asserting their own patent, even though the technology is
   in fact covered by another patent, making it very likely that the
   company's patent does not apply to the technology.  Given this
   background, I propose the following as selection criteria:

   o  Ideally, the proposal should be unencumbered.  This property is
      very difficult to prove, and each WG participant should attempt to
      review the applicable patents and determine whether in fact they
      do not apply to the proposal.  Remember that independently
      invented technology might still infringe a patent.
   o  In some cases the IPR situation is clear: if the protocol relies
      on a specific patent, and believed to not require the use of any
      other.  This is mostly useful if the patent's licensing terms
      (whether free or not) are known, and/or the patent's expiration
      date is near.
   o  Many IETF participants, and the IETF as an organization, quite
      naturally prefer freely licensed technology to non-free licensing
      terms.

3.3.  Other Considerations

   A few additional criteria may be just as important:

   o  Protocols that have been specified within standards document
      should be preferred over protocols that are only described in
      scientific papers.  Such description is typically insufficient to
      provide interoperability, and may not be sufficient for a serious
      security analysis.

   o  Likewise, cryptographic protocols that have been integrated into
      the IKE framework have an advantage over those described only
      within other security protocols.
   o  Finally, there are many engineering criteria that apply to any
      protocol, including number of round trips, ease of implementation
      etc.


4.  Some Possible Candidates

   This section provides background regarding some of the candidate
   protocols.  Some pertinent properties are mentioned, but this is by
   no means an analysis against the criteria defined above.

   1.  EKE is the oldest password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE)
       protocol still considered secure, although some of its variants
       have been broken.  It is covered by a patent, due to expire in
       late 2011.
   2.  SPSK (a.k.a.  EAP-PWD) is a relatively new mechanism.  It has
       been standardized within IEEE 802.11s.
   3.  PAK is the earliest provably-secure mechanism.  A protocol
       description has been standardized within the IETF, but no other
       IETF PAK-based protocol exists.  PAK is patented (IPR statement
       #1179).
   4.  SRP has been deployed in multiple products.  It is described by
       several IETF documents, including a TLS-SRP variant.  SRP can be
       used under a royalty-free license.

   In addition, applicable standards to be consulted for these and
   additional protocols include:

   o  IEEE P1363.2, Specifications for Password based Public Key
      Cryptographic Techniques.
   o  ISO/IEC 11770-4:2006 Information technology - Security techniques
      - Key management - Part 4: Mechanisms based on weak secrets.


5.  Comparison Table

   This is a very rough attempt at a comparative analysis.  Many of the
   details are incomplete, and/or controversial.
