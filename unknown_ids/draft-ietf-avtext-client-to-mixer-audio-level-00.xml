        <abstract>
        <t>This document defines a mechanism by which packets of
        Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) audio streams can indicate,
        in an RTP header extension, the audio level of the audio
        sample carried in the RTP packet.  In large conferences, this
        can reduce the load on an audio mixer or other middlebox which
        wants to forward only a few of the loudest audio streams,
        without requiring it to decode and measure every stream that
        is received.</t>
        </abstract>

    </front>

<section title='Introduction' anchor='introduction'>

<t>In a centralized <xref target='RFC3550'>Real-Time Transport Protocol
(RTP)</xref> audio conference, an audio mixer or
  forwarder receives audio streams from many or all of the conference
  participants.  It then selectively forwards some of them to
  other participants in the conference.  In
  large conferences, it is possible that such a server might be
  receiving a large number of streams, of which only a few should be
  forwarded to the other conference participants.</t>

<t>In such a scenario, in order to pick the audio streams to forward,
  a centralized server needs to decode, measure audio levels, and
  possibly perform voice activity detection on audio data from a large
  number of streams.  The need for such processing limits the size or
  number of conferences such a server can support.</t>

<t>As an alternative, this document defines
  an <xref target='RFC5285'>RTP header extension</xref> through which
  senders of audio packets can indicate the audio level of the
  packets' payload, reducing the processing load for a server.
</t>

<t>The header extension in this draft is different to, but
  complementary with, the one defined in
  <xref target='I-D.ivov-avt-slic' />, which defines a mechanism by
  which audio mixers can indicate to clients the levels of the
  contributing sources that made up the mixed audio.</t>

</section>

<section title='Terminology'>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" in this document
are to be interpreted as described in <xref
target='RFC2119'>RFC 2119</xref> and indicate requirement levels for
compliant implementations.</t>

</section>

<section title='Audio Levels'>

<t>The audio level header extension carries both the level of the
  audio carried in the RTP payload of the packet it is associated
  with, as well as an indication as to whether voice activity
  has been detected in the packet.</t>

<t>The form of the audio level extension block is as follows:</t>

<figure anchor='exthdr'>
<artwork>
<![CDATA[
       0                   1
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  ID   | len=0 |V| level       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
]]>
</artwork>
</figure>

<t>The length field takes the value 0 to indicate that 1 byte follows.</t>

<t>The audio level is defined in the same manner as is audio noise
  level in the <xref target='RFC3389'>RTP Comfort Noise</xref>
  specification.  In that specification, the overall magnitude of
  the noise level is encoded into the first byte of the payload, with
  spectral information about the noise in subsequent bytes.  This
  specification's audio level parameter is defined so as to be
  identical to the comfort noise payload's noise-level byte.</t>

<t>The magnitude of the audio level is packed into the seven least
  significant bits of the single byte of the header extension,
  shown in <xref target='exthdr'/>.
  The least significant bit of the audio level
  magnitude is packed into the least significant bit of the byte.
  The most significant bit of the byte is used as a separate flag bit
  "V", defined below.</t>

 <t>The audio level is expressed in -dBov, with values from 0 to 127
   representing 0 to -127 dBov.  dBov is the level, in decibels,
   relative to the overload point of the system, i.e. the maximum-amplitude
   signal that can be handled by the system without clipping.
   (Note: Representation relative to the
   overload point of a system is particularly useful for digital
   implementations, since one does not need to know the relative
   calibration of the analog circuitry.)  For example, in the case of
   <xref target='ITU.G711.1988'>u-law (audio/pcmu) audio</xref>, the 0
   dBov reference would be a square wave with values
   +/- 8031.  (This translates to 6.18 dBm0, relative to u-law's dBm0
   definition in Table 6 of G.711.)</t>

<t>In addition, a flag bit (labeled V) indicates whether
  the encoder believes the audio packet contains voice activity (1) or
  does not (0).  The voice activity detection algorithm is
  unspecified and left implementation-specific.</t>

<t>The audio level for digital silence (e.g. all-0 pcmu audio),
  for example for a muted audio source, MAY be represented as 127 (-127
  dBov), regardless of the dynamic range of the encoded audio format.</t>

<t>When this header extension is used with RTP data sent
    using <xref target='RFC2198'>the RTP Payload for Redundant Audio
    Data</xref>, the header's data describes the contents of the
    primary encoding.</t>

</section>

<section title='Signaling (Setup) Information'>

<t>The URI for declaring this header extension in an extmap attribute is
   "urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:audio-level".  There is no additional setup
   information needed for this extension (no extensionattributes).</t>

</section>

<section title='Considerations on Use' anchor='use'>

<t>Mixers and forwarders generally should not base audio forwarding
  decisions directly on packet-by-packet audio level information, but
  rather should apply some analysis of the audio levels and trends.
  This general rule applies whether audio levels are provided by
  endpoints (as defined in this document), or are calculated at a
  server, as would be done in the absence of this information.  This
  section discusses several issues that mixers and forwarders may
  wish to take into account.  (Note that this section provides design
  guidance only, and is not normative.)</t>

<t>First of all, audio levels should generally be measured over longer
  intervals than that of a single audio packet.  In order to avoid
  false-positives for short bursts of sound (such as a cough or a
  dropped microphone), it is often useful to require that a
  participant's audio level be maintained for some period of time
  before considering it to be "real", i.e. some type of low-pass
  filter should be applied to the audio levels.  Note, though, that such
  filtering must be balanced with the need to avoid clipping of
  the beginning of a speaker's speech.</t>

<t>Additionally, different participants may have their audio input set
  differently.  It may be useful to apply some sort of automatic gain
  control to the audio levels.  There are a number of possible
  approaches to acheiving this, e.g. by measuring peak audio levels,
  by average audio levels during speech, or by measuring background
  audio levels (average audio level levels during non-speech).</t>

</section>

<section title='Limitations' anchor='limitations'>

<t>The audio levels carried by the extension header defined by this
  document are defined as dBov, decibels below system overload.</t>

<t>In principle, it could be more useful to have, instead, dB SPL,
  decibels of sound pressure level.  In traditional telephony systems,
  telephone handsets were calibrated such that a particular (e.g.)
  u-law audio level, or analog voltage, corresponded to a particular
  sound pressure level at the handset's mouthpiece.</t>

<t>However, in many environments, this information is not available.
  Notably, PC soundcard hardware can only determine the levels of mic-
  or line-in at the hardware input, and operating systems usually
  allow further adjustments of audio input levels without providing
  information about these transformations to applications.
  Furthermore, in many circumstances, such as speech synthesis or
  mixed audio, an "audio" signal may in fact never have actually
  existed as sound pressure at all.</t>

<t>Thus, while information about the correspondance between dB SPL and
  dBov, or encoded audio, could be useful, this document does not
  attempt to define it.  If there are circumstances in which this
  information would be useful, a separate header extension would be
  straightforward to define.  (The information carried by such a
  header extension could indeed be useful independently from the
  information in the header extension defined by this document.)</t>

</section>

<section title='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>

<t>A malicious endpoint could choose to set the values in this
  header extension falsely, so as to falsely claim that audio or voice
  is or is not present.  It is not clear what could be gained by
  falsely claiming that audio is not present, but an endpoint falsely
  claiming that audio is present could perform a denial-of-service
  attack on an audio conference, so as to send silence to suppress
  other conference members' audio.  Thus, a device relying on audio
  level data from untrusted endpoints SHOULD periodically audit the
  level information transmitted, taking appropriate corrective action
  if endpoints appear to be sending incorrect data.  (Note that
  endpoints MAY choose to measure audio levels prior to encoding, so
  some degree of discrepancy SHOULD be tolerated.)</t>

<t>In the <xref target='RFC3711'>Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol
    (SRTP)</xref>, RTP header extensions are authenticated but not
    encrypted.  When this header extension is used, audio levels are
    therefore visible on a packet-by-packet basis to an attacker
    passively observing the audio stream.  As discussed in
    <xref target='I-D.perkins-avt-srtp-vbr-audio' />, such an attacker
    might be able to infer information about the conversation,
    possibly with phoneme-level resolution.  In scenarios where this is a
    concern, additional mechanisms SHOULD be used to protect the
    confidentiality of the header extension.  One solution would be
    <xref target='I-D.lennox-avt-srtp-encrypted-extension-headers'>header
    extension encryption</xref>.</t>

<t>In order to more accurately determine signal-to-noise ratio, it
  would be useful for a sender to also send its estimate of its
  current audio noise floor.  If so, it's unclear whether this would
  be better as a separate header extension element, or added to this
  header extension element.</t>

<t>It has been suggested to reference <xref target='ITU.P56.1993'>ITU
