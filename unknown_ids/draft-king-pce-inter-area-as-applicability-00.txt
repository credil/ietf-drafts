1. Introduction

   Computing paths across large multi-domain environments may 
   require special computational components and cooperation between
   entities in different domains capable of complex path computation.
   The Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655] provides an architecture
   and functional components to address this problem space.

   Computing optimal routes for LSPs that cross domains in MPLS-TE and
   GMPLS networks presents a problem because no single point of path 
   computation is aware of all of the links and resources in each 
   domain. A solution may be achieved using the PCE architecture 
   [RFC4655].    

   A domain can be defined as a separate administrative, geographic, or
   switching environment within the network. A domain may be further
   defined as a zone of routing or computational ability. Under these
   definitions a domain might be categorized as an Antonymous System
   (AS) or an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area [RFC4726] and
   [RFC4655].

   A PCE may be used to compute end-to-end paths across multi-domain 
   environments using a per-domain path computation technique [RFC5152]. 
   The backward recursive path computation (BRPC) mechanism [RFC5441].
   Both per-domain and BRPC techniques assume that the sequence of
   domains to be crossed from source to destination is well known. 
   In more advanced deployments (including multi-area and multi-AS
   environments) the sequence of domains may not be known in advance
   and the choice of domains in the end-to-end domain sequence might be
   critical to the determination of an optimal end-to-end path. In
   this case the use of the Hierarchical PCE [H-PCE] architecture and
   mechanisms may be used to discovery and select the optimal 
   end-to-end domain sequence. 

   This document examines the applicability and describes the processes
   and procedures available when using the PCE architecture, protocols
   and protocol extensions for computing inter-area and inter-AS MPLS
   Traffic Engineered paths.

1.1 Domains

   For the purposes of this document, a domain is considered to be a
   collection of network elements within an area or AS that has a common
   sphere of address management or path computational responsibility. 
   Wholly or partially overlapping domains are not within the scope of
   this document.

   In the context of GMPLS, a particularly important example of a domain
   is the Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) subnetwork
   [G-8080]. In this case, computation of an end-to-end path requires
   the selection of nodes and links within a parent domain where some
   nodes may, in fact, be subnetworks. Furthermore, a domain might be an
   ASON routing area [G-7715]. A PCE may perform the path computation
   function of an ASON routing controller as described in [G-7715-2].

   It is assumed that a PCE architecture should be applied to small 
   inter-domain topologies and not solving route computation issues
   across large groups of domains, I.E. the entire Internet. 

1.2 Path Computation

   For the purpose of this document it is assumed that the 
   path computation is the sole responsibility of the PCE as per the
   architecture defined in [RFC4655]. When a path is required the Path
   Computation Client (PCC) will send a request to the PCE. The PCE will
   apply the required constraints and compute a path and return a 
   response to the PCC. In the context of this document it maybe
   necessary for the PCE to co-operate with other PCEs in adjacent
   domains (as per BRPC [RFC5441]) or cooperate with the Parent PCE 
   (as per [H-PCE]).

   It is entirely feasible that an operator could compute a path across
   multiple domains without the use of a PCE if the relevant domain 
   information is available to the network planner or network management
   platform. The definition of what relevant information is required to
   perform this network planning operation and how that information is
   discovered and applied is outside the scope of this document.

1.3 Traffic Engineering Aggregation and Abstraction

   Networks are often constructed from multiple areas or ASs that are
   interconnected via multiple interconnect points. To maintain 
   network confidentiality and scalability TE properties of each area
   and AS are not generally advertized outside each specific area or AS. 

   TE aggregation or abstraction provide mechanism to hide information
   but may cause failed path setups or the selection of suboptimal 
   end-to-end paths [RFC4726]. The aggregation process may also have
   significant scaling issues for networks with many possible routes
   and multiple TE metrics. Flooding TE information breaks
   confidentiality and does not scale in the routing protocol.

   The PCE architecture and associated mechanisms provide a solution
   to avoid the use of TE aggregation and abstraction. 
   
1.4 Traffic Engineered Label Switched Paths

   This document highlights the PCE techniques and mechanisms that exist
   for establishing TE packet and optical LSPs across multiple areas 
   (inter-area TE LSP) and ASs (inter-AS TE LSP). In this context and
   within the remainder of this document, we consider all LSPs to be
   constraint-based and traffic engineered. 

   Three signaling options are defined for setting up an inter-area or 
   inter-AS LSP [RFC4726]:

      - Contiguous LSP
      - Stitched LSP 
      - Nested LSP 

   All three signaling methods are applicable to the architectures and
   procedures discussed in this document.  
   
1.5 Inter-area and Inter AS Connectivity Discovery

   When using a PCE-based approach for inter-area and inter-AS path
   computation, a PCC in one area or AS may need to learn information
   related to inter-AS capable PCEs located in other ASs. The PCE
   discovery mechanism defined in [RFC5088] and [RFC5089] allow
   the discovery of PCEs and disclosure of information related to
   inter-area and inter-AS capable PCEs across area and AS boundaries.

2. Terminology

   Terminology used in this document.

   ABR: IGP Area Border Router, a router that is attached to more than
   one IGP area.

   Inter-area TE LSP: A TE LSP whose path transits through two or more
   IGP areas.

   Inter-AS MPLS TE LSP: A TE LSP whose path transits through two or
   more ASs or sub-ASs (BGP confederations

   LSP: Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path.

   LSR: Label Switching Router.
   
   TED: Traffic Engineering Database, which contains the topology and
   resource information of the domain.  The TED may be fed by Interior
   Gateway Protocol (IGP) extensions or potentially by other means.

   This document also uses the terminology defined in [RFC4655] and 
   [RFC5440].


3. Issues and Considerations

   TBD.
   
3.1 Multi-homed domains

3.2 Domain meshes

3.4 Destination location


4. Applicability of the PCE to Inter-area Traffic Engineering

   As networks increase in size and complexity it may be required to 
   introduce scaling methods to reduce the amount information flooded
   within the network and make the network more manageable. An IGP 
   hierarchy is designed to improve IGP scalability by dividing the
   IGP domain into areas and limiting the flooding scope of topology
   information to within area boundaries. This restricts visibility of
   the area to routers in a single area. If a router needs to compute a
   route to destination located in another area a method is required to
   compute a path across area boundaries.

   Per-domain path computation [RFC5152] exists to provide a method of 
   inter-area path computation. The per-domain solution is based on 
   loose hop routing with an Explicit Route Object (ERO) expansion on
   each Area Border Router (ABR).  This allows an LSP to be established
   using a constrained path, however at least two issues exist:

   - This method does not guarantee an optimal constrained path

   - The method may require several crankback signaling messages 
     increasing signaling traffic and delaying the LSP setup

   The PCE-based architecture [RFC4655] is designed to solve inter-area
   path computation problems. The issue of limited topology visibility 
   is resolved by introducing path computation entities that are able to
   cooperate in order to establish LSPs with source and destinations 
   located in different areas.

5. Applicability of the PCE to Inter-AS Traffic Engineering

   As discussed in section 4 (Applicability of the PCE to Inter-area
   Traffic Engineering) it is necessary to divide the network into
   smaller administrative domains, or ASes. If an LSR within an AS needs
   to compute a path across an AS boundary it must also use an inter-AS
   computation technique. RFC5152] defines mechanisms for the 
   computation of inter-domain TE LSPs using network elements along the
   signaling paths to compute per-domain constrained path segments.

   The PCE was designed to be capable of computing MPLS and GMPLS paths
   across AS boundaries. This section outlines the features of a 
   PCE-enabled solution for computing inter-AS paths.

5.1.3. AS Inclusion and Exclusion

5.2 Inter-AS Bandwidth Guarantees

   Many operators with multi-AS domains will have deployed MPLS-TE 
   Diffserv either across their entire network or at the domain 
   edges on CE-PE links. In situations where strict QOS bounds are
   required, admission control inside the network may also be required.
   
   When the propagation delay can be bounded, the performance targets,
   such as maximum one-way transit delay may be guaranteed by providing
   bandwidth guarantees along the Diffserv-enabled path.

   One typical example of this requirement is to provide bandwidth
   guarantees over an end-to-end path for VoIP traffic classified as EF
   (Expedited Forwarding) class in a Diffserv-enabled
   network. In the case where the EF path is extended across multiple
   ASes, inter-AS bandwidth guarantee would be required.

   Another case for inter-AS bandwidth guarantee is the requirement for
   guaranteeing a certain amount of transit bandwidth across one or
   multiple ASes.

5.3 Inter-AS Recovery

5.4 Inter-AS PCE Peering Policies


6. Mult-domain PCE Deployment Options

   The PCE provides the architecture and mechanisms to compute 
   inter-area and inter-AS LSPs. The objective of this document is not
   to reprint the techniques and mechanisms available, but to highlight
   their existence and reference the relevant documents that introduce
   and describe the techniques and mechanisms necessary for computing 
   inter-area and inter-AS LSP based services. 
 
   An area or AS may contain multiple PCEs:
   
   - The path computation load may be balanced among a set of PCEs to
     improve scalability. 
     
   - For the purpose of redundancy, primary and backup PCEs may be used.
   
   - PCEs may have distinct path computation capabilities (P2P or P2MP).
   
   Discovery of PCEs and capabilities per area or AS is defined in in
   [RFC5088] and [RFC5089].

   Each PCE per domain can be deployed in a centralized or distributed
   architecture, the latter model having local visibility and 
   collaborating in a distributed fashion to compute a path across the
   domain. Each PCE may collect topology and TE information from the
   same sources as the LSR, such as the IGP TED.

   When the PCC sends a path computation request to the PCE, the PCE 
   will compute the path across a domain based on the required 
   constraints. The PCE will generate the full set of strict hops from 
   source to destination. This information, encoded as an ERO, is then
   sent back to the PCC that requested the path. In the event that a 
   path request from a PCC contains source and destination nodes that 
   are located in different domains the PCE is required to co-operate 
   between multiple PCEs, each responsible for its own domain.  
   
   Techniques for inter-domain path computation are described in  
   [RFC5152] and [RFC5441], both techniques assume that the sequence of    
   domains to be crossed from source to destination is well known. In 
   the event that the sequence of domains is not well known, [H-PCE] 
   might be used.

6.1 Overview of Techniques

6.2 Traffic Engineering Database

6.3 Provisioning Techniques

6.4 Pre-Planning and Management-Based Solutions
 
   Offline path computation is performed ahead of time, before the LSP
   setup is requested.  That means that it is requested by, or performed
   as part of, a management application.  This model can be seen in
   Section 5.5 of [RFC4655].

   The offline model is particularly appropriate to long-lived LSPs
   (such as those present in a transport network) or for planned
   responses to network failures.  In these scenarios, more planning is
   normally a feature of LSP provisioning.

   This model may also be used where the network operator wishes to
   retain full manual control of the placement of LSPs, using the PCE
   only as a computation tool to assist the operator, not as part of an
   automated network.
