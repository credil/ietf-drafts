<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Summoning emergency help by the public is a core feature of telephone networks.
      This document describes a framework of how various IETF protocols are
      combined to place emergency calls. This includes how these calls are
      routed to the correct Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) based on the
      physical location of the caller, while providing the call taker the
      necessary information to dispatch a first responder to that location.
      This document explains how location mapping, call identification and end
      system behavior are combined to allow multimedia emergency calls. It
      describes at a high level how the pieces (recognizing a call as an
      emergency call, marking it as such, determining the location of the
      caller, routing the call based on location) go together, and references
      the Internet standards that define the details of these mechanisms.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p>Summoning police, the fire department or an ambulance in emergencies
      is one of the fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone. As
      telephone functionality moves from circuit-switched telephony to
      Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that this core
      functionality will continue to work at least as well as is has for the older technology. New
      devices and services are being made available which could be used to
      make a request for help which are not traditional telephones, and users
      are increasingly expecting them to be used to place emergency calls.
      However, many of the technical advantages of Internet multimedia require
      re-thinking of the traditional emergency calling architecture. This
      challenge also offers an opportunity to improve the operation of
      emergency calling technology, while potentially lowering its cost and
      complexity.
</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this document to enumerate and discuss all
      the differences between traditional (PSTN) and Internet telephony, but
      the core differences can be summarized as:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the separation/interleaving of signaling and media data
          packets;
</li>
<li>the emergence of application-independent carriers;
</li>
<li>the plethora of different media that can be accommodated;
</li>
<li>potential mobility of all end systems, including endpoints
          nominally thought of as fixed systems and not just those using radio
          access technology. For example, a wired phone connected to a router
          using a mobile data network such as EV-DO as an uplink;
</li>
</ul>

<p>This document focuses on how devices using the Internet can place
      emergency calls and how PSAPs can natively handle Internet multimedia
      emergency calls, rather than describing how circuit-switched PSAPs can
      handle VoIP calls. In many cases, PSAPs making the transition from
      circuit-switched interfaces to packet-switched interfaces may be able to
      use some of the mechanisms described here, in combination with gateways
      that translate packet-switched calls into legacy interfaces, e.g., to
      continue to be able to use existing call taker equipment.
</p>
<p>We distinguish an individual request for help, usually accomplished
      by dialing a short digit sequence like 9-1-1 or 1-1-2 from a call placed
      by specially designated persons who have authority to claim priority on
      available Internet communications facilities. This document only
      discusses the former - a request for help by an ordinary user answered
      at an emergency call center.
</p>
<p>Existing emergency call systems are organized locally/nationally; there are
      currently no international standards. However, the Internet does not
      respect national boundaries, and thus international standards for
      equipment and software required. To further complicate matters, VoIP
      endpoints can be connected through tunneling mechanisms such as virtual
      private networks (VPNs). This significantly complicates emergency
      calling, because the location of the caller and the first element that
      routes emergency calls can be on different continents, with different
      conventions and processes for handling of emergency calls.
</p>
<p>The IETF has historically refused to create national variants of its
      standards. Thus, this document attempts to take into account best
      practices that have evolved for circuit switched PSAPs, but makes no
      assumptions on particular operating practices currently in use,
      numbering schemes or organizational structures.
</p>
<p>This document discusses the use of the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) by PSAPs and calling parties.  While other inter-domain
    call signaling protocols may be used for emergency calling, SIP is
    ubiquitous and possesses, through its related specifications, more
    of the needed features for the proper support of this use case.
     Only protocols
      such as H.323, XMPP/Jingle, ISUP and SIP are suitable for inter-domain
      communications, ruling out master-slave protocols such as MGCP or
      H.248/Megaco. The latter protocols can naturally be used by the
      enterprise or carrier placing the call, but any such call would reach
      the PSAP through a media gateway controller, similar to how interdomain
      VoIP calls would be placed. Other signaling protocols may also use
      protocol translation to communicate with a SIP-enabled PSAP.
</p>
<p>Existing emergency services rely exclusively on voice and
      conventional text telephony (known as TTY in the United States) media
      streams. However, more choices of media offer additional ways to
      communicate and evaluate the situation as well as to assist callers and
      call takers to handle emergency calls. For example, instant messaging
      and video could improve the ability to communicate and evaluate the
      situation and to provide appropriate instruction prior to arrival of
      emergency crews. Thus, the architecture described here supports the
      creation of sessions of any media type, negotiated between the caller
      and PSAP using existing SIP protocol mechanisms <a class="info" href="#RFC3264">[RFC3264]<span> (</span><span class="info">Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>. To ensure that at least one common means of
      communications, this document recommends certain minimal capabilities in
      <a class="info" href="#I-D.rosen-sos-phonebcp">[I-D.rosen-sos-phonebcp]<span> (</span><span class="info">Rosen, B. and J. Polk, &ldquo;Best Current Practice for Communications Services in support of Emergency  Calling,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> that call taker user
      agents and PSAP-operated proxies should possess.
</p>
<p>This document does not prescribe the detailed network architecture
      for a PSAP or collection of PSAPs. For example, it does not describe
      where PSAPs may place firewalls or how many SIP proxies they should
      use.
</p>
<p>This document does not introduce any new SIP header fields, request
      methods, status codes, message bodies, or event packages. User agents
      unaware of the recommendations in this draft can place emergency calls,
      but may not be able to provide the same elevated user interface
      functionality. The document suggests behavior for proxy servers, in
      particular outbound proxy servers.

<p>We distinguish (<a class="info" href="#identifying">Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class="info">Identifying an Emergency Call</span><span>)</span></a>) an emergency
      call from any other call by a unique Service URN<a class="info" href="#I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn">[I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn]<span> (</span><span class="info">Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Services,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, which is placed in the
      initial call set-up signaling when a home or visited dialstring is
      detected. We route emergency calls based on the location <a class="info" href="#location">(<span> (</span><span class="info">Location and Its Role in an Emergency Call</span><span>)</span></a>) of the caller. To get this location we
      either include a form of measuring (e.g. GPS) <a class="info" href="#measured">(<span> (</span><span class="info">End-System Measured Location Information</span><span>)</span></a>) device location in the endpoint, or the
      endpoint acquires <a class="info" href="#acquisition">(<span> (</span><span class="info">End System Acquisition of Location</span><span>)</span></a>) its location from
      the access network. The location is conveyed <a class="info" href="#conveyance">(<span> (</span><span class="info">Conveyance of Location</span><span>)</span></a>) in the SIP signaling with the call. We
      route<a class="info" href="#routing">(<span> (</span><span class="info">Routing the Call to the PSAP</span><span>)</span></a>) the call based on location using

      maps a location to a set of PSAP URIs. Each URI resolves to a PSAP or an
      Emergency Services Routing Proxy which serves a group of PSAPs. The call
      arrives at the PSAP with the location included in the INVITE
      request.

<p><a class="info" href="#fig2">Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class="info">General Flow of an Emergency Call Establishment</span><span>)</span></a> shows a generic emergency call
      establishment. This includes the following: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Alice - who will make the emergency call.
</li>
<li>Configuration Servers - Servers providing Alice's
          UA its IP address and other configuration information, perhaps
          including Location by-value or by-reference. In this flow, we use DHCP as an example location
acquisition protocol. To make this flow
          easier to read, these configuration servers include a SIP Registrar
          server, for Alice's UA to register with the local domain, which will
          most likely be the case for an emergency call. All these
          configuration messages are labeled M1 through M4, but could easily
          require more messages than 4 to complete.
</li>
<li>ESRP - The Emergency Services Routing Proxy Server
          that recognizes any INVITE as an emergency session initiation, and
          does special things (knows to look for Location in the INVITE,
          dereferences a location-by-reference, initiated a LoST Query to
          learn the PSAP SIP(S)-URI for a UA at this location, etc).  ESRPs are optional elements
and in some jurisdictions an emergency call may not pass through one
</li>
<li>Mapping Server - Processes the LoST request for Location to
          PSAP-URI Mapping function, either for an initial request from a UA,
          or an in-call establishment request by an ESRP.
</li>
<li>PSAP - Call center where emergency calls are destined for in times of
          emergencies.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, Alice's UA either has location configured within her UA
      when her UA boots, or she configures it with location once it boots up,
      or her UA receives measured location from the network. Her UA may have
      asked for location during boot-time, for example in a DHCPREQUEST
      message or another location acquisition mechanism. Alice's UA then will
      most likely register with a SIP domain. This allows her to be contacted
      by other SIP entities. Next, her UA will perform an initial LoST
      Location-to-PSAP SIP(S)-URI query to learn an early URI, for use if the
      Lost Query fails during an emergency call. This learned early PSAP-URI
      will be placed in a Route header within an emergency INVITE message,
      message [M7] in Figure 1.
</p>
<p>Some time has hopefully passed since Alice's UA booted. In this
      example, she dials or initiated an emergency call. This may have been
      through her keypad with her locally known emergency dialstring. It is
      important that this dialstring be recognized by her UA wherever Alice is
      because she may be in enough distress she forgets what the traveled-to
      emergency dialstring is; as there are more than 60 around the world.
</p>
<p>This emergency INVITE arrives at a SIP Proxy that understands the
      concept of emergency calling, meaning it is an ESRP. In recognizing the
      INVITE as an emergency call set-up, the ESRP looks for Location within
      the message. <a class="info" href="#I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance">[I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance]<span> (</span><span class="info">Polk, J. and B. Rosen, &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol Location Conveyance,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>
      defines a SIP Location header that either contain the
      location-by-reference URI, or a <a class="info" href="#RFC2396">[RFC2396]<span> (</span><span class="info">Berners-Lee, T., Fielding, R., and L. Masinter, &ldquo;Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> "cid:"
      indicating where in the message body the location-by-value is. The ESRP
      can dereference the UA provided Location URI, and insert the location information
      from the PIDF-LO into the LoST query. This will prevent any problems of the LoST
      Mapping server experiencing dereferencing problems with this request.
      This is message [M7] and [M8] in Figure 1. The LoST response provides
      the ESRP with the freshest PSAP-URI for that location (of Alice's UA)
      for the most up to date routing choice. This is message [M9].
</p>
<p>The INVITE message receives a new Request-URI in the ESRP, which was
      returned in the LoST response. This message, [M10] is transmitted
      towards the most current PSAP for Alice's location. Message [M11], the
      200 OK to the INVITE may traverse one or more proxies if they chose
      insert a Record-Route header, or if one or more are B2BUAs. Figure 1
      does not show this. The ACK completes the call set-up and the emergency
      call is established, allowing the PSAP call-taker to talk to Alice about
      her emergency.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;Identifying an Emergency Call</h3>

<p>Using the PSTN, emergency help can often be summoned by dialing a
      nationally designated, widely known number, regardless of where the
      telephone was purchased. The appropriate number is determined by which
      infrastructure the telephone is connected to. However, this number
      differs between localities, even though it is often the same for a
      country or region, such as many countries in the European Union. In some
      countries, there is a single digit sequence that is used for all types
      of emergencies. In others, there are several sequences that are specific
      to the responder, e.g., one for police, another for fire. It is deemed
      impractical to change the dialed digits to summon help. For end systems,
      it is desirable to have a universal identifier, independent of location,
      to allow the automated inclusion of location information and to allow
      the device and other entities in the call path to perform appropriate
      processing within the signaling protocol in an emergency call
      set-up.
</p>
<p>As part of the overall emergency calling architecture, we define
      common emergency call URIs which are defined in <a class="info" href="#I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn">[I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn]<span> (</span><span class="info">Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Services,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. Users are not expected to
      "dial" an emergency URN. Rather, the current dial sequence should be
      translated to the appropriate service URN. Such translation could
      ideally be performed in the endpoint, but could be performed in a
      signaling intermediary (proxy server). For devices that are mobile or
      nomadic, an issue arises of whether the home or visited dialing strings
      should be used. Many users would prefer that their home dialing
      sequences work no matter where they are. Local laws and preferences of
      the emergency response professionals are that the visited dialing
      sequences be used. The best answer seems to be for both to work.
</p>
<p>The mechanism for obtaining the dialing sequences for a given
      location is provided by LoST <a class="info" href="#I-D.hardie-ecrit-lost">[I-D.hardie-ecrit-lost]<span> (</span><span class="info">Hardie, T., &ldquo;LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> and the procedures for the
      translation are detailed in <a class="info" href="#I-D.rosen-sos-phonebcp">[I-D.rosen-sos-phonebcp]<span> (</span><span class="info">Rosen, B. and J. Polk, &ldquo;Best Current Practice for Communications Services in support of Emergency  Calling,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. Where the endpoint does not
      support the translation of dialstrings to telephone numbers, the dialing
      sequence would be represented as a dialstring <a class="info" href="#I-D.rosen-iptel-dialstring">[I-D.rosen-iptel-dialstring]<span> (</span><span class="info">Rosen, B., &ldquo;Dialstring parameter for the Session Initiation Protocol URI,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>If the endpoint recognizes the dialstring, the service URN would
      appear in the To: field. If it does not, the dialstring would appear. If
      a proxy detects the emergency dialstring, it would, if it does not also
      perform the location mapping, place the service URN in the Request-URI
      and/or a Route header.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1"></a><h3>5.1.&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p>Caller location plays a central role in routing emergency calls.
        For practical reasons, each PSAP generally handles only calls for a
        certain geographic area (overload arrangements between PSAPs to handle each others calls notwithstanding). 
Other calls that reach it by accident must be
        manually re-routed (transferred) to the appropriate PSAP, increasing
        call handling delay and the chance for errors. The area covered by
        each PSAP differs by jurisdiction, where some countries have only a
        small number of PSAPs, while others decentralize PSAP responsibilities
        to the level of counties or municipalities.
</p>
<p>In most cases, PSAPs cover at least a city or town, but there are
        some areas where PSAP coverage areas follow old telephone rate center
        boundaries and may straddle more than one city. Irregular boundaries
        are common, often for historical reasons. Routing must be done on PSAP
        service boundaries, not "closest" or "best fit" algorithms.

<a name="rfc.section.5.2"></a><h3>5.2.&nbsp;Types of Location Information</h3>

<p>There are four primary types of location information: civic,
        postal, geospatial, and cellular cell tower and sector.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Civic:</dt>
<dd>Civic location information describes the
            location of a person or object by a street address that
            corresponds to a building or other structure. (This is sometimes
            also called "civil" location information.) Civic location may
            include more finer grained location information such as floor,
            room, cubicle. Civic information comes in two forms: 
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Jurisdictional -</dt>
<dd>This refers to a civic location
                using actual political subdivisions, especially for the
                community name.
</dd>
<dt>Postal -</dt>
<dd>This refers to a civic location used to
                mail a letter to. The name of the post office sometimes does
                not correspond to the actual community name and a postal
                addrress may contain post office boxes or street addresses
                that do not correspond to an actual building. Postal addresses
                are generally unsuitable for emergency call routing, but may
                be the only address available.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>Geospatial:</dt>
<dd>Geospatial addresses contain longitude,
            latitude and altitude information based on an understood datum
            (starting point) and earth shape model. While there have been many
            datums developed over time, most modern systems are using or
            moving towards WGS84.
</dd>
<dt>Cell tower/sector:</dt>
<dd>Cell tower and sectors identify
            the cell tower and the antenna sector that the mobile device is
            currently using. Cell/sector information could also be transmitted
            as an irregularly shaped polygon of geospatial coordinates
            reflecting the likely geospatial location of the mobile device,
            but since these boundaries are not sharp, transmitting the raw
            information is probably preferable.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>In IETF protocols, civic and geo forms are both supported. The
        civic forms include both the postal and jurisdictional fields. The
        cell tower/sector can be represented as a polygon.

<a name="rfc.section.5.3"></a><h3>5.3.&nbsp;Location Determination</h3>

<p>Location information can be entered by the user or installer of a
        device ("manual configuration"), can be measured by the end system,
        can be delivered to the end system by some protocol or can be measured
        by a third party and inserted into the call signaling. We discuss
        these in detail below.
</p>
<p>In some cases, an entity may have multiple sources of location
        information, possibly partially contradictory. This is particularly
        likely if the location information is determined both by the end
        system and a third party. Handling multiple locations is discussed in
        XRef??. Conflicting location information is particularly harmful if it
        points to multiple distinct PSAPs. Guidelines for dealing with
        multiple locations is given in <a class="info" href="#I-D.rosen-sos-phonebcp">[I-D.rosen-sos-phonebcp]<span> (</span><span class="info">Rosen, B. and J. Polk, &ldquo;Best Current Practice for Communications Services in support of Emergency  Calling,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>All location objects MUST be delivered to the PSAP. To facilitate
        such policy decisions, location information should contain information
        about the source of data, such as GPS, manually entered or based on
        access network topology. In addition, the generator of the location
        information should be included.
</p>
<p>The call should indicate which location information has been used
        for routing, so that the same location information is used for all
        call routing decisions. Otherwise, two proxies might pick different
        location information from the call request, resulting in different
        routing decisions for different transactions.
</p>
<p>End systems and network elements can derive location information
        from a variety of sources. It is not the goal of this document to
        exhaustively enumerate them, but we provide a few common examples in
        the sections below.

<a name="rfc.section.5.3.1"></a><h3>5.3.1.&nbsp;User-Entered Location Information</h3>

<p>Location information can be maintained by the end user or the
          installer of an endpoint in the endpoint itself, or in a
          database.
</p>
<p>Location information added by end users is almost always inferior
          to measured or wire database information, as users may mistype civic
          location information, may not know the meaning of geospatial
          coordinates or may use address information that does not correspond
          to a recognized civic address. A user-entered location can fail to
          be changed when the location of a device changes during or after
          movement. For example, a user could move their residence to another
          dwelling, not update their device/equipment with this new location,
          and place an emergency call with old location information.
</p>
<p>All that said, there are always a small number of cases where the
          mechanisms used by the access network to determine location fail to
          accurately reflect the actual location of the endpoint. For example,
          the user may deploy his own WAN behind an access network,
          effectively remoting an endpoint some distance from the access
          network's notion of its location. There must be some mechanism
          provided to provision a location for an endpoint by the user or by
          the access network on behalf of a user. As an aside, normally, if an
          emergency caller insists he is at a location different from what any
          automatic location determination system reports he is, responders
          will always be sent to the user's self-declared location. However this is a matter of local policy and is outside the scope of this document.

<a name="rfc.section.5.3.2"></a><h3>5.3.2.&nbsp;Access Network &quot;Wire Database&quot; Location Information</h3>

<p>Location information can be maintained by the access network,
          relating some form of identifier for the end subscriber or device to
          a location database ("wire database"). In enterprise LANs, wiremap
          databases map Ethernet switch ports to building layouts at known
          locations. In DSL installations, the local telephone carrier
          maintains a mapping of wire-pairs to subscriber addresses.
</p>
<p>Even for IEEE 802.11 wireless access points, wire databases may
          provide sufficient location resolution; the location of the access
          point may be sufficient location information for each of the clients
          served by that access point. This may be the connectivity type for
          both residential users of DSL and Cable Modem installations, as well
          as the only infrastructure at a WiFi hotspot, such as a coffee shop.
          Each of these cases will have a known civic address of the
          dwelling/business, likely providing sufficient location
          resolution.
</p>
<p>Wire databases to the home are likely to be the most promising
          solution for residential users where a service provider knows the
          customer's service address. The service provider can then perform
          address verification, similar to the current system in some
          jurisdictions.

<p>Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors may be embedded directly
          in the end device. GPS 
produces relatively high precision location fixes in open-sky conditions, but the technology still faces 
several challenges in terms of performance (time-to-fix and time-to-first-fix), as well as obtaining successful location fixes within shielded structures, or underneath the ground (tunnels, basements, etc.).  
It also requires all devices to be equipped with the appropriate GPS capability.  GPS technology is improving,
          and is increasingly successful in more difficult conditions such as
          dense urban canyons and inside commercial structures. It is
          currently accurate to tens of meters using some kind of "assist",
          which may be operated by the access network (A-GPS) or by a
          government (WAAS). Newer multi-frequency systems will improve
          accuracy without assist.
</p>
<p> GPS equipped devices vary depending on which element intitiates requests, which element actually determines final location,
assist mechanisms, etc.  Some common implementations
include:

<p>Other protocols may be devised by other standards bodies.
        For endpoints with common network connections (such as an Ethernet
        jack or a WiFi connection), unless every network supported every
        protocol, or alternatively, every device supported every protocol,
        serious incompatibilities would ensue. <a class="info" href="#I-D.rosen-sos-phonebcp">[I-D.rosen-sos-phonebcp]<span> (</span><span class="info">Rosen, B. and J. Polk, &ldquo;Best Current Practice for Communications Services in support of Emergency  Calling,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> contains a (short) list of
        protocols such devices must support.
</p>
<p>Where an access network can control the specification of EVERY
        endpoint that could make an emergency call that is directly connected
        to the network, or indirectly connected (for example, a device on a
        LAN behind a network attachment unit), it may specify any protocol it
        wishes for each endpoint. This is a very unusual case; nearly every
        access network can be used to support an Ethernet based LAN behind it.
        For example, existing mobile networks are being used to support
        routers and LANs behind a wireless data network WAN connection. It is
        possible that the access network supports a protocol not on the
        phonebcp list, but another element which the access network provider
        controls the specification of can acquire location using that protocol
        and then that element can support one of the phonebcp's list of
        protocols. For example, if the access network provider supplies a
        router which includes a DHCP server, it can acquire location using an
        access network specific protocol, and use the location information to
        supply it to its clients via DHCP.
</p>
<p>Location for non-mobile devices is normally expected to be acquired
        at network attachment time and retained by the device. It should be
        refreshed when the cached value becomes invalid
        (for example, if DHCP is the acquisition
        protocol, refresh of location may occur when the IP address lease is
        renewed). At the time of an emergency call, the location should be
        refreshed, with the retained location used if the location acquisition
        does not immediately return a value. Mobile devices may determine
        location at network attachment time and periodically thereafter as a backup in case
        location determination at the time of call does not work.  Mobile device location may be refreshed when a TTL expires,
the device moves beyond some boundaries, etc.
        Normally, mobile devices will acquire its location at call time for use in an emergency call, but see

<a name="rfc.section.5.6"></a><h3>5.6.&nbsp;Conveyance of Location</h3>

<p>When an emergency call is placed, the endpoint (normally) puts
        location information in the signaling with the call. We refer to that
        as "conveyance" to distinguish it from "acquisition". Acquisition gets
        location from access network to endpoint, conveyance sends location
        from endpoint to elements that route the call based on that location
        object and the PSAP. Using SIP, the location information is conveyed
        following the procedures in <a class="info" href="#I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance">[I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance]<span> (</span><span class="info">Polk, J. and B. Rosen, &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol Location Conveyance,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. The form of the
        location information obtained by the acquisition protocol may not be
        the same as the conveyance protocol uses (PIDF-LO <a class="info" href="#RFC4119">[RFC4119]<span> (</span><span class="info">Peterson, J., &ldquo;A Presence-based GEOPRIV Location Object Format,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>). Conversion by the endpoint may be
        required.
</p>
<p>For emergency call purposes, conversion of location information
        from civic to geo or vice versa is not desirable. The location should
        be sent in the form it was determined. The PSAP may convert, if it
        needs to, and if conversion resulted from an earlier conversion,
        unacceptable errors may be introduced.

<a name="rfc.section.5.7"></a><h3>5.7.&nbsp;Location Updates</h3>

<p>Location information may not be available at call setup time for
        mobile devices. For example, if a GPS-enabled cell phone is turned on
        and then immediately places an emergency call, it can take significant
        additional time before the cell phone acquires a GPS fix and
        its location. Thus, while it is desirous to base emergency routing on precise caller 
location information, it is not possible in all circumstances to do so. In some cases, the initial call setup
        will proceed based on, for example, cell and sector information and
        then add location information during the call, rather than delaying
        the initial call setup by an unacceptable amount of time.
</p>
<p>In addition, the location of a mobile caller, e.g., in a vehicle or
        aircraft, can change significantly during the emergency call. The PSAP
        must be able to get updated location information while it is
        processing the call.
</p>
<p>Location updates may be conveyed either in a re-INVITE or UPDATE
        <a class="info" href="#RFC3311">[RFC3311]<span> (</span><span class="info">Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) UPDATE Method,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> request message (where UPDATE is

<a name="rfc.section.5.8"></a><h3>5.8.&nbsp;Location Validation</h3>

<p>Location must be validated prior to a device placing an actual
        emergency call. Validation in this context means both that there is a
        mapping from the address to a PSAP and that the PSAP understands how
        to direct responders to the location. This is not as easy as it
        sounds. There are, for example, many cases of two names for the same
        street, or two streets with the same name in a city. In some
        countries, the current system provides validation. For example, in the
        United States, the Master Street Address Guide (MSAG) records all
        valid street addresses and is used to ensure that phone billing
        records correspond to valid emergency service street addresses.
        Validation is normally a concern for civic addresses, although there
        could be a concern that a given geo is within at least one PSAP
        service boundary; that is, a "valid" geo is one for which there is a
        mapping.

        includes a validation function. Validation should ideally be performed
        when a location is entered into a Location Information Server (which
        is normally a provisioning mechanism in the access carrier's operation
        and support system). It should be confirmed periodically, because the
        mapping database undergoes slow change; new streets are added or
        removed, community names change, postal codes change, etc. Test
        functions (<a class="info" href="#test">Section&nbsp;13<span> (</span><span class="info">Testing</span><span>)</span></a>) should also re-validate.

<p>Occasionally, a failure may occur where the access network cannot
        determine the actual location of the caller. In these cases, it must
        supply a default location. The default location should be as accurate
        as the network can determine. For example, in a cable network, a
        default location for each CMTS, with a representative location for all
        cable modems served by that CMTS could be provided if the network is
        unable to resolve the subscriber to any unit less than the CMTS.
        Default locations must be marked as such (how?) so that the PSAP knows
        that the location is not accurate.

<a name="rfc.section.6"></a><h3>6.&nbsp;Routing the Call to the PSAP</h3>

<p>Emergency calls are routed based on one or more of the following
      criteria expressed in the call setup request (INVITE):
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Location:</dt>
<dd>Since each PSAP serves a limited geographic
          region and transferring existing calls delays the emergency
          response, calls need to be routed to the most appropriate PSAP. In
          this architecture, emergency call setup requests contain location
          information, expressed in civic or geospatial coordinates, that
          allows such routing. If there is no or imprecise (e.g., cell tower
          and sector) information at call setup time, an on-going emergency
          call may also be transferred to another PSAP based on location
          information that becomes available in mid-call.
</dd>
<dt>Type of emergency service:</dt>
<dd>In some jurisdictions,
          emergency calls for fire, police, ambulance or mountain rescue are
          directed to just those emergency-specific PSAPs. We support this
          mechanism by optionally labeling calls with a service identifier
          <a class="info" href="#I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn">[I-D.ietf-ecrit-service-urn]<span> (</span><span class="info">Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Services,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</dd>
<dt>Media capabilities of caller:</dt>
<dd>In some cases, emergency
          call centers for specific caller media preferences, such as typed
          text or video, are separate from voice systems. Also, even if media
          capability does not affect the selection of the PSAP, there may be
          call takers within the PSAP that are specifically trained, e.g., in
          interactive text or sign language communications. Again, we use the

          and route such calls.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>Routing for calls by location and by service is the primary function
      LoST <a class="info" href="#I-D.hardie-ecrit-lost">[I-D.hardie-ecrit-lost]<span> (</span><span class="info">Hardie, T., &ldquo;LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> provides. LoST accepts
      a query with location (by-value) in either civic or geo form, plus a
      service identifier, and returns an xml data structure containing a URI
      (or set of URIs) to route the call to. Normal SIP <a class="info" href="#RFC3261">[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class="info">Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> routing functions are used to resolve the URI
      to a next hop destination.
</p>
<p>The endpoint can complete the LoST mapping from its location at boot
      time, and periodically thereafter. It should attempt to obtain a "fresh"
      location, and from that a current mapping when it places an emergency
      call, and if accessing either its location acquisition function or
      mapping function fails, it should use this cached value. The call would
      follow its normal outbound call processing, setting the 'To:' header to
      the service URN, and placing the mapping result URI in a Route header.
      Most implementations would also have the mapping result in the
      Request-URI. If the endpoint does not perform mapping on its location,
      it should set the Request-URI to the service URN.
</p>
<p>Each proxy receiving an emergency call request, identified as
      described in <a class="info" href="#identifying">Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class="info">Identifying an Emergency Call</span><span>)</span></a>, in the Request-URI it
      should assume that the endpoint did not map the location, and it should
      attempt mapping.
</p>
<p>With the URI obtained from mapping, whether by the endpoint or the
      proxy, the proxy routes the call. There are three types of routing
      actions: default routing, SIP routing and local routing. Not all routing
      actions can take all three dimensions (location, type of service,
      capabilities) into account.
</p>
<p>ESRPs and user agents using default routing forward all emergency
      call requests to one designated ESRP, regardless of the location of the
      caller, type of service or media capabilities. Default routing is always
      used when no location is available, or routing to all of the URIs
      received from mapping fail.

<p>Finally, an ESRP may use a local database or other query protocols to
      perform call routing using location, type of service or callee
      capabilities. The details of such a database are beyond the scope of
      this document.
</p>
<p>Call routing may combine several of these methods. For example, an
      outbound proxy might route all emergency calls to a designated ESRP.
      This then uses LoST with both the service type and the location. That
      may route to a region, state or country level ESRP which uses the user
      part of the URI that it receives, PSAP status and congestion information
      to route to a PSAP.
</p>
<p>If an emergency call INVITE request does not contain location
      information and no other location hints (such as subscriber identity)
      are available, the first ESRP in the call path should route it to a PSAP
      or group of PSAPs that is geographically local to that proxy, since no
      other call routing can be performed.
</p>
<p>Jurisdictions organizing PSAPs may choose to implement multiple
      levels of routing based on location. For example, a state, province or
      county might deploy an ESRP in front of a collection of PSAPs. The
      information available to a VoIP carrier or enterprise ESRP may be
      coarse, so that any location within the state or province gets routed to
      that representative ESRP, with that ESRP performing the detailed routing
      to a specific PSAP. The routing mechanism used by the ESRP may nor may
      not rely on public information. Depending on choices made by the
      operator of the PSAP and ESRP, the PSAP may only be reachable by SIP
      requests routed through the ESRP.

<p>Since emergency calls carry privacy-sensitive information, they are
      subject to the requirements for geospatial protocols <a class="info" href="#RFC3693">[RFC3693]<span> (</span><span class="info">Cuellar, J., Morris, J., Mulligan, D., Peterson, J., and J. Polk, &ldquo;Geopriv Requirements,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> . In particular,
      signaling information should be carried in TLS, i.e., in 'sips' mode.  While requiring TLS is actually the way
the standards are written, it is unacceptable to have an emergency call fail to complete because a TLS connection was
not created, for any reason.  In many cases, persistant TLS connections can be maintained between elements to minimize the time
needed to establish them.

<p>The call-taker must be able to reach the emergency caller if the
      original call is disconnected. In traditional emergency calls, wireline
      and wireless emergency calls include a callback identifier for this
      purpose. In SIP systems, the caller should include a Contact header
      field indicating its device URI, if available, or possibly a GRUU<a class="info" href="#I-D.ietf-sip-gruu">[I-D.ietf-sip-gruu]<span> (</span><span class="info">Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent (UA) URIs (GRUU) in the  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> if calls need to be routed via a
      proxy. This identifier would be used to initiate call-backs immediately
      by the call-taker if, for example, the call is prematurely dropped.
</p>
<p>In addition, a call-back identifier should be included either as the
      URI in the From header field <a class="info" href="#RFC3261">[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class="info">Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E.

This identity would be used to initiate a call-back at a later
      time and may reach the caller, not necessarily on the same device (and
      at the same location) as the original emergency call.
</p>
<p>Finally, there may be two other call identifiers included in an
      emergency call. An identifier may be included which can be used to
      identify the caller, as opposed to the device or the subscriber of a
      specific calling service. This identifier may be used to retrieve
      information about the caller that is independent of calling service. For
      example, Alice may have home, office and mobile telephony services, but
      she is the same Alice in all of them. Information about Alice may be
      kept by an entity independent of any telephony service provider. The
      caller identity is a URI and is placed in a SIP Call-Info header <a class="info" href="#RFC3261">[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class="info">Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E.

      recommendations in ???.
</p>
<p>The communications service provider may also include an identifier
      that may be used to retrieve information specific to the call held by
      the service provider. This identifier, also a URI may be placed in the
      Call-Info header using the token "?".

<a name="rfc.section.13.1"></a><h3>13.1.&nbsp;Testing Mechanism</h3>

<p>Since the emergency calling architecture consists of a number of
        pieces operated by independent entities, it is important to be able to
        test whether an emergency call is likely to succeed without actually
        occupying the human resources at a PSAP. Both signaling and media
        paths need to be tested since NATs and firewalls may allow the session
        setup request to reach the PSAP, while preventing the exchange of
        media.
</p>
<p>INVITE requests to a service urn with a urn parameter of "test"
        indicates a request for an automated test. For example,
        "urn:service.sos.fire;test". As in standard SIP, a 200 (OK) response
        indicates that the address was recognized and a 404 (Not found) that
        it was not. A 486 (Busy Here) should be returned if the test service
        is busy, and a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) should be returned if the
        PSAP does not support the test mechanism.
</p>
<p>In its response to the test, the PSAP may include a text body
        indicating the identity of the PSAP, the requested service, and the
        location reported with the call. For the latter, the PSAP should
        return location-by-value even if the original location delivered with
        the test was by-reference.
</p>
<p>A PSAP accepting a test call should accept a media loopback
        test<a class="info" href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-media-loopback">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-media-loopback]<span> (</span><span class="info">Hedayat, K., &ldquo;An Extension to the Session Description Protocol (SDP) for Media Loopback,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> and should
        support the "rtp-pkt-loopback" and "rtp-start-loopback" options. The
        user agent would specify a loopback attribute of "loopback-source",
        the PSAP being the mirror. User Agents should expect the PSAP to loop
        back no more than 3 packets of each media type accepted, after which
        the PSAP would normally send BYE.
</p>
<p>User agents should perform a full call test, including media
        loopback to after a disconnect and subsequent change in IP address, as
        the NAT configuration may have changed.
</p>
<p>User agents must not place a test call immediately after booting,
        as a widespread power outage and subsequent restoration would impose
        an inordinate load on the emergency call routing system.
</p>
<p>PSAPs may refuse repeated requests for test from the same device in
        a short period of time.

<a name="rfc.section.15.1"></a><h3>15.1.&nbsp;tel URIs</h3>

<p>Instead of providing URIs to call routing proxies or end systems,
        it has been suggested that end systems be configured with a "tel" URI
        <a class="info" href="#RFC3966">[RFC3966]<span> (</span><span class="info">Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;The tel URI for Telephone Numbers,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>. Such a "tel" URI would have to be
        routed to a geographically appropriate telephony gateway, as it is
        unlikely that every building, enterprise or residence will have its
        own gateway. VoIP devices can be used in networks that are completely
        unaware of VoIP services, with VoIP service providers that are
        physically far removed from the caller's network location. Thus, the
        use of a tel URI simply moves the problem to the outbound proxy, which
        has to use the caller's location to determine the appropriate
        telephony gateway.
</p>
<p>In addition, emergency telephone numbers are far from universal,
        with some such numbers used for non-emergency purposes elsewhere.
        Thus, an outbound proxy would have to ascertain the location of the
        caller to guess whether the "tel" URI identifies an emergency call or
        some other number.
</p>
<p>Thus, "tel" URIs are not likely to be appropriate or sufficient for
        identifying emergency calls and do not, by themselves, solve the call
        routing problem.

<a name="rfc.section.16.1"></a><h3>16.1.&nbsp;Caller Authentication</h3>

<p>Authentication is broken out to into two parts: authentication of
end devices and authentication of end users.  If all emergency calls are to handled in
some way, 
authentication of either case should not be required, but may be
recommended to prevent 
or reduce fraudulent calls into a PSAP.  While it is possible to
authenticate either the 
device or user, the most common approach is to authenticate the end user
only.  A 
requirement to authenticate carries with it the risk of disallowing an
emergency call 
altogether.  Mechanisms such
        as the <a class="info" href="#RFC3893">RFC3893<span> (</span><span class="info">Peterson, J., &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Authenticated Identity Body (AIB) Format,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3893] may be used to assert
        identities.
</p>
<p>In keeping with established customs in circuit-switched emergency
        calling, authentication cannot be made a prerequisite for routing or
        accepting an emergency call. However, a call taker may be more
        suspicious of a caller and request additional information if the call
        authenticity cannot be verified.

<p>Location is sensitive information, it must be protected against
        disclosure to unauthorized persons. In most jurisdictions placing an
        emergency call implies disclosure of location to all the entities
        needing location to properly route and respond to the call.
        Nevertheless, even in an emergency, callers have an expectation that
        their location will not be divulged outside of that implied
        release.
</p>
<p>During acquisition of the location information, an eavesdropper or
        impersonator may obtain location. When DHCP is used, authentication

</p>
<p>With LoST-based call routing (<a class="info" href="#routing">Section&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class="info">Routing the Call to the PSAP</span><span>)</span></a>), an
        attacker could modify the mapping entries for one or more locations,

        provisioning the data in the LoST database must be robust.
</p>
<p>LoST is a distributed database, with many replicas of authoritative
        data. An attacker may impersonate a valid LoST server and supply
        fraudulent data. An attacker may also perpetrate a denial of service
        attack on LoST servers. These issues are addressed in <a class="info" href="#I-D.hardie-ecrit-lost">[I-D.hardie-ecrit-lost]<span> (</span><span class="info">Hardie, T., &ldquo;LoST: A Location-to-Service Translation Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Finally, the URI LoST returns would normally contain a domain name.
        The domain can be hijacked by several known attacks. TLS should be
