Internet-Draft           OSPFv3 Graceful Restart            October 2007


1.  Introduction

   Graceful OSPF restart [GRACE] describes a mechanism to restart the
   control plane of an OSPFv2 [OSPFv2] router while leaving the
   forwarding plane intact and minimizing disruption to other OSPF
   routers in the network.

   In general, the methods described in [GRACE] work for OSPFv3 [OSPFv3]
   as well.  However, OSPFv3 will use a different grace LSA to signal
   that a router is (or is about) to attempt a graceful restart.  This
   document describes other OSPFv3 differences as well.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Grace Link State Advertisement

   Grace-LSAs are originated by an OSPFv3 router that wishes to perform
   a graceful restart of its OSPFv3 software.  A grace-LSA requests that
   the router's neighbors aid in its graceful restart by continuing to
   advertise the router as fully adjacent during a specified grace
   period.  The grace-LSA contains the restarting router's grace-period
   and a reason code indicating the reason for the graceful restart.

   In OSPFv3 (refer 2.11 of [OSPFv3]), neighboring routers on a given
   link are always identified by router ID.  This contrasts with the
   IPv4 behavior where neighbors on point-to-point networks and virtual
   links are identified by their Router IDs, and neighbors on broadcast,
   NBMA and point-to-multipoint links are identified by their IPv4
   interface addresses.  Consequently, there is no requirement for the
   router-address TLV used for OSPFv3 graceful restart [GRACE].

   The grace-LSA body format will remain the same as described in
   [GRACE].

2.1.  Grace LSA - LS Type

   A grace-LSA is defined as link-local scope LSA with the LS type equal
   to 0x000b.

          LSA function code  LS Type  Description
          ------------------------------------------
          11                 0x000b   Grace LSA

                                 LSA Type

   The U-bit is set to 0 to since this is a link local scoped LSA and
   the flooding scope is not impacted by whether or not the LSA is
   known.  The S2-bit and S1-bit are also set to 0 to indicate link-
   local flooding scope.

2.2.  Grace LSA Format

   The format of a grace LSA format is:

     0                   1                   2                   3

    +-                            TLVs                             -+

                             Grace LSA Format

   The Link State ID of a grace-LSA in OSPFv3 is the interface ID of the
   interface the LSA is originated on.

   The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets
   (thus a TLV with no value portion would have a length of zero).  The
   TLV is padded to four-octet alignment; padding is not included in the
   length field (so a three octet value would have a length of three,
   but the total size of the TLV would be eight octets).  Nested TLVs
   are also 32-bit aligned.  For example, a one-octet value would have
   the length field set to 1, and three octets of padding would be added
   to the end of the value portion of the TLV.  Unrecognized types are
   ignored.

   The format of each TLV is:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |              Type             |             Length            |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                            Value...                           |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                TLV Format

Internet-Draft           OSPFv3 Graceful Restart            October 2007


   The format of the TLVs within the body of a grace-LSA is the same as
   the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF
   [OSPF-TE].  The TLV header consists of a 16-bit Type field and a 16-
   bit length field.  The header is followed by zero or more octets of
   value.  The length field indicates the length of the value portion in
   octets.  The value portion is padded to four-octet alignment, but the
   padding is not included in the length field.

   The following is the list of TLVs that can appear in the body of a
   grace-LSA.

   o  Grace Period (Type=1, length=4).  The number of seconds that the
      router's neighbors should continue to advertise the router as
      fully adjacent, regardless of the state of database
      synchronization between the router and its neighbors.  This TLV
      MUST always appear in a grace-LSA.

   o  Graceful restart reason (Type=2, length=1).  Encodes the reason
      for the router restart, as one of the following: 0 (unknown), 1
      (software restart), 2 (software reload/upgrade) or 3 (switch to
      redundant control processor).  This TLV MUST always appear in a
      grace-LSA.

3.  Additional Considerations for OSPFv3 Graceful Restart

   This section describes OSPFv3 unique considerations in addition to
   those described in [GRACE].

3.1.  Preservation of LSA ID to Prefix Correspondence

   In OSPFv2 there is a direct correspondence between type 3 and type 5
   LSA IDs and the prefixes being advertised.  For OSPFv3, the LSA ID
   for inter-area prefix LSAs and external LSAs is simply an unsigned 32
   bit integer.  To avoid network churn during graceful restart, the
   restarting router SHOULD preserve the LSA ID to prefix correspondence
   across graceful restarts.

3.2.  Preservation of Interface IDs for Link-LSAs, Network LSAs,  and
      Router-LSAs

   The OSPFv3 interface ID, as described in section 3.1.2 [OSPFv3], MUST
   be preserved by the restarting router across restarts.  It is used as
   the LSA ID for link-LSAs and network-LSAs and is included in the link
   descriptions in router-LSAs.  Failure to preserve interface IDs would
   result in a mismatch between the restarting router's pre-restart LSAs
   and its neighbor adjacency state.  This, in turn, would make
   synchronizing an interface ID change between the restarting router
   and its helping routers much more difficult (if not impossible) and
   would most likely result in unreachability or premature graceful
   restart termination.  Placing the burden on the restarting router to
   preserve interface IDs across restarts provides for a more robust,
   more deterministic, and simpler mechanism.

   Many implementations are using the interface's Interface Group MIB
   IfIndex ([INTFMIB]) for Interface ID and are already preserving it
   across restarts.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document doesn't raise any new security concerns other than
   those covered in [OSPFv3], [OSPFv3-AUTH], and [GRACE].  This is based
   on the fact that [OSPFv3-AUTH] relies on manually key distribution
   which precludes the use of replay protection utilizing sequence
   numbers.

5.  IANA Considerations

   A new LSA function code will be required for the OSPFv3 grace LSA.
   Assignment of 0x000b has been suggested herein.  Grace LSA TLVs and
   sub-TLVs will share the same IANA registry as the TLVs and sub-TLVs
   used by the OSPFv2 grace opaque LSA.
