<section title="Requirements Notation">
  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
  "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
  and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
  described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="Intro" title="Introduction">

<t>There is a constant an ongoing effort to investigate and analyse the global internet routing system from many 
	different perspectives. One perspective is related to the geographical position of <xref target="RFC4271">BGP</xref> speakers and the terrestrial location 
	of the route propagation. Recording of such information by passive BGP listeners in MRT format is 
	described in the <xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-geomrt">MRT BGP routing information export format with geo-location extensions</xref>.
	There are of course many other efforts external to the IETF and won't be described here. Further awareness of these efforts is left to the reader.
</t>

<t>This document describes the construction, use, and interpretation of the RPKI-GEO record. This record provides first class informational 
    	attestations pertaining to the geographical attributes relating to the information described in RPKI objects. The use of the geographical 
    	data is of an informational nature
    	and provides a consistent and validatable approach to asserting the location properties of any item described by an RPKI object. To maintain consistency implementers 
    	and readers should condier the 9 rules in section 3 of <xref target="RFC5491"></xref>.
 </t>

<t>It is not intended that the RPKI object described herein be used to directly influence routing or forwarding decisions. 
	Its creation by any certificate maintainer is to be interpreted as informational and any replying party should only use the knowledge in the
	efforts of routing research or anomaly detection.
 </t>
 
 <t>The geographic attestations made in this object are made by the certificate maintainer and their validity and accuracy 
 	is in the hands of the certificate maintainer. 
 	It is left to the relying party as how much trust is given to the geographic data provided by the certificate maintainer.</t>
 
 <t>The RPKI-GEO object pertains only to the objects at the same RPKI repository publication point where it itself is published.</t>

<section anchor="validation" title="RPKI-GEO Validation">

   <t>After the generic signed objects validation <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidr-signed-object"></xref> has been performed, the Version number field
   within the payload is checked.  The payload data is checked against the profile
   defined in this document.  All of these checks MUST pass for the RPKI-GEO payload to be considered valid and made available for use.</t>
   
</section>

<section anchor="Interpretation" title="RPKI-GEO interpretation">
<t>A common sense interpretation of location data should prevail based on the type of the data that is represented in the RPKI object. For example a 
	RPKI-GEO object that provides location information for a ROA would attest to the geographical location where the route is originated from. That may 
	be the originating BGP speaker(s) as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-geomrt"></xref>. Similarly the location information associated with a 
	 <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidr-ghostbusters">Ghostbusters record</xref> would describe the geographical location of the entity described in the Ghostbusters
VCARD.</t>

</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

<t>This document requests IANA to add the .geo extention to the RPKI file extension namespace.</t>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>The RPKI object described here is used in a descriptive nature and provide information that is useful in
the analysis of routing systems. As such, the authors believes that it does not 
constitute an additional security risk. It is recommended that the issuers of the GEO-RPKI objects consider their
own privacy concerns before supplying geographical coordinates in the RPKI.
