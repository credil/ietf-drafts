		   <t> This document describes the architecture of OMA mobile email (MEM) using Internet Mail protocols
			   defined by the IETF.  Many of these protocols have been enhanced by the LEMONADE
			   work group for use in the mobile environment and are summarized in the 
		   	<xref target="refs.profile">LEMONADE profile </xref> and its revision  <xref target="refs.profilebis">LEMONADE profile bis </xref>.  This document shows

    			the requirements and architecture of mobile email.  IETF LEMONADE has been
    			liaising with them and have based much of our Internet Mail enhancements based
    			on their input.  This section summarizes the output of the OMA.</t>
    		
    		<section title="OMA MEM Requirements">
				  <t>The OMA MEM activity has collected a set of use cases and derived requirements for a mobile email enabler (MEM).

				  some involve other OMA technologies outside the scope of IETF and some relate to implementations and

    		It identifies the following elements:</t>
    		<list style="symbols">
    		<t> The MEM client which implements the client-side functionality of the OMA Mobile Email Enabler. 
    		It is also responsible for providing the mobile email user experience and interface to the user and 
    		storing the email and data to be sent to the MEM server when not connected.</t>
    		<t>The MEM server which implements the server-side functionality of the OMA Mobile Email Enabler (MEM).</t>  
    		<t>The MEM protocol between the MEM Client and MEM Server. It is responsible for all the inband data exchanges 
    		 that take place between the MEM client and server in order to 
    		update the MEM client with email server changes, the email server with changes in the MEM client and 
    		to send new email from the email server. </t>
    		<t>Other OMA enablers are needed to directly support the mobile email enabler. They are out of scope of IETF but they may 
    		include support for:</t>
    		<list style="symbols">
    		<t> Client provisioning and management for over the air installation of the MEM client on the device, 
    		provisioning of its settings and revocation</t>
    		<t>Messaging enablers for outband notification, where outband notifications that are server to client event 
    			exchanges not transported by the MEM protocol but via other channels. </t>
    		</list>
    		</list>
            	
			<t> OMA identifies different interfaces:</t>
			<list style="symbols">
			<t>ME-1: MEM client interface to interact via the MEM protocol with the MEM server</t>
			<t>ME-2: Corresponding interface of the MEM server</t>
			<t>ME-3: Outband MEM server interfaces (e.g. to support generation of server to client notifications).</t>
			<t>ME-4: Outband MEM client interfaces (e.g. to receive server to client notifications).</t>
			<t>ME-5: Interface for management of MEM enabler server settings, user preferences and filters (globally and per account)</t>
			</list>
			
			<t>The MEM server enables an email server. In a particular implementation, 
			the email server may be packaged with (internal to it) the MEM server or be in a separate component. 
			In such cases, interfaces to the email server are out of scope of the OMA MEM specifications. In the present document, we 
			focus on the case where the backend consists of IETF IMAP and Submit servers. However, relationship
			to other cases are also discussed. The I2 interface is an OMA notation to designate protocol / interfaces that are not 
			specified by the MEM enabler but may be standardized elsewhere.</t>

			<t>OMA MEM identifies that each component (MEM client, MEM servers, Other enablers and email server) may be deployed

    				provisioning and device management.  Other provisioning
    				specifications are available (e.g.  SMS based).</t>

			<t>As described in <xref target="IETF LEMONADE Architecture"/>, the LEMONADE profile assumes LEMONADE profile compliant 
			IMAP stores and Submit servers. Because the LEMONADE profile extends the IMAP store and the submit server, the 
			mobile enablement of email provided by the LEMONADE profile is directly provided in these server. Mapped to OMA MEM logical 
			architecture, for the case considered and specified by the LEMONADE profile, the MEM server and email server logically combined. 
			They are however split into distinct LEMONADE message store and LEMONADE submit server. ME-2 consists of two 
			interfaces ME-2a and ME-2b associated respectively to IMAP extended according to the LEMONADE profile and SUBMIT extended 
			according to the LEMONADE profile.

    		According to these analyses, there is a need to support:
    		#    Mechanisms for event-based (server to client) synchronization:
    		*       Defines the relationship between notification mechanisms and
    		the IMAP4 protocol
    		-          To minimize the latency observed for email events on the
    		email server to be reflected in the email client.
    		-         To avoid unnecessary polling and requests from the e-mail
    		clients:
    		.             To reduce the total amount of data to be exchanged
    		between email server and client, e.g. by allowing the email client
    		to select which messages to synchronize and how to synchronize.
    		.            To reduce the amount of transactions.
    		*       Needs to cope with possible lost or delayed notifications
    		*      Support in-band (within IMAP band) and out-band notifications
    		(Exchanged via other servers / enablers).
    		-          Specified in ways that are network transport independent
    		but may contain some bindings to particular notification channels
    		(e.g.  SMS binary, WAP Push, SIP Notification, ...)
    		-         When the email client is connected to the email server,
        		only inband notifications is expected take place
    		*       Defines notification payload for inband and outband
    		mechanisms.
    		#    Server-side filtering to decide which messages will be
    		accessible by the email client.
    		*       Filtering results into the following logical types:
    		-          Type A:  Messages filtered out and not accessible by the
    		email client (no notification, no header access, no access)
    		-         Type B:  Messages that are accessible by the mobile e-mail
    		enabler client but no outband notification takes place.
    		Inband notification might however take place if email
    		client is already connected to email server.
    		-         Type C:  Messages that are accessible by the e-mail client
    		for which notifications (outband or inband) are always
    		sent to the email client.
    		#    Notions of Filters:
    		*       View filters:  Filters that determine which email messages
    		are of type B and C or A
    		*      Notification filters:  Filters that determine which email
    		messages are of type C or B
    		*      Event filters:  Filters that determines what events are to be
    		notified to the client
    		#    Mechanisms to allow the user to update the filters from the
    		email client
    		#   Mechanisms to allow configuration and exchange of settings
