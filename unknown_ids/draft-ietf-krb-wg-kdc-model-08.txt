              An information model for Kerberos version 5
                     draft-ietf-krb-wg-kdc-model-08

Abstract

   This document describes an information model for Kerberos version 5
   from the point of view of an administrative service.  There is no
   standard for administrating a kerberos 5 KDC.  This document
   describes the services exposed by an administrative interface to a
   KDC.

2.  Introduction

   The Kerberos version 5 authentication service described in [RFC4120]
   describes how a Key Distribution Service (KDC) provides
   authentication to clients.  The standard does not stipulate how a KDC
   is managed and several "kadmin" servers have evolved.  This document
   describes the services required to administer a KDC and the
   underlying information model assumed by a kadmin-type service.

   The information model is written in terms of "attributes" and
   "services" or "interfaces" but the use of these particular words MUST
   NOT be taken to imply any particular modeling paradigm.  Neither an
   object oriented model nor an LDAP schema is intended.  The author has
   attempted to describe in natural language the intended semantics and
   syntax of the components of the model.  An LDAP schema (for instance)
   based on this model will be more precise in the expression of the
   syntax while preserving the semantics of this model.

   Implementations of this document MAY decide to change the names used
   (e.g. principalName).  If so an implementation MUST provide a name to
   name mapping to this document.

3.  How to interpret RFC2119 terms

   This document describes an information model for kerberos 5 but does
   not directly describe any mapping onto a particular schema- or
   modelling language.  Hence an implementation of this model consists
   of a mapping to such a language - e.g. an LDAP or SQL schema.  The
   precise interpretation of terms from [RFC2119] therefore require some
   extra explanation.  The terms MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL
   NOT mean that an implementation MUST provide a feature but does not
   mean that this feature MUST be REQUIRED by the implementation - e.g.
   an attribute is available in an LDAP schema but marked as OPTIONAL.
   If a feature must be implemented and REQUIRED this is made explicit
   in this model.  The term MAY, OPTIONAL and RECOMMENDED means that an
   implementation MAY need to REQUIRE the feature due to the particular
   nature of the schema/modelling language.  In some cases this is
   expressly forbidden by this model (feature X MUST NOT be REQUIRED by
   an implementation).

   Any implementation of this model SHOULD be published as an RFC.

5.  Information model demarcation

   The information model specified in the next chapter describes
   objects, properties of those objects and relations between those
   objects.  These elements comprise an abstract view of the data
   represented in a KDC.  It is important to understand that the
   information model is not a schema.  In particular the way objects are
   compared for equality beyond that which is implied by the
   specification of a syntax is not part of this specification.  Nor is
   ordering specified between elements of a particular syntax.

   Further work on Kerberos will undoubtedly prompt updates to this
   information model to reflect changes in the functions performed by
   the KDC.  Such extensions to the information model MUST always use a
   normative reference to the relevant RFCs detailing the change in KDC
   function.

   This model describes a number of elements related to password policy
   management.  Not all of the elements in this model are unique to
   Kerberos; an LDAP implementation of this model should incorporate
   existing LDAP schema where functional overlap exists, rather than
   defining additional Kerberos-specific elements.

6.  Information model specification

6.1.  Principal

   The fundamental entity stored in a KDC is the principal.  The
   principal is associated to keys and generalizes the "user" concept.
   The principal MUST be implemented in full and MUST NOT be optional in
   an implementation

6.1.1.  Principal: Attributes

6.1.1.1.  principalName

   The principalName MUST uniquely identify the principal within the
   administrative context of the KDC.  The principalName MUST be
   equivalent to the string representation of the principal name
   including, if applicable for the name type, the realm.

   The attribute MAY be multi-valued if the implementation supports
   aliases and/or enterprise names.  In that case exactly one of the
   principalName values MAY be designated the canonical principalName
   and if the implementation supports enctypes which require salt then
   exactly one of the values of principalName MAY be designated as the
   canonical salting principalName.

   Implementations (i.e. schema) that support enterprise names and/or
   aliases SHOULD provide for efficient lookup of principal objects
   based on alias/enterprise name.

6.1.1.2.  principalNotUsedBefore

   The principal may not be used before this date.  The syntax of the
   attribute MUST be semantically equivalent with the standard ISO date
   format.  The attribute MUST be single-valued.

6.1.1.3.  principalNotUsedAfter

   The principal may not be used after this date.  The syntax of the
   attribute MUST be semantically equivalent with the standard ISO date
   format.  The attribute MUST be single-valued.

6.1.1.4.  principalIsDisabled

   A boolean attribute used to disable a principal.  The attribute
   SHOULD default to false.

Internet-Draft            KDC Information Model                 May 2010


6.1.1.5.  principalNumberOfFailedAuthenticationAttempts

   This single-valued integer attribute contains a count of the number
   of times an authentication attempt was unsuccessful for this
   principal.  Implementations SHOULD NOT allow this counter to be
   reset.

6.1.1.6.  principalLastFailedAuthentication

   This single-valued attribute contains the time and date for the last
   failed authentication attempt for this principal.

6.1.1.7.  principalLastSuccessfulAuthentication

   This single-valued attribute contains the time and date for the last
   successful authentication attempt for this principal.

6.1.1.8.  principalLastCredentialChangeTime

   This single-valued attribute contains the time and date for the last
   successful change of credential (e.g. password or private key)
   associated with this principal.

6.1.1.9.  principalCreateTime

   This single-valued attribute contains the time and date when this
   principal was created

6.1.1.10.  principalModifyTime

   This single-valued attribute contains the time and date when this
   principal was modified excluding credentials change.

6.1.1.11.  principalMaximumTicketLifetime

   This single-valued attribute contains the delta time in seconds
   representing the maximum lifetime for tickets issued for this
   principal.

6.1.1.12.  principalMaximumRenewableTicketLifetime

   This single-valued attribute contains the delta time in seconds
   representing the maximum amount of time a ticket may be renewed for.

6.1.1.13.  principalAllowedEnctype

   This OPTIONAL multi-valued attribute lists the enctypes allowed for
   this principal.  If empty or absent any enctype supported by the

Internet-Draft            KDC Information Model                 May 2010


   implementation is allowed for this principal.

   This attribute is intended as a policy attribute and restricts all
   uses of enctypes including server, client, and session keys.  Data
   models MAY choose to use policy objects in order to represent more
   complex decision mechanisms.

6.1.2.  Principal: Associations

   Each principal MAY be associated with 0 or more KeySet and MAY be
   associated with 0 or more Policies.  The KeySet is represented as an
   object in this model since it has attributes associated with it (the
   key version number).  In typical situations the principal is
   associated with exactly 1 KeySet but implementations MUST NOT assume
   this case, i.e. an implementation of this standard MUST be able to
   handle the general case of multiple KeySet associated with each
   principal.  Multiple KeySets may for instance be useful when
   performing a key rollover for a principal.

6.2.  KeySet

   A KeySet is a set of keys associated with exactly one principal.
   This object and its associations MUST NOT be REQUIRED by a data-
   model.  It is expected that most Kerberos implementations will use
   the set/change password protocol for all aspects of key management
   [I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-set-passwd].  This information model only
   includes these objects for the sake of completeness.

   If a server supports an enctype for a principal that enctype must be
   present in at least one key for the principal in question.

6.2.1.  KeySet: Attributes

6.2.1.1.  keySetVersionNumber

   This is traditionally called the key version number (kvno).  This is
   a single-valued attribute containing a positive integer.

6.2.2.  KeySet: Associations

   To each KeySet MUST be associated a set of 1 or more Keys.

6.2.3.  KeySet: Remarks

   The security of Kerberos 5 depends absolutely on the confidentiality
   and integrity of the keys stored in the KDC.  Implementations of this
   standard MUST facilitate, to the extent possible, an administrator's
   ability to place more restrictive access controls on KeySets than on

   other principal data, and to arrange for more secure backup for
   KeySets.

6.3.  Key

   Implementations of this model MUST NOT REQUIRE keys to be
   represented.

6.3.1.  Key: Attributes

6.3.1.1.  keyEncryptionType

   The enctype SHOULD be represented as an enumeration of the enctypes
   supported by the KDC using the string name of the enctype from
   [RFC3961]

6.3.1.2.  keyValue

   The binary representation of the key data.  This MUST be a single-
   valued octet string.

6.3.1.3.  keySaltValue

   The binary representation of the key salt.  This MUST be a single-
   valued octet string.

6.3.1.4.  keyStringToKeyParameter

   This MUST be a single-valued octet string representing an opaque
   parameter associated with the enctype.

6.3.1.5.  keyNotUsedBefore

   This key MUST NOT be used before this date.  The syntax of the
   attribute MUST be semantically equivalent with the standard ISO date
   format.  This MUST be a single-valued attribute.

6.3.1.6.  keyNotUsedAfter

   This key MUST NOT be used after this date.  The syntax of the
   attribute MUST be semantically equivalent with the standard ISO date
   format.  This MUST be a single-valued attribute.

6.3.1.7.  keyNotUsedBefore

   This key MUST NOT be used before this date.  The syntax of the
   attribute MUST be semantically equivalent with the standard ISO date
   format.  This MUST be a single-valued attribute.

Internet-Draft            KDC Information Model                 May 2010


6.3.1.8.  keyIsDisabled

   This is a boolean attribute which SHOULD be set to false by default.
   If this attribute is true the key MUST NOT be used.  This is used to
   temporarily disable a key.

6.3.2.  Key: Associations

   None

6.3.3.  Key: Remarks

   The security of the keys is an absolute requirement for the operation
   of Kerberos 5.  If keys are implemented adequate protection from
   unauthorized modification and disclosure MUST be available and
   REQUIRED by the implementation.

6.4.  Policy

   Implementations SHOULD implement policy but MAY allow them to be
   OPTIONAL.  The Policy should be thought of as a 'typed hole'. i.e. an
   opaque binary value paired with an identifier of type of data
   contained in the binary value.  Both attributes (type and value) must
   be present.

6.4.1.  Policy: Attributes

6.4.1.1.  policyIdentifier

   The policyIdentifier MUST be unique within the local administrative
   context and MUST be globally unique.  Possible types of identifiers
   include:

      An Object Identifier (OID)

      A URI

      A UUID

   The use of OIDs is RECOMMENDED for this purpose.

6.4.1.2.  policyIsCritical

   This boolean attribute indicates that the KDC MUST be able to
   correctly interpret and apply this policy for the key to be used.

Internet-Draft            KDC Information Model                 May 2010


6.4.1.3.  policyContent

   This is an optional single opaque binary value used to store a
   representation of the policy.  In general a policy cannot be fully
   expressed using attribute-value pairs.  The policyContent is OPTIONAL
   in the sense that an implementation MAY use it to store an opaque
   value for those policy-types which are not directly representable in
   that implementation.

6.4.1.4.  policyUse

   This is an optional single enumerated string value used to describe
   the use of the policy.  Implementations SHOULD provide this attribute
   and MUST (if the attribute is implemented) describe the enumerated
   set of possible values.  The intent is that this attribute be useful
   in providing an initial context-based filtering.

6.4.2.  Mandatory-to-implement Policy

   All implementations MUST be able to represent the policies listed in
   this section.  Implementations are not required to use the same
   underlying data-representation for the policyContent binary value but
   SHOULD use the same OIDs as the policyIdentifier.  In general the
   expression of policy may require a Turing-complete language.  This
   specification does not attempt to model policy expression language.

6.4.2.1.  Password Quality Policy

   Password quality policy controls the requirements placed by the KDC
   on new passwords.  This policy SHOULD be identified by the OID
   <TBD>.1.

6.4.2.2.  Password Management Policy

   Password management policy controls how passwords are changed.  This
   policy SHOULD be identified by the OID <TBD>.2.

6.4.2.3.  Keying Policy

   A keying policy specifies the association of enctypes with new
   principals, e.g. when a principal is created one of the applicable
   keying policies is used to determine the set of keys to associate
   with the principal.  This policy SHOULD be identified by the OID
   <TBD>.3.

   issued for a principal.  This policy SHOULD be identified by the OID
   <TBD>.4.

7.  Implementation Scenarios

   There are several ways to implement an administrative service for
   Kerberos 5 based on this information model.  In this section we list
   a few of them.

7.1.  LDAP backend to KDC

   Given an LDAP schema implementation of this information model it
   would be possible to build an administrative service by back-ending
   the KDC to a directory server where principals and keys are stored.
   Using the security mechanisms available on the directory server keys
   are protected from access by anyone apart from the KDC.
   Administration of the principals, policy, and other non-key data is
   done through the directory server while the keys are modified using
   the set/change password protocol
   [I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-set-passwd].

7.2.  LDAP frontend to KDC

   An alternative way to provide a directory interface to the KDC is to
   implement an LDAP-frontend to the KDC which exposes all non-key
   objects as entries and attributes.  As in the example above all keys
   are modified using the set/change password protocol
   [I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-set-passwd].  In this scenario the
   implementation would typically not use a traditional LDAP
   implementation but treat LDAP as an access protocol to data in the
   native KDC database.

7.3.  SOAP

   Given an XML schema implementation of this information model it would
   be possible to build a SOAP interface to the KDC.  This demonstrates
   the value of creating an abstract information model which is mappable
   to multiple schema representations.

7.4.  Netconf

   Given a YAML implementation of this information model it would be
   possible to create a Netconf-based interface to the KDC, enabling
   management of the KDC from standard network management applications.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes an abstract information model for Kerberos 5.
   The Kerberos 5 protocol depends on the security of the keys stored in
   the KDC.  The model described here assumes that keys MUST NOT be
   transported in the clear over the network and furthermore that keys
   are treated as write-only attributes that SHALL only be modified
   (using the administrative interface) by the change-password protocol
   [I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-set-passwd].

   Exposing the object model of a KDC typically implies that objects can
   be modified and/or deleted.  In a KDC not all principals are created
   equal, so that for instance deleting krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM
   effectively disables the EXAMPLE.COM realm.  Hence access control is
   paramount to the security of any implementation.  This document does
   not mandate access control.  This only implies that access control is
   beyond the scope of the standard information model, i.e. that access
   control may not be accessible via any protocol based on this model.
   If access control objects are exposed via an extension to this model
   the presence of access control may in itself provide points of attack
   by giving away information about principals with elevated rights etc.
