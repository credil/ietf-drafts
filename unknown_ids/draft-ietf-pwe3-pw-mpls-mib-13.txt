Internet-Draft                 PW MPLS MIB                 November 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a model for managing pseudowire services for
   transmission over different flavors of MPLS tunnels.  The general PW
   MIB module [PWMIB] defines the parameters global to the PW regardless
   of underlying PSN and emulated service.  Indicating the MPLS PSN type
   in PW-STD-MIB references this module.

   This document describes the MIB objects that define pseudowire
   association to the MPLS PSN, in a way that is not specific to the
   carried service.

   Together, [RFC3811] and [RFC3812], describe the modeling of an MPLS
   Tunnel, and a Tunnel's underlying cross-connects.  This MIB module
   supports MPLS-TE PSN, Non-TE MPLS PSN (an outer tunnel created by LDP
   or manually), and MPLS PW label only (no outer tunnel).

   Comments should be made directly to the PWE3 mailing list at
   pwe3@ietf.org.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the PW
   architecture [RFC3985], [RFC3916] and [RFC4447].

   The terms "Outbound" and "Inbound" in this MIB module are based on
   the common practice in the MPLS standards, i.e. "outbound" is toward
   the PSN.  However, where these terms are used in an object name, the
   object description clarifies the exact packet direction to prevent
   confusion with these terms in other documents.

   "PSN Tunnel" is a general term indicating a virtual connection
   between the two PWE3 edge devices.  Each tunnel may potentially carry
   multiple PWs inside.  In the scope of this document, it is an MPLS
   tunnel.

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the MPLS
   architecture [RFC3031] for MPLS PSN.  A Label Switched Path (LSP) is
   modeled as described in [RFC3811] and [RFC3812] via a series of
   cross-connects through one or more Label Switch Routers (LSR).

   In MPLS PSN, a PW connection typically uses a PW Label within a
   Tunnel Label [RFC4447].  Multiple pseudowires each with a unique PW
   Label can share the same Tunnel.  For PW transport over MPLS, the
   Tunnel Label is known as the "outer" Label, while the PW Label is
   known as the "inner" Label.  An exception to this is with adjacent
   LSRs or the use of PHP.  In this case, there is an option for PWs to
   connect directly without an outer Label.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [BCP14].


4.  Overview

   The MIB module structure for defining a PW service consists of three
   layers of MIB modules functioning together.  This general model is
   defined in the PWE3 architecture [RFC3985].  The layering model is
   intended to sufficiently isolate PW services from the underlying PSN
   layer that carries the emulated service.  This is done at the same
   time as providing a standard means for connecting any supported
   services to any supported PSNs.

   The first layer, known as the service layer, contains service-
   specific modules.  These modules define service-specific management
   objects that interface or collaborate with existing MIB modules for
   the native version of the service.  The service-specific module
   "glues" the standard modules to the PWE3 MIB modules.

   The next layer of the PWE3 MIB structure is the PW MIB module
   [PWMIB].  This module is used to configure general parameters of PWs
   that are common to all types of emulated services and PSNs.  This
   layer is connected to the service-specific layer above, and the PSN
   layer below.

   The PSN layer provides PSN-specific modules for each type of PSN.
   These modules associate the PW with one or more "tunnels" that carry
   the service over the PSN.  These modules are used to "glue" the PW

   service to the underlying PSN-specific MIB modules.  This document
   defines the MIB module for PW over MPLS PSN.

   [PWTC] defines some of the object types used in these modules.


5.  Features Checklist

   The PW-MPLS-STD-MIB module is designed to satisfy the following
   requirements and constraints:

   -  The MIB module supports both manually configured and signaled PWs.

   -  The MIB module supports point-to-point PW connections.

   -  The MIB module enables the use of any emulated service.

   -  The MIB module supports MPLS-TE outer tunnel, Non-TE MPLS outer
      tunnel (an outer tunnel signaled by LDP or set-up manually), and
      no outer tunnel (where the PW label is the only label in the MPLS
      stack).  The later case is applicable for manual configuration of
      PW over a single hop, as for signaled MPLS PSN even across a
      single hop there is an MPLS tunnel - even though the actual packet
      may not contain the MPLS tunnel label due to PHP.

   The MIB module uses TCs from [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC2580],
   [RFC2863], [RFC3811], [RFC3813], [PWTC] and [PWMIB].


6.  MIB Module Usage

   -  The PW table (pwTable) in [PWMIB] is used for all PW types (ATM,
      FR, Ethernet, SONET, etc.).  This table contains high level
      generic parameters related to the PW creation.  The operator or
      the agent creates a row for each PW.

   -  If the selected PSN type in pwTable is MPLS, the agent creates a
      row in the MPLS specific parameters table (pwMplsTable) in this
      module, which contains MPLS specific parameters such as EXP bits
      handling and outer tunnel configuration.

   -  The operator configures the association to the desired MPLS tunnel
      (require for MPLS-TE tunnels or for manually configured PWs)
      through the pwMplsTeOutbaoundTable.  For LDP based outer tunnel,
      there is no need for manual configuration since there is only a
      single tunnel toward the peer.

   -  The agent creates rows in the MPLS mapping table in order to allow
      quick retrieval of information based on the tunnel indexes.

   The relation to the MPLS network is by configuration of the edge LSR
   only - i.e. the LSR which provides the PW function.  Since Tunnels
   are uni-directional, a pair of tunnels MUST exist (one for inbound,
   one for outbound).  Figure 1 depicts a PW that originates and
   terminates at LSR-M.  It uses tunnels A and B formed by cross-
   connects (XCs) Ax and Bx continuing through LSR-N to LSR-P.  The
   concatenations of XCs create the tunnels.  Note: 'X' denotes a
   tunnel's cross-connect.

                      Figure 1: PW modeling over MPLS

   The PW-MPLS-STD-MIB supports three options for MPLS network:

   (1)  In the MPLS-TE case, tunnels A and B are created via the MPLS-
        TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812].  The tunnels are associated (in each peer
        independently) to the PW by the four indexes that uniquely
        identify the tunnel at the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB.

   (2)  In the Non-TE case, tunnels A1 and B1 are either manually
        configured or set up with LDP.  The tunnels are associated to
        the PW by the XC index in the MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813].

Internet-Draft                 PW MPLS MIB                 November 2007


   (3)  In the PW label only case, there is no outer tunnel on top of
        the PW label.  This case is useful in case of adjacent PEs in
        manual configuration mode.  Note that for signaled tunnels, when
        LSR-N acts as PHP for the outer tunnel label, there are still
        entries for the outer tunnel in the relevant MPLS MIB modules,
        so even for the case of adjacent LSRs, the relevant mode is
        either MPLS-TE or non-TE.

   A combination of MPLS-TE outer tunnel(s) and LDP outer tunnel for the
   same PW is allowed through the pwMplsOutboundTunnel.  The current
   tunnel that is used to forward traffic is indicated in the object
   pwMplsOutboundTunnelTypeInUse.

   The PW-MPLS-STD-MIB module reports through the inbound table the XC
   entry in the LDP-STD-MIB [RFC3815] of the PW that were signaled
   through LDP.

   This MIB module assumes that a PW can be associated to one MPLS-TE
   tunnel at a time.  This tunnel may be composed of multiple instances
   (i.e.  LSP), each represented by a separate instance index.  The
   selection of the active LSP out of the possible LSPs in the tunnel is
   out of the scope of this MIB module as it is part of the MPLS PSN
   functionality.  The current active LSP is reported through this MIB
   module.

   It is important to note that inbound (tunnel originated in the remote
   PE) mapping is not configured nor reported through the PW-MPLS-STD-
   MIB module since the local PE does not know the inbound association
   between specific PW and MPLS tunnels.


7.  PW-MPLS-STD-MIB Example

   The following example (supplement the example provided in [PWMIB])
   assumes that the node has already established LDP tunnel to the peer
   node and that a PW has been configured in the pwTbale in [PWMIB] with
   pwPsnType equal 'mpls'.

   The agent creates an entry in pwMplsTable with the following
   parameters:

         pwMplsMplsType             mplsNonTe(1), -- LDP tunnel
         pwMplsExpBitsMode          outerTunnel(1), -- Default
         pwMplsExpBits              0, -- Default
         pwMplsTtl                  2, -- Default
         pwMplsLocalLdpID           192.0.2.200:0,
         pwMplsLocalLdpEntityIndex  1,
         pwMplsPeerLdpID            192.0.2.5:0,

         pwMplsStorageType          nonVolatile(3)

   The agent also creates an entry in pwMplsOutboundTable for reporting
   the mapping of the PW on the LDP tunnel:

         pwMplsOutboundLsrXcIndex           100, - The XC number for the
                                                 -- LDP Tunnel
         pwMplsOutboundTunnelIndex          0, -- No TE tunnel
         pwMplsOutboundTunnelInstance       0, -- No TE tunnel
         pwMplsOutboundTunnelLclLSR         0, -- No TE tunnel
         pwMplsOutboundTunnelPeerLSR        0, -- No TE tunnel
         pwMplsOutboundIfIndex              0, -- Not applicable
         pwMplsOutboundTunnelTypeInUse      mplsNonTe(3)

   The agent now creates entries for the PW in the following tables:

   -  pwMplsInboundTable

   -  pwMplsNonTeMappingTable (2 entries)

   To create an MPLS-TE tunnel to carry this PW, the operator make the
   following steps:

   -  Set pwMplsMplsType in pwMplsTable to both mplsNonTe(1) and
      mplsTe(0).

   -  Set pwMplsOutboundTunnelIndex, pwMplsOutboundTunnelInstance,
      pwMplsOutboundTunnelLclLSR and pwMplsOutboundTunnelPeerLSR in
      pwMplsOutboundTable to the MPLS-TE tunnel that will carry this PW.

   The agent will report the tunnel which the PW is currently using
   through pwMplsOutboundTunnelTypeInUse, and will report the PW to
   MPLS-TE tunnel/LSP mapping in pwMplsTeMappingTable.

          "A row in this table configures the outer tunnel used for
           carrying the PW traffic toward the PSN.
           In the case of PW labels only, it configures the interface
           that will carry the PW traffic.

           An entry in this table augments the pwMplsEntry, and is
           created automatically when the corresponding row has been
           created by the agent in the pwMplsEntry.

           This table points to the appropriate MPLS MIB module:

           In the MPLS-TE case, the three objects relevant to the
           indexing of a TE tunnel head-end (as used in the
           MPLS-TE-STD-MIB) are to be configured, and the tunnel
           instance indicates the LSP that is currently in use for
           forwarding the traffic.

           In case of signaled Non-TE MPLS (an outer tunnel label
           assigned by LDP) the table points to the XC entry in the
           LSR-STD-MIB. If the Non-TE MPLS tunnel is manually
           configured, the operator configures the XC pointer to this
           tunnel.

           In case of PW label only (no outer tunnel) the ifIndex of
           the port to carry the PW is configured here.

           It is possible to associate a PW to one TE tunnel head-end
           and a non-TE tunnel together. An indication in this table
           will report the currently active one. In addition, in the
           TE case the table reports the active tunnel instance
           (i.e. the specific LSP in use).
           Any read-write object in this table MAY be changed at any
           time, however change of some objects (for example
           MPLS-TE indexes) during PW forwarding state MAY cause traffic
           disruption."

9.  Security Considerations

   It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for monitoring
   PW-capable PEs.  This MIB module can also be used for configuration
   of certain objects, and anything that can be configured can be
   incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous results.

   There are number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on



Zelig & Nadeau            Expires May 21, 2008                 [Page 27]

Internet-Draft                 PW MPLS MIB                 November 2007


   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the pwMplsTable, pwMplsNonTeMappingTable and pwMplsTeMappingTable
      collectively contain objects to provision PW over MPLS tunnels.
      Unauthorized access to objects in these tables, could result in
      disruption of traffic on the network.  The use of stronger
      mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be considered where
      possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used with any
      v3 agent which implements this MIB module.  Administrators should
      consider whether read access to these objects should be allowed,
      since read access may be undesirable under certain circumstances.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the pwMplsTable, pwMplsNonTeMappingTable, pwMplsTeMappingTable and
      pwMplsOutboundTable collectively show the PW over MPLS
      association.  If an Administrator does not want to reveal this
      information, then these tables should be considered sensitive/
      vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------

         pwMplsStdMIB       { transmission XXX }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): The IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'transmission'
   subtree and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.
   When the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace
   "XXX" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to
   remove this note.
