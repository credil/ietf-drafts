    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t>Route-reflection<xref target="RFC4456"/> is commonly used to enhance
         the scalability of iBGP, by reducing full-meshing requirements. 
         It is well-known that its use can introduce convergence problems, 
         particularly oscillations.
         Even with coherent intra-AS policy and IGP configuration such 
         problems can occur due to the effect of the 
         MED attribute<xref target="RFC3345"/>.
      </t>
      <t>This document follows from the work of
         <xref target="Flavel, Roughan"/> which shows iBGP oscillations
         can be solved by a
         slight modification to the iBGP route selection process,
         and provably
         so by the application of the routing
         algebra of <xref target="Sobrinho"/>. Indeed, where iBGP follows
         the underlying topology, (that is, iBGP sessions never transit through
         other iBGP routers) with this modification iBGP provably converges
         on optimal routes.
      </t><t>
         <xref target="RFC4456"/> introduces a CLUSTER_LIST attribute, 
         to record which route-reflectors a route passes through. 
         Further, <xref target="RFC4456"/> modifies the route decision process 
         described in <xref target="RFC4271"/> to consider the
         CLUSTER_LIST length in between steps f) and g). 
      </t><t>
         The suggested solution
         is to instead insert the CLUSTER_LIST tie-break step in 
         between b) and c) of <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
         That is, the iBGP hop-count - which CLUSTER_LIST reflects - is
         used to select between routes before considering MEDs. 
         This ensures that routes are ordered such that iBGP will converge,
         rather than oscillate.
      </t><t>
         The semantics of the MED obviously then are weakened as it
         now can be overridden by details of the iBGP topology.
         As a consequence different
         speakers within an AS may select different routes to a neighbouring AS,
         where normal <xref target="RFC4271"/> speakers would select the same
         route based on MED values. This is perhaps a small price to pay for
         having a convergent iBGP, and the preferable outcome for most. Further,
         RR hierarchies can already cause MEDs to be ignored in such a way.
      </t><t>
         In practical terms, this means MED can no longer can be used where
         ASes wish to distinguish between primary and solely secondary,
         backup links with a neighbour, such that the backup link should
         normally never be used. Instead, some other mechanism must be used,
         such as community-based preference adjustments.
      </t><t>
         This proposal would also affect any cases where MEDs are set on
         ingress as an intra-AS metric for routes with equal AS_PATH lengths #
         to steer traffic to preferred egress points.
         Such scenarios would imply always
         comparing MED values, regardless of which neighbouring AS a route
         was received from. In such cases, presuming MED values are never reset
         when routes are propagated, it is safe to instead put the CLUSTER_LIST
         length check after the MED check. Safer still
         would be to define a specific attribute to carry an
         interior egress preference metric, to be evaluated after the 
         AS_PATH length and defined to be monotonic.

    <section title="Modifications to BGP Route Reflection" anchor="mods">
      <t>
         Section 9 of <xref target="RFC4456"/> describes a new step to be
         added to the <xref target="RFC4271"/> route decision process as follows:
         <list><t>
         a BGP Speaker SHOULD prefer a route with the shorter
         CLUSTER_LIST length.  The CLUSTER_LIST length is zero if a route
         does not carry the CLUSTER_LIST attribute.
         </t></list>
      </t><t>
         <xref target="RFC4456"/> is modified such that the step above
         is instead inserted between steps b and c of <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
      </t><t>
         Implementations SHOULD provide a means to allow the operator to 
         configure whether to use this behaviour,
         or that of <xref target="RFC4456"/>.
