Abstract 

   Applications routinely open multiple TCP connections.  For example, 
   P2P applications maintain connections to a number of different peers 
   while web browsers perform concurrent download from the same web 
   server.  Application designers pursue different goals when doing so:

   P2P apps need to maintain a well-connected mesh in the swarm while 
   web browsers mainly use multiple connections to parallelize requests 
   that involve application latency on the web server side.  But this 
   practice also has impacts to the host and the network as a whole. For 
   example, an application can obtain a larger fraction of the 
   bottleneck than if it had used fewer connections. Although capacity 
   is the most commonly considered bottleneck resource, middlebox state 
   table entries are also an important resource for an end system 
   communication.  

   This documents clarifies the current practices of application design 
   and reasons behind them, and discusses the tradeoffs surrounding the 
   use of many concurrent TCP connections to one destination and/or to 
   different destinations. Other resource types may exist, and the 
   guidelines are expected to comprehensively discuss them.

1. Introduction 

   The use of P2P protocols by end users is widespread. These protocols 
   are meant to exchange, replicate, stream or download files with

   little human intervention, trying at the same time to minimize the 
   download time of the files requested by any single peer. This is done 
   by opening several connections to multiple peers and downloading one 
   or more chunks of the file from each one, selecting faster peers, 
   amongst others.  

   Now end users that utilize P2P clients in general not only consume 
   more bandwidth but consume bandwidth throughout the whole day, and 
   more specifically consume more upstream bandwidth since they share 
   files, and more downstream bandwidth since P2P clients try to 
   minimize download time.  

   The advantages of P2P applications come from the fact that they open 
   multiple TCP connection to different peers. On the other hand, this 
   is also their major drawback. 

   But the use of multiple TCP connections by an application is not new. 
   Web Browsers have being it for a decade. But these are usually short-
   lived connections to a single host as opposed to long-lived P2P 
   connections.  

   With the popularity of P2P applications, which maintain hundreds of 
   long-lived TCP connections to multiple hosts, the issue applications 
   making use of multiple TCP connections has been gaining attention. 

   This documents clarifies the current practices of application design 
   and reasons behind them, and discusses the tradeoffs surrounding the 
   use of many concurrent TCP connections to one destination and/or to 
   different destinations. Other resource types may exist, and the 
   guidelines are expected to comprehensively discuss them.  

2. Multiple TCP Connections Advantages 

   There are good reasons for an application to use multiple TCP 
   connections. P2P apps need to maintain a well-connected mesh in the 
   swarm while web browsers mainly use multiple connections to 
   parallelize requests that involve application latency on the web 
   server side 

   But from a P2P standpoint multiple TCP connections are at the heart 
   of its functionality. Multiple connections allow for multiple 
   simultaneous downloads, which improve reliability and speed. Multiple 
   connections also allow more effective discovery of new peers, and 
   effective peer-to-peer communication, which allows exchange of 
   information such as which pieces of a file a client has and is 
   available.

3. Multiple TCP connections Resources 

   Every connected application on the Internet competes for resources. 
   This is not specific to applications that open multiple TCP 
   connections.  The use of multiple TCP connections just amplifies the 
   issue. In the following sections we discuss these resources and how 
   they are amplified by an application opening multiple connections.  

4. Memory Space 

   Each TCP connection needs a TCP control block (TCB) or equivalent to 
   keep state about its connection. In operating systems where the TCP 
   stack is part of the kernel, this would come from the kernel memory 
   space, otherwise from userland memory. 

   But irrespective from where the memory comes from a TCP control block 
   requires a significant amount of memory. This is significant issue 
   for devices that terminate TCP connections from multiple end hosts to 
   provide functions such as Load-Balancing, Gateway and Tunneling.  

   Some proposals have been put forward to reduce the amount of memory 
   occupied by each TCP control block [RFC2140], but the issue remains 
   significant and is amplified by applications that use multiple TCP 
   connections. 

5. Link Bandwidth 

   The bottlenecks for these n connections could be shared or separate. 
   If separate, there's no specific bottleneck where the connections are 
   hogging bandwidth. But from a network resource point of view, the 
   application download still gets multiple shares.  

   If some/all bottlenecks are shared, then two possibilities exist for 
   shared bottleneck 

   - bottleneck is a last-hop link (user traffic dominates link), OR 

   - bottleneck is in-network wide-area link (background traffic 
   dominates link) 

   If bottleneck is last-hop, then n transport connections compete with 
   each other and share link bandwidth. 

   Although these connections might impact delay-sensitive traffic and 
   increase delay, in the last hop it only affects end end-user, which 
   is in control of which applications run on its host. In this case the 
   user has the option of manually choosing when to run such

   application, configuring the end host, amongst others. Alternatively, 
   or in conjunction with the above, the application can be enhanced to 
   use Diffserv and new delay sensitive congestion mechanisms. 

   If shared bottleneck is in-network, then application gets unfair 
   share of bottleneck bandwidth. This impacts flows belonging to other 
   users in general, and most importantly delay-sensitive traffic. 

6. Middleboxes 

   Middleboxes re defined as any intermediary box performing functions 
   apart from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the data 
   path between a source host and destination host [RFC3234]. 
   Middleboxes can be stand-alone or integrated in another device such 
   as a router or modem.  

   The functions that are relevant to this discussion are those that 
   require the middlebox to keep per session state, sometimes referred 
   as transformation services. Some of these functions are, for example, 
   NAT, Intrusion Detection and Load-Balancing. 

   It is easy to see that the more sessions a host initiates, the more 
   state the middlebox will have to keep. The relationship is at least 
   1:1 but due asymmetric traffic, routing changes and others, this can 
   be 1:N. 

   Although application traffic from most broadband subscribers today go 
   through at least one middlebox (integrated into the broadband modem), 
   it can traverse other middleboxes that reside within the ISP's 
   network or close the destination. These middleboxes aggregate traffic 
   from multiple subscribers and state tables within these devices can 
   become a premium.
