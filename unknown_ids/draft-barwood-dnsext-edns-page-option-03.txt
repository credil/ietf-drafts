Internet-Draft                EDNS Page Option               August 2009


1.  Introduction

DNSSEC implies that DNS responses may be large, possibly larger than the
de facto ~1500 byte internet MTU. The IP protocol specifies a means by 
which large IP packets are split into fragments and then re-assembled.

Fragmented UDP responses are undesirable for several reasons:

(1) Fragments can easily be spoofed. The DNS ID and port number are only
present in the first fragment, and the IP ID is usually easy for an
attacker to predict.

(2) In practise fragmentation is not reliable, and large UDP packets may
fail to be delivered.

(3) If a single fragment is lost, the entire response must be re-sent.

(4) Re-assembling fragments requires buffer resources, which opens
up denial of service attacks.

Instead, it is possible to use TCP for large response, but this is 
undesirable, as TCP imposes significant overhead and state that may 
be vulnerable to denial of service attack.

Nearly all current DNS traffic is carried by UDP with a maximum size of
512 bytes, and relying on TCP is a risk for the deployment of DNSSEC.

A particular problem occurs with router proxies, which often truncate
DNS responses at 512 bytes. In this case, TCP does not help, and it is
impossible to retrieve responses through the proxy.

Therefore an EDNS option to allow large DNS responses to be sent 
using small UDP packets is proposed.

The option includes an authentication mechanism that prevents blind
spoofing of the response, provided IP fragmentation does not occur.

Internet-Draft                EDNS Page Option               August 2009

2. Protocol

  Reserved areas and undefined bits must be set to zero length / zero by
  the sender and must be ignored by the receiver.

2.1 Initial request

The client signals support in it's initial request by including
an EDNS Page option with option data :

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |0|A|   |        UDPMAX         | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   
  |             EXTID             |
  |                               |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  /           RESERVED            /
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

where :

A           is a 1 bit field set to request that the server send all
            pages immediately. It must not be used with proxy servers
            that do not support it, except for discovery. The server
            may decline the request.            

UDPMAX      is a 12 bit field that limits the UDP payload of response
            packets. Commonly set to 512, as proxies often limit
            responses to the RFC 1035 UDP limit. The minimum value
            is 512.

EXTID       is a 32 bit field used to validate the response, preventing
            blind spoofing.
   
2.2 Server response   

The server responds with an EDNS Page option with option data :

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |A|N|   |        PAGESIZE       |           TOTAL               |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |                             EXTID                             |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |                             COOKIE                            |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |     PAGE      |                                               /
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                                               /
  /                             DATA                              /
  /                                                               /
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Internet-Draft                EDNS Page Option               August 2009

A           is a 1 bit field set to indicate that all pages have
            been sent.

N           indicates that the cookie is omitted, and follow-up
            requests are not possible.

PAGESIZE    is a 14 bit field, the size of the pages into which the full
            response is divided, chosen so that the UDP payload does not
            exceed UDPMAX from the initial request. Servers may also 
            limit the UDP payload for other reasons, for example to 
            mitigate an amplification attack, or to avoid IP 
            fragmentation.

TOTAL       is the total size, in bytes, of the whole response.

EXTID       is a copy of the EXTID from the request. The client must
            check that the value is as expected.

COOKIE      is a 32 bit field, used in follow-up requests.

PAGE        is an 8 bit field.

DATA        is a variable length field containg the page data.

The client allocates an assembly buffer of TOTAL bytes, and copies DATA 
into it, at offset PAGE x PAGESIZE.

2.3 Follow-up request
  
If the A bit of the response is zero, the client sends a follow-up
request for each page it has not yet received. The client should also
send follow-up requests if an expected response is not received after
a timeout period due to packet loss.
   
A follow-up request is identical to the initial request, except 
that the EDNS page option data is as follows:

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |1|     |        PAGESIZE       | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   
  |             EXTID             |
  |                               |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |             COOKIE            |
  |                               |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |   PAGE        |               /
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+               /
  /           RESERVED            /
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

  where :

PAGESIZE    is a copy of PAGESIZE in the response.

Internet-Draft                EDNS Page Option               August 2009

EXTID       is a copy of EXTID in the initial request.

COOKIE      is a copy of COOKIE from the response.

PAGE        identifies the required page.

COOKIE      identifies a read-only representation of the full response
            on the server, possibly in conjunction with the Question.
            The cookie has a lifetime of 5 seconds. After this time
            has elapsed, a SERVERFAIL error response may be generated.
   
When the client has received all of the pages, the complete assembled
response is then processed normally.

Follow-up requests may be sent in parallel. 

3. Compatibility

Servers are not required to support the EDNS Page option, however
support is encouraged.

Authoritative servers that do not support the EDNS page option can
expect a higher level of TCP traffic.

Authoritative servers need not support cookies. Initial requests to 
authoritative servers should normally set the A flag. However, cookie
support is encouraged, as it allows dropped packets to be retried
without re-sending the whole response.

DNSSEC aware recursive servers need to support cookies if they may
be accessed via proxy servers that truncate responses at 512 bytes.

DNSSEC validating stub resolvers need to use the EDNS Page option if
they may be deployed behind proxy servers that truncate responses at
512 bytes.

Firewalls may not allow multiple responses through, and servers
should detect this possibility, and disable multiple responses,
if the firewall cannot be re-configured.


4.  Security Considerations

The secret key may expose internal state to an attacker who controls
a name server. It is essential that a cryptographically strong source
of random numbers be used to generate the secret key. This must be 
seeded from data that cannot be guessed by an attacker, such as
thermal noise or other random physical fluctuations.

Clients must verify the secret key in each response.

Fragmented responses are vulnerable to blind spoofing, therefore
fragmented responses should be avoided if possible.

Internet-Draft                EDNS Page Option               August 2009

To limit the effectiveness of amplification attacks on third parties,
servers should make every effort to limit the maximum number of
packets that are sent in response to a single query.

Suggested techniques include:

- Declining requests to send all pages when QTYPE=ANY.

- Not sending the NS RRset when QTYPE=DNSKEY.

- Limiting additional section processing so that it does not
  contribute to the maximum response.

- Checking that UDPMAX in the initial request at least 512.
