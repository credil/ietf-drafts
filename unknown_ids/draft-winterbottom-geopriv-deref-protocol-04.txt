Internet-Draft         HELD Dereferencing Protocol             July 2009


Abstract

   This document describes how to use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) over Transport Layer Security (TLS) as a dereferencing
   protocol to resolve a reference to a Presence Information Data Format
   Location Object (PIDF-LO).  The document assumes that a Location
   Recipient possesses a secure HELD URI that can be used in conjunction
   with the HELD protocol to request the location of the Target.

Internet-Draft         HELD Dereferencing Protocol             July 2009


1.  Introduction

   Provision of location information by reference
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements] involves the creation of a
   resource that is identified by a "location URI".  A "location URI"
   identifies resource that contains the location of an entity.  A
   location URI might be a temporary resource, created in response to a
   HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] request.  A location URI
   does not intrinsically include location information, instead the URI
   is "dereferenced" by a Location Recipient to acquire location
   information.  This document specifies how a holder of a location URI
   uses that URI to retrieve location information.

   The HELD protocol, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery], defines a use of HTTP that
   enables location configuration - the process where a Device acquires
   location information about itself.  A part of location configuration
   is the provision of a location URI.  However, HELD does not describe
   how such a URI is used; this document provides that definition.

   This document defines how HELD is used by a Location Recipient to
   dereference a location URI and acquire location information.  The
   result of this process is location object in the form of a Presence
   Information Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO) document
   [RFC4119].  A constrained set of HELD features are defined such that
   it is suitable for use as a location dereference protocol
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements].  Use as a location dereference
   protocol requires use of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) binding
   for HTTP [RFC2818] in order to provide confidentiality,
   authentication and protection from modification.

   Use of HELD as a dereferencing protocol has the advantage that the
   Location Recipient can indicate the type of location information it
   would like to receive.  This functionality is already available with
   the HELD base specification, described in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery].  Furthermore, the HELD
   response from the LIS towards the Location Recipient not only
   provides the PIDF-LO but also encapsulates supplementary information,
   such as error messages, back to the Location Recipient.

   Location URIs created for use with HELD dereferencing use the
   "https:" or "http:" scheme for the HTTP binding of HELD.  The
   behaviour described in this document can be used by Location
   Recipients that are aware of the fact that the URI is a location URI.

   An example scenario envisioned by this document is shown in Figure 1.
   This diagram shows how a location dereference protocol fits with

   location configuration and conveyance.
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements] contains more information on
   this scenario and others like it.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses key terminology from several sources:

   o  terms for the GEOPRIV reference model defined in [RFC3693] and
      [I-D.barnes-geopriv-lo-sec];

   o  the term Location Information Server (LIS), from
      [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps], is a node in the access network that
      provides location information to an end point; a LIS provides

Internet-Draft         HELD Dereferencing Protocol             July 2009


      location URIs;

   o  the term Location Server (LS), from [RFC3693], is used to identify
      the server that responds to a location dereference request; this
      might be the same entity as the LIS, but the model in
      [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements] allows for the existence of
      separate - but related - entities; and

   o  the term location URI is coined in
      [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements].

3.  Authorization Models

   This section discusses two extreme types of authorization models for
   dereferencing with HELD URIs, namely "Authorization by Possession"
   and "Authorization by Access Control".  In the subsequent subsections
   we discuss the properties of these two models.  These two models can,
   however, be used in combination in a real deployment.  Figure 2, from
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements], shows the model applicable to
   location configuration, conveyance and dereference.

   It is important to note that this document does not mandate a
   specific authorization model, nor does it constrain the usage with
   regard to these models in any way.  Additionally, it is possible to
   combine certain parts of both models.

   For either authorization model, the overall process is similar.  The

Internet-Draft         HELD Dereferencing Protocol             July 2009


   following steps are followed, with minor alterations:

   1.  The Target acquires a location URI from the LIS.  This might use
       HELD as a location configuration protocol (LCP).

   2.  The Target then conveys the location URI to a third party, the
       Location Recipient (for example using SIP as described in
       [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance]).  This step is shown in (2)
       of Figure 2.

   3.  The Location Recipient then needs to dereference the location URI
       in order to obtain the Location Object (3).  Depending on the URI
       scheme of the location URI dereferencing might, as is the case
       for "https:" or "http:" URIs, be performed as described in this
       document.

   In this final step, the Location Server (LS) or LIS makes an
   authorization decision.  How this decision is reached depends on the
   authorization model.

3.1.  Authorization by Possession

   In this model, possession - or knowledge - of the location URI is
   used to control access to location information.  A location URI is
   constructed such that it is hard to guess (see C9 of
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements]) and the set of entities that it
   is disclosed to is limited.  The only authentication required by the
   LS is evidence of possession of the URI.  The LS is able to
   immediately authorize any request that indicates this URI.

   Authorization by possession uses a very simple policy that does not
   typically require direct interaction with a Rule Maker; it is assumed
   that the Rule Maker is able to exert control over the distribution of
   the location URI.  Therefore, the LIS can operate with limited policy
   input from a Rule Maker.

   Limited disclosure is an important aspect of this authorization
   model.  The location URI is a secret; therefore, ensuring that
   adversaries are not able to acquire this information is paramount.
   Encryption, such as might be offered by TLS [RFC5246] or S/MIME
   [RFC3851], protects the information from eavesdroppers.

   Use of authorization by possession location URIs in a hop-by-hop
   protocol such as SIP [RFC3261] adds the possibility of on-path
   adversaries.  Depending on the usage of the location URI for certain
   location based applications (e.g., emergency services, location based
   routing) specific treatment is important, as discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance].



Winterbottom, et al.    Expires January 28, 2010                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         HELD Dereferencing Protocol             July 2009


   Using possession as a basis for authorization means that, once
   granted, authorization cannot be easily revoked.  Cancellation of a
   location URI ensures that legitimate users are also affected;
   application of additional policy is theoretically possible, but could
   be technically infeasible.  Therefore, other measures are provided to
   prevent an adversary from gaining access to location information
   indefinitely.

   A very simple policy is established at the time that the location URI
   is created.  This policy specifies that the location URI expires
   after a certain time, which limits any inadvertent exposure of
   location information to adversaries.  The expiration time of the
   location URI might be negotiated at the time of its creation, as is
   the case with [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context].

3.2.  Authorization via Access Control

   Use of explicit access control provides a Rule Maker greater control
   over the behaviour of an LS.  In contrast to authorization by
   possession, possession of a this form of location URI does not imply
   authorization.  Since an explicit policy is used to authorize access
   to location information, the location URI can be distributed to many
   potential Location Recipients.

   Either before creation or dissemination of the location URI, the Rule
   Maker establishes an authorization policy with the LS.  In reference
   to Figure 2, authorization policies might be established at creation
   (Step 1), and need to be established before before the location URI
   is published (Step 2) to ensure that the policy grants access to the
   desired Location Recipients.  Depending on the mechanism used, it
   might also be possible to change authorization policies at any time.

   A possible format for these authorization policies is available with
   GEOPRIV Common Policy [RFC4745] and Geolocation Policy
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy].  Additional constraints might be
   established by other means.

   The LS enforces the authorization policy when a Location Recipient
   dereferences the URI.  Explicit authorization policies allow a Rule
   Maker to specify the identity of Location Recipients, constrain the
   accuracy and form of location information, and to control other
   aspects of the authorization process.

4.  HELD Dereference Protocol

   This section describes how HELD can be used to dereference a location
   URI.  This process can be applied when a Location Recipient is in
   possession of a location URI with a "https:" or "http:" URI scheme.



Winterbottom, et al.    Expires January 28, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         HELD Dereferencing Protocol             July 2009


   A Location Recipient that wishes to dereference an "https:" or
   "http:" URI performs a HELD request on HTTP to the identified
   resource.

   Note:  In many cases, an "http:" URI does not provide sufficient
      security for location URIs.  The absence of the security
      mechanisms provided by TLS means that the Rule Maker has no
      control over who receives location information and the Location
      Recipient has no assurance that the information is correct.

   The Location Recipient establishes a connection to the LS, as
   described in [RFC2818].  The TLS ciphersuite TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL
   MUST NOT be used.  The LS MUST be authenticated to ensure that the
   correct server is contacted.  Given that a location URI does not
   indicate the authorization model used, the Location Recipient MUST be
   prepared to provide authentication information unless it has external
   information on the authorization model used by the URI.  This
   document does not specify how the LS authenticates the Location
   Recipient; however, a Location Recipient MUST support provision of a
   client certificate during TLS session creation and HTTP digest
   authentication [RFC2617], unless these authentication methods are
   known to be inapplicable.

4.1.  HELD Usage Profile

   Use of HELD as a location dereference protocol is largely the same as
   its use as a location configuration protocol.  Aside from the
   restrictions noted in this document, HELD semantics do not differ
   from those established in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery].

   The HELD "locationRequest" is the only request permitted by this
   specification.  Similarly, request parameters other than the
   following MUST NOT be accepted by the LS:  "responseTime",
   "locationType" (including the associated "exact" attribute).  Other
   specifications MUST explicitly describe whether other requests or
   parameters apply to dereference requests and how they are to be
   interpreted if they are permitted.  The LS MUST ignore any parameters
   that it does not understand unless it knows the parameters to be
   invalid, such as those defined in
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-identity-extensions].  If parameters
   are known to be invalid, the LS MAY generate a HELD error response.

   The LS MUST NOT generate any location URIs or provide a
   "locationUriSet" in response to a dereference request.  If the
   location request contains a "locationType" element that includes
   "locationURI", this parameter is either ignored or rejected as
   appropriate, based on the associated "exact" attribute.

Internet-Draft         HELD Dereferencing Protocol             July 2009


   This document requires additional HTTP features from Location
   Recipients that are not required of Devices in HELD.  HTTP digest
   authentication [RFC2617] MUST be supported by Location Recipients,
   unless there is no means to provide such authentication information.

5.  Examples

   The example in Figure 3 shows the simplest form of dereferencing
   request using HELD to the location URI
   "https://ls.example.com:49152/uri/w3g61nf5n66p0".  The only way that
   this differs from the example in Section 10.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] is in the request URI and
   the source of the URI.

   POST /uri/w3g61nf5n66p0 HTTP/1.1
   Host: ls.example.com:49152
   Content-Type: application/held+xml
   Content-Length: 87

   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held"/>

                  Figure 3: Minimal Dereferencing Request

   Figure 4 shows the response to the previous request listing both
   civic and geodetic location information of the Target's location.  If
   this looks similar to the response in Section 10.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery], that is no coincidence -
   unless policy specfies otherwise, the Location Recipient receives the
   same information as the Device.

6.  Security Considerations

   Privacy of location information is the most important security
   consideration for this document.  Two measures in particular are used
   to protect privacy:  TLS and authorization policies.  TLS provides a
   means of ensuring confidentiality of location information through
   encryption and mutual authentication.  An authorization policy allows
   a Rule Maker to explicitly control how location information is
   provided to Location Recipients.  The process by which a Rule Maker
   establishes an authorization policy is not covered by this document;
   several methods are possible, for instance:
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context], [RFC4825].

Internet-Draft         HELD Dereferencing Protocol             July 2009


   Use of TLS for the dereferencing of location URIs is strongly
   RECOMMENDED, as discussed in Section 4.1.  Location Recipients MUST
   authenticate the host identity using the domain name included in the
   location URI, using the procedure described in Section 3.1 of
   [RFC2818].  Local policy determines what a Location Recipient does is
   authentication fails, or is not attempted.

   The authorization by possession model (Section 3.1) further relies on
   TLS when transmitting the location URI to protect the secrecy of the
   URI.  Possession of such a URI implies the same privacy
   considerations as possession of the PIDF-LO document that the URI
   references.  This is necessary, since the policy attached to such a
   location URI permits any who have the URI to view it.  This aspect of
   security is covered in more detail in the specification of location
   conveyance protocols, such as [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance].

   The Location Recipient MUST be prepared to provide authentication
   credentials when making a dereference request.

   To comply with identity protection requirements in [RFC3693], the LS
   MUST NOT include any information that could be used to identify a
   Target, unless policy is provided that allows this.  To this end, an
   unlinked pseudonym MUST be provided in the "entity" attribute of the
   PIDF-LO document.

   Further security considerations and requirements relating to the use
   of location URIs are described in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements].

Appendix A.  GEOPRIV Using Protocol Compliance

   This section describes how use of HELD as a location dereference
   protocol complies with the GEOPRIV requirements described in
   [RFC3693].

   Req. 1.  (Location Object generalities):

            This section relates to the PIDF-LO [RFC4119] document,
            which is used by HELD.  These requirements are addressed by
            [RFC4119] and [RFC5491].

   Req. 2.  (Location Object fields):

            This section relates to the PIDF-LO [RFC4119] document,
            which is used by HELD.  These requirements are addressed by
            [RFC4119] and [RFC5491].

Internet-Draft         HELD Dereferencing Protocol             July 2009


   Req. 3.  (Location Data Types):

            This section relates to the PIDF-LO [RFC4119] document,
            which is used by HELD.  These requirements are addressed by
            [RFC4119] and [RFC5491].

   Section 7.2 of [RFC3693] details the requirements of a "Using
   Protocol".  These requirements are repeated here for reference,
   followed by a statement of compliance:

   Req. 4.  "The using protocol has to obey the privacy and security
            instructions coded in the Location Object and in the
            corresponding Rules regarding the transmission and storage
            of the LO."

            Compliant:  This document carries the PIDF-LO as is via
            HTTPS from the LIS to the Location Recipient.  The sending
            and receiving parties must obey the instructions carried
            inside the object.

   Req. 5.  "The using protocol will typically facilitate that the keys
            associated with the credentials are transported to the
            respective parties, that is, key establishment is the
            responsibility of the using protocol."

            Compliant:  This document specifies that authentication of
            the LS uses the established public key infrastructure used
            by HTTP over TLS [RFC2818].  Location Recipient is
            accomplished using certificates exchanged using TLS, or
            through HTTP digest authentication [RFC2617].
            Authentication of Location Recipients as specified in this
            document requires pre-arrangement; further key establishment
            methods are left to later work.

   Req. 6.  "(Single Message Transfer) In particular, for tracking of
            small target devices, the design should allow a single
            message/packet transmission of location as a complete
            transaction."

            Not Compliant:  The XML encoding specified in [RFC4119] is
            not suited to single packet transfers.  It is not the goal
            of this document to define a new Location Object format.

   Section 7.3 of [RFC3693] details the requirements of a "Rule based
   Location Data Transfer".  These requirements are repeated where they
   are applicable to this document:





Winterbottom, et al.    Expires January 28, 2010               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft         HELD Dereferencing Protocol             July 2009


   Req. 7.   "(LS Rules) The decision of a Location Server to provide a
             Location Recipient access to Location Information MUST be
             based on Rule Maker-defined Privacy Rules."

             Compliance or Not Applicable:  This document describes two
             alternative methods by which a Rule Maker is able to
             control access to location information.  Rule Maker policy
             is enforced by the LS when a location URI is dereferenced.
             However, this document does not describe how a location URI
             is created, or how a Rule Maker associates policy with a
             location URI.  These are outside the scope of this
             document.

   Req. 8.   (LG Rules) Not Applicable:  This relationship between LS
             and the source of its information (be that Location
             Generator (LG) or LIS) is out of scope for this document.

   Req. 9.   "(Viewer Rules) A Viewer does not need to be aware of the
             full Rules defined by the Rule Maker (because a Viewer
             SHOULD NOT retransmit Location Information), and thus a
             Viewer SHOULD receive only the subset of Privacy Rules
             necessary for the Viewer to handle the LO in compliance
             with the full Privacy Rules (such as, instruction on the
             time period for which the LO can be retained)."

             Compliant:  The Rule Maker might define (via mechanisms
             outside the scope of this document) which policy rules are
             disclosed to other entities.  For instance, if [RFC4745] is
             used to convey authorization policies from Rule Maker to
             LS, this is possible using the parameters specified in
             [I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy].

   Req. 10.  (Full Rule language) Not Applicable:  Note however that
             Geopriv has defined a rule language capable of expressing a
             wide range of privacy rules (see [RFC4745] and
             [I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy].

   Req. 11.  (Limited Rule language) Not Applicable:  This requirement
             applies to (and is addressed by) PIDF-LO [RFC4119].

   Section 7.4 of [RFC3693] details the requirements of "Location Object
   Privacy and Security".  These requirements are repeated where they
   are applicable to this document:

   Req. 12.  (Identity Protection) Potentially Compliant:  Identity
             protection of the Target is provided as long as both of the
             following conditions are true:




Winterbottom, et al.    Expires January 28, 2010               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft         HELD Dereferencing Protocol             July 2009


             (a)  the location URI is not associated with the identity
                  of the Target in any context, and

             (b)  if the PIDF-LO does not contain information about the
                  identity about the Target.

             For instance, this requirement is complied with if the
             protocol that conveys the location URI does not link the
             identity of the Target to the location URI and the LS
             doesn't include meaningful identification information in
             the PIDF-LO document.  Section 6 recommends that an
             unlinked pseudonym is used by the LS.

   Req. 13.  (Credential Requirements) Compliant:  The primary security
             mechanism specified in this document is Transport Layer
             Security.  TLS offers the ability to use different types of
             credentials, including symmetric, asymmetric credentials or
             a combination of them.

   Req. 14.  (Security Features) Compliant:  Geopriv defines a few
             security requirements for the protection of Location
             Objects such as mutual end-point authentication, data
             object integrity, data object confidentiality and replay
             protection.  The ability to use Transport Layer security
             fulfills these requirements.

   Req. 15.  (Minimal Crypto) Compliant:  The mandatory to implement
             ciphersuite is provided in the TLS layer security
             specification.

Appendix B.  Compliance to Location Reference Requirements

   This section describes how HELD complies to the location reference
   requirements stipulated in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements].
   Compliance to the Location Configuration Protocol are included in
   this document.

      Note that use of HELD as a location dereference protocol does not
      necessarily imply that HELD is the corresponding LCP.  This
      document is still applicable to "held:" location URIs that are
      acquired by other means.

B.1.  Requirements for a Location Configuration Protocol








Winterbottom, et al.    Expires January 28, 2010               [Page 21]

Internet-Draft         HELD Dereferencing Protocol             July 2009


   C1.   "location URI support:  The configuration protocol MUST support
         a location reference in URI form."

         Compliant:  HELD only provides location references in URI form.

   C2.   "location URI expiration:  When a location URI has a limited
         validity interval, its lifetime MUST be indicated."

         Compliant:  HELD indicates the expiry time of location URIs
         using the "expires" attribute.  HELD contexts
         [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context] also expire, and an
         explicit indication is included in the context response; a
         Device is able to specify limits on the life time of a HELD
         context.

   C3.   "location URI cancellation:  The location configuration
         protocol MUST support the ability to request a cancellation of
         a specific location URI."

         Compliant conditional on on the source of the location URI:
         HELD contexts [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context] can be
         explicitly removed.  HELD does not provide a method for
         cancelling location URIs.

   C4.   "Location Information Masking:  The location URI form MUST,
         through randomization and uniqueness, ensure that any location
         specific information embedded within the location URI itself is
         kept obscure during location configuration."

         Compliant:  The HELD specification explicitly references this
         requirement in providing guidance on the format of the location
         URI.

   C5.   "User Identity Protection:  The location URI MUST NOT contain
         any user identifying information that identifies the user,
         device or address of record, (e.g., which includes phone
         extensions, badge numbers, first or last names, etc.), within
         the URI form."

         Compliant:  The HELD specification provides specific guidance
         on the anonymity of the Target with regards to the generation
         of location URIs.  Section 6 expands on this guidance.

   C6.   "Reuse indicator:  There SHOULD be a way to allow a client to
         control whether a location URI can be resolved once only, or
         multiple times."

         Compliant:  The default semantics of location URIs in HELD



Winterbottom, et al.    Expires January 28, 2010               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft         HELD Dereferencing Protocol             July 2009


         place no limits on the number of times that a location URI can
         be dereferenced.

   C7.   "Validity Interval Indication:  A location configuration
         protocol MUST provide an indication of the location URI
         validity interval (i.e., expiry time) when present."

         Duplicate Requirement:  As above.

   C8.   "Location only:  The location URI MUST NOT point to any
         information about the Target other than it's location."

         Compliance depends on implementation:  A PIDF-LO document can
         contain information other than location, but no protocol
         semantics exist that allow for or encourage inclusion of other
         information.

   C9.   "Location URI Not guessable:  Where location URIs are used
         publicly, any location URI MUST be constructed using properties
         of uniqueness and cryptographically random sequences so that it
         is not guessable."

         Compliant:  HELD specifies that location URIs conform to this
         requirement.

   C10.  "Location URI Optional:  In the case of user-provided
         authorization policies, where anonymous or non-guessable
         location URIs are not warranted, the location configuration
         protocol MAY support optional location URI forms."

         Not Compliant:  HELD does not support Device-specified location
         URI forms.

   C11.  "Location URI Authorization Model:  The location configuration
         protocol SHOULD indicate whether the requested location URI
         conforms to the access control authorization model or the
         possession authorization model."

         Compliant:  HELD explicitly indicates that the possession model
         applies to all URIs.

   C12.  "Location URI Lifetime:  A location URI SHOULD have an
         associated expiration lifetime (i.e., validity interval), and
         MUST have an validity interval if used with the possession
         authorization model."

         Duplicate Requirement:  As above.

B.2.  Requirements for a Location Dereference Protocol

   D1.   "Location URI support:  The location dereference protocol MUST
         support a location reference in URI form."

         Compliant:  HELD only provides location references in URI form.

   D2.   "Validity Interval Indication:  A location dereference protocol
         MUST provide an indication of the location URI validity
         interval (i.e., expiry time) when present."

         Invalid Requirement:  not applicable to location dereference
         protocols.

   D3.   "Authentication:  The location dereference protocol MUST
         include mechanisms to authenticate both the client and the
         server."

         Compliant:  TLS provides means for mutual authentication.  This
         document only specifies the required mechanism for server
         authentication.

   D4.   "Dereferenced Location Form:  The value returned by the
         dereference protocol MUST contain a well-formed PIDF-LO
         document."

         Compliant:  HELD requires that location objects are in the form
         of a PIDF-LO that complies with [RFC5491].

   D5.   "Location URI Repeated Use:  The location dereference protocol
         MUST support the ability for the same location URI to be
         resolved more than once, based on dereference server
         configuration."

         Compliant:  A Location Recipient may access and use a location
         URI as many times as desired until URI expiration results in
         the URI being invalidated.  Authorization policies might
         include rules that modify this behavior.

   D6.   "Validity Interval Indication:  A dereference protocol MUST
         provide an indication of the location URI validity interval
         (i.e., expiry time) when present."

         Not Compliant:  This document does not provide this indication
         - this information is arguably useful to a Location Recipient,
         but it also reveals something about the policy associated with
         the location URI.  Without also providing a mechanism to
         suppress this capability and hide the expiry time, this might

         reveal more information than a Rule Maker is willing to share.

   D7.   "Location URI anonymized:  Any location URI whose dereference
         will not be subject to authentication and access control MUST
         be anonymized."

         Not applicable to location dereference protocols - applies to
         the creation of the URI.

   D8.   "Location Information Masking:  The location URI form MUST,
         through randomization and uniqueness, ensure that any location
         specific information embedded within the location URI itself is
         kept obscure during location URI dereferencing."

         Not applicable to location dereference protocols - applies to
         the creation of the URI.

   D9.   "Location Privacy:  The location dereference protocol MUST
         support the application of privacy rules to the dissemination
         of a requested location object."

         Compliant:  Authorization policy must be applied by the LS for
         all attempts at dereferencing.  Note that in the case of
         authorization by possession, this authorization policy grants
         access to location information based on proof of knowledge of
         the location URI.

   D10.  "Location Confidentiality:  The dereference protocol MUST
         support encryption of messages sent between the location
         dereference client and the location dereference server, and MAY
         alternatively provide messaging unencrypted."

         Compliant:  This document strongly recommends the use of TLS
         for confidentiality.  Unsecured HTTP is permitted, and some of
         the associated risks are described in Section 4.1.

   D11.  "Location URI Authorization Model:  The location dereference
         protocol SHOULD indicate whether the requested location URI
         conforms to the access control authorization model or the
         possession authorization model."

         Not Compliant:  The basis of an authorization decision is
         potentially private information; this document does not provide
         this indication.  Note that the recipient of a location URI is
         expected to respect the confidentiality of a location URI as if
         it were secret, even if it is not.
