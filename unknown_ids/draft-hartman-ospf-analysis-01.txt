1.  Introduction

   This document performs the initial analysis of the current state of
   OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 according to the requirements of
   [I-D.ietf-karp-design-guide].  This draft builds on several previous
   analysis efforts into routing security.  The OPSEC working group put
   together [I-D.ietf-opsec-routing-protocols-crypto-issues] an analysis
   of cryptographic issues with routing protocols.  Earlier, the RPSEC
   working group put together [I-D.ietf-rpsec-ospf-vuln] a detailed
   analysis of OSPF vulnerabilities.

3.  Current State

   This section describes the security mechanisms built into OSPFv2 and
   OSPFv3.

3.1.  OSPFv2

   Appendix D of [RFC2328] describes the basic procedure for
   cryptographic authentication in OSPFv2.  An authentication data field
   in the OSPF packet header contains a key ID, the length of the
   authentication data and a sequence number.  A message authentication
   code (MAC) is appended to the OSPF packet.  This code protects all
   fields of the packet including the sequence number.

   RFC 2328 defined the use of a keyed-MD5 MAC.  While MD5 has not been
   broken as a MAC, it is not the algorithm of choice for new MACs.

   RFC 5709 [RFC5709] adds support for the SHA [FIPS180] family of
   hashes to OSPFv2.  The cryptographic authentication described in RFC
   5709 meets modern standards for per-packet integrity protection.  In
   order to provide cryptographic algorithms beleived to have a
   relatively long useful life, RFC 5709 mandates support for SHA-2
   rather than SHA-1.

   These security services provide integrity protection on each packet.
   In addition, limited replay detection is provided.  The sequence
   number is non-decreasing.  So, once a router has increased its
   sequence number, an attacker cannot replay an old packet.  See
   Section 4 for discussion of the impacts of these replay attacks.

   The mechanism provides good support for key rollover.  There is a key
   ID; in addition mechanisms are described for managing key lifetimes
   and starting the use of a new key in an orderly manner.  Performing
   orderly key rollover requires that implementations support accepting
   a new key for received packets before using that key to generate
   packets.  Section D.3 of RFC 2328 requires this support in the form
   of four configurable lifetimes for each key: two lifetimes control
   the beginning and ending period for acceptance while two lifetimes
   control the beginning and ending period for generation.

3.2.  OSPFv3

   RFC 4552 [RFC4552] describes how the authentication header and
   encapsulating security payload mechanism can be used to protect
   OSPFv3 packets.  This mechanism provides per-packet integrity and
   optional confidentiality using a wide variety of cryptographic
   algorithms.  Because OSPF uses multicast traffic, only manual key
   management is supported.

   The Security Parameter Index (SPI) provides an identifier for the
   security association.  This along with other IPsec facilities
   provides a mechanism for moving from one key to another.

   Because manual keying is used, no replay protection is provided for
   OSPFv3.

4.  Replay Detection

   In OSPFv2, two facilities limit the scope of replay attacks.  First,
   when cryptographic authentication is used, each packet includes a
   sequence number that is non-decreasing.  In the current
   specifications, the sequence number is remembered as part of an
   adjacency: if an attacker can cause an adjacency to go down, then
   replay state is lost.  Database Description packets also include a
   per-LSA sequence number that is part of the information that is
   flooded.  Even if a packet is replayed, the per-LSA sequence number
   will prevent an old LSA from being installed.  Unlike the per-packet
   sequence number, the per-LSA sequence number must increase when an
   LSA is changed.

   While the LSA sequence number provides some defense, there are a
   number of attacks that are possible because of a per-packet replay.
   The RPSEC analysis [I-D.ietf-rpsec-ospf-vuln] describes a number of
   attacks that are possible because of per-packet replays.  The most
   serious appear to be attacks against Hello packets, which may cause
   an adjacency to fail.  Other attacks may cause excessive flooding or
   excessive use of CPU.

   Another serious attack concerns Database Description packets.  In
   addition to the per-packet sequence number that is part of
   cryptographic authentication for OSPFv2 and the per-LSA sequence
   numbers, Database Description packets also include a Database
   Description sequence number.  If a Database Description packet with
   the incorrect sequence number is received, then the database exchange
   process will be restarted.

   The per-packet OSPFv2 sequence number can be used to reduce the
   window in which a replay is valid.  A receiver will harmlessly reject
   a packet whose per-packet sequence number is older than the one most
   recently received from a neighbor.  Replaying the most recent packet
   from a neighbor does not appear to create problems.  So, if the per-
   packet sequence number is incremented on every packet sent, then
   replay attacks should not disrupt OSPFv2.  Unfortunately, OSPFv2 does
   not have a procedure for dealing with sequence numbers reaching the
   maximum age.  It may be possible to figure out a set of rules
   sufficient to disrupt the damage of packet replays while minimizing
   the use of the sequence number space.

   As mentioned previously, when an adjacency is dropped, replay state
   is lost.  So, after rebooting or when all adjacencies are lost, a
   router may allow its sequence number to decrease.  An attacker can
   cause significant damage by replaying a packet captured before the
   sequence number decrease at a time after the sequence number
   decrease.  If this happens, then the replayed packet will be accepted

   and the sequence number will be updated.  However, the ligitimate
   sender will be using a lower sequence number, so legitimate packets
   will be rejected.  A similar attack is possible in cases where OSPF
   identifies a neighbor based on source address.  An attacker can
   change the source address of a captured packet and replay it.  If the
   attacker causes a replay from a neighbor with a high sequence number
   to appear to be from a low sequence number neighbor, then
   connectivity with that neighbor will be disrupted until the adjacency
   fails.

   OSPFv3 lacks the per-packet sequence number but has the per-LSA
   sequence number.  As such, OSPFv3 has no defense against denial of
   service attacks that exploit replay.

5.  IP Layer Issues

   The OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication does not include the IP
   header.  So, fields like the source address are not protected.  The
   OSPF specification uses the source address in some locations: for
   some network types, the source address is used to match which
   neighbor a packet is from.  Changing the source address of a packet
   can produce a number of denial of service attacks.  If the packet is
   interpreted as coming from a different neighbor, the sequence number
   received from the neighbor may be updated.  This may disrupt
   communication with the legitimate neighbor.  Hello packets may be
   reflected to cause a neighbor to appear to have one-way
   communication.  Old Database descriptions may be reflected in cases
   where the per-packet sequence numbers are sufficiently divergent in
   order to disrupt an adjacency.

   RFC 4552 requires the support of ESP and permits the use of AH.  ESP
   does not provide any protection of the IP source address .  Ah does
   provide such protection.Similarly, ESP does not provide protection
   against the insertion, deletion, or modification of any optional IPv6
   headers in the OSPFv3 packet, while AH does provide that protection.

6.  Packet Prioritization

   OSPF implementations generally prioritize packets in order to
   minimize disruption when router resources such as CPU or memory
   experience contention.  This can cause complications for the OSPFv2
   packet replay mechanism.  As specified, if packets are processed out-
   of-order, then the skipped packets may be discarded if the sequence
   number increased.  Refinements to the replay mechanism need to keep
   this usage in mind.

   When IPsec is used with OSPFv3, the offset of the packet type, which
   is used to prioritize packets, depends on what integrity transform is
   used.  For this reason, prioritizing packets may be more complex for
   OSPFv3.  One approach is to establish per-SPI filters to find the
   packet type and act accordingly.

7.  OSPF Security Requirements

   This section describes requirements for OSPF security that should be
   met within the routing protocol.

   As with all routing protocols, per-packet protection with a
   cryptographic MAC is required.

   Mechanisms are required in order to support key rollover.  Multiple
   approaches could be used.  However since the existing mechanisms
   provide a protocol field to identify the key as well as management
   mechanisms to introduce and retire new keys, focusing on the existing
   mechanism as a starting point is prudent.

   Replay protection is required.  The replay mechanism needs to be
   sufficient to prevent an attacker from creating a denial of service
   or disrupting the integrity of the routing protocol by replaying
   packets.  It is important that an attacker not be able to disrupt
   service by capturing packets and waiting for replay state to be lost.

8.  Gap Analysis

8.1.  OSPFv2 Replay Mechanism

   The OSPFv2 mechanism allows an attacker to replay packets until the
   sequence number increases.  Implementations are expected to increase
   their sequence number once a second or so.  As discussed in
   Section 4, this strategy creates several opportunities for attack.

   In order to avoid significant denial of service issues, the replay
   mechanism needs to be improved.  Part of this improvement may come
   simply from rules about when the sequence number should be increased.
   Other improvements are required to prevent attacks where an old
   replay is made either when an adjacency is down or from a time when a
   sequence number is significantly greater than the current sequence
   number to disrupt an association.

8.2.  OSPFv3 Replay

   The replay vulnerabilities for OSPFv3 are greater than for OSPFv2.
   There is no mechanism providing replay protection at all.  Even for
   manual keying, some replay mechanism is required.

8.3.  IP Header

   OSPF depends on fields in the IP header, particularly the source
   address.  These fields are not integrity protected.  This interacts
   particularly badly with the OSPFv2 replay mechanism, although other
   attacks are also possible.

9.  Security Considerations

   This memo discusses and compiles vulnerabilities in the existing OSPF
   cryptographic handling.

   In analyzing proposed improvements to OSPF per-packet security, it is
   desirable to consider how these improvements interact with potential
   improvements in overall routing security.  For example, the impact of
   replay attacks currently depends on the LSA sequence number
   mechanism.  If cryptographic protections against insider attackers
   are considered by future work, then that work will need to provide a
   solution that meets the needs of the per-packet replay defense as
   well as protection of routing data from insider attack.  RFC 2154
   [RFC2154] provides an experimental solution for end-to-end protection
   of routing data in OSPF.  It may be beneficial to consider how
   improvements to the per-packet protections would interact with such a
   mechanism to future-proof these mechanisms.
