Abstract

   This document extends the stability of 6to4 routing by defining the
   global anycast route 2002::/16 as a route of last resort. More
   specific unicast routes might be allowed in order to create a more
   stable environment.

1. Introduction

   6to4 [RFC3056] defines a successful technology to connect IPv6 net-
   works over legacy only backbones. By allowing large ISPs to announce
   a more specific of the default anycast route, the operational domain
   of unicast 6to4 is extended from the SP network under its direct con-
   trol to the global network. From the perspective of customer sites
   and the IPv6 Internet at large connected to the 6to4 SP network, the
   IPv6 service provided is equivalent to native IPv6.

2. Allowing more specific unicast routes

   The relevant part of section 5.2 of RFC3056

      6to4 prefixes more specific than 2002::/16 must not be propagated
      in native IPv6 routing, to prevent pollution of the IPv6 routing
      table by elements of the IPv4 routing table. Therefore, a 6to4
      site which also has a native IPv6 connection MUST NOT advertise
      its 2002::/48 routing prefix on that connection, and all native
      IPv6 network operators MUST filter out and discard any 2002::
      routing prefix advertisements longer than /16.

   is changed to

      6to4 prefixes more specific than 2002::/16 are allowed to be prop-
      agated in native IPv6 routing, as long as the more specific matchs
      exactly the mapped most aggregated IPv4 route originated by the
      same AS. In order to prevent misuse, the route objects in the
      routing databases for such more specifics can only be created by
      the RIR which allocated the corresponding IPv4 prefix.

3. Rationale

      Several 6to4 routers out there are broken and nobody cares about
      fixing them. There is not enough 6to4 deployment to fix those
      problems by reporting errors.

      In order to provide stable routing over their IPv4-only backbones
      ISPs prefers to keep the 6to4 traffic as long as possible in the
      IPv6 network. One proposal ist 6rd [I-D.ietf-softwire-ipv6-6rd]
      with allows every ISP to assign it's own unicast prefix similar to
      2002::/16. This is a huge waste of address space.

      Announcing more specifics of an anycast default route allows oper-
      ators to drop routing announcements without disrupting the ser-
      vice. This way the impact to the local routing tables can be mini-
      mized, if necessary.

4. Security Considerations

      Announcing more specifics drastically changes the routing system.
      In order to obtain the same result for the anycast and the unicast
      routing, the originating AS for the more specific unicast 6to4
      route MUST match the originating AS for the corresponding, valid
      IPv4 route.

      In order to ease filtering at BGP level, route objects SHOULD NOT
      be created and maintained by any LIR itself. The RIR allocating
      the IPv4 address space MUST create an corresponding route object
      for unicast 6to4 routes on request. More specifics than route for
      the corresponding IPv4 allocate SHOULD NOT be created.

5. IANA Considerations

      No assignments by the IANA are required.
