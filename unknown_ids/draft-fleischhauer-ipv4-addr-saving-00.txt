    On demand IPv4 address provisioning in Dual-Stack PPP deployment
                               scenarios

Abstract

   Today the Dual-Stack approach is the most straightforward and most
   common way for introducing IPv6 into existing systems and networks.
   However a typical drawback of implementing Dual-Stack is that each
   node will still require at least one IPv4 address.  Hence, solely
   deploying Dual-Stack does not provide a sufficient solution to the
   IPv4 address exhaustion problem.  Assuming a situation where most of
   the IP communication (e.g. always-on, VoIP etc.) can be provided via
   IPv6, the usage of IPv4 addresses can significantly be reduced and
   the unused IPv4 addresses can under certain circumstances be returned
   to the IPv4 address pool of the service provider.  New Dual-Stack
   enabled services can be introduced without increasing the IPv4
   address demand, when IPv6 will be the preferred network layer
   protocol.  This document describes such a solution in a Dual-Stack
   PPP session network scenario and explains the protocol mechanisms
   which are used.

1.  Abstract

   The Dual-Stack approach as defined in [RFC4213] provides the most
   straightforward and most common way for introducing IPv6 [RFC2460]
   into existing systems and networks.  However a typical drawback of
   the Dual-Stack approach is that each network node will still require
   at least one IPv4 [RFC0791] address.  Assuming a situation where most
   of the IP communication (e.g. always-on, VoIP etc.) can be provided
   via IPv6, the usage of IPv4 addresses can be reduced significantly
   and the unused IPv4 addresses may be returned to IPv4 address pool of
   the provider.  This document describes how such a solution can be
   realised in a Dual-Stack PPP session scenario and details the
   protocol mechanisms of the solution which are also thought as
   contribution to [BBF-WT-242].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]


2.  Problem Statement and Purpose of IPv4 address efficiency

   The Broadband Forum describes in [BBF-TR-187] a target IPv4/IPv6
   Dual-Stack Architecture (assuming native implementation of IPv6).
   TR-187 builds on the capabilities of existing protocols such as
   Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC1332] and Layer 2 Tunneling
   Protocol (L2TP) [RFC2661] to provide IPv6 service in addition to
   today's IPv4 service.  These protocols allow the parallel usage of
   IPv4 and IPv6 within a single PPP respectively L2TP session.  Because
   of the potential parallel usage of IPv4 and IPv6 within such a Dual-
   Stack PPP scenario an IPv4 address is always provisioned, also in the
   case where most of the communication is transported over IPv6.  This
   document extends the sketched Dual-Stack deployment scenario for PPP
   and L2TPv2 with an mechanism that allows a temporary assignment and a
   release of an unused IPv4 address within such a Dual-Stack capable
   PPP session scenario.  The IPv4 address may also only be provided on-
   demand later on, after initiating the Dual-Stack PPP session with an
   IPv6 address only.

2.1.  Communication in a PPP Dual-Stack environment

   Assuming a Dual-Stack network access via PPP sessions, end devices
   can in general communicate via IPv4 and/or IPv6 transport, depending
   of their own and their IP communication partners capabilities.  The
   actual usage of IPv4 or IPv6 or both protocols depends on the
   capabilities of the IP communication endpoints (e.g. protocol stack,

   applications, configuration of the preferences etc.), the network
   itself and also of the used communication services (like e.g.  VoIP).
   The later two are mainly in responsibility of the network and service
   provider.  The approach, sketched in this document, is based on the
   assumption that the customer starts a Dual-Stack PPP session in
   "IPv6-only" mode and "adds" IPv4 later on only in the case that
   applications or services explicitly request IPv4 connectivity.  When
   IPv4 connectivity is not needed during the whole time of PPP network
   connectivity than a continuous provisioning of a global IPv4 address
   to the customer device (e.g. end system, Home Gateway etc.) is not
   necessary.  Therefore mechanisms are needed in order to provision and
   release IPv4 addresses for Dual-Stack PPP sessions dynamically.

   |                                                                   |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+

                   Figure 1: PPP Dual-Stack architecture

   The goal of the solution sketched in this document, is to limit and
   decrease the IPv4 address pool size of the PPP network access
   provider.  Assuming that always-on services are reachable via IPv6, a
   Dual-Stack capable PPP connected device should per default request
   IPv4 address parameter only on demand, when the need for establishing
   IPv4 connectivity has been detected and IPv4 traffic towards the PPP
   WAN interface is intended.  As already described above it is
   sufficient, when initially only IPv6 address parameters are
   provisioned to the PPP customer endpoint (e.g. end systems, Home
   Gateway).  This means that this customer device does not initially
   start a complete Dual-Stack PPP session but an "IPv6 only" PPP
   session.  The IPv4 part of the complete Dual-Stack is initiated later
   on only in the case that IPv4 connectivity is explicitly requested.

2.2.  The advantage of the dynamic address assigning feature

   This approach is based on the assumption that the customer initiates
   a PPP session based on IPv6 and uses IPv4 only if applications or
   services request explicit IPv4 connectivity.  An IPv4 address can
   therefore provided sequentially to different customers during the
   runtime of their PPP connectivity.  This enables a smooth migration
   from IPv4 to IPv6 in comparison to other IPv4-IPv6 migration
   approaches (e.g.  NAT in the service provider network).  The customer
   will get global IPv4 connectivity only in the case when it is really
   needed and will not get an IPv4 address in each case per default when
   a Dual-Stack PPP session is initiated.  When IPv4 connectivity is not

   needed during the whole time of PPP network connectivity than a
   (continuous) provisioning a global IPv4 address to the HG is not
   necessary.  Therefore a provisioning of global IPv4 address can be
   done on-demand and dynamically during the PPP session.

   The goal of this solution approach is to limit and decrease the pool
   size for global IPv4 addresses at the service provider.

   A similar effect in limiting and decreasing the IPv4 address demand
   could also be achieved by using separate PPP sessions for IPv4 and
   IPv6.  But in that case the following problems occur:

   o  For each additional PPP session additional AAA parameter has to be
      created and used which leads to an extension on AAA domains and
      processes.

   o  Each additional PPP session will require additional resources on
      the PPP endpoints as well devices which act as an PPP intermediate
      agent.

   o  Accounting and controlling of traffic classes on an access line or
      customer base will be impeded.

   Because of these reasons the introduction of IPv6 as additional
   network layer protocol on a access line with a additional PPP session
   is not recommended.


3.  Specification

   As defined in RFC 2661 [RFC2661] PPP and L2TP provide the following
   main functionalities:

   1.  A method for encapsulating datagrams over serial links.

   2.  A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing, configuring, and
       testing the data-link connection.

   3.  (Optional) Authentication Protocol for one or both peers.

   4.  A family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and
       configuring different network-layer protocols.

   For provisioning of IPv4 or IPv6 communication parameter (e.g.
   addresses, DNS resolver) as network-layer protocols only the NCPs
   Internet Protocol (Version 4) Control Protocol (IPCP) RFC 1332
   [RFC1332] and Internet Protocol (Version 6) Control Protocol (IPV6CP)
   RFC 2472 [RFC2472] are used.  Whereas IPCP is responsible for

   configuring, enabling, and disabling the IPv4 protocol modules on
   both ends of the point-to-point link, IPV6CP is responsible for
   configuring, enabling, and disabling the IPv6 protocol modules on
   both ends of the point-to-point link.  Once one of both network-layer
   protocols has been configured, datagrams from each network-layer
   protocol can be sent over the link.  Both NCP protocol mechanisms are
   independent from each other (see also requirement WLL-3 in
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-cpe-router]).

   An implementation wishing to close a dedicated NCP connection (e.g.
   IPCP or IPv6CP) SHOULD transmit a Terminate-Request to the peer.
   Upon reception of a Terminate-Request, a Terminate-Ack MUST be
   transmitted to the sender of the Terminate-Request.

3.1.  Assigning IPv4 address parameter after established PPP and IPv6
      connectivity

   A PPP implementation wishing to open a connection MUST transmit a NCP
   Configure-Request to the peer.  If every Configuration Option
   received in a Configure-Request is recognizable and all values are
   acceptable, then the implementation MUST transmit a Configure-Ack to
   the sender of the NCP Configure-Request.

   Applied to the above sketched Dual-Stack PPP session use case the
   configuration and enabling of the IPv6 protocol module can be done
   immediately after a successful LCP data link configuration (and maybe
   successful authentication).

   Separately from that the IPv4 protocol module can be configured and
   enabled using IPCP.  However this SHALL only be done in the case that
   an IPv4 connectivity demand has been detected on the PPP customer end
   system or HG.  In this case the end system or HG send a IPCP
   Configure-Request to the BRAS.  The BRAS will request the IPv4
   connectivity parameter (e.g.  IPv4 address, DNS resolver address)
   from a local (e.g. within the BRAS) or remote (e.g. via RADIUS/
   DIAMETER) database and transmit these parameter within a Configure-
   Ack message to the PPP peer (e.g. end system, HG).

3.2.  Releasing unused IPv4 address parameter

   An implementation wishing to close a dedicated NCP connection (e.g.
   IPCP or IPv6CP) SHOULD transmit a Terminate-Request to the peer.
   Upon reception of a Terminate-Request, a Terminate-Ack MUST be
   transmitted to the sender of the Terminate-Request.

   The sending of the Terminate-Request message MUST be triggered from a
   IPv4 traffic idle timer within the PPP peer (e.g. end system, HG).
   After the timeout is reached the IPCP session can be terminated due
   sending an IPCP terminate request to the peer.  The request will be
   answered with an Terminate-Ack message.  The IPv4 address can be
   returned in a local (e.g. within the BRAS) or remote IPv4 address
   pool (e.g. via RADIUS/DIAMETER).

   As long as IPv6 connectivity is needed the PPP session MUST be kept
   open.  When no IPv6 connectivity is detected the PPP session can be
   terminated again by sending an IPv6CP Terminate-Request and accepting
   this by a Terminate-Ack.  Afterwards the link layer connectivity can
   be terminated by exchange the LCP Terminate-Request and Terminate-Ack
   messages.
