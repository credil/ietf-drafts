      <t>This document describes the extension of the format, use
      and communication of authentication names in the AFS-3 protocol
      to allow for additional authentication mechanisms to be
      represented and mapped to AFS IDs, independent of the AFS
      usernames currently used for management of PRDB entries.
      The new interface provides mechanisms for adding, removing, and
      listing mappings, and to allow the fileserver to map an
      authentication name to a PTS identity.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>AFS-3 provides an authentication ID mapping service to map
      authentication system names in Kerberos Version 4 format to
      AFS-3 numeric identifiers. An augmented Kerberos 4 server was
      historically part of the AFS-3 protocol and service suite.</t>

      <t>Security issues with Kerberos 4 as well as additional development
      in the space of authentication systems has created the need to
      map authentication names from other deployed systems to AFS
      identifiers. Some deployments provide several mechanisms to 
      obtain AFS authentication. While mappings between Kerberos 4
      and <xref target="RFC4120">Kerberos 5</xref> authentication names
      allow use of most Kerberos 5 deployments with AFS, supporting more
      than a single realm requires matching usernames in all realms. 
      Additionally, support for other systems is not provided at all.</t>

      <t>An administrator or a user may know which authentication
      identities belong to the same individual, service, or role. However,
      not all deployments need to support interactive remapping; one use
      case could involve re-exporting another naming service via the
      AFS-3 PTS protocol, in which case only the name to identifier and
      identifier to name services would be provided.</t>

      <t>The deployment implications for a mapping service are described
      below in <xref target="recommended_usage"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

        <section title="Conventions Used in this Document">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Background information on operation of AFS">
      <t>AFS is a distributed file system organized administratively
      into cells.  In current practice, each AFS cell consists of one or
      more Volume Location Database (VLDB) servers, one or more
      Protection Service (PTS) servers, and one or more pairs of file
      servers and volume servers, plus possibly additional services
      not relevant to this document. Data stored in AFS is divided
      into collections of files called volumes. An AFS protocol client,
      when accessing a file within a specific AFS cell, first contacts
      a VLDB server for that cell to determine the file server for the
      AFS volume in which that file is located, and then contacts that
      file server directly to access the file. A client may also need
      to contact a PTS server for that cell to register before accessing
      files in that cell. All communication is via remote procedure
      calls ('RPCs'), both between component servers and between clients
      and servers.</t>

      <t>Because AFS provides for authenticated access to data, it is
      necessary to map authentication entities, generally corresponding
      to users of the AFS file service ('users') or services requiring
      access to data via the AFS file service ('services'), collectively
      clients of the AFS file service ('clients'), to AFS authentication
      identifiers ('AFS IDs'). The PTS service is used to provide this
      service to the file server when required, typically when a client
      first contacts a file server with a new authentication context,
      including unauthenticated. AFS originally included a Kerberos
      authentication (KA) server implementing the Kerberos 4 protocol
      as well as the AFS-3 KA protocol for obtaining authentication
      information. Because of this, PTS authentication names take the
      format typically used to represent a Kerberos 4 authentication
      identity as a string, namely, principal name, followed by a dot
      and instance if there is an instance, followed by an at-sign and
      the cell name if the cell is not the local cell.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Error Codes">
      <t>AFS uses a library (com_err) and a tool from the MIT Project
      Athena suite (compile_et) to generate unique error codes
      protocol-wide. Codes are generated from a base value computed
      using a 4 or fewer character string known as an error table,
      identifying the subset of functionality which generated the
      error. All error codes are represented as signed 32 bit integers.
      The base value for PTS errors is 267264, generated from the
      error table name 'PT'. All RPCs when implemented are expected
      to return PTS errors. It is also possible for an implementation
      to support only part of this proposal. As such, any unimplemented
      RPCs should return error -455 (RXGEN_OPCODE), the error indicating
      an RPC is unsupported. No new errors are defined as part
      of this draft.</t>

      <t>The existing error code PRPERM shall be used for permission
      errors due to insufficient privilege when attempting any
      of the described RPCs.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Existing Protocol Constants">
      <t>When it is necessary to represent an identity which has
      provided either no authentication information, or information
      which does not include a corresponding AFS ID, an anonymous
      ID is defined and used.</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      #define      ANONYMOUSID     32766
      ]]></artwork></figure> 

      <t>The AFS ID 32766 shall be returned when an authentication
      name is unknown.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Existing Per-Identity Permission Flags">
      <t>The PTS service includes a basic security model based
      around defined access flags. The flags are represented as
      5 fields, each of which can have 3 values. One of these fields,
      the "s" field, is used to control who can get information
      about the entity. Valid values are 'S', which maps to PRP_STATUS_ANY,
      meaning anyone can get the information; 's', which maps to
      PRP_STATUS_MEM, meaning only members, the entity owner,
      and administrators can get the information; and '-' (or unset),
      meaning only the entity owner and administrators can get
      the information.</t>

    </section>
    <section anchor="rpcs_defined" title="RPC Interface">
      <t>Six new RPCs are defined for the AFS PTS service. Five of these
      are used to manipulate data related to authentication names, while
      the sixth is a general-purpose RPC to be used for capabilities
      indication. Additionally, several new data types are defined to
      allow representation of authentication names and identifiers in
      these new RPCs.</t>

    <section title="New Data Types">
      <t>In order to represent a set of AFS IDs, the nidlist type
      is defined. AFS IDs are expected to be enhanced to allow
      a larger set of IDs concurrently with this advancement of
      this proposal.</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      typedef afs_int64 nidlist<>;
      ]]></artwork></figure> 
      <t>A list of AFS IDs, represented as 64 bit integers.</t>

      <t>Authentication names are expected to be mechanism-specific.
      Thus an authentication-type agnostic data structure must
      be provided to represent these names. An implementing server
      MUST be able to use a bitwise comparison operation on
      the data portion of a PrAuthName. Support for all available
      name types is not expected.</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      #define AUTHDATAMAX 2048 
      #define AUTHPRINTABLEMAX 2048 
      struct PrAuthName { 
        afs_int32 kind; 
        opaque data<AUTHDATAMAX>; 
        opaque display<AUTHPRINTABLEMAX>; };
      ]]></artwork></figure> 

      <t>It is expected that some mechanisms will provide name data which is
      not human-readable, or is any single format is sufficient to represent
      all possible mechanism authentication names. Therefore the PrAuthName
      data structure includes an integer tag denoting type, and an opaque data
      object representing the mechanism-specific authentication name data.
      The display portion is to be used for display to end-users, and MUST NOT
      be used for comparison purposes. If a display portion is not provided,
      the data portion MUST NOT be used directly for user display
      purposes. A client with knowledge of the particular name type
      used MAY use the data portion to derive a suitable display name,
      if none is provided.</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      typedef struct PrAuthName authnamelist<>;
      ]]></artwork></figure> 

      <t>Each AFS ID is expected to have more than one name mapped to it,
      possibly with more than one name of each type assigned to each.
      It is therefore necessary to support a list of PrAuthNames.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Authentication Name Types">
      <t>The PrAuthName data type includes a 32 bit integer field
      to represent the kind of authentication being mapped. It
      is proposed that in addition to mappings for legacy Kerberos
      4 based AFS names, that the first version of this additionally
      include mappings for Kerberos 5-based and GSSAPI-based authentication
      names.</t>

      ]]></artwork></figure> 

    </section>
    <section title="GetCapabilities RPC">
      <t>As with other AFS services, the PTS service could be enhanced
      with the ability to represent new abilities to file servers
      and clients. We propose a new general-purpose RPC of the
      type implemented by other AFS services, namely, a bit stream.
      It is proposed that the first 32 bits be allocated to capabilities
      flags, while the remainder be reserved for future standardisation.</t>
      <t>A complying server MUST implement GetCapabilities.</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      const PTSCAPABILITIESMAX = 196;
      typedef afs_uint32 PrCapabilities<PTSCAPABILITIESMAX>;

      const PTS_CAPABILITY_AUTHNAMEMAPPING       = XXX;

      GetCapabilities(
      PrCapabilities *prcapabilities
      ) multi = XXX;
      ]]></artwork></figure> 

      <t>An implementing server should return 
      any capabilities data it wishes to advertise. A server may
      choose to not advertise the same capabilities to all callers;
      For instance, the set of capabilities advertised to an authenticated
      caller may be different than the set advertised to an anonymous
      caller. In addition to the bitstream, return value is 0 for
      success, or a PTS error in the event of error.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Authentication name mapping RPCs">
      <t>In addition to the general-purpose (GetCapabilities) RPC 
      needed to represent this extended functionality, a complying
      server will include RPCs to represent the mapping of extended
      names to AFS IDs.</t>

    <section title="AuthNameToID">
      <t>A complying server MUST implement the AuthNameToID RPC.
      This RPC is used to convert one or more authentication names,
      obtained by a file server or client in a mechanism-specific
      manner, to AFS IDs.</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      AuthNameToID(IN authnamelist *alist,
                   OUT nidlist *ilist) = XXX;
      ]]></artwork></figure> 

      <t>For each authname provided in alist, an AFS ID will be
      provided in ilist at the corresponding position. Where an
      authentication name cannot be looked up, the AFS ID in list
      will be ANONYMOUSID.</t>

      <t>On success of the call, 0 shall be returned. Success includes
      calls where none of the identities provided in authnamelist
      can be mapped to AFS IDs.</t>

      <t>A client being used to manipulate mappings SHOULD use this RPC to
      discover the existing mapping, if any, for a given authentication
      name.  A caller using the mapping service for service operation
      SHOULD instead call AuthNameToIDFallback.
      </t>
    </section>
        <section title="AuthNameToIDFallback">
      <t>A complying server MUST implement the AuthNameToIDFallback RPC.
      This RPC is used to convert one or more authentication names,
      obtained by a file server or client in a mechanism-specific
      manner, to AFS IDs to be used in making authorization decisions
      related to the named authentication identities.</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      AuthNameToIDFallback(IN authnamelist *alist,
                   OUT nidlist *ilist) = XXX;
      ]]></artwork></figure> 

      <t>For each authname provided in alist, an AFS ID will be
      provided in ilist at the corresponding position. Implicit
      fallback mappings will be used to map identities where no explicit
      mapping is provided. Where neither an explicit nor implicit mapping
      is available, the AFS ID in ilist will be ANONYMOUSID.</t>

      <t>On success of the call, 0 shall be returned. Success includes
      calls where none of the identities provided in authnamelist
      can be mapped to AFS IDs.</t>

      <t>A caller using the mapping service for service operation SHOULD
      use this RPC. A client being used to manipulate
      mappings SHOULD use AuthNameToID instead.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="ListAuthNames">
      <t>A complying server SHOULD implement the ListAuthNames RPC.
      This RPC is used to list all authentication names attached
      to the provided AFS ID.</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      ListAuthNames(IN afs_int64 id, OUT authnamelist *alist) = XXX;

      <t>On success, 0 shall be returned, along with the list of
      authentication names in alist corresponding to the AFS ID
      provided in id.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="WhoAmI">
      <t>A complying server SHOULD implement the WhoAmI RPC.
      This RPC is used to return the current authentication
      name and AFS ID for a caller to the caller.</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      WhoAmI(OUT afs_int64 id, OUT struct PrAuthName *alist) = XXX;

      authentication name corresponding to the caller of the RPC.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="AddAuthName">
      <t>A complying server MAY implement the AddAuthName RPC.
      This RPC is used to add an authentication name to an existing
      AFS ID.</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      AddAuthName(IN afs_int64 id, IN PrAuthName *aname) = XXX;

      <t>On success, 0 shall be returned. If the authentication
      name provided is already mapped to another AFS ID, PREXIST
      shall be returned. If the AFS ID specified does not exist,
      PRNOENT shall be returned.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="RemoveAuthName">
      <t>A complying server MAY implement the RemoveAuthName RPC.
      This RPC is used to remove an authentication name from an
      existing AFS ID.</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      RemoveAuthName(IN PrAuthName *aname) = XXX;
      ]]></artwork></figure>

    <section anchor="recommended_usage" title="Recommended Usage">
      <t>Two classes of service providers are possible. In one, where
      data is provided in a read-only fashion from an alternate
      authorization service, only the AuthNameToID and ListAuthNames
      RPCs are required. In the other, all RPCs are needed, such that
      mappings can be constructed and maintained.</t>

      <t>The ListAuthNames operation should be permitted for administrators
      as well as for the owner of the entry to be listed. If the
      'S' (PRP_STATUS_ANY) bit is set on the entry, then other
      users may also perform this operation.</t>

      <t>The AddAuthName and RemoveAuthName operations should always be
      permitted for administrators, and should normally also be
      permitted for the owner of the entry to be updated. For RemoveAuthName,
      the entry being updated is always the one to which the specified
      name currently maps, and should be an identity which is not the one
      being removed. Regardless, any given authentication name can map only
      to one ID; attempting to add (via AddAuthName) a second mapping for
      the same authentication name must fail.</t>

      <t>The AuthNameToID operation is analogous to the existing
      NameToID operation, and like that, should be able to be used
      by anyone.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Compatibility">
      <t>An implementation of the AFS protection service protocol
      implementing these extensions shall indicate this by including

    </section>
    <section title="Authentication Name Types">
      <t>While the authentication name is an opaque type with respect
      to the AFS-3 protocol, it is recommended that the following
      definitions be used for the proposed types described herein.</t>
      
    <section title="Kerberos V4">
      <t>The format of the Kerberos V4 name type is either name@REALM
      or name.inst@REALM, depending on whether a non-null instance
      is present. In both cases the trailing NUL character is *not*
      part of the authentication name data.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="GSSAPI Export Names">
      <t>The format of the GSSAPI name type is that described in
      section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC2743"></xref>.
      The data opaque object will contain the GSSAPI canonical
      name as generated by GSS_Export_name after GSS_Canonicalize_name.
      The display opaque object will contain the GSSAPI display name type
      and name string as generated by GSS_Display_name. The display name
      MUST only be used for printing; the canonical name must not be used
      for printing.</t>

    <section title="Authentication Name Type Rewriting">
    <section title="Kerberos 4 Name Rewriting">
       <t>When Kerberos 4 is used, the Kerberos name type must be used.
       In particular, Kerberos 4 principal names MUST NOT be represented
       as Kerberos 5 names or vice versa.
       </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Kerberos 5 Name Rewriting">
       <t>When Kerberos 5 is used, with or without the GSSAPI, Kerberos 5 principal
       names MUST be represented using the GSSAPI export name type with the

       MUST convert to a GSSAPI Kerberos 5 export name using the Kerberos mechanism OID
       before calling AuthNameToID. This is intended to allow all users of Kerberos
       5 as an authentication mechanism, regardless of bindings, to use the same
       authentication name.

       Implementations which do not support GSSAPI can support this by preparing
       a name as specified in section 2.1.1 of <xref target="RFC1964"></xref>,
       subject to the constraints in section 2.1.3. This string, when prefixed

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Allowing AuthNameToID to be used by any caller exposes information

      <t>Because a server is not required to know about all available name types,
      display names are provided by the caller to AddAuthName. It is possible
      to provide an erroneous display name whether for malicious or benign
