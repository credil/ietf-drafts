    <abstract>
	<t>
	This document describes a mechanism to model a broadcast network as a
	hybrid of broadcast and point-to-multipoint networks for purposes of
	OSPF operation.  Neighbor discovery and maintenance as well as LSA
	database synchronization are performed using the broadcast model, but
	the network is represented using the point-to-multipoint model in the
	router LSAs of the routers connected to it.  This allows an accurate
	representation of the cost of communication between different routers
	on the network, while maintaining the network efficiency of broadcast
	operation.  This approach is relatively simple and requires minimal
	changes to OSPF.

<section title="Introduction" anchor='intro'>
    <t>
    OSPF <xref target='RFC2328'/> operation on broadcast interfaces takes
    advantage of the broadcast capabilities of the underlying medium for
    doing neighbor discovery and maintenance.  Further, it uses a Designated
    Router and Backup Designated Router to keep the LSA databases of the
    routers on the network synchronized in an efficient manner.  However, it
    has the limitation that a router cannot advertise different costs to
    each of the neighboring routers on the network in it's router LSA.
    </t>

    <t>
    Operation on point-to-multipoint interfaces could require explicit
    configuration of the identity of it's neighboring routers.  It also
    requires the router to send separate hellos to each neighbor on the
    network.  Further, it mandates establishment of adjacencies to all
    all configured or discovered neighbors on the network.  However, it
    gives the routers the flexibility to advertise different costs to
    each of the neighboring routers in their router LSAs.
    </t>

    <t>
    This document proposes a new interface type that can be used on layer
    2 networks that have broadcast capability.  In this mode, neighbor
    discovery and maintenance, as well as database synchronization are
    performed using existing procedures for broadcast mode.  The network
    is modeled as a collection of point-to-point links in the router LSA,
    just as it would be in point-to-multipoint mode.  This new interface
    type is referred to as hybrid-broadcast-and-p2mp in the rest of this
    document.
    </t>

</section>

<section title="Motivation" anchor='motivation'>
    <t>
    There are some layer 2 networks that are broadcast capable but have a
    potentially different cost associated with communication between any
    given pair of nodes.  The cost could be based on the underlying layer
    2 topology as well as various link quality metrics such as bandwidth,
    delay and jitter among others.
    </t>

    <t>
    It is not accurate to treat such networks as OSPF broadcast networks
    since that does not allow a router to advertise a different cost to
    each of the other routers.  Using OSPF point-to-multipoint mode would
    satisfy the requirement to correctly describe the cost to reach each
    router.  However, it would be inefficient in the sense that it would
    require forming O(N^2) adjacencies when there are N routers on the
    network.
    </t>

    <t>
    It is advantageous to use the hybrid-broadcast-and-p2mp type for such
    networks.  This combines the flexibility of point-to-multipoint type
    with the advantages and efficiencies of broadcast interface type.
    </t>
</section>

<section title="Operation" anchor='sec-operation'>
    
    <t>
    OSPF routers supporting the capabilities described herein should have
    support for an additional hybrid-broadcast-and-p2mp type for the Type
    data item described in section 9 of <xref target='RFC2328'/>.
    </t>

    <t>
    The following sub-sections describe salient aspects of OSPF operation
    on routers configured with a hybrid-broadcast-and-p2mp interface.
    </t>

    <section title="Interface Parameters" anchor='sec-intf-params'>

	<t>
	Routers MUST support configuration of the Router Priority for the
	interface.
	</t>

	<t>
	The default value of the LinkLSASuppression is "disabled".  It MAY
	be set to "enabled" via configuration.
	</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Neighbor Data Structure" anchor='sec-nbr-data-struct'>

	<t>
	Routers MUST support an additional field called the Neighbor Output
	Cost.  This is the cost of sending a data packet to the neighbor,
	expressed in the link state metric.  The default value of this field
	is the Interface output cost.  It MAY be set to a different value
	using mechanisms which are outside the scope of this document,
	like static per-neighbor configuration, or any dynamic discovery
	mechanism that is supported by the underlying network.
	</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Neighbor Discovery and Maintenance"
	     anchor='sec-nbr-disc'>

	<t>
	Routers send and receive Hellos so as to perform neighbor discovery
	and maintenance on the interface using the procedures specified for
	broadcast interfaces in <xref target='RFC2328'/> and
	<xref target='RFC5340'/>.
	</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Database Synchronization" anchor='sec-db-sync'>

	<t>
	Routers elect a DR and BDR for the interface and use them for initial
	and ongoing database synchronization using the procedures specified
	for broadcast interfaces in <xref target='RFC2328'/> and
	<xref target='RFC5340'/>.
	</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Generating Network LSAs" anchor='sec-network-lsa'>

	<t>
	Since a hybrid-broadcast-and-p2mp interface is described in router
	LSAs using a collection of point-to-point links, the DR SHOULD NOT
	generate a network LSA for the interface.
	</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Generating Router and Intra-Area-Prefix-LSAs"
	     anchor='sec-router-lsa'>

	<t>
	Routers describe the interface in their router LSA as specified for
	a point-to-multipoint interface in section 12.4.1.4 of
	<xref target='RFC2328'/> and section 4.4.3.2 of
	<xref target='RFC5340'/>, with the following modifications for Type
	1 links:

	<list style='symbols'>

	    <t>
	    If a router is not the DR, it MUST NOT add any Type 1 links if it
	    does not have a full adjacency to the DR.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	    If a router is not the DR and has a full adjacency to the DR, it
	    MUST add a Type 1 link corresponding to each neighbor that is in
	    state 2-Way or higher.
	    </t>
   
	    <t>
	    The cost for a Type 1 link corresponding to a neighbor SHOULD be
	    set to the value of the Neighbor Output Cost field as defined in
	    <xref target='sec-nbr-data-struct'/>
	    </t>

	</list>

	</t>

	<section title="Stub Links in OSPFv2 Router LSA"
		 anchor='sec-stub-links'>
	    <t>
	    Routers MUST add a Type 3 link for their own IP address to the
	    router LSA as described in section 12.4.1.4 of
	    <xref target='RFC2328'/>.  Further, they MUST also add a Type 3
	    link with the Link ID set to the IP subnet address, Link Data set
	    to the IP subnet mask, and cost equal to the configured output
	    cost of the interface.
	    </t>
	</section>

	<section title="OSPFv3 Intra-Area-Prefix-LSA"
		 anchor='sec-intra-ap-lsa'>

	    <t>
	    Routers MUST add global scoped IPv6 addresses on the interface to
	    the intra-area-prefix-LSA as described for point-to-multipoint
	    interfaces in section 4.4.3.9 of <xref target='RFC5340'/>.  In
	    addition, they MUST also add all global scoped IPv6 prefixes on
	    the interface to the LSA by specifying the PrefixLength,
	    PrefixOptions, and Address Prefix fields.  The Metric field for
	    each of these prefixes is set to the configured output cost of
	    the interface.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	    The DR SHOULD NOT generate an intra-area-prefix-LSA for the transit
	    network for this interface since it does not generate a network LSA
	    for the interface.  Note that the global prefixes associated with
	    the interface are advertised in the intra-area-prefix-LSA for the
	    router as described above.
	    </t>

	</section>

    </section>

    <section title="Next-Hop Calculation" anchor='sec-next-hop'>

	<t>
	Next-Hops to destinations that are directly connected to a router via
	the interface are calculated as specified for a point-to-multipoint
	interface in section 16.1.1 of <xref target='RFC2328'/>.
	</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Graceful Restart" anchor='sec-restart'>

	<t>
	The following modifications to the procedures defined in section 2.2,
	item 1 of <xref target='RFC3623'/> are required in order to ensure
	that the router correctly exits graceful restart.

	<list style='symbols'>

	    <t>
	    If a router is the DR on the interface, it MUST NOT examine the
	    pre-restart network LSA for the interface in order to determine
	    the previous set of adjacencies.
	    </t>

	    <t>
	    If a router is in state DROther on the interface, it MUST consider
	    an adjacency to non-DR and non-BDR neighbors as reestablished when
	    the neighbor state reaches 2-Way.
	    </t>

	</list>

	</t>

    </section>

</section>

<section title="Compatibility Considerations" anchor='sec-compat'>

    <t>
    All routers on the network must support the hybrid-broadcast-and-p2mp
    interface type for successful operation.  Otherwise, the interface
    should be configured as a standard broadcast interface.
    </t>

    <t>
    If some routers on the network treat the interface as broadcast and
    others as hybrid-broadcast-and-p2mp, neighbors and adjacencies will
    still get formed as for a broadcast interface.  However, due to the
    differences in how router and network LSAs are built for these two
    interface types, there will be no traffic traversing certain pairs
    of routers.  Note that this will not cause any persistent loops or
    black holing of traffic.
    </t>

</section>

<section title="Scalability and Deployment Considerations"
	 anchor='sec-scalability'>

    <t>
    Treating a broadcast interface as hybrid-broadcast-and-p2mp results
    in O(N^2) links to represent the network instead of O(N), when there
    are N routers on the network.  This will increase memory usage and
    have a negative impact on route calculation performance on all the
    routers in the area.  Network designers should carefully weigh the
    benefits of using the new interface type against the disadvantages
    mentioned here.
    </t>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor='sec-security'>

    <t>
    This document raises no new security issues for OSPF.  Security
    considerations for the base OSPF protocol are covered in
    <xref target='RFC2328'/> and <xref target='RFC5340'/>.
    </t>

</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor='sec-iana'>

    <t>
    This document has no IANA considerations.
