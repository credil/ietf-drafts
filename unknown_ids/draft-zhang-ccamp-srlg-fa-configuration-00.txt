1. Introduction 

   An LSP is advertised as a Traffic Engineering (TE) link by a 
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) node that created the LSP, which is referred 
   to as the "forwarding adjacency LSP", or FA-LSP. Such a link is a 
   "forwarding adjacency" (FA). [RFC 4206] describes the signaling and 
   routing aspects of the FA-LSP.  

   [RFC 3477] describes how to create an unnumbered FA and advertise it 
   as an unnumbered TE link automatically. [LSP-Hierarchy-bis] defines 
   the extensions to RSVP-TE to cover other FA advertising scenarios, 
   e.g. signaling of numbered FAs, Signaling an LSP for Use in a Link 
   Bundle and Signaling an LSP For use in Another Network.  

   In order to advertise the FAs automatically, the attributes of the FA 
   need to be configured automatically after the setup of the FAs. The 
   following attributes are described in [RFC 4206]: 

   o Link Type (OSPF Only, point-to-point) 

   o Link ID (OSPF Only, the Router ID of the remote-end of FA-LSP)  

   o Local and Remote Interface IP Address  

   o Local and Remote Link Identifiers 

   o Traffic Engineering Metric

   o Maximum Bandwidth  

   o Unreserved Bandwidth  

   o Resource Class/Color  

   o Interface Switching Capability  

   o SRLG Information 

   [RFC 4206] describes how to set the TE metric, maximum bandwidth, 
   unreserved bandwidth, resource class and interface switching 
   capability. [LSP-Hierarchy-bis] updates [RFC 4206] to provide 
   solutions on how to create H-LSP and advertise FA.  

   As described in Section 3.1.10 of [RFC 4206], an FA advertisement 
   could contain the information about the Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLG) 
   for the path taken by the FA-LSP associated with that FA. This 
   information may be used for SRLG disjoint path computation by other 
   LSRs. The SRLG information of the FA is the union of the SRLGs of the 
   TE links and nodes that make up the FA-LSP path.  

   In the client/server networks, the detailed path information that 
   passes through the server network is usually not provided to end 
   points of the FA in the client layer because of confidential 
   consideration. In addition, for the client/server networks, usually 
   they have separate routing instance, so the end points of the FA can 
   not get the SRLG information of FA-LSP.  

   Therefore, the SRLG information of the FA needs to be configured 
   manually by operator when advertising the FA. However, for manually 
   configuration, there are some disadvantages mentioned in Section 
   1.3.4 of [LSP-Hierarchy-bis].  

   In addition, Section 1.2 of [LSP-Hierarchy-bis] describes it is 
   desirable to have a kind of automatic mechanism to advertise the FA 
   (i.e., to signal an LSP and automatically coordinate its use and 
   advertisement in any of the ways with minimum involvement from an 
   operator).  

   Therefore, in order to make the FA advertisement completely 
   automatically, this document provides an automatic mechanism to 
   configure the SRLG of FA automatically.

2. RSVP-TE Requirements  

2.1. FA SRLG Indication 

   The head nodes of the FA-LSP must be capable of indicating whether 
   the SRLG information of the FA-LSP should be collected during the 
   signaling procedure of setting up an FA-LSP.  

2.2. FA SRLG Collecting  

   The SRLG information can be collected during the setup of an FA-LSP. 
   Then the endpoints of the FA-LSP can get the SRLG information and 
   configure it to the corresponding FA link automatically.  

2.3. FA SRLG Update 

   When the SRLG information changes, the endpoints of the FA-LSP need 
   to be capable of update the SRLG information of the corresponding FA 
   link. It means that the signaling needs to be capable of updating the 
   newly SRLG information to the endpoints.  

3. RSVP-TE Extensions 

3.1. FA SRLG Indication  

   The LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object defined in [LSP-Hierarchy-bis] is 
   extended by adding a new flag (S flag) to the Action field:  

            -+-+-+-+-+-+-+- 
           | | |S|H|B|R|T|P| 
            -+-+-+-+-+-+-+- 
    
   S-flag (SRLG indication) 

     0 means that the endpoints do not need the SRLG information.  

     1 means that the endpoints need the SRLG information.  

3.2. SRLG Information Object  

   An SRLG information is defined to carry the SRLG information of the 
   FA-LSP path. The Class-Num and the C-Type of the SRLG Information 
   Object need to be assigned by the IANA.

      //                   ......                                    // 
      |                 SRLG ID (4 bytes)                             | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   The SRLG ID list carries the SRLG information of the FA-LSP. This 
   object can be carried in a Path/Resv message. 

   The SRLG information can be added to the Path/Resv message hop by hop. 
   Then the endpoints of the FA-LSP can get the SRLG information of the 
   path.  

3.3. Signaling Procedures 

   When an FA head node determine that it needs to get the SRLG 
   information of the FA-LSP before setting up the FA-LSP, it sets the S 
   flag in the Action field of the LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object when 
   it sends the Path message to the downstream node. The downstream 
   nodes record the SRLG information in the SRLG Information Object hop 
   by hop. Then the tail node of the FA-LSP can get the SRLG information 
   from the RRO.  

   The tail node also needs to set the S flag in the Action field of the 
   LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object when it sends the Resv message to the 
   upstream node. The upstream nodes record the SRLG information in the 
   SRLG Information Object hop by hop. Then the head node of the FA-LSP 
   can get the SRLG information from the RRO.  

   Based on the above procedure, the endpoints can get the SRLG 
   information automatically. Then the endpoints can configure the SRLG 
   information of the FA and advertise it to the routing instance based 
   on the procedure described in [LSP-Hierarchy-bis].
