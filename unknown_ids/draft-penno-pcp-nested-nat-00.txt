                PCP Support for Nested NAT Environments
                     draft-penno-pcp-nested-nat-00

Abstract

   Nested NATs or multi-layer NATs are already widely deployed.  They
   are characterized by two or more NAT devices in the path of packets
   from the subscriber to the Internet.  Moreover, NAT devices current
   deployed are PCP unaware and It is assumed that NAT aware PCP devices
   will take a long time to be rolled out.  Therefore in order to lower
   the adoption barrier of PCP and make it work for current deployed
   networks, this draft proposes a few mechanisms for PCP enabled
   clients to work through nested NATs with varying level of PCP
   protocol support.

1.  Introduction

   Nested NATs are widely deployed and come in different topology
   flavors.  It could be a home subscriber which has an ISP provided NAT
   CPE chained with another personal NAT router.  It could be an ISP
   provided CPE chained with a CGN.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses PCP terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]].

1.2.  Problem Statement

   The current NAT deployed devices will take years to be replaced or
   upgraded to become PCP aware.  Moreover, nested NATs are common and
   come in a variety of flavors (examples below).  Therefore, as
   applications become PCP enabled, it is important that they can work
   through nested NAT networks as is, without requiring infrastructure
   changes.  From the point of view of a PCP enabled application running
   on an end host, the core problem is common across different nested
   NAT topologies: how to install PCP mappings in a nested NAT scenario
   where the different NATs in the path have varying level of PCP
   protocol support.

1.3.  Scope

   This proposal considers the discovery of the PCP Server out of scope.
   Nonetheless, it s a critical piece of PCP deployment in service
   provider networks.  This proposal is aimed at solving the nested NAT
   problem without PCP protocol extensions .


2.  PCP Nested NAT Methods

   There are a few methods to make PCP work through nested NATs.  They

   differ mainly based on the level of support that can be expected from
   intermediate NATs, which can be:

   o  PCP and UPnP unaware or disabled

   o  PCP Server

   o  UPnP Server

   o  PCP Proxy

   The next sections discuss each scenario on the basis of protocol
   support on intermediate NATs.

2.1.  NAT and UPnP unaware Intermediate NATs

   This method will most likely be used by PCP clients in nested NAT
   environments while PCP Proxy support in not ubiquitous.  It assumes
   no UPnP or PCP Proxy support on intermediate NATs.  This proposal
   leverages the current behavior of the PCP Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] which allows a PCP Client and Server to detect
   intervening nested NATs.  The PCP Server uses the information on the
   outer IP and PCP headers to detect and install a proper NAT mapping
   and return the source IP:port from the IP header on the PCP response.
   It does not assume any change to current deployed NATs.

   1.  The PCP Client sends the MAP request as it normally would without
       any changes.

   2.  As the message goes through one (or more) PCP-unaware NAT, the
       source IP:port of the IP header will change accordingly

   3.  The PCP Server compares the PCP Client IP:port in the PCP header
       with the source IP:port of the IP header

   4.  If these are different, the server knows that the PCP message
       went through a PCP-unaware NAT.  Therefore it installs a mapping
       directed to the source IP address found on the IP header and
       internal port of the PCP header.

2.2.  PCP Server intermediate NAT

   If the intermediate NAT implements a PCP Server (but not a Proxy), a
   two-step iterative process is needed in order to install PCP PEER
   mappings for the PCP control message itself followed by another PCP
   mapping for the data path. if client relies on nested NAT detection
   the first step is not needed.  It is assumed that before the PCP MAP
   request to the CGN the client would install the following map on the
   NAT Home Gateway: (192.168.0.2, 40000) <- (10.0.0.2, 40000).  The
   internal port that the server listens on does not necessarily needs
   to be 40000, it could be different than the internal port used
   between the CGN and HGW.

2.3.  UPnP enabled intermediate NAT

   This scenario is very similar to the PCP Server intermediate NAT, but
   the HGW implements a UPnP Server instead of PCP Server.  The
   mechanics are the same with the difference that first PEER message to
   setup the PCP Control messages mapping is substituted by its UPnP
   equivalent.

2.4.  PCP Proxy Intermediate NAT

   This method assumed that the intermediate NATs implement a PCP Proxy
   function.  There are two non-exclusive types of proxy functions:
   interception (ALG) and server based.  In the interception case the
   PCP Proxy intercepts PCP messages destined to a PCP Server
   downstream, modifies IP, UDP and PCP headers, allocates a mapping and
   send them to the downstream PCP Server.  Ideally if the interception
   PCP Proxy also implements a PCP server it would let the PCP Client
   know of its existence in a PCP response and henceforth the PCP Client
   would start directing messages to it.

   In the server based proxy the PCP Client directs the PCP messages to
   the proxy which acts as a PCP Server and Client.  More information
   about this method can be found in [I-D.bpw-pcp-proxy].
