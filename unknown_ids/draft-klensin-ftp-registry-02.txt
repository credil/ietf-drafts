Internet-Draft           FTP Extension Registry             October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Every version of the FTP specification has added a few new commands,
   with the early ones summarized in RFC 959 [RFC0959].  RFC 2389
   [RFC2389] established a mechanism for specifying and negotiating
   extensions to the FTP protocol specified in RFC 959 [RFC0959], by
   means of "FEAT Strings" identifying extensions supported by the FTP
   server, and sent in response to a "FEAT" command.  As the number of
   those extensions increases, it appears useful to establish an IANA
   registry to reduce the likelihood of conflict of names and the
   consequent ambiguity.  This specification establishes that registry.

1.1.  Discussion List

   [[ RFC Editor: please remove this section before publication. ]]

   Until and unless a WG is created, this proposal will be discussed on
   the list apps-discuss@ietf.org


2.  Registry Definition

2.1.  Registry Name

   The recommended name of this registry is "FTP Extensions".

2.2.  Registry Format

   IANA is requested to establish a registry for FTP commands and
   extensions whose entries should include the following:

   Command Name -  The FTP command, either new or modified, used in the
      extension or with which the extension is used.  Following the
      long-standing practice to capitalize command names in
      specification documents for FTP, the command names are entered in
      all uppercase.  For extensions amending the operation of a
      command, a plus sign ("+") is appended to the command name.
      However, an extension might not be bound to one command (or a
      small number of commands), but affect the overall command
      parameter handling and/or transaction processing; in this case,
      the string "-N/A-" is entered.

      It is intended to have the registry entries ordered by ascending
      ASCII collation order.

Internet-Draft           FTP Extension Registry             October 2009


   Extension name -  The name of the extension.  FTP extensions
      predating [RFC2389], and some extensions published after it as
      well, did not specify a keyword to identify the extension in a
      FEAT response.  Some other specifications later have established
      FEAT strings with the respective command names as their keywords.
      In order to reserve keywords for future specifications in such
      cases, this document establishes 'placeholder' keywords to reserve
      reasonable feature names for future standardization.  To
      accommodate for this idiosyncrasy, the column in the registry is
      entitled "FEAT Code", and to clearly distinguish between the two
      cases, defined FEAT keywords codes are listed in all uppercase,
      whereas 'placeholder' keywords are listed in lowercase.  Future
      specifications are allowed to "upgrade" a placeholder to a true
      keyword, but otherwise IANA maintains uniqueness of feature names
      (FEAT codes) based on case-insensitive comparison.

   Description -  A brief description of the extension and, where
      appropriate, the command.

   FEAT String -  (optional in registration requests to the IANA) The
      string expected to be included in the response to the FEAT command
      (see RFC 2389 [RFC2389]) if the extension is supported.
      In many cases, the FEAT string required to identify an extension
      only consists of the "FEAT Code", making this item redundant.
      Therefore, this item should only be specified if it is intended to
      register a FEAT string that contains more mandatory elements than
      the mere "FEAT Code".
      Due to space restrictions, and to allow registrants to provide
      additional information as well, IANA should present these
      registration items (if given) in numbered footnotes to the table,
      not in an additional table column.

   Command Type -  The type (or 'kind') of the command.  Section 4.1 of
      RFC 959 [RFC0959] has introduced a subdivision of FTP commands
      into three types: Access control, transfer Parameter {setting},
      and Service {execution}.  For clarity and as a service to the user
      of the registry, this subdivision is extended to all registered
      FTP commands, using the characteristic initial of the type, 'a',
      'p', or 's', respectively, filed in the registry column entitled
      "type"; combinations are allowed, e.g. 'p/s'

   Conformance Requirements -  The support expectation for the command.
      [RFC0959] specifies mandatory-to-implement commands and optional
      commands.  This classification is carried over to all registered
      commands, using a column entitled "conf" carrying a single
      character -- either 'm' or 'o', for "mandatory" and "optional",
      respectively.  Beyond the initial registrations, Standards Action
      [RFC5226] is needed to register new "mandatory" entries.

Internet-Draft           FTP Extension Registry             October 2009


   Reference -  A reference to an RFC or other definition of the
      extension and/or to implementations supporting it (see the next
      section).

2.3.  Criteria for Registration

   This registry is primarily intended to avoid conflicting uses of the
   same extension names and command keywords for different purposes, not
   to demonstrate that an extension is somehow "approved".  The "expert
   review" method will be used, but the designated expert is expected to
   check only that one of the two criteria that follow are met.

   1.  The extension is described in an RFC or other generally-available
       publication for which the fact of publication indicates some
       level of peer review of document quality.

   2.  The extension is actually implemented in FTP client and server
       systems that are generally available (not necessarily either free
       or unencumbered, but available) and those systems are identified
       as part of the documentation requirement above.

   For an extension or command to be marked "mandatory" ('m' in the
   "conf" column), an IETF Standards Track Specification is required.
   An IESG Standards Action is allowed to direct IANA to change the
   Conformance Requirements listed for any entry.

2.4.  Base FTP Commands Not Listed in Registry

   The following commands are part of the base FTP specification
   [RFC0959] and hence are not listed in the registry.

      Mandatory commands:

      ABOR, ACCT, ALLO, APPE, CWD, DELE, HELP, LIST, MODE, NLST, NOOP,
      PASS, PASV, PORT, QUIT, REIN, REST, RETR, RNFR, RNTO, SITE, STAT,
      STOR, STRU, TYPE, USER

      Optional commands:

      CDUP, MKD, PWD, RMD, SMNT, STOU, SYST

   Note: STD 3 [RFC1123] contains important complementary information
   for the following commands:

      LIST, NLST, PASV, REST, SITE, STOU

Internet-Draft           FTP Extension Registry             October 2009


2.5.  Obsolete Commands not Listed

   The following commands were specified as experimental in [RFC0775]
   but later deprecated by [RFC1123] and are hence not listed, because
   [RFC0959] specifies their standard successors.

      XCUP, XCWD, XMKD, XPWD, XRMD

   The following commands were specified as part of the "FOOBAR" IPng
   effort in [RFC1545][RFC1639] and are now obsolete.

      LPRT, LPSV


3.  Initial Contents of Registry

   As a service to users of the registry and the authors of existing
   specifications, all FTP commands and features published in RFCs after
   STD 3 [RFC1123] and up at the time of this writing are included into
   the registry upon creation.

   The following pseudo FEAT codes have been assigned, according to
   Section 2:

      secu - FTP Security Extensions [RFC2228]

      feat - FTP Feature Negotiation [RFC2389]

      nat6 - FTP Ext'ns for NAT/IPv6 [RFC2428]

   Using conservative judgment of implementation requirements as
   contemporarily seen, the extensions specified in [RFC2389] and
   [RFC2428] have been marke "mandatory" below: without RFC 2389
   [RFC2389], feature negotiation is impossible, and RFC 2428 [RFC2428]
   specifies commands that are essential for FTP operation in many parts
   the of the current Internet, in the presence of middleboxes and
   firewalls, and for FTP transport over IPv6.

4.  Acknowledgments

   Any work to update or extend FTP depends on the base specification in
   RFC 959.  The contributions of its editors, Jon Postel and Joyce
   Reynolds, are gratefully acknowledged.  The option negotiation
   mechanism specified in RFC 2389 and the accumulation of features that
   has followed it made this registry relevant; the authors of those
   documents are acknowledged as well.

   Barry Leiba and Alexey Melnikov made several suggestions about
   earlier drafts of this document, most of which have been
   incorporated.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to establish the registry described in Section 2.

   New entries should be added to this registry when extensions to FTP
   are approved or defined in published RFCs or when extensions that are
   already in use and well-documented are identified.  In other words,
   the requirement for registration is "Specifications Required"
   [RFC5226] with Expert Review.  See Section 2.3 for specifics and one
   exception.


6.  Security Considerations

   The creation of this registry provides improved documentation and
