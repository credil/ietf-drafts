             IPv6 Support Required for all IP-capable nodes
                  draft-ietf-intarea-ipv6-required-01

Abstract

   Given the global lack of available IPv4 space, and limitations in
   IPv4 extension and transition technologies, this document deprecates
   the concept that an IP-capable node MAY support IPv4 _only_, and
   redefines an IP-capable node as one which supports either IPv6 _only_
   or IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack.  This document updates RFC1812, RFC1122 and
   RFC4084 to reflect the change in requirements.

Internet-Draft                IPv6-required                    July 2011


1.  Introduction

   IP version 4 (IPv4) has served to connect public and private hosts
   all over the world for over 30 years.  However, due to the success of
   the Internet in finding new and innovative uses for IP networking,
   billions of hosts are now connected via the Internet and requiring
   unique addressing.  This demand has led to the exhaustion of the IANA
   global pool of unique IPv4 addresses [IANA-exhaust], and will be
   followed by the exhaustion of the free pools for each Regional
   Internet Registry (RIR), the first of which is APNIC [APNIC-exhaust].
   While transition technologies and other means to extend the lifespan
   of IPv4 do exist, nearly all of them come with tradeoffs that prevent
   them from being optimal long-term solutions when compared with
   deployment of IP version 6 (IPv6) as a means to allow continued
   growth on the Internet.  See
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues] and
   [I-D.donley-nat444-impacts] for some discussion on this topic.

   IPv6 [RFC1883] was proposed in 1995 as, among other things, a
   solution to the limitations on globally unique addressing that IPv4's
   32-bit addressing space represented, and has been under continuous
   refinement and deployment ever since.  [RFC2460].  The exhaustion of
   IPv4 and the continued growth of the internet worldwide has created
   the driver for widespread IPv6 deployment.

   However, the IPv6 deployment necessary to reduce reliance on IPv4 has
   been hampered by a lack of ubiquitous hardware and software support
   throughout the industry.  Many vendors, especially in the consumer
   space have continued to view IPv6 support as optional.  Even today
   they are still selling "IP capable" or "Internet Capable" devices
   which are not IPv6-capable, which has continued to push out the point
   at which the natural hardware refresh cycle will significantly
   increase IPv6 support in the average home or enterprise network.
   They are also choosing not to update existing software to enable IPv6
   support on software-updatable devices, which is a problem because it
   is not realistic to expect that the hardware refresh cycle will
   single-handedly purge IPv4-only devices from the active network in a
   reasonable amount of time.  This is a significant problem, especially
   in the consumer space, where the network operator often has no
   control over the hardware the consumer chooses to use.  For the same
   reason that the average consumer is not making a purchasing decision
   based on the presence of IPv6 support in their Internet-capable
   devices and services, consumers are unlikely to replace their still-
   functional Internet-capable devices simply to add IPv6 support - they
   don't know or don't care about IPv6, they simply want their devices
   to work as advertised.

   This lack of support is making the eventual IPv6 transition

   considerably more difficult, and drives the need for expensive and
   complicated transition technologies to extend the life of IPv4-only
   devices as well as eventually to interwork IPv4-only and IPv6-only
   hosts.  While IPv4 is expected to coexist on the Internet with IPv6
   for many years, a transition from IPv4 as the dominant Internet
   Protocol towards IPv6 as the dominant Internet Protocol will need to
   occur.  The sooner the majority of devices support IPv6, the less
   protracted this transition period will be.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Requirements and Recommendation

   This draft updates the following documents:

   Updates [RFC1812], especially sections 1, 2, and 4 which use the
   generic "IP" synonymously with the more specific "IPv4."  Since
   RFC1812 is an IPv4 router specification, the generic use of IP in
   this standard may cause confusion as IP is redefined to mean IPv4 +
   IPv6.  This proposed update is not intended to change the existing
   technical interpretation of RFC1812 to include IPv6 in its
   implementation details.  Rather, it is intended to ensure that those
   using RFC1812 as a guideline for IP implementations understand that
   IP nodes SHOULD NOT support IPv4 only, and that they should use the
   other informative references in this document as a companion
   guideline for proper IPv6 implementations.

   Updates [RFC1122] to clarify that this document, especially in
   section 3, primarily discusses IPv4 where it uses the more generic
   term "IP" and is no longer a complete definition of "IP" or the
   Internet Protocol suite by itself.  For example, section 3.1 does not
   contain references to the IPv6 equivalent standards for the Internet
   layer, section 3.2 is a protocol walk-through for IPv4 only; section
   3.2.1.1 explicitly requires an IP datagram whose version number is
   not 4 to be discarded, which would be detrimental to IPv6 forwarding.
   However, portions of RFC1122 refer to the Internet Layer and IP more
   in terms of its function and are less version-specific, such as
   Section 1.1.3.  In these cases, it is possible to redefine generic
   "IP" support to include and require IPv6 for IP-capable nodes and
   routers.

   Updates [RFC4084] to move "Version Support" from Section 4,
   "Additional Terminology" to Section 2, "General Terminology."  This

Internet-Draft                IPv6-required                    July 2011


   is to reflect the idea that version support is now critical to
   defining the types of IP service, especially with respect to Full
   Internet Connectivity.

   Rather than update the existing IPv4 protocol specification standards
   to include IPv6, IETF has defined a completely separate set of
   standalone documents which cover IPv6.  Therefore, the above-listed
   standards are not being updated to include the complete technical
   details of IPv6, but to identify that a distinction must be made
   between IPv4 and IPv6 in some places where IP is used generically.
   Current requirements for IPv6 support can be found in [RFC4294], soon
   to be updated by [I-D.ietf-6man-node-req-bis] and in [RFC6204].  Each
   of these documents contains specific information, requirements, and
   references to other draft and proposed standards governing many
   aspects of IPv6 implementation.

   From a practical perspective, the requirements proposed by this draft
   mean that:

      New IP implementations MUST support IPv6.

      Current IP implementations SHOULD support IPv6.

      IPv6 support MUST be equivalent or better in quality and
      functionality when compared to IPv4 support in an IP
      implementation.

      Current and new IP Networking implementations SHOULD support IPv4
      and IPv6 coexistence (dual-stack), but MUST NOT require IPv4 for
      proper and complete function.

      It is expected that many existing devices and implementations will
      not be able to support IPv6 for one or more valid technical
      reasons, but for maximum flexibility and compatibility, a best
      effort SHOULD be made to update existing hardware and software to
      enable IPv6 support.

   There are no direct security considerations generated by this
   document, but existing documented security considerations for
   implementing IPv6 will apply.
