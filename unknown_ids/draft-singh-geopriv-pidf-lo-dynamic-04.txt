Internet-Draft    Dynamic Feature Extensions to PIDF-LO     October 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Presence Information Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO) (see
   RFC 4119 [RFC4119]) provides geographical location of the presentity.
   This corresponds to a physical location at a given instance of time.
   The PIDF-LO specification made a subset of the functionality offered
   by the Geography Markup Language (GML) standard 3.0 mandatory to
   implement.  With the extensions defined in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile] more guidelines to implementers
   are being provided with respect to a number of location shapes that
   have to be supported for usage within PIDF-LO.  However, a number of
   applications benefit from having access to information about changes
   in location.  Location change information is likely to be useful for
   logistics and public safety.  For example, shipping companies or
   dispatch centers can use it to track whether vehicles are deviating
   from an established path or exceeding speed limits.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  XML Extensions

   This document defines a location vector by adding child elements to
   the <location-info> element described in RFC 4119 [RFC4119], to carry
   temporal feature elements.  A receiver MAY ignore the temporal
   elements defined in this document if it does not understand this
   extension.

   speed:

      Speed is the rate of motion.  (The terms speed and velocity are
      often used interchangeably, but speed is a scalar, having
      magnitude only, while velocity is a vector, having both magnitude
      and direction.)

      This element contains a 'uom' (Units Of Measure) attribute, which
      is a reference to a reference system for the amount.  The 'uom'
      attribute uses a URI to refer to a unit of measure definition.
      The GML document defines a set of convenience measure types and a
      further explaination is provided at the end of this section.

Internet-Draft    Dynamic Feature Extensions to PIDF-LO     October 2008


   bearing:

      Bearing is defined as the horizontal direction of one terrestrial
      point from another, expressed as the angular distance from a
      reference direction.  It is usually measured from 000 degrees at
      the reference direction clockwise through 360 degrees.

      The <bearing> element is of type gml:DirectionPropertyType and
      contains a gml:DirectionVector, gml:CompassPoint,
      DirectionKeyword, or a DirectionString element.  This document
      profiles the usage of this GML element and mandates applications
      using this document to make use of the <DirectionVector> element
      only.

   acceleration:

      This element specifies the rate (usually rapid) at which something
      happens.  The <acceleration> element also contains a 'uom'
      attribute.

   directionOfObject:

      The <directionOfObject> describes the instantaneous horizontal of
      the front of the object relative to true north and the vertical
      angle relative to the earth's spheroid.  It uses the GML
      <directionVector> element.

   GML permits a range of units of measure for the uom attribute.  This
   document restricts this set to the #m/s (meters per second).


4.  XML Schema

   This document does not define a new schema but instead re-uses a
   subset of the dynamicFeature.xsd schema available with GML 3.1.1,
   namely <speed>, <bearing>, <acceleration>, and <directionOfObject>.

   These four elements are conveyed inside the <location-info> element
   defined by RFC 4119 [RFC4119].


5.  Example

   The following example shows a PIDF-LO document indicating geospatial
   location information using the gml:Point structure.  Following the
   <gml:location> element the additional fields releated to temporal
   characteristics are included.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines additional location elements carried by PIDF-LO
   (see [RFC4119]).  The security considerations of RFC 4119 [RFC4119]
   are applicable to this document.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require actions by IANA.

Appendix A.  Transferring Multiple Location Objects within SIP

   To show the path of an object, it may be useful to deliver multiple
   location vector objects in one PIDF-LO document to reduce the number
   of notifications.  The <timed-presence> element [RFC4481] can contain
   multiple location objects, with the structure shown in Figure 2 and
   an example in Figure 3.
