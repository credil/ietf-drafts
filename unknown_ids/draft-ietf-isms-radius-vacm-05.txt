 Extensions to the View-based Access Control Model for use with RADIUS
                   draft-ietf-isms-radius-vacm-05.txt

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular, it
   describes a backward-compatible supplement to the View-based Access
   Control Model (VACM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management
   Protocol (SNMPv3) for use with the Remote Authentication Dial-In User
   Service (RADIUS) or other Authentication, Authorization, and
   Accounting (AAA) services to provide authorization of MIB database
   access, and defines objects for managing this supplement.  It is
   intended to be used in conjunction with session-oriented secure SNMP
   Transport Models that facilitate RADIUS authentication, such as the
   Secure Shell Transport Model.

   Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's
   mailing list at isms@ietf.org.

1.  Introduction

   This memo specifies an integration of several protocols to
   operationally simplify the administration of the access rights
   granted to users of network management data.  It functions to
   dynamically provision selected MIB objects associated with VACM
   [RFC3415] based on information received from RADIUS or other AAA
   service.  It requires no changes to the Abstract Service Interface
   for the Access Control Subsystem, nor any changes in the Elements of
   Procedure for VACM.  It provides a MIB module that reflects the
   information received from the AAA service, as well as the elements of
   procedure for maintaining that information and the corresponding
   updates to VACM data.

   In this environment:


   o  The View-Based Access Control Model (VACM) [RFC3415] provides a
      means to manage users' access rights to management information
      accessed using SNMP.

   o  The Simple Network Management Protocol version 3 (SNMPv3) provides
      message security services through the Security Subsystem.

   o  The Transport Subsystem for the Simple Network Management Protocol
      [RFC5590] defines a Transport Subsystem.

   o  The Transport Security Model for SNMP [RFC5591] defines a
      Transport Security Model.

   o  The Secure Shell Transport Model for SNMP [RFC5592] defines a
      Secure Shell Transport Model and Remote Authentication Dial-In
      User Service (RADIUS).

   o  RADIUS Usage for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
      Transport Models [RFC5608] defines a method for authenticating
      SNMPv3 users via RADIUS.


   It is possible to authenticate SNMPv3 messages via a RADIUS when
   those messages are sent over the SSH transport.  As originally
   envisioned, VACM authorizes a given SNMP transaction using on-device,
   pre-existing authorization configuration.  In order to leverage a
   centralized RADIUS service to its full extent, the access control
   decision in the Access Control Subsystem needs to be able to make use
   of authorization information received from RADIUS as well.  This memo
   defines an extension to the View-based Access Control Model to obtain
   authorization information for an authenticated principal, from RADIUS

   or equivalent AAA service supporting a Transport Security Model.

   Additional introductory material on the RADIUS operational model and
   RADIUS usage with SNMP may be found in Sections 1.3 and 1.5 of
   [RFC5608].

   It is important to understand the SNMP architecture and the
   terminology of the architecture to understand where the View-based
   Access Control Model supplement described in this memo fits into the
   architecture and how it interacts with other subsystems and models
   within the architecture.  It is expected that reader will have also
   read and understood RFC3411 [RFC3411], RFC3412 [RFC3412], RFC3413
   [RFC3413], RFC3415 [RFC3415]and RFC3418 [RFC3418].  As this memo
   describes a supplement to VACM, a thorough understanding of RFC3415
   [RFC3415] is assumed.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

                               Block Diagram

   This diagram illustrates that a network management application
   communicates with a network device, the managed entity, using, for
   example, SNMP over SSH.  The network device uses RADIUS to
   communicate with a RADIUS Server to authenticate the network
   management application (or the user whose credentials that
   application provides) and to obtain authorization information related
   to access via SNMP for purpose of device management.  Other secure
   transport protocols might be used instead of SSH, and other AAA
   services might be used instead of RADIUS.

4.2.  Using RADIUS with SNMP

   There are two use cases for RADIUS support of management access via
   SNMP.  These are (a) service authorization and (b) access control
   authorization.  The former is discussed in detail in [RFC5608].  The
   second use case is the subject of this document.  This document
   describes how RADIUS attributes and messages are applied to the
   specific application area of SNMP Access Control Models, and VACM in
   particular.

   The RFC 3411 SNMP architecture maintains strong modularity and
   separation of concerns, extending to separating user identity
   (authentication) from user database access rights (authorization).
   The former is the business of the Security Subsystem and the latter
   is the business of the Access Control Subsystem.  RADIUS, on the
   other hand, allows for no such separation of authorization from
   authentication.  In order to use RADIUS with SNMP, binding of user
   authentication to user authorization must be achieved, without
   violating the modularity of the RFC 3411 SNMP architecture.

   RADIUS does support a limited form of Authorize-Only operations.  The
   RADIUS "Authorize Only" Service-Type Attribute can be specified in an
   Access-Request message, but only when accompanied by a RADIUS State
   Attribute, which contains an implementation specific "cookie"
   representing the successful outcome of a previous authentication
   transaction.  For that reason, it is not possible to completely
   separate the use of RADIUS by the Access Control Subsystem from the
   use of RADIUS by other subsystems.  This suggests that the most
   straightforward approach is to leverage the existing RADIUS usage, as
   documented in [RFC5608], and the tmStateReference cache, as
   documented in Section 5.2 of [RFC5590].

   The operative use case assumption here is that roles within an
   organization, which are reflected in VACM as groups and rules, change
   infrequently, while the users assigned to those roles change much
   more frequently.  This memo describes how the user-to-role (group)
   mapping can be outsourced to the RADIUS server, avoiding the need to
   re-provision managed devices as users are added, deleted, or assigned
   new roles in an organization.

   This memo assumes that the detailed access control policies are pre-
   configured in VACM, and does not attempt to address the question of
   how the policy associated with a given role is put in place.

   The only additional information obtained from the AAA service is the
   mapping of the authenticated user's identifier to a specific role (or
   "group" in VACM terminology) in the access control policy.  Dynamic
   user authorization for MIB database access control, as defined
   herein, is limited to mapping the authenticated user to a group,
   which in turn is mapped to the pre-existing rules.

   This memo relies on implementation-specific integration of the AAA
   client for user authentication and authorization.  In particular, the
   implementation MUST make the RADIUS Management-Policy-Id [RFC5607]
   and User-Name Attributes (or their equivalents) from the RADIUS
   Access-Accept message (or equivalent) available to this function.

4.3.  Applicability

   Though this memo was motivated to support the use of specific
   Transport Security Models, it MAY be used with other Transport
   Security Models whose implementations satisfy these requirements:


   o  the model has a notion of "session";

   o  the model uses an AAA service for sign-on service authorization;




Narayan, et al.         Expires September 7, 2010               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             RADIUS-Enabled VACM                March 2010


   o  the model provides an indication of the establishment session for
      a particular user, identified using a SecurityName, and provides
      the corresponding value of vacmGroupName to be used, based on
      information provided by the AAA service in use;

   o  the model provides an indication of the end of a session, whether
      due to disconnection, termination due to timeout, or any other
      reason.

   Likewise, although this memo specifically refers to RADIUS, it MAY be
   used with other AAA services satisfying these requirements:


   o  the service provides information semantically equivalent to the
      RADIUS Management-Policy-ID attribute [RFC5607], which has been
      mapped (perhaps trivially) into a GroupName;

   o  the service provides information semantically equivalent to the
      RADIUS User-Name Attribute, which has been mapped (perhaps
      trivially) into a SecurityName.


5.  Structure of the MIB Module

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   This MIB module makes use of the SnmpAdminString and
   SnmpSecurityModel textual conventions.

5.2.  The Table Structure

   This MIB module defines a single table, the
   extVacmSecurityToGroupTable.  This table is indexed by the integer
   assigned to each security model, the protocol-independent
   SecurityName corresponding to a principal, and the unique identifier
   of a transport model session.  This index structure was chosen to
   support use cases in which a given user could potentially have
   multiple concurrent sessions, and to support environments in which
   multiple security models might find concurrent usage.


6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This MIB module has a close operational relationship with the SNMP-
   VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB (more commonly known as the "VACM MIB") from
   [RFC3415].  It also relies on IMPORTS from several other modules.

Internet-Draft             RADIUS-Enabled VACM                March 2010


6.1.  Relationship to the VACM MIB

   Although the MIB module defined here has a close relationship with
   the VACM MIB's vacmSecurityToGroupTable, it in no way changes the
   elements of procedure for VACM, nor does it affect any other tables
   defined in VACM.  See the elements of procedure (below) for details
   of how the contents of the vacmSecurityToGroupTable are affected by
   this MIB module.

6.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   This MIB module employs definitions from [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and
   [RFC3411].


7.  Elements of Procedure

   The following elements of procedure are formulated in terms of two
   types of events: an indication of the establishment of a secure
   transport model session, and an indication that one has ended.  These
   events can result in the creation of entries in the
   extVacmSecurityToGroupTable, which can in turn trigger creation,
   update, or deletion of entries in the vacmSecurityToGroupTable.

   There are various possible implementation-specific error cases not
   spelled out here, such as running out of memory.  By their nature,
   recovery in such cases will be implementation-specific.  Implementers
   are advised to consider fail-safe strategies, e.g., prematurely
   terminating access in preference to erroneously perpetuating access.

7.1.  Sequencing Requirements

   These procedures assume that a secure transport model, such as
   [RFC5592], coordinates session establishment with AAA authorization.
   The security model SHOULD bind principal identity to access control
   policy via an external AAA server, as the Transport Security Model
   does.  To do otherwise potentially creates a security risk.

   To ensure correct processing of SNMP PDUs, the handling of the
   indication of the establishment of a session in accordance with the
   elements of procedure below MUST be completed before the
   IsAccessAllowed() abstract service interface is invoked for any SNMP
   PDUs from that session.

   To ensure correct processing of SNMP PDUs, the handling of the
   indication of the termination of a session in accordance with the
   elements of procedure below MUST NOT be initiated before all
   invocations of the IsAccessAllowed() abstract service interface have

Internet-Draft             RADIUS-Enabled VACM                March 2010


   completed for all SNMP PDUs from that session.

7.2.  Actions Upon Session Establishment Indication

   Four pieces of information are needed to process the session
   establishment indication:

   o  the SecurityModel

   o  the RADIUS User-Name Attribute or equivalent

   o  a session identifier

   o  the RADIUS Management-Policy-Id Attribute or equivalent

   In particular, if either the User-Name or Management-Policy-Id is
   absent, invalid, or a zero-length string, no further processing of
   the session establishment indication is undertaken.

7.2.1.  Creation of Entries in extVacmSecurityToGroupTable

   Whenever an indication arrives that a new secure transport model
   session has been established, determine whether a corresponding entry
   exists in the extVacmSecurityToGroupTable.  If one does not, create a
   new row with the columns populated as follows:

   o  extVacmSecurityModel = value of SnmpSecurityModel corresponding to
      the security model in use

   o  extVacmSecurityName = RADIUS User-Name Attribute or equivalent

   o  extVacmTransportSessionID = unique session identifier provided by
      the Secure Transport Model

   o  extVacmGroupName = RADIUS Management-Policy-Id Attribute or
      equivalent

   Otherwise, if the row already exists, update the extVacmGroupName
   with the value supplied.

7.2.2.  Creation of Entries in vacmSecurityToGroupTable

   Whenever an entry is created in the extVacmSecurityToGroupTable, the
   vacmSecurityToGroupTable is examined to determine whether a
   corresponding entry exists there, using the value of
   extVacmSecurityModel for vacmSecurityModel, and the value of
   extVacmSecurityName for vacmSecurityName.  If no corresponding entry
   exists, create one, using the extVacmGroupName of the newly-created



Narayan, et al.         Expires September 7, 2010              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft             RADIUS-Enabled VACM                March 2010


   entry to fill in vacmGroupName, using a value of "volatile" for
   vacmSecurityToGroupStorageType, and a value of "active" for
   vacmSecurityToGroupStatus.

   If a corresponding entry already exists in the
   vacmSecurityToGroupTable, and the row's StorageType is anything other
   than "volatile", or the RowStatus is anything other than "active",
   then a role (group) mapping for this user (principal) has already
   been put in place on this system, and will not be overridden.

7.2.3.  Update of vacmGroupName

   Whenever the value of an instance of extVacmGroupName is updated, if
   a corresponding entry exists in the vacmSecurityToGroupTable, and
   vacmSecurityToGroupStorageType is "volatile" and
   vacmSecurityToGroupStatus is "active", update the value of
   vacmGroupName with the value from extVacmGroupName.

   The operational assumption here is that if the row's StorageType is
   "volatile", then this entry was probably dynamically created by this
   function; an entry created by a security administrator would not
   normally be given a StorageType of "volatile".  If value being
   provided by RADIUS (or other AAA service) is the same as what is
   already there, this is a no-op.  If the value is different, the new
   information is understood as a more recent role (group) assignment
   for the user, which should supercede the one currently held there.

7.3.  Actions Upon Session Termination Indication

   Whenever a RADIUS (or other AAA) authenticated secure transport model
   session ends for any reason, an indication is provided to this
   function.  This indication MUST provide means of determining the
   SecurityModel and an identifier for the session, which MUST be unique
   at least within the scope of that SecurityModel.  The manner in which
   this occurs is implementation dependent.

7.3.1.  Deletion of Entries from extVacmSecurityToGroupTable

   Entries in the extVacmSecurityToGroupTable MUST NOT persist across
   system reboots.

   When notified that a session has been terminated, the
   extVacmSecurityToGroupTable is searched for a corresponding entry.
   (A "matching" entry is any entry for which the SecurityModel and
   session ID match the information associated with the session
   termination indication.)  Any matching entries are deleted.  It is
   possible that no entries will match; this is not an error, and no

7.3.2.  Deletion of Entries from vacmSecurityToGroupTable

   Whenever the last remaining row bearing a particular
   (extVacmSecurityModel, extVacmSecurityName) pair is deleted from the
   extVacmSecurityToGroupTable, the vacmSecurityToGroupTable is examined
   for a corresponding row.  If one exists, and if its StorageType is
   "volatile" and its RowStatus is "active", that row MUST be deleted as
   well.  The mechanism to accomplish this task is implementation
   specific.

9.  Security Considerations

   This integration strongly assumes that RADIUS (or some other AAA
   service) is at least as trusted as the security administrator with
   access rights to the vacmSecurityToGroupTable.  It assumes that the
   transport security model can be trusted to pass through the users'
   security name and the group name provided by the AAA service.  It
   also trusts the transport security model to enforce any session
   timeouts imposed by the RADIUS server, and to provide an indicate
   whenever a session ends.

   The algorithms in this memo make heuristic use of the StorageType of



Narayan, et al.         Expires September 7, 2010              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft             RADIUS-Enabled VACM                March 2010


   entries in the vacmSecurityToGroupTable to distinguish those which
   have been provisioned by a security administrator (which would
   presumably not be configured as "volatile") and those dynamically
   generated.  In making this distinction, it assumes that those entries
   explicitly provisioned by a security administrator and given a
   non-"volatile" status are not to be dynamically over-ridden.  Users
   of this memo need to be aware of this operational assumption, which,
   while reasonable, is not necessarily universal.

   The design of VACM ensures that if an unknown policy (group name) is
   used in the VacmSecurityToGroupTable, no access is granted.  A
   consequence of this is that even in the presence of a malfunctioning
   or compromised AAA server, no user can gain access rights not already
   granted to some group.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (including some
   objects with a MAX-ACCESS of not-accessible, whose values are exposed
   as a result access to indexed objects) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:


   o  extVacmSecurityToGroupTable - the entire table is potentially
      sensitive, since walking the table will reveal user names,
      security models in use, transport model session identifiers, and
      group names.

   o  extVacmSecurityModel - though not-accessible, this is exposed as
      an index of extVacmGroupName

   o  extVacmSecurityName - though not-accessible, this is exposed as an
      index of extVacmGroupName

   o  extVacmTransportSessionID - though not-accessible, this is exposed
      as an index of extVacmGroupName

   o  extVacmGroupName - since this identifies a security policy and
      associates it with a particular user, this is potentially
      sensitive.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.


10.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:



      Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
      ----------        -----------------------
      snmpExtVacmMIB    { mib-2 XXX }


   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   This section identifies questions and issues that have not been
   addressed in this version of this document.  This section will
   probably be removed prior to publication, since there will be no
   questions left to address.

   1.  Is there really any need to talk about the tmStateReference
       cache?

   2.  Is there a need for the RFC 5590 reference to be normative?  Is
       it needed at all?

   3.  Does the reference to RFC 5591 need to be normative?
