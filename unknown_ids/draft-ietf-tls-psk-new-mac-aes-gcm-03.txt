Abstract 

   RFC 4279 and RFC 4785 describe pre-shared key cipher suites for 
   Transport Layer Security (TLS).  However, all those cipher suites 
   use SHA-1 as their MAC algorithm.  This document describes a set of 
   pre-shared key cipher suites for TLS which uses stronger digest 
   algorithms (i.e., SHA-256 or SHA-384) and another set which uses the 
   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois Counter Mode (GCM).

Internet-Draft       TLS PSK New MAC and AES-GCM         September 2008 
    

1. Introduction 

   The benefits of pre-shared symmetric-key vs. public-/private-key 
   pair based authentication for the key exchange in TLS have been 
   explained in the Introduction of [RFC4279].  This document leverages 
   the already defined algorithms for the application of newer, 
   generally regarded stronger, cryptographic primitives and building 
   blocks. 

   TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] adds support for authenticated encryption with 
   additional data (AEAD) cipher modes [RFC5116]. This document 
   describes the use of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [AES] in 
   Galois Counter Mode (GCM) [GCM] (AES-GCM) with various pre-shared 
   key (PSK) authenticated key exchange mechanisms ([RFC4279] and 
   [RFC4785]) in cipher suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS).  

   This document also specifies PSK cipher suites for TLS which replace 
   SHA-1 by SHA-256 or SHA-384 [SHS].  RFC 4279 [RFC4279] and RFC 4785 
   [RFC4785] describe PSK cipher suites for TLS.  However, all of the 
   RFC 4279 and the RFC 4785 cipher suites use HMAC-SHA1 as their MAC 
   algorithm.  Due to recent analytic work on SHA-1 [Wang05], the IETF 
   is gradually moving away from SHA-1 and towards stronger hash 
   algorithms. 

   Related TLS cipher suites with key exchange algorithms that are 
   authenticated using public/private key pairs have recently been 
   specified: 

      - RSA, DSS, and Diffie-Hellman based cipher suites in [RFC5288],  
        and 

       -ECC based cipher suites with SHA-256/384 and AES-GCM in  
        [RFC5289]. 

   The reader is expected to become familiar with these two memos prior 
   to studying this document. 

1.1. Conventions used in this document  

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

2. PSK, DHE_PSK and RSA_PSK Key Exchange Algorithms with AES-GCM 

   The following six cipher suites use the new authenticated encryption 
   modes defined in TLS 1.2 with AES in Galois Counter Mode (GCM)

   [GCM].  The cipher suites with DHE_PSK key exchange algorithm 
   (TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and 
   TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA348) provide Perfect Forward Secrecy 
   (PFS). 

      CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256        = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384        = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256    = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384    = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256    = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384    = {0xXX,0xXX}; 

   These cipher suites use authenticated encryption with additional 
   data (AEAD) algorithms AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM as 
   described in RFC 5116.  GCM is used as described in [RFC5288]. 

   The PSK, DHE_PSK and RSA_PSK key exchanges are performed as defined 
   in [RFC4279]. 

   The PRFs SHALL be as follows: 

       For cipher suites ending with _SHA256, the PRF is the TLS PRF  
       [RFC5246] with SHA-256 as the hash function. 

       For cipher suites ending with _SHA384, the PRF is the TLS PRF  
       [RFC5246] with SHA-384 as the hash function. 

   Implementations MUST send a TLS Alert 'bad_record_mac' for all types 
   of failures encountered in processing the AES-GCM algorithm. 

3. PSK, DHE_PSK and RSA_PSK Key Exchange with SHA-256/384 

   The cipher suites described in this section use AES [AES] in CBC 
   [CBC] mode with an HMAC-based MAC. 

3.1. PSK Key Exchange Algorithm with SHA-256/384 

      CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256        = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384        = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA256               = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA384               = {0xXX,0xXX}; 

   The above four cipher suites are the same as the corresponding 
   cipher suites in RFC 4279 and RFC 4785 (with names ending in "_SHA" 
   in place of "_SHA256" or "_SHA384"), except for the hash and PRF 
   algorithms.

Internet-Draft       TLS PSK New MAC and AES-GCM         September 2008 
    

   The PRF and MAC algorithms SHALL be as follows: 

       For cipher suites ending with _SHA256, the PRF is the TLS PRF  
       [RFC5246] with SHA-256 as the hash function.   
       The MAC is HMAC [RFC2104] with SHA-256 as the hash function. 

       For cipher suites ending with _SHA384, the PRF is the TLS PRF  
       [RFC5246] with SHA-384 as the hash function.   
       The MAC is HMAC [RFC2104] with SHA-384 as the hash function. 

3.2. DHE_PSK Key Exchange Algorithm with SHA-256/384 

      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256    = {0xXX,0xXX};   
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384    = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA256           = {0xXX,0xXX};     
      CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA384           = {0xXX,0xXX}; 

   The above four cipher suites are the same as the corresponding 
   cipher suites in RFC 4279 and RFC 4785 (with names ending in "_SHA" 
   in place of "_SHA256" or "_SHA384"), except for the hash and PRF 
   algorithms, as explained in section 3.1. 

3.3. RSA_PSK Key Exchange Algorithm with SHA-256/384 

      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256    = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384    = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA256           = {0xXX,0xXX}; 
      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA384           = {0xXX,0xXX}; 

   The above four cipher suites are the same as the corresponding 
   cipher suites in RFC 4279 and RFC 4785 (with names ending in "_SHA" 
   in place of "_SHA256" or "_SHA384"), except for the hash and PRF 
   algorithms, as explained in section 3.1. 

4. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations in [RFC4279], [RFC4758] and [RFC5288] 
   apply to this document as well.  In addition, as described in 
   [RFC5288], these cipher suites may only be used with TLS 1.2 or 
   greater. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   IANA has assigned the following values for the cipher suites defined 
   in this document:
