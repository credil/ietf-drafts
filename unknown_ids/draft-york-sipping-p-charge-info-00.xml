    <abstract>
       <t>This document describes 'P-Charge-Info', a private Session Initiation Protocol
       (SIP) header (P-header) used by a number of equipment vendors and
       carriers to convey simple billing information.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title="Overview">
        <t>In certain network configurations, it is desirable to decouple
	the Caller ID from the number used for billing purposes.  This
	document describes the current usage of 'P-Charge-Info', a private
	SIP header, to provide simple billing information and requests the
	registration of this header with IANA as required by section 4.1 of
	RFC 3427.</t>
	
	<t>In a
	typical configuration, "Caller ID" is derived from one of the
	following SIP headers:<list style="symbols">
	   <t>Remote-Party-ID</t>
	   <t>P-Asserted-Identity</t>
	   <t>From (in the absence of the other two)</t>
	</list>This number is typically presented to the receiving UA where
	it is usually displayed for the end user.  It is also typically
	used for billing purposes by the network entities involved in
	carrying the session.  </t>
	<t>However, in a distributed environment the "Caller ID" presented
	to the receiving UA may not reflect the actual reality of the
	underlying network in terms of costs incurred on the PSTN. This may
	result in excessive charging of one carrier by another based on the
	erroneous assumption that the call was originating from a different
	point on the PSTN.</t>

	<t>There exists a need for a way to pass an additional billing
	identifier that can be used between network entities in order to
	correctly bill for services.  At least one equipment provider,
	Sonus Networks, and several carriers have begun using the
	"P-Charge-Info" header as a simple mechanism to exchange this
	billing identifier.</t>

        <t>It should be noted that the 3GPP has also recognized the need for such a billing
	identifier and in section 4.6 of RFC 3455 established a SIP P-Header, "P-Charging-Vector",
	to provide similar information.  This header, though, is designed
	for use within 3GPP environments and includes more information than
	is required in many simpler environments.</t>

        document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</t>

	 is typically inserted by the SIP proxy on the originating network.</t>

       <t>The Private Header specified in this document is described in
   both prose and an augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) defined in RFC
   2234.  Further, several BNF definitions are inherited from SIP
   and are not repeated here.  Implementors need to be familiar with the
   notation and contents of SIP [1] and RFC 2234 [3] to understand this
   document.</t>
       <t>They syntax of the P-Charge-Info header is described as follows:</t>
       <t>[Information to be completed.]</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document defines a private SIP extension header field
      (beginning with the prefixe "P-").</t>
      <t>The extension is registered as a private extension field:</t>
      <t>RFC Number:	RFCXXXX [Note to IANA: Fill in with the RFC number
      of this specification.</t>
      <t>Header Field Name:  P-Charge-Info</t>
      <t>Compact Form:  none</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
       <t>Given that the information contained in the P-Charge-Info header
       will be used for billing purposes the proxies that share this
       information MUST have a trust relationship.</t>
       <t>If an untrusted entity were inserted between the trusted
       entities, it could potentially interfere with the billing records
       for the call.  If the SIP connections are not made over a private
       WAN, a mechanism for securing the confidentiality and integrity of
       the SIP connection should be used to protect the information.</t>
