    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Wireless, low-power field devices enable industrial users to
      significantly increase the amount of information collected and the
      number of control points that can be remotely managed. The deployment of
      these wireless devices will significantly improve the productivity and
      safety of the plants while increasing the efficiency of the plant
      workers.</t>

      <t>Cable is perceived as a more proven, safer techhnology, and
      existing, operational deployments are very stable in time. For these
      reasons, it is not expected that wireless will replace wire in any
      foreseeable future; the consensus in the industrial space is rather that
      wireless will tremendously augment the scope and benefits of automation
      by enabling the control of devices that were not connected in the past
      for reasons of cost and/or deployment complexities. But for LLN to be
      adopted in the industrial environment, the wireless network needs to
      have three qualities: low power, high reliability, and easy installation
      and maintenance. The routing protocol used for low power and lossy
      networks (LLN) is important to fulfilling these goals.</t>

      <t>Industrial automation is segmented into two distinct application
      spaces, known as "process" or "process control" and "discrete
      manufacturing" or "factory automation". In industrial process control,
      the product is typically a fluid (oil, gas, chemicals ...). In factory
      automation or discrete manufacturing, the products are individual
      elements (screws, cars, dolls). While there is some overlap of products
      and systems between these two segments, they are surprisingly separate
      communities. The specifications targeting industrial process control
      tend to have more tolerance for network latency than what is needed for
      factory automation.</t>

      <t>Irrespective of this different 'process' and 'discrete' plant nature
      both plant types will have similar needs for automating the collection
      of data that used to be collected manually, or was not collected before.
      Examples are wireless sensors that report the state of a fuse, report
      the state of a luminary, HVAC status, report vibration levels on pumps,
      report man-down, and so on.</t>

      <t>Other novel application arenas that equally apply to both 'process'
      and 'discrete' involve mobile sensors that roam in and out of plants,
      such as active sensor tags on containers or vehicles.</t>

      <t>Some if not all of these applications will need to be served by the
      same low power and lossy wireless network technology. This may mean
      several disconnected, autonomous LLN networks connecting to multiple
      hosts, but sharing the same ether. Interconnecting such networks, if
      only to supervise channel and priority allocations, or to fully
      synchronize, or to share path capacity within a set of physical network
      components may be desired, or may not be desired for practical reasons,
      such as e.g. cyber security concerns in relation to plant safety and
      integrity.</t>

      <t>All application spaces desire battery operated networks of hundreds
      of sensors and actuators communicating with LLN access points. In an oil
      refinery, the total number of devices might exceed one million, but the
      devices will be clustered into smaller networks that in most cases
      interconnect and report to an existing plant network infrastructure.</t>

      <t>Existing wired sensor networks in this space typically use
      communication protocols with low data rates, from 1,200 baud (e.g. wired
      HART) to the one to two hundred Kbps range for most of the others. The
      existing protocols are often master/slave with command/response.</t>

      <section title="Applications and Traffic Patterns">
        <t>The industrial market classifies process applications into three
        broad categories and six classes.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Safety <list style="symbols">
                <t>Class 0: Emergency action - Always a critical function</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Control<list style="symbols">
                <t>Class 1: Closed loop regulatory control - Often a critical
                function</t>

                <t>Class 2: Closed loop supervisory control - Usually
                non-critical function</t>

                <t>Class 3: Open loop control – Operator takes action and
                controls the actuator (human in the loop)</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Monitoring <list style="symbols">
                <t>Class 4: Alerting - Short-term operational effect (for
                example event-based maintenance)</t>

                <t>Class 5: Logging and downloading / uploading - No immediate
                operational consequence (e.g., history collection,
                sequence-of-events, preventive maintenance)</t>
              </list></t>
          </list> Safety critical functions effect the basic safety integrity
        of the plant. These normally dormant functions kick in only when
        process control systems, or their operators, have failed. By design
        and by regular interval inspection, they have a well-understood
        probability of failure on demand in the range of typically once per
        10-1000 years.</t>

        <t>In-time deliveries of messages becomes more relevant as the class
        number decreases.</t>

        <t>Note that for a control application, the jitter is just as
        important as latency and has a potential of destabilizing control
        algorithms.</t>

        <t>Industrial users are interested in deploying wireless networks for
        the monitoring classes 4 and 5, and in the non-critical portions of
        classes 3 through 2.</t>

        <t>Classes 4 and 5 also include asset monitoring and tracking which
        include equipment monitoring and are essentially separate from process
        monitoring. An example of equipment monitoring is the recording of
        motor vibrations to detect bearing wear. However, similar sensors
        detecting excessive vibration levels could be used as safeguarding
        loops that immediately initiate a trip, and thus end up being class
        0.</t>

        <t>In the near future, most LLN systems in industrial automation
        environments will be for low frequency data collection. Packets
        containing samples will be generated continuously, and 90% of the
        market is covered by packet rates of between 1/s and 1/hour, with the
        average under 1/min. In industrial process, these sensors include
        temperature, pressure, fluid flow, tank level, and corrosion. Some
        sensors are bursty, such as vibration monitors that may generate and
        transmit tens of kilo-bytes (hundreds to thousands of packets) of
        time-series data at reporting rates of minutes to days.</t>

        <t>Almost all of these sensors will have built-in microprocessors that
        may detect alarm conditions. Time-critical alarm packets are expected
        to be granted a lower latency than periodic sensor data streams.</t>

        <t>Some devices will transmit a log file every day, again with
        typically tens of Kbytes of data. For these applications there is very
        little "downstream" traffic coming from the LLN access point and
        traveling to particular sensors. During diagnostics, however, a
        technician may be investigating a fault from a control room and expect
        to have "low" latency (human tolerable) in a command/response
        mode.</t>

        <t>Low-rate control, often with a "human in the loop" (also referred
        to as "open loop"), is implemented via communication to a control room
        because that's where the human in the loop will be. The sensor data
        makes its way through the LLN access point to the centralized
        controller where it is processed, the operator sees the information
        and takes action, and the control information is then sent out to the
        actuator node in the network.</t>

        <t>In the future, it is envisioned that some open loop processes will
        be automated (closed loop) and packets will flow over local loops and
        not involve the LLN access point. These closed loop controls for
        non-critical applications will be implemented on LLNs. Non-critical
        closed loop applications have a latency requirement that can be as low
        as 100 ms but many control loops are tolerant of latencies above 1
        s.</t>

        <t>More likely though is that loops will be closed in the field
        entirely, and in such a case, having wireless links within the control
        loop does not usually present actual value. Most control loops have
        sensors and actuators within such proximity that a wire between them
        remains the most sensible option from an economic point of view. This
        'control in the field' architecture is already common practice with
        wired field busses. An 'upstream' wireless link would only be used to
        influence the in-field controller settings, and to occasionally
        capture diagnostics. Even though the link back to a control room might
        be a wireless, this architecture reduces the tight latency and
        availability requirements for the wireless links.</t>

        <t>Closing loops in the field: <list style="symbols">
            <t>does not prevent the same loop from being closed through a
            remote multi-variable controller during some modes of operation,
            while being closed directly in the field during other modes of
            operation (e.g., fallback, or when timing is more critical)</t>

            <t>does not imply that the loop will be closed with a wired
            connection, or that the wired connection is more energy efficient
            even when it exists as an alternate to the wireless
            connection.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>A realistic future scenario is for a field device with a battery or
        ultra-capacitor power storage to have both wireless and unpowered
        wired communications capability (e.g., galvanically isolated RS-485),
        where the wireless communication is more flexible and, for local loop
        operation, more energy efficient, and the wired communication
        capability serves as a backup interconnect among the loop elements,
        but without a wired connection back to the operations center
        blockhouse. In other words, the loop elements are interconnected
        through wiring to a nearby junction box, but the 2 km home-run link
        from the junction box to the control center does not exist.</t>

        <t>When wireless communication conditions are good, devices use
        wireless for loop interconnect, and either one wireless device reports
        alarms and other status to the control center for all elements of the
        loop or each element reports independently. When wireless
        communications are sporadic, the loop interconnect uses the
        self-powered galvanically-isolated RS-485 link and one of the devices
        with good wireless communications to the control center serves as a
        router for those devices which are unable to contact the control
        center directly.</t>

        <t>The above approach is particularly attractive for large storage
        tanks in tank farms, where devices may not all have good wireless
        visibility of the control center, and where a home run cable from the
        tank to the control center is undesirable due to the electro-potential
        differences between the tank location and the distant control center
        that arise during lightning storms.</t>

        <t>In fast control, tens of milliseconds of latency is typical. In
        many of these systems, if a packet does not arrive within the
        specified interval, the system enters an emergency shutdown state,
        often with substantial financial repercussions. For a one-second
        control loop in a system with a mean-time between shutdowns target of
        30 years, the latency requirement implies nine 9s of reliability.
        Given such exposure, given the intrinsic vulnerability of wireless
        link availability, and given the emergence of control in the field
        architectures, most users tend to not aim for fast closed loop control
        with wireless links within that fast loop.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Network Topology of Industrial Applications">
        <t>Although network topology is difficult to generalize, the majority
        of existing applications can be met by networks of 10 to 200 field
        devices and maximum number of hops of twenty. It is assumed that the
        field devices themselves will provide routing capability for the
        network, and additional repeaters/routers will not be required in most
        cases.</t>

        <t>For the vast majority of industrial applications, the traffic is
        mostly composed of real time publish/subscribe sensor data also
        referred to as buffered, from the field devices over a LLN towards one
        or more sinks. Increasingly over time, these sinks will be a part of a
        backbone but today they are often fragmented and isolated.</t>

        <t>The wireless sensor network is a LLN of field devices for which two
        logical roles are defined, the field routers and the non routing
        devices. It is acceptable and even probable that the repartition of
        the roles across the field devices change over time to balance the
        cost of the forwarding operation amongst the nodes.</t>

        <t>In order to scale a control network in terms of density, one
        possible architecture is to deploy a backbone as a canopy that
        aggregates multiple smaller LLNs. The backbone is a high-speed
        infrastructure network that may interconnect multiple WSNs through
        backbone routers. Infrastructure devices can be connected to the
        backbone. A gateway / manager that interconnects the backbone to the
        plant network of the corporate network can be viewed as collapsing the
        backbone and the infrastructure devices into a single device that
        operates all the required logical roles. The backbone is likely to
        become an option in the industrial network.</t>

        <t>Typically, such backbones interconnect to the 'legacy' wired plant
        infrastructure, the plant network, also known as the 'Process Control
        Domain', the PCD. These plant automation networks are domain wise
        segregated from the office network or office domain (OD), which in
        itself is typically segregated from the Internet.</t>

        <t>Sinks for LLN sensor data reside on both the plant network PCD, the
        business network OD, and on the Internet. Applications close to
        existing plant automation, such as wired process control and
        monitoring systems running on fieldbusses, that require high
        availability and low latencies, and that are managed by 'Control and
        Automation' departments typically reside on the PCD. Other
        applications such as automated corrosion monitoring, cathodic
        protection voltage verification, or machine condition (vibration)
        monitoring where one sample per week is considered over sampling,
        would more likely deliver their sensor readings in the office domain.
        Such applications are 'owned' by e.g. maintenance departments.</t>

        <t>Yet other applications like third party maintained luminaries, or
        vendor managed inventory systems, where a supplier of chemicals needs
        access to tank level readings at his customer's site, will be best
        served with direct Internet connectivity all the way to its sensor at
        his customer's site. Temporary 'Babysitting sensors' deployed for just
        a few days, say during startup or troubleshooting or for ad-hoc
        measurement campaigns for R and D purposes are other examples where
        Internet would be the domain where wireless sensor data shall land,
        and other domains such as office and plant should preferably be
        circumvented if quick deployment without potentially impacting plant
        safety integrity is required.</t>

        <t>This multiple domain multiple applications connectivity creates a
        significant challenge. Many different applications will all share the
        same medium, the ether, within the fence, preferably sharing the same
        frequency bands, and preferably sharing the same protocols, preferably
        synchronized to optimize co-existence challenges, yet logically
        segregated to avoid creation of intolerable short cuts between
        existing wired domains.</t>

        <t>Given this challenge, LLN networks are best to be treated as all
        sitting on yet another segregated domain, segregated from all other
        wired domains where conventional security is organized by perimeter.
        Moving away from the traditional perimeter security mindset means
        moving towards stronger end-device identity authentication, so that
        LLN access points can split the various wireless data streams and
        interconnect back to the appropriate domain pending identity and trust
        established by the gateways in the authenticity of message
        originators.</t>

        <t>Similar considerations are to be given to how multiple applications
        may or may not be allowed to share routing devices and their
        potentially redundant bandwidth within the network. Challenges here
        are to balance available capacity, required latencies, expected
        priorities, and last but not least available (battery) energy within
        the routing devices.</t>

        <section title="The Physical Topology">
          <t>There is no specific physical topology for an industrial process
          control network. One extreme example is a multi-square-kilometer
          refinery where isolated tanks, some of them with power but most with
          no backbone connectivity, compose a farm that spans over of the
          surface of the plant. A few hundred field devices are deployed to
          ensure the global coverage using a wireless self-forming
          self-healing mesh network that might be 5 to 10 hops across. Local
          feedback loops and mobile workers tend to be only one or two hops.
          The backbone is in the refinery proper, many hops away. Even there,
          powered infrastructure is also typically several hops away. So
          hopping to/from the powered infrastructure will in general be more
          costly than the direct route.</t>

          <t>In the opposite extreme case, the backbone network spans all the
          nodes and most nodes are in direct sight of one or more backbone
          router. Most communication between field devices and infrastructure
          devices as well as field device to field device occurs across the
          backbone. Form afar, this model resembles the WIFI ESS (Extended
          Service Set). But from a layer 3 perspective, the issues are the
          default (backbone) router selection and the routing inside the
          backbone whereas the radio hop towards the field device is in fact a
          simple local delivery.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Logical Topologies">
          <t>Most of the traffic over the LLN is publish/subscribe of sensor
          data from the field device towards a sink that can be a backbone
          router, a gateway, or a controller/manager. The destination of the
          sensor data is an Infrastructure devices that sits on the backbone
          and is reachable via one or more backbone router.</t>

          <t>For security, reliability, availability or serviceability
          reasons, it is often required that the logical topologies are not
          physically congruent over the radio network, that is they form
          logical partitions of the LLN. For instance, a routing topology that
          is set up for control should be isolated from a topology that
          reports the temperature and the status of the vents, if that second
          topology has lesser constraints for the security policy. This
          isolation might be implemented as Virtual LANs and Virtual Routing
          Tables in shared nodes in the backbone, but correspond effectively
          to physical nodes in the wireless network.</t>

          <t>Since publishing the data is the raison d'etre for most of the
          sensors, in some cases it makes sense to build proactively a set of
          routes between the sensors and one or more backbone router and
          maintain those routes at all time. Also, because of the lossy nature
          of the network, the routing in place should attempt to propose
          multiple paths in the form of Directed Acyclic Graphs oriented
          towards the destination.</t>

          <t>In contrast with the general requirement of maintaining default
          routes towards the sinks, the need for field device to field device
          connectivity is very specific and rare, though the traffic
          associated might be of foremost importance. Field device to field
          device routes are often the most critical, optimized and
          well-maintained routes. A class 0 control loop requires guaranteed
          delivery and extremely tight response times. Both the respect of
          criteria in the route computation and the quality of the maintenance
          of the route are critical for the field devices operation.
          Typically, a control loop will be using a dedicated direct wire that
          has very different capabilities, cost and constraints than the
          wireless medium, with the need to use a wireless path as a back up
          route only in case of loss of the wired path.</t>

          <t>Considering that though each field device to field device route
          computation has specific constraints in terms of latency and
          availability it can be expected that the shortest path possible will
          often be selected and that this path will be routed inside the LLN
          as opposed to via the backbone. It can also be noted that the
          lifetimes of the routes might range from minutes for a mobile
          workers to tens of years for a command and control closed loop.
          Finally, time-varying user requirements for latency and bandwidth
          will change the constraints on the routes, which might either
          trigger a constrained route recomputation, a reprovisioning of the
          underlying L2 protocols, or both in that order. For instance, a
          wireless worker may initiate a bulk transfer to configure or
          diagnose a field device. A level sensor device may need to perform a
          calibration and send a bulk file to a plant.</t>

    <section title="Traffic Characteristics">
      <t>The industrial applications fall into four large service categories
      <xref target="ISA100.11a"></xref>:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Periodic data (aka buffered). Data that is generated periodically
          and has a well understood data bandwidth requirement, both
          deterministic and predictable. Timely delivery of such data is often
          the core function of a wireless sensor network and permanent
          resources are assigned to ensure that the required bandwidth stays
          available. Buffered data usually exhibits a short time to live, and
          the newer reading obsoletes the previous. In some cases, alarms are
          low priority information that gets repeated over and over. The
          end-to-end latency of this data is not as important as the
          regularity with which the data is presented to the plant
          application.</t>

          <t>Event data. This category includes alarms and aperiodic data
          reports with bursty data bandwidth requirements. In certain cases,
          alarms are critical and require a priority service from the
          network.</t>

          <t>Client/Server. Many industrial applications are based on a
          client/server model and implement a command response protocol. The
          data bandwidth required is often bursty. The acceptable round-trip
          latency for some legacy systems was based on the time to send tens
          of bytes over a 1200 baud link. Hundreds of milliseconds is typical.
          This type of request is statistically multiplexed over the LLN and
          cost-based fair-share best-effort service is usually expected.</t>

          <t>Bulk transfer. Bulk transfers involve the transmission of blocks
          of data in multiple packets where temporary resources are assigned
          to meet a transaction time constraint. Transient resources are
          assigned for a limited period of time (related to file size and data
          rate) to meet the bulk transfers service requirements.</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="Service Parameters">
        <t>The following service parameters can affect routing decisions in a
        resource-constrained network:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Data bandwidth – the bandwidth might be allocated permanently
            or for a period of time to a specific flow that usually exhibits
            well defined properties of burstiness and throughput. Some
            bandwidth will also be statistically shared between flows in a
            best effort fashion.</t>

            <t>Latency - the time taken for the data to transit the network
            from the source to the destination. This may be expressed in terms
            of a deadline for delivery. Most monitoring latencies will be in
            seconds to minutes.</t>

            <t>Transmission phase - process applications can be synchronized
            to wall clock time and require coordinated transmissions. A common
            coordination frequency is 4 Hz (250 ms).</t>

            <t>Service contract type - revocation priority. LLNs have limited
            network resources that can vary with time. This means the system
            can become fully subscribed or even over subscribed. System
            policies determine how resources are allocated when resources are
            over subscribed. The choices are blocking and graceful
            degradation.</t>

            <t>Transmission priority - the means by which limited resources
            within field devices are allocated across multiple services. For
            transmissions, a device has to select which packet in its queue
            will be sent at the next transmission opportunity. Packet priority
            is used as one criterion for selecting the next packet. For
            reception, a device has to decide how to store a received packet.
            The field devices are memory constrained and receive buffers may
            become full. Packet priority is used to select which packets are
            stored or discarded.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The routing protocol MUST also support different metric types for
        each link used to compute the path according to some objective
        function (e.g. minimize latency).</t>

        <t>For these reasons, the ROLL routing infrastructure is required to
        compute and update constrained routes on demand, and it can be
        expected that this model will become more prevalent for field device
        to field device connectivity as well as for some field device to
        Infrastructure devices over time.</t>

        <t>Industrial application data flows between field devices are not
        necessarily symmetric. In particular, asymmetrical cost and
        unidirectional routes are common for published data and alerts, which
        represent the most part of the sensor traffic. The routing protocol
        MUST be able to compute a set of unidirectional routes with
        potentially different costs that are composed of one or more
        non-congruent paths.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Configurable Application Requirement">
        <t>Time-varying user requirements for latency and bandwidth may
        require changes in the provisioning of the underlying L2 protocols. A
        technician may initiate a query/response session or bulk transfer to
        diagnose or configure a field device. A level sensor device may need
        to perform a calibration and send a bulk file to a plant. The routing
        protocol MUST route on paths that are changed to appropriately
        provision the application requirements. The routing protocol MUST
        support the ability to recompute paths based on underlying link
        attributes/metric that may change dynamically.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Different Routes for Different Flows">
        <t>Because different services categories have different service
        requirements, it is often desirable to have different routes for
        different data flows between the same two endpoints. For example,
        alarm or periodic data from A to Z may require path diversity with
        specific latency and reliability. A file transfer between A and Z may
        not need path diversity. The routing algorithm MUST be able to
        generate different routes with different characteritics (e.g.
        Optimized according to different cost, etc...).</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Reliability Requirements">
      <t>LLN reliability constitutes several unrelated aspects: <list
          counter="relreqs" hangIndent="4" style="format %d)">
          <t>Availability of source to destination connectivity when the
          application needs it, expressed in number of succeses / number of
          attempts</t>

          <t>Availability of source to destination connectivity when the
          application might need it, expressed in number of potential failures
          / available bandwidth,</t>

          <t>Ability, expressed in number of successes divided by number of
          attempts to get data delivered from source to destination within a
          capped time,</t>

          <t>How well a network (serving many applications) achieves
          end-to-end delivery of packets within a bounded latency</t>

          <t>Trustworthiness of data that is delivered to the sinks.</t>

          <t>...</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This makes quantifying reliability the equivalent of plotting it on a
      three plus dimensional graph. Different applications have different
      requirements, and expressing reliability as a one dimensional parameter,
      like 'reliability my wireless network is 99.9%' is often creating more
      confusion than clarity.</t>

      <t>The impact of not receiving sensor data due to sporadic network
      outages can be devastating if this happens unnoticed. However, if
      destinations that expect periodic sensor data or alarm status updates,
      fail to get them, then automatically these systems can take appropriate
      actions that prevent dangerous situations. Pending the wireless
      application, appropriate action ranges from initiating a shut down
      within 100 ms, to using a last known good value for as much as N
      successive samples, to sending out an operator into the plant to collect
      monthly data in the conventional way, i.e. some portable sensor, paper
      and a clipboard.</t>

      <t>The impact of receiving corrupted data, and not being able to detect
      that received data is corrupt, is often more dangerous. Data corruption
      can either come from random bit errors, so white noise, or from
      occasional bursty interference sources like thunderstorms or leaky
      microwave ovens, but also from conscious attacks by adversaries.</t>

      <t>Another critical aspect for the routing is the capability to ensure
      maximum disruption time and route maintainance. The maximum disruption
      time is the time it takes at most for a specific path to be restored
      when broken. Route maintainance ensures that a path is monitored to be
      restored when broken within the maximum disruption time. Maintenance
      should also ensure that a path continues to provide the service for
      which it was established for instance in terms of bandwidth, jitter and
      latency.</t>

      <t>In industrial applications, availability is usually defined with
      respect to end-to-end delivery of packets within a bounded latency.
      availability requirements vary over many orders of magnitude. Some
      non-critical monitoring applications may tolerate a availability of less
      than 90% with hours of latency. Most industrial standards, such as
      HART7, have set user availability expectations at 99.9%. Regulatory
      requirements are a driver for some industrial applications. Regulatory
      monitoring requires high data integrity because lost data is assumed to
      be out of compliance and subject to fines. This can drive up either
      availability, or thrustworthiness requirements.</t>

      <t>Because LLN link stability is often low, path diversity is critical.
      Hop-by-hop link diversity is used to improve latency-bounded
      reliability. Additionally, bicasting or pluricasting may be used over
      multiple non congruent / non overlapping paths to increase the
      likelihood that at least one instance of a critical packet be delivered
      error free.</t>

      <t>Because data from field devices are aggregated and funneled at the
      LLN access point before they are routed to plant applications, LLN
      access point redundancy is an important factor in overall availability.
      A route that connects a field device to a plant application may have
      multiple paths that go through more than one LLN access point. The
      routing protocol MUST be able to compute paths towards different
      destinations so as to perform load balancing across a variety of
      paths. The availability of each path in a
      multipath route can change over time. Hence, it is important to measure
      the availability on a per-path basis and select a path (or paths)
      according to the availability requirements.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Device-Aware Routing Requirements">
      <t>Wireless LLN nodes in industrial environments are powered by a
      variety of sources. Battery operated devices with lifetime requirements
      of at least five years are the most common. Battery operated devices
      have a cap on their total energy, and typically can report an estimate
      of remaining energy, and typically do not have constraints on the
      short-term average power consumption. Energy scavenging devices are more
      complex. These systems contain both a power scavenging device (such as
      solar, vibration, or temperature difference) and an energy storage
      device, such as a rechargeable battery or a capacitor. These systems,
      therefore, have limits on both long-term average power consumption
      (which cannot exceed the average scavenged power over the same interval)
      as well as the short-term limits imposed by the energy storage
      requirements. For solar- powered systems, the energy storage system is
      generally designed to provide days of power in the absence of sunlight.
      Many industrial sensors run off of a 4-20 mA current loop, and can
      scavenge on the order of milliwatts from that source. Vibration
      monitoring systems are a natural choice for vibration scavenging, which
      typically only provides tens or hundreds of microwatts. Due to
      industrial temperature ranges and desired lifetimes, the choices of
      energy storage devices can be limited, and the resulting stored energy
      is often comparable to the energy cost of sending or receiving a packet
      rather than the energy of operating the node for several days. And of
      course, some nodes will be line-powered.</t>

      <t>Example 1: solar panel, lead-acid battery sized for two weeks of
      rain.</t>

      <t>Example 2: vibration scavenger, 1mF tantalum capacitor.</t>

      <t>Field devices have limited resources. Low-power, low-cost devices
      have limited memory for storing route information. Typical field devices
      will have a finite number of routes they can support for their embedded
      sensor/actuator application and for forwarding other devices packets in
      a mesh network slotted-link.</t>

      <t>Users may strongly prefer that the same device have different
      lifetime requirements in different locations. A sensor monitoring a
      non-critical parameter in an easily accessed location may have a
      lifetime requirement that is shorter and tolerate more statistical
      variation than a mission-critical sensor in a hard-to-reach place that
      requires a plant shutdown in order to replace.</t>

      <t>The routing algorithm MUST support node-constrained routing (e.g.
      taking into account the existing energy state as a node constraint).
      Node constraints include power and memory, as well as constraints placed
      on the device by the user, such as battery life.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Broadcast/Multicast">
      <t>Some existing industrial plant applications do not use broadcast or
      multicast addressing to communicate to field devices. Unicast address
      support is sufficient for them.</t>

      <t>In some other industrial process automation environments, multicast
      over IP is used to deliver to multiple nodes that may be
      functionally-similar or not. Example usages are: <list counter="mul"
          hangIndent="4" style="format %d)">
          <t>Delivery of alerts to multiple similar servers in an automation
          control room. Alerts are multicast to a group address based on the
          part of the automation process where the alerts arose (e.g., the
          multicast address
          "all-nodes-interested-in-alerts-for-process-unit-X"). This is always
          a restricted-scope multicast, not a broadcast</t>

          <t>Delivery of common packets to multiple routers over a backbone,
          where the packets results in each receiving router initiating
          multicast (sometimes as a full broadcast) within the LLN. For
          instance, This can be a byproduct of having potentially physically
          separated backbone routers that can inject messages into different
          portions of the same larger LLN.</t>

          <t>Publication of measurement data to more than one subscriber. This
          feature is useful in some peer to peer control applications. For
          example, level position may be useful to a controller that operates
          the flow valve and also to the overfill alarm indicator. Both
          controller and alarm indicator would receive the same publication
          sent as a multicast by the level gauge.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Both of these uses require an 1:N security mechanism as well; they
      aren't of any use if the end-to-end security is only point-to-point.</t>

      <t>It is quite possible that first-generation wireless automation field
      networks can be adequately useful without either of these capabilities,
      but in the near future, wireless field devices with communication
      controllers and protocol stacks will require control and configuration,
      such as firmware downloading, that may benefit from broadcast or
      multicast addressing.</t>

      <t>The routing protocol SHOULD support broadcast or multicast
      addressing.</t>

    <section title="Route Establishment Time">
      <t>During network formation, installers with no networking skill must be
      able to determine if their devices are “in the network” with sufficient
      connectivity to perform their function. Installers will have sufficient
      skill to provision the devices with a sample rate or activity profile.
      The routing algorithm MUST find the appropriate route(s) and report
      success or failure within several minutes, and SHOULD report success or
      failure within tens of seconds.</t>

      <t>Network connectivity in real deployments is always time varying, with
      time constants from seconds to months. So long as the underlying
      connectivity has not been compromised, this link churn should not
      substantially affect network operation. The routing algorithm MUST
      respond to normal link failure rates with routes that meet the Service
      requirements (especially latency) throughout the routing response. The
      routing algorithm SHOULD always be in the process of recalculating the
      route in response to changing link statistics. The routing algorithm
      MUST recalculate the paths when field devices change due to insertion,
      removal or failure, and this recalculation MUST NOT cause latencies
      greater than the specified constraints (typically seconds to
      minutes).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Mobility">
      <t>Various economic factors have contributed to a reduction of trained
      workers in the plant. The industry as a whole appears to be trying to
      solve this problem with what is called the "wireless worker". Carrying a
      PDA or something similar, this worker will be able to accomplish more
      work in less time than the older, better-trained workers that he or she
      replaces. Whether the premise is valid, the use case is commonly
      presented: the worker will be wirelessly connected to the plant IT
      system to download documentation, instructions, etc., and will need to
      be able to connect "directly" to the sensors and control points in or
      near the equipment on which he or she is working. It is possible that
      this "direct" connection could come via the normal LLNs data collection
      network. This connection is likely to require higher bandwidth and lower
      latency than the normal data collection operation.</t>

      <t>Undecided yet is if these PDAs will use the LLN network directly to
      talk to field sensors, or if they will rather use other wireless
      connectivity that proxys back into the field, or to anywhere else, the
      user interfaces typically used for plant historians, asset management
      systems, and the likes.</t>

      <t>The routing protocol SHOULD support the wireless worker with fast
      network connection times of a few of seconds, and low command and
      response latencies to the plant behind the LLN access points, to
      applications, and to field devices. The routing protocol SHOULD also
      support the bandwidth allocation for bulk transfers between the field
      device and the handheld device of the wireless worker. The routing
      protocol SHOULD support walking speeds for maintaining network
      connectivity as the handheld device changes position in the wireless
      network.</t>

      <t>Some field devices will be mobile. These devices may be located on
      moving parts such as rotating components or they may be located on
      vehicles such as cranes or fork lifts. The routing protocol SHOULD
      support vehicular speeds of up to 35 kmph.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Manageability ">
      <t>The process and control industry is manpower constrained. The aging
      demographics of plant personnel are causing a looming manpower problem
      for industry across many markets. The goal for the industrial networks
      is to have the installation process not require any new skills for the
      plant personnel. The person would install the wireless sensor or
      wireless actuator the same way the wired sensor or wired actuator is
      installed, except the step to connect wire is eliminated.</t>

      <t>Most users in fact demand even much further simplified provisioning
      methods, whereby automatically any new device will connect and report at
      the LLN access point. This requires availability of open and untrusted
      side channels for new joiners, and it requires strong and automated
      authentication so that networks can automatically accept or reject new
      joiners. Ideally, for a user, adding new devices should be as easy as
      dragging and dropping an icon from a pool of authenticated new joiners
      into a pool for the wired domain that this new sensor should connect to.
      Under the hood, invisible to the user, auditable security mechanisms
      should take care of new device authentication, and secret join key
      distribution. These more sophisticated 'over the air' secure
      provisioning methods should eliminate the use of traditional
      configuration tools for setting up devices prior to being ready to
      securely join a LLN access point.</t>

      <t>There will be many new applications where even without any human
      intervention at the plant, devices that have never been on site before,
      should be allowed, based on their credentials and crypto capabilities,
      to connect anyway. Examples are 3rd party road tankers, rail cargo
      containers with overfill protection sensors, or consumer cars that need
      to be refueled with hydrogen by robots at future petrol stations.</t>

      <t>The routing protocol for LLNs is expected to be easy to deploy and
      manage. Because the number of field devices in a network is large,
      provisioning the devices manually may not make sense. Therefore, the
      routing protocol MUST support auto-provisioning of field devices. The
      protocol also MUST support the distribution of configuration from a
      centralized management controller if operator-initiated configuration
      change is allowed.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security">
      <t>Given that wireless sensor networks in industrial automation operate
      in systems that have substantial financial and human safety
      implications, security is of considerable concern. Levels of security
      violation that are tolerated as a "cost of doing business" in the
      banking industry are not acceptable when in some cases literally
      thousands of lives may be at risk.</t>

      <t>Security is easily confused with guarantee for availability. When
      discussing wireless security, it's important to distinguish clearly
      between the risks of temporary losing connectivity, say due to a
      thunderstorm, and the risks associated with knowledgeable adversaries
      attacking a wireless system. The conscious attacks need to be split
      between 1) attacks on the actual application served by the wireless
      devices and 2) attacks that exploit the presence of a wireless access
      point that may provide connectivity onto legacy wired plant networks, so
      attacks that have little to do with the wireless devices in the LLNs.
      The second type of attack, access points that might be wireless
      backdoors that may allow an attacker outside the fence to access
      typically non-secured process control and/or office networks, are
      typically the ones that do create exposures where lives are at risk.
      This implies that the LLN access point on its own must possess
      functionality that guarantees domain segregation, and thus prohibits
      many types of traffic further upstream.</t>

      <t>Current generation industrial wireless device manufactures are
      specifying security at the MAC layer and the transport layer. A shared
      key is used to authenticate messages at the MAC layer. At the transport
      layer, commands are encrypted with unique randomly-generated end-to-end
      Session keys. HART7 and ISA100.11a are examples of security systems for
      industrial wireless networks.</t>

      <t>Although such symmetric key encryption and authentication mechanisms
      at MAC and transport layers may protect reasonably well during the
      lifecycle, the initial network boot (provisioning) step in many cases
      requires more sophisticated steps to securely land the initial secret
      keys in field devices. It is vital that also during these steps, the
      ease of deployment and the freedom of mixing and matching products from
      different suppliers does not complicate life for those that deploy and
      commission. Given average skill levels in the field, and given serious
      resource constraints in the market, investing a little bit more in
      sensor node hardware and software so that new devices automatically can
      be deemed trustworthy, and thus automatically join the domains that they
      should join, with just one drag and drop action for those in charge of
      deploying, will yield in faster adoption and proliferation of the LLN
      technology.</t>

      <t>Industrial plants may not maintain the same level of physical
      security for field devices that is associated with traditional network
      sites such as locked IT centers. In industrial plants it must be assumed
      that the field devices have marginal physical security and might be
      compromised. The routing protocol SHOULD limit the risk incurred by one
      node being compromised, for instance by proposing non congruent path for
      a given route and balancing the traffic across the network.</t>

      <t>The routing protocol SHOULD compartmentalize the trust placed in
      field devices so that a compromised field device does not destroy the
      security of the whole network. The routing MUST be configured and
      managed using secure messages and protocols that prevent outsider
      attacks and limit insider attacks from field devices installed in
      insecure locations in the plant.</t>

      <t>Wireless typically forces abandonance of classical 'by perimeter'
      thinking when trying to secure network domains. Wireless nodes in LLN
      networks should thus be regarded as little islands with trusted kernels,
      situated in an ocean of untrusted connectivity, an ocean that might be
      full of pirate ships. Consequently, confidence in node identity and
      ability to challenge authenticity of source node credentials gets more
      relevant. Cryptographic boundaries inside devices that clearly demark
      the border between trusted and untrusted areas need to be drawn.
      Protection against compromise of the cryptographic boundaries inside the
      hardware of devices is outside of the scope this document.</t>
