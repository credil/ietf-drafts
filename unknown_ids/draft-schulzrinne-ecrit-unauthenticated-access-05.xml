         <t>The IETF emergency services architecture assumes that the calling device has acquired
            rights to use the access network or that no authentication is required for the access
            network, such as for public wireless access points. Subsequent protocol interactions,
            such as obtaining location information, learning the address of the Public Safety
            Answering Point (PSAP) and the emergency call itself are largely decoupled from the
            underlying network access procedures.</t>
         <t>In some cases, the device does not have credentials for network access, does not have a
            VoIP provider, or the credentials have become invalid, e.g., because the user has
            exhausted their prepaid balance or the account has expired. </t>
         <t>This document provides a problem statement, introduces terminology and describes an
            extension for the base IETF emergency services architecture to address these scenarios.

      <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
         <t> Summoning police, the fire department or an ambulance in emergencies is one of the
            fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone. As telephone functionality moves
            from circuit-switched telephony to Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that
            this core functionality will continue to work at least as well as it has for the older
            technology. New devices and services are being made available that could be used to make
            a request for help, which are not traditional telephones, and users are increasingly
            expecting them to be used to place emergency calls. </t>
         <t> Roughly speaking, the IETF emergency services architecture (see <xref
               target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework"/>)
            divides responsibility for handling emergency calls between the access network (ISP),
            the VoIP service provider (VSP) and the provider of emergency signaling services, the
            emergency service network (ESN). The access network may provide location information to
            end systems, but does not have to provide any VoIP signaling functionality. The
            emergency caller can reach the ESN either directly or through the VoIP provider's
            outbound proxy. Any of the three parties can provide the mapping from location to PSAP
            URI by offering LoST <xref target="RFC5222"/> services.</t>

         <t> In general, a set of automated configuration mechanisms allows a device to function in
            a variety of architectures, without the user being aware of the details on who provides
            location, mapping services or call routing services. However, if emergency calling is to
            be supported when the calling device lacks access network authorization or does not have
            a VoIP provider, one or more of the providers may need to provide additional services
            and functions. </t>
         <t> In all cases, the end device MUST be able to perform a LoST lookup and otherwise
            conduct the emergency call in the same manner as when the three exceptional conditions
            discussed below do not apply.</t>
         <t> We distinguish between three conditions: </t>
         <t>
            <list style="hanging">
               <t hangText="No access authorization (NAA):"> The current access network requires
                  access authorization and the caller does not have valid user credentials. (This
                  includes the case where the access network allows pay-per-use, as is common for
                  wireless hotspots, but there is insufficient time to pay for access.) <vspace
                     blankLines="1"/></t>
               <t hangText="
               No VoIP provider (NVP):"> The caller does not have a
                  VoIP service provider (VSP) at the time of the call. <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
               <t hangText="Zero-balance VoIP provider (ZBP):"> The caller has valid credentials
                  with a VSP, but is not allowed to place calls, e.g., because the user has a zero
                  balance in a prepaid account.<vspace blankLines="1"/>
               </t>
            </list>
         </t>
         <t>A user may well suffer from both NAA and NVP or ZBP at the same time. Depending on local
            policy and regulations, it may not be possible to place emergency calls in the NAA case.
            Unless local regulations require user identification, it should always be possible to
            place calls in the NVP case, with minimal impact on the ISP. Unless the ESN requires
            that all calls traverse a known set of VSPs, a caller should be able to place an
            emergency call in the ZBP case. We discuss each case in separate sections below. </t>



         <section title="No Access Authorization (NAA)">
            <t> In the NAA (No Access Authorization) case, the emergency caller does not posses
               valid credentials for the access network. If local regulations or policy allows or
               require, the access network may or needs to cooperate in providing emergency calling
               services. Generally, the ISP will want to ensure that devices do not pretend to place
               emergency calls, but then abuse the access for obtaining more general services
               fraudulently. </t>
            <t> In particular, the ISP MUST allow emergency callers to acquire an IP address and to
               reach a LoST server, either provided by the ISP or some third party. It SHOULD also
               provide location information via one of the mechanisms specified in <xref
                  target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"/> without requiring authorization unless it can
               safely assume that all nodes in the access network can determine their own location,
               e.g., via GPS.</t>

            <t> The details of how filtering is performed depends on the details of the ISP
               architecture and are beyond the scope of this document. We illustrate a possible
               model. If the ISP runs its own LoST server, it would maintain an access control list
               including all IP addresses contained in responses returned by the LoST server, as
               well as the LoST server itself. (It may need to translate the domain names returned
               to IP addresses and hope that the resolution captures all possible DNS responses.)
               Since the media destination addresses are not predictable, the ISP also has to
               provide a SIP outbound proxy so that it can determine the media addresses and add
               those to the filter list. </t>
         </section>
         <section title="No VoIP Service Provider (NVP)">
            <t> In the second case, the emergency caller has no current VoIP service provider (VSP).
               This case poses no particular difficulties unless it is assumed that only VSPs
               provide LoST server or that ESNs only accept calls that reach it through a set of
               known VSPs. However, since the calling device cannot obtain configuration information
               from its VSP, the ISP MUST provide the address of a LoST server via DHCP <xref
                  target="RFC5223"/> if this model is to be supported. The LoST server may be
               operated either by the ISP or a third party. </t>
         </section>

         <section title="Zero-Balance VoIP Service Provider (ZBP)">

            <t> In the case of zero-balance VoIP service provider, the VSP can authenticate the
               caller, but the caller is not authorized to place regular VoIP calls, e.g., because
               the contract has expired or the prepaid account for the customer has been depleted.
               Naturally, a VSP can simply disallow access by such customers, so that all such
               customers find themselves in the NVP situation described above. If VSPs desire or are
               required by regulation to provide emergency calling services to such customers, they
               need to provide LoST services to such customers and may need to provide outbound SIP
               proxy services. As usual, the calling device looks up the LoST server via SIP
               configuration. </t>
            <t> Unless the emergency call traverses a PSTN gateway or the VSP charges for IP-to-IP
               calls, there is little potential for fraud. If the VSP also operates the LoST server,
               the outbound proxy MAY restrict outbound calls to the SIP URIs returned by the LoST
               server. It is NOT RECOMMENDED to rely on a fixed list of SIP URIs, as that list may
               change. </t>

      <section title="A Warning Note">
         <t>At the time of writing there is no regulation in place that demands the functionality
            described in this memo. SDOs have started their work on this subject in a proactive
            fashion in the anticipation that national regulation will demand it for a subset of
            network environments.</t>
         <t>There are also indications that the functionality of unauthenticated emergency calls
            (called SIM-less calls) in today's cellular system in certain countries leads to a fair
            amount of hoaks or test calls. This causes overload situations at PSAPs with .</t>

               <t>As an example, Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM, Switzerland) provided
                  statistics about 112 calls in Switzerland from Jan. 1997 to Nov. 2001. Switzerland
                  did not offer SIM-less emergency calls except for almost a month in July 2000
                  where a significant increase in hoaks and test calls was reported. As a

               <t hangText="Non-Service-Initialized Device:"><vspace blankLines="1"/> A device for
                  which there is no valid service contract with a provider of the services. Other
                  terms: "un-activated", "un-provisioned", or "unbranded" device. <vspace
                     blankLines="1"/></t>

               <t hangText="Unauthenticated Emergency Service:">
                  <vspace blankLines="1"/> The term "unauthenticated emergency services" refers to
                  the case where an emergency caller does not have credentials (e.g., no SIM card,
                  no username and password, no private key) to successfully complete network access
                  authentication procedures or to use a VoIP service or both. <vspace blankLines="1"
                  /> The case of no credentials for network access is likely case in enterprise
                  networks, home networks, or governmental networks. In other cases the user might
                  be able to obtain such credentials, for example in hotspots found in hotels, at
                  airports, and in many coffee shops. Unfortunately, users have to go through a
                  lengthy procedure (often involving captive portals) to obtain a temporary account
                  in exchange of money. In emergency situations it is certainly not desirable to let
                  the user find their way through a number of webpages and to type-in their credit
                  card details. <vspace blankLines="1"/> It is important to differentiate between
                  the unavailability of credentials for network access and for VoIP access as the
                  network provider and the VoIP provider are often distinct entities and therefore
                  the user might have different credentials with the two. <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

               <t hangText="Unauthorized Emergency Service:">
                  <vspace blankLines="1"/> The term "unauthorized emergency services" refers to the
                  case where a device aims to attach to the network or to use a VoIP service but the
                  authorization procedure fails. The authorization step may fail as a consequence of
                  triggering different procedures (such as network access authentication or
                  registration at the VoIP providers registrar). Still, the device is granted
                  (limited) access to perform emergency calling. It is important to differentiate
                  between network operator and VoIP provider as they often refer to different
                  parties and therefore the authorization decision might be executed by a different
                  backend infrastructure. <vspace blankLines="1"/> Lack of authorization might be
                  caused by a number of reasons, including credit exhaustion, expired accounts,
                  locked account, missing access rights (e.g., access to the competitors enterprise

               <t>The end host MUST use a Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) supported by the IAP

         title="Considerations for ISPs to support Unauthenticated Emergency Services with Architecture Extensions">
         <t>For unauthenticated emergency services support it is insufficient to provide mechanisms
            only at the link layer in order to bypass authentication for the cases when:</t>
         <t>
            <list style="symbols">
               <t>the IAP/ISP does not support any Location Configuration Protocol</t>
               <t>the IAP/ISP does not have knowledge of a LoST server (which would assist the
                  client to find the correct PSAP)</t>
            </list>
         </t>


         <t> A modification to the emergency services architecture is necessary since the IAP and
            the ISP need to make sure that the claimed emergency caller indeed performs an emergency
            call rather than using the network for other purposes, and thereby acting fraudulent by
            skipping any authentication, authorization and accounting procedures. Hence, without
            introducing some understanding of the specific application the ISP (and consequently the
            IAP) will not be able to detect and filter malicious activities. This leads to the
            architecture described in <xref target="arch-fig"/> where the IAP needs to implement
            extensions to link layer procedures for unauthenticated emergency service access and the
            ISP needs to deploy emergency services related entities used for call routing, such as
            the Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP), a Location Configuration Server (LCS) and a
            mapping database.</t>

         <t>On a very high-level, the interaction is as follows starting with the end host not being
            attached to the network and the user starting to make an emergency call. </t>
         <t>
            <list style="symbols">
               <!--          <t>With the exchange shown in (1) a link layer device, such as base stations and access
            points, advertise their capability, for example using link layer beacons, to allow
            unauthenticated emergency service network access. </t>
-->
               <t>Some radio networks have added support for unauthenticated emergency access, some
                  other type of networks advertise these capabilities using layer beacons. The end
                  host learns about these unauthenticated emergency services capabilities either
                  from the link layer type or from advertisement. </t>
               <t>The end host uses the link layer specific network attachment procedures defined
                  for unauthenticated network access in order to get access to emergency services.</t>
               <!--
          <t>The end host executes an EAP method that is suitable for unauthenticated network access
            that does not require client-side authentication.</t>
          -->
               <t>When the link layer network attachment procedure is completed the end host learns
                  basic configuration information using DHCP from the ISP, including the address of
                  the ESRP, as shown in (2).</t>
               <t>When the IP address configuration is completed then the SIP UA initiates a SIP
                  INVITE towards the indicated ESRP, as shown in (3). The INVITE message contains
                  all the necessary parameters required by <xref target="sip-client"/>.</t>
               <t>The ESRP receives the INVITE and processes it according to the description in
                     <xref target="esrp-sip"/>. The location of the end host may need to be
                  determined using a protocol interaction shown in (4).</t>
               <t>Potentially, an interaction between the LCS of the ISP and the LCS of the IAP may
                  be necessary, see (5).</t>
               <t>Finally, the correct PSAP for the location of the end host has to be evaluated,
                  see (6).</t>
               <t>The ESRP routes the call to the PSAP, as shown in (7).</t>
               <t>The PSAP evaluates the initial INVITE and aims to complete the call setup. </t>
               <t>Finally, when the call setup is completed media traffic can be exchanged between
                  the PSAP and the emergency caller.</t>
            </list>
         </t>
         <t>For editorial reasons the end-to-end SIP and media exchange between the PSAP and SIP UA
            are not shown in <xref target="arch-fig"/>.</t>

         <t>Two important aspects are worth to highlight: </t>
         <t>
            <list style="symbols">
               <t>The IAP/ISP needs to understand the concept of emergency calls and the SIP profile
                  described in this document. No other VoIP protocol profile, such as XMPP, Skype,
                  etc., are supported for emergency calls in this particular architecture. Other
                  profiles may be added in the future, but the deployment effort is enormous since
                  they have to be universally deployed. </t>
               <t>The end host has no obligation to determine location information. It may attach
                  location information if it has location available (e.g., from a GPS receiver).</t>
            </list>

         </t>
         <t><xref target="arch-fig"/> shows that the ISP needs to deploy SIP-based emergency
            services functionality. It is important to note that the ISP itself may outsource the
            functionality by simply providing access to them (e.g., it puts the IP address of an
            ESRP or a LoST server into an allow-list). For editorial reasons this outsourcing is not
            shown.</t>

               <t>The ESRP acts a location recipient and the usage of HELD <xref
                     target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery"/> with the identity extensions
                     <xref target="I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-identity-extensions"/> may be a
                  possible choice. The ESRP would thereby act as a HELD client and the corresponding
                  LIS at the ISP as the HELD server.</t>

               <t>The ESRP needs to obtain enough information to route the call. The ESRP itself,
                  however, does not necessarily need to process location information obtained via
                  HELD since it may be used as input to LoST to obtain the PSAP URI.</t>

            The exact detail of the location information that needs to be understood by the ESRP for determining 
            the route towards the PSAP depends on the specifics of the emergency services infrastructure in the 
            corresponding country. For some countries it is sufficient almost no location information needs to be
            understood to correctly route the call. For a generic solution, however, it is important 
              for the ESRP (or an associated entity making location information available to the PSAP)
              MUST understand the PIDF-LO format <xref target="RFC4119"/>, the PIDF-LO profile <xref
                target="I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile"/> and the revised civic format <xref
                  target="RFC5139"/>.

      <section title="Security Considerations">
         <t>The security threats discussed in <xref target="RFC5069"/> are applicable to this
            document. A number of security vulnerabilities discussed in <xref
               target="I-D.barnes-geopriv-lo-sec"/> around faked location information are less
            problematic in this case since location information does not need to be provided by the
            end host itself or it can be verified to fall within a specific geographical area. </t>
         <t>There are a couple of new vulnerabilities raised with unauthenticated emergency services
            since the PSAP operator does is not in possession of any identity information about the
            emergency call via the signaling path itself. In countries where this functionality is
            used for GSM networks today this has lead to a significant amount of misuse. </t>
         <t>The link layer mechanisms need to provide a special way of handling unauthenticated
            emergency services. Although this subject is not a topic for the IETF itself but there
            are at least a few high-level assumptions that may need to be collected. This includes
            security features that may be desirable. </t>
