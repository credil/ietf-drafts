               Auto-Configuration in Virtual Aggregation
                     draft-ietf-grow-va-auto-02.txt

Abstract

   Virtual Aggregation as specified in [I-D.ietf-grow-va] requires
   configuration of a static "VP-List" on all routers.  The VP-List
   allows routers to know which prefixes may or may not be FIB-
   installed.  This draft specified an optional method of determining
   this that requires far less configuration.  Specifically, it requires
   the configuration of a "VP-Range" in ASBRs connected to transit and
   peer ISPs.  An Extended Communities Attribute is used to convey to
   other routers that a given route can be FIB-suppressed.

Internet-Draft               VA Auto Config                  August 2010


1.  Introduction

   As the current VA specification stands ([I-D.ietf-grow-va]), routers
   have to know which prefixes they must FIB-install and and which they
   need not FIB-install.  The VP-List tells them this: they must FIB-
   install routes to Virtual Prefixes (VP), and they need not FIB-
   install routes to prefixes that fall within VPs for which they are
   not an Aggregation Point Router (APR).  The same VP-List must be
   installed in every router.

   This draft specifies an optional alternative to the VP-List that
   requires far less configuration.  Specifically, a list of one or more
   "VP-Ranges" is configured in ASBRs --- typically ASBRs that do not
   connect to customer networks.  These ASBRs then simply tag routes as
   to whether the route can be suppressed.  This is simpler than the
   current configured VP-List approach in two regards.  First, fewer
   routers need to be configured.  Second, the VP-Range is simpler than
   the VP-List.  In most cases, once an ISP is past its initial VA roll-
   out phase, the VP-Range consists of a single 0/0 entry.

   This draft uses terms defined in [I-D.ietf-grow-va].

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Specification

   With the "VP-Range" approach to determining suppressability, certain
   ASBRs are designated as "tagging routers".  Tagging routers
   explicitly tag routes with an Extended Communities Attribute that
   indicates whether the route can be FIB-suppressed.  All ASBRs that
   connect to one or more transit provider ISPs MUST be tagging routers.
   ASBRs that connect to one or more peer ISPs SHOULD be tagging
   routers.  ASBRs that connect to customer networks SHOULD NOT be
   tagging routers.

   Tagging routers are configured with a "VP-Range" list.  This consists
   of the ranges of IP address that are collectively covered by all VPs
   in the AS.  In a mature deployment of VA, the range would amount to
   all IP addresses, in which case the VP-Range is simply 0/0.  Early in
   VA deployment, when an ISP is still in the testing or roll-out phase,
   the VP-Range may consist of multiple entries.

   Tagging routers SHOULD tag any route whose prefix falls within the

   VP-Range with a "can-suppress" tag, with the following exceptions:

   1.  Tagging routers MUST NOT tag VP routes with can-suppress (where a
       VP route is that route to the VP that the router originates in
       its role as an APR).
   2.  If the ISP has a policy of FIB-installing customer routes, then
       routes received from customers SHOULD NOT be tagged with can-
       suppress.

   The can-suppress tag itself is an Extended Communities Attribute
   [RFC4360] to be assigned by IANA.  The Transitive Bit MUST be set to
   value 1 (the community is non-transitive across ASes).

   Routers install or suppress FIB entries according to the following
   rules.  Note that tagging routers conceptually follow these rules
   after tagging (or not tagging) the route.  Note also that these rules
   apply only to the route used by the router as the best route.  In
   other words, if a router receives two routes for the same prefix, and
   one route is tagged can-suppress and the other is not, the router
   follows these rules only with respect to the route that it selects as
   the best route.

   1.  Routes without the can-suppress tag MUST be FIB-installed.
   2.  APRs MUST FIB-install routes for sub-prefixes that fall within
       the APR's VPs, whether or not the route is tagged can-suppress.
   3.  Otherwise, routers MAY FIB-suppress routes tagged as can-
       suppress.


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA must assign type values for the Extended Communities Attributes
   that convey the tags.


4.  Security Considerations

   As of this writing, there are no known new security threats
   introduced by this draft.
