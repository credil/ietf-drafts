Internet-Draft         IPv6 Configuration in IKEv2             June 2007


Abstract

   When IKEv2 is used for remote VPN access (client to VPN gateway), the
   gateway assigns the client an IP address from the internal network
   using IKEv2 configuration payloads.  The configuration payloads
   specified in RFC 4306 work well for IPv4, but make it difficult to
   use certain features of IPv6.  This document describes the
   limitations of current IKEv2 configuration payloads for IPv6, and
   explores possible solutions that would allow IKEv2 to set up full-
   featured virtual IPv6 interfaces.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 Configuration in IKEv2             June 2007


1.  Introduction and Problem Statement

   In typical remote access VPN use (client to VPN gateway), the client
   needs an IP address in the network protected by the security gateway.
   IKEv2 includes a feature called "configuration payloads" that allows
   the gateway to dynamically assign a temporary address to the client
   [IKEv2].

   For IPv4, the message exchange would look as follows:

      Client      Gateway
     --------    ---------

      HDR(IKE_SA_INIT), SAi1, KEi, Ni  -->

               <--  HDR(IKE_SA_INIT), SAr1, KEr, Nr, [CERTREQ]

      HDR(IKE_AUTH),
      SK { IDi, CERT, [CERTREQ], AUTH, [IDr],
           CP(CFG_REQUEST) =
              { INTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS(),
                INTERNAL_IP4_DNS() }, SAi2,
           TSi = (0, 0-65535, 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255),
           TSr = (0, 0-65535, 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255) }  -->

             <--  HDR(IKE_AUTH),
                  SK { IDr, CERT, AUTH,
                       CP(CFG_REPLY) =
                          { INTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS(192.0.1.234),
                            INTERNAL_IP4_DNS(10.11.22.33) },
                       SAr2,
                       TSi = (0, 0-65535, 192.0.1.234-192.0.1.234),
                       TSr = (0, 0-65535, 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255) }

                       Figure 1: IPv4 configuration

   The IPv4 case has been implemented by various vendors, and in general
   works well.  IKEv2 also defines almost identical configuration
   payloads for IPv6:

                       Figure 2: IPv6 configuration

   In other words, IPv6 is basically treated as IPv4 with larger
   addresses.  As noted in [RFC4718], this does not fully follow the
   "normal IPv6 way of doing things".  The IPsec tunnels are not full-
   featured "interfaces" in the IPv6 addressing architecture [IPv6Addr]
   sense.  For example, they do not necessarily have link-local
   addresses, and this may complicate the use of protocols that assume
   them.

   This document describes what exactly are the limitations of current
   IKEv2 configuration payloads for IPv6, and explores possible
   solutions that would allow IKEv2-based VPNs to set up full-featured
   virtual IPv6 interfaces.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

   When messages containing IKEv2 payloads are described, optional
   payloads are shown in brackets (for instance, "[FOO]"), and a plus
   sign indicates that a payload can be repeated one or more times (for
   instance, "FOO+").

3.  Current Limitations

   This section explores the limitations of the current IPv6
   configuration mechanism.

   The IKEv2 specification does not always fully describe the semantics
   associated with configuration payloads, only their on-the-wire
   format.  This section assumes the semantics implied by Figure 2.  It
   is possible that many of the limitations described here could be
   solved by specifying additional semantics for these configuration
   payloads.

3.1.  Multiple Prefixes

   In Figure 2 only a single IPv6 address (from a single prefix) is
   assigned.  The specification does allow the client to include
   multiple INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS attributes in its request, but the
   gateway cannot assign more addresses than the client requested.

   Multiple prefixes are useful for site renumbering, host-based site
   multihoming [SHIM6], and unique local IPv6 addresses [RFC4193].  In
   all of these cases, the gateway has better information on how many
   different addresses (from different prefixes) the client should be
   assigned.

3.2.  Link-Local Addresses

   The IPv6 addressing architecture [IPv6Addr] specifies that "IPv6
   addresses of all types are assigned to interfaces, not nodes. [..]
   All interfaces are required to have at least one Link-Local unicast
   address".

   Currently, the virtual interface created by IKEv2 configuration
   payloads does not have link-local addresses.  This violates
   [IPv6Addr] and prevents the use of protocols that require link-local
   addresses, such as [MLDv2].

3.3.  Receiving Multicast Traffic

   Even if MLD would work, the traffic selectors negotiated in Figure 2
   do not allow receiving multicast traffic.

3.4.  Interface Identifier Selection

   In the message exchange shown in Figure 2, the gateway chooses the
   interface ID used by the client.  It is also possible for the client
   to request a specific interface ID; the gateway then chooses the
   prefix part.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 Configuration in IKEv2             June 2007


   This approach complicates the use of Cryptographically Generates
   Addresses [CGA].  With CGAs, the interface ID cannot be calculated
   before the prefix is known.  The client could first obtain a non-CGA
   address to determine the prefix, and then send a separate CFG_REQUEST
   to obtain a CGA address with the same prefix.  However, this approach
   requires that the IKEv2 software component provides an interface the
   component managing CGAs; an ugly implementation dependency that would
   be best avoided.

   Similar concerns apply to other cases where the client has some
   interest in what interface ID is being used, such as Hash-Based
   Addresses [HBA] and privacy addresses [RFC3041].

   Without CGAs and HBAs, VPN clients are not able to fully use IPv6
   features such as [SHIM6] or enhanced Mobile IPv6 route optimization
   [RFC4866].

3.5.  Sharing VPN Access

   Some VPN clients may want to share the VPN connection with other
   devices (e.g., from a cell phone to a laptop, or vice versa) via some
   local area network connection (such as Wireless LAN or Bluetooth).

   It is to be determined how common this use case would actually be;
   e.g., how likely it is that security policies would allow this.

   If sharing of VPN access is done, it is quite obviously easier if you
   get more than one address (which avoids NAT), and with DHCPv6 prefix
   delegation [RFC3633] you could even avoid [NDProxy].

4.  Design Goals

4.1.  Main Requirements

   o  Client can obtain a whole prefix, and use arbitrary Interface IDs
      without requiring IKEv2 signaling for each Interface ID.

   o  Client can be assigned multiple prefixes for use on the client-
      gateway link.  The client does not have to know beforehand how
      many prefixes are needed.

   o  (Optional/To be determined) Client can be assigned multiple
      prefixes for use on other links; e.g. the client could advertise
      these prefixes on a local WLAN link.  Gateway routes traffic to
      these prefixes to the client.

   o  The solution should avoid periodic messages over the VPN tunnel.

   o  The solution should avoid Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) over
      the VPN tunnel.

   o  Multicast works.  That is, the client is able to send multicast
      packets (tunneled to the gateway via unicast), join multicast
      groups using [MLDv2], and receive multicast packets (tunneled from
      the gateway to the client via unicast).

   o  Re-authentication works: the client can start a new IKE SA and
      continue using the same "virtual link" (with same addresses etc.).

   o  Compatibility with other IPsec uses: Configuring a virtual IPv6
      link should not prevent the peers from using IPsec/IKEv2 for other
      uses.

   o  Compatibility with current IPv6 configuration: Although the
      current IPv6 mechanism is not widely implemented, new solutions
      should not preclude its use (e.g., by defining incompatible
      semantics for the existing payloads).

   o  Compatibility with current IPv4 configuration: it should be
      possible to use the existing IPv4 configuration mechanism within
      the same IKE_SA.

4.2.  Desirable Non-Functional Properties

   o  Clean implementation dependencies.

   o  Re-use existing mechanisms, such as [AUTOCONF] and [DHCPv6] as
      much as possible; as explained in [IPConfig], creating IKEv2-

Internet-Draft         IPv6 Configuration in IKEv2             June 2007


      specific mechanisms should be avoided.

   o  Avoid the Not Invented Here (NIH) syndrome: There were several
      proposals how to do IP address configuration in IKEv2, and the
      IPsec WG chose one of them.  Any significant changes should be
      motivated by real technical needs, not by dislike of the proposal
      that was chosen.

4.3.  Non-Goals

   Mobile IPv6 already defines how it interacts with IPsec/IKEv2
   [RFC4877], and this document is not changing any of that.

5.  Solution Sketches

5.1.  Link Model

   Currently, the rest of this section assumes the point-to-point link
   model [Multilink].  In other words, the connection between the client
   and the VPN gateway is treated as a virtual point-to-point link, and
   prefixes assigned to this link are not shared with any other link
   (other VPN clients connected to the same gateway).

   Other possibilites (multi-access or NBMA) may need to be considered
   as well...

5.2.  Virtual Link Properties

   Assigning a new IPv6 address to the client creates a new "virtual"
   IPv6 interface, and "virtual link" between the client and the
   gateway.  The interface/link is created by some IKEv2 signaling, and
   it is destroyed once it is no longer used by any IKE_SA.  However:

   o  The link is not an IPsec SA; at any time, there can be zero or
      more IPsec SAs covering traffic on this link.

   o  The link is not a single IKE SA; to support reauthentication, it
      must be possible to identify the same link in another IKE SA.

   o  It is TBD whether a single IKE SA needs to support multiple
      virtual links.

   o  The link is not uniquely identified by the IKE peer identities
      (IDi and IDr) because IDi is often a user identity that can be
      used on multiple hosts at the same time.

   o  The link is not uniquely identified by the outer IP addresses of
      the peers (due to NAT Traversal and MOBIKE).

   o  Not all IPsec-protected traffic between the peers is necessarily
      related to the virtual link (although in the simplest VPN client-
      to-gateway scenario it will be).

5.3.  Discussion

   Reauthentication / virtual link identifier

      For reauthentication to work, we need an identifier that uniquely
      identifies the virtual link when the second IKE_SA is created.
      Some possible alternatives are the IKE SPIs of the IKE_SA where
      the virtual link was "created" (assuming we can't have multiple

Internet-Draft         IPv6 Configuration in IKEv2             June 2007


      virtual links within the same IKE_SA), a new identifier given at
      that time, or any unique prefix assigned to that link.

   Compatibility with other IPsec uses

      Compatibility with other IPsec uses probably requires that when a
      CHILD_SA is created, both peers can determine whether the CHILD_SA
      applies to the virtual interface (at the end of the virtual link),
      or the real interfaces IKEv2 messages are being sent over.
      Otherwise, things like traffic selector narrowing get tricky.  The
      simplest solution would be to add an extra payload to some
      CREATE_CHILD_SA requests, containing e.g. the virtual link
      identifier.

   Prefix assignment

      Prefixes could be assigned in IKEv2 messages or Router
      Advertisements sent inside the tunnel.  Both would work; both have
      some advantages.

   Duplicate Address Detection

      DAD can be avoided if the prefixes are not shared with any other
      link, and the VPN gateway does not configure any addresses from
      those prefixes (similar as in [IPv6PPP]).  But how does the client
      know this is the case?  We could specify that using some
      particular IKE payload always means this; or we could add a flag
      to some payload.

   Ingress filtering

      As with any other link (physical or virtual), the gateway would
      use ingress filtering to prevent address spoofing.  However, if
      the peer is also a router, the filters can allow other prefixes
      than those assigned to the virtual link.  Should these filters be
      visible in the traffic selectors negotiated inside IKE?

5.4.  First Sketch

   NOTE: this is still very preliminary, and may change completely!

   1) During IKE_AUTH, client sends a new Configuration Payload,
   INTERNAL_IP6_LINK that contains the Interface ID it will use
   for the link-local address (other addresses may use other
   Interface IDs).

   CP(CFG_REQUEST) =
      { INTERNAL_IP6_LINK(client_link_local_interface_id) }
   TSi = (0, 0-65535, 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 -
          FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)
   TSr = (0, 0-65535, 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 -
          FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)  -->

   The gateway replies with its own Interface ID for link-local address,
   and a new identifier for the virtual link.

   CP(CFG_REPLY) =
      { INTERNAL_IP6_LINK(link_id, gateway_link_local_interface_id) }
   TSi = (0, 0-65535, 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 -
          FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)
   TSr = (0, 0-65535, 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 -
          FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)

   At this point, both peers configure the virtual interface with the
   link-local addresses. (This step is pretty much based on [IPv6PPP])

   2) The next step is unicast prefix configuration; this is
   simply RS/RA sent over the IPsec SA (possibly followed by DHCPv6
   if RA had the M flag set).

   3) Creating and rekeying IPsec SAs: exchange initiator includes
   N(LINK_ID) notification in the CREATE_CHILD_SA request.
   The notification data contains the link_id.

   4) Reauthentication: when creating a new IKE_SA, client includes
   the link_id in INTERNAL_IP6_LINK CFG_REQUEST.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 Configuration in IKEv2             June 2007


8.  Acknowledgments

   The author would like to thank Mohan Parthasarathy and Yaron Sheffer
   for their valuable comments.

   Many of the challenges associated with IPsec-protected "virtual
   interfaces" have been identified before: for example, in the context
   of protecting IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels with IPsec [RFC4891], Provider
   Provisioned VPNs [VLINK] [RFC3884], and Mobile IPv6 [RFC4877].  Some
   of the limitations of assigning a single IPv6 address were identified
   in [RFC3314].
