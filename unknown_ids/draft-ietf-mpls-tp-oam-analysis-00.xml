      <t>This document analyzes the set of requirements for Operations, Administration, 
	  and Maintenance (OAM) for the Transport Profile of MPLS(MPLS-TP) as defined in 
	  <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"/>, to evaluate whether existing OAM tools (either 
	  from the current MPLS toolset or from the ITU-T documents) can be applied to these 
	  requirements. Eventually, the purpose of the document is to recommend which of the 
	  existing tools should be extended and what new tools should be defined to support 
	  the set of OAM requirements for MPLS-TP.  This document reports the conclusions 
	  of the MPLS-TP design team discussions concerning the MPLS-TP OAM tools at IETF75.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
	  <section title="Scope">
        <t>OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) plays a significant
        role in carrier networks, providing methods for fault management and 
		performance monitoring in both the transport and the service layers in order 
		to improve their ability to support services with guaranteed and strict 
		Service Level Agreements (SLAs) while reducing their operational costs.</t>
        <t><xref target="MPLS-TP Reqs"/> in general, and <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"/> 
        in particular define a set of requirements for OAM functionality in MPLS-Transport 
        Profile (MPLS-TP) for MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs) (network infrastructure) 
        and Pseudowires (PWs) (services).</t>

        <t>The purpose of this document is to analyze the OAM requirements and 
        evaluate whether existing OAM tools defined for MPLS can be used to 
        meet the requirements, identify which tools need to be extended to 
        comply with the requirements, and which new tools need to be defined.  We also 
        take the ITU-T OAM toolset, as defined in <xref target="Y.1731"/>, as a candidate to base 
        these new tools upon. The existing tools that are evaluated include LSP Ping 
        (defined in <xref target="LSP Ping"/>), MPLS Bi-directional Forwarding Detection (BFD) 
        (defined in <xref target="BASE BFD"/>) and Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification 
        (VCCV) (defined in <xref target="PW VCCV"/> and <xref target="VCCV BFD"/>), and the 
        ITU-T OAM toolset defined in <xref target="Y.1731"/>.</t>
		
		<t>This document reports the conclusions of the MPLS-TP design team discussions 
		on the MPLS-TP OAM tools at IETF75 and the guidelines that were agreed.  The 
		guidelines refer to a set of existing OAM tools that need to be enhanced to 
		fully support the MPLS-TP OAM requirements and identify new tools that need 
		to be defined. The organizational structure of the documents on MPLS-TP OAM tools 
		was also discussed and agreed at IETF75 and is described later in this document.</t>
        </section>
		  
	  <section title="Organization of the document">
        <t>Sections 1.3 &ndash; 1.6 provide an overview of the existing MPLS tools.</t>
        <t>Section 2 of the document analyzes the requirements that are documented in 
		<xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"/> and provides basic principles of operation for the OAM 
		functionality that is required.</t>

        <t>Section 3 evaluates which existing tools can provide coverage for the different 
		OAM functions that are required to support MPLS-TP.</t>

        <t>The recommendations are summarized in section 4, and reflect the guidelines which 
		were agreed by the MPLS-TP design team during the meetings at IETF 75.  These 
		guidelines relate to the functionality could be covered by the existing toolset and 
		what extensions or new tools would be needed in order to provide full coverage of 
		the OAM functionality for MPLS-TP.</t>

        <t>The OAM tools for MPLS-TP OAM will be defined in a set of documents. Section 5 
		describes the organization of this set of documents as agreed by the MPLS-TP design 
		team at IETF75.</t>

      </section>	  
      <section title="LSP Ping">
        <t>LSP Ping is a variation of ICMP Ping and traceroute <xref target="ICMP" /> adapted 
		to the needs of MPLS LSP.  Forwarding, of the LSP Ping packets, is 
        based upon the LSP Label and label stack, in order to guarantee that the 
        echo messages are switched in-band (i.e. over the same data route) of the LSP.
        However, it should be noted that the messages are transmitted using IP/UDP 
        encapsulation and IP addresses in the 127/8 (loopback) range.  The use of 
        the loopback range guarantees that the LSP Ping messages will be terminated, 
        by a loss of connectivity or inability to continue on the path, without being 
        transmitted beyond the LSP.  For a bi-directional LSP (either associated or 
		co-routed) the return message of the LSP Ping could be sent on the return LSP.  For 
		unidirectional LSPs and in some case for bi-directional LSPs, the return message 
		may be sent using IP forwarding to the IP address of the LSP ingress node.</t>

        <t>LSP Ping extends the basic ICMP Ping operation (of data-plane connectivity and 
        continuity check) with functionality to verify data-plane vs. control-plane 
        consistency for a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) and also Maximum Transmission 
        Unit (MTU) problems.  The traceroute functionality may be used to isolate and localize 
        the MPLS faults, using the Time-to-live (TTL) indicator to incrementally identify the 
        sub-path of the LSP that is successfully traversed before the faulty link or node.</t>
		
		<t>As mentioned above, LSP Ping requires the presenece of the MPLS control plane when
		verifying the consistency of the data-plane against the control-plane.  However, LSP 
        Ping is not dependent on the MPLS control-plane for its operation, i.e. even though the 
        propagation of the LSP label may be performed over the control-plane via the Label 
        Distribution Protocol (LDP).</t>
	    <t>It should be noted that LSP Ping does support unique identification of the LSP 
		within an addressing domain.  The identification is checked using the full FEC 
		identification.  LSP Ping is easily extensible to include additional information 
		needed to support new functionality, by use of Type-Length-Value (TLV) constructs.</t>
        <t>LSP Ping can be activated both in on-demand and pro-active (asynchronous)
        modes, as defined in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" />. </t>

        <t><xref target="P2MP LSP Ping" /> clarifies the applicability of LSP Ping to MPLS P2MP 
        LSPs, and extends the techniques and mechanisms of LSP Ping to the MPLS 
        P2MP environment.</t>
      
        <t><xref target="MPLS LSP Ping" /> extends LSP Ping to operate over MPLS 
        tunnels or for a stitched LSP.</t>

        <t>As pointed out above, TTL exhaust is the method used to terminate flows at
        intermediate LSRs.  This is used as part of the traceroute of a path and to locate a 
		problem that was discovered previously.</t>
        <t>Some of the drawbacks identified with LSP Ping include - LSP Ping is considered 
        to be computational intensive as pointed out in <xref target="MPLS BFD" />.  The 
		applicability for a pro-active mode of operation is analyzed in the sections below.  
		Use of the loopback address range (to protect against leakage outside the LSP) 
		assumes that all of the intermediate nodes support some IP functionality.  Note 
		that ECMP is not supported in MPLS-TP, therefore its implication on OAM 
		capabilities is not analyzed in this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="MPLS BFD">
        <t>BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) <xref target="BASE BFD" /> is a mechanism 
	    that is defined for fast fault detection for point-to-point connections.  BFD defines 
	    a simple packet that may be transmitted over any protocol, dependent on the application 
	    that is employing the mechanism.  BFD is dependent upon creation of a session that 
        is agreed upon by both ends of the link (which may be a single link, LSP, 
        etc.) that is being checked.  The session is assigned a separate identifier by each 
        end of the path being monitored.  This session identifier is by nature only unique 
        within the context of node that assigned it.  As part of the session creation, the 
        end-points negotiate an agreed transmission rate for the BFD packets. BFD supports an 
        echo function to check the continuity, and verify the reachability of the desired 
        destination.  BFD does not support neither a discovery mechanism nor a traceroute 
        capability for fault localization, these must be provided by use of other mechanisms.  
        The BFD packets support authentication between the routers being checked.</t>

        <t>BFD can be used in pro-active (asynchronous) and on-demand modes, as defined 
        in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" />, of operation.</t>

        <t><xref target="MPLS BFD" /> defines the use of BFD for P2P LSP end-points and is used to 
        verify data-plane continuity. It uses a simple hello protocol which can be 
        easily implemented in hardware. The end-points of the LSP exchange hello packets 
        at negotiated regular intervals and an end-point is declared down when expected 
        hello packets do not show up.  Failures in each direction can be monitored 
        independently using the same BFD session.  The use of the BFD echo function and 
        on-demand activation are outside the scope of the MPLS BFD specification.</t>

        <t>The BFD session mechanism requires an additional (external) mechanism to 
        bootstrap and bind the session to a particular LSP or FEC.  LSP Ping is designated 
        by <xref target="MPLS BFD" /> as the bootstrap mechanism for the BFD session in an 
        MPLS environment.  The implication is that the session establishment BFD messages for 
        MPLS are transmitted using a IP/UDP encapsulation.</t>
        <t>In order to be able to identify certain extreme cases of mis-connectivity, it is 
        necessary that each managed connection have its own unique identifiers.  BFD uses 
        Discriminator values to identify the connection being verified, at both ends of the path.
        These discriminator values are set by each end-node to be unique only in the context of 
        that node.  This limited scope of uniqueness would not identify a misconnection of crossing 
        paths that could assign the same discriminators to the different sessions.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="PW VCCV">
        <t><xref target="PW VCCV" /> provides end-to-end fault detection and diagnostics for PWs 
        (regardless of the underlying tunneling technology). The VCCV switching function 
        provides a control channel associated with each PW (based on the PW Associated 
        Channel Header (ACH) which is defined in <xref target="PW ACH" />), and allows 
        sending OAM packets in-band with PW data (using CC Type 1: In-band VCCV)</t>

        <t>VCCV currently supports the following OAM mechanisms: ICMP Ping, LSP Ping, and BFD. 
        ICMP and LSP Ping are IP encapsulated before being sent over the PW ACH.  BFD for 
        VCCV supports two modes of encapsulation - either IP/UDP encapsulated (with IP/UDP 
        header) or PW-ACH encapsulated (with no IP/UDP header) and provides support to 
        signal the AC status. The use of the VCCV control channel provides the context,
        based on the MPLS-PW label, required to bind and bootstrap the BFD session to a 
        particular pseudo wire (FEC), eliminating the need to exchange Discriminator values.</t>
 
        <t>VCCV consists of two components: (1) signaled component to communicate 
        VCCV capabilities as part of VC label, and (2) switching component to cause 
        the PW payload to be treated as a control packet.</t>
	    <t>VCCV is not directly dependent upon the presence of a control plane. 
	    The VCCV capability negotiation may be performed as part of the PW signaling when LDP is used. 
	    In case of manual configuration of the PW, it is the responsibility of the operator 
	    to set consistent options at both ends. </t>

      </section>


      <section title="ITU Recommendation Y.1731">
        <t><xref target="Y.1731"/> specifies a set of OAM procedures and related packet data 
        unit (PDU) formats that meet the transport network requirements for OAM.  These PDU 
        and procedures address similar requirements to those outlined in 
        <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" />.</t>

        <t>The PDU and procedures defined in <xref target="Y.1731"/> are described for an 
		Ethernet environment, with the appropriate encapsulation for that environment.  However, 
		the actual PDU formats are technology agnostic and could be carried over different 
		encapsulations, e.g. VCCV control channel. The OAM procedures, likewise, could be 
		supported by MPLS-TP nodes just as they are supported by Ethernet nodes.</t>

        <t><xref target="Y.1731"/> describes procedures to support the following OAM functions:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Connectivity and Continuity Monitoring &ndash; for pro-active mode 
			end-to-end checking</t>
            <t>Loopback functionality &ndash; to verify connectivity to intermediate nodes in an 
			on-demand mode</t>
            <t>Link Trace &ndash; provides information on the intermediate nodes of the path 
            being monitored, may be used for fault localization.  This is activated in an 
			on-demand mode.</t>
            <t>Alarm Indication Signaling &ndash; for alarm suppression in case of faults 
            that are detected at the server layer, activated pro-actively.</t>
            <t>Remote Defect Indication &ndash; as part of the Connectivity and Continuity 
			Monitoring packets, performed pro-actively</t>
			<t>Locked Signal &ndash; for alarm suppression in case of administrative locking 
			at the server layer. This function is performed pro-actively.</t>
            <t>Performance monitoring &ndash; including measurement of packet delays both uni and 
            bi-directional (on-demand), measurement of the ratio of lost packets (pro-active), 
			the effective bandwidth that is supported without packet loss, and throughput 
			measurement.</t>
          </list> </t>

        <t>The PDU defined in <xref target="Y.1731"/> includes various information elements 
		(fields) including information on the MEG-Level, etc. Addressing of the PDU as 
		defined in <xref target="Y.1731"/> is based on the MAC Address of the nodes, which 
        would need to be adjusted to support other addressing schemes.  The addressing 
		information is carried in &lt;Type, Length, Value&gt; (TLV) fields that follow the 
		actual PDU.  In the LBM PDU the MAC address is used to identify the MIP to which 
		the message is intended</t>

    <section title="Architectural requirements and general principles of operation">
      <t />
      <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> defines a set of requirements on OAM architecture 
      and general principles of operations which are evaluated below:</t>
      
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> requires that OAM mechanisms in MPLS-TP 
            are independent of the transmission media and of the client service 
            being emulated by the PW. The existing tools comply with this 
            requirement.</t>
			
			<t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"/> requires that the MPLS-TP OAM MUST be able 
			to support both an IP based and non-IP based environment.  If the network is IP 
			based, i.e. IP routing and forwarding are available, then the MPLS-TP OAM toolset 
			MUST be able to operate by relying on the IP routing and forwarding capabilities.  
			All of the existing MPLS tools (i.e. LSP Ping, VCCV Ping, MPLS BFD, and VCCV BFD) 
			can support this functionality.  The Y.1731 toolset does not specifically support 
			this functionality, but rather relies on underlying technologies for forwarding 
			this could also be over IP, e.g. by using a VCCV extension.  Note that some of 
			the MPLS-TP tools such as Alarm Report are very transport oriented and may not 
			support IP functionality.</t>

            <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> requires that MPLS-TP OAM MUST be able 
            to operate without IP functionality and without relying on control 
            and/or management planes.  It is required that OAM functionality MUST 
            NOT be dependent on IP routing and forwarding capabilities. Except for the 
			LSP Ping operation of verifying the data-plane vs. the control-plane, the 
            existing tools do not rely on control and/or management plane, however 
            the following should be observed regarding the reliance on IP functionality:</t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>LSP Ping, VCCV Ping, and MPLS BFD makes use of IP header (UDP/IP) and do not 
			  completely comply with the requirement. In the on-demand mode, LSP Ping also 
              may use IP forwarding to reply back to the source router.  This dependence on 
              IP, has further implications concerning the use of LSP Ping as the 
              bootstrap mechanism for BFD for MPLS.  There are extensions to LSP-Ping that 
			  are under discussion that allow LSP-Ping to restrict replies to the
			  backside of a bidirectional LSP.</t>

              <t>VCCV BFD supports the use of  PW-ACH encapsulated  BFD sessions 
              for PWs and can comply with the requirement.</t>

              <t>Y.1731 PDU are technology agnostic and thereby not dependent on IP 
			  functionality.  These PDU could be carried by VCCV or G-ACH control channels.</t>
            </list>

            <t><xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> requires that OAM tools for fault 
            management do not rely on user traffic, and the existing MPLS OAM 
            tools and Y.1731 already comply with this requirement. </t>

            <t> It is also required that OAM packets and the user traffic are congruent (i.e.
            OAM packets are transmitted in-band) and there is a need to differentiate OAM

        <section title="Architectural and Principles of Operation &ndash; Recommendations and Guidelines">

          <t>Based on the requirements analysis above, the following guidelines 
          should be followed to create an OAM environment that could more fully 
          support the requirements cited:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">

             <t>Define a generalized addressing scheme that can also support unique 
			 identification of the monitored paths (or connections).</t>
             <t>Use G-ACH for LSP and section levels.</t>
			 <t>Define architectural element that is based on LSP hierarchy to apply 
			 the mechanisms to segments and concatenated segments.</t>
             <t>Apply BFD to these new mechanisms using the control channel 
             encapsulation, as defined above &ndash; allowing use of BFD for MPLS-TP 
             independent of IP functionality.  This could be used to address the CC-V 
			 functionality, described below.</t>
			 <t>Similarly, LSP Ping could be extended to use only the LSP path (in both 
			 directions) without IP Forwarding.  Addressing for PW can be included by using
			 the VCCV mechanism.  LSP Ping could be used to address the CC-V, Route Tracing,
			 RDI, and Lock/Alarm Reporting functionality cited in the requirements.</t>

             <t>The Y.1731 PDU set could be used as a basis for defining the information units 
             to be transmitted over the G-ACH.  The actual procedures and addressing schemes would 
             need to be adjusted for the MPLS-TP environment.</t>

             <t>Define a mechanism that could be used to idnetify an intermediate point of a 
			 path in a unique way, to support the maintenance functions.  This addressing 
			 should be flexible to allow support for different addressing schemes, and would 
			 supplement the TTL exception mechanism to allow an OAM packet to be intercepted 
			 by intermediate nodes.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>Creating these extensions/mechanisms would fulfill the following architectural
          requirements, mentioned above:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
             <t>Independence of IP forwarding and routing, when needed.</t>
             <t>OAM packets should be transmitted in-band.</t>
             <t>Support a single OAM technology for LSP, PW, and Sections.</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>In addition, the following additional requirements can be satisfied:</t>

          <t><list style="symbols">
             <t>Provide the ability to carry other types of communications (e.g., 
             APS, Management Control Channel (MCC), Signaling Control Channel 
             (SCC)), by defining new types of communication channels for PWs, Sections,
             and LSPs.</t>

             <t>The design of the OAM mechanisms for MPLS-TP MUST allow the 
             ability to support vendor specific and experimental OAM functions.</t>

          </list></t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="MPLS-TP OAM Functions">
        <t>The following sections discuss the required OAM functions that were 
        identified in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" />.</t>

        <section title="Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification">
          <t>Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification (CC-V) are OAM operations
          generally used in tandem, and compliment each other.  These functions may be
		  split into separate mechanisms.  Together they are used to detect loss of 
		  traffic continuity and misconnections between path end-points and are useful for 
		  applications like Fault Management, Performance Monitoring and Protection 
		  Switching, etc.  To guarantee that CC-V can identify misconnections from 
		  cross-connections it is necessary that the tool use network-wide unique 
		  identifiers for the path that is being checked in the session.</t>

          <section title="Existing tools">
            <t>LSP Ping provides much of the functionality required for co-routed 
			bidirectional LSPs. As observed above, LSP Ping may be operated in both 
			asynchronous and on-demand mode.  Addressing is based on the full FEC identification 
			that provides a unique identifier, and the basic functionality only requires 
			support for the loopback address range in each node on the LSP path.</t>
            <t>BFD defines functionality that can be used to support the pro-active OAM CC-V 
            function when operated in the asynchronous mode.  However, the current definition 
            of basic BFD is dependent on use of LSP Ping to bootstrap the BFD session.  Regarding
            the connectivity functional aspects, basic BFD has a limitation that it uses only 
            locally unique (to each node) session identifiers.</t> 
            <t>VCCV can be used to carry either LSP Ping or BFD packets that are not IP/UDP 
            encapsulated for CC-V on a PW. Note that PW termination/switching points use only 
			locally unique (to each node) labels. The PW label identifies the path uniquely 
			only at the LSP level.</t>
            <t>Y.1731 provides functionality for all aspects of CC-V for an Ethernet 
            environment, this could be translated for the MPLS-TP environment.  The CCM PDU 
            defined in <xref target="Y.1731"/> includes the ability to set the frequency 
            of the messages that are transmitted, and provides for attaching the address of 
            the path (in the Ethernet case &ndash; the MEG Level) and a sequencing number to 
            verify that CCM messages were not dropped.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Gap analysis">
            <t>LSP Ping could be used to cover the cases of co-routed bidirectional LSPs.  
			However, there is a certain amount of computational overhead involved with use 
			of LSP Ping (as was observed in sec 1.1), the verification of the control-plane, 
			and the need to support the loopback functionality at each intermediate node.
			LSP Ping uses a fully qualified LSP identifier, and when used in conjunction
			with VCCV would use the PW label to identify the transport path.  LSP Ping can 
			be extended to bypass the verification of the control plane</t>

            <t>BFD could be extended to fill the gaps indicated above.  The extension would include:

              <list style="symbols">
                <t>A mechanism should be defined to carry BFD packets over LSP without
                reliance on IP functionality.</t>

                <t>A mechanism should be defined to bootstrap BFD sessions for 
                MPLS that is not dependent on UDP.</t>

                <t>BFD needs to be used in conjunction with &quot;globally&quot; unique 
                identifiers for the path or ME being checked to allow connectivity 
                verfication support.  There are two possibilities, to allow BFD to support 
                this new type of identifier &ndash;
                  <list style="symbols">
                    <t>Change the semantics of the two Discriminator fields that exist in
                    BFD and have each node select the ME unique identifier.  This may have
                    backward compatibility implications.</t>

                    <t>Create a new optional field in the packet carrying the BFD that would 
                    identify the path being checked, in addition to the existing session 
                    identifiers.</t>
                  </list>
                </t>

                <t>Extensions to BFD would be needed to cover P2MP connections.</t>
              </list>
            </t>

            <t>Use of the Y.1731 functionality is another option that could be considered.  The 
            basic PDU for CCM includes (in the flags field) an indication of the frequency of the 
            packets [eliminating the need to "negotiate" the frequency between the end-points], 
            and also a flag used for RDI.  The procedure itself would need adaptation to comply 
            with the MPLS environment.</t>

            <t>An additional option would be to create a new tool that would give coverage
            for both aspects of CC-V according to the requirements and the principles of operation
            (see section 2.1).  This option is less preferable.</t>

            <t>Extend LSP Ping to fully support the on-demand Connectivity Verification function 
			resolving the gaps described above. Extend BFD to support proactive Continuity Check

            <t>Note that <xref target="MPLS BFD" /> defines a method for using BFD to provide 
            verification of multipoint or multicast connectivity.</t>

        <section title="Alarm Reporting">
          <t>Alarm Reporting is a function that is used by an intermediate point in a path   
          to notify the end-points of the path of a fault or defect condition indirectly 
		  affecting that path. Such information may be used by the endpoints, for example,
		  to  suppress alarms that may be generated by maintenance end-points of the path.
          This function should also have the capability to differentiate an administrative 
          lock from a failure condition at a different execution level.</t>

          <section title="Existing tools">
            <t>There is no mechanism defined in the IETF to support this function.

          by sending packets of varying sizes at increasing rates (until the limits of the 
          service level) to measure the actual utilization.</t>

        <section title="Route Tracing">
          <t>Functionality of route determination is used to determine the route of a connection 
          across the MPLS transport network. <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" /> defines that 
		  this functionality MUST allow a path end-point to identify the intermediate and 
		  end-points of the path.  This functionality MUST support co-routed bidirectional 
		  paths, and MAY support associated bidirectional and unidirectional p2p paths, as 
		  well as p2mp unidirectional paths.  Unidirectional path support is dependent on 
		  the existence of a return path to allow the original end-point to receive the trace 
		  information.</t>

          <section title="Existing tools">
            <t>LSP Ping supports a trace route function that could be used for bidirectional

        <section title="Lock Instruct">
          <t>The Lock instruct function allows the system to block off transmission of

        <section title="Packet Delay Measurement">
          <t>Packet Delay Measurement is a function that is used to measure one-way or 
          two-way delay of a packet transmission between a pair of the end-points of a 
		  path (PW, LSP, or Section). Where:</t>
          <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>One-way packet delay is the time elapsed from the start of 
            transmission of the first bit of the packet by a source node until the 
            reception of the last bit of that packet by the destination node.</t>

            <t>Two-way packet delay is the time elapsed from the start of transmission 
            of the first bit of the packet by a source node until the reception of 
            the last bit of the loop-backed packet by the same source node, when 
            the loopback is performed at the packet&apos;s destination node.</t>

          </list></t>


          <t>Similarly to the packet loss measurement this could be performed in one of 
          two ways &ndash;</t>
          <t><list style="symbols">
             <t>Using OAM packets &ndash; checking delay (either one-way or two-way) in 
             transmission of OAM packets.  May not fully reflect delay of larger packets, 
             however, gives feedback on general service level.</t>
             <t>Using delimited periods of transmission &ndash; may be too intrusive on the 
             client traffic.</t>
             </list></t>


          <section title="Existing tools">
            <t>There is no mechanism defined in the IETF toolset that fulfills all of the 
            MPLS-TP OAM requirements.</t>
            <t><xref target="Y.1731"/> describes a function in which specific OAM packets 
            are sent with a transmission time-stamp from one end of the managed path to the 
            other end (these are transparent to the intermediate nodes).  The delay 
            measurement is supported for both one-way and two-way measurement 
            of the delay.  It should be noted that the functionality on the one-way delay
			measurement is dependent upon a certain degree of synchronization between the 
			time clocks of the two-ends of the transport path.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Recommendations and Guidelines">
            <t>Define a mechanism that would support Packe Delay Measurement, based on the 
			procedures defined in <xref target="Y.1731" />.  The mechanism should be based 
			on measurement of the delay in transmission and reception of OAM packets, 
			transmitted in-band with normal traffic.  Define an appropriate PDU that would 
			utilize the G-ACH.</t>

        </section>

      </section>

      <section title="Recommendations">
	    <t>As indicated above, LSP-Ping could easily be extended to support some of the 
		functionality between the path end-points and between an end-point of a path and an 
		intermediate point. BFD could also be extended to support some of the functions 
		between the end-points of a path. Some of the OAM functions defined in 
		<xref target="Y.1731"/> (especially for performance monitoring) could also be adapted.</t> 

        <t>The guidelines that are used in this document are as follows:</t>
		<list style="symbols">
          <t>Re-use/extend existing IETF protocols wherever applicable.</t>
          <t>Define new message format for each of the rest of the OAM functions, which 
		  are aligned with the ACH and ACH-TLV definitions, and includes only relevant 
		  information.</t>
          <t>Adapt Y.1731 functionality where applicable (mainly for performance monitoring).</t>
        </list>
		
        <t>The recommendations on the MPLS-TP OAM tools are as follows:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Define a maintenance entity that could be applied both to LSPs and PWs that 
            would support management of a sub-path.  This entity should allow for  
            transmission of traffic by means of label stacking and proper TTL setting.</t>

            <t>Extend the control and the management planes to support the 
            configuration of the OAM maintenance entities and the set of functions 
            to be supported by these entities.</t>

            <t>Define a mechanism that would allow the unique addressing of the elements 
            that need to be monitored, e.g., the connections, end-points, and intermediate 
			points of a path.  This mechanism needs to be flexible enough to support 
			different addressing schemes, e.g. IP addresses, NSAP, connection names.  As 
			pointed out above, LSP Ping uses the full FEC identifier for the LSP - this 
			could easily be applied to Section OAM since this would be considered as a 
			stacked LSP.</t>

            <t>The appropriate assignment of network-wide unique identifiers for transport 
			paths, needed to support connectivity verification, should be considered.</t>

            <t>Extend existing MPLS tools to disengage from IP forwarding mechanisms.</t>

            <t>Extend BFD to support the proactive CC-V functionalities. The extensions should 
			address the gaps described above.</t>
            <t>Extend LSP Ping to support the on-demand Connectivity Verification functionality. 
			The extensions should address the gaps described above.</t>
            <t>Define a new PDU which will be transmitted over G-ACH to support the Alarm 
			Reporting functionality for data-plane implementations. Describe how Alarm 
			Reporting can be supported by a control-plane and by a management-plane.</t>
            <t>Define a new PDU which will be transmitted over G-ACH to support the Lock 
			Reporting functionality. Use the same procedures as for Alarm Reporting.</t>
            <t>Extend BFD to support the Remote Defect Indication (RDI) functionality. The 
			extensions should address the gaps described above.</t>
            <t>Extend LSP-Ping to support the Route tracing functionality. The extensions 
			should address the gaps described above.</t>
            <t>Extend LSP-Ping to support the Lock Instruct functionality between end-points 
			of a path. The extensions should address the gaps described above.</t>
            <t>Use PWE3 tool to transmit Client Fault Indication (CFI) via ACH. There are 
			already some proposals in the PWE3 WG.</t>
            <t>Define a new PDU which will be transmitted over G-ACH to support the Packet 
			Loss Measurement functionality. Base the functionality on the procedures defined 
			in Y.1731.</t>
            <t>Define a new PDU which be transmitted over G-ACH to support the Packet Delay 
			Measurement functionality. Base the functionality on the procedures defined in 
			Y.1731. For one-way delay measurement define mechanisms to ensure a certain degree 
			of synchronization between the time clocks of the two-ends of the transport path.</t>
            <t>Define a new PDU which be transmitted over G-ACH to support the Diagnostic 
			functionality.</t>

            <t>The tools may have the capability to authenticate the messages.  The information 
			may be carried in a G-ACH TLV.</t>

	<section title="MPLS-TP OAM Documents Organization">
	  <t>The following paragraphs list the set of documents necessary to cover the OAM 
	  functionalities analyzed above. This compilation of documents is one of the outcomes 
	  of the MEAD team discussions that took place during IETF75 in Stockholm.</t>

      <t>It should be noted that the various document titles listed here may not reflect the 
	  draft titles that will be chosen at the time that the drafts are written,  but they 
	  serve just as a topic pointer from the current analysis.</t>

      <section title="Document 1: &quot;Encapsulation of BFD and LspPing in ACH&quot;">
        <t>The scope of the document is to define the usage of LSP Ping and BFD in both IP and 
		IP-less environments. As described in the following paragraphs, BFD and Lsp Ping need 
		to be extended in order to be compliant with <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" />. However, 
		this document should be focused on the existing Lsp Ping and BFD, without necessarily 
		referring to their extended versions.</t>

        <t>The draft &quot;nitinb-mpls-tp-lsp-ping-bfd-procedures&quot; will be considered as the 
		starting point for this definition.</t>

        <t>In particular, the following sections will be taken into account for the scope:</t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>nitinb-mpls-tp-lsp-ping-bfd-procedures section 2 (&quot;LSP-Ping extensions&quot;) 
			for addressing the &quot;Lsp Ping encapsulation in ACH&quot;</t>

            <t>nitinb-mpls-tp-lsp-ping-bfd-procedures section 5 (&quot;Running BFD over MPLS-TP 
			LSPs&quot;) for addressing the &quot;BFD encapsulation in ACH&quot;</t>
		  </list>
	  </section>

      <section title="Document 2: &quot;Extended BFD&quot;">
        <t>The scope of the document is to define the BFD extension and behavior to meet the 
		requirements for MPLS-TP proactive Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification 
		functionality and the RDI functionality as defined in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs" />.</t>

        <t>The document will likely take the name &quot;draft-asm-mpls-tp-bfd-cc-cv-00&quot; and will 
		be formed by the merging of the following two drafts:</t>
		<list style="symbols">
          <t>draft-fulignoli-mpls-tp-bfd-cv-proactive-and-rd</t>
          <t>draft-boutros-mpls-tp-cc-cv-01.txt</t>
		</list>
       </section>

      <section title="Document 3: &quot;Extended LSP Ping&quot;">
        <t>The scope of the document is to define:</t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>A place holder for On Demand Connectivity Verification if LSP Ping needs to be 
		  enhanced over and above the encapsulations changes (defined in Document 1 
		  &quot;Encapsulation of BFD and LSP Ping in ACH&quot;).</t>

          <t>Usage of LSP Ping with MIPs and MEPs, which is partially covered in 
		  nitinb-mpls-tp-lsp-ping-bfd-procedures.</t>

          <t>Route Trace. This topic has already been partially covered in 
		  &quot;draft-boutros-mpls-tp-path-trace-00&quot; and 
		  &quot;nitinb-mpls-tp-lsp-ping-bfd-procedures&quot;, which will be considered as 
		  starting point for the Route Trace functionality included in Document 3. The 
		  Route Trace section should also cover these aspects:</t>
		  <list style="symbols">
            <t>LSP Ping Loose ends. This section will describe what to do when receiving 
			an LSP Ping with MIP and MEP ids.</t>

            <t>In an IP-Less environment Route Trace works only in co-routed bidirectional LSP.</t>

            <t>In Y.1731 the CV function is separate from the Route Trace function, it should 
			be captured how LSP Ping works for Route Trace using TTL.</t>
		  </list>
        </list>
       </section>
	   
      <section title="Document 4: &quot;Extensions for Lock Instruct&quot;">
        <t>A new document describing the LSP Ping extensions to accomplish the Lock Instruct 
		desired behavior is needed. Some material useful for this scope can be found in 
		&quot;draft-boutros-mpls-tp-loopback-02&quot;.</t>
	  </section>
 
      <section title="Document 5: &quot;AIS and Lock Reporting&quot;">
        <t>A new document is need for the definition of the AIS and Lock Reporting, however 
		the document definition has been temporarily deferred by the MEAD team. Therefore 
		this paragraph will be updated in future versions.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Document 6: &quot;Client Fault Indication&quot;">
        <t>A new document describing Client Fault Indication procedure needs to be defined.</t>

		<t>The following two drafts indicating a client fault indication transported across 
		MPLS-TP network will be compared and merged in the new document:</t>
		<list style="symbols">
          <t>&quot;draft-he-mpls-tp-csf&quot;, which describes a tool to propagate a client 
		  failure indication across an MPLS-TP network in case the propagation of failure 
		  status in the client layer is not supported.</t>

          <t>&quot;draft-martini-pwe3-static-pw-status&quot;, which describes the usage of 
		  PW associated channel to signal PW status messages in case a static PW is used 
		  without a control plane</t>
        </list>
        <t>It is worth noting that a Client Failure Indication is used if the client does 
		not support its own OAM (IP and MPLS as clients use their own). It has been also 
		agreed that CFI is used on PW and not on client directly mapped on LSP MPLS-TP.</t>
	  </section>

      <section title="Document 7: &quot;Packet Loss&quot;">
        <t>A new document needs to be defined in order to describe a stand alone tool for 
		Packet Loss measurements that can work both proactively and on demand. The tool 
		will be functionally based on Y.1731.</t>
      </section>
	  
      <section title="Document 8: &quot;Packet Delay&quot;">
        <t>A new document needs to be defined about the Packet Delay measurement which will 
		be based on Y.1731 from the functionality point of view. Moreover, 
		<xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Frwk"/> needs to be updated in order to clarify the 
		functionality behavior expected from this tool.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Document 9: &quot;Diagnostic Tests&quot;">
        <t>One or more new documents are needed for the tools definition for Diagnostic Tests. 
		However, the documents definition has been temporarily deferred by the MEAD team until 
		a clearer definition of &quot;diagnostic test&quot; in <xref target="MPLS-TP OAM Reqs"/>.</t>

			 a Multi Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) data plane failure. 
			 LSP-Ping is an existing mechanism for detecting MPLS data plane failures and for 
			 verifying the MPLS LSP data plane against the control plane. BFD can be used for 
			 the former, but not for the latter. However the control plane processing required 
			 for BFD control packets is relatively smaller than the processing required for 
			 LSP-Ping messages. A combination of LSP-Ping and BFD can be used to provide faster 
			 data plane failure detection and/or make it possible to provide such detection on a 
			 greater number of LSPs. This document describes the applicability of BFD in relation 
			 to LSP-Ping for this application. It also describes procedures for using BFD in this 
			 environment.</t>

             <t>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is
             based on a profile of the MPLS and pseudowire (PW) procedures as
             specified in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), pseudowire (PW)
             and multi-segment PW (MS-PW) architectures complemented with
             additional Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
             procedures for fault, performance and protection-switching management
             for packet transport applications that do not rely on the presence of
             a control plane.
 
             This document provides a framework that supports a comprehensive set
             of OAM procedures that fulfills the MPLS-TP OAM requirements. </t>
