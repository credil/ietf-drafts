        This specification defines a new WebDAV property that allows clients to quickly determine the principal corresponding to the current authenticated user.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        WebDAV <xref target="RFC4918"/> is an extension to HTTP <xref target="RFC2616" /> to support improved document authoring capabilities. The WebDAV ACL <xref target="RFC3744"/> extension adds access control capabilities to WebDAV. It introduces the concept of a "principal resource" which is used to represent information about authenticated entities on the system.
      </t>
      <t>
        Some clients have a need to determine the <xref target="RFC3744"/> principal that a server is associating with the currently authenticated HTTP user.  While <xref target="RFC3744"/> defines a DAV:current-user-privilege-set property for retrieving the privileges granted to that principal, there is no recommended way to do identify the principal in question, which is necessary to perform other useful operations.  For example, a client may wish to determine which groups the current user is a member of, or modify a property of the principal resource associated with the current user.
      </t>
      <t>
        The DAV:principal-match REPORT provides some useful functionality, but there are common situations where the results from that query can be ambiguous (e.g. not only is an individual user principal returned, but also every group principal that the user is a member of, and there is no clear way to distinguish which is which).
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification proposes an extension to WebDAV ACL that adds a DAV:current-user-principal property to resources under access control on the server. This property specifies the principal resource corresponding to the currently authenticated user.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />. 
      </t>
      <t>
        When XML element types in the namespace "DAV:" are referenced in this document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" will be prefixed to the element type names.

            <t hangText="Purpose:">
              Indicates a URL for the current authenticated user's principal resource on the server.

            <t hangText="Value:">
              Single DAV:href element.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Protected:">
              This property is computed on a per-request basis, and therefore is protected.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Description:">
              The DAV:current-user-principal property contains either a DAV:href or DAV:unauthenticated XML element. The DAV:href element contains a URL to a principal resource corresponding to the currently authenticated user. That URL MUST be one of the URLs in the DAV:principal-URL or DAV:alternate-URI-set properties defined on the principal resource and MUST be an http(s) scheme URL. When authentication has not been done or has failed, this property MUST contain the DAV:unauthenticated pseudo-principal.
            </t>
            <t>
              In some cases there may be multiple principal resources corresponding to the same authenticated principal. In that case the server is free to choose any one of the principal resource URIs for the value of the DAV:current-user-principal property. However, servers SHOULD be consistent and use the same principal resource URI for each authenticated principal.

              This property is computed on a per-request basis, and is thus never copied or moved.
