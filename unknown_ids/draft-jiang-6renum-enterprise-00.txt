1. Introduction 

   IPv6 site renumbering is considered difficult. Network managers would 
   turn to Provider Independent (PI) addressing for IPv6 to attempt to 
   minimize the need for future renumbering. However, widespread use of 
   PI may create very serious BGP4 scaling problems. It is thus 
   desirable to develop tools and practices that may make renumbering a 
   simpler process to reduce demand for IPv6 PI space. 

   This document undertakes scenario descriptions, including 
   documentation of current capability inventories and existing BCPs, 
   for enterprise networks. It takes the analysis conclusions from 
   [RFC5887] and other relevant documents as the primary input. 

   This document focuses on IPv6 only, by leaving IPv4 out of scope. 
   Dual-stack network or IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios are out of scope, 
   too. 

   According to the different stages of renumbering events, 
   considerations and best current recommendations are described in 
   three categories: during network design, for preparation of 
   renumbering, and during renumbering operation. A gap inventory is 
   listed at the end of this document. 

2. Enterprise Network Illustration for Renumbering 

   The enterprise network architecture is illustrated as the figure 
   below. From the renumbering perspective of view, these entities 
   relevant to renumbering are highlighted. 

   Address reconfiguration is fulfilled either by DHCPv6 or ND  
   protocols. Static address assignment is not considered in this 
   version. During the renumbering event, the DNS records need to be 
   synchronized while routing tables, ACLs and IP filtering tables in 
   various gateways also need to be updated, too.

         Figure 1  Enterprise network illustration 

   It is assumed that IPv6 enterprise networks are IPv6-only, or dual-
   stack in which a logical IPv6 plane is independent from IPv4. The 
   complicated IPv4/IPv6 co-existing scenarios are out of scope. 

   This document focuses on the unicast addresses; site-local, link-
   local, multicast and anycast addresses are out of scope. 

3. Enterprise Network Renumbering Scenario Categories 

   In this section, we category enterprise network renumbering scenarios 
   mainly according to different reasons. Some of renumbering reasons 
   described in [RFC2071] has out of date, or not suitable in IPv6, or 
   not suitable for enterprise networks. 

3.1. Renumbering caused by External Network Factors 

   The most influential external network factor is the uplink ISP. 





 
 
Jiang, et al.         Expires January 03, 2012                [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft  draft-jiang-6renum-enterprise-00.txt         July 2011 
    

   o The enterprise network switches to a new ISP. Of course, the 
      prefixes received from different ISPs are different. This is the 
      most common scenario. 
       
      Whether there is an overlap time between the old and new ISPs 
      would also influence the possibility whether the enterprise can 
      fulfill renumbering without a flag day [RFC4192]. 

   o The renumbering event may be initiated by receiving new prefixes 
      from the same uplink. The typical scenario is that the DHCP server 
      in ISP delegates a new prefix to the enterprise network. Or the 
      enterprise network may be switched to a different location within 
      the network topology of the same ISP due to various  
      considerations, such as commercial, performance or services 
      reasons, etc. The ISP itself may also be renumbered due to 
      topology change or migration to a different or additional prefix. 
      These ISP renumbering events would initiate enterprise network 
      renumbering events, of course. 

   o The enterprise network adds new uplink(s) for multihoming  
      purpose. This may not a typical renumbering because the original 
      addresses will not be changed. However, initial numbering may be 
      considered as a special renumbering event. If the administrators 
      only want part of the network to have multiple prefixes, the 
      renumbering process should be carefully managed. 

3.2. Renumbering caused by Internal Network Factors 

   o As companies split, merge, grow, or reorganize, the enterprise 
      network architectures may need to be re-built. This will trigger 
      the internal renumbering. 

4. Network Renumbering Considerations and Best Current Recommendations 

   In order to carry out renumbering in an enterprise network, 
   systematic planning and administrative preparation are needed. 
   Carefully planning and preparation could make the renumbering process 
   smoother. 

   This section tries to give the recommended solutions or strategies 
   for the enterprise renumbering among the existing mechanisms. There 
   are a few gaps analyzed by [I-D.liu-6renum-gap-analysis]. If they are 
   filled in the future, the enterprise renumbering may be processed 
   more automatically, with fewer issues.

4.1. Considerations and Recommendations during Network Design 

   This section describes the renumbering relevant considerations or 
   issues that a network architect should carefully plan when he builds 
   or designs a new network. 

      - Prefix Delegation 

      In a large or a multi-site enterprise network, the prefix should 
      be carefully managed, particularly during renumbering events. 
      Prefix information needs to be delegated from router to router. 
      The DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation options [RFC3633] provide a mechanism 
      for automated delegation of IPv6 prefixes. DHCPv6 PD options may 
      also be used between the enterprise routers and their upstream 
      ISPs. 

      - Usage of FQDN 

      It is recommended that Fully-Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) should 
      be used to configure network connectivity, such as tunnels. The 
      capability to use FQDNs as endpoint names has been standardized in 
      several RFCs, such as [RFC5996], although many system/network 
      administrators do not realize that it is there and works well as a 
      way to avoid manual modification during renumbering. 

      Service Location Protocol [RFC2608] and multicast DNS with SRV 
      records for service discovery can reduce the number of places that 
      IP addresses need to be configured. 

      - Address Types 

      This document focuses on the dynamic-configured global unicast 
      addresses in enterprise networks. They are the targets of 
      renumbering events. 

      Manual-configured addresses are not scalable in medium to large 
      sites, hence be out of scope. However, some hosts such as servers 
      may need static addresses. Manual-configured addresses/hosts 
      should be avoided as much as possible. 

      [Open Question to WG] What we can do regarding to manual 
      configured hosts and static addresses, which do need to be  
      changed? 

      Unique Local Address (ULA, [RFC4193]) may be used on local routers 
      or servers, which only intends for local communications, usually 

 
 
Jiang, et al.         Expires January 03, 2012                [Page 6]

      inside of enterprise networks. Normally, they do NOT need to be 
      changed during the renumbering event. 

      [Open Question to WG] Is anyone actually using ULAs? 

      - Address configuration models 

      In IPv6 networks, there are two auto-configuration models for 
      address assignment: the Stateless Address Auto-Configuration 
      (SLAAC) by Neighbor Discovery (ND, [RFC4861, RFC4862]) and the 
      stateful address configuration by Dynamic Host Configuration 
      Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6, [RFC3315]). In the latest work, DHCPv6 
      can also support host-generate address model by assigning prefix 
      through DHCPv6 messages [I-D.ietf-dhc-host-gen-id]. 

      ND is considered easier to renumber by broadcasting a Router 
      Advertisement message with a new prefix. DHCPv6 can also trigger 
      the renumbering process by sending unicast RECONFIGURE messages 
      though it may cause a large number of interactions between hosts 
      and DHCPv6 server. 

      In principle, a network should choose only one address 
      configuration model and employs either ND or DHCPv6. This document 
      has no preference between ND and DHCPv6 address configuration 
      models. 

      However, since DHCPv6 is also used to configure many other network 
      parameters, there are ND and DHCPv6 co-existing scenarios. The 
      current protocols do not effectively prevent that both SLAAC and 
      DHCPv6 address assignment are used in the same network (see M bit 
      analysis in section 5.1.1 [RFC5887]). It is network architects' 
      job to make sure only one configuration model is employed. Even in 
      a large network that contains several subnet works, it is 
      recommended not to mix the two address configuration models though 
      isolately using them in different subnet works may reduce the risk 
      partly. 

      - DNS 

      It is recommended that the site have an automatic and systematic 
      procedure for updating/synchronising its DNS records, including 
      both forward and reverse mapping [RFC2874]. Manually on-demand 
      updating model is considered as a harmful problem creator in 
      renumbering event. 

      A6 DNS record model is recommended over AAAA record model for 
      renumbering purpose [RFC2874, RFC3364]. 
 
 
Jiang, et al.         Expires January 03, 2012                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft  draft-jiang-6renum-enterprise-00.txt         July 2011 
    

      In order to simplify the operation procedure, the network 
      architect should combine the forward and reverse DNS updates in a 
      single procedure. 

      If a small site depends on its ISP's DNS system rather than 
      maintains its own one. When renumbering, it requires 
      administrative coordination between the site and its ISP. 
      Alternatively, the DNS synchronizing may be completed through the 
      Secure Dynamic DNS Update. 

      - Security 

      Any automatic renumbering scheme has a potential exposure to 
      hijacking at the moment that a new address is announced. Proper 
      network security mechanisms should be employed. Secure Neighbor 
      Discovery (SEND, [RFC3971]), which does not widely deployed, is 
      recommended to replace ND. Alternatively, certain lightweight 
      renumbering specific security mechanism may be developed in the 
      future. DHCPv6 build-in secure mechanisms, like Secure DHCPv6  
      [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6] or authentication of DHCPv6 messages 
      [RFC3315] are recommended. 

      - Miscellaneous 

      A site or network should also avoid to embed addresses from other 
      sites or networks in its own configuration data. Instead, the 
      Fully-Qualified Domain Names should be used. Thusness, these 
      connectivities can survive after renumbering events. This also 
      applies to host-based connectivities. 

4.2. Considerations and Recommendations for the Preparation of 
   Renumbering 

   It is not possible to reduce a prefix's lifetime to below two hours. 
   So, renumbering should not be an unplanned sudden event. This issue 
   could only be avoided by early planning and preparation. 

   This session describes several recommendations for the preparation of 
   enterprise renumbering event. By adopting these recommendations, a 
   site could be renumbered easier. However, these recommendations are 
   not cost free. They might increase the daily burden of network 
   operation. Therefore, only these networks that are expected to be 
   renumbered soon or very frequently should adopt these recommendations 
   with the balance consideration between daily cost and renumbering 
   cost. 

      - Reduce the address preferred time or valid time or both. 
 
 
Jiang, et al.         Expires January 03, 2012                [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft  draft-jiang-6renum-enterprise-00.txt         July 2011 
    

      Long-lifetime addresses may cause issues for renumbering events. 
      Particularly, some offline hosts may reconnect back using these 
      addresses after renumbering events. Shorter preferred lifetime 
      with relevant long valid lifetime may get short transition period 
      for renumbering event and avoid address renew too frequent. 

      - Reduce the DNS record TTL. 

      The DNS record TTL on the local DNS server should be manipulated 
      to ensure that stale addresses are not cached. 

      - Reduce the DNS configuration lifetime on the hosts. 

      Since the DNS server could be renumbered as well, the DNS 
      configuration lifetime on the hosts should also be reduced if 
      renumbering events are expected. The DNS configuration can be done 
      through either ND [RFC6106] or DHCPv6 [RFC3646]. However, DHCPv6 
      DNS option does not include associated lifetime. It should be 
      updated. 

4.3. Considerations and Recommendations during Renumbering Operation 

   Renumbering events are not instantaneous events. Normally, there is a 
   transition period, in which both the old prefix and the new prefix 
   are used in the site. Better network design and management, better 
   pre-preparation and longer transition period are helpful to reduce 
   the issues during renumbering operation. 

      - Within/without a flag day  

      As is described in [RFC4192], "a 'flag day' is a procedure in 
      which the network, or a part of it, is changed during a planned 
      outage, or suddenly, causing an outage while the network 
      recovers." 

      If renumbering event is processed within a flag day, the network 
      service/connectivity will be outage for a period till the 
      renumbering event is completed. It is efficient and provides 
      convenient for network operation and management. But network 
      outage is usually unacceptable for end users and the enterprises. 
      Renumbering procedure without a flag day provides smooth addresses 
      switching, but much more operational complexity and difficulty is 
      introduced. 

      - Transition period 


 
 
Jiang, et al.         Expires January 03, 2012                [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft  draft-jiang-6renum-enterprise-00.txt         July 2011 
    

      If renumbering transition period is longer than all addresses  
      lifetime, after which the addresses lease expire, each host will 
      automatically pick up its new IP address. In this case, it would 
      be the DHCP server or Router Advertisement itself that 
      automatically accomplishes client renumbering. 

      - Network initiative enforced renumbering 

      If the network has to enforce renumbering before addresses lease 
      expire, the network should initiate enforcement messages, either 
      in Router Advertisement messages or DHCPv6 RECONFIGURE messages. 

      - Impact to branch/main sites  

      Renumbering in main/branch site may cause impact on branch/main 
      site communication. The routes, ingress filtering of site's 
      gateways, and DNS may need to be updated. This needs carefully 
      planning and organizing. 

      - DNS record update and DNS configuration on hosts 

      DNS records should be updated if hosts are renumbered. If the site 
      depends on ISP's DNS system, it should report the new host's DNS 
      records to its ISP. During the transition period, both old and new 
      DNS records are valid. If the TTL of DNS records is shorter than 
      the transition period, administrative operation may not be 
      necessary. 

      DNS configuration on hosts should be updated if local recursive 
      DNS servers are renumbered. During the transition period, both old 
      and new DNS addresses may co-exist on the hosts. If the lifetime 
      of DNS configuration is shorter than the transition period, name 
      resolving failure may not be reduced to minimum. A notification 
      mechanism may be needed to indicate the hosts that a renumbering 
      event of local recursive DNS happens or is going to take place. 

      - Router awareness 

      In a site with multiple border routers, all border routers should 
      be aware of partial renumbering in order to correctly handle 
      inbound packets. Internal forwarding tables need to be updated. 

      - Border filtering 

      In a multihomed site, an egress router to ISP A could normally 
      filter packets with source addresses from other ISPs. The egress 
      router connecting to ISP A should be notified if the egress router

      connecting to ISP B initiates a renumbering event in order to 
      properly act filter function. 

      - Tunnel concentrator renumbering 

      Tunnel concentrator itself might be renumbered. This change should 
      be reconfigured to relevant hosts or router, unless the 
      configuration of tunnel concentrator was based on FQDN.  

5. Gap Inventory 

   This section lists a few issues that still remain unsolvable. Some of 
   them may be inherently unsolvable. 

      -  Manual or script-driven procedures will break the completely 
         automatic host renumbering. 

      -  Some environments like embedded systems might not use DHCP or 
         SLAAC and even configuration scripts might not be an option. 
         This creates special problems that no general-purpose solution 
         is likely to address. 

      -  TCP and UDP flows can't survive at renumbering event at either 
         end. 

      -  Some address configuration data might be widely dispersed and 
         much harder to find, even will inevitably be found only after 
         the renumbering event. 

      -  The embedding of IPv6 unicast addresses into multicast 
         addresses and the embedded-RP (Rendezvous Point) [RFC3956] will 
         cause issues when renumbering. 

      -  Changing the unicast source address of a multicast sender might 
         also be an issue for receivers. 

      -  When a renumbering event takes place, entries in the state 
         table of tunnel concentrator that happen to contain the 
         affected addresses will become invalid and will eventually time 
         out. However, this can be considered as harmless though it 
         takes sources on these devices for a while. 

      -  A site that is listed in a black list can escape that list by 
         renumbering itself. The site itself of course will not 
         initiatively to report its renumbering and the black list may 
         not be able to monitor or discover the renumbering event.

      -  Multihomed site, using SLAAC for one address prefix and DHCPv6 
         for another, would clearly create a risk of inconsistent host 
         behaviour and operational confusion. 

      -  The impact of portion renumbering may need to be analyzed 
         further. 

   Some of these issues can be considered as harmless or have minimum 
   impacts. 

6. Security Considerations 

   A site that is listed in a black list can escape that list by 
   renumbering itself. 

   Any automatic renumbering scheme has a potential exposure to 
   hijacking at the moment that a new address is announced. Proper 
   network security mechanisms should be employed. SEND is recommended 
   to replace ND. Alternatively, certain lightweight renumbering 
   specific security mechanism may be developed in the future. DHCPv6 
   build-in secure mechanisms, like Secure DHCPv6  
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6] or authentication of DHCPv6 messages 
   [RFC3315] are recommended. 

   The security updates will need to be made in two stages (immediately 
   before and immediately after the event).
