    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes the messages and procedures for the Diameter
      QoS Application. The QoS Application allows network elements to interact
      with Diameter servers when allocating QoS resources in the network.</t>

      <t>In particular, two modes of operation are defined. In the first,
      called "Pull Mode", the network element queries the Diameter
      infrastructure for authorization based on some trigger (such as a QoS
      signaling protocol) that arrives along the data path to be used for the
      session. In the second, called "Push Mode", a Diameter server
      pro-actively sends a command to the network element(s) to install QoS
      authorization state. This could be triggered, for instance, by off-path
      signaling such as SIP-based call control.</t>

      <t>A set of command codes pertinent to this QoS application are
      specified that allows a single Diameter application to support both Pull
      and Push modes based on the requirements of network technologies,
      deployment scenarios and end-host's capabilities. In conjunction with
      parameters defined in other Diameter QoS documents, this document
      depicts basic call flow procedures to establish, modify and terminate a
      Diameter QoS application session.</t>
    </section>

    <!-- ====================================================================== -->

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In addition to the terms defined in other relevant Diameter QoS
      documents (e.g., diameter-qos-framework), the following terms are used in
      this document:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Diameter QoS Application Server"><vspace
          blankLines="1" /> A Diameter QoS application server is a logical
          Diameter node that supports the protocol interaction for QoS
          authorization. The Diameter QoS server resides in the authorizing
          entity and is able to respond to a Diameter session received from a
          Diameter QoS client, or initiate a Diameter session to a Diameter
          QoS client triggered by application signaling or local
          events.<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

          <t hangText="Diameter QoS Application Client"><vspace
          blankLines="1" /> A Diameter QoS application client is a logical
          Diameter node that supports the protocol interaction for QoS
          enforcement. The Diameter QoS client resides in the network element
          and is able to initiate a Diameter session triggered by a QoS
          signaling or other events, or respond to a Diameter session
          initiated by a Diameter QoS server.<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

          <t hangText="Resource Requesting Entity"><vspace blankLines="1" /> A
          resource requesting entity is a logical entity that supports the
          protocol interaction for QoS resources. The resource requesting
          entity resides in the end-host and is able to communicate with peer
          logicial entities in Authorizing Entity or Network element to
          trigger the QoS authorization process.<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <!-- ====================================================================== -->

    <section title="Diameter QoS Authorization Session Establishment and Management">
      <section title="Parties involved">
        <t>Authorization models supported by this application include three
        parties: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Resource requesting entity</t>

            <t>Network Elements (Diameter QoS application (DQA) client)</t>

            <t>Authorizing Entity (Diameter QoS application (DQA) server)</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Note that the QoS resource requesting entity is only indirectly
        involved in the message exchange. This entity provides the trigger to
        initiate the Diameter QoS protocol interaction by transmitting QoS
        signaling messages. The Diameter QoS application is only executed
        between the Network Element (i.e., DQA client) and the Authorizing
        Entity (i.e., DQA server).</t>

        <t>The QoS resource requesting entity may communicate with the
        Authorizing Entity using application layer signaling for negotiation
        of service parameters. As part of this application layer protocol
        interaction, for example using SIP, authentication and authorization
        might take place. This message exchange is, however, outside the scope
        of this document. The protocol communication between the QoS resource
        requesting entity and the QoS Network Element might be accomplished
        using the NSIS protocol suite, RSVP or a link layer signaling
        protocol. A description of these protocols is also outside the scope
        of this document and a tight coupling with these protocols is not
        desirable since this applications aims to be generic.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Diameter QoS Authorization Session Establishment">
        <t>The Pull and Push modes use a different set of command codes for
        session establishment. For other operations, such as session
        modification and termination, they use the same set of command
        codes.</t>

        <t>The Pull mode or Push mode operation is invoked based on the
        trigger of QoS Authorization session. When a QAR with a new session ID
        is received, the Authorizing Entity operates in the pull mode; when
        other triggers are received, the Authorizing Entity operates in the
        push mode. Similarly, when a QIR with new session ID is received, the
        Network Element operates in the push mode; when other triggers are
        recevied, the Network Element operation in the pull mode.</t>

        <section title="QoS authorization session establishment for pull mode">
          <t>A request for a QoS reservation or local events received by a
          Network Element can trigger the initiation of a Diameter QoS
          authorization session. The Network Element generates a
          QoS-Authorization-Request (QAR) message in which it maps required
          objects from the QoS signaling message to Diameter payload
          objects.</t>

          <t><xref target="fig-initial-qos-request-pull"></xref> shows the
          protocol interaction between a resource requesting entity, a Network
          Element and the Authorizing Entity.</t>

          <t>The Authorizing Entity's identity, information about the
          application session and/or identity and credentials of the QoS
          resource requesting entity, requested QoS parameters, signaling
          session identifier and/or QoS enabled data flows identifiers MAY be
          encapsulated into respective Diameter AVPs and included into the
          Diameter message sent to the Authorizing Entity. The QAR is sent to
          a Diameter server that can either be the home server of the QoS
          requesting entity or an application server.</t>

          <t>Authorization processing starts at the Diameter QoS server when
          it receives the QAR. Based on the information in the
          QoS-Authentication-Data, User-Name and QoS-Resources AVPs the server
          determines the authorized QoS resources and flow state
          (enabled/disabled) from locally available information (e.g., policy
          information that may be previously established as part of an
          application layer signaling exchange, or the user's subscription
            profile). The QoS-Resources AVP is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dime-qos-attributes"/>.
            The authorization decision is then reflected in the
          response returned to the Diameter client with the
          QoS-Authorization-Answer message (QAA).</t>

          <t>The Authorizing Entity keeps authorization session state and
          SHOULD save additional information for management of the session
          (e.g., Acc-Multi-Session-Id, Signaling-Session-Id, authentication
          data) as part of the session state information. A
          Signaling-session-Id (if present) SHOULD be used together with the
          generated Acc-Multi-Session-Id AVP (see <xref
          target="accounting-avps"></xref>) for binding the authorization and
          the accounting session information in case of end host mobility
          (i.e., to correlate the Diameter sessions that are initiated for the
          same signaling session from different QoS NE).</t>

          <t>The final result of the authorization request is provided in the
          Result-Code AVP of the QAA message sent by the Authorizing Entity.
          In case of successful authorization (i.e., Result-Code =
          DIAMETER_LIMITED_SUCCESS, (see <xref
          target="diameter-base-avps"></xref>)), information about the
          authorized QoS resources and the status of the authorized flow
          (enabled/disabled) is provided in the QoS-Resources AVP of the QAA
          message. The QoS information provided via the QAA is installed by
          the QoS Traffic Control function of the Network Element. The value
          DIAMETER_LIMITED_SUCCESS indicates that the Authorizing entity
          expects confirmation via an accounting message for successful QoS
          resource reservation and for final reserved QoS resources (see
          below).</t>

          <t>One important piece of information returned from the Authorizing
          Entity is the authorization lifetime (carried inside the QAA). The
          authorization lifetime allows the Network Element to determine how
          long the authorization decision is valid for this particular QoS
          reservation. A number of factors may influence the authorized
          session duration, such as the user's subscription plan or currently
          available credits at the user's account (see <xref
          target="accounting"></xref>). The authorization duration is
          time-based as specified in <xref target="RFC3588"></xref>. For an
          extension of the authorization period, a new
          QoS-Authorization-Request/Answer message exchange SHOULD be
          initiated. Further aspects of QoS authorization session maintenance
          is discussed in <xref target="re-authz"></xref>, <xref
          target="session-termination"></xref> and <xref
          target="accounting"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The indication of a successful QoS reservation and activation of
          the data flow is provided by the transmission of an Accounting
          Request (ACR) message, which reports the parameters of the
          established QoS state: reserved resources, duration of the
          reservation, identification of the QoS enabled flow/QoS signaling
          session and accounting parameters. The Diameter QoS server
          acknowledges the reserved QoS resources with the Accounting Answer
          (ACA) message where the Result-Code is set to 'DIAMETER_SUCCESS'.
          Note that the reserved QoS resources reported in the ACR message MAY
          be different than those initially authorized with the QAA message,
          due to the QoS signaling specific behavior (e.g., receiver-initiated
          reservations with One-Path-With-Advertisements) or specific process
          of QoS negotiation along the data path.</t>

          contacted and the data flow for which the QoS reservation should be

          information that may be previously established as part of an

          <t>The final result of the authorization decision is provided in the
          QoS-Resources AVP of the QIR message sent by the Authorizing Entity.
          The QoS information provided via the QIR is installed by the QoS
          Traffic Control function of the Network Element. In the case of
          successful enforcement, the Result-Code (= DIAMETER_SUCCESS, (see

          reservation and for final reserved QoS resources (see below). An ACR
          message reports the parameters of the established QoS state:
          reserved resources, duration of the reservation, identification of
          the QoS enabled flow/QoS signaling session and accounting parameters
          to accounting server. The accounting server acknowledges the
          reserved QoS resources with the Accounting Answer (ACA) message

          <t>The authorization session for an installed QoS reservation state
          MAY be terminated by the Diameter client by sending a
          Session-Termination-Request message (STR) to the Diameter server.
          This is a Diameter base protocol function and it is defined in <xref
          target="RFC3588"></xref>. Session termination can be caused by a QoS
          signaling messaging requesting deletion of the existing QoS
          reservation state or it can be caused as a result of a soft-state
          expiration of the QoS reservation state. After a successful
          termination of the authorization session, final accounting messages
          MUST be exchanged (see <xref
          target="fig-client-termination"></xref>). It should be noted that
          the two sessions (authorization and accounting) have independent
          management by the Diameter base protocol, which allows for
          finalizing the accounting session after the end of the authorization
          session.</t>

    <section anchor="accounting" title="Accounting">
      <t>The Diameter QoS application provides accounting for usage of
      reserved QoS resources. Diameter QoS accounting has built-in support for
      online, duration based accounting. This accounting is based on the
      notion that the Diameter QoS clients are in the best position to
      determine the cost of those resources.</t>

      <t>In the Diameter QoS application, the router MAY send a
      Cost-Information AVP (see <xref target="RFC4006"></xref>) in the QAR. If
      the Cost-Information AVP includes a Cost-Unit AVP (see <xref
      target="RFC4006"></xref>) then the Cost-Unit SHOULD be "minute". The
      Cost-Information AVPs represent the cost to allocate the resources
      requested in the QoS-Resources AVP included in the same QAR message. The
      QAR MAY optionally contain a Tariff-Time-Change AVP (see <xref
      target="RFC4006"></xref>) which is the time at which the cost will
      change, a second Cost-Information AVP, which is the cost of the reserved
      resources after the tariff time change, and a second Tariff-Time-Change,
      which is the time at which the tariff would change again. Either all
      three or none of these AVPs MUST be present in the QAR.</t>

      <t>The Resource Authorizing Entity returns a CC-Time AVP (see <xref
      target="RFC4006"></xref>) in the QAA message which is the total
      authorized gate-on time for the service. If the QAR included two
      Tariff-Time-Change AVPs, the current time plus the CC-Time AVP returned
      in the QAA MUST NOT exceed the second Tariff-Time-Change AVP from the
      QAR. Based on information in the Cost-Information AVPs, the Resource
      Authorizing Entity can use the CC-Time AVP to guarantee that the total
      cost of the session will not exceed a certain threshold, which allows,
      for example, support of prepaid users.</t>

      <t>Each ACR message contains a triplet of QoS-Resources AVP,
      Cost-Information AVP, and CC-Time AVP. This represents the total time
      consumed at the given cost for the given resources. Note that an ACR
      message MUST be sent separately for each interval defined by the
      Tariff-Time-Change AVPs and the expiration of the CC-Time returned in
      the QAA (see <xref target="fig-qos-request-re-authz"></xref>).</t>

      <t>The Network Element starts an accounting session by sending an
      Accounting-Request message (ACR) after successful QoS reservation and
      activation of the data flow (see <xref
      target="fig-initial-qos-request-pull"></xref>). After every successful
      re-authorization procedure the Network element MUST initiate an interim
      accounting message exchange (see <xref
      target="fig-qos-request-re-authz"></xref>). After successful session
      termination the Network element MUST initiate a final exchange of
      accounting messages for terminating of the accounting session and
      reporting final records for the usage of the QoS resources reserved (see
      <xref target="fig-client-termination"></xref>).</t>

    <section title="Diameter QoS Authorization Application Messages">
      <t>The Diameter QoS Application requires the definition of new mandatory
      AVPs and Command-codes (see Section 3 of <xref

      with Command-Codes whose values MUST be supported by all Diameter
      implementations that conform to this specification.</t>

        <t>This section presents an example of the interaction between the end
        host and Diameter QoS application entities using Pull mode. The
        application layer signaling is, in this example, provided using SIP.
        Signaling for a QoS resource reservation is done using the QoS NSLP.
        The authorization of the QoS reservation request is done by the
        Diameter QoS application (DQA).<figure anchor="fig-example-pull"

        <t>The communication starts with SIP signaling between the two end
        points and the SIP server for negotiation and authorization of the
        requested service and its parameters (see <xref
        target="fig-example-pull"></xref>). As a part of the process, the SIP
        server verifies whether the user at Host A is authorized to use the
        requested service (and potentially the ability to be charged for the
        service usage). Negotiated session parameters are provided to the end
        host.</t>

        <t>Subsequently, Host A initiates a QoS signaling message towards Host
        B. It sends a QoS NSLP Reserve message, in which it includes
        description of the required QoS (QSPEC object) and authorization data
        for negotiated service session (part of the POLICY_DATA object).
        Authorization data includes, as a minimum, the identity of the
        authorizing entity (e.g., the SIP server) and an identifier of the
        application service session for which QoS resources are requested.</t>

        <t>A QoS NSLP Reserve message is intercepted and processed by the
        first QoS aware Network Element. The NE uses the Diameter QoS
        application to request authorization for the received QoS reservation
        request. The identity of the Authorizing Entity (in this case the SIP
        server that is co-located with a Diameter server) is put into the
        Destination-Host AVP, any additional session authorization data is
        encapsulated into the QoS-Authz-Data AVP and the description of the
        QoS resources is included into QoS-Resources AVP. In addition, the NE
        rates the requested QoS resources and announces the charging rate into
        the Cost-Information AVP. These AVPs are included into a QoS
        Authorization Request message, which is sent to the Authorizing
        entity.</t>

        <t>A Diameter QAR message will be routed through the AAA network to
        the Authorizing Entity. The Authorizing Entity verifies the requested
        QoS against the QoS resources negotiated for the service session and
        replies with QoS-Authorization answer (QAA) message. It carries the
        authorization result (Result-Code AVP) and the description of the
        authorized QoS parameters (QoS-Resources AVP), as well as duration of
        the authorization session (Authorization-Lifetime AVP) and duration of
        the time (CC-Time) for which the end-user should be charged with the
        rate announced in the QAR message. The NE interacts with the traffic
        control function and installs the authorized QoS resources and
        forwards the QoS NSLP Reserve message further along the data path.</t>

        <t>The communication starts with SIP signaling between the two end
        points and the SIP server for negotiation and authorization of the
        requested service and its parameters (see <xref
        target="fig-example-push"></xref>). As a part of the process, the SIP
        server verifies whether the user at Host A is authorized to use the
        requested service (and potentially the ability to be charged for the
        service usage). The DQA server is triggered to authorize the QoS
        request based on session parameters (i.e. SDP offer), initiate a
        Diameter QoS authorization session and install authorized QoS state to
        the Network Element via QIR message.</t>

        <t>The DQA server may obtain the info of peer DQA client from
        pre-configured information or query the DNS based on Host A's identity
        or IP address (In this case a DQA server is co-located with a SIP
        server and a DQA client is co-located with a Network element). The
        identity of Network Element is put into the Destination-Host AVP, the
        description of the QoS resources is included into QoS-Resources AVP,
        as well as duration of the authorization session
        (Authorization-Lifetime AVP) and duration of the time (CC-Time) for
        which the end-user should be charged with the rate announced in the
        QIR message. The NE interacts with the traffic control function and
        reserves the authorized QoS resources accordingly.</t>

        <t>With successful QoS authorization, the SDP offer in SIP Invite is
        forwared to Host B. Host B sends back a 18x (ringing) message towards
        Host A and processes the SDP. Once Host B accepts the call, it sends
        back a 200 OK, in which it includes description of the accepted
        session parameters (i.e. SDP answer).</t>

        <t>The DQA server may verifies the accepted QoS against the
        pre-authorized QoS resources, and sends a Diameter RAR message to the
        DQA client in the network element for activating the installed
        policies and commit the resource allocation. With successful QoS
        enforcement, the 200 OK is forwarded towards Host A.</t>

        <t>Note that the examples above show a sender-initiated reservation
        from the End-Host towards the corresponding node and a
        receiver-initiated reservation from the correspondent node towards the
        End-Host.</t>
