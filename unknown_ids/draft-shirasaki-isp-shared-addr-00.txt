Internet-Draft             ISP Shared Address                  June 2008


1.  Introduction

   The current model [EXHA] shows that global IPv4 addresses from the
   IANA pool will run out in a few years.  This document is proposed to
   prepare for the IPv4 address exhaustion.  NOT to expand private
   address space [RFC1918].


2.  Prerequisite

   It assumes an environment where end-users use RFC1918 address behind
   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).  The servers that have ONLY IPv4
   address will continue to exist even after the IPv4 address
   exhaustion.  However, ISPs cannot assign additional global IPv4
   addresses to its end-users in order to access such servers.


3.  Problem

   End-users without any global IPv4 address space will not be able to
   access to the IPv4 Internet after the IPv4 address exhaustion.


4.  Goal

   The goal is to allow the end-users who don't have global IPv4 address
   to access to the IPv4-only servers without having to replace their
   equipments.


5.  Solutions Using Existing Technology

   The following solutions using existing technology cannot achieve the
   goal mentioned above.

5.1.  IPv6 to IPv4 Translator

   This solution has two problems.  Firstly, some end-users still use
   PCs or LAN equipment that doesn't support IPv6.  They cannot use
   IPv6.  Secondly, some web hyperlinks have the numeric IPv4 address
   notation in URL.  PCs having only IPv6 address cannot follow such
   hyperlinks.

5.2.  RFC1918 to IPv6 to IPv4 NAT

   This model is described in [I-D.durand-v6ops-natv4v6v4].  Under this
   model, ISPs must request end-users to replace the CPE, which is end-
   users' property.  Furthermore, the replaced CPE must be "NATV4V6V4



Shirasaki, et al.       Expires December 11, 2008               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             ISP Shared Address                  June 2008


   capable" CPE, which is currently not readily available on the market.
   Even if "NATV4V6V4 capable" CPE will be available in the future, it
   is practically impossible for ISPs to make all their end-users
   replace their equipment.

5.3.  RFC1918 to RFC1918 to IPv4 NAT

   In this model, ISP assigns RFC1918 address to new end-users.  ISPs
   provide the internet connectivity to such end-users using Career
   Grade NAT (CGN).  This solution has two problems.  Firstly, end-
   user's WAN (assigned by ISP) and LAN addresses may conflict.  In such
   situation, end-users may have to renumber their address.  Secondly,
   some firewalls/servers reject packets with RFC1918 address as its
   source address for security reasons, therefore, end-users will not be
   able to access servers behind the same CGN.

5.4.  RFC1918 to IPv4 to IPv4 NAT

   In this mode, ISP requests a certain size of global IPv4 address
   space before the IPv4 address exhaustion to share the same range
   between a set of regions/areas within their infrastructure.  However,
   this solution has some problems.  Firstly, IPv4 global address will
   not be used efficiently compared to other solutions as it requires
   address space to be distributed for each ISP's infrastructure.
   Secondly, since an end-user's IPv4 address is not unique within ISP's
   infrastructure, it is difficult for ISP operators to confirm
   reachability to a specific user by sending packets, such as ICMP
   echo.  Finally, the region may be fragmented to small pieces if ISP
   has only small blocks available for this purpose.


6.  Proposal

   This proposal defines "ISP Shared Address" to be jointly used among
   ISPs.  It is intended to be assigned between CPE and CGN.  This space
   must not to be advertised to the Internet.

   The size of the address space is TBD.  Following table shows the
   coverage by size of ISP shared address.

                          +------+--------------+
                          | Size | ISP Coverage |
                          +------+--------------+
                          |  /10 |      49%     |
                          |  /9  |      58%     |
                          |  /8  |      69%     |
                          |  /7  |      85%     |
                          |  /6  |      96%     |
                          |  /5  |     100%     |
                          +------+--------------+

     ISP coverage is the ratio of numbers of hosts on the Internet to
      numbers of hosts in the ISP which is covered by the size of ISP
                    shared address as of June in 2008.

              Table 1: Coverage by Size of ISP Shared Address


7.  Advantages of This Proposal

   Defining this address space enables ISPs to continue expanding their
   service without requesting end-users to replace or renumber their LAN
   equipment after IPv4 address exhaustion.  Moreover, it overcomes
   problems described in section 5 such as:

   o  It supports "IPv4-only" equipment in end-users' network (problem
      in Section 5.1)

   o  End-users' WAN and LAN addresses do not conflict (problem in
      Section 5.3)

   o  End-users are able to access to servers behind the same CGN
      (problem in Section 5.3)

   o  It is possible for ISP operators to send packets to a specific
      end-user (problem in Section 5.4)


8.  Rationale behind the Proposal

   The rationale to be used by only ISPs:
   - To avoid address conflicts between end-users' WAN (assigned by
   ISPs) and LAN addresses

   The rationale not to use 240/4:
   - Many CPEs, routers, servers and other nodes cannot handle 240/4.

   The rationale to prohibit advertising this address space:

Internet-Draft             ISP Shared Address                  June 2008


   - Many ISPs will use this same space.

   The rationale to prohibit querying for reverse DNS to root DNS:
   - Many ISPs will use this same space.


9.  Possible Issues

   - Global prefix(es) will be consumed.  However, it provides more
   benefit by providing ISPs with an option to continue IPv4 based
   operations even after the IPv4 address exhaustion.

   - Some applications used by end users won't work in the Double-NAT
   network.  However, providing end-users with an option to access to
   the IPv4 Internet with some limitations, is more preferable than
   providing no access to the IPv4 Internet after the IPv4 address
   exhaustion.


10.  Operational Recommendation

   This address space must not be used at IXs.  Reverse DNS queries for
   this address space must not be sent to root DNS servers.

   Tomohiro Fujisaki, Dai Nishino, JP address community members, AP
   address community members and JPNIC members.


12.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is to record the allocation of the IPv4 global unicast address
   prefix TBD as an ISPs Shared use prefix in the IPv4 address registry.


13.  Security Considerations

   ISPs should prevent packets to be sent out from its network with this
   space as source and/or destination address.

Appendix A.  FAQ

   Q1.  Will this address space be used even if it requires large-scale
   renewal/renumbering of a network?
   A1.  Yes, some people expressed their plan to use it in their network
   in APNIC Open Policy Meeting as well as in JPNIC Open Policy Meeting.

   Q2.  Is this proposal intended to delay the date of IPv4 address
   exhaustion?
   A2.  No.  It is intended to address issues after the IPv4 address
   exhaustion.

   Q3.  Is it possible to use this space instead of RFC1918 address in
   private network?
   A3.  No.  Since it creates address conflicts between end-user's WAN
   (this space assigned by ISP) and LAN.

   Q4.  In case of M&A between ISPs using Shared Address, what happens ?
   A4.  Address conflict may happen.  It is out of scope.

   Q5.  Is this proposal different from [I-D.wilson-class-e]?
   A5.  Yes. It is not intended to expand RFC1918 address.
   Furtheremore, it does not consider 240/4 as usable address for this
   purpose.
