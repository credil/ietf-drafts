Abstract

   A vertical session handoff occurs in heterogeneous networks when a
   session media is moved between access networks within the same
   device.  During session handoff, bi-casting media streams to both
   access networks of the session's device may be desirable to insure a
   seamless session handoff.  This document describes the general
   methods and specifies the signaling and media flows for providing
   this service using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1].

Internet-Draft           SIP Session Bi-casting            November 2007


1.  Overview

   A wide variety of access networks have emerged along with the
   popularization of fixed/mobile data communications.  Nowadays, a user
   can access the Internet via several access networks using the same
   device.  For example, the user may use both cellular and WLAN access
   as the situation demands within the same device such as a smartphone
   and a laptop, e.g. cellular access on the outside, WLAN access in the
   house or on the hotspot.  This seems to be the trend for the
   foreseeable future, i.e. we'll be surrounded by a heterogeneous
   network where several access networks supplement each other.  In such
   heterogeneous network environments, it is important that users
   utilize appropriate access network according to their location and
   enjoy their services, especially IP-based multimedia communications,
   with the optimal quality.  In order to continue multimedia
   communications with the optimal quality, a Correspondent Node (CN)
   can change a destination and a communication quality by receiving the
   SIP re-INVITE or the SIP UPDATE message from a Mobile Node (MN) when
   the MN swithes its point of attachment between access networks.
   However, a real-time service can be interrupted in this case due to
   the different characteristics, in the access networks, such as
   throughput and latency.  As compared with non-realtime services such
   as web access and file-downloading, realtime multimedia services such
   as voice and video can suffer degradation in a user's experience when
   the service is interrupted.  Therefore, it is also important to avoid
   service interruption during switchover a session media between access
   networks, i.e. vertical session handoff (HO).  During session HO, bi-
   casting media streams to both access networks of the session's device
   are desirable to avoid the service disruption and insure a seamless
   session handoff.  In addition, bi-casting media streams can also help
   adjust the service quality of the realtime service according to the
   new network of attachment.

   Since IP-based multimedia sessions are handled or controlled by
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1], this document introduces the
   general methods and specifies the signaling and media flows for
   providing this service using SIP.

   This document introduces a SIP-capable network element named the
   Handover Assistive Server (HOAS) which becomes a media stream bi-
   casting control point and is located between UAs (i.e.  MN and CN).
   A number of plausible protocol flows are presented to utilized the
   services of the HOAS in a heterogenous vertical handoff.  This
   document does not describe the HOAS discovery process, which is
   beyond the scope of this document and best addressed using various
   user agent provisioning or service discovery mechanisms.

   In Section 3 the requirements and constraints for media stream bi-

   casting in a vertical handoff are enumerated.  Section 4 introduces
   the architectural elements involved in a bi-casted vertical handoff.
   Section 5 presents two alternative methods for achieving vertical
   session handover with media bi-casting using HOAS assistance.


2.  Terminology

   This section presents a few terms used throughout the document.

   o  Vertical handoff: A vertical handoff refers to changing a mobile
      node's point of attachment between different types of access
      networks, e.g. cellular and WLAN.  The feature of a vertical
      handoff is that the transmission rate and latency may well differ
      significantly before and after handoff, respectively.

   o  Bi-cast: Bi-cast refers to the splitting of a packet stream
      destined to a mobile node into two streams.  A mobile node
      receives two streams simultaneously if the mobile node attaches
      the two systems at the same time.  Bi-cast is shown to be
      effective in reducing packet loss during handoff.


3.  Requirements

   This section describes general requirements for media stream bi-
   casting in a vertical handoff scenario.

   o  Media streams bi-casting should be realized to leverage current or
      emerging practices in the SIP.  In other words, a new method or an
      extra header for media streams bi-casting should not be required.
      This document introduces some examples leveraging Third-Party Call
      Control (3PCC) [3] and SIP's UPDATE [5] methods.

   o  Correspondent Node (CN) should be an basic User Agent (UA) which
      only has basic SIP capabilities to expand the range of application
      for the media streams bi-casting.

   o  If HOAS has the functionality of a transcording service, the bi-
      casted streams can have respective service qualities according to
      respective access systems where the MN attaches.  Transcoding
      combined with media stream bi-casting results in a service quality
      adjustment, improving the end-user mobile experience as in [6],
      when performing a vertical handoff between the heterogenou access
      networks.

4.  Architecture

   The assumed network architecture is illustrated in Figure 1.  In this
   figure, AN1 and AN2 represent alternate access networks available to
   the mobile node.  For example, they could represent a cellular access
   network and a wireless access (WiFi) LAN.  The HOAS represents the
   SIP-enabled Handover Assitive Server.  During a vertical handoff,
   between the mobile node's access networks, the preexisting bearer
   path between MN and CN is switched to pass through the HOAS during
   the duration of the vertical handoff.  During this period of the
   handoff, the HOAS performs packet replication of the media streams
   sent by the CN destined to the MN. and bi-casts the replicated
   streams across both access networks available to the MN.  In
   addition, if the HOAS is capable of performing media transcoding, the
   service quality of the bi-casted streams can be adjusted to match the
   capabilities of each of the MN's access networks.  Traffic sent by
   the MN, destined to CN, may also be simultaneously transmitted across
   each access network, whereby the HOAS can discard the duplicated
   packets the MN.

   Note that the CN could serve as the bi-casting service during a
   vertical handoff.  However, this forces the CN to have both enhanced
   media and SIP signaling capabilities over and above those required by
   a basic SIP client.  Requiring this added functionality within a
   client device would limit the applicability and deployment of
   seamless vertical HO techniques employing media bicasting.  As such,
   the use of the CN to control the seamless handoff is beyond the scope
   of this document.

   Finally, it should be noted that the solutions proposed in this memo
   assume that the coverage areas of the access networks AN1 and AN2
   have some degree of overlap.


5.  Vertical Session Handoff with Media Bi-casting

   Application layer mobility using SIP was examined in [7] through the
   use of both Third-Party Call Control (3PCC) [3] as well as SIP's
   REFER [4] method as possible solutions.  More recently, [8] has
   expanded upon this work and demonstrated the suitability of employing
   either 3PCC or SIP's REFER request as suitable mechanisms for session
   mobility between mobile devices.  Similarly, 3PCC [3] has been
   demonstrated in [9] as the protocol mechanism usefull for
   establishing media transcoding services in a new or existing session.

Internet-Draft           SIP Session Bi-casting            November 2007


   Although SIP mobility [7] and the session mobility [8] can provide a
   terminal mobility or a session mobility through the use of 3PCC [3]
   or SIP's REFER [4] method, there can be a service interruption during
   the hard swithing (handoff).  Bi-cast in the uplink direction, i.e.
   from an MN to a CN, is studied using SIP [10].  But this scheme does
   not take account of the change in the service quality based on the
   access networks.  Furthermore, it requires both an extra header field
   and a new parameter in the Via header field, which cannot satisfy the
   first requirement described in Section 3.

   As stated above, it is desirable to avoid service interruptions
   during a vertical session handoff between access networks with
   different service characteristics.  Furthermore, it is desirable to
   adapt the session's service quality in accordance with the capability
   of the target access network of the handoff.  Bi-casting media
   streams to both access networks with respective service quality
   optimization is and effective means to avoid service disruptions
   while simutaneously improving the end user's experience.  This
   document introduces general methods and specifies the signaling and
   media flows for providing bi-cast support in vertical handoffs using
   the SIP protocol.

5.1.  Mobile Node controlled Vertical Handoff

   The use of the Handover Assistive Server (HOAS) to perform media
   stream bicasting during a vertical handoff is similar to session
   mobility support using Third-Party Call Control (3PCC) signaling
   conventions as originally proposed in [7].  Figure 2 illustrates the
   protocol signaling to enable Bi-casting/Transcoding support during a
   vertical handoff.

Internet-Draft           SIP Session Bi-casting            November 2007


   The example shown in Figure 2 illustrates the signaling used in a
   typical vertical handoff employing media bi-casting.  The signaling
   follows that specified in for Third-Party Call Control, with the MN
   acting as the session mediator.

   In this example, the initial session is established during the first
   SIP transaction comprised of messages 1 through 3.  This session
   consists of the following session parameters for the MN:


               c=IN IP4 IP_MN
               m=video 30002 RTP/AVP 97
               a=rtpmap:97 MP4V_ES/90000
               a=framerate:5
               b=AS:200


   as well as the following session parameters for CN:


               c=IN IP4 IP_CN
               m=video 40002 RTP/AVP 97
               a=rtpmap:97 MP4V_ES/90000
               a=framerate:5
               b=AS:200


   To initiate the vertical handoff between access networks AN1 and AN2,
   the mobile sends a SIP Re-INVITE to the correspondent node, CN,
   without a payload to determine the media capabilities of the CN.
   This information might be cached by the mobile node from a previous
   session establishement with the CN.  The CN responds with a SIP
   response (message 5) containing a SDP packet indicating its
   capabilities.

   For example, the returned response and SDP payload might look as
   follows:


               SIP/2.0 200 OK
               To: sip:CN.domain.com;tag=ccfd12
               From: sip:MN.domain.com;tag=af2c35
               Call-ID: <random string 1>@domain.com
               Contact: sip:MN.an1.domain.com

               c=IN IP4 IP_CN
               m=video 40002 RTP/AVP 96 97
               a=rtpmap:96 MP4V_ES/90000

               a=framerate:15
               b=AS:600


   The MN then, optionally, sends a SIP invite to its interface on the
   access network to which the vertical handoff is directed, to
   determine the media capabilities of the MN on this access network.
   In most instances, this message dialog will be eliminated, but is
   included here for clarity.

   media capabilities on this access network might look as follows:


               SIP/2.0 200 OK
               To: sip:MN.domain;tag=dddf23
               From: sip:MN.domain.com;tag=1dddef
               Call-ID: <random string 2>@domain.com
               Contact: sip:MN.an1.domain.com

               c=IN IP4 IP_IF2
               m=video 50002 RTP/AVP 96 97
               a=rtpmap:96 MP4V_ES/90000
               a=framerate:15
               b=AS:600
               a=rtpmap:97 MP4V_ES/90000
               a=framerate:5
               b=AS:200


   Next, the MN probes the HOAS by sending a SIP INVITE in message 8,
   again without a payload, to determine the media handling capabilities
   of the HOAS.  In similar fashion, the HOAS returns an SDP packet
   indicating its media handling capabilities in message 9.

   At this point the MN has established an active session with the HOAS
   for the purpose of bi-cast and transcoding support during the
   vertical handoff.  However no media is yet exchanged through the
   HOAS.  In message 11, the MN establishes a session with it's second
   interface for the duration of the vertical handoff as follows:


               INVITE sip:an2.domain.com SIP/2.0
               To: sip:domain.com;tag=1dddef
               From: sip:domain.com;tag=dddf23
               Call-ID: <random string 2>@domain.com

               a=rtpmap:96 MP4V_ES/90000
               a=framerate:15
               b=AS:600


   The MN now acknowledges the re-INVITE used to probe the capabilities
   of the CN in message 4 with new session parameters within the body of
   the ACK directing CN to direct it's outbound media to the HOAS as
   follows:


               ACK sip:CN@domain.com SIP/2.0
               To: sip:CN@domain.com;tag=ccfd12
               From: sip:MN@domain.com;tag=af2c35

               a=framerate:15
               b=AS:600


   At the completion of the handover event, a second Re-INVITE to the CN
   is required to establish the MN's new access network as the primary
   media path.  In addition, the resources within the HOAS need to be
   released as well as the temporary session resources that exist
   between MN IF2 and the HOAS.  This protocol sequence is illustrated
   in Figure 3.

     Figure 3 - Bi-cast Handover Completion using 3PCC protocol flows

   In Figure 3, message 1 is a Re-INVITE for the original session
   between MN and CN, and adjusts the session parameters to remove the
   HOAS from the media paths.  The Re-INVITE has the following form:


               INVITE CN@domain.com SIP/2.0
               To: sip:CN@domain.com;tag=ccfd12

   with CN responding in message 2 with the following:


               SIP/2.0 200 OK
               To: sip:CN@domain.com;tag=ccfd12
               From: sip:MN@domain.com;tag=af2c35

               a=framerate: 15
               b=AS:600


   The BYE requests, in messages 3 and 5, terminate the dialogs
   established between the MN and HOAS, as well as the dialog between
   the MN's access networks.  In practice, the intra-MN BYE transaction
   in messages 5 and 6 would be omitted, but is again shown for clarity.

5.2.  A Proxy mediated Vertical Handoff via Session Update

   In the next example, a vertical handoff is accomplished with the HOAS
   functioning as a stateful proxy instantiated in the protocol
   signaling path.  This approach requires that the HOAS is instantiated
   in the signaling path's route set.  From the MN's perspective, for
   example, the HOAS could be configured as the user agent's outbound
   proxy.  This protocol flow utilizes the SIP UPDATE [5] methods to
   redirect, through the HOAS, media streams between the CN and MN.
   Note that the SIP re-INVITE request could be utilized instead of the
   SIP UPDATE, however with the semantics defined for UPDATE requests,
   this method is preferred in a vertical handoff scenario.

   Since the HOAS is now acting as a stateful proxy, it maintains state
   information related to each active session in which it is in the
   signaling path.  This approach also, optionally, introduces new
   attributes to the related Session Description Protocol SDP [2]
   payload to assist the HOAS in determining when the underlying media
   streams need to be routed through the HOAS bicasting function.

   A possible signaling flow for the HOAS proxy use case is illustrated
   in Figure 4.  In the initial INVITE transaction, establishing the
   session dialog between the MN and CN, the HOAS adds itself to the
   dialog's route set via SIP's Record-Route header, thus insuring that
   all further signaling related to the session traverses the HOAS.

   The format for the initial INVITE in message 1 is as follow:

Internet-Draft           SIP Session Bi-casting            November 2007


               INVITE CN@domain.com SIP/2.0
               To: CN@domain.com
               From: MN@domain.com;tag=33dfff
               Route: <HOAS.domain.com;lr>

               Call-ID: <random string 1>@domain.com

               ...


   Alternately, the MN UAC can be configured with the HOAS as it's
   outbound proxy.  In this case, the HOAS processes the INVITE request
   by adding a Record-Route header to the forwarded request.  This would
   appear in message 2 as follows:


               INVITE CN.domain.com SIP/2.0
               To: CN.domain.com
               From: MN.domain.com;tag=33dfff

                     Figure 4 - HOAS Mediated Handoff

   The UPDATE request in message 7 triggers the HOAS to configure the
   necessary resources for media bi-casting to the MN's access networks.
   This requires the HOAS to modify session parameters established with

Internet-Draft           SIP Session Bi-casting            November 2007


   CN such that all media sent from CN destined to the MN is now
   redirected through the HOAS.

   Since the use of media bi-casting is specific to a particular
   session, a new session-level attribute, named 'bicast', is applied to
   the SDP packet describing the bi-cast flows for the MN.  The HOAS
   uses the session level identifier as well as this new session level
   attribute to determine when bi-casting support is required.

   The format of the UPDATE request used to trigger bi-casting support
   within the HOAS is as follows:


               UPDATE CN.domain.com SIP/2.0
               To: sip:CN.domain.com;tag=aaab33
               From: sip:MN.domain.com;tag=111565
               Route: <sip:HOAS.domain.com;lr>
               Call-ID: <random string>@domain.com
               Contact: sip:MH_an1.domain.com

               o=- session_UID session_VER IN IP4 MN_IF1
               a=bicast
               c=IN IP4 MN_IF1
               m=video 30002 RTP/AVP 97
               a=rtpmap:97 MP4V_ES/90000
               a=framerate:15
               b=AS:600

               a=framerate:5
               b=AS:200


   where the bicast attribute is parsed by the HOAS and used to control
   its media handling behavior.

   Upon receiving an UPDATE request with a session description
   requesting bi-casting support, the HOAS sends a corresponding UPDATE
   request (message 8) directing the CN to direct its media flows to the
   HOAS.

   The corresponding SDP packet simply establishes the HOAS as the
   recipient for all CN media:


               o=- session_UID session_VER IN IP4 HOAS_IP
               c=IN IP4 HOAS_IP
               m=video 30006 RTP/AVP 97
               a=fmtp:97 bitrate 600
               a=framerate=15


   In message 10, the MN's updated media streams are redirected through
   the HOAS:


               o=- session_UID session_VER IN IP4 HOAS_IP
               c=IN IP4 HOAS_IP
               m=video 40006 RTP/AVP 97
               a=fmtp:97 bitrate:600
               a=framerate:15
               m=video 50006 RTP/AVP 96
               a=fmtp:96 bitrate:200
               a=framerate:5


   Upon completion of the handoff, the session streams must again be
   adjusted such that the HOAS is no longer part of the media path.  In
   message 11, the session is again updated by the MN to eliminate bi-
   casting within the HOAS.

   The corresponding SDP packet describing the new session parameters
   again contains a session level attribute used to trigger the HOAS to
   stop bi-casting support.  The SDP packet takes the following form:


               o=- session_UID session_VER IN IP4 MN_IF2
               c=IN IP4 MN_IF2
               ...


   The absense of the bicast attribute in this updated session
   description now directs the HOAS to pass the UPDATE request directly
   to the CN and signals the HOAS that all resources used to support bi-
   casting for the session handoff can be released.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   A detailed analysis of the security aspects of the solutions proposed
   in this document needs to be performed to insure that no additional
   security issues have been introduced.  As the solution leverages
   current practices for Third Party Call Control (3PCC) [3] as well as
   the use of SIP's UPDATE [5] method, the security considerations of
   these proposals can be extended to the solutions proposed herein.


8.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would kindly like to thank Mr. Phil Roberts of Motorola
   Laboratories for his assistance in navigating the draft submission
   process as well as helping to coordinate the initial meetings that
   resulted in this draft submission.
