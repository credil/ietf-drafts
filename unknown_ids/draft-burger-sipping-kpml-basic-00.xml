    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a profile of the SIP Event Package "kpml"
      that enables simple monitoring of DTMF signals and uses XML documents
      referred to as Key Press Markup Language (KPML). This profile assumes
      devices of lesser capability that may have trouble parsing subscription
      requests or producing generic XML documents. This is a profile of RFC
      4730, KPML.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes a profile for the SIP Event Package "kpml"
      that enables monitoring of key presses and utilizes XML documents
      referred to as <xref target="RFC4730">Key Press Markup Language
      (KPML)</xref>, RFC 4730.</t>

      <t>A goal of KPML is to fit in an extremely small memory and processing
      footprint. However, some believe that even with this lightweight goal,
      the burden of parsing generic XML subscription requests and generating
      arbitrary XML is too complex. This document provides a basic profile
      that eliminates the requirement of a KPML server to parse arbitrary
      subscription requests or generate arbitrary XML documents.</t>

      <t>Of course, we strongly suggest implementing the full KPML protocol.
      However, this profile provides the benefits of KPML, namely not sharing
      the SIP dialog with the underlying SIP session. Note that by reporting
      on a digit-by-digit basis, quite a lot of bandwidth and packets are
      wasted. That said, with the exception of subscription establishment,
      this mechanism uses virtually identical bandwidth, and identical packet
      use, of INFO-based digit reporting schemes.</t>

      <t>We considered having the invite, offering a kpml-basic event, to
      automatically generate a subscription for the kpml-basic profile.
      However, this is not workable, because the client making the request has
      no way of correlating the automatically generated subscription to the
      underlying SIP session. This is differnt from the <xref
      target="RFC3515">REFER</xref> situation, where the new REFER dialog
      establishes the subscription dialog.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol Overview">
      <t>As a profile of KPML, the protocol operates identically to KPML.
      However, by advertising the kpml-basic event package, as opposed to
      kpml, the protocol described in this document superceeds the negotiation
      of KPML. In particular, the server MUST ignore any subscription body and
      substitute it with an expression similar to <xref
      target="F.request"></xref>. This matches every key press and reports on
      every key press.</t>

      <t>The server can optimize reporting by using a template XML document,
      substituting only the particular key press entered into the
      template.</t>

      <t>The client assumes a persistent subscription.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Event Package Formal Definition">
      <section title="Event Package Name">
        <t>This document defines a SIP Event Package as defined in <xref
        target="RFC3265">RFC 3265</xref>. The event-package token name for
        this package is:</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA["kpml-basic"
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section title="Event Package Parameters">
        <t>This package defines three Event Package parameters: call-id,
        remote-tag, and local-tag. These parameters MUST be present, to
        identify the subscription dialog. The User Interface matches the
        local-tag against the to tag, the remote-tag against the from tag, and
        the call-id against the Call-ID.</t>

        <t>call-id = "call-id" EQUAL ( token / DQUOTE callid DQUOTE
        )<vspace /> ;; NOTE: any DQUOTEs inside callid MUST be
        escaped!<vspace /> remote-tag = "remote-tag" EQUAL token<vspace />
        local-tag = "local-tag" EQUAL token</t>

        <t>If any call-ids contain embedded double-quotes, those double-quotes
        MUST be escaped using the backslash-quoting mechanism. Note that the
        call-id parameter may need to be expressed as a quoted string. This is
        because the ABNF for the callid production and the word production,
        which is used by callid (both from RFC 3261 [1]), allow some
        characters (such as "@", "[", and ":") that are not allowed within a
        token.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="SUBSCRIBE Bodies">
        <t>Applications using this event package have an empty body in the
        SUBSCRIBE request. The server MUST interpret this request as if it had
        a document requesting every possible single key press pattern. A
        sample of an application/kpml-request+xml document follows. Note if
        there are other defined digits, the server includes them in the
        pattern</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Subscription Duration">
        <t>The subscription lifetime should be longer than the expected call
        time. Subscriptions to this event package MAY range from minutes to
        weeks. Subscriptions in hours or days are more typical and are
        RECOMMENDED. The default subscription duration for this event package
        is 7200 seconds.</t>

        <t>Subscribers MUST be able to handle the User Interface returning an
        Expires value smaller than the requested value. Per <xref
        target="RFC3265">RFC3265</xref>, the subscription duration is the
        value returned by the Notifier in the 200 OK Expires header.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="NOTIFY Bodies">
        <t>NOTIFY requests MUST contain well-formed
        application/kpml-response+xml (KPML Response) bodies. The syntax of
        this body type is formally described in RFC 4730.</t>

        <t>The KPML server MAY use a template such as the following to send
        its responses.</t>

        <figure>
          <preamble></preamble>

          <artwork><![CDATA[?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

        "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:kpml-response kpml-response.xsd"

      digits="2"/>]]></artwork>

        </figure>

        <t>In the above example, the key pressed was a "2". Presumably, the
        KPML server would fill in the exact key pressed instead of the 2.</t>

        <t>It is very important to note the KPML client (the subscriber) MUST
        be capable of parsing arbitrary XML documents. There is no guarantee
        the server will use the above template. Since the server can use any
        legal, well-formed, application/kpml-response+xml template. There is
        no guarantee the server will use the above example as its
        template.</t>

        <t>Notifiers MAY send notifications with any format acceptable to the
        subscriber (based on the subscriber inclusion of these formats in an
        Accept header). A future extension MAY define other NOTIFY bodies. If
        no "Accept" header is present in the SUBSCRIBE, the body type defined
        in this document MUST be assumed.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Subscriber generation of SUBSCRIBE requests">
        <t>A kpml-basic request has no attached document.</t>

        <t>Because of the potentially sensitive nature of the information
        reported by KPML, subscribers SHOULD use sips: and MAY use S/MIME on
        the content.</t>

        <t>Subscribers MUST be prepared for the notifier to insist on
        authentication of the subscription request. Subscribers MUST be
        prepared for the notifier to insist on using a secure communication
        channel.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Notifier processing of SUBSCRIBE requests">
        <t>The user information transported by KPML is potentially sensitive.
        For example, it could include calling card or credit card numbers.
        Thus the User Interface (notifier) MUST authenticate the requesting
        party in some way before accepting the subscription.</t>

        <t>User Interfaces MUST implement SIP Digest authentication as
        required by <xref target="RFC3261">RFC3261</xref> and MUST implement
        the sips: scheme and TLS.</t>

        <t>Upon authenticating the requesting party, the User Interface
        determines if the requesting party has authorization to monitor the
        user's key presses. Determining authorization policies and procedures
        is beyond the scope of this specification.</t>

        <t>The User Interface returns a Contact URI that may have <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-sip-gruu">GRUU</xref> properties in the Contact
        header of a SIP INVITE, 1xx, or 2xx response.</t>

        <t>Following the semantics of SUBSCRIBE, if the User Interface
        receives a resubscription, the User Interface MUST terminate the
        existing KPML request and replace it with the new request.</t>

        <t>It is possible for the INVITE usage of the dialog to terminate
        during key press collection. The cases enumerated here are explicit
        subscription termination, automatic subscription termination, and
        underlying (INVITE-initiated) dialog termination.</t>

        <t>If a SUBSCRIBE request has an expires of zero (explicit SUBSCRIBE
        termination) and there is buffered User Input, the User Interface MUST
        generate the appropriate KPML report with the KPML status code of 200.
        The SIP NOTIFY body terminates the subscription by setting the
        subscription state to "terminated" and a reason of "timeout".</t>

        <t>If the SUBSCRIBE request has an expires of zero or the expires
        timer on the SUBSCRIBE-initiated dialog fires at the User Interface
        (notifier), then the User Interface MUST issue a KPML report with the
        KPML status code 487, Subscription Expired. This could be the null
        string.</t>

        <t>Per the mechanisms of <xref target="RFC3265">RFC3265</xref>, the
        User Interface MUST terminate the SIP SUBSCRIBE dialog. The User
        Interface does this via the SIP NOTIFY body transporting the final
        report described in the preceding paragraph. In particular, the
        subscription state will be "terminated" and a reason of "timeout".</t>

        <t>Terminating the subscription when a dialog terminates ensures
        reauthorization (if necessary) for attaching to subsequent
        subscriptions.</t>

        <t>If a SUBSCRIBE request references a dialog that is not present at
        the User Interface, the User Interface MUST generate a KPML report
        with the KPML status code 481, Dialog Not Found. The User Interface
        terminates the subscription by setting the subscription state to
        "terminated".</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Notifier generation of NOTIFY requests">
        <t>The User Interface (notifier in SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY parlance)
        generates NOTIFY requests based on the requirements of <xref
        target="RFC3265">RFC3265</xref>. Specifically, if a SUBSCRIBE request
        is valid and authorized, it will result in an immediate NOTIFY.</t>

        <t>The KPML payload distinguishes between an initial NOTIFY and a
        NOTIFY informing of key presses. If there is no User Input buffered at
        the time of the SUBSCRIBE (see below) or the buffered User Input does
        not match the new KPML document, then the immediate NOTIFY MUST NOT
        contain a KPML body. If User Interface has User Input buffered that
        result in a match using the new KPML document, then the NOTIFY MUST
        return the appropriate KPML document.</t>

        <t>The NOTIFY in response to a SUBSCRIBE request has no KPML if there
        are no matching buffered digits.</t>

        <t>All subscriptions MUST be authenticated, particularly those that
        match on buffered input.</t>

        <t>KPML specifies the key press notification report format. The MIME
        type for KPML reports is application/kpml-response+xml. The default
        MIME type for the kpml event package is
        application/kpml-response+xml.</t>

        <t>If the requestor is not using a secure transport protocol such as
        TLS for every hop (e.g., by using a sips: URI), the User Interface
        SHOULD use S/MIME to protect the user information in responses.</t>

        <t>Note that if the monitored (INVITE-initiated) dialog terminates,
        the Notifier still MUST explicitly terminate the KPML subscriptions
        monitoring that dialog.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Subscriber processing of NOTIFY requests">
        <t>If there is no KPML body, it means the SUBSCRIBE was successful.
        This establishes the dialog if there is no buffered User Input to
        report.</t>

        <t>If there is a KPML document, and the KPML status code is 200, then
        a match occurred.</t>

        <t>If there is a KPML document, and the KPML status code is between
        400 and 499, then an error occurred with User Input collection. The
        most likely cause is a timeout condition.</t>

        <t>If there is a KPML document, and the KPML status code is between
        500 and 599, then an error occurred with the subscription. See RFC
        4730 for more on the meaning of KPML status codes.</t>

        <t>The subscriber MUST be mindful of the subscription state. The User
        Interface may terminate the subscription at any time.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Handling of Forked Requests">
        <t>Forked requests are NOT ALLOWED for this event type. This can be
        ensured if the Subscriptions to this event package are sent to SIP
        URIs which have GRUU properties.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Rate of notifications">
        <t>The User Interface MUST NOT generate messages faster than 25
        messages per second, or one message every 40 milliseconds. This is the
        minimum time period for MF digit spills. Even 30-millisecond DTMF, as
        one sometimes finds in Japan, has a 20-millisecond off time, resulting
        in a 50-millisecond interdigit time.</t>

        <t>The sustained rate of notification shall be no more than 100
        Notifies per minute.</t>

        <t>The User Interface MUST reliably deliver notifications. Because
        there is no meaningful metric for throttling requests, the User
        Interface SHOULD send NOTIFY messages over a congestion-controlled
        transport, such as TCP. <list>
            <t>Note that all SIP implementations are already required to
            implement SIP over TCP.</t>

      <section title="State Agents and Lists">
        <t>KPML requests are sent to a specific SIP URI, which may have GRUU
        properties, and attempt to monitor a specific stream that corresponds
        with a specific target dialog. Consequently, implementers MUST NOT
        define state agents for this event package nor allow subscriptions for
        this event package to resource lists using the <xref

    <section anchor="S.security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The user information transported by KPML is potentially sensitive.
      For example, it could include calling card or credit card numbers. This
      potentially private information could be provided accidentally if the
      notifier does not properly authenticate or authorize a subscription.
      Similarly private information (such as a credit card number or calling
      card number) could be revealed to an otherwise legitimate subscriber
      (one operating an IVR) if digits buffered earlier in the session are
      provided unintentionally to the new subscriber.</t>

      <t>Likewise, an eavesdropper could view KPML digit information if it is
      not encrypted, or an attacker could inject fraudulent notifications
      unless the messages or the SIP path over which they travel are integrity
      protected.</t>

      <t>Therefore, User Interfaces MUST NOT downgrade their own security
      policy. That is, if a User Interface policy is to restrict notifications
      to authenticated and authorized subscribers over secure communications,
      then the User Interface must not accept an unauthenticated, unauthorized
      subscription over an insecure communication channel.</t>

      <t>As an XML markup, all of the security considerations of <xref
      target="RFC3023">RFC3023</xref> and <xref
      target="RFC3406">RFC3406</xref> must be met. Pay particular attention to
      the robustness requirements of parsing XML.</t>

      <t>Key press information is potentially sensitive. For example, it can
      represent credit card, calling card, or other personal information.
      Hijacking sessions allow unauthorized entities access to this sensitive
      information. Therefore, signaling SHOULD be secure, e.g., use of TLS and
      sips: SHOULD be used. Moreover, the information itself is sensitive;
      therefore the use of S/MIME or other appropriate mechanism SHOULD be
      used.</t>

      <t>Subscriptions MUST be authenticated in some manner. As required by
      the core <xref target="RFC3261">SIP</xref> specification, all SIP
      implementations MUST support digest authentication. In addition, User
      Interfaces MUST implement support for the sips: scheme and SIP over TLS.
      Subscribers MUST expect the User Interface to demand the use of an
      authentication scheme. If the local policy of a User Interface is to use
      authentication or secure communication channels, the User Interface MUST
      reject subscription requests that do not meet that policy.</t>

      <t>User Interfaces MUST begin buffering User Input upon receipt of an
      authenticated and accepted subscription. This buffering is done on a per
      subscription basis.</t>

            <t>This document describes a SIP Event Package "kpml" that enables
            monitoring of Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals and uses
            Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents referred to as Key
            Press Markup Language (KPML). The kpml Event Package may be used
            to support applications consistent with the principles defined in
            the document titled "A Framework for Application Interaction in
            the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)". The event package uses
            SUBSCRIBE messages and allows for XML documents that define and
            describe filter specifications for capturing key presses (DTMF
            Tones) entered at a presentation-free User Interface SIP User
            Agent (UA). The event package uses NOTIFY messages and allows for
            XML documents to report the captured key presses (DTMF tones),
            consistent with the filter specifications, to an Application
            Server. The scope of this package is for collecting supplemental
            key presses or mid-call key presses (triggers). [STANDARDS

          <abstract>
            <t>Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
            require a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI that
            can be used by anyone on the Internet to route a call to that
            specific UA instance. A URI that routes to a specific UA instance
            is called a Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU). This document
            describes an extension to SIP for obtaining a GRUU from a
            registrar and for communicating a GRUU to a peer within a
            dialog.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document describes a framework for the interaction between
            users and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based applications. By
            interacting with applications, users can guide the way in which
            they operate. The focus of this framework is stimulus signaling,
            which allows a user agent to interact with an application without
            knowledge of the semantics of that application. Stimulus signaling
            can occur to a user interface running locally with the client, or
            to a remote user interface, through media streams. Stimulus
            signaling encompasses a wide range of mechanisms, ranging from
            clicking on hyperlinks, to pressing buttons, to traditional Dual
            Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) input. In all cases, stimulus
            signaling is supported through the use of markup languages, which
            play a key role in this framework.</t>
