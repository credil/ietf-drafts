Internet-Draft      Version Navigation Link Relations      November 2009


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines link relations that may be used on a
   resource that exists in a system that supports versioning to navigate
   among the different resources available, such as past versions.


2.  Terminology

   Versioned Resource

      When a resource is put under version control, it becomes a
      "versioned resource".  A versioned resource can be "checked out"
      to allow modification.

   Version History

      A "version history" resource is a resource that contains all the
      versions of a particular versioned resource.

   Predecessor, Successor

      When a versioned resource is checked out and then subsequently
      checked in, the version that was checked out becomes a
      "predecessor" of the version created by the checkin.  A client can
      specify multiple predecessors for a new version if the new version
      is logically a merge of those predecessors.  The inverse of the
      predecessor relation is the "successor" relation.  Therefore, if X
      is a predecessor of Y, then Y is a successor of X.

   Working Copy

      A "working copy" is a resource at a server-defined URL that can be
      modified to create a new version of a versioned resource.


3.  Link Relations

   The following link relations are defined:

   version-history

      When included on a versioned resource, this link points to a
      resource containing the version history for this resource.

Internet-Draft      Version Navigation Link Relations      November 2009


   latest-version

      When included on a versioned resource, this link points to a
      resource containing the latest (e.g., current) version.

      The latest version is defined by the system.  For linear
      versioning systems, this is probably the latest version by
      timestamp.  For systems that support branching, there will be
      multiple latest versions, one for each branch in the version
      history.

      Some systems may allow multiple of these link relations.

   working-copy

      When included on a versioned resource, this link points to a
      working copy for this resource.

      Some systems may allow multiple of these link relations.

   predecessor-version

      When included on a versioned resource, this link points to a
      resource containing the predecessor version in the version
      history.

      Some systems may allow multiple of these link relations in the
      case of a multiple branches merging.

   successor-version

      When included on a versioned resource, this link points to a
      resource containing the successor version in the version history.

      Some systems may allow multiple of these link relations in order
      to support branching.


4.  Security Considerations

   Automated agents should take care when these relation crosses
   administrative domains (e.g., the URI has a different authority than
   the current document).


5.  IANA Considerations

   The link relations defined in Section 3 are to be registered by IANA

   All link relations defined in this document will have the following
   expected display characteristics:

      Undefined; this relation can be used for background processing or
      to provide extended functionality without displaying its value.

   The link relations defined in Section 3 correspond to various
   properties used in WebDAV Versioning [RFC3253] and JCR [JSR-283]:

   version-history

      WebDAV: the resource identified by the DAV:version-history
      property ([RFC3253], Sections 5.2.1 and 5.3.1).

      JCR: the node identified by jcr:versionHistory property
      ([JSR-283], Section 3.13.2.4) for versionable nodes, the parent

      folder for version nodes.

   latest-version

      WebDAV: for version-controlled resources, DAV:checked-in
      ([RFC3253], Section 3.2.1) or DAV:checked-out ([RFC3253], Section
      3.3.1), depending on checkin state.  For version resources, a
      successor version that itself does not have any successors.

      JCR: the version node identified by the jcr:baseVersion property
      ([JSR-283], Section 3.13.2.5) for versionable nodes; for version
      nodes, a successor version that itself does not have any
      successors.

   working-resource

      WebDAV: for version-controlled resources that are checked-out in
      place: the resource itself.  For version resources: each resource
      identified by a member of the DAV:checkout-set property (see
      [RFC3253], Section 3.4.3).

      JCR: for checked-out versionable nodes: the node itself.

   predecessor-version

      WebDAV: each resource identified by a member of DAV:predecessor-
      set ([RFC3253], Sections 3.3.2 and 3.4.1).

      JCR: each node identified by a member of jcr:predecessors
      ([JSR-283], Section 3.13.3.3).

   successor-version

      WebDAV: each resource identified by a member of DAV:successor-set
      ([RFC3253], Section 3.4.2).

      JCR: each node identified by a member of jcr:successors
      ([JSR-283], Section 3.13.3.4).

A.1.  Example: Use of Link Relations in HTTP Link Header

   The "Web Linking" specification ([draft-nottingham-http-link-header])
   generalizes Atom link relations, and also re-introduces the HTTP
   "Link" header as a way to expose link relations in HTTP responses.
   This will make it possible to expose version links independently from
   a specific vocabulary, be it the Atom Feed Format ([RFC4287]) or
   WebDAV properties ([RFC3253]).

   For instance, a response to an VERSION-CONTROL request ([RFC3253],
   Section 3.5) could expose newly created version-history and
   checked-in version as link relations:

   >> Request:


   VERSION-CONTROL /docs/test.txt HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.net


   >> Response:


   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Link: </system/v/84345634/1>; rel=latest-version;
         anchor=</docs/test.txt>
   Link: </system/vh/84345634>; rel=version-history;
         anchor=</docs/test.txt>


   (Note that in this case, the anchor parameter is used, as the
   response to a VERSION-CONTROL request is not a representation of the
   resource at the Request-URI)

   A subsequent HEAD request on that resource could expose the version-
   history and latest-version relations as well:

   >> Request:


   HEAD /docs/test.txt HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.net


   >> Response:


   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
   Content-Length: 12345
   Link: </system/v/84345634/1>; rel=latest-version
   Link: </system/vh/84345634>; rel=version-history


   After creating more versions, following the latest-version would then
   expose predecessors of a version:

Appendix C.  Change Log (to be removed by RFC Editor before publication)

C.1.  Since draft-brown-link-relations-00

   Added Geoff Clemm as author.

   Renamed link relation "all-versions" to "version-history".  Fixed
   description of "working-resource" relation to state that it appears
   on a version resource.

C.2.  Since draft-brown-link-relations-01

   Rewrite terminology and link relations using simpler definitions that
   can reflect versioning approaches different from WebDAV.

   Add JCR/WebDAV property table.  And reference to Web Linking draft
   (for now informative) and examples showing use of the Link header.
