    <abstract>
      <t>Before, during and after emergency situations various agencies need to provide information to a group of persons or to
        the public within a geographical area. While many aspects of such
        systems are specific to national or local jurisdictions, emergencies span such boundaries
        and notifications need to reach visitors from other jurisdictions.</t>
        
        <t>This document provides
          terminology, requirements and an architectural description for protocols exchanging alerts between IP-based end points.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">

      <section title="Classical Early Warning Situations">
        <t> During large-scale emergencies, public safety authorities need to reliably communicate
          with citizens in the affected areas, to provide warnings, indicate whether citizens should
          evacuate and how, and to dispel misinformation. Accurate information can reduce the impact
          of such emergencies. </t>
        <t> Traditionally, emergency alerting has used church bells, sirens, loudspeakers, radio and
          television to warn citizens and to provide information. However, techniques, such as
          sirens and bells, provide limited information content; loud speakers cover only very small
          areas and are often hard to understand, even for those not hearing impaired or fluent in
          the local language. Radio and television offer larger information volume, but are hard to
          target geographically and do not work well to address the “walking wounded” or other
          pedestrians. Both are not suitable for warnings, as many of those needing the information
          will not be listening or watching at any given time, particularly during work/school and
          sleep hours. </t>
        <t> This problem has been illustrated by the London underground bombing on July 7, 2006, as
          described in a government report <xref target="July2005"/>. The UK authorities could only
          use broadcast media and could not, for example, easily announce to the "walking wounded"
          where to assemble. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Exigent Communications">

        <t>With the usage of the term 'Exigent Communications' this document aims to generalize the
          concept of conveying alerts to IP-based systems and at the same time to re-define the
          actors that participate in the messaging communication. More precisely, exigent
          communications is defined as: </t>
        <t>
          <list style="empty">
            <t> Communication that requirs immediate action or remedy. Information about the reason
              for action and details about the steps that have to be taken are provided in the alert
                message.<vspace blankLines="1"/>
            </t>
            <t>An alert message (or warning message) is a cautionary advice about something imminent
              (especially imminent danger or other unpleasantness). In the context of exigent
              communication such an alert message refers to a future, ongoing or past event as the
              signaling exchange itself may relate to different stages of the lifecycle of the
              event. The alert message itself, and not the signaling protocol that convey it, provides sufficient
              context about the specific state of the lifecycle the alert message refers to.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>There are two types of basic communication models utilized for the distribution of alert messages and relevant for this document:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Alert Push Communication:">With this alert communication paradigm alert messages are sent to typically many Recipients without a prior explicit communication exchange soliciting the desire to receive the alerts. Typically, the criteria for becoming a Recipient are based on current location of the Recipient itself since alerts are targeted to a specific geographical region (an area immediately relevant to the emergency event). <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
            <t hangText="Alert Subscription Communication">The alert distribution in this category assumes that the 
            Recipient has indicated interest in receiving certain type of alerts using a protocol mechanism (for example, a subscribe event).
            This opt-in subscription model allows Recipients to sign-up for receiving alerts independently of their current geographical location. 
            For example, parents may want to be alerted of emergencies
              affecting the school attended by their children and adult children may need to know
              about emergencies affecting elderly parents.
                    
           </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
         Note that the Receivers of the alerts may not necessarily be the typical end devices humans carry around, such as 
             mobile phones, Internet tablets, or laptops. Instead, alert distribution may well directly communicate with
              displays in subway stations, or electronic bill boards. When a Receiver obtains such an alert then it may not necessarily 
             need to interact with a human (as the Recipient) but may instead use the alert as input to another process  
           to trigger automated behaviors, such as closing vents during a chemical
              spill or activating sirens or other warning systems in commercial buildings.
              </t>
        <t>This document provides
          terminology, requirements and an architectural description. 
        To avoid the bias towards a specific communication model or technology this documents utilizes the EMail architecture terminology from <xref
            target="RFC5598"/>.</t>

    <section title="Responsible Actor Roles">

      <t>The communication system used for the dissemination of alert messages builds on top of
        existing communication infrastructure. At the time of writing this underlying communication 
        infrastructure is the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). 
        These distributed services consist of a variety of
        actors playing different roles. On a high level we differentiate between the User, and the Message Handling Service (MHS) actors.
        We will describe them in more detail below.
     </t>
      <section title="User Actors">
        <t> Users are the sources and sinks of alert messages. Users can be people, organizations,
          or processes. There are three types of Users:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t> Authors </t>
            <t> Recipients </t>
            <t> Mediators </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>From the user perspective, all alert message transfer activities are performed by a
          monolithic Message Handling Service (MHS), even though the actual service can be provided
          by many independent organizations. </t>

        <section title="Author">
          <t> The Author is responsible for creating the alert message, its contents, and its
            intended recipients, even though the exact list of recipients may be unknown to the
            Author at the time of writing the alert message. The MHS transfers the alert message
            from the Author and delivers it to the Recipients. The MHS has an Originator role that
            correlates with the Author role. </t>
          <t>For most use cases the Author is a human creating a message.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Recipient">
          <t> The Recipient is a consumer of the delivered alert message. The MHS has a Receiver
            role that correlates with the Recipient role.</t>
            <t>For most use cases the Recipient is a human reading a message.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Mediator">
          <t> A Mediator receives, aggregates, reformulates, and redistributes alert messages among
          </t>
          <t> A Mediator attempts to preserve the original Author's information in the message it
            reformulates but is permitted to make meaningful changes to the message content or
            envelope. The MHS sees a new message, but users receive a message that they interpret as
            being from, or at least initiated by, the Author of the original message. The role of a
            Mediator is not limited to merely connecting other participants; the Mediator is
            responsible for the new message. </t>
          <t> A Mediator's role is complex and contingent, for example, modifying and adding content
            or regulating which users are allowed to participate and when. The common example of
            this role is an aggregator that accepts alert messages from a set of Originators and
            distributes them to a potentially large set of Recipients. This functionality is similar
            to a multicast, or even a broadcast. Recipients might have also indicated their interest
            to receive certain type of alerts messages or they might implicitly get entitled to
            receive specific alerts purely by their presence in a specific geographical region.
            Hence, a Mediator might have additional information about the Recipients context and
            might therefore be able to make a decision whether the Recipient is interested in
            receiving a particular alert message. </t>
          <t> A Gateway is a particularly interesting form of Mediator. It is a hybrid of User and
            Relay that connects to other communication systems. Its purpose is to emulate a Relay.
          </t>
        </section>

      </section>

      <section title="Message Handling Service (MHS) Actors">
        <t> The Message Handling Service (MHS) performs a single end-to-end transfer of warning
          messages on behalf of the Author to reach the Recipient addresses. 
          As a pragmatic heuristic MHS actors actors generate, modify or look at only
          transfer data, rather than the entire message. </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="actors-figure"/> shows the relationships among transfer participants.
          Although it shows the Originator as distinct from the Author and Receiver as distinct from
          Recipient, each pair of roles usually has the same actor. Transfers typically entail one
          or more Relays. However, direct delivery from the Originator to Receiver is possible.
          Delivery of warning messages within a single administrative boundary usually only involve
          a single Relay. </t>

        </t>

        <section title="Originator">
          <t> The Originator ensures that a warning message is valid for transfer and then submits
            it to a Relay. A message is valid if it conforms to both communication and warning
            message encapsulation standards and local operational policies. The Originator can
            simply review the message for conformance and reject it if it finds errors, or it can
            create some or all of the necessary information. </t>
          <t> The Originator serves the Author and can be the same
            entity. But its role in assuring validity means that it also represents the local
            operator of the MHS, that is, the local ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD). </t>
          <t> The Originator also performs any post-submission, Author-related administrative tasks
            associated with message transfer and delivery. Notably, these tasks pertain to sending
            error and delivery notices, enforcing local policies, and dealing with messages from the
            Author that prove to be problematic for the Internet. The Originator is accountable for
            the message content, even when it is not responsible for it. The Author creates the
            message, but the Originator handles any transmission issues with it. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Relay">
          <t> The Relay performs MHS-level transfer-service routing and store-and-forward, by
            transmitting or retransmitting the message to its Recipients. The Relay may add history
            information (e.g., as available with SIP History Info <xref
              target="RFC4244"/>) or security related protection (e.g., as available with SIP
            Identity <xref target="RFC4474"/>) but does not modify the envelope information or the
            message content semantics. </t>
          <t> A Message Handling System (MHS) network consists of a set of Relays. This network is
            above any underlying packet-switching network that might be used and below any Gateways
            or other Mediators. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Gateway">
          <t> A Gateway is a hybrid of User and Relay that connects heterogeneous communication
            infrastructures. Its purpose is to emulate a Relay and the closer it comes to this, the
            better. A Gateway operates as a User when it needs the ability to modify message
            content. </t>
          <t> Differences between the different communication systems can be as small as minor
            syntax variations, but they usually encompass significant, semantic distinctions. Hence,
            the Relay function in a Gateway presents a significant design challenge, if the
            resulting performance is to be seen as nearly seamless. The challenge is to ensure
            user-to-user functionality between the communication services, despite differences in
            their syntax and semantics. </t>
          <t> The basic test of Gateway design is whether an Author on one side of a Gateway can
            send a useful warning message to a Recipient on the other side, without requiring
            changes to any components in the Author's or Recipient's communication service other
            than adding the Gateway. To each of these otherwise independent services, the Gateway
            appears to be a native participant. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Receiver">
          <t> The Receiver performs final delivery or sends the warning message to an alternate
            address. In case of warning messages it is typically responsible for ensuring that the
            appropriate user interface interactions are triggered. </t>
        </section>
      </section>
      
      <!-- 
      <section title="Administrative Actors">
        <t> Administrative actors can be associated with different organizations, each with its own
          administrative authority. This operational independence, coupled with the need for
          interaction between groups, provides the motivation to distinguish among ADministrative
          Management Domains (ADMDs). Each ADMD can have vastly different operating policies and
          trust-based decision-making. One obvious example is the distinction between warning
          messages that are exchanged within an closed group (such as alert messages received by
          parents affecting the school attended by their children) and warning messages that
          exchanged between independent organizations (e.g., in case of large scale disasters). The
          rules for handling both types of traffic tend to be quite different. That difference
          requires defining the boundaries of each, and this requires the ADMD construct. </t>
        <t> Operation of communication systems that are used to convey alert messages are typically
          carried out by different providers (or operators). Each can be an independent ADMD. The
          benefit of the ADMD construct is to facilitate discussion about designs, policies and
          operations that need to distinguish between internal issues and external ones. Most
          significant is that the entities communicating across ADMD boundaries typically have the
          added burden of enforcing organizational policies concerning external communications. At a
          more mundane level, routing mail between ADMDs can be an issue, such as needing to route
          alert messages between organizational partners over specially trusted paths. </t>
        <t> The interactions of ADMD components are subject to the policies of that domain, which
          cover concerns such as these:</t>

      <t>The requirements for the two main communication models are different and reflected in
        separate sub-sections. For the Alert Push commnication model  <xref target="push"/> the assumption is that the potential recipient's consent to provide alerts has been obtained a-priori and the message customization has externally been defined. There is no separate protocol exchange to indicate preferences. The consent may have been waived by law or has been provided when the receipient has registered for a service. As an alternative approach, the Alert Subscription communication model <xref target="sub"/> allows the potential alert receipient to indicate preferences about the type of alerts it is interested in. This mechanism to express interest is provided as part of the protocol exchange, namely via a subscription.</t>

    <section title="Security considerations" toc="default" anchor="section-security">
    
    <t>With the distribution of alert messages a number of security threats need to be addressed. Because of the nature of alerts it is quite likely that end device implementations will want to provide user interface enhancements to get the attention whenever an alert arrives. This creates additional attractiveness for adversaries to exploit an alert Message Handling System. We list the most important threats below that any solution will have to deal with.
    </t>
    
   <t>
    <list style="hanging"> 
       <t hangText="Originator Impersonation:">
              <vspace blankLines="1"/> An attacker could then conceivably attempt to impersonate
              the Originator of an alert message. This threat is particularly applicable to those deployment environments where authorization decisions are based on the identity of the Originator.<vspace
                blankLines="1"/>
            </t>
            
             <t hangText="Alert Message Forgery:">
              <vspace blankLines="1"/> An attacker could forge or alter an alert message in order
              to convey custom messages to Recipients to get their immediate attention.<vspace
                blankLines="1"/>
            </t>

   <t hangText="Replay:">
              <vspace blankLines="1"/>An attacker could obtain previously distributed alert messages and to replay them at a later time in the hope that Recipients could be tricked into believing they are fresh. <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

 <t hangText="Unauthorized Distribution:">
              <vspace blankLines="1"/> When a Receiver receives an alert message it has to determine
              whether the Author distributing the alert messages is genuine to avoid accepting
              messages that are injected by malicious entities with the potential desire to at least
              get the immediate attention of the Recipient.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

 <t hangText="Amplification Attack:">
              <vspace blankLines="1"/>An attacker may use the Message Handling System to inject a single alert message for distribution that may then be instantly turned into potentially millions of alert messages for distribution. 
              </t>
              </list> 
              </t>
              
    <t>One important security challenge worth mentioning is related to authorization. When an alert message arrives at a Receiver, a software module at a host, then certain security checks can be performed to ensure that the message meets certain criteria. The final consumer of the alert message is, however, the Recipient, which in many cases is a human. From a security point of view the work split between the Recipient and the Receiver for making the authorization decision is important and the clarification of when to drop a message due to a failed security verfication by the Receiver. False positives may be fatal but accepting every alert message lowers the trustworthiness in the overall system.
