1.  Introduction

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  NoMail Policy

   The NOMAIL policy is declared in an SSP record using the tag
   "NOMAIL".

   No parameters are specified for the NOMAIL policy.

   If specified the NOMAIL policy states that no mail is sent from the
   domain to which it is attached.  All mail that purports to have been
   sent by that domain MUST be considered suspicious.


3.  Acknowledgements

   The ideas in this document arose from extensive discussions with the
   DKIM working group, in particular Hector Santos and others.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests allocation of a DKIM SSP tag 'NOMAIL'


5.  Security Considerations

   The NOMAIL policy MAY be employed to perform a denial of service
   attack.


6.  Normative References

   [RFC2119]  Bradner, S., "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate
              Requirement Levels", BCP 14, RFC 2119, March 1997.
