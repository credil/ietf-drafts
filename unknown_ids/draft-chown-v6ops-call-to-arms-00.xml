The Internet Society (ISOC) has declared that June 8th 2011 will be
World IPv6 Day, on which organisations are being encouraged to test their
production IPv6 deployment capability.   Many significant content providers
and networks have stated they will take part.  Given this date is likely
to see more IPv6 traffic flowing across the Internet than has ever been
seen before, it seems timely to issue a call to arms to review the status
of ongoing open issues in IPv6 deployment.   In this discussion document
we list identified issues in IPv6 operations that may give rise to 
observed problems on June 8th.  The World IPv6 Day should also 
create an excellent opportunity to observe the behaviour and performance
of IPv6; it is thus very desirable to have appropriate measurement tools
in place.

<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
Despite the recent exhaustion of the available IPv4 address pool, 
deployment of IPv6 remains limited.  To help encourage organisations
to trial production deployment, ISOC has declared June 8th 2011 as
World IPv6 Day.  Organisations are encouraged to use this day to
test IPv6 in production, either by enabling clients in their network,
or by making externally-facing services available over IPv6.   This
does not generally mean turning off IPv4 at this stage, rather enabling
dual-stack networking.  However IPv6-only networks are inevitable, and
some sites may choose to use June 8th to undertake some focused tests
on that deployment model.
	</t>
	<t>
The purpose of this document is two-fold.  One is to discuss common
IPv6 deployment issues that are likely to arise on June 8th, with a
focus on dual-stack deployment (which is likely to be how the vast majority
of sites take part).  This should help raise awareness of those problems
and possible mitigations.  The other is to encourage organisations to think
about how they might get useful instrumentation on what happens in and
to/from their networks on the day.   Such measurement tools are likely 
to also be useful longer term - once deployed they could be left in
place.
	</t>
	<t>
For most sites providing content, June 8th will be a chance to make
some public facing services available over IPv6, such as web content
using their production
domain (e.g. www.example.com) rather than a contrived IPv6 test domain
(e.g. www.ipv6.example.com).  Some enterprise sites may choose to 
enable IPv6 in user/client subnets, in which case the performance of
those systems and the applications they run will be of paramount interest.
	</t>
	<t>
This document is not intended to cover all IPv6 deployment issues,
e.g. debates on DHCPv6 versus RAs, rather to focus on those that affect
IPv6 connectivity, to raise awareness of these, and potential mitigations.
	</t>
	<t>
NB. This is a very rough first draft of the document; feedback is welcomed.
The scope of the document is purely informational to provoke discussion.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Connectivity">
	<t>
In this section we review causes of some common connectivity issues.
	</t>

<section title="Unmanaged Tunnels">
	<t>
One cause of connectivity problems is the use of unmanaged tunnels,
in particular 'automated' methods that are not provisioned by the
user's ISP.   The most common example is 6to4 <xref target="RFC3056"/>,
or more specifically the 6to4 relay approach described in 
<xref target="RFC3068"/>.  If a host in a native IPv6 network has
no route to 2002::/16 it cannot respond to 6to4 traffic it receives.
Similarly, a 6to4 router that cannot reach the well-known IPv4 anycast
relay address cannot respond to traffic it receives from native IPv6
networks.
	</t>
	<t>
One approach to this problem is to encourage sites/ISPs to run local
relays, as discussed in
<xref target="I-D.carpenter-v6ops-6to4-teredo-advisory"/>.  The
alternative to reduce such problems is simply to obsolete 6to4, as
proposed in 
<xref target="I-D.troan-v6ops-6to4-to-historic"/>.  
	</t>
	<t>
It is worth noting that IPv6 tunnel brokers, such as those provided
by SixXS (http://www.sixxs.net)  and Hurricane Electric 
(http://tunnelbroker.net) provide a more robust, managed approach
to IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnelled access.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Connection Timeouts">
	<t>
Where dual-stack systems - or rather the applications running on them -
have a choice of IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity, timeouts can occur if there
is no connectivity on the preferred protocol.  For example, if a AAAA
DNS record exists for a web server, and IPv6 connectivity is broken,
there is likely to be some timeout for the browser before the connection
drops back to IPv4.   
	</t>
	<t>
The author has undertaken some informal tests at his own site, which
shows that shows how different operating systems handle ICMP unreachables.
On Linux, web connections timeout after 20 seconds for 'no response',
but immediately for unreachables.  In contrast, Windows Vista was 20
seconds regardless of unreachables being received.  Any non-trivial
delay will cause significant user frustration.
	</t>
	<t>
An interesting solution to the problem is the 'happy eyeballs'
approach described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-happy-eyeballs"/>.
This approach is now also being suggested for multiple interface
systems.   However some people feel this 'workaround' is simply masking
underlying problems that should be fixed.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="PMTU Discovery">
	<t>
IPv6 mandates that fragmentation is only undertaken by the sending node,
and thus IPv6 requires working PMTU Discovery.  An existing RFC gives
Recommendations for Filtering ICMPv6 Messages in
Firewalls <xref target="RFC4890"/>.   If this guidance is not followed,
connectivity problems are likely to arise.  Blindly filtering all
ICMPv6 messages is not good practise.   The minimum MTU for IPv6
is 1280 bytes.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Rogue Router Advertisements">
	<t>
Within a site, hosts may use IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
(SLAAC).   However, it is possible for accidental (or malicious)
rogue RAs to cause connectivity issues, as described in
Rogue Router Advertisement Problem Statement <xref target="RFC6104"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
One solution to this problem is RA Guard <xref target="RFC6105"/>,
another is use of SEcure Neighbour Discovery (SEND) <xref target="RFC3971"/>.
However neither of these is widely implemented yet.  Indeed, any
reported operational experience of SEND in an enterprise network
would be very welcome.
	</t>
</section>

</section>




<section title="Instrumentation">
	<t>
In this section we discuss potential instrumentation approaches that
may be configured for World IPv6 Day, and then retained longer term
after the event.
	</t>

<section title="IPv6 traffic levels">
	<t>
It should be possible to measure IPv6 traffic levels independently on
dual-stack switch/router platforms, given implementations of 
appropriate MIBs.
	</t>
	<t>
Application level measurement is also desirable, e.g. the ability of
web log analysis packages to differentiate IPv4 and IPv6 visits.
If a site is making a specific application available for World IPv6
Day, it should be able to measure the IPv6 
activity seen on that service.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="Client Web Access Success Rate">
	<t>
There have been some recent studies on the capabilities of web clients
to access content on dual-stack servers by IPv4, IPv6 or IPv6 in the
presence of both A and AAAA records existing for a web domain.   
	</t>
	<t>
This section will be expanded to include examples of measurement
approaches.
	</t>
</section>

<section title="IPv4 Performance Comparison">
	<t>
Where a dual-stack service is deployed, measuring the relative performance
of both protocols is desirable.  This may primarily be a measurement of
throughput or delay, but may also include availability/uptime measurement.
	</t>
	<t>
Sites enabling IPv6 in clients should be aware that the volume of
IPv6 traffic they may use on World IPv6 Day may be somewhat
higher than normal, if in particular they are not part of the
existing Google IPv6 programme and they start viewing all YouTube
conent over IPv6.  A site's IPv6 capacity should thus match its
available IPv4 capacity; software tunneling of IPv6 over IPv4 may
cause problems if traffic levels do rise significantly.
	</t>
</section>


</section>


<section title="IPv6-only testing">
	<t>
The long-term IPv6 deployment plan is IPv6-only networking, rather than
dual-stack.  It is not clear how quickly significant IPv6-only networks
will emerge, but testing of approaches to IPv6-only operation is
desirable as soon as possible.
	</t>
	<t>
Some experience of NAT64 has been described in
<xref target="I-D.tan-v6ops-nat64-experiences"/>,
though this appears to have used only NAT-PT so far.
An implementation of NAT64 is available at http://ecdysis.viagenie.ca.
Operational experience of IVI is also desirable.  An implementation
of IVI is available at http://www.ivi2.org/IVI.
	</t>

<section anchor="Conclusions" title="Conclusions">
	<t>
With the ISOC World IPv6 Day event due on June 8th 2011, this document aims 
to help focus attention on both improving awareness and mitigations of
common causes of IPv6 connectivity problems, and encouraging sites and
organisations to introduce appropriate instrumentation into their networks
so they can observe traffic behaviour appropriately.
