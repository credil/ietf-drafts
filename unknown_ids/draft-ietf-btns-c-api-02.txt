1.  Overview

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Objects involved

   There are two major kinds of objects that are defined by this
   document.  These are the Protection Token (pToken) and the Identity
   Token (iToken).  Both objects are abstracted into unique opaque
   tokens which may be manipulated only indirectly by applications.

   Each object has a series of attributes associated with it.  The API
   provides a mechanism to query the value of attributes of the token.
   The attributes are where all of the content of the objects are.

   Each token has a scope - the place and time in which it can be
   considered valid.  There are many conflicting qualities that one
   would wish for the token, and the result is a different compromise
   among these qualities for each token type.  The tokens should be:

      small

      easy to allocate and deallocate

      automatically cleaned up when an application terminates (both
      properly and inproperly)

      easily compared

      easily passed back in a recvmsg(2) call as auxiliary data (for
      pToken)

3.1.  Scope of Protection Token

   The protection token has a per-process (i.e. per-address space)
   scope.  The scope of the token is not related to the underlying
   protection provided by IPsec.  The token is a handle.

3.2.  Scope of Identity Token

   The identity token has a per-system scope, although two applications
   running on the same system may not be able to compare it literally.

3.3.  Validity period of Protection Token

   The pToken is valid only within the scope of a single process.  The
   token may not be saved in any long term storage.

   It is permitted for one protection token to be replaced with another
   (equivalent) protection token due to a node moving, suspending and
   resuming, or due to extended network outages, however the underlying
   identity token would be guaranteed to be the same.  This would most

   likely occur with unconnected sockets, where due to the outage/
   downtime, the keying system was unable to maintain a keying channel,
   and had to re-create the keys from scratch.

3.4.  Validity period of Identity Token

   The iToken may be valid across the entire system, although it may
   need to be turned into an external representation.  Some forms of
   identity token may be valid across systems, but in general an
   identity token is only valid in reference to a local set of trust
   anchors.  (See [RFC2692]).

4.  Namespace

   All functions and macros defined by this API are prefixed with
   "ipsec_" for functions and variables, and with "IPSEC_" if they are
   macros or enumerated types. (cf. to appropriate POSIX section?)

   Whenever sensible, the enumerated values defined in [RFC2367] are
   used if appropriate.

5.  pToken discovery

   An application that receives a connection using accept(2), or with
   recvmsg(2) needs to get a protection token that is associated with
   the socket.

   For connected sockets (such as TCP and some SCTP modes), the
   protection token should not change during the lifetime of the socket,
   so a simple process is appropriate.

   For unconnected sockets (such as UDP and some SCTP modes), each
   datagram received may be received may arrive from a different source,
   and therefore may have different protections applied.  A protection
   token needs to be returned with each datagram, so it must be returned
   as ancilliary data with recvmsg(2).

   For connected sockets, the pToken will not change during the
   connection. (see notes about rekeying).  A simple function is
   provided to return a pToken from a file descriptor.  Many
   implementions are likely to implement this using getsockopt(2), but
   an interface in those terms is not specified in order to keep it
   somewhat abstract.
