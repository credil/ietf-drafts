Abstract

   Several approaches to transporting the ITU-T Q.931 User to User
   Information Element (UU IE) data in SIP have been implemented.  As
   networks move to SIP it is important that applications requiring this
   data can continue to function in SIP networks as well as the ability
   to interwork the information to/from ISDN for end-to-end
   transparency.  This document discusses the approaches and recommends
   a new header field User-to-User be standardized.  Example use cases
   include an exchange between two User Agents, insertion of UUI by a
   proxy, modification of UUI by a proxy.  An example application is in
   an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) in a contact center.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                    July 2008


1.  Overview

   This document describes the transport of User to User Information
   (UUI) in ISDN interworking scenarios using SIP [RFC3261].
   Specifically, we discuss the transport of call control related ITU-T
   Q.931 User to User Information Element (UU IE) [Q931] data in SIP.
   Five different use case call flows are discussed.

   It is important to note that standardization of the UUI content is
   explicitly out of scope for this specification.  For cases where the
   content of user to user information is relevant to SIP, it is
   expected a new SIP header field will be created to transport the
   information.  For example, location information is an example of user
   to user information, and obviously it needs to be transported in a
   specifically named SIP header rather than transported using this
   generic mechanism.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Use Cases

   This section discusses four uses cases for the transport of call
   control related user to user information.  What is not discussed here
   is the transport of non-call control UUI.  We define call control UUI
   as information that is generated, transported, and consumed at the
   time of call setup (i.e. during a pending INVITE transaction).  The
   information can be used for call routing, alerting, call
   distribution, or simply rendering.  The exact usage and semantics of
   call control UUI is out of scope - SIP is simply providing the
   transport function for this that ISDN Provides in the PSTN.  Non-call
   control UUI can be sent using the INFO method and not using the
   extensions described in this specification.

3.1.  User Agent to User Agent

   In this scenario, the originator UA includes UUI in the INVITE sent
   through a proxy to the terminating UA.  The terminator can use the
   UUI in any way.  If it is an ISDN gateway, it could map the UUI into
   the appropriate Q.931 element.  Alternatively, it might render the
   information to the user, or use it for alerting or as a lookup for a
   screen pop.  In this case, the proxy does not need to understand the

   UUI mechanism, but normal proxy rules should result in the UUI being
   forwarded without modification.  This call flow is shown in Figure 1.

              Originator              Proxy             Terminator
                   |                    |                    |
                   |   INVITE (UUI) F1  |                    |
                   |------------------->|   INVITE (UUI) F2  |

   Terminator.

3.2.  Proxy to User Agent

   In this scenario, proxy inserts the UUI into the INVITE from the
   originating UA which is then processed by the terminating UA.  The
   proxy can insert the UUI based on the identity of the originator, the
   time of day, the dialed URI or any other service specific information
   available when the INVITE is received.  This call flow is shown in
   Figure 2.

              Originator              Proxy             Terminator
                   |                    |                    |

                   |                    |------------------->|

3.3.  User Agent to Proxy to User Agent

   In this scenario, the originator UA includes UUI in the INVITE sent
   through a proxy to the terminating UA.  The proxy inspects the UUI in
   the INVITE and either modifies it or inserts new UUI.  This
   information is then processed by the terminating UA.  This call flow
   is shown in Figure 3.

   Terminator and modified by the Proxy.

3.4.  Redirection

   In this scenario, UUI is inserted by a redirect server which is then
   included in the INVITE sent by the Originator to the Terminator.  In
   this case, the Originator does not need to support the UUI mechanism
   but does need to support the SIP redirection mechanism used to
   include the UUI information.

   Figure 4.  Call flow with UUI exchanged between Redirect Server and
   Terminator

   A common application of this call flow is an Automatic Call
   Distributer (ACD) in a PSTN contact center.  The originator would be
   a PSTN gateway.  The ACD would act as a Redirect Server, inserting
   UUI based on called number, calling number, time of day, and other
   information.  The resulting UUI would be passed to the agent's
   handset which acts as the Terminator.  The UUI could be used to
   lookup information rendered to the agent at the time of call

   answering.

3.5.  Referral

   In this scenario, a Referrer UA causes an INVITE to be generated
   between the Originator and Terminator with UUI information inserted
   by the Referrer UA.  Note that this REFER [RFC3515] could be part of
   a transfer operation or it might be unrelated to an existing call,
   such as out-of-dialog REFER call control.  In some cases, this call
   flow is used in place of the redirection call flow, but where
   immediately upon answer, the REFER is sent.  This scenario is shown
   in Figure 5.

   Figure 5.  Call flow with transfer after answer.

   Some scenarios involving referral have been proposed to use a REFER
   sent during an early dialog. .  This NOT RECOMMENDED call flow is
   shown in Figure 6.  This flow is not recommended due to the number of
   messages exchanged (due to the REFER, CANCEL, and 487 responses) and
   the sending of the REFER in the early dialog.

4.  Possible Mechanisms

   Three mechanisms for transporting UUI will be described: MIME body,
   header field, and URI parameter transport.

4.1.  Why INFO is Not Used

   Since the INFO method [RFC2976]., was developed for ISUP interworking
   of user-to-user information, it might seem to be the logical choice
   here.  For non-call control user-to-user information, INFO can be
   utilized for end to end transport.  However, for transport of call
   control user-to-user information, INFO can not be used.  As the call

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                    July 2008


   flows in the previous section show, the information is related to an
   attempt to establish a session and must be passed with the session
   setup request (INVITE), responses to that INVITE, or session
   termination requests.  As a result, it is not possible to use INFO in
   these cases.

4.2.  MIME body Approach

   One method of transport is to transport the UUI information as a MIME
   body.  This is in keeping with the SIP-T architecture [RFC3372] in
   which MIME bodies are used to transport ISUP information.  However,
   in the SIP-T example, the body is added by the originator and used by
   the terminator.  Since the INVITE will normally have an SDP message
   body, the INVITE with SDP and UUI will be multipart MIME.  The
   insertion of a UUI message body by a proxy is not permitted by RFC
   3261.  The insertion of a UUI message body by a redirect server or in
   a REFER is difficult.  The body would need to be encoded in the
   Contact URI of the 3xx response or the Refer-To URI of a REFER.  For
   example:

  <allOneLine>
  Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?Content-Type=
  application/isup&body=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
  </allOneLine>

   Note that the <allOneLine> tag convention from SIP Torture Test
   Messages [RFC4475] is used to show that there are no line breaks in
   the actual message syntax.

4.3.  URI Parameter

   Another proposed approach is to encode the UUI as a URI parameter
   into the Contact or Refer-To URI.

  <allOneLine>
  Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com;uui=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6
  F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
  </allOneLine>

   The resulting INVITE would contain UUI in the Request-URI of the
   INVITE.  The URI parameter has a drawback in that a URI parameter
   will not survive retargeting by a proxy.  That is, if the URI is an
   Address of Record instead of a Contact URI, the URI parameter will
   not be copied over the Contact URI, resulting in the loss of the
   information.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                    July 2008


4.4.  Header Field Approach

   Another approach that has been proposed is to use a header field to
   transport the UUI information.  The header field would be escaped
   into the Contact or Refer-To URI.  The header field approach will
   work with the redirection, REFER, and proxy call flows.  The Call-
   Info header field is related to the UUI information.  However, there
   are a number of important differences:

      Call-Info is for rendering to the user.  While some of the UUI
      information may ultimately be rendered to the user, most of the
      UUI information will be consumed by the end device.
      Call-Info contains a URI pointer the information instead of the
      actual information itself.  UUI is always a small amount of data
      and must be carried with the request.

   For these reasons, a separate header field needs to be defined,
   described here as User-to-User.  For example, here is an example
   User-to-User header field from message F1 in Figure 1:

   User-to-User: 56a390f3d2b7310023a;encoding=hex

   For example, here is an escaped User-to-User header field from the
   redirection response F2 of Figure 4:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?User-to-User=
   56a390f3d2b7310023a%3Bencoding%3Dhex>
   </allOneLine>

   The resulting INVITE F5 would contain the User-to-User header field
   of the previous example.

   An escaped User-to-User header field from the REFER message response
   F1 of Figure 5:

   <allOneLine>
   Refer-To: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?User-to-User=
   56a390f3d2b7310023a%3Bencoding%3Dhex>
   </allOneLine>

   This would result in the INVITE F4 containing the User-to-User header
   field of the first example.


5.  Recommendation

   The recommendation is to define a new SIP header field User-to-User



Johnston & McMillen     Expires January 11, 2009                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                    July 2008


   to transport UUI information in ISDN interworking applications.

   The format of the UUI information is a topic of future
   standardization.  Currently, UUI is proprietary, requiring
   coordinated configuration between servers.  Standardizing the format
   or providing content tags would provide additional benefits.


6.  Appendix - Syntax for UUI Header Field

   Editor's Note: Eventually this text will move to a SIP Working Group
   document to define the new header field.

   The User-to-User header field can be present in INVITE requests and
   responses only and in BYE requests and responses.

   Current usage is to interoperate with ISDN User to User Signaling
   (UUS), a supplementary service in which manufacturer specific
   information is transported via the codeset 0 User-user Information
   IE.  Three services are defined: service 1, service 2, and service 3.
   This draft only addresses the SIP equivalent of service 1 although it
   could easily be expanded later to address services 2 and 3.  UUS
   Service 1 involves user to user signaling exchanged during call setup
   and clearing within the following Q.931 call control messages: SETUP,
   ALERT, CONNECT, DISCONNECT, RELEASE, and RELEASE COMPLETE.  UUS
   Service 2 involves user to user signaling exchanged during call
   establishment (between ALERT and CONNECT) via the USER INFORMATION
   message.  This service usually has a maximum of 2 USER INFORMATION
   messages in each direction.  UUS Service 3 involves user to user
   signaling exchanged on an active call via the USER INFORMATION
   message.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC 2234 and extends RFC 3261.

         UUI         = "User-to-User" HCOLON uui-data *(SEMI uui-param)
         uui-data    = token
         uui-param   = enc-param | generic-param
         enc-param   = "encoding=" ("hex" | token)

   Only one User-to-User header field may be present in a request or
   response.

   The only defined parameter for the User-to-User header field is the
   encoding parameter. "encoding=hex" is used to indicate that the UUI
   information is encoded as hex digits per the ISDN specification.  The
   first octet is the protocol discriminator).  Other encoding methods
   of encoding may also be standardized.

   Note that ISDN limits UUI to 128 octets in length.  While this header
   field has no such limitations, transporting UUI longer than 128
   octets will result in interoperability failures when interworking
   with ISDN.


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Registration of Header Field

   This document defines a new SIP header field named "User-to-User".

   The following row shall be added to the "Header Fields" section of
   the SIP parameter registry:


                 +------------------+--------------+-----------+
                 | Header Name      | Compact Form | Reference |
                 +------------------+--------------+-----------+
                 | User-to-User     |              | [RFCXXXX] |
                 +------------------+--------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   this document.

7.2.  Registration of Header Field Parameter

   This document defines a parameter for the header field defined in the
   preceding section.  The header field "User-to-User" can contain the
   parameter "encoding".

   The following rows shall be added to the "Header Field Parameters and
   Parameter Values" section of the SIP parameter registry:


   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
   | Header Field     | Parameter Name | Predefined Values | Reference |
   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
   | User-to-User     | encoding       | No                | [RFCXXXX] |
   +------------------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+

   Editor's Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   this document.


8.  Security Considerations

   User to user information can be exchanged over SIP on a hop-by-hop or



Johnston & McMillen     Expires January 11, 2009               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                    July 2008


   end-to-end basis.  In some cases, it may carry private information
   that may need confidential transport and integrity protection.
   Standard SIP security mechanisms can be used to secure this header
   field.  For example, TLS transport can provide single hop
   confidentiality and integrity protection.  For multiple hop or end-
   to-end confidentiality and integrity protection, S/MIME can be
   utilized.

   Information contained in a User-to-User header field should only be
   trusted if it is received within a trust domain.  For example,
   Spec-T, defined in [RFC3324] could be used to define a trust domain.
   When utilized by a gateway to map information to or from ISDN Q.931,
   appropriate policy should be applied based on the PSTN trust domain.
