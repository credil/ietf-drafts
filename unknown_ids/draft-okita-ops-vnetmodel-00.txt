Internet-Draft      Virtual Network Information Model          July 2009


Abstract

   Virtual switches on server virtualization platforms cause a problem
   in managing data center networks containing several hundred switches.
   Accordingly, a management information model for the network structure
   of data center networks containing virtual switches is proposed.  The
   proposed model consists of a physical layer (which represents
   connections between physical switches) and a virtual layer (which
   represents connections between virtual switches).  These layers also
   represent the association of the virtual switch with the
   corresponding physical switch.  The model shortens the virtual LAN
   (VLAN) configuration time taken by operators of data center networks
   by a maximum of 35%.  This result shows that the proposed model is
   effective in reducing the management time of data center networks
   containing virtual switches.

Internet-Draft      Virtual Network Information Model          July 2009


1.  Introduction

   In data center networks, a virtual switch on a server virtualization
   platform works as a virtual network element.  The virtual switch
   connects multiple virtual machines on the same server virtualization
   platform and connects these virtual machines to external physical
   switches.

   Virtual switches, however, cause a problem in managing data center
   networks because, mainly, a virtual switch and a physical switch
   require different management systems.  Operators of data center
   networks therefore have to use multiple management systems for
   managing the whole data center network.

   To avoid this management difficulty, an integrated network management
   system (NMS) is effective.  The integrated NMS collects and stores
   virtual-network management information that describes network
   structure of a managed target network.  It then displays or transmits
   this management information as a response to a request from operators
   or other NMSs.

   The purpose of this document is to provide a management information
   model that represents the network structure of a data center
   containing virtual switches.  Section 2 describes the model
   requirements, Section 3 defines the model, and Section 4 evaluates
   the model.

2.  Requirements

2.1.  Problem Statement

   Virtual switches cause a difficulty in managing data center networks.
   They expand the data center network into the server virtualization
   platforms.  Therefore, to manage the whole network structure of data
   center networks, network operators have to manage virtual switches in
   addition to physical switches.

   To manage these virtual and physical switches, operators have to use
   multiple management interfaces.  Specifically, to manage virtual
   switches, they have to use a specific management system for the
   server virtualization platform that the target virtual switches are
   created on.  Moreover, to manage physical switches, they use a
   network management system.  Figure 1 shows an architectural overview
   of a conventional data center network management system.

       Figure 1: Overview of a data center network management system

   This conventional management architecture causes the following two
   problems which increase the operation time taken by operators of the
   data center networks and thus increase operational costs.

   1.  When operators want to examine the network structure of a virtual
       network containing virtual switches, they have to access multiple
       management systems.

   2.  When operators want to examine the mapping of a virtual network
       to corresponding physical components, they have to access
       multiple management systems.

   To solve these problems and save the operation time for data center
   networks, the following two requirements must be met.

   1.  The data center network should provide an integrated management
       system that enables operators to get network structure
       information about virtual network.

   2.  The data center network should provide an integrated management
       system that enables operators to get mapping information about
       virtual switches and their underlying physical platforms.

2.2.  System Architecture Requirements

   A system architecture that effectively satisfies the above-described
   requirements is proposed in the following.

   An integrated network management system (NMS) effectively reduces the
   network operation time needed for managing virtual switches and
   physical switches.  It is referred to as a VNMS (Virtual Network
   Management System.)  It integrates multiple existing management
   interfaces into a single interface.  Operators can thus reduce their
   operation time.

   The VNMS manages device connectivity in the managed target network.
   To perform this task, it stores network management information about
   configured virtual networks in the target network.

   The following three types of elements exist around this VNMS.

   o  User clients or traditional NMS

   o  Network switches

   o  Server virtualization platforms

   The user client or network application uses management information
   about device connections in the managed network.  The network
   switches are virtualized as multiple virtual switches.  Moreover, the
   server virtualization platforms are virtualized as multiple virtual
   machines and internal virtual switches.  A set of virtual switches
   and virtual machines forms a virtual system for a user.

   Among the elements described above, we define the following two
   management interfaces.

   o  Network Management Interface (NMI)

   o  Device Management Interface (DMI)

   The network management interface (NMI) is set between the network
   application and the VNMS.  This interface is used by the VNMS to

   transport virtual-network management information to network
   applications in response to their request.

   The device-management interface (DMI) is set between the VNMS and
   network devices, which include the server virtualization platforms
   and network switches.  The DMI is used by the VNMS to query
   management information about a target device.  This interface is
   device specific and not standardized by this document.

   Figure 2 shows an overview of the system architecture of the target
   system.  The virtual-network management information about the VNMS is
   based on the proposed model .

2.3.  Requirements for Virtual Network Management Information Model

   This document focuses on an information model for the virtual-network
   management information described in the previous section.  The
   requirements for the information model are listed below.  These
   requirements arise from the two problems stated above.

   1.  The proposed model should represent a connection between virtual
       switches, a connection between physical switches, and a
       connection between a virtual switch and a physical switch in the
       target network.

   2.  The proposed model should represent mapping of a virtual switch
       to the physical server that the virtual switch is created on.

   In the next section, a virtual-network management information model
   for satisfying these requirements is proposed.

3.  Proposals of Virtual Network Management Information Model

   This section defines the proposed virtual-network management
   information model, which is an object-oriented information model.
   The model is an abstract-information model independent from encoding
   schemes and management protocols.  The model is written in Unified
   Modeling Language (UML) [UML] .

3.1.  TargetedNetwork Object

   The proposed model starts with a TargetedNetwork object.  This object
   represents the overall network.  In the network, two types of network
   exist: a physical network and a virtual network.  In the proposed
   model, a PhysicalNetwork object represents a physical network, and a
   VirtualNetwork object represents a virtual network.  To represent
   this structure, the TargetedNetwork object has one or multiple
   references to PhysicalNetwork objects and VirtualNetwork objects.

   Furthermore, the PhysicalNetwork object and the VirtualNetwork have a
   reference between them.  Since a physical network can create multiple
   virtual networks, the PhysicalNetwork object can have multiple
   references to corresponding VirtualNetwork objects.  On the contrary,
   the VirtualNetwork object has only one reference to the
   PhysicalNetwork object, since the virtual network is created on the
   specific physical network.

   Figure 3 shows a class diagram of the proposed virtual-network
   management information model containing the TargetedNetwork object,
   PhysicalNetwork objects, and VirtualNetwork objects.

3.2.  PhysicalNetwork Object

   To represent the structure of a physical network, the proposed model
   defines the following six types of managed objects under the
   TargetedNetwork object.

   o  PhysicalNetwork

   o  PhysicalNode

   o  PhysicalNodeGroup

   o  PhysicalInterface

   o  PhysicalInterfaceGroup

   o  PhysicalLink

   PhysicalNetwork:
         This object represents an actual network composed of actual
         devices.  This object aggregates zero or more PhysicalNode
         objects.

   PhysicalNode:
         This object represents an actual device in a physical network.
         The actual device is a server, a server virtualization
         platform, or a network switch.  The object has an association
         with a PhysicalNetwork object.  It also has an association with
         a PhysicalNodeGroup object when the actual device is a member
         of a group of devices.  It also aggregates zero or more
         PhysicalInterface objects.

   PhysicalNodeGroup:
         This object represents a set of multiple actual devices.  For
         example, this object represents the chassis of a blade server,
         which includes multiple server blades and multiple network
         switches.  This object aggregates one or more PhysicalNode
         objects.

   PhysicalInterface:
         This object represents an actual network interface of an actual
         device.  The network interface is a port of a network interface
         card equipped in a server or a port of a network switch.  The
         object also represents an internal network interface used to
         connect a server blade and an internal switch in a blade

         server.  This object has an association with a PhysicalNode
         object.  This object also has an association with a
         PhysicalInterfaceGroup object when the network interface is a
         port of the line card represented by the PhysicalInterfaceGroup
         object.  This object also has an association with a
         PhysicalLink object when the network interface is connected to
         another network interface by an actual network cable.

   PhysicalInterfaceGroup:
         This object represents a set of actual network interfaces.  For
         example, it represents a network interface card or a network
         switch's line card (which is equipped with multiple ports).  It
         aggregates one or more PhysicalInterface objects.

   PhysicalLink:
         This object represents an actual network cable used to connect
         two actual network interfaces.  For example, it represents a
         generic Ethernet cable.  It also represents an internal
         connection between a server blade and an internal switch in a
         blade server.  This object aggregates two PhysicalInterface
         objects.

   Figure 4 shows an abstract class diagram of the objects related to
   the physical network.

3.3.  VirtualNetwork Object

   To represent the structure of a virtual network, the proposed model
   defines the following five types of managed objects under the
   TargetedNetwork object.

   o  VirtualNetwork

   o  VirtualNode

   o  VirtualNodeGroup

   o  VirtualInterface

   o  VirtualLink

   VirtualNetwork:
         This object represents a virtual network composed of multiple
         virtual network devices, including not only actual devices but
         also virtual devices.  It aggregates zero or more VirtualNode
         objects.

   VirtualNode:
         This object represents a virtual network device in a virtual
         network.  Examples of the virtual devices are virtual switches
         and virtual machines on a server virtualization platform.
         Other examples are virtual-router functions configured on a
         router.  The object has an association with a VirtualNetwork
         object and a VirtualNodeGroup object.

   VirtualNodeGroup:
         This object represents a set of virtual devices that are
         created from the same actual device.  It aggregates one or more
         VirtualNode objects.  It also has an association with a
         PhysicalNode object, which represents an actual device.

   VirtualInterface:
         This object represents a virtual network interface of a virtual
         device.  An example of such an interface is a virtual network-
         interface card (VNIC) of a virtual machine on a server
         virtualization platform.  This object has an association with a
         VirtualNode object.  This object also has an association with a
         VirtualLink object when the virtual network interface is
         connected to another virtual network interface by a virtual
         network link.

   VirtualLink:
         This object represents a virtual network link used to connect
         two virtual network interfaces.  For example, it represents a
         connection between a virtual machine and a virtual switch
         created on a server virtualization platform.  This object
         aggregates two VirtualInterface objects.

   The relationship between the VirtualNetwork, the VirtualNode, the
   VirtualInterface, and this VirtualLink object is almost the same as
   the relationship between the PhysicalNetwork, the PhysicalNode, the
   PhysicalInterface, and the PhysicalLink object.

   Figure 5 shows an abstract class diagram of the objects related to
   the virtual network.

4.  Experiment

4.1.  Environment

   To confirm the applicability of the proposed model, a virtual network
   management system, deployed with virtual network information based on
   the proposed information model, was developed.  This system stores
   configuration information of the managed network and displays the
   contents of this information via a command line interface.  Operators
   can confirm the network structure with this system.

   In the experiment using the virtual network management system,
   operators made a virtual LAN (VLAN) configuration of switches in
   sample networks with and without the integrated NMS.  The operation
   time for each VLAN configuration operation was evaluated.

   Two sample networks containing multiple virtual machines were used.
   One of the networks corresponds to a small private network.  The
   other corresponds to a medium-sized enterprise network.  Table 1
   lists the parameters of these sample networks.

                Table 1: Parameters used in the experiment

   The sample network in example 1 consisted of an external physical
   switch, two internal physical switches, and four server blades in two
   blade-server chassis.  Each server blade ran a server virtualization
   platform.  The internal switches connected the two blades in the
   chassis, and the external switch connected these two internal
   switches.  Each virtualization platform operated two virtual
   machines.  On these server virtualization platforms, virtual switches
   connected an external physical switch and multiple virtual machines
   on the same platform .

   The sample network in example 2 consisted of four external switches,
   four internal switches, fourteen server blades in a four-blade server
   chassis.  Each server blade ran a server virtualization platform,
   each of which operated one or two virtual machines.  And four
   physical switches worked as an external gateway switch, a core

   Without the virtual-network management system, user 2 took 1,056
   seconds to make the VLAN configuration by adding a virtual machines
   VM3.0 and VM3.1 to a specified VLAN in example 1.

   In contrast, using the virtual-network management system, user 2
   reduced VLAN configuration time by 35%.  It took 676 seconds for the
   operator to make the VLAN configuration by adding a virtual machine
   to the specified VLAN in example 1.

   While performing the VLAN-configuration operation without the
   virtual-network management system, the operators had to access each
   management interface of the physical switch and server virtualization
   platforms or check the configuration sheet of the network.

   In contrast, while performing the operation with the virtual-network
   management system, the operators could read all the required
   management information from the management interface of the system.
   That is the main reason that the operation time was reduced.

5.  Summary

   This document proposes a management information model for a virtual
   network in a data center network.  This information model can
   represent the network structure of a virtual network composed of
   virtual switches and physical switches.  It can also represent the
   mapping between the virtual switch and the physical switch.

   The network management system, which manages virtual-network
   management information according to the proposed information model,
   reduced VLAN configuration time by 35%.  This result demonstrates
   that the virtual-network management information model is effective in
   reducing the management time of a data center network containing
   virtual switches.

   The proposed management information model does not contain
   implementation specifications.  Therefore, to implement the
   information model, developers have to select an encoding scheme and a
   management protocol for transporting management information data.
   For example, developers can use SNMP and MIB specified in the
   Internet-standard management framework [RFC3410] or an XML
   [W3C.REC-xml] -based management framework [RFC3535]

6.  Security Considerations

   The virtual-network management information as defined in this
   document provides administrative information about a data center
   network.  This information could be used to aid an attack on the
   network.

   It is assumed that accesses to the data defined in this document are
   subject to appropriate access control in the network management
   system.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The document does not request any IANA action, since the proposed
   model is an abstract information model.  However, a concrete data
   model based on this information model should request IANA actions if
   necessary.
