Abstract

   In IPsec, secure connectivity is provided for network layer entities.
   Traffic Selectors which specify interesting traffic for security
   association encapsulation are identified only by network and
   transport layer addressing.

   This document extends traffic selectors to allow more generic
   definitions of interesting traffic.

Internet-Draft       Multiprotocol Traffic Selectors           July 2009


1.  Introduction

   IPsec is focused on providing tunnel and transport security for
   network layer IP traffic based on IP address and port selectors.  In
   some circumstances, endpoints may wish to provide IPsec services
   based on other distinguishing information from the traffic stream
   [RFC4301].

   This document discusses models, motivations, for multiprotocol
   bindings for IPsec Traffic Selectors, their use in the Security
   Policy Database (SPD) and their description within IKEv2
   [RFC4306][I-D.ietf-ipsecme-roadmap].


2.  Description and Models

   Devices which may prefer to choose extended traffic selector syntax
   may support non-IP protocols for packet delivery or may have non-
   Address and port information used in traffic selection for IP layer
   traffic.

   Example 1 Diffserv

   Packets Classified using Diffserv may lose packets and reorder data
   based on their traffic classification.  Where different queuing
   mechanisms are available for different Diffserv Codepoints (DSCPs),
   anti-replay issues may arise for packets which are reordered within
   an SA.  This is described in Section 4.1 of [RFC4301].

   A mechanism which defines an SA for each of the path's queues would
   assist in this.  For a system with three different queues, dividing
   the traffic into three separate SAs may avoid this impact, as
   displayed below:


          TS: DSCP:46=>SA1                          TS: DSCP:46=>SA1
              DSCP:30-35=>SA2                           DSCP:30-35=>SA2
              DSCP:*=>SA3                               DSCP:*=>SA3
          +---------+                              +---------+
          |       46|                              |46       |
          |     /-->|------------------------------|<--\     |
          |    /    |=============================>|    \    |
          |   /30-35|            ESP SA1           |30-35\   |
   -------|< - - - >|------------------------------|> - - - >|-------
    ----> |   \     |=============================>|     /   | ---->
          |    \    |            ESP SA2           |    /    |
          |     \-->|------------------------------|<--/     |
          |       * |=============================>| *       |

          +---------+            ESP SA3           +---------+

   Packet loss or delay of any packet in a queue will not cause out of
   order reception in any of the Security Associations.  This allows
   packets which would have been discarded due to anti-replay windows to
   pass through to applications.

   Example 2 Ethernet Pseudo Wire

   For systems which do not contain IP addresses on the traffic side
   (rather than the carriage side), there is currently no way to specify
   IPsec connectivity across to a remote device.  This may be the case
   with Pseudo-wires which have shared identifiers, that are known at
   provisioning time.

   Allowing data associated with a particular interface group to be
   encapsulated in protocols such as ESP, would provide a mechanism to
   deliver secured pseudo wires.


            wire ID                                  wire ID
          +---------+                              +---------+
          |         |                              |         |
   -------|< - - - >|------------------------------|< - - - >|-------
    ----> |         |=============================>|         | ---->
          +---------+            ESP SA            +---------+

   Example 3 MPLS Label

   Where an MPLS label either arrives from an interface, or is used to
   encapsulate traffic, it may be useful to transport data carried
   within that label across the network.

   At this stage, advice is sought on how encapsulation would occur, and
   whether the communications path connecting A and B would make use of
   an MPLS label inside the ESP label.

   Similar to Diffserv in Example 1,the Traffic Class field of the MPLS
   label stack entry [RFC5462] may be used for traffic selectors.




          TS: Label A                              TS: Label B
          +---------+                              +---------+
      A   |         |                              |         |   B
   -------|< - - - >|------------------------------|< - - - >|-------

3.  Related work

   An Informational specification is available which shows how
   Fiberchannel Addressing can be used for traffic selectors in
   [RFC4595].  In Section 4.4, it defines TS_FC_ADDR_RANGE, which uses
   ranges of Fiberchannel addresses where other previously defined
   methods have used IP addresses.

   RFC 4595 also specifies transport of ESP (and AH) frames over
   Fiberchannel encapsulation.  Within this document discussion of
   carriage of IKEv2, ESP and AH over non IP or IP/UDP transport is out-
   of-scope.

   Descriptions of challenges and mechanisms for provisioning security
   on Pseudo-wires are available in [PWESECREQ][PWESEC].  This document
   takes a different approach to previous pseudo-wire security
   mechanisms in that it attempts to provide a more general key
   derivation mechanism for data other than pseudo-wires.  Additionally,
   this document doesn't seek to provide a non-IP carriage for ESP and
   ESP-like frames, as is the case in [PWESEC].

   It is notable that there exist link-layer encryption mechanisms
   available via IEEE LAN/MAN 802.1 Working Group [DOT1ae][DOT1XREV].
   This work doesn't seek to supplant existing link-layer security
   mechanisms, but does seek to allow for use of secured transports for
   non-IP data such as link-layer frames when used within the IPsec
   framework.


4.  Applicability

   This document aims at developing/exploring a canonical and extensible
   format which can be used by IKEv2 peers to define interesting
   traffic, and a means to define traffic match patterns for Security
   Policy Databases beyond the existing IP based means.

   This document does not define encapsulation of ESP or AH protocols
   over any new protocols, and only defines/discusses what may be
   encapsulated by them.

5.  Security Policy Database Considerations

   Security Policy Databases provide expressions of the encryption and
   authentication policy on IPsec hosts and gateways.  SPDs are
   referenced as part of packet delivery processes in order to match
   packets either to a constructed SA, or to the key-deriving system
   (such as IKEv2), based on interesting traffic matches.

   Databases therefore require an interface for packet processes when
   transmitting data [USAGIXFRM], configuration interfaces through which
   to construct policy [RFC4807][IPSECSPOL][SETKEY], and key derivation
   interfaces to ensure that policy is expressed through to the remote
   peer during the key exchange.

   At this stage, specification of inter device communication operations
   using IKEv2 is necessary if support for extended traffic selectors is
   to be provided.


6.  IKEv2 Considerations

   As a departure from IKE [RFC2407], IKEv2 specifies traffic selectors
   separate to identifiers [RFC4306], including for IPv4 and IPv6.

   In order to provide more general mapping for traffic selectors to
   non-IP sources and destinations, Traffic Selector Type (TS Type)
   allocation needs to be made.  The existing TS Type space is
   administered by IANA.  As of April 2009 there are 230 allocatable
   values within the space.

   Along with a selector type allocation the format within IKEv2 and
   interpretation of each traffic selector require specification.  This
   either requires a specific Traffic Selector option format, or a
   general format which can express additional classes of information.

   If a more expressive format were to be used, the syntax of this
   format could be used for the DSCP, MPLS Labels, or Pseudo-wire
   interchangeably.  An endpoint which could understand the format, but
   could not support a particular selector could down select or reject
   the proposal.

   RFC4807 Specifies an SNMP MIB for IPsec Security Policies [RFC4807].
   Within the specification is a mechanism to describe in ASN.1 encoding
   for IP Address and DSCP based traffic selectors [RFC3289].  Were the
   same encoding used for IKEv2 as the MIB, new object identifiers would
   need to be added, but the format would be predetermined.

   Another alternative is to use an XML Schema, although the mechanism



Daley, et al.            Expires January 4, 2010                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       Multiprotocol Traffic Selectors           July 2009


   would have to be able to present a single canonical syntax for a
   specific policy.


7.  IPsec Mode Considerations

   When constructing more elaborate traffic selectors for IKEv2, it is
   expected that the tunnel mode will be provided for traffic which
   doesn't travel within IP-layer packets.

   Traffic selectors for data carried within IP packets may still be
   carried in Transport Mode, for example if DSCPs are used for
   selectors.  This requires further investigation.


8.  Backward Compatibility

   One advantage of IPsec is that traffic descriptors for IPv4 and IPv6
   are available across the majority of existing implementations.
   Introduction of multiple subsets of Traffic Selectors which are
   optional to implement may cause compatibility issues.

   Security Policy Database entries for IPsec devices support IPv4 and
   IPv6 traffic selectors.  Traffic Selectors are either associated with
   static Security Associations, or are defined in conjunction with
   IKEv2 policy [RFC4301][RFC4306].

   Where keying and SA configuration are static, it is possible that
   traffic sent on an SA from a device supporting (and using) extended
   Traffic Selectors will be rejected upon reception at the far end SA.
   The reverse case (with legacy implementation ingress and general
   traffic selector egress) would have equivalent function, with only
   the intersection of the traffic selectors being allowed through to
   the remote site.

   Without an IKEv2 control channel this is not easily remedied.
   Similar issues regarding persistent differences in configuration are
   described in [RFC4306].  In the case that IKEv2 is used for key
   negotiation, a system which supports only IPv4, IPv6 or Fiber Channel
   Traffic Selectors will not be able to choose a traffic selector from
   the extended mechanisms.

   This may lead to Security Associations to fail completely, in
   conformance to the IKEv2 protocol [RFC4306].

9.  Discussion of Initiator/Responder Mappings

   Existing traffic selectors are for connectionless source and
   destinations.  Assignment of multiple selectors to each of the
   initiator and responder is appropriate for such traffic.  For systems
   which provide connection oriented point-to-point service, multiple
   sources and destinations are inappropriate.  In such a case, there
   needs to be a one-to-one mapping between initiator and responder
   traffic selectors.

   Expressed in existing IKEv2 syntax, it is not possible to describe
   within a single CHILD_SA Security Association Initiator and Responder
   Traffic Selectors elements which are mutually exclusive.

   For example, if:


   TSi is the set [ 192.0.2.0/26,  192.0.2.128/26 ]
   and TSr set is [ 192.0.2.64/26, 192.0.2.192/26 ]

   It is not possible to express in a single CHILD_SA or IKEv2 which has
   the properties that only:


         192.0.2.0/26  ===> 192.0.2.128/26   (A)
   and
         192.0.2.64/26 ===> 192.0.2.192/26   (B)

   while
         192.0.2.0/26  =/=> 192.0.2.192/26
   and
         192.0.2.64/26 =/=> 192.0.2.128/26

   In order to allow only a single source and destination mapping within
   IKEv2's syntax, the only way to specify mappings (A) and (B) are via
   two separate SAs.  For point-to-point circuit oriented connections
   such as pseudo-wires, given RFC 4306 IKEv2 syntax, would require an
   SA per source, destination pair.

   As described in Section 4.4.1.2 of RFC4301, the structure of SPDs
   identified within that system allows for multiple Selector Sets which
   may be included into a single security association.  As discussed
   within that document, in order to provision selector sets
   dynamically, changes need to be made within IKEv2.

   At this stage, provisioning one circuit per SA is described, although
   it is worth identifying if selector sets are viable under revision of
   the specification.

10.  External Interface Considerations

   Referral of packets to the security policy database is typically
   undertaken as a forwarding (routing) process in existing networks
   [RFC4301].  Defining Traffic Selectors with non-IP address components
   means that a different non-forwarding process may be invoked to refer
   to the SPD.

   When the forwarding process accesses the SPD, there is a transform on
   a received packet which determines whether the traffic is interesting
   to send over IPsec.  This will either invoke the IKEv2 key
   negotiation process, or assign the data to a security association (as
   described in Section 2.9 of RFC 4306 [RFC4306]).

   For forwarding and processes referring to the modified Security
   Policy Database, there needs to be a mechanism which allows the match
   new Traffic Selector attributes.  This match process would then be
   used as above, to invoke IKEv2 or to assign data for transmission.

   If individual mechanisms are defined through the process described
   below, each Traffic Selector Definition will require specification
   not only of the type, and its expression within IKEv2, but also the
   filtering and operational processes required to achieve effective
   traffic protection [RFC4306].

   Depending on the mechanisms defined for expressing extended traffic
   selectors, a general filtering mechanism may be defined which allows
   new selection filters to be applied to the SPD, and exchanged over
   IKEv2 using the Traffic Selector Payload [RFC2819].  The
   expressibility of the Traffic Selectors must then be matched by the
   filter mechanism, and map from the presented packet information to a
   PROTECT operation [RFC4301].

   Existing interfaces between the Security Policy Database and the key
   management process make implicit assumptions that the Traffic
   Selectors are IP addresses [RFC2367].  Modifications to such
   mechanisms may need to occur before existing APIs may be used with
   new traffic selectors.


11.  IANA Considerations

   In order to allocate a new traffic selector class, it is necessary to
   receive a traffic selector type allocation from IANA
   [RFC4306][IANAIKEV2].  This requires Expert Review by an IANA
   identified resource, who would be able to understand the use case,
   and whether the allocation should occur.

Internet-Draft       Multiprotocol Traffic Selectors           July 2009


12.  Security Considerations

   Definition of new traffic selectors for non-IP traffic isn't a
   significant departure from IKEv2's security model.  The identity
   associated with the communications, and the source and destination of
   the tunnel headers do not change.  Only the traffic identified for
   transport changes.

   Where non-IP datagrams are exchanged over ESP or AH tunnels, the
   behavior may be different to IP.  When providing connectivity through
   the IPsec tunnels for physical or link-layer technologies, the tunnel
   itself may establish alternative paths in the wider topology.

   Where the tunneled lower layer traffic expands on an existing
   infrastructure, there is a chance of loop creation.  Unless tunnel
   endpoints deploy mechanisms to prevent loops, data transfer through
   the tunnel could be used to trivially deny service to devices on the
   tunnel path, and the networks at either end.

   Where more complex filter patterns are expressible within the Traffic
   Selector IKEv2 payload, they may require decoding by an external
   parser.  Where an external parser for a language such as ASN.1 or XML
   is in use, there are additional interfaces to exploit, and a more
   complex structure to keep state about.  The cost of this additional
   risk needs to be balanced against the value in expressing more
   complex policy.
