Internet-Draft                NomCom Issues                   March 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), the Internet
   Architecture Board (IAB), and at-large IETF representatives to the
   IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) are selected by a
   "Nominating and Recall Committee" (universally abbreviated as
   "NomCom").  [RFC3777] defines how the NomCom is selected, and the
   processes it follows as it selects candidates for these positions.

   This document describes an issue with [RFC3777] that has arisen in
   practice, and proposes a normative update to resolve the issue.


2.  Background of this document

   [RFC3777] is the latest in a series of revisions to the NomCom
   process.  [RFC3777] has been updated once since 2004, but this update
   ([RFC5078] did not change normative text (it replaced a sample
   timeline).

   [RFC5078] identified a serial delay in the process described in
   [RFC3777], in section 4, "Nominating Committee Selection", bullet 13,
   which states:

      The Chair obtains the list of IESG and IAB positions to be
      reviewed and announces it along with a solicitation for names of
      volunteers from the IETF community willing to serve on the
      nominating committee.

      The solicitation must permit the community at least 30 days during
      which they may choose to volunteer to be selected for the
      nominating committee.

      The list of open positions is published with the solicitation to
      facilitate community members choosing between volunteering for an
      open position and volunteering for the nominating committee.

   The result is that the Chair is the only person who can announce the
   list of open positions and solicitation for names of volunteers, a
   process that requires 30 days for public solicitation.

   Since this is the first step in organizing the NomCom committee,
   delays in selecting a NomCom Chair translate directly into delays in
   issuing the solicitation and organizing the NomCom.

   This proved problematic in practice in 2008-2009, when Joel Halpern
   was named NomCom Chair less than 30 days prior to the Second IETF
   meeting.  If the 30-day solicitation had already taken place, Joel

Internet-Draft                NomCom Issues                   March 2009


   could have organized the NomCom at the Second IETF meeting, face to
   face, but since the required 30-day solicitation didn't start until
   Joel was named, Joel was forced to organize the NomCom by e-mail and
   conference call.

   It is desirable to allow the solicitation and announcement to take
   place in a timely manner so that when a NomCom Chair IS named, the
   NomCom Chair can immediately announce the source of selection
   randomness and quickly select voting volunteer members of the NomCom.


3.  Discussion

   This document proposes that the IETF Secretariat, not the current
   NomCom Chair, will issue the announcement of open positions and the
   solicitation for names of volunteers on behalf of the NomCom Chair
   who will be named by the ISOC President.  This allows the search for
   NomCom Chair and volunteers to proceed in parallel.

   This process change covers only the announcement of open positions
   and the solicitation for names of volunteers.  The announcement of
   the pool of volunteers and the source of randomness used to select
   voting volunteers is still the responsibility of the current Chair.
   The goal of this process change is *not* to allow the NomCom process
   to move to completion without a current Chair, it is only to ensure
   that a current Chair can begin organizing the NomCom without an
   avoidable delay, and can use face-to-face time at the Second IETF
   meeting effectively for this purpose.

   Note: Some of the comments on version 00 of this draft asked "why
   isn't the solution just to pick the NomCom Chair sooner?"  That's a
   reasonable question, and this proposal isn't intended to make NomCom
   Chair selection any less urgent.  On the other hand, the RFC 5078
   timeline for 2008 recommended sending out the announcement and
   solicitation on 2008/05/25, and Joel sent out his announcement and
   solicitation on 2008/07/15 - nearly two months later.  If that's a
   one-time occurrance, obviously this proposal isn't necessary.  On the
   other hand, the RFC 5078 dates are almost exactly the same in 2009-
   2010, so we'll know if there's a problem by 2009-05-24... :-|

   Note: Some of the comments on version 00 of this draft talked about a
   "slippery slope" - how far can the NomCom process go without a NomCom
   Chair?  Although it may make sense to assign additional
   administrative responsibilities to the IETF Secretariat (for example,
   publish a timeline or publish a mechanism for random selection of
   voting NomCom members), I've resisted proposing these changes, simply
   to limit the scope of changes to the NomCom process.

4.  Updated text from RFC 3777

   For [RFC3777], in section 4, "Nominating Committee Selection", bullet
   13, which states:

      The Chair obtains the list of IESG and IAB positions to be
      reviewed and announces it along with a solicitation for names of
      volunteers from the IETF community willing to serve on the
      nominating committee.

   this text is replaced with the following text:

      The IETF Secretariat obtains the list of IESG and IAB positions to
      be reviewed and announces it along with a solicitation for names
      of volunteers from the IETF community willing to serve on the
      nominating committee.

   Note: This text does not include modifications reflecting NomCom
   selection of IAOC members.  These modifications are being submitted
   in a separate Internet-Draft.


5.  Security Considerations

   This specification describes issues with the current IETF Nominating
   Committee process ([RFC3777]) and proposes an update to avoid a
   serial delay.  No security considerations apply.


6.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are requested in this specification.


7.  Acknowledgements

   The editor thanks the following folks who have provided useful
   observations and guidance on previous versions of this draft: Scott
   Bradner (who suggested that the IETF Secretariat have this
   responsibility), Brian Carpenter, Jim Galvin, Joel Halpern, Danny
   McPherson.
