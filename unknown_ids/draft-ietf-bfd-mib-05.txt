1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   [RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58, [RFC2580].


3.  Introduction

   This memo defines an portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects to configure and/or
   monitor Bi-Directional Forwarding Detection for [BFD] and [BFD-MH],
   BFD versions 0 and/or 1, on devices supporting this feature.

   -- Ed Note: TBA, support for [BFD-LSP].

   Comments should be made directly to the BFD mailing list at
   rtg-bfd@ietf.org.


4.  Terminology

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
   described in [BFD], [BFD-MH] and [BFD-LSP].  Unless otherwise stated,
   the mechanisms described therein will not be re-described here.


5.  Brief Description of MIB Objects

   This section describes objects pertaining to BFD.  The MIB objects
   are derived from [BFD] and [BFD-MH].

Internet-Draft       BFD Management Information Base         August 2008


5.1.  General Variables

   The General Variables are used to identify parameters that are global
   to the BFD process.

5.2.  Session Table (bfdSessionTable)

   The session table is used to identify a BFD session between a pair of
   nodes.

5.3.  Session Performance Table (bfdSessionPerfTable)

   The session performance table is used for collecting BFD performance
   counts on a per session basis.  This table is an AUGMENT to the
   bfdSessionTable.

5.4.  BFD Session Discriminator Mapping Table (bfdSessDiscMapTable)

   The BFD Session Discriminator Mapping Table maps a local
   discriminator value to associated BFD sessions' BfdSessIndexTC used
   in the bfdSessionTable.

5.5.  BFD Session IP Mapping Table (bfdSessIpMapTable)

   The BFD Session IP Mapping Table maps, given bfdSessInterface,
   bfdSessAddrType, and bfdSessAddr, to an associated BFD sessions'
   BfdSessIndexTC used in the bfdSessionTable.  This table SHOULD
   contains those BFD sessions are of IP type.


6.  BFD MIB Module Definitions

   This MIB module makes references to the following documents.
   [RFC2579], [RFC2580], [RFC2863], [RFC4001], and [RFC3413].

7.  Security Considerations

   As BFD may be tied into the stability of the network infrastructure
   (such as routing protocols), the effects of an attack on a BFD
   session may be very serious.  This ultimately has denial-of-service



Nadeau, et al.          Expires February 5, 2009               [Page 26]

Internet-Draft       BFD Management Information Base         August 2008


   effects, as links may be declared to be down (or falsely declared to
   be up.)  As such, improper manipulation of the objects represented by
   this MIB may result in denial of service to a large number of end-
   users.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  bfdSessAdminStatus - Improper change of bfdSessAdminStatus, from
      start to stop, can cause significant disruption of the
      connectivity to those portions of the Internet reached via the
      applicable remote BFD peer.

   o  bfdSessDesiredMinTxInterval, bfdSessReqMinRxInterval,
      bfdSessReqMinEchoRxInterval, bfdSessDetectMult - Improper change
      of this object can cause connections to be disrupted for extremely
      long time periods when otherwise they would be restored in a
      relatively short period of time.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of
   these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   o  The bfdSessTable may be used to directly configure BFD sessions.
      The bfdSessMapTable can be used indirectly in the same way.
      Unauthorized access to objects in this table could result in
      disruption of traffic on the network.  This is especially true if
      an unauthorized user configures enough tables to invoke a denial
      of service attack on the device where they are configured, or on a
      remote device where the sessions terminate.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:





Nadeau, et al.          Expires February 5, 2009               [Page 27]

   o  The bfdSessPerfTable both allows access to the performance
      characteristics of BFD sessions.  Network administrators not
      wishing to show this information should consider this table
      sensitive.

   The bfdSessAuthenticationType, bfdSessAuthenticationKeyID, and
   bfdSessAuthenticationKey objects hold security methods and associated
   security keys of BFD sessions.  These objects SHOULD be considered
   highly sensitive objects.  In order for these sensitive information
   from being improperly accessed, implementors MAY wish to allow only
   write-only access to these objects.  Even in such case, SET
   operations SHOULD be performed with security features.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec",
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the objects
   in these MIB modules.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8",
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for
   authentication and privacy".

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals "users" that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them.


8.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
           ----------        -----------------------

           bfdMib            { mib-2 XXX }

   [Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove

   this note.]

   This document also requests IANA to manage the registry for the
   BfdDiag object.
