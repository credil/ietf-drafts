1. Terminology 

   For description of the terminology used in this specification, please 
   see [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology]. 

    

2. Introduction 

   Commercial buildings have been fitted with pneumatic and subsequently 
   electronic communication pathways connecting sensors to their 
   controllers for over one hundred years.  Recent economic and 
   technical advances in wireless communication allow facilities to 
   increasingly utilize a wireless solution in lieu of a wired solution; 
   thereby reducing installation costs while maintaining highly reliant 
   communication.   

   The cost benefits and ease of installation of wireless sensors allow 
   customers to further instrument their facilities with additional 
   sensors; providing tighter control while yielding increased energy 
   savings.   

   Wireless solutions will be adapted from their existing wired 
   counterparts in many of the building applications including, but not 
   limited to Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), 
   Lighting, Physical Security, Fire, and Elevator systems. These 
   devices will be developed to reduce installation costs; while 
   increasing installation and retrofit flexibility, as well as 
   increasing the sensing fidelity to improve efficiency and building 
   service quality.

   Sensing devices may be battery or mains powered.  Actuators and area 
   controllers will be mains powered.  Still it is envisioned to see a 
   mix of wired and wireless sensors and actuators within buildings. 

   Facility Management Systems (FMS) are deployed in a large set of 
   vertical markets including universities; hospitals; government 
   facilities; Kindergarten through High School (K-12); pharmaceutical 
   manufacturing facilities; and single-tenant or multi-tenant office 
   buildings. These buildings range in size from 100K sqft structures (5 
   story office buildings), to 1M sqft skyscrapers (100 story 
   skyscrapers) to complex government facilities such as the Pentagon.  
   The described topology is meant to be the model to be used in all 
   these types of environments, but clearly must be tailored to the 
   building class, building tenant and vertical market being served.   

   The following sections describe the sensor, actuator, area controller 
   and zone controller layers of the topology.  (NOTE: The Building 
   Controller and Enterprise layers of the FMS are excluded from this 
   discussion since they typically deal in communication rates requiring 
   LAN/WLAN communication technologies).   

   Section 3 describes FMS architectures commonly installed in 
   commercial buildings.  Section 4 describes installation methods 
   deployed for new and remodeled construction.  Appendix B describes 
   various FMS use-cases and the interaction with humans for energy 
   conservation and life-safety applications.   

   Sections 3, 4, and Appendix B are mainly included for educational 
   purposes.  The aim of this document is to provide the set of IPv6 
   routing requirements for LLNs in buildings as described in Section 5. 

    

3. Facility Management System (FMS) Topology 

3.1. Introduction 

   To understand the network systems requirements of a facility 
   management system in a commercial building, this document uses a 
   framework to describe the basic functions and composition of the 
   system. An FMS is a hierarchical system of sensors, actuators, 
   controllers and user interface devices based on spatial extent.  
   Additionally, an FMS may also be divided functionally across alike, 
   but different building subsystems such as HVAC, Fire, Security, 
   Lighting, Shutters and Elevator control systems as denoted in Figure 
   1.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs    February 2009 
    

   Much of the makeup of an FMS is optional and installed at the behest 
   of the customer.  Sensors and actuators have no standalone 
   functionality. All other devices support partial or complete 
   standalone functionality.  These devices can optionally be tethered 
   to form a more cohesive system.  The customer requirements dictate 
   the level of integration within the facility.  This architecture 
   provides excellent fault tolerance since each node is designed to 
   operate in an independent mode if the higher layers are unavailable.

3.2. Sensors/Actuators 

   As Figure 1 indicates an FMS may be composed of many functional 
   stacks or silos that are interoperably woven together via Building 
   Applications.  Each silo has an array of sensors that monitor the 
   environment and actuators that effect the environment as determined 
 
 
Martocci,(et al)        Expires August 2, 2009                 [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs    February 2009 
    

   by the upper layers of the FMS topology.   The sensors typically are 
   the fringe of the network structure providing environmental data into 
   the system.  The actuators are the sensors counterparts modifying the 
   characteristics of the system based on the input sensor data and the 
   applications deployed.   

3.3. Area Controllers 

   An area describes a small physical locale within a building, 
   typically a room.  HVAC (temperature and humidity) and Lighting (room 
   lighting, shades, solar loads) vendors oft times deploy area 
   controllers. Area controls are fed by sensor inputs that monitor the 
   environmental conditions within the room.  Common sensors found in 
   many rooms that feed the area controllers include temperature, 
   occupancy, lighting load, solar load and relative humidity.  Sensors 
   found in specialized rooms (such as chemistry labs) might include air 
   flow, pressure, CO2 and CO particle sensors.  Room actuation includes 
   temperature setpoint, lights and blinds/curtains. 

3.4. Zone Controllers 

   Zone Control supports a similar set of characteristics as the Area 
   Control albeit to an extended space.  A zone is normally a logical 
   grouping or functional division of a commercial building.  A zone may 
   also coincidentally map to a physical locale such as a floor. 

   Zone Control may have direct sensor inputs (smoke detectors for 
   fire), controller inputs (room controllers for air-handlers in HVAC) 
   or both (door controllers and tamper sensors for security).  Like 
   area/room controllers, zone controllers are standalone devices that 
   operate independently or may be attached to the larger network for 
   more synergistic control. 

    

4. Installation Methods 

4.1. Wired Communication Media 

   Commercial controllers are traditionally deployed in a facility using 
   twisted pair serial media following the EIA-485 electrical standard 
   operating nominally at 38400 to 76800 baud.  This allows runs to 5000 
   ft without a repeater.  With the maximum of three repeaters, a single 
   communication trunk can serpentine 15000 ft.  EIA-485 is a multi-drop 
   media allowing upwards to 255 devices to be connected to a single 
   trunk.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs    February 2009 
    

    Most sensors and virtually all actuators currently used in 
   commercial buildings are "dumb", non-communicating hardwired devices.  
   However, sensor buses are beginning to be deployed by vendors which 
   are used for smart sensors and point multiplexing.   The Fire 
   industry deploys addressable fire devices, which usually use some 
   form of proprietary communication wiring driven by fire codes.  

4.2. Device Density 

   Device density differs depending on the application and as dictated 
   by the local building code requirements.  The following sections 
   detail typical installation densities for different applications. 

 4.2.1. HVAC Device Density 

   HVAC room applications typically have sensors/actuators and 
   controllers spaced about 50ft apart.  In most cases there is a 3:1 
   ratio of sensors/actuators to controllers.  That is, for each room 
   there is an installed temperature sensor, flow sensor and damper 
   actuator for the associated room controller.  

   HVAC equipment room applications are quite different.  An air handler 
   system may have a single controller with upwards to 25 sensors and 
   actuators within 50 ft of the air handler.  A chiller or boiler is 
   also controlled with a single equipment controller instrumented with 
   25 sensors and actuators.  Each of these devices would be 
   individually addressed since the devices are mandated or optional as 
   defined by the specified HVAC application.  Air handlers typically 
   serve one or two floors of the building.  Chillers and boilers may be 
   installed per floor, but many times service a wing, building or the 
   entire complex via a central plant. 

   These numbers are typical.  In special cases, such as clean rooms, 
   operating rooms, pharmaceuticals and labs, the ratio of sensors to 
   controllers can increase by a factor of three.  Tenant installations 
   such as malls would opt for packaged units where much of the sensing 
   and actuation is integrated into the unit.  Here a single device 
   address would serve the entire unit. 

 4.2.2. Fire Device Density 

   Fire systems are much more uniformly installed with smoke detectors 
   installed about every 50 feet.  This is dictated by local building 
   codes.  Fire pull boxes are installed uniformly about every 150 feet.  
   A fire controller will service a floor or wing.  The fireman's fire 
   panel will service the entire building and typically is installed in 
   the atrium.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs    February 2009 
    

 4.2.3. Lighting Device Density 

   Lighting is also very uniformly installed with ballasts installed 
   approximately every 10 feet.  A lighting panel typically serves 48 to 
   64 zones.  Wired systems typically tether many lights together into a 
   single zone.  Wireless systems configure each fixture independently 
   to increase flexibility and reduce installation costs. 

 4.2.4. Physical Security Device Density 

   Security systems are non-uniformly oriented with heavy density near 
   doors and windows and lighter density in the building interior space.  
   The recent influx of interior and perimeter camera systems is 
   increasing the security footprint.  These cameras are atypical 
   endpoints requiring upwards to 1 megabit/second (Mbit/s) data rates 
   per camera as contrasted by the few Kbits/s needed by most other FMS 
   sensing equipment.  Previously, camera systems had been deployed on 
   proprietary wired high speed network. More recent implementations 
   utilize wired or wireless IP cameras integrated to the enterprise 
   LAN.   

4.3. Installation Procedure 

   Wired FMS installation is a multifaceted procedure depending on the 
   extent of the system and the software interoperability requirement.  
   However, at the sensor/actuator and controller level, the procedure 
   is typically a two or three step process. 

   Most FMS equipment will utilize 24 VAC power sources that can be 
   installed by a low-voltage electrician.  He/she arrives on-site 
   during the construction of the building prior to the sheet wall and 
   ceiling installation.  This allows him/her to allocate wall space, 
   easily land the equipment and run the wired controller and sensor 
   networks.  The Building Controllers and Enterprise network are not 
   normally installed until months later.  The electrician completes his 
   task by running a wire verification procedure that shows proper 
   continuity between the devices and proper local operation of the 
   devices.   

   Later in the installation cycle, the higher order controllers are 
   installed, programmed and commissioned together with the previously 
   installed sensors, actuators and controllers.  In most cases the IP 
   network is still not operable.  The Building Controllers are 
   completely commissioned using a crossover cable or a temporary IP 
   switch together with static IP addresses.

   Once the IP network is operational, the FMS may optionally be added 
   to the enterprise network.  The wireless installation process must 
   follow the same work flow.  The electrician will install the products 
   as before and run local functional tests between the wireless device 
   to assure operation before leaving the job.   The electrician does 
   not carry a laptop so the commissioning must be built into the device 
   operation.

5. Building Automation Routing Requirements  

   Following are the building automation routing requirements for a 
   network used to integrate building sensor actuator and control 
   products.  These requirements have been limited to routing 
   requirements only.  These requirements are written not presuming any 
   preordained network topology, physical media (wired) or radio 
   technology (wireless).  See Appendix A for additional requirements 
   that have been deemed outside the scope of this document yet will 
   pertain to the successful deployment of building automation systems. 

5.1. Installation 

   Building control systems typically are installed and tested by 
   electricians having little computer knowledge and no network 
   knowledge whatsoever.  These systems are often installed during the 
   building construction phase before the drywall and ceilings are in 
   place.  For new construction projects, the building enterprise IP 
   network is not in place during installation of the building control 
   system. 

   In retrofit applications, pulling wires from sensors to controllers 
   can be costly and in some applications (e.g. museums) not feasible. 

   Local (ad hoc) testing of sensors and room controllers must be 
   completed before the tradesperson can complete his/her work.  This 
   testing allows the tradesperson to verify correct client (e.g. light 
   switch) and server (e.g. light ballast) before leaving the jobsite.   
   In traditional wired systems correct operation of a light 
   switch/ballast pair was as simple as flipping on the light switch.  
   In wireless applications, the tradesperson has to assure the same

   operation, yet be sure the operation of the light switch is 
   associated to the proper ballast.  

   System level commissioning will later be deployed using a more 
   computer savvy person with access to a commissioning device (e.g. a 
   laptop   computer).  The completely installed and commissioned 
   enterprise IP network may or may not be in place at this time.  
   Following are the installation routing requirements. 

 5.1.1. Zero-Configuration Installation 

   It MUST be possible to fully commission network devices without 
   requiring any additional commissioning device (e.g. laptop).  

 5.1.2. Sleeping Devices 

   Sensing devices will, in some cases, utilize battery power or energy 
   harvesting techniques for power and will operate mostly in a sleep 
   mode to maintain power consumption within a modest budget.  The 
   routing protocol MUST take into account device characteristics such 
   as power budget.  If such devices provide routing, rather than merely 
   host connectivity, the energy costs associated with such routing 
   needs to fit within the power budget.  If the mechanisms for duty 
   cycling dictate very long response times or specific temporal 
   scheduling, routing will need to take such constraints into account. 

   Typically, batteries need to be operational for at least 5 years when 
   the sensing device is transmitting its data(e.g. 64 bytes) once per 
   minute.  This requires that sleeping devices must have minimal link 
   on time when they awake and transmit onto the network. Moreover, 
   maintaining the ability to receive inbound data must be accomplished 
   with minimal link on time. 

   In many cases, proxies with unconstrained power budgets are used to 
   cache the inbound data for a sleeping device until the device 
   awakens.  In such cases, the routing protocol MUST discover the 
   capability of a node to act as a proxy during path calculation; 
   deliver the packet to the assigned proxy for later delivery to the 
   sleeping device upon its next awake cycle. 

 5.1.3. Local Testing 

   The local sensors and requisite actuators and controllers must be 
   testable within the locale (e.g. room) to assure communication 
   connectivity and local operation without requiring other systemic 
   devices.  Routing should allow for temporary ad hoc paths to be

   established that are updated as the network physically and 
   functionally expands. 

 5.1.4. Device Replacement 

   Replacement devices need to be plug-and-play with no additional setup 
   compared to what is normally required for a new device.  Devices 
   referencing data in the replaced device must be able to reference 
   data in its replacement without being reconfigured to refer to the 
   new device.  Thus, such a reference cannot be a hardware identifier, 
   such as the MAC address, nor a hard-coded route.  If such a reference 
   is an IP address, the replacement device must be assigned the IP 
   addressed previously bound to the replaced device.  Or if the logical 
   equivalent of a hostname is used for the reference, it must be 
   translated to the replacement IP address. 

 

5.2. Scalability 

   Building control systems are designed for facilities from 50000 sq. 
   ft. to 1M+ sq. ft.  The networks that support these systems must 
   cost-effectively scale accordingly.  In larger facilities 
   installation may occur simultaneously on various wings or floors, yet 
   the end system must seamlessly merge.  Following are the scalability 
   requirements. 

 5.2.1. Network Domain 

   The routing protocol MUST be able to support networks with at least 
   2000 nodes supporting at least 1000 routing devices and 1000 non-
   routing device.  Subnetworks (e.g. rooms, primary equipment) within 
   the network must support upwards to 255 sensors and/or actuators. 

    

 5.2.2. Peer-to-Peer Communication 

   The data domain for commercial FMS systems may sprawl across a vast 
   portion of the physical domain.  For example, a chiller may reside in 
   the facility's basement due to its size, yet the associated cooling 
   towers will reside on the roof.  The cold-water supply and return 
   pipes serpentine through all the intervening floors.  The feedback 
   control loops for these systems require data from across the 
   facility. 


 
 
Martocci,(et al)        Expires August 2, 2009                [Page 12] 

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs    February 2009 
    

   A network device must be able to communicate in a peer-to-peer manner 
   with any other device on the network. Thus, the routing protocol MUST 
   provide routes between arbitrary hosts within the appropriate 
   administrative domain.  

    

5.3. Mobility 

   Most devices are affixed to walls or installed on ceilings within 
   buildings.  Hence the mobility requirements for commercial buildings 
   are few.  However, in wireless environments location tracking of 
   occupants and assets is gaining favor.  Asset tracking applications 
   require monitoring movement with granularity of a minute.  This soft 
   real-time performance requirement is reflected in the performance 
   requirements below. 

 5.3.1. Mobile Device Requirements 

   To minimize network dynamics, mobile devices SHOULD not be allowed to 
   act as forwarding devices (routers) for other devices in the LLN. 

   A mobile device that moves within an LLN SHOULD reestablish end-to-
   end communication to a fixed device also in the LLN within 2 seconds.   
   The network convergence time should be less than 5 seconds once the 
   mobile device stops moving. 

   A mobile device that moves outside of an LLN SHOULD reestablish end-
   to-end communication to a fixed device in the new LLN within 5 
   seconds.  The network convergence time should be less than 5 seconds 
   once the mobile device stops moving. 

   A mobile device that moves outside of one LLN into another LLN SHOULD 
   reestablish end-to-end communication to a fixed device in the old LLN 
   within 10 seconds.  The network convergence time should be less than 
   10 seconds once the mobile device stops. 

   A mobile device that moves outside of one LLN into another LLN SHOULD 
   reestablish end-to-end communication to another mobile device in the 
   new LLN within 20 seconds.  The network convergence time should be 
   less than 30 seconds once the mobile devices stop moving. 

   A mobile device that moves outside of one LLN into another LLN SHOULD 
   reestablish end-to-end communication to a mobile device in the old 
   LLN within 30 seconds.  The network convergence time should be less 
   than 30 seconds once the mobile devices stop moving.

5.4. Resource Constrained Devices 

   Sensing and actuator device processing power and memory may be 4 
   orders of magnitude less (i.e. 10,000x) than many more traditional 
   client devices on an IP network.  The routing mechanisms must 
   therefore be tailored to fit these resource constrained devices.  

 5.4.1. Limited Processing Power for Non-routing Devices. 

   The software size requirement for non-routing devices (e.g. sleeping 
   sensors and actuators) SHOULD be implementable in 8-bit devices with 
   no more than 128KB of memory.  

 5.4.2. Limited Processing Power for Routing Devices 

   The software size requirements for routing devices (e.g. room 
   controllers) SHOULD be implementable in 8-bit devices with no more 
   than 256KB of flash memory. 

5.5. Addressing 

   Facility Management systems require different communication schemes 
   to solicit or post network information. Broadcasts or anycasts need 
   be used to resolve unresolved references within a device when the 
   device first joins the network.   

   As with any network communication, broadcasting should be minimized.  
   This is especially a problem for small embedded devices with limited 
   network bandwidth.  In many cases a global broadcast could be 
   replaced with a multicast since the application knows the application 
   domain.  Broadcasts and multicasts are typically used for network 
   joins and application binding in embedded systems. 

 5.5.1. Unicast/Multicast/Anycast 

   Routing MUST support anycast, unicast, and multicast. 

    

    

5.6. Manageability 

   In addition to the initial installation of the system (see Section 
   4.1), it is equally important for the ongoing maintenance of the 
   system to be simple and inexpensive.

 5.6.1. Firmware Upgrades 

   To support high speed code downloads, routing MUST support transports 
   that provide parallel downloads to targeted devices yet guarantee 
   packet delivery.  In cases where the spatial position of the devices 
   requires multiple hops, the algorithm must recurse through the 
   network until all targeted devices have been serviced. 

 5.6.2. Diagnostics 

   To improve diagnostics, the network layer SHOULD be able to be placed 
   in and out of 'verbose' mode.  Verbose mode is a temporary debugging 
   mode that provides additional communication information including at 
   least total number of routing packets sent and received, number of 
   routing failure (no route available), neighbor table, and routing 
   table entries.  

 5.6.3. Route Tracking 

   Route diagnostics SHOULD be supported providing information such as 
   path quality; number of hops; available alternate active paths with 
   associated costs.  Path quality is the relative measure of 'goodness' 
   of the selected source to destination path as compared to alternate 
   paths.  This composite value may be measured as a function of hop 
   count, signal strength, available power, existing active paths or any 
   other criteria deemed by ROLL as the path cost differentiator. 

    

5.7. Route Selection 

   Route selection determines reliability and quality of the 
   communication paths among the devices. Optimizing the routes over 
   time resolve any nuances developed at system startup when nodes are 
   asynchronously adding themselves to the network.  Path adaptation 
   will reduce latency if the path costs consider hop count as a cost 
   attribute. 

 5.7.1. Path Cost 

   The routing protocol MUST support a metric of route quality and 
   optimize path selection according to such metrics within constraints 
   established for links along the paths. These metrics SHOULD reflect 
   metrics such as signal strength, available bandwidth, hop count, 
   energy availability and communication error rates.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs    February 2009 
    

 5.7.2. Path Adaptation 

   Communication paths MUST adapt toward the chosen metric(s) (e.g. 
   signal quality) optimality in time. 

 5.7.3. Route Redundancy 

   The network layer SHOULD be configurable to allow secondary and 
   tertiary paths to be established and used upon failure of the primary 
   path.   

 5.7.4. Route Discovery Time 

   Mission critical commercial applications (e.g. Fire, Security) 
   require reliable communication and guaranteed end-to-end delivery of 
   all messages in a timely fashion.  Application layer time-outs must 
   be selected judiciously to cover anomalous conditions such as lost 
   packets and/or path discoveries; yet not be set too large to over 
   damp the network response.  If route discovery occurs during packet 
   transmission time, it SHOULD NOT add more than 120ms of latency to 
   the packet delivery time. 

 5.7.5. Route Preference 

   Route cost algorithms SHOULD allow the installer to optionally select 
   'preferred' paths based on the known spatial layout of the 
   communicating devices. 

6. Traffic Pattern 

   The independent nature of the automation systems within a building 
   plays heavy onto the network traffic patterns.  Much of the real-time 
   sensor data stays within the local environment.  Alarming and other 
   event data will percolate to higher layers.   

   Systemic data may be either polled or event based.  Polled data 
   systems will generate a uniform packet load on the network.  This 
   architecture has proven not scalable.  Most vendors have developed 
   event based systems which pass data on event.  These systems are 
   highly scalable and generate low data on the network at quiescence.  
   Unfortunately, the systems will generate a heavy load on startup 
   since all the initial data must migrate to the controller level.  
   They also will generate a temporary but heavy load during firmware 
   upgrades.  This latter load can normally be mitigated by performing 
   these downloads during off-peak hours.

   Devices will need to reference peers occasionally for sensor data or 
   to coordinate across systems.  Normally, though, data will migrate 
   from the sensor level upwards through the local, area then 
   supervisory level.  Bottlenecks will typically form at the funnel 
   point from the area controllers to the supervisory controllers. 

   Initial system startup after a controlled outage or unexpected power 
   failure puts tremendous stress on the network and on the routing 
   algorithms.  An FMS system is comprised of a myriad of control 
   algorithms at the room, area, zone, and enterprise layers.  When 
   these control algorithms are at quiescence, the real-time data 
   changes are small and the network will not saturate.  However, upon 
   any power loss, the control loops and real-time data quickly atrophy.  
   A ten minute outage may take many hours to regain control. 

   Upon restart all lines-powered devices power-on instantaneously.  
   However due to application startup and self tests, these devices will 
   attempt to join the network randomly.  Empirical testing indicates 
   that routing paths acquired during startup will tend to be very 
   oblique since the available neighbor lists are incomplete.  This 
   demands an adaptive routing protocol to allow for path optimization 
   as the network stabilizes. 

 

7. Security Considerations 

   Security policies, especially wireless encryption and device 
   authentication needs to be considered, especially with concern to the 
   impact on the processing capabilities and additional latency incurred 
   on the sensors, actuators and controllers. 

   FMS systems are typically highly configurable in the field and hence 
   the security policy is most often dictated by the type of building to 
   which the FMS is being installed.   Single tenant owner occupied 
   office buildings installing lighting or HVAC control are candidates 
   for implementing low or even no security on the LLN.  Antithetically, 
   military or pharmaceutical facilities require strong security 
   policies.  As noted in the installation procedures above, security 
   policies must be facile to allow no security during the installation 
   phase (prior to building occupancy), yet easily raise the security 
   level network wide during the commissioning phase of the system.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs    February 2009 
    

7.1. Security Requirements 

 7.1.1. Authentication 

   Authentication SHOULD be optional on the LLN.  Authentication SHOULD 
   be fully configurable on-site. Authentication policy and updates MUST 
   be transmittable over-the-air.  Authentication SHOULD occur upon 
   joining or rejoining a network.  However, once authenticated devices 
   SHOULD not need to reauthenticate themselves with any other devices 
   in the LLN.  Packets may need authentication at the source and 
   destination nodes, however, packets routed through intermediate hops 
   should not need to be reauthenticated at each hop. 

    

 7.1.2. Encryption 

7.1.2.1. Encryption Levels 

   Encryption SHOULD be optional on the LLN.  Encryption SHOULD be fully 
   configurable on-site.  Encryption policy and updates SHOULD be 
   transmittable over-the-air and in-the-clear.   

7.1.2.2. Security Policy Flexibility 

   In most facilities authentication and encryption will be turned off 
   during installation.   

   More complex encryption policies might be put in force at 
   commissioning time.  New encryption policies MUST be allowed to be 
   presented to all devices in the LLN over the network without needing 
   to visit each device. 

7.1.2.3. Encryption Types 

   Data encryption of packets MUST optionally be supported by use of 
   either a network wide key and/or application key.  The network key 
   would apply to all devices in the LLN.  The application key would 
   apply to a subset of devices on the LLN.   

   The network key and application keys would be mutually exclusive.  
   Forwarding devices in the mesh MUST be able to forward a packet 
   encrypted with an application key without needing to have the 
   application key.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs    February 2009 
    

7.1.2.4. Packet Encryption  

   The encryption policy MUST support encryption of the payload only or 
   the entire packet.  Payload only encryption would eliminate the 
   decryption/re-encryption overhead at every hop. 

    

 7.1.3. Disparate Security Policies 

   Due to the limited resources of an LLN, the security policy defined 
   within the LLN MUST be able to differ from that of the rest of the IP 
   network within the facility yet packets MUST still be able to route 
   to or through the LLN from/to these networks.

   were deemed out of scope for the routing document yet provided 
   ancillary informational substance to the reader.  The requirements 
   should be addressed by ROLL or other WGs before adoption by the 
   building automation industry. 

11.1. Additional Commercial Product Requirements 

11.1.1.  Wired and Wireless Implementations

11.1.3.  Support of the BACnet Building Protocol 

   Devices implementing the ROLL features should support the BACnet 
   protocol. 

11.1.4.  Support of the LON Building Protocol 

   Devices implementing the ROLL features should support the LON 
   protocol. 

11.1.5.  Energy Harvested Sensors 

   RFDs should target for operation using viable energy harvesting 
   techniques such as ambient light, mechanical action, solar load, air 
   pressure and differential temperature. 

11.1.6.  Communication Distance 

   A source device may be upwards to 1000 feet from its destination.  
   Communication may need to be established between these devices 
   without needing to install other intermediate 'communication only' 
   devices such as repeaters 

11.1.7.  Automatic Gain Control 

   For wireless implementations, the device radios should incorporate 
   automatic transmit power regulation to maximize packet transfer and 
   minimize network interference regardless of network size or density. 

 11.1.8.   Cost 

   The total installed infrastructure cost including but not limited to 
   the media, required infrastructure devices (amortized across the 
   number of devices); labor to install and commission the network must 
   not exceed $1.00/foot for wired implementations.   

   Wireless implementations (total installed cost) must cost no more 
   than 80% of wired implementations. 

 11.1.9. IPv4 Compatibility 

   The routing protocol must support cost-effective intercommunication 
   among IPv4 and IPv6 devices.

11.2.    Additional Installation and Commissioning Requirements  

 11.2.1.   Device Setup Time 

   Network setup by the installer must take no longer than 20 seconds 
   per device installed. 

11.2.2.  Unavailability of an IT network 

   Product commissioning must be performed by an application engineer 
   prior to the installation of the IT network.   

11.3.    Additional Network Requirements  

 11.3.1.   TCP/UDP 

   Connection based and connectionless services must be supported 

 11.3.2.   Data Rate Performance 

   An effective data rate of 20kbits/s is the lowest acceptable 
   operational data rate acceptable on the network. 

 11.3.3.   High Speed Downloads 

   Devices receiving a download MAY cease normal operation, but upon 
   completion of the download must automatically resume normal 
   operation. 

11.3.4.  Interference Mitigation 

   The network must automatically detect interference and seamlessly 
   migrate the network hosts channel to improve communication.  Channel 
   changes and nodes response to the channel change must occur within 60 
   seconds. 

11.3.5.  Real-time Performance Measures 

   A node transmitting a 'request with expected reply' to another node 
   must send the message to the destination and receive the response in 
   not more than 120 msec.  This response time should be achievable with 
   5 or less hops in each direction.  This requirement assumes network 
   quiescence and a negligible turnaround time at the destination node. 

 11.3.6.   Packet Reliability 

   Reliability must meet the following minimum criteria :

   < 1% MAC layer errors on all messages; After no more than three 
   retries   

   < .1% Network layer errors on all messages; 

   After no more than three additional retries; 

   < 0.01% Application layer errors on all messages. 

   Therefore application layer messages will fail no more than once 
   every 100,000 messages. 

 11.3.7.   Merging Commissioned Islands 

   Subsystems are commissioned by various vendors at various times 
   during building construction.  These subnetworks must seamlessly 
   merge into networks and networks must seamlessly merge into 
   internetworks since the end user wants a holistic view of the system. 

 11.3.8.   Adjustable System Table Sizes 

   Routing must support adjustable router table entry sizes on a per 
   node basis to maximize limited RAM in the devices. 

 

11.4. Prioritized Routing 

   Network and application routing prioritization is required to assure 
   that mission critical applications (e.g. Fire Detection) cannot be 
   deferred while less critical application access the network. 

11.4.1. Packet Prioritization 

   Routers must support quality of service prioritization to assure 
   timely response for critical FMS packets. 

11.5. Constrained Devices 

   The network may be composed of a heterogeneous mix of full, battery 
   and energy harvested devices.  The routing protocol must support 
   these constrained devices.

11.5.1. Proxying for Constrained Devices 

   Routing must support in-bound packet caches for low-power (battery 
   and energy harvested) devices when these devices are not accessible 
   on the network.   

   These devices must have a designated powered proxying device to which 
   packets will be temporarily routed and cached until the constrained 
   device accesses the network. 

    

11.6. Reliability 

 11.6.1. Device Integrity 

   Commercial Building devices must all be periodically scanned to 
   assure that the device is viable and can communicate data and alarm 
   information as needed. Network routers should maintain previous 
   packet flow information temporally to minimize overall network 
   overhead. 

    

11.7. Path Persistence 

   To eliminate high network traffic in power-fail or brown-out 
   conditions previously established routes SHOULD be remembered and 
   invoked prior to establishing new routes for those devices reentering 
   the network. 

    

    

12. Appendix B: FMS Use-Cases 

   Appendix B contains FMS use-cases that describes the use of sensors 
   and controllers for various applications with a commercial building 
   and how they interplay with energy conservation and life-safety 
   applications. 

   The Vooruit arts centre is a restored monument which dates from 1913.  
   This complex monument consists of over 350 different rooms including 
   a meeting rooms, large public halls and theaters serving as many as 
   2500 guests.  A number of use cases regarding Vooruit are described 
   in the following text.  The situations and needs described in these

   use cases can also be found in all automated large buildings, such as 
   airports and hospitals. 

12.1. Locking and Unlocking the Building 

   The member of the cleaning staff arrives first in the morning 
   unlocking the building (or a part of it) from the control room.  This 
   means that several doors are unlocked; the alarms are switched off; 
   the heating turns on; some lights switch on, etc.  Similarly, the 
   last person leaving the building has to lock the building.  This will 
   lock all the outer doors, turn the alarms on, switch off heating and 
   lights, etc. 

   The "building locked" or "building unlocked" event needs to be 
   delivered to a subset of all the sensors and actuators. It can be 
   beneficial if those field devices form a group (e.g. "all-sensors-
   actuators-interested-in-lock/unlock-events). Alternatively, the area 
   and zone controllers could form a group where the arrival of such an 
   event results in each area and zone controller initiating unicast or 
   multicast within the LLN. 

   This use case is also described in the home automation, although the 
   requirement about preventing the "popcorn effect" I-D.ietf-roll-home-
   routing-reqs] can be relaxed a bit in building automation. It would 
   be nice if lights, roll-down shutters and other actuators in the same 
   room or area with transparent walls execute the command around (not 
   'at') the same time (a tolerance of 200 ms is allowed). 

12.2. Building Energy Conservation 

   A room that is not in use should not be heated, air conditioned or 
   ventilated and the lighting should be turned off or dimmed.  In a 
   building with many rooms it can happen quite frequently that someone 
   forgets to switch off the HVAC and lighting, thereby wasting valuable 
   energy.  To prevent this occurrence, the facility manager might 
   program the building according to the day's schedule.  This way 
   lighting and HVAC is turned on prior to the use of a room, and turned 
   off afterwards.  Using such a system Vooruit has realized a saving of 
   35% on the gas and electricity bills.   

12.3. Inventory and Remote Diagnosis of Safety Equipment 

   Each month Vooruit is obliged to make an inventory of its safety 
   equipment.  This task takes two working days.  Each fire extinguisher 
   (100), fire blanket (10), fire-resistant door (120) and evacuation 
   plan (80) must be checked for presence and proper operation.  Also 
   the battery and lamp of every safety lamp must be checked before each

   public event (safety laws).  Automating this process using asset 
   tracking and low-power wireless technologies would reduce a heavy 
   burden on working hours. 

   It is important that these messages are delivered very reliably and 
   that the power consumption of the sensors/actuators attached to this 
   safety equipment is kept at a very low level.  

    

12.4. Life Cycle of Field Devices 

   Some field devices (e.g. smoke detectors) are replaced periodically.   
   The ease by which devices are added and deleted from the network is 
   very important to support augmenting sensors/actuators during 
   construction. 

   A secure mechanism is needed to remove the old device and install the 
   new device.  New devices need to be authenticated before they can 
   participate in the routing process of the LLN. After the 
   authentication, zero-configuration of the routing protocol is 
   necessary. 

12.5. Surveillance 

   Ingress and egress are real-time applications needing response times 
   below 500msec, for example for cardkey authorization.  It must be 
   possible to configure doors individually to restrict use on a per 
   person basis with respect to time-of-day and person entering.  While 
   much of the surveillance application involves sensing and actuation 
   at the door and communication with the centralized security system, 
   other aspects, including tamper, door ajar, and forced entry 
   notification, are to be delivered to one or more fixed or mobile user 
   devices within 5 seconds. 

12.6. Emergency 

   In case of an emergency it is very important that all the visitors be 
   evacuated as quickly as possible.  The fire and smoke detectors set 
   off an alarm and alert the mobile personnel on their user device 
   (e.g. PDA).  All emergency exits are instantly unlocked and the 
   emergency lighting guides the visitors to these exits.  The necessary 
   sprinklers are activated and the electricity grid monitored if it 
   becomes necessary to shut down some parts of the building. Emergency 
   services are notified instantly.

   A wireless system could bring in some extra safety features.  
   Locating fire fighters and guiding them through the building could be 
   a life-saving application. 

   These life critical applications ought to take precedence over other 
   network traffic.  Commands entered during these emergencies have to 
   be properly authenticated by device, user, and command request. 

    

12.7. Public Address 

   It should be possible to send audio and text messages to the visitors 
   in the building.  These messages can be very diverse, e.g. ASCII text 
   boards displaying the name of the event in a room, audio 
   announcements such as delays in the program, lost and found children, 
   evacuation orders, etc. 

   The control network is expected be able to readily sense the presence 
   of an audience in an area and deliver applicable message content.
