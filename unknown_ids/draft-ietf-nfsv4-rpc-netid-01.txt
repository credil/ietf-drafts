Internet-Draft                 RPC Netids                    August 2008


1.  Introduction and Motivation

   The concept of an RPC ([3]) Network Identifier (netid) was introduced
   in [2] for distinguishing universal network addresses of multiple
   protocols. [2] states that a netid ``is defined by a system
   administrator based on local conventions, and cannot be depended on
   to have the same value on every system.''  Since the publication of
   RFC1833, it has been found to be necessary that protocols like [4]
   and [5] depend on consistent values of netids across every system,
   and current practices tend to ensure this consistency.  Thus, this
   document identifies the considerations for IANA to establish a
   registry of netids for RPC and specifies the initial content of the
   registry.


2.  Security Considerations

   See section 9 of [6].


3.  IANA Considerations

   This section uses terms that are defined in [6].

   IANA will create a registry called "ONC RPC Netids".  The remainder
   of this section describes the registry.

   All assignments to the ONC RPC Netids registry are made on one of two
   bases:

   o  First Come First Served basis per section 4.1 of [6].

   o  Standards Action per section 4.1 of [6].

   Netids can be up to 2^32 - 1 octets in length.  However, to ensure
   that practical values for Standards Track protocols are not
   exhausted, the values of netids one to eight octets long should be
   used for netids assigned on the Standards Action basis.  Assignments
   made on a First Come First Served basis should be assigned netids of
   length 9 to 128 octets long.  All netids, regardless of length, that
   start with the prefixes "STDS" or "FCFS" are Reserved, in order to
   extend the name space of either basis.  In addition, to give IESG the
   flexibility in the future to permit Private and Experimental Uses,
   all netids with the prefixes "PRIV" or "EXPE" are Reserved.  The zero
   length netid is Reserved.  Some exceptions are listed in Table 2.  A
   recommended convention for netids corresponding to transports that
   work over the IPv6 protocol is to have "6" as the last character in
   the netid string name.

   Since netids are not constructed in an explicit hierarchical manner,
   this document does not provide for Hierarchical Allocation of netids.
   Nonetheless, the octet "." in a netid string is Reserved for future
   possible provision of Hierarchical Allocation.

   The registry of netids is a list of assignments, each containing six
   fields for each assignment made on a First Come First Served basis,
   and five fields for each assignment made on a Standards Action basis.
   Regardless of basis, all six fields must be provided to IANA.

   1.  A US-ASCII string name that is the actual netid.  This name MUST
       NOT conflict with any other netid.  This string name can be zero
       to 128 octets long.

   2.  A constant name that can be used for software programs that wish
       to use the transport protocol associated with protocol.  The name
       of the constant typically has the prefix: 'NC_', and a suffix
       equal to the upper case version of the netid.  This constant name
       should be a constant that is valid in the 'C' programming
       language.  This constant name MUST NOT conflict with any other
       netid constant name.  Constant names starting with "NC_STDS",
       "NC_FCFS", "NC_PRIV", or "NC_EXPE" are reserved.  Constant names
       with a prefix of "NC_" and a total length of 11 characters or
       less should be for assignments made on the Standards Action
       basis.  The constant name can be 1 to 131 octets long.

   3.  For assignments made on a First Come First Served basis a
       description, which can be up to 1024 US-ASCII characters (or more
       if IANA permits) how the netid will be used.  For assignments
       made on a Standards Action basis, the description field is
       provided to the Designated Expert to enable the review, but the
       description is not recorded in the registry, and IANA may dispose
       of the description once IESG approves the assignment.

   4.  For assignments made on a First Come First Served basis, if
       applicable, a reference to a published description of the
       transport protocol (preferred), or a reference to a published use
       of the transport protocol.  This reference can consume up to 256
       octets (or more if IANA permits).  For assignments made on a
       Standards Action basis, the RFC number of the protocol the netid
       is associated with must be provided.

   5.  For assignments made on a First Come First Served basis, if
       applicable, a reference to a published description of the network
       protocol (preferred), or a reference to a published use of the
       transport protocol.  This reference can consume up to 256 octets
       (or more if IANA permits).  For assignments made on a Standards
       Action basis, if the previous field refers to a transport

       protocol, the RFC number of the network protocol the netid is
       associated with must be provided.

   6.  For assignments made on a First Come First Served basis, a point
       of contact, including an email address.  The point of contact can
       consume up to 256 octets (or more if IANA permits).  Subject to
       authorization by a Designated Expert, the point of contact may be
       omitted for extraordinary situations, such as the registration of
       a commonly used netid where the owner is in unknown.  For
       assignments made on a Standards Action basis the point of contact
       is always IESG.

3.1.  Initial Registry

   The initial list of netids is broken into those assigned on a First
   Come First Serve basis in Table 1 and those assigned on a Standards
   Action basis in Table 2.  These lists will change when IANA registers
   additional netids as needed, and the authoritative list of registered
   netids will always live with IANA.

3.2.  Updating Registrations

   Per section 5.2 of [6] the point of contact is always permitted to
   update a registration made on a First Come First Served basis
   "subject to the same constraints and review as with new
   registrations."  IESG or a Designated Expert is permitted to update
   any registration made on a First Come First Served basis, which
   normally is done when the PoC cannot be reached in order to make
   necessary updates.  Examples where an update would be needed
   included, but are not limited to: the email address or other contact
   information becomes invalid; the reference to the corresponding
   protocol becomes obsolete or unavailable; and RFC1833 [2] is updated
   or replaced in such a way that the scope of netids changes, requiring
   additional fields in the assignment.

   Only IESG, on the advice of a Designated Expert, can update a
   registration made on a Standards Action basis.
