1. Introduction

   The Framework for Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
   within the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) (the MPLS-TP OAM
   Framework, [OAM-FWK]) describes how Maintenance Intermediate Points
   (MIPs) may be situated within network nodes at the incoming and
   outgoing interfaces.

   OAM messages are formed and delivered using the expiration of the
   MPLS shim header time-to-live (TTL) field, and the presence of the
   Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) in the label stack under the
   top label [RFC5586]. This means that all OAM messages intended for
   any MIP on a node are delivered to the MIP at the incoming interface.

   This document describes a way of forming OAM messages so that they
   can be targeted at incoming MIPs and outgoing MIPs, forwarded
   correctly through the "switch fabric", and handled efficiently in
   optimized node implementations where there is no distinction between
   the incoming and outgoing MIP.

   The material in this document is provided for discussion within the
   MPLS-TP community in the expectation that this idea or some similar
   mechanism will be subsumed into a more general MPLS-TP OAM document.

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

   Note that the acronym "OAM" is used in conformance with [OAM-SOUP].

2. Summary of Problem Statement

   Figure 1 shows an abstract functional represenation of an MPLS-TP
   node. It is decomposed as an incoming interface, a cross-connect
   (XC), and an outgoing interface. As per the discussion in
   [OAM-FWK], MIPs may be placed in each of the functional interace
   components.

      Figure 1 : Abstract Functional Representation of an MPLS-TP Node

   Several distinct OAM functions are required within this architectural
   model:

   - OAM loopback at a MIP
   - data loopback at a MIP
   - OAM control at a MIP
   - measurement at a MIP

   The MIPs in these OAM functions may equally be the MIPs at the input
   or output interfaces.

   The way that OAM messages are delivered to an MPLS-TP node is through
   the expirey of the TTL in the top-of-stack shim header on the MPLS
   packet. The top label in the stack is always the same as would be
   used for data on the same label switched path (LSP) so that OAM is
   handled in exactly the same way as data as it travels through the
   network. The second label on the stack is the GAL so that OAM can be
   distinguished from data.

   Any solution for sending OAM to the in and out MIPs must fit within
   this existing model of handling OAM.

   Additionally, many MPLS-TP nodes contain an optimization such that
   all queuing and forwarding function is performed at the incoming
   interface. The abstract functional representation of such a node is
   shown in Figure 2. As shown in the figure, the outgoing interfaces
   are minimal and for this reason it may not be possible to include MIP
   function on those interfaces. This is particularly the case for
   existing deployed implmentations.

   Any solution that attempts to send OAM to the outgoing interface of
   an MPLS-TP node must not cause any problems when such implementations
   are present.

   Lastly, OAM must operate on MPLS-TP nodes that are branch points on
   point-to-multipoint (P2MP). That means that it must possible to
   target individual outgoing MIPs as well as all outgoing MIPs in the
   abstract fucntional representation shown in Figure 3, as well as to
   handle the optimized P2MP node as shown in Figure 4.

                        Optimized MPLS-TP Node Supporting P2MP


   In summary, the solution for OAM message delivery must support the
   following features:

   - Forwarding of OAM packets exactly as data packets.
   - Delivery of OAM messages to the correct MPLS-TP node.
   - Direction of OAM instructions to the correct MIP within an MPLS-TP
     node.
   - Packet inspection at the outgoing interface must be minimised.

   Note that although this issue appears superficially to be an
   implementation matter local to an individual node, the format of the
   message needs to be standardised so that:

   - An upstream MEP can correctly target the outgoing MIP of a specific
     MPLS-TP node.
   - A downstream node can correctly filter out any OAM messages that
     were intended for its upstream negihbor's outgoing MIP, but which
     were not handled there because the upstream neighbor is an
     optimized implmentation.

2.1. Rejected Partial Solution

   A reject solution is depicted in Figure 5. All data and non-local OAM
   is handled as normal. Local OAM is intercepted at the incoming
   interface and delivered to the MIP at the incoming interface. If the
   OAM is intended for the incoming MIP it is handled there with no

   issues. If the OAM is intended for the outgoing MIP it is forwarded
   to that MIP using some internal messaging system that is
   implementation-specific.

             Figure 5 : OAM Control Message Delivery Bypassing
                             the Switching Fabric

   This solution is fully functional for the incoming MIP. It also
   supports control of data loopback for the outgoing MIP, and can
   adequately perform some OAM features such as interface identity
   reporting at the outgoing MIP.

   However, because the the OAM message is not forwarded through the
   switch fabric, this solution cannot correctly perform OAM loopback,
   connectivity verification, LSP tracing, or performance measurement.

3. Proposed Solution

   Figure 6 shows a proposed message format for handling the different
   cases described in Section 2. The subsections that follow describe
   the processing rules for each case.

   Note that this proposed solution requires a packet to be sent with
   TTL=0. An alternative approach is described in Section 4.

3.1. Processing of Data and Non-Local OAM

   The message formats and processing rules for data and non-local OAM
   are not changed by this proposal.

   The top-of-stack label is swapped and the top-of-stack TTL is
   decremented.

3.2. Processing of In-MIP OAM

   The message formats and processing rules for in-MIP OAM are not
   changed by this proposal.

   The top-of-stack TTL is decremented and expires. The packet is
   examined further and the GAL is discovered. Further inspection of the
   packet reveals the ACH type and the packet is delivered to the
   in-MIP.

   Note that an ACH TLV could be included to identify the in-MIP (as in
   Section 3.3), but this is not required since the absence of such a
   TLV could be inferred to indicate the in-MIP as the target.

3.3. Processing of Out-MIP OAM

   OAM messages intended for the out-MIP on a node are initially
   intercepted as any OAM message targeted at any MIP on the node. That
   is, the TTL expires, the GAL is found, and the ACH indicates that the
   message is OAM.

   An ACH TLV is included to indicate that the OAM is targeted at the
   outgoing MIP.

   The incoming interface must forward the OAM message through the
   switch fabric as if it was data. So, the packet is passed on
   unchanged except that the TTL has been decremented and expired. This
   enables the outgoing interface to inspect only the TTL field of the
   outgoing packet to know that it should intercept the packet and not
   send it out to the next MPLS-TP node.

   Further inspection of the packet at the outgoing interface will
   reveal the GAL, the ACH type, and the ACH TLV.

3.4. Processing at P2MP Branch Nodes

   At P2MP branch nodes, the OAM messages may be targeted at one or all
   outgoing interfaces. It should be noted that packet replication is a
   function of the switch fabric so that any OAM message forwarded by
   the incoming interface will be passed to all outgoing interfaces.

   The procedures operate as described in section 3.3. The outgoing
   interfaces are able to determine whether the OAM message is intended
   for the local MIP by examining a MIP identifier carried in an ACH
   TLV.

   OAM messages received at outgoing interfaces but not intended for the
   local MIP are silently dropped.

3.5. Processing When There is No Out-MIP

   When there is no out-MIP supported on an optimized switch
   implementation there are two options.

   1. The OAM message is intercepted at the incoming interface as
      described in Section 3.3, but the incoming interface is aware that
      it forms part of an optimized implementation that does not support
      an out-MIP. It can discard the received OAM message, or respond to
      indicate that the out-MIP is not supported.

   2. The OAM message is intercepted and forwarded as described in
      Section 3.3. Since there is no out-MIP, the message is forwarded
      out of the outgoing interface to the next downstream MPLS-TP node
      as shown at the bottom of Figure 6. This means that the packet
      will be received at the downstream node carrying a TTL that has
      already expired (before it is decremented at the downstream node)
      indicating that the packet should be silently discarded.

      If the packet is examined, it will reveal a GAL, an ACH type
      indicating OAM, and an ACH TLV identifying a MIP that is not local
      to the downstream node. This will result in the packet being
      dropped or a negative response being sent.

4. Enhanced Proposed Solution

   The mechanisms described in Section 3 can be enhanced by the use of a
   new reserved label, the Outgoin Mip Lable (OML). This label is
   substituted for the GAL when an OAM message intended for an outgoing
   MIP is processed at an incoming interface as shown in Figure 7.

   The advantage of this mechanism is that the outgoing interface of the
   local node and the incoming interface of the downstream node have
   someting more substantial to check than just the TTL value being
   zero. In fact, it allows the mesage to be sent with TTL of one so
   that the rules for sending packets with zero TTL are not compromised.

   The disadvantage is that a further reserved label is used.

   Note that an option is to allocate the OML as a purely local matter.

   That means that the implementation allocates the value of the OML
   from its local label space and assigns the meaning as described. This
   approach, however, would be risky if the packet escaped and was
   processed by the downstream node.

5. Security Considerations

   OAM security is discussed in [OAM-FWK] and [OAM-SEC].

   OAM can provide useful information for detecting and tracing security
   attacks.

   OAM can also be used to illicitly gather information or for denial of
   service attacks. Implementations are required to offer security
   mechanisms for OAM. Deployments are strongly advised to use suh
   mechanisms.

6. IANA Considerations

   This revision of this document does not make any requests of IANA.

   If the solution described in Section 4 is adopted, a request will be
   made to IANA for the allocation of a new reserved label.

7. Acknowledgment
