2.  Introduction

   Comcast is a large broadband ISP, based in the U.S., serving the
   majority of its customers via cable modem technology.  A trial was
   recently conducted with Pando Networks, Yale, and several ISP members
   of the P4P Working Group, which is part of the Distributed Computing
   Industry Association (DCIA).  Comcast is a member of the P4P Working
   Group, whose mission is to work with Internet service providers
   (ISPs), peer to peer (P2P) companies, and technology researchers to
   develop "P4P" mechanisms that accelerate distribution of content and
   optimize utilization of ISP network resources.  P4P theoretically
   allows P2P networks to optimize traffic within each ISP, reducing the
   volume of data traversing the ISP's infrastructure and creating a
   more manageable flow of data.  P4P can also accelerate P2P downloads
   for end users.

   P4P's so-called "iTracker" technology was conceptually discussed with
   the IETF at the Peer to Peer Infrastructure (P2Pi) Workshop held on
   May 22, 2008, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
   This work was discussed in greater detail at the 72nd meeting of the
   IETF, in Dublin, Ireland, in the ALTO BoF on July 29, 2008.  Since
   that time, discussion of iTrackers has continued with participants of
   the ALTO BoF and P2Pi Workshop, as the IETF community plans for a
   second BoF at the 73rd meeting of the IETF in November, 2008.  At
   IETF 72, Comcast offered to share P4P trial data with the community,
   and to present this in some detail at the next ALTO BoF.

   The P4P trial was conducted, in cooperation with Pando, Yale, and
   three other P4P member ISPs, from July 2 to July 17, 2008.  This was
   the first P4P trial over a cable broadband network.  The trial used a
   Pando P2P client, and Pando distributed a special 21 MB licensed
   video file as in order to measure the effectiveness of P4P iTrackers.
   A primary objective of the trial was to measure the effects that
   increasing the localization of P2P swarms would have on P2P uploads,
   P2P downloads, and ISP networks, in comparison to normal P2P
   activity.


3.  High-Level Details

   There were five different swarms for the content used in the trial.

Internet-Draft           Comcast P4P Experiences            October 2008


   The first was a random P2P swarm, as a control group.  The second,
   third, and fourth used different P4P iTrackers: Generic, Coarse
   Grained, and Fine Grained.  The fifth was a proprietary Pando
   mechanism.  (The results of the fifth swarm, while very good, are not
   included here since our focus is on open standards and a mechanism
   which may be leveraged for the benefit of the entire community of P2P
   clients.)  During the trial, there were 15,518 downloads to Comcast-
   based P2P clients.  Comcast deployed an iTracker server in our
   production network to support this trial, and configued multiple
   iTracker files to provide varying levels of localization to clients.

   In the trial itself, a P2P client begins a P2P session by querying a
   pTracker, which runs and manages the P2P network.  The pTracker
   occasionally queries the iTracker, which in this case was maintained
   by Comcast, the ISP.  Other ISPs either managed their own iTracker or
   used Pando or Yale to host their iTracker files.  The iTracker
   returns network toplogy information to the pTracker, which then
   communicates with P2P clients, in order to enable P2P clients to make
   network-aware decisions regarding peers.


4.  High-Level Trial Results

   Trial data was collected by Pando Networks and Yale University, and
   raw trial results were shared with Comcast and all of the other ISPs
   involved in the trial.  Analysis of the raw results was performed by
   Pando and Yale, and these organizations delivered an analysis of the
   P4P trial.  Using the raw data, Comcast also analyzed the trial
   results.  Furthermore, the raw trial results for Comcast were shared
   with Net Forecast, Inc., which performed an independent analysis of
   the trial for Comcast.

   The results of the trial indicated that P4P can improve the speed of
   downloads to P2P clients.  In addition, P4P was effective in
   localizing P2P traffic within the Comcast network.

                      Table 1: IETF Meetings in 2005

   An analysis of the effects of P4P on upstream utilization and
   Internet transit was also interesting.  It did not appear that P4P
   significantly increased upstream utilization in our access network;
   in essence uploading was already occuring no matter what and P4P in
   and of itself did not appear to materially increase uploading for
   this specific, licensed content.  (P4P is not intended as a solution
   for the potential of network congestion to occur.)  Random was
   143,236 MB and P4P Generic Weight was 143,143 MB, while P4P Coarse
   Grained was 139,669 MB.  We also observed that P4P reduced outgoing
   Internet traffic by an average of 34% at peering points.  Random was
   134,219 MB and P4P Generic Weight was 91,979 MB, while P4P Coarse
   Grained was 86,652 MB.

   In terms of downstream utilization, we observed that P4P reduced
   incoming Internet traffic by an average of 80% at peering points.
   Random was 47,013 MB and P4P Generic Weight was 8,610 MB, while P4P
   Coarse Grained was 7,764 MB.  However, we did notice that download
   activity in our access network increased somewhat, from 56,030 MB for
   Random, to 59,765 MB for P4P Generic Weight, and 60,781 MB for P4P
   Coarse Grained.

   During the trial, downloads peaked at 24,728 per day, per swarm, or
   nearly 124,000 per day for all five swarms.  The swarm size peaked at
   11,703 peers per swarm, or nearly 57,000 peers for all five swarms.
   We observed a comparable number of downloads in each of the five
   swarms.

6.  Next Steps

   One objective of this document is to share with the IETF community
   the results of one P4P trial in a large broadband network, given
   skepticism regarding both the benefits to P2P users and to ISPs.
   From the perspective of P2P users, P4P potentially delivers faster
   P2P downloads.  At the same time, ISPs can increase the localization
   of swarms, enabling them to reduce bytes flowing over transit points,
   while also delivering an optimized P2P experience to customers.

   We believe these results can inform the technical discussion in the
   IETF over how to use iTracker mechanisms.  Should such a mechanism be
   standardized, the use of ISP-provided iTrackers should probably be an
   opt-in feature for P2P users, or at least a feature of which they are
   explicitly aware of and which has been enabled by default in a
   particular P2P client.  In this way, P2P users could choose to opt-in
   either explicitly or by their choice of P2P client in order to choose
   to use the iTracker to improve performance, which benefits both the
   user and the ISP at the same time.  Importantly in terms of privacy,
   the iTracker makes available only network topology information, and
   would not in its current form enable an ISP, via the iTracker, to
   determine what P2P clients were downloading what content.

   It is also possible that an iTracker type of mechanism, in
   combination with a P2P cache, could further improve P2P download
   performance, which merits further study.  In addition, this was a
   limited trial that, while very promising, indicates a need for
   additional technical investigation and trial work.  Such follow-up
   study should explore the effects of P4P when more P2P client software
   variants are involved, with larger swarms, and with additional and
   more technically diverse content (file size, file type, duration of
   content, etc.).
