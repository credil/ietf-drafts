Abstract

   This document describes a way to perform end-user authentication in
   the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework by re-
   using an external security layer (such as the Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) protocol) that may have already completed end-user
   authentication.  In comparison with the existing EXTERNAL mechanism,
   this mechanism alleviates the a priori assumptions made by the design
   of the EXTERNAL mechanism.  This mechanism transfers an identifier of
   the external channel to be used explicitly.

   See <http://josefsson.org/external-channel/> for more information.

Internet-Draft              EXTERNAL-CHANNEL                  April 2009


1.  Introduction

   The EXTERNAL mechanism, described in Appendix A of [RFC4422] allows a
   client to request the server to use credentials established by means
   external to the mechanism to authenticate the client.  The external
   means may be, for instance, TLS [RFC5246] or IP Security [RFC4301]
   services.

   The EXTERNAL mechanism requires some a prior agreement between the
   client and the server regarding which external channel, and
   consequently which external credentials, should be used for
   authentication.  In practice this has often meant that the EXTERNAL
   mechanism is only used when there is tight out of band interaction
   between the server administration and client user.  This has impacted
   the interoperability of the EXTERNAL mechanism.

   The EXTERNAL-CHANNEL mechanism, specified in this document, is
   similar to the EXTERNAL mechanism in that it relies on an external
   channel to perform the user authentication.  However, EXTERNAL-
   CHANNEL provides a way for the client to provide an identifier of the
   external channel that provides the user credentials.  The intention
   is that the server need not rely on a priori arrangement to identify
   the secure channel that was used, but can automatically find the
   intended channel and re-use its credentials for the SASL
   authentication.

   In the EXTERNAL-CHANNEL mechanism, the external channel is identified
   using the "Channel binding unique prefix" string as defined in
   [RFC5056].


2.  Technical Specification

   The name of this mechanism is "EXTERNAL-CHANNEL".

   The mechanism does not provide a security layer.  It provides similar
   functionality by relying on an external channel.

   The mechanism is capable of transferring a channel name and an
   authorization identity string.  If the authorization identity string
   is empty, the client is requesting to act as the identity the server
   has associated with the client's credentials.  If the authorization
   identity string is non-empty, the client is requesting to act as the
   identity represented by the string.  The channel name cannot be
   empty.

   The client is expected to send data first in the authentication
   exchange.  Where the client does not provide an initial response data

Internet-Draft              EXTERNAL-CHANNEL                  April 2009


   in its request to initiate the authentication exchange, the server is
   to respond to the request with an empty initial challenge and then
   the client is to provide its initial response.

   The client sends the initial response containing the channel name,
   and a UTF-8 [RFC3629] encoding of the requested authorization
   identity string.

   The authorization identity is non-empty when the client is requesting
   to act as the identity represented by the (non-empty) string.  The
   authorization identity is empty when the client is requesting to act
   as the identity the server associates with the external
   authentication credentials.

   The syntax of the initial response is specified as a value of the
   <extern-initial-resp> production detailed below using the Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

   external-initial-resp = cb-name " " authz-id-string

   cb-name               = 1*( US-ASCII / "." / "-")
        ;; Based on RFC 5056: "There is no naming convention for channel
        ;; bindings: any string composed of US-ASCII alphanumeric
        ;; characters, period ('.'), and dash ('-') will suffice."

   authz-id-string       = *( UTF8-char-no-nul )
   UTF8-char-no-nul      = UTF8-1-no-nul / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4
        ;; where the UTF8-2, UTF8-3, and UTF8-4 productions are
        ;; as defined in RFC 3629.

   UTF8-1-no-nul         = %x01-7F

   There are no additional challenges and responses.

   Hence, the server is to return the outcome of the authentication
   exchange.

   The exchange fails if

   - the cb-name denote an (to the server implementation) unknown or
   end-point channel binding type,

   - the client has not established its credentials via the indicated
   external channel,

   - the client's credentials are inadequate,

   - the client provided an empty authorization identity string and the

Internet-Draft              EXTERNAL-CHANNEL                  April 2009


   server is unwilling or unable to associate an authorization identity
   with the client's credentials,

   - the client provided a non-empty authorization identity string that
   is invalid per the syntax requirements of the applicable application
   protocol specification,

   - the client provided a non-empty authorization identity string
   representing an identity that the client is not allowed to act as, or

   - the server is unwilling or unable to provide service to the client
   for any other reason.

   Otherwise the exchange is successful.  When indicating a successful
   outcome, additional data is not provided.


3.  Examples

   This section provides examples of EXTERNAL-CHANNEL authentication
   exchanges.  The examples are intended to help the readers understand
   the above text.  The examples are not definitive.  The Application
   Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) [RFC2244] is used in the
   examples because ACAP sends the SASL tokens without additional
   encoding.

   The first example shows use of EXTERNAL-CHANNEL with an empty
   authorization identity and an external "tls-unique" channel.  In this
   example, the initial response is not sent in the client's request to
   initiate the authentication exchange.

         S: * ACAP (SASL "DIGEST-MD5")
         C: a001 STARTTLS
         S: a001 OK "Begin TLS negotiation now"
         <TLS negotiation, further commands are under TLS layer>
         S: * ACAP (SASL "DIGEST-MD5" "EXTERNAL-CHANNEL")
         C: a002 AUTHENTICATE "EXTERNAL-CHANNEL"
         S: + "tls-unique "
         C: + ""
         S: a002 OK "Authenticated"

   Note how the string ends with a " ", it needs to be present even if
   the authorization identity is empty.

   The second example shows use of EXTERNAL-CHANNEL with an
   authorization identity of "simon" bound to an external "tls-unique"
   channel.  In this example, the initial response is sent with the
   client's request to initiate the authentication exchange.  This saves

   a round-trip.

         S: * ACAP (SASL "DIGEST-MD5")
         C: a001 STARTTLS
         S: a001 OK "Begin TLS negotiation now"
         <TLS negotiation, further commands are under TLS layer>
         S: * ACAP (SASL "DIGEST-MD5" "EXTERNAL-CHANNEL")
         C: a002 AUTHENTICATE "EXTERNAL-CHANNEL" {16+}
         C: tls-unique simon
         S: a002 NO "Cannot assume requested authorization identity"

   Note how the server rejects the authentication attempt with an
   authorization-related error message.  Presumably the client
   credentials presented in the TLS session does not give the client
   authority to assume the identity of "simon".


4.  Making Authorization Decisions

   The server may use any mechanism to make authorization decisions.
   For illustration, we want to give some ideas on how this may work in
   practice.  This section is not normative.

   Typically the external channel will not use authentication identities
   that can be used by the application protocol that uses the SASL
   EXTERNAL-CHANNEL mechanism.  Thus, a mapping is normally required.
   There may be mappings from the external credential to a set of
   permitted identifiers, and a "default" identifier can be provided in
   the mapping table if the client do not specify a particular
   authorization identity.

   For example, when mapping from X.509 credentials used in TLS
   connections to simple usernames, a table stored on the server can
   contain hex-encoded hashes of client X.509 certificates and a set of
   usernames.

   d2fc512490a15036460b5489401439d6da5407fa joe

   The server could extract a successfully authenticated X.509 client
   certificate from the TLS stack, hash it and look it up in the mapping
   table.  Each of the usernames given would be permitted authorization
   identities.  The first username given may be the default username if
   the client does not provide an authorization identity.

   When mapping from OpenPGP credentials used in TLS [RFC5081], the
   mapping table could consist of verified OpenPGP fingerprints and a
   set of permitted usernames, such as the following table.

   When SRP authentication with TLS [RFC5054] is used, the username
   provided may be the same as the application username, and no mapping
   would be necessary.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is request to add to the SASL mechanisms registry the
   following entry.

       Subject: Registration of SASL mechanism EXTERNAL-CHANNEL
       SASL mechanism name (or prefix for the family): EXTERNAL-CHANNEL
       Security considerations: See security considerations in RFC XXXX.
       Published specification (recommended): RFC XXXX.
       Person & email address to contact for further information:
           Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>
       Intended usage: COMMON
       Owner/Change controller: Simon Josefsson <simon@josefsson.org>


6.  Security Considerations

   The EXTERNAL-CHANNEL mechanism does not authenticate users itself, it
   relies on implementation to perform the authentication as part of the
   external channel.  Care must be taken to ensure that the client
   credential has been authenticated, rather than just blindly accepted
   as part of a leap-of-faith setup.

   The security of external channel is critical to the security of this
   mechanism.  The connection between the authentication and the
   external channel is made by sending the name of the channel, so the
   security considerations related to channel bindings are also
   relevant, see [RFC5056].


7.  Acknowledgements

   The EXTERNAL-CHANNEL mechanism, and significant amount of text in
   this document, is based on the EXTERNAL mechanism in Appendix A of
   SASL [RFC4422].
