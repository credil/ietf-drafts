    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Web-based protocols often require the discovery of host policy or metadata, where host is
        not a single resource but the entity controlling the collection of resources identified by
        URIs with a common host as defined by <xref target="RFC3986"/>. While these protocols have
        a wide range of metadata needs, they often define metadata that is concise, has simple
        syntax requirements, and can benefit from storing its metadata in a common location used by
        other related protocols.
      </t>
      <t>
        Because there is no URI or a resource available to describe a host, many of the methods
        used for associating per-resource metadata (such as HTTP headers) are not available. This
        often leads to the overloading of the root HTTP resource (e.g. 'http://example.com/') with
        host metadata that is not specific to the root resource (e.g. a home page or web
        application), and which often has nothing to do it.
      </t>
      <t>
        This memo registers the "well-known" URI suffix 'host-meta' in the Well-Known URI Registry
        established by <xref target="I-D.nottingham-site-meta" />, and specifies a simple,
        general-purpose metadata document for hosts, to be used by multiple Web-based protocols.

          resource-specific metadata for each resource within the host-meta document scope:

          The host-meta document uses the XRD 1.0 XML namespace URI <xref target="W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114" />:

        </figure>
        <t>
        The XML namespace URI for the host-meta specific extension elements defined in this
        specification is:

      <section title="Notational Conventions">
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
          "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
          <xref target="RFC2119" />.
        </t>
        <t>
          This specification uses the namespace prefix "hm:" for the extension Namespace URI
          identified in <xref target="ns" />.  Note that the choice of namespace prefix is arbitrary
          and not semantically significant. Element names without a namespace prefix belong to the
          XRD 1.0 XML namespace identified in <xref target="ns" />.
        </t>
        <t>
          This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of <xref target="RFC5234" />.
          Additionally, the following rules are included from <xref target="RFC3986" />: reserved,
          unreserved, and host.
        </t>
      </section>
      
    </section>

    <section title="Metadata Scope">
      <t>
        Each host-meta document describes one or more hosts. The scope MUST be expressed explicitly
        within the document using the <xref target="Host element">'hm:Host' elements</xref>. The
        host-meta scope does not apply to any other hostname (or sub-domain) not explicitly
        declared. For example, 'example.net', 'example.com', and 'www.example.com' all have different
        and non-overlapping scopes.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="The host-meta Document Format">
      <t>
        The host-meta document uses the XRD 1.0 document format as defined by
        <xref target="OASIS.XRD-1.0" />, which provides a simple and extensible XML-based schema
        for describing resources. This memo defines additional elements and processing rules needed
        to describe hosts. XRD elements not explicitly mentioned in this memo are permitted and
        used as defined in <xref target="OASIS.XRD-1.0" />.
      </t>
      <t>
        The host-meta document root MUST be an 'XRD' element. The document SHOULD NOT include a
        'Subject' element, as at this time no URI is available to identify hosts. The use of the
        'Alias' element in host-meta is undefined and NOT RECOMMENDED.
      </t>
      <t>
        This memo defines the <xref target="Host element">'hm:Host' element</xref> for declaring
        document scope. The subject (or "context resource" as defined by
        <xref target="I-D.nottingham-http-link-header" />) of the XRD 'Type' and 'Link' elements
        are the hosts included in the document scope, with the exception of 'Link' elements with a
        'URITemplate' child element for which the subject are individual resources included in the
        document scope as defined in <xref target="Link element" />.
      </t>

      <section title="The 'hm:Host' Element" anchor="Host element">
        <t>
          The 'hm:Host" element is used to declare the scope of the host-meta document and
          is defined as a child element of the root 'XRD' element. The parent 'XRD' element MUST
          include one but MAY include more 'hm:Host' elements (order does not matter). If a
          host-meta document includes more than one 'hm:Host' element, it does not signify any
          relationship between the individual hosts other than sharing the same metadata.
        </t>

        </figure>
      </section>

      <section title="The 'Link' Element" anchor="Link element">
        <t>
          The XRD 'Link' element, when used with the 'URI' child element, conveys a link relation
          between the host (or hosts) described by the document and a common target URI.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example, the following link declares a common author for the entire scope:
          </preamble>
          <artwork  xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
    <Link>
        <Rel>author</Rel>
        <URI>http://example.com/author</URI>
    </Link>
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          In addition, a 'Link' element with a 'URITemplate' child element conveys relations whose
          context are individual resources within the host-meta document scope, and whose target is
          constructed by applying the context URI to a template.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example, a blog with multiple authors can provide information about each article's
            author by providing an endpoint with a parameter set to the URI of each article. Each
            article has a unique author, but all share the same pattern of where that information
            is located:

        <section title="Template Syntax" anchor="template_syntax">
          <t>
            This memo defines a simple template syntax for URI transformation. A template is a
            string containing brace-enclosed ("{}") variable names marking the parts of the string
            that are to be substituted by the corresponding variable values.
          </t>
          <t>
            Before substituting template variables, any value character other than unreserved (as
            defined by <xref target="RFC3986" />) MUST be percent-encoded per
            <xref target="RFC3986" />.
          </t>
          <t>
            This memo defines a single variable, 'uri', as the entire context URI. Protocols MAY
            define additional relation-specific variables and syntax rules, but SHOULD only do so
            for protocol-specific relation types, and MUST NOT change the meaning of the 'uri'
            variable. If a client is unable to successfully process a template (due to unknown
            variable names, or unknown or incompatible syntax) the parent 'Link' element SHOULD be
            ignored.

    <section title="Obtaining host-meta Documents" anchor="obtain">
      <t>
        The host-meta document is obtained by making an HTTP <xref target="RFC2616" /> GET request
        to the host's port 80, or an HTTPS <xref target="RFC2818" /> GET request to the host's
        port 443 for the '/.well-known/host-meta' path.
      </t>
      <t>
        Servers MUST support at least one but SHOULD support both ports unless restricted by
        other considerations. If both ports are supported, they MUST serve the same document.
        Clients MAY attempt to obtain the host-meta document from either port, and SHOULD
        attempt the other port if the first fails, unless restricted by other considerations.
      </t>
      <figure>
        <preamble>
          For example, the following request is used to obtain the host-meta document for the
          'example.com' host:
        </preamble>
        <artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
    GET /.well-known/host-meta HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
  ]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
        If the server response indicates that the host-meta resource is located elsewhere (a 301,
        302, or 307 response status codes), the client SHOULD try to obtain the resource from the
        location provided in the response. This means that the host-meta document for one host
        MAY be retrieved from a different host. Likewise, if the resource is not available or
        exists (the 404 or 410 response status codes), the client SHOULD infer that metadata is not
        available via this mechanism.
      </t>
      <t>
        If a representation is successfully obtained, but is not in the format described above,
        clients SHOULD infer that the path is being used for other purposes, and not process it as
        a host-meta document. To aid in this process, authorities using this mechanism SHOULD
        correctly label host-meta responses with the "application/xrd+xml" internet media type.
      </t>
      <t>
        The scope declared within the host-meta document MUST match the desired host.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="Security">
      <t>
        The metadata returned by the host-meta resource is presumed to be under the control of the
        appropriate authority and representative of all the resources described by it. If this
        resource is compromised or otherwise under the control of another party, it may represent a
        risk to the security of the server and data served by it, depending on what protocols use it.
      </t>
      <t>
        The host-meta scope is explicitly declared by the 'hm:Host' elements listed in the document.
        Clients SHOULD evaluate the authority of a host-meta document obtained from one host to
        describe any other host. Protocols that change the scope from the one declared in the
        document without careful consideration can incur security risks.
      </t>
      <t>
        Protocols using host-meta templates SHOULD evaluate the construction of their templates as
        well as any protocol-specific variables or syntax to ensure that the templates cannot be
        abused by an attacker. For example, a client can be tricked into following a malicious link
        due to a poorly constructed template which produces unexpected results when its variable
        values contain unexpected characters.
      </t>
      <t>
        Protocols MAY restrict document retrieval to HTTPS based on their security needs.
        Protocols utilizing host-meta documents obtained via other methods not described in this
        memo SHOULD consider the security and authority risks associated with such methods.
