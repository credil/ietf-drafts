1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   VPLS (Virtual Private LAN Service) is a provider service that
   emulates the full functionality of a traditional Local Area Network
   (LAN).  VPLS interconnects several customer LAN segments over a
   packet switched network (PSN) backbone, creating a multipoint-to-
   multipoint Ethernet VPN.  For customers, their remote LAN segments
   behave as one single LAN.

   In a VPLS, the provider network emulates a learning bridge, and
   forwarding takes place based on Ethernet MAC learning.  Hence, a VPLS
   requires MAC address learning/aging on a per PW (Pseudo Wire) basis,
   where forwarding decisions treat the PW as a "bridge port".

   VPLS is a Layer-2 service.  However, it provides two applications
   from the customer's point of view:

      - LAN Routing application: providing connectivity between customer
      routers
      - LAN Switching application: providing connectivity between
      customer Ethernet switches

   Thus, in some cases, customers across MAN/WAN have transparent
   Layer-2 connectivity while their main goal is to run Layer-3
   applications within their routing domain.  As a result, different
   requirements arise from their variety of applications.

   Originally, VPLS PEs transport broadcast/multicast Ethernet frames by
   replicating all multicast/broadcast frames received from an AC to all
   PW's corresponding to a particular VSI.  Such a technique has the
   advantage of keeping the P and PE devices completely unaware of IP
   multicast-specific issues.  Obviously, however, it has quite a few
   scalability drawbacks in terms of bandwidth consumption, which will
   lead to increased cost in large-scale deployment.

   Meanwhile, there is a growing need for support of multicast-based
   services such as IP TV.  This commercial trend makes it necessary for
   most VPLS deployments to support multicast more efficiently than
   before.  It is also necessary as customer routers are now likely to
   be running IP multicast protocols and those routers and connected to
   switches that will be handling large amounts of multicast traffic.

   Therefore, it is desirable to have more efficient techniques to
   support IP multicast over VPLS.

1.2.  Scope of this document

   This document provides functional requirements for network solutions
   that support IP multicast in VPLS [RFC4761] [RFC4762].  It identifies
   requirements that MAY apply to the existing base VPLS architecture in
   order to optimize IP multicast.  It also complements the generic L2
   VPN requirements document [RFC4665], by specifying additional
   requirements specific to the deployment of IP multicast in VPLS.

   The technical specifications are outside the scope of this document.
   There is no intent to either specify solution-specific details in
   this document or application-specific requirements.  Also, this
   document does NOT aim to express multicast-inferred requirements that
   are not specific to VPLS.  It does NOT aim to express any
   requirements for native Ethernet specifications, either.

   This document is proposed as a solution guideline and a checklist of
   requirements for solutions, by which we will evaluate how each
   solution satisfies the requirements.

   This document clarifies the needs from both VPLS customer as well as
   provider standpoints and formulates the problems that should be
   addressed by technical solutions while staying solution agnostic.

   A technical solution and corresponding service which supports this
   document's requirements are hereinafter called a "multicast VPLS".


2.  Conventions used in this document

2.1.  Terminology

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology, reference
   models and taxonomy defined in [RFC4664] and [RFC4665].  For
   readability purposes, we repeat some of the terms here.

   Moreover, we also propose some other terms needed when IP multicast
   support in VPLS is discussed.

   - ASM:  Any Source Multicast.  One of the two multicast service
      models where each corresponding service can have an arbitrary
      number of senders.

   - G:  denotes a multicast group.

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


   - MDTunnel:  Multicast Distribution Tunnel, the means by which the
      customer's multicast traffic will be conveyed across the SP
      network.  This is meant in a generic way: such tunnels can be
      point-to-point, point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-multipoint.
      Although this definition may seem to assume that distribution
      tunnels are unidirectional, the wording encompasses bi-directional
      tunnels as well.

   - Multicast Channel:  (S,G) in the SSM model.

   - Multicast domain:  An area in which multicast data is transmitted.
      In this document, this term has a generic meaning which can refer
      to Layer-2 and Layer-3.  Generally, the Layer-3 multicast domain
      is determined by the Layer-3 multicast protocol used to establish
      reachability between all potential receivers in the corresponding
      domain.  The Layer-2 multicast domain can be the same as the
      Layer-2 broadcast domain (i.e., VLAN), but it may be restricted to
      being smaller than the Layer-2 broadcast domain if an additional
      control protocol is used.

   - PE/CE:  Provider/Customer edge Equipment.

   - S:  denotes a multicast source.

   - SP:  Service Provider.

   - SSM:  Source Specific Multicast.  One of the two multicast service
      models where each corresponding service relies upon the use of a
      single source.

   - U-PE/N-PE:  The device closest to the customer/user is called User
      facing PE (U-PE) and the device closest to the core network is
      called Network facing PE (N-PE).

   - VPLS instance:  A service entity manageable in VPLS architecture.
      All CE devices participating in a single VPLS instance appear to
      be on the same LAN, composing a VPN across the SP's network.  A
      VPLS instance corresponds to a group of VSIs that are
      interconnected using PWs (Pseudo Wires).

   - VSI:  Virtual Switching Instance.  VSI is a logical entity in a PE
      that maps multiple ACs (Attachment Circuits) to multiple PWs
      (Pseudo Wires).  The VSI is populated in much the same way as a
      standard bridge populates its forwarding table.  Each PE device
      may have multiple VSIs, where each VSI belongs to a different VPLS
      instance.

2.2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] .


3.  Problem Statements

3.1.  Motivation

   Today, many kinds of IP multicast services are becoming available.
   Over their Layer-2 VPN service, particularly over VPLS, customers
   would often like to operate their multicast applications to remote
   sites.  Also, VPN service providers using an IP-based networks expect
   that such Layer-2 network infrastructure will efficiently support
   multicast data traffic.

   However, VPLS has a shortcoming as it relates to multicast
   scalability as mentioned below because of the replication mechanisms
   intrinsic to the original architecture.  Accordingly, the primary
   goal for technical solutions is to solve this issue partially or
   completely, and provide efficient ways to support IP multicast
   services over VPLS.

3.2.  Multicast Scalability

   In VPLS, replication occurs at an ingress PE when a CE sends (1)
   Broadcast, (2) Multicast or (3) Unknown destination unicast.  There
   are two well known issues with this approach:

   Issue A: Replication to non-member site

      In case (1) and (3), the upstream PE has to transmit packets to
      all of the downstream PEs which belong to the common VPLS
      instance.  You cannot decrease the number of members, so this is
      basically an inevitable situation for most VPLS deployments.

      In case (2), however, there is an issue that multicast traffic is
      sent to sites with no members.  Usually this is caused when the
      upstream PE does not maintain downstream membership information.
      The upstream PE simply floods frames to all downstream PEs, and
      the downstream PEs forward them to directly connected CEs;
      however, those CEs might not be the members of any multicast
      group.  From the perspective of customers, they might suffer from
      pressure on their own resources due to unnecessary traffic.  From
      the perspective of SPs, they would not like wasteful over-
      provisioning to cover such traffic.

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


   Issue B: Replication of PWs on shared physical path

      In VPLS, a VSI associated with each VPLS instance behaves as a
      logical emulated bridge which can transport Ethernet across the
      PSN backbone using PWs.  In principle, PWs are designed for
      unicast traffic.

      In all cases (1), (2) and (3), Ethernet frames are replicated on
      one or more PWs that belong to that VSI.  This replication is
      often inefficient in terms of bandwidth usage if those PWs are
      traversing shared physical links in the backbone.

      For instance, suppose there are 20 remote PEs belonging to a
      particular VPLS instance, and all PWs happen to be traversing over
      the same link from one local PE to its next-hop P. In this case,
      even if a CE sends 50Mbps to the local PE, the total bandwidth of
      that link will be to 1000Mbps.

      Note that while traditional 802.1D Ethernet switches replicate
      broadcast/multicast flows once at most per output interface, VPLS
      often needs to transmit one or more flows duplicated over the same
      output interface.

      From the perspective of customers, there is no serious issue
      because they do not know what happens in the core.  However, from
      the perspective of SPs, unnecessary replication brings the risk of
      resource exhaustion when the number of PWs increases.

   In both issues A and B, these undesirable situations will become
   obvious with the wide-spread use of IP multicast applications by
   customers.  Naturally the problem will become more serious as the
   number of sites grows.  In other words, there are concerns over the
   scalability of multicast in VPLS today.

3.3.  Application Considerations

3.3.1.  Two Perspectives of the Service

   When it comes to IP multicast over VPLS, there are two different
   aspects in terms of service provisioning.  They are closely related
   to the functional requirements from two technical standpoints:
   Layer-2 and Layer-3.

   - Native Ethernet service aspect

      This aspect mainly affects Ethernet network service operators.
      Their main interest is how to deal with the issue that existing
      VPLS deployments cannot always handle multicast/broadcast frames



Kamite, et al.           Expires March 15, 2008                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


      efficiently.

      Today, wide-area Ethernet services are becoming popular, and VPLS
      can be utilized to provide wide-area LAN services.  As customers
      come to use various kinds of content distribution applications
      which use IP multicast (or other protocols which lead to
      multicast/broadcast in the Ethernet layer), the total amount of
      traffic will also grow.  In addition, considerations of OAM,
      security and other related points in multicast in view of Layer-2
      are important as well.

      In such circumstances, the native VPLS specification would not
      always be satisfactory if multicast traffic is more dominant in
      total resource utilization than before.  The scalability issues
      mentioned in the previous section are expected to be solved.

   - IP multicast service aspect

      This aspect mainly affects both IP service providers and end
      users.  Their main interest is how to provide IP multicast
      services transparently but effectively by means of VPLS as a
      network infrastructure.

      SPs might expect VPLS as an access/metro network to deliver
      multicast traffic (such as Triple-play (Video, Voice, Data) and
      Multicast IP VPNs) in an efficient way.

      Furthermore, in some cases, IP service providers might expect
      operational simplicity of VPLS.  That is, they avoid direct and
      detailed knowledge of IP routing.  In this case, the multicast
      delivery mechanism is expected to have not only efficiency but
      also simplicity.  Generally speaking, there is a trade-off between
      efficiency and simplicity in terms of bandwidth usage and state
      maintenance, so the optimum trade-off will vary depending on the
      requirements of each IP service provider.


4.  General Requirements

   We assume the basic requirements for VPLS written in [RFC4665] are
   fulfilled if there is no special reference in this document.

4.1.  Scope of Transport

4.1.1.  Traffic Types

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


4.1.1.1.  Multicast and Broadcast

   As described before, any solution is expected to have mechanisms for
   efficient transport of IP multicast.  Multicast is related to both
   issues A and B; however, broadcast is related to issue B only because
   it does not need membership control.

   -  A multicast VPLS solution SHOULD attempt to solve both issues (A)
      and (B), if possible.  However, since some applications prioritize
      solving one issue over the other, the solution MUST identify which
      issue (A or B) it is attempting to solve.  The solution SHOULD
      provide a basis for evaluating how well it solves the issue(s) it
      is targeting, if it is providing an approximate solution.

4.1.1.2.  Unknown Destination Unicast

   Unknown destination MAC unicast requires flooding, but its
   characteristics are quite different from multicast/broadcast.  When
   the unicast MAC address is learned, the PE changes its forwarding
   behavior from flooding over all PWs into sending over one PW.
   Thereby it will require different technical studies from multicast/
   broadcast, which is out of scope of this document.

4.1.2.  Multicast Packet Types

   Ethernet multicast is used for conveying Layer-3 multicast data.
   When IP multicast is encapsulated by an Ethernet frame, the IP
   multicast group address is mapped to the Ethernet destination MAC
   address (beginning with 01-00-5E in hex).  Since the mapping between
   IPv4 multicast addresses and Ethernet layer multicast addresses is
   ambiguous (i.e., multiplicity of 1 Ethernet address to 32 IP
   addresses), MAC-based multicast forwarding is not ideal for IP
   multicast.

   Ethernet multicast is also used for Layer-2 control frames.  For
   example, BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Unit) for IEEE 802.1D Spanning
   Tree uses a multicast destination MAC address (01-80-C2-00-00-00).
   Also some of IEEE 802.1ag [802.1ag] Connectivity Fault Management
   (CFM) messages use a multicast destination MAC address dependent on
   their message type and application.  From the perspective of IP
   multicast, however, it is necessary in VPLS to flood such control
   frames to all participating CEs, without requiring any membership
   controls.

   As for a multicast VPLS solution, it can only use Ethernet-related
   information, if you stand by the strict application of the basic
   requirement: "a L2VPN service SHOULD be agnostic to customer's Layer
   3 traffic [RFC4665]."  This means no Layer-3 information should be

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


   checked for transport.  However, it is obvious this is an impediment
   to solve Issue A.

   Consequently, a multicast VPLS can be allowed to make use of some
   Layer-3-related supplementary information in order to improve
   transport efficiency.  In fact, today's LAN switch implementations
   often support such approaches and snoop upper layer protocols and
   examine IP multicast memberships (e.g., PIM snooping and IGMP/MLD
   snooping [RFC4541]).  This will implicitly suggest that VPLS may
   adopt similar techniques although this document does NOT state
   Layer-3 snooping is mandatory.  If such an approach is taken, careful
   consideration of Layer-3 state maintenance is necessary.  In
   addition, note that snooping approaches sometimes have disadvantages
   in the system's transparency; that is, one particular protocol's
   snooping solution might hinder other (especially future) protocol's
   working (e.g., an IGMPv2-snooping switch vs. a new IGMPv3-snooping
   one).  Also, note that there are potential alternatives to snooping:
   -  Static configuration of multicast Ethernet addresses and ports/
      interfaces
   -  Multicast control protocol based on Layer-2 technology which
      signals mappings of multicast addresses to ports/interfaces, such
      as GARP/GMRP[802.1D], CGMP[CGMP] and RGMP[RFC3488].

   On the basis described above, general requirements about packet types
   are given as follows:

   -  A solution SHOULD support a way to facilitate IP multicast
      forwarding of the customers.  It MAY observe Layer-3 information
      (i.e., multicast routing protocols and state) to the degree
      necessary, but any information irrelevant to multicast transport
      SHOULD NOT be consulted.

   -  In a solution, Layer-2 control frames (e.g., BPDU, 802.1ag CFM)
      SHOULD be flooded to all PE/CEs in a common VPLS instance.  A
      solution SHOULD NOT change or limit the flooding scope to remote
      PE/CEs in terms of end-point reachability.

   -  In a solution, Layer-2 frames that encapsulate Layer-3 multicast
      control packets (e.g., PIM, IGMP(for IPv4), MLD(for IPv6)) MAY be
      flooded only to relevant members, with the goal of limiting
      flooding scope.  However, Layer-2 frames that encapsulate other
      Layer-3 control packets (e.g., OSPF, ISIS) SHOULD be flooded to
      all PE/CEs in a VPLS instance.

4.2.  Static Solutions

   A solution SHOULD allow static configuration to account for various
   operator policies, where the logical multicast topology does not

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


   change dynamically in conjunction with a customer's multicast
   routing.

4.3.  Backward Compatibility

   A solution SHOULD be backward compatible with the existing VPLS
   solution.  It SHOULD allow a case where a common VPLS instance is
   composed of both PEs supporting the solution and PEs not supporting
   it, and the multicast forwarding enhancement is partially achieved by
   the compliant PEs.

   Note again that the existing VPLS solutions already have a simple
   flooding capability.  Thus this backward compatibility will give
   customers and SPs the improved efficiency of multicast forwarding
   incrementally as the solution is deployed.


5.  Customer Requirements

5.1.  CE-PE protocol

5.1.1.  Layer-2 Aspect

   A solution SHOULD allow transparent operation of Ethernet control
   protocols employed by customers (e.g.  Spanning Tree Protocol
   [802.1D]) and their seamless operation with multicast data transport.

   Solutions MAY examine Ethernet multicast control frames for the
   purpose of efficient dynamic transport (e.g.  GARP/GMRP [802.1D]).
   However, solutions MUST NOT assume all CEs are always running such
   protocols (typically in the case where a CE is a router and is not
   aware of Layer-2 details).

   A whole Layer-2 multicast frame (whether for data or control) SHOULD
   NOT be altered from a CE to CE(s) EXCEPT for the VLAN Id field,
   ensuring that it is transparently transported.  If VLAN Ids are
   assigned by the SP, they can be altered.  Note, however, when VLAN
   Ids are changed, Layer-2 protocols may be broken in some cases, such
   as Multiple Spanning Tree [802.1s].  Also if the Layer-2 frame is
   encapsulating Layer-3 multicast control packet (e.g., PIM/IGMP) and
   customers allow it to be regenerated at PE (aka proxy: see section
   5.1.2.), then the MAC address for that frame MAY be altered to the
   minimum necessary (e.g., use PE's own MAC address as a source).

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


5.1.2.  Layer-3 Aspect

   Again, a solution MAY examine customer's Layer-3 multicast protocol
   packets for the purpose of efficient and dynamic transport.  If it
   does, supported protocols SHOULD include:

   o  PIM-SM [RFC4601], PIM-SSM [RFC4607], bidirectional PIM
      [I-D.ietf-pim-bidir] and PIM-DM [RFC3973]
   o  IGMP (v1[RFC1112], v2[RFC2236] and v3[RFC3376]) (for IPv4
      solutions)
   o  Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol (MLD) (v1[RFC2710] and
      v2[RFC3810]) (for IPv6 solutions).

   A solution MUST NOT require any special Layer-3 multicast protocol
   packet processing by the end users.  However, it MAY require some
   configuration changes (e.g., turning explicit tracking on/off in
   PIM).

   A whole Layer-3 multicast packet (whether for data or control), which
   is encapsulated inside a Layer-2 frame, SHOULD NOT be altered from a
   CE to CE(s), ensuring that it is transparently transported.  However,
   as for Layer-3 multicast control (like PIM Join/Prune/Hello and IGMP
   Query/Report packet), it MAY be altered to the minimum necessary if
   such partial non-transparency is acceptable from point of view of the
   multicast service.  Similarly, a PE MAY consume such Layer-3
   multicast control packets and regenerate an entirely new packet if
   partial non-transparency is acceptable with legitimate reason for
   customers (aka proxy).

5.2.  Multicast Domain

   As noted in Section 2.1., the term "multicast domain" is used in a
   generic context for Layer-2 and Layer-3.

   A solution SHOULD honor customer multicast domains.  It MUST ensure
   that the provided Ethernet multicast domain always encompasses the
   corresponding customer Layer-3 multicast domain.

   A solution SHOULD optimize those domains' coverage sizes, i.e., a
   solution SHOULD ensure that unnecessary traffic is not sent to CEs
   with no members.  Ideally, the provided domain size will be close to
   that of the customer's Layer-3 multicast membership distribution;
   however, it is OPTIONAL to achieve such absolute optimality from the
   perspective of Layer-3.

   If a customer uses VLANs and a VLAN Id as a service delimiter (i.e.,
   each VPLS instance is represented by a unique customer VLAN tag
   carried by a frame through the UNI port), a solution MUST support



Kamite, et al.           Expires March 15, 2008                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


   separate multicast domains per VLAN Id.  Note that if VLAN Id
   translation is provided (i.e., if a customer VLAN at one site is
   mapped into a different customer VLAN at a different site), multicast
   domains will be created per set of VLAN Ids which are associated with
   translation.

   If a customer uses VLANs but a VLAN Id is not a service delimiter
   (i.e., the VPN disregards customer VLAN Ids), a solution MAY provide
   separate multicast domains per VLAN Id.  A SP is not required to
   provide separate multicast domains per VLAN IDs, but it may be
   considered beneficial to do so.

   A solution MAY build multicast domains based on Ethernet MAC
   addresses.  It MAY also build multicast domains based on the IP
   addresses inside Ethernet frames.  That is, PEs in each VPLS instance
   might control forwarding behavior and provide different multicast
   frame reachability depending on each MAC/IP destination address
   separately.  If IP multicast channels are fully considered in a
   solution, the provided domain size will be closer to actual channel
   reachability.

5.3.  Quality of Service (QoS)

   Customers require that multicast quality of service MUST be at least
   on par with what exists for unicast traffic.  Moreover, as multicast
   is often used to deliver high quality services such as TV broadcast,
   delay/jitter/loss sensitive traffic MUST be supported over multicast
   VPLS.

   To accomplish this, the solution MAY have additional features to
   support high QoS such as bandwidth reservation and flow admission
   control.  Also multicast VPLS deployment SHALL benefit from IEEE
   802.1p CoS techniques [802.1D] and DiffServ [RFC2475] mechanisms.

   Moreover, multicast traffic SHOULD NOT affect the QoS that unicast
   traffic receives and vice versa.  That is, separation of multicast
   and unicast traffic in terms of QoS is necessary.

5.4.  SLA Parameters Measurement

   Since SLA parameters are part of the service sold to customers, they
   simply want to verify their application performance by measuring the
   parameters SP(s) provide.

   Multicast specific characteristics that may be monitored are, for
   instance, multicast statistics per stream (e.g. total/incoming/
   outgoing/dropped traffic by period of time), one-way delay, jitter
   and group join/leave delay (time to start receiving traffic from a



Kamite, et al.           Expires March 15, 2008                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


   multicast group across the VPN since join/leave was issued).  An
   operator may also wish to compare the difference in one-way delay for
   a solitary multicast group/stream from a single, source PE to
   multiple receiver PEs.

   A solution SHOULD provide these parameters with Ethernet multicast
   group level granularity.  (For example, multicast MAC address will be
   one of those entries for classifying flows with statistics, delay and
   so on.)  However, if a solution is aimed at IP multicast transport
   efficiency, it MAY support IP multicast level granularity.  (For
   example, multicast IP address/channel will be entries for latency
   time.)

   In order to monitor them, standard interfaces for statistics
   gathering SHOULD also be provided (e.g., standard SNMP MIB Modules).

5.5.  Security

   A solution MUST provide customers with architectures that give the
   same level of security both for unicast and multicast.

5.5.1.  Isolation from Unicast

   Solutions SHOULD NOT affect any forwarding information base,
   throughput or resiliency etc. of unicast frames; that is, they SHOULD
   provide isolation from unicast.

5.5.2.  Access Control

   A solution MAY filter multicast traffic inside a VPLS, upon the
   request of an individual customer, (for example, MAC/VLAN filtering,
   IP multicast channel filtering, etc.).

5.5.3.  Policing and Shaping on Multicast

   A solution SHOULD support policing and shaping multicast traffic on a
   per customer basis and on a per AC (Attachment Circuit) basis.  This
   is intended to prevent multicast traffic from exhausting resources
   for unicast inside a common customer's VPN.  This might also be
   beneficial for QoS separation (see section 5.3).

5.6.  Access Connectivity

   First and foremost various physical connectivity types described in
   [RFC4665] MUST be supported.

   For particular reference here, a multicast VPLS MUST allow a
   situation in which a CE is dual-homed to two different SPs via



Kamite, et al.           Expires March 15, 2008                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


   diverse access networks -- one is supporting multicast VPLS but the
   other is not supporting it, (because it is an existing VPLS or
   802.1Q/QinQ network).

5.7.  Protection and Restoration

   A multicast VPLS infrastructure SHOULD allow redundant paths to
   assure high availability.

   Multicast forwarding restoration time MUST NOT be greater than the
   restoration time of a customer's Layer-3 multicast protocols.  For
   example, if a customer uses PIM with default configuration, hello
   hold timer is 105 seconds, and solutions are required to detect a
   failure no later than this period.

   Moreover, if multicast forwarding was not successfully restored
   (e.g., in case of no redundant paths), a solution MAY raise alarms to
   provide outage notification to customers before such a hold timer
   expires.

5.8.  Minimum MTU

   Multicast applications are often sensitive to packet fragmentation
   and reassembly, so the requirement to avoid fragmentation might be
   stronger than the existing VPLS solution.

   A solution SHOULD provide customers with enough committed minimum MTU
   (i.e., service MTU) for multicast Ethernet frames to ensure that IP
   fragmentation between customer sites never occurs.  It MAY give
   different MTU sizes to multicast and unicast.

5.9.  Frame Reordering Prevention

   A solution SHOULD attempt to prevent frame reordering when delivering
   customer multicast traffic.  Likewise, for unicast and unknown
   unicast traffic, it SHOULD attempt not to increase the likelihood of
   reordering compared with existing VPLS solutions.

   It is to be noted that delivery of out-of-order frames is not
   avoidable in certain cases.  Specifically if a solution adopts some
   MDTunnels (see section 6.2.1) and dynamically selects them for
   optimized delivery (e.g., switching from one aggregate tree to
   another), end-to-end data delivery is prone to be out-of-order.  This
   fact can be considered a trade-off between bandwidth optimization and
   network stability.  Therefore, such a solution is expected to promote
   awareness about this kind of drawback.

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


5.10.  Fate-Sharing between Unicast and Multicast

   In native Ethernet, multicast and unicast connectivity are often
   managed together.  For instance, 802.1ag CFM Continuity Check message
   is forwarded by multicast as a periodic heartbeat, but it is supposed
   to check the "whole" traffic continuity regardless of unicast or
   multicast, at the same time.  Hence, the aliveness of unicast and
   multicast is naturally coupled (i.e., fate-shared) in this customer's
   environment.

   A multicast VPLS solution may decouple the path that a customer's
   unicast and multicast traffic follow through a SP's backbone, in
   order to provide the most optimal path for multicast data traffic.
   This may cause concern among some multicast VPLS customers who desire
   that, during a failure in the SP's network, both unicast and
   multicast traffic fail concurrently.

   Therefore, there will be an additional requirement that makes both
   unicast and multicast connectivity coupled.  This means that if
   either one of them have a failure, the other is also disabled.  If
   one of the services (either unicast or multicast) becomes
   operational, the other is also activated simultaneously.

   -  It SHOULD be identified if the solution can provide customers with
      fate-sharing between unicast and multicast connectivity for their
      LAN switching application.  It MAY have a configurable mechanism
      for SPs to provide that on behalf of customers, e.g., aliveness
      synchronization, but its use is OPTIONAL.

   Note that how serious this issue is depends on each customer's stance
   in Ethernet operation.  If all CEs are IP routers i.e., if VPLS is
   provided for LAN routing application, the customer might not care
   about it because both unicast and multicast connectivity is assured
   in IP layer.  If the CE routers are running an IGP (e.g., OSPF/IS-IS)
   and a multicast routing protocol (e.g., PIM), then aliveness of both
   the unicast and multicast paths will be detected by the CEs.  This
   does not guarantee that unicast and multicast traffic are to follow
   the same path in the SP's backbone network, but does mitigate this
   issue to some degree.


6.  Service Provider Network Requirements

6.1.  Scalability

   The existing VPLS architecture has major advantages in scalability.
   For example, P-routers are free from maintaining customers'
   information because customer traffic is encapsulated in PSN tunnels.



Kamite, et al.           Expires March 15, 2008                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


   Also a PW's split-horizon technique can prevent loops, making PE
   routers free from maintaining complicated spanning trees.

   However, a multicast VPLS needs additional scalability considerations
   related to its expected enhanced mechanisms.  [RFC3809] lists common
   L2VPN sizing and scalability requirements and metrics, which are
   applicable in multicast VPLS too.  Accordingly, this section deals
   with specific requirements related to scalability.

6.1.1.  Trade-off of Optimality and State Resource

   A solution needs to improve the scalability of multicast as is shown
   in section 3:

      Issue A: Replication to non-member site.
      Issue B: Replication of PWs on shared physical path.

   For both issues, the optimization of physical resources (i.e. link
   bandwidth usage and router duplication performance) will become a
   major goal.  However, there is a trade-off between optimality and
   state resource consumption.

   In order to solve Issue A, a PE might have to maintain multicast
   group information for CEs which was not kept in the existing VPLS
   solutions.  This will present scalability concerns about state
   resources (memory, CPU, etc.) and their maintenance complexity.

   In order to solve Issue B, PE and P routers might have to have
   knowledge of additional membership information for remote PEs, and
   possibly additional tree topology information, when they are using
   point-to-multipoint techniques (PIM tree, P2MP-LSP, etc.).

   Consequently, the scalability evaluation of multicast VPLS solutions
   needs a careful trade-off analysis between bandwidth optimality and
   state resource consumption.

6.1.2.  Key Metrics for Scalability

      (Note: This part has a number of similar characteristics to
      requirements for Layer 3 Multicast VPN [RFC4834].)

   A multicast VPLS solution MUST be designed to scale well with an
   increase in the number of any of the following metrics:








Kamite, et al.           Expires March 15, 2008                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


   -  the number of PEs
   -  the number of VPLS instances (total and per PE)
   -  the number of PEs and sites in any VPLS instance
   -  the number of client VLAN Ids
   -  the number of client Layer-2 MAC multicast groups
   -  the number of client Layer-3 multicast channels (groups or source-
      groups)
   -  the number of PWs and PSN Tunnels (MDTunnels) (total and per PE)

   Each multicast VPLS solution SHALL document its scalability
   characteristics in quantitative terms.  A solution SHOULD quantify
   the amount of state that a PE and a P device has to support.

   The scalability characteristics SHOULD include:

   -  the processing resources required by the control plane in managing
      PWs (neighborhood or session maintenance messages, keepalives,
      timers, etc.)
   -  the processing resources required by the control plane in managing
      PSN tunnels
   -  the memory resources needed for the control plane
   -  the amount of protocol information transmitted to manage a
      multicast VPLS (e.g. signaling throughput)
   -  the amount of Layer-2/Layer-3 multicast information a P/PE router
      consumes (e.g. traffic rate of join/leave, keepalives etc.)
   -  the number of multicast IP addresses used (if IP multicast in ASM
      mode is proposed as a multicast distribution tunnel)
   -  other particular elements inherent to each solution that impact
      scalability

   Another metric for scalability is operational complexity.  Operations
   will naturally become more complicated if the number of managed
   objects (e.g., multicast groups) increases, or the topology changes
   occur more frequently.  A solution SHOULD note the factors which lead
   to additional operational complexity.

6.2.  Tunneling Requirements

6.2.1.  Tunneling Technologies

   A MDTunnel denotes a multicast distribution tunnel.  This is a
   generic term for tunneling where customer multicast traffic is
   carried over a provider's network.  In the L2VPN service context, it
   will correspond to a PSN tunnel.

   A solution SHOULD be able to use a range of tunneling technologies,
   including point-to-point (unicast oriented) and point-to-multipoint/
   multipoint-to-multipoint (multicast oriented).  For example, today



Kamite, et al.           Expires March 15, 2008                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


   there are many kinds of protocols for tunneling such as L2TP, IP,
   (including multicast IP trees), MPLS (including P2MP-LSP
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-rsvp-te-p2mp] and P2MP/MP2MP-LSP
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] ), etc.

   Note that which variant, point-to-point, point-to-multipoint or
   multipoint-to-multipoint, is used depends largely on the trade-offs
   mentioned above and the targeted network and applications.
   Therefore, this document does not mandate any specific protocols.  A
   solution, however, SHOULD state reasonable criteria if it adopts a
   specific kind of tunneling protocol.

6.2.2.  MTU of MDTunnel

   From the view of a SP, it is not acceptable to have fragmentation/
   reassembly so often while packets are traversing a MDTunnel.
   Therefore, a solution SHOULD support a method that provides the
   minimum path MTU of the MDTunnel in order to accommodate the service
   MTU.

6.3.  Robustness

   Multicast VPLS solutions SHOULD avoid single points of failures or
   propose technical solutions that make it possible to implement a
   failover mechanism.

6.4.  Discovering Related Information

   The operation of a multicast VPLS solution SHALL be as light as
   possible and providing automatic configuration and discovery SHOULD
   be considered a high priority.

   Therefore, in addition to the L2VPN discovery requirements in
   [RFC4665], a multicast VPLS solution SHOULD provide a method that
   dynamically allows multicast membership information to be discovered
   by PEs.  Such membership information is, for example, a set of
   multicast addresses.  What information is provided dynamically is
   solution specific.

6.5.  Operation, Administration and Maintenance

6.5.1.  Activation

   The activation of multicast enhancement in a solution MUST be
   possible:






Kamite, et al.           Expires March 15, 2008                [Page 20]

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


   o  with a VPLS instance granularity
   o  with an Attachment Circuit granularity (i.e., with a PE-CE
      Ethernet port granularity, or with a VLAN Id granularity when it
      is a service delimiter)

   Also it SHOULD be possible:

   o  with a CE granularity (when multiple CEs of a same VPN are
      associated with a common VPLS instance)
   o  with a distinction between multicast reception and emission
   o  with a multicast MAC address granularity
   o  with a customer IP multicast group and/or channel granularity
      (when Layer-3 information is consulted)

   Also it MAY be possible:

   o  with a VLAN Id granularity when it is not a service delimiter

6.5.2.  Testing

   A solution MUST provide a mechanism for testing multicast data
   connectivity and verifying the associated information.  Examples that
   SHOULD be supported which are specific to multicast are:

   -  Testing connectivity per multicast MAC address
   -  Testing connectivity per multicast Layer-3 group/channel
   -  Verifying data plane and control plane integrity (e.g.  PW,
      MDTunnel)
   -  Verifying multicast membership-relevant information (e.g.
      multicast MAC-addresses/PW-ports associations, Layer-3 group
      associations)

   Operators usually want to test if an end-to-end multicast user's
   connectivity is OK before and after activation.  Such end-to-end
   multicast connectivity checking SHOULD enable the end-to-end testing
   of the data path used by that customer's multicast data packets.
   Specifically, end-to-end checking will have CE-to-CE path test and
   PE-to-PE path test.  A solution MUST support PE-to-PE path test and
   MAY support CE-to-CE path test.

   Also operators will want to make use of a testing mechanism for
   diagnosis and troubleshooting.  In particular, a solution SHOULD be
   able to monitor information describing how client multicast traffic
   is carried over the SP network.  Note that if a solution supports
   frequent dynamic membership changes with optimized transport,
   troubleshooting within the SP's network will tend to be difficult.

6.5.3.  Performance Management

   Mechanisms to monitor multicast specific parameters and statistics
   MUST be offered to the SP.

      (Note: This part has a number of similar characteristics to
      requirements for Layer 3 Multicast VPN [RFC4834].)

   A solution MUST provide SPs with access to:

   -  Multicast traffic statistics (total traffic forwarded, incoming,
      outgoing, dropped, etc., by period of time)

   A solution SHOULD provide access to:

   -  Information about a customer's multicast resource usage (the
      amount of multicast state and throughput)
   -  Performance information related to multicast traffic usage, e.g.,
      one-way delay, jitter, loss, delay variations (the difference in
      one-way delay for a solitary multicast group/stream from a single,
      source PE to multiple receiver PEs) etc.
   -  Alarms when limits are reached on such resources
   -  Statistics on decisions related to how client traffic is carried
      on MDTunnels (e.g.  "How much traffic was switched onto a
      multicast tree dedicated to such groups or channels")
   -  Statistics on parameters that could help the provider to evaluate
      its optimality/state trade-off

   All or part of this information SHOULD be made available through
   standardized SNMP MIB Modules (Management Information Base).

6.5.4.  Fault Management

   A multicast VPLS solution needs to consider those management steps
   taken by SPs below:

   o  Fault detection
         A solution MUST provide tools that detect group membership/
         reachability failure and traffic looping for multicast
         transport.  It is anticipated that such tools are coordinated
         with the testing mechanisms mentioned in 6.5.2.

         In particular, such mechanisms SHOULD be able to detect a
         multicast failure quickly, (on par with unicast cases).  It
         SHOULD also avoid situations where multicast traffic has been
         in a failure state for a relatively long time while unicast
         traffic remains operational.  If such a situation were to
         occur, it would end up causing problems with customer

         applications that depend on a combination of unicast and
         multicast forwarding.

         With multicast, there may be many receivers associated with a
         particular mulitcast stream/group.  As the number of receivers
         increases, the number of places (typically nearest the
         receivers) required to detect a fault will increase
         proportionately.  This raises concerns over the scalability of
         fault detection in large multicast deployments.  Consequently,
         a fault detection solution SHOULD scale well; in particular, a
         solution should consider key metrics for scalability as
         described in section 6.1.2.

   o  Fault notification
         A solution MUST also provide fault notification and trouble
         tracking mechanisms. (e.g.  SNMP-trap and syslog.)

         In case of multicast, one point of failure often affects a
         number of downstream routers/receivers that might be able to
         raise a notification.  Hence notification messages MAY be
         summarized or compressed for operators' ease of management.

   o  Fault isolation
         A solution MUST provide diagnostic/troubleshooting tools for
         multicast as well.  Also it is anticipated that such tools are
         coordinated with the testing mechanisms mentioned in 6.5.2.

         In particular, a solution needs to correctly identify the area
         inside a multicast group impacted by the failure.  A solution
         SHOULD be able to diagnose if an entire multicast group is
         faulty or if some specific destinations are still alive.

6.6.  Security

   A SP network MUST be invulnerable to malformed or maliciously
   constructed customer traffic.  This applies to both multicast data
   packets and multicast control packets.

   Moreover, because multicast, broadcast, and unknown-unicast need more
   resources than unicast, a SP network MUST have safeguards against
   unwanted or malicious multicast traffic.  This applies to both
   multicast data packets and multicast control packets.

   Specifically, a multicast VPLS solution SHOULD have mechanisms to
   protect a SP network from:

Internet-Draft         Multicast VPLS Requirements              Sep 2007


   -  invalid multicast MAC addresses (always)
   -  invalid multicast IP addresses (if they are used for forwarding)
   -  malformed Ethernet multicast control protocol frames (if they are
      examined)
   -  malformed IP multicast control protocol packets (if they are
      examined)
   -  high volumes of
      *  valid/invalid customer control packets
      *  valid/invalid customer data packets (broadcast/multicast/
         unknown-unicast)

   The following are a few additional guidelines.

      A solution MAY allow some bounds on the quantity of state used by
      a VPN to be imposed in order to prevent state resource exhaustion
      (i.e., lack of memory, CPU etc.).

      Also a solution MAY allow a policing mechanism to limit the
      unwanted data traffic shown above.  In this case, while policing
      MAY be configurable to the sum of unicast, multicast, broadcast
      and unknown unicast traffic, it MAY also be configurable to each
      such type of traffic individually, or to their combination in
      order to prevent physical resource exhaustion (i.e., lack of
      bandwidth and degradation of throughput).

      Moreover, mechanisms to limit frequent changes of group membership
      by customers MAY be supported.  For example, if the core
      distribution tunnel is tightly coupled to dynamic changes of
      customer multicast domain, a kind of dampening function should be
      possible.

6.7.  Hierarchical VPLS support

   A VPLS multicast solution SHOULD allow a hierarchical VPLS (H-VPLS)
   [RFC4762] service model.  In other words, a solution is expected to
   operate seamlessly with existing hub and spoke PW connectivity.

   Note that it is also important to take into account the case of
   redundant spoke connections between U-PEs and N-PEs.

6.8.  L2VPN Wholesale

   A solution MUST allow a situation where one SP is offering L2VPN
   services to another SP.  One example here is a wholesale model where
   one VPLS interconnects other SPs' VPLS or 802.1D network islands.
   For customer SP, their multicast forwarding can be optimized by
   making use of multicast VPLS in the wholesaler SP.

7.  Security Considerations

   Security concerns and requirements for a base VPLS solution are
   described in [RFC4665].

   In additions, there are security considerations specific to multicast
   VPLS.  Thus a set of security issues have been identified that MUST
   be addressed when considering the design and deployment of multicast
   VPLS.  Such issues have been described in Section 5.5 and 6.6.


8.  IANA Considerations
