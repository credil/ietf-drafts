Internet-Draft            BGP-4 MIB, Version 2             November 2008


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for managing the Border Gateway Protocol, Version 4
   [RFC4271].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   As part of the IETF standardization effort for the BGP-4 protocol,
   [RFC4273] was written to address open issues in the previous version
   of the BGP-4 MIB, [RFC1657].  However, that RFC was primarily
   intended to address the base BGP-4 protocol as documented in
   [RFC4271].

   The BGP-4 protocol has greatly increased in scope over the years from
   its original definition.  Scaling mechanisms such as Route Reflection
   [RFC4456] and Confederations [RFC5065] have been introduced.  Multi-
   protocol extensions [RFC4760] were introduced which allowed
   advertisement of reachability such as IPv6 [RFC2545], MPLS Labeled
   routes [RFC3107], etc.

   This MIB addresses several of the deficiencies of the previous BGP-4
   MIB.  In particular:

Internet-Draft            BGP-4 MIB, Version 2             November 2008


   o  Add the ability to monitor IPv6 BGP-4 peering sessions and carry
      IPv6 reachability.  Other forms of reachability can be added at a
      later date courtesy of the address-family independent manner in
      which this was done.

   o  Add several counters of operational interest.  For example, the
      number of routes received from a given BGP peer.

   o  Replaces objects that were incapable of carrying the full range of
      their values with ones that can.

   o  Provides human-readable output for some complex data structures,
      such as the AS_PATH while also preserving a version of the data
      that is canonically machine readable.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

5.1.  Notifications

   o  bgp4V2EstablishedNotification - Sent when a BGP peer transitions
      into the Established state.  Replaces the previous
      bgpEstablishedNotification from RFC 4273 which was not address
      family independent.

   o  bgp4V2BackwardTransitionNotification - Sent when a BGP peer
      transitions out of the Established state.  Replaces the previous
      bgpBackwardTransNotification, which was not address family
      independent.

5.2.  Tables

   o  bgp4V2DiscontinuityTable - This MIB allows management of more than
      one instance of the BGP-4 protocol.  This table provides the
      ability to show when a given instance of BGP-4 has suffered an
      event that may lead to a discontinuity in its objects.

   o  bgp4V2PeerTable - The BGP peer table.  This table is capable of
      representing IPv6 and other address-family independent peering
      sessions.  This table replaces the bgpPeerTable from RFC 4273.

   o  bgp4V2PeerErrorsTable - A table of peering session errors.  This
      table covers information previously present in bgpPeerTable from
      RFC 4273.

   o  bgp4V2PeerEventTimesTable - A table of peer-specific event timers.
      This table covers information previously present in bgpPeerTable
      in RFC 4273 .

Internet-Draft            BGP-4 MIB, Version 2             November 2008


   o  bgp4V2PeerConfiguredTimersTable - A table of the configured values
      of peer-specific event timers.  This table covers information
      previously present in bgpPeerTable from RFC 4273.

   o  bgp4V2PeerNegotiatedTimersTable - A table of per-peer negotiated
      timers.  This information covers information previously derived
      from the bgpPeerTable from RFC 4273.

   o  bgp4V2PeerCountersTable - A table of per-peer counters for
      messages and the BGP FSM.

   o  bgp4V2PrefixGaugesTable - A table of per-peer per Address Family
      Identifer-Subsequent Address Family Identifier (AFI-SAFI)
      [RFC4760] gauges for prefixes.

   o  bgp4V2NlriTable - A table of per-peer per AFI-SAFI prefix data.
      This table covers information previously present in
      bgp4PathAttrTable from RFC 4273.

   o  bgp4V2AdjRibsOutTable - A per-peer per AFI-SAFI table indicating
      what reachability has been advertised to a given peer.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the TCP-MIB

   The bgp4V2PeerLocalAddrType/bgp4V2PeerLocalAddr/bgp4V2PeerLocalPort
   and bgp4V2PeerRemoteAddrType/bgp4V2PeerRemoteAddr/
   bgp4V2PeerRemotePort objects may provide a suitable index for
   monitoring the BGP peering session's TCP session via the TCP-MIB
   [RFC4022].

   Note that conducting BGP peering sessions over transport protocols
   other than TCP over IP are out of scope of the current BGP
   specifications.

6.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from BGP4V2-TC-MIB
   [I-D.draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-mibv2-tc], SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC
   [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001] and
   SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411].

        STATUS     current
        DESCRIPTION
            "In order to provide a canonicalized form of the BGP-4
             AS_PATH along with the human-readable
             bgp4V2NlriAsPathString, which may be truncated, this object
             contains the contents of the BGP-4 AS_PATH Path Attribute.
             This object may be parsed using the rules defined for
             Four-octet ASes as defined in RFC 4893.  RFC 4271, Section
             4.3, 'Path Attributes: b) AS_PATH' as amended by RFC 5065,
             Section 3 defines the general format of the AS_PATH path
             attribute and its code points.

             In brief, the AS_PATH is composed of a sequence of AS
             Segments.  Each AS Segment is represented by a triple:
             <path segment type, path segment length,
             path segment value>.

             The path segment type and path segment length fields are
             one octet in length each.

             The path segment type field may be one of:
               1 - AS_SET (RFC 4721, Section 4.3)
               2 - AS_SEQUENCE (RFC 4721, Section 4.3)
               3 - AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE (RFC 3065, Section 5)
               4 - AS_CONFED_SET (RFC 3065, Section 5)

             The path segment length field contains the number of ASes
             (not the number of octets) in the path segment value field.

             The path segment value field contains one or more AS
             numbers, each encoded as a 4-octet length field in network
             byte order.

             Note that since an SNMP agent may truncate this object to
             less than its maximum theoretical length of 4072 octets
             users of this object should be prepared to deal with a
             truncated and thus malformed AS_PATH.  It is RECOMMENDED
             that when such truncation would occur on the boundary of an
             encoded AS that the partial AS be discarded from this
             object and the object's size be adjusted accordingly.
             Further, it is also RECOMMENDED that when such truncation,
             either alone or in conjuction with the truncation of a
             partially encoded AS described previously, would yield an
             empty path segment value field that the path segment type
             and path segment length components of the truncated AS_PATH
             also be discarded and the object's size be adjusted

8.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to



Haas                       Expires May 6, 2009                 [Page 42]

Internet-Draft            BGP-4 MIB, Version 2             November 2008


   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  bgp4V2PeerLocalAddrType, bgp4V2PeerLocalAddr, bgp4V2PeerLocalPort
      bgp4V2PeerRemoteAddrType, bgp4V2PeerRemoteAddr,
      bgp4V2PeerRemotePort, bgp4V2PeerLocalAddr, bgp4V2PeerLocalPort,
      bgp4V2PeerRemoteAddr, bgp4V2PeerRemotePort - A BGP peer's local
      and remote addresses might be sensitive for ISPs who want to keep
      interface addresses on routers confidential in order to prevent
      router addresses used for a denial of service attack or spoofing.
      Note that other tables which share elements of these objects as
      indexes may similarly expose sensitive information.

   o  bgp4V2NlriTable, bgp4V2AdjRibsOutTable - A BGP peer's routing
      information may be sensitive for ISPs as the contents of their
      routing tables may expose details related to business
      relationships as implemented in Internet routing.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign this MIB module an OID under mib-2.

   operational needs, Internet operational security considerations and
   the sheer messiness of representing the BGP protocol in SMIv2.

   I owe particular thanks to Susan Hares as a mentor who let me dive
   head-first into the world of Internet standards work by saying, "We
   have this MIB that just needs a little cleanup to advance in the
   standards process."

11.  Acknowledgements

   We would like to acknowledge the assistance of all the members of the
   Inter-Domain Routing Working Group, all individuals you contributed
   to RFCs 1269, 1657 and 4273.

   The origin of this document is from RFC 1269 "Definitions of Managed
   Objects for the Border Gateway Protocol (Version 3)" written by Steve
   Willis and John Burruss, which was updated by John Chu to support
   BGP-4 in RFC 1657.  The author wishes to acknowledge the fine work of
   these original authors.
