      Simple Authentication Schemes for the ALC and NORM Protocols
               draft-ietf-rmt-simple-auth-for-alc-norm-03

Abstract

   This document introduces four schemes that provide a per-packet
   authentication and integrity service in the context of the ALC and
   NORM protocols.  The first scheme is based on digital signatures.
   Because it relies on asymmetric cryptography, this scheme generates a
   high processing load at the sender and to a lesser extent at a
   receiver, as well as a significant transmission overhead.  It is
   therefore well suited to low data rate sessions.  The second scheme
   relies on the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).  If
   this approach also relies an asymmetric cryptography, the processing
   load and the transmission overhead are significantly reduced compared
   to traditional digital signature schemes.  It is therefore well
   suited to medium data rate sessions.  The third scheme relies on a
   group Message Authentication Code (MAC).  Because this scheme relies
   on symmetric cryptography, MAC calculation and verification are fast
   operations, which makes it suited to high data rate sessions.
   However it only provides a group authentication and integrity
   service, which means that it only protects against attackers that are
   not group members.  Finally, the fourth scheme merges the digital
   signature and group group schemes, and is useful to mitigate DoS
   attacks coming from attackers that are not group members.

Internet-Draft   Simple authentication for ALC and NORM        July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Many applications using multicast and broadcast communications
   require that each receiver be able to authenticate the source of any
   packet it receives to check check its integrity.  For instance, ALC
   [RFC5775] and NORM [RFC5740] are two Content Delivery Protocols (CDP)
   designed to transfer reliably objects (e.g. files) between a
   session's sender and several receivers.

   The NORM protocol is based on bidirectional transmissions.  Each
   receiver acknowledges data received or, in case of packet erasures,
   asks for retransmissions.  On the opposite, the ALC protocol defines
   unidirectional transmissions.  Reliability can be achieved by means
   of cyclic transmissions of the content within a carousel, or by the
   use of proactive Forward Error Correction codes (FEC), or by the
   joint use of these mechanisms.  Being purely unidirectional, ALC is
   massively scalable, while NORM is intrinsically limited in terms of
   the number of receivers that can be handled in a session.  Both
   protocols have in common the fact that they operate at application
   level, on top of an erasure channel (e.g. the Internet) where packets
   can be lost (erased) during the transmission.

   With these CDP, an attacker might impersonate the ALC or NORM session
   sender and inject forged packets to the receivers, thereby corrupting
   the objects reconstructed by the receivers.  An attacker might also
   impersonate a NORM session receiver and inject forged feedback
   packets to the NORM sender.

   In case of group communications, several solutions exist to provide
   the receiver some guaranties on the integrity of the packets it
   receives and on the identity of the sender of these packets.  These
   solutions have different features that make them more or less suited
   to a given use case:

   o  digital signatures [RFC4359]: this scheme is well suited to low
      data rate flows, when a true packet sender authentication and
      packet integrity service is needed.  However, digital signatures
      based on RSA asymmetric cryptography is limited by high
      computational costs and high transmission overheads.  The use of
      ECC ("Elliptic Curve Cryptography") significantly relaxes these
      constraints, especially when seeking for higher security levels.
      For instance, the following key sizes provide equivalent security:
      1024 bit RSA key versus 160 bit ECC key, or 2048 bit RSA key
      versus 224 bit ECC key.

   o  group Message Authentication Codes (MAC): this scheme is well
      suited to high data rate flows, when transmission overheads must
      be minimized.  However this scheme cannot protect against attacks

      coming from inside the group, where a group member impersonates
      the sender and sends forged messages to other receivers.

   o  TESLA (Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication)
      [RFC4082][RFC5776]: this scheme is well suited to high data rate
      flows, when transmission overheads must be minimized, and when a
      true packet sender authentication and packet integrity service is
      needed.  The price to pay is an increased complexity, in
      particular the need to loosely synchronize the receivers and the
      sender, as well as the need to wait for the key to be disclosed
      before being able to authenticate a packet.

   The following table summarizes the pros/cons of each authentication/
   integrity scheme used at application/transport level (where "-" means
   bad, "0" means neutral, and "+" means good):

   +----------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+-------+

   Several authentication schemes MAY be used in the same ALC or NORM
   session, even on the same communication path.  Since all the above
   schemes make use of the same authentication header extension
   mechanism (Section 2.3, Section 4.3, Section 5.3) and [RFC5776],
   section 5.1), the same 4-bit "ASID" (Authentication Scheme
   IDentifier) has been reserved in all the specifications.  The
   association between the "ASID" value and the actual authentication
   scheme is defined at session startup and communicated to all the
   group members by an out-of-band mechanism.

1.1.  Scope of this Document

   [RFC5776] explains how to use TESLA in the context of ALC and NORM
   protocols.

   The current document specifies the use of the Digital Signature based
   on RSA asymmetric cryptography, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
   Algorithm (ECDSA) and Group MAC schemes.  The current document also
   specifies the joint use of Digital Signature and Group MAC schemes
   which is useful to mitigate DoS attacks coming from attackers that
   are not group members.

   Unlike the TESLA scheme, this specification considers the
   authentication/integrity of the packets generated by the session's
   sender as well as those generated by the receivers (NORM).

   All the applications build on top of ALC and NORM directly benefit
   from the source authentication and packet integrity services defined
   in this document.  For instance this is the case of the FLUTE
   application [RMT-FLUTE] built on top of ALC.

   The current specification assumes that several parameters (like
   keying material) are communicated out-of-band, sometimes securely,
   between the sender and the receivers.  This is detailed in
   Section 2.2 and Section 4.2.

1.2.  Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.3.  Terminology and Notations

   The following notations and definitions are used throughout this
   document:

   o  MAC is the Message Authentication Code;

   o  HMAC is the Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code;

   o  sender denotes the sender of a packet that needs the
      authentication/integrity check service.  It can be an ALC or NORM
      session sender, or a NORM session receiver in case of feedback
      traffic;

   o  receiver denotes the receiver of a packet that needs the
      authentication/integrity check service.  It can be an ALC or NORM
      session receiver, or a NORM session sender in case of feedback
      traffic;

   o  K_g is a shared group key used by the senders and the receivers.
      This key MUST be communicated to all group members,
      confidentially, before starting the session;

   o  n_k is the group key length, in bits;

   o  n_m is the length of the truncated output of the MAC [RFC2104].
      Only the n_m left-most bits (most significant bits) of the MAC
      output are kept;

2.  RSA Digital Signature Scheme

2.1.  Principles

   The computation of the digital signature, using K_priv, MUST include
   the ALC or NORM header (with the various header extensions) and the
   payload when applicable.  The UDP/IP/MAC headers MUST NOT be
   included.  During this computation, the "Signature" field MUST be set
   to 0.

   Upon receiving this packet, the receiver recomputes the Group MAC,
   using K_pub, and compares it to the value carried in the packet.
   During this computation, the Weak Group MAC field MUST also be set to
   0.  If the check fails, the packet MUST be immediately dropped.

   Several "Signature Encoding Algorithms" can be used, including
   RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 and RSASSA-PSS.  With these encodings, several
   "Signature Cryptographic Function" can be used, like SHA-256.

   First, let us consider a packet sender.  More specifically, from
   [RFC4359]: digital signature generation is performed as described in
   [RFC3447], Section 8.2.1 for RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 and Section 8.1.1 for
   RSASSA-PSS.  The authenticated portion of the packet is used as the
   message M, which is passed to the signature generation function.  The
   signer's RSA private key is passed as K. In summary (when SHA-256 is
   used), the signature generation process computes a SHA-256 hash of
   the authenticated packet bytes, signs the SHA-256 hash using the
   private key, and encodes the result with the specified RSA encoding
   type.  This process results in a value S, which is the digital
   signature to be included in the packet.

   With RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 and RSASSA-PSS signatures, the size of the
   signature is equal to the "RSA modulus", unless the "RSA modulus" is
   not a multiple of 8 bits.  In that case, the signature MUST be
   prepended with between 1 and 7 bits set to zero such that the
   signature is a multiple of 8 bits [RFC4359].  The key size, which in
   practice is also equal to the "RSA modulus", has major security
   implications.  [RFC4359] explains how to choose this value depending
   on the maximum expected lifetime of the session.  This choice is out
   of the scope of this document.

   Now let us consider a receiver.  From [RFC4359]: Digital signature
   verification is performed as described in [RFC3447], Section 8.2.2
   (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5) and [RFC3447], Section 8.1.2 (RSASSA-PSS).  Upon
   receipt, the digital signature is passed to the verification function
   as S. The authenticated portion of the packet is used as the message
   M, and the RSA public key is passed as (n, e).  In summary (when SHA-
   256 is used), the verification function computes a SHA-256 hash of

   the authenticated packet bytes, decrypts the SHA-256 hash in the
   packet using the sender's public key, and validates that the
   appropriate encoding was applied.  The two SHA-256 hashes are
   compared and if they are identical the validation is successful.

2.2.  Parameters

   Several parameters MUST be initialized by an out-of-band mechanism.
   The sender or group controller:

   o  MUST communicate his public key, for each receiver to be able to
      verify the signature of the packets received.  As a side effect,
      the receivers also know the key length, n_k, and the signature
      length, the two parameters being equal;

   o  MAY communicate a certificate (which also means that a PKI has
      been setup), for each receiver to be able to check the sender's
      public key;

   o  MUST communicate the Signature Encoding Algorithm.  For instance,
      [RFC3447] defines the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 and RSASSA-PSS algorithms
      that are usually used to that purpose;

   o  MUST communicate the Signature Cryptographic Function, for
      instance SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512.  Because of
      security threats on SHA-1, the use of SHA-256 is RECOMMENDED;

   o  MUST associate a value to the "ASID" field (Authentication Scheme
      Identifier) of the EXT_AUTH header extension (Section 2.3);

   These parameters MUST be communicated to all receivers before they
   can authenticate the incoming packets.  For instance it can be
   communicated in the session description, or initialized in a static
   way on the receivers, or communicated by means of an appropriate
   protocol.  The details of this out-of-band mechanism are out of the
   scope of this document.

2.3.  Authentication Header Extension Format

   The integration of Digital Signatures is similar in ALC and NORM and
   relies on the header extension mechanism defined in both protocols.
   More precisely this document details the EXT_AUTH==1 header extension
   defined in [RFC5651].

   Several fields are added in addition to the HET (Header Extension
   Type) and HEL (Header Extension Length) fields (Figure 1).

   Figure 1: Format of the Digital Signature EXT_AUTH header extension.

   The fields of the Digital Signature EXT_AUTH header extension are:

   "ASID" (Authentication Scheme Identifier) field (4 bits):

      The "ASID" identifies the source authentication scheme or protocol
      in use.  The association between the "ASID" value and the actual
      authentication scheme is defined out-of-band, at session startup.

   "Reserved" field (12 bits):

      This is a reserved field that MUST be set to zero in this
      specification.

   "Signature" field (variable size, multiple of 32 bits):

      The "Signature" field contains a digital signature of the message.
      If need be, this field is padded (with 0) up to a multiple of 32
      bits.

2.4.  In Practice

   Each packet sent MUST contain exactly one Digital Signature EXT_AUTH
   header extension.  A receiver MUST drop all the packets that do not

   All receivers MUST recognize EXT_AUTH but MAY not be able to parse
   its content, for instance because they do not support digital
   signatures.  In that case the Digital Signature EXT_AUTH header
   extension is ignored.

3.  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Scheme

3.1.  Principles

   The computation of the ECC digital signature, using K_priv, MUST
   include the ALC or NORM header (with the various header extensions)
   and the payload when applicable.  The UDP/IP/MAC headers MUST NOT be
   included.  During this computation, the "Signature" field MUST be set
   to 0.

   Upon receiving this packet, the receiver recomputes the Group MAC,
   using K_pub, and compares it to the value carried in the packet.
   During this computation, the Weak Group MAC field MUST also be set to
   0.  If the check fails, the packet MUST be immediately dropped.

   Several "Elliptic Curves" groups can be used, as well as several
   "Hash Algorithms".  In practice both choices are related and there is
   a minimum hash algorithm size for any key size.  Using a larger hash
   algorithm and then truncated the output is also feasible, however it
   consumes more processing power than is necessary.  The following
   table lists the RECOMMENDED choices [RFC4754] [RFC5480].

   +-------------------------+-----------+-----------------+-----------+
   |    Digital Signature    |  Key Size |  Message Digest |  Elliptic |
   |      Algorithm name     |   (n_k)   |    Algorithm    |   Curve   |
   |        [RFC4754]        |           |                 |           |
   +-------------------------+-----------+-----------------+-----------+
   |        ECDSA-256        |    256    |     SHA-256     | secp256r1 |
   |                         |           |                 |           |

   |                         |           |                 |           |
   |        ECDSA-521        |    512    |     SHA-512     | secp521r1 |
   +-------------------------+-----------+-----------------+-----------+

   The ECDSA-256, ECDSA-384 and ECDSA-521 are designed to offer security
   comparable with AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256 respectively [RFC4754].

3.2.  Parameters

   Several parameters MUST be initialized by an out-of-band mechanism.
   The sender or group controller:

   o  MUST communicate his public key, for each receiver to be able to
      verify the signature of the packets received.  As a side effect,
      the receivers also know the key length, n_k, and the signature
      length, the two parameters being equal;

   o  MAY communicate a certificate (which also means that a PKI has
      been setup), for each receiver to be able to check the sender's
      public key;

   o  MUST communicate the Message Digest Algorithm;

   o  MUST communicate the Elliptic Curve;

   o  MUST associate a value to the "ASID" field (Authentication Scheme
      Identifier) of the EXT_AUTH header extension (Section 2.3);

   These parameters MUST be communicated to all receivers before they
   can authenticate the incoming packets.  For instance it can be
   communicated in the session description, or initialized in a static
   way on the receivers, or communicated by means of an appropriate
   protocol.  The details of this out-of-band mechanism are out of the
   scope of this document.

3.3.  Authentication Header Extension Format

   The integration of ECC Digital Signatures is similar in ALC and NORM
   and relies on the header extension mechanism defined in both
   protocols.  More precisely this document details the EXT_AUTH==1
   header extension defined in [RFC5651].

   Several fields are added in addition to the HET (Header Extension
   Type) and HEL (Header Extension Length) fields (Figure 1).

   The fields of the Digital Signature EXT_AUTH header extension are:

   "ASID" (Authentication Scheme Identifier) field (4 bits):

      The "ASID" identifies the source authentication scheme or protocol
      in use.  The association between the "ASID" value and the actual
      authentication scheme is defined out-of-band, at session startup.

   "Reserved" field (12 bits):

      This is a reserved field that MUST be set to zero in this
      specification.

   "Signature" field (variable size, multiple of 32 bits):

      The "Signature" field contains a digital signature of the message.
      If need be, this field is padded (with 0) up to a multiple of 32
      bits.

3.4.  In Practice

   Each packet sent MUST contain exactly one ECC Digital Signature
   EXT_AUTH header extension.  A receiver MUST drop all the packets that
   do not contain an ECC Digital Signature EXT_AUTH header extension.

   All receivers MUST recognize EXT_AUTH but MAY not be able to parse
   its content, for instance because they do not support ECC digital
   signatures.  In that case the Digital Signature EXT_AUTH header
   extension is ignored.

4.  Group Message Authentication Code (MAC) Scheme

4.1.  Principles

   The computation of the Group MAC, using K_g, includes the ALC or NORM
   header (with the various header extensions) and the payload when
   applicable.  The UDP/IP/MAC headers are not included.  During this
   computation, the Weak Group MAC field MUST be set to 0.  Then the
   sender truncates the MAC output to keep the n_m most significant bits
   and stores the result in the Group MAC Authentication header.

   Upon receiving this packet, the receiver recomputes the Group MAC,
   using K_g, and compares it to the value carried in the packet.
   During this computation, the Group MAC field MUST also be set to 0.
   If the check fails, the packet MUST be immediately dropped.

   [RFC2104] explains that it is current practice to truncate the MAC
   output, on condition that the truncated output length, n_m be not
   less than half the length of the hash and not less than 80 bits.
   However, this choice is out of the scope of this document.

4.2.  Parameters

   Several parameters MUST be initialized by an out-of-band mechanism.
   The sender or group controller:

   o  MUST communicate the Cryptographic MAC Function, for instance,
      HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-224, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, or HMAC-SHA-
      512.  Because of security threats on SHA-1, the use of HMAC-SHA-
      256 is RECOMMENDED.  As a side effect, the receivers also know the
      key length, n_k, and the non truncated MAC output length;

   o  MUST communicate the length of the truncated output of the MAC,
      n_m, which depends on the Cryptographic MAC Function chosen.  Only
      the n_m left-most bits (most significant bits) of the MAC output
      are kept.  Of course, n_m MUST be lower or equal to n_k;

   o  MUST communicate the K_g group key to the receivers,
      confidentially, before starting the session.  This key might have
      to be periodically refreshed for improved robustness;

   o  MUST associate a value to the "ASID" field (Authentication Scheme
      Identifier) of the EXT_AUTH header extension (Section 4.3);

   These parameters MUST be communicated to all receivers before they
   can authenticate the incoming packets.  For instance it can be
   communicated in the session description, or initialized in a static
   way on the receivers, or communicated by means of an appropriate

5.  Combined Use of the RSA/ECC Digital Signatures and Group MAC Schemes

5.1.  Principles

   In some situations, it can be interesting to use both authentication
   schemes.  The goal of the Group MAC is to mitigate DoS attacks coming
   from attackers that are not group members [RFC4082] by adding a light
   authentication scheme as a front-end.

   More specifically, before sending a message, the sender sets the
   Signature field and Group MAC field to zero.  Then the sender
   computes the Signature as detailed in Section 2.1 or in Section 3.1
   and stores the value in the Signature field.  Then the sender
   computes the Group MAC as detailed in Section 4.1 and stores the
   value in the Group MAC field.  The (RSA or ECC) digital signature
   value is therefore protected by the Group MAC, which avoids DoS
   attacks where the attacker corrupts the digital signature itself.

   Upon receiving the packet, the receiver first checks the Group MAC,
   as detailed in Section 4.1.  If the check fails, the packet MUST be
   immediately dropped.  Otherwise the receiver checks the Digital
   Signature, as detailed in Section 2.1.  If the check fails, the
   packet MUST be immediately dropped.

   This scheme features a few limits:

   o  the Group MAC is of no help if a group member (who knows K_g)
      impersonates the sender and sends forged messages to other
      receivers.  DoS attacks are still feasible;

   o  it requires an additional MAC computing for each packet, both at
      the sender and receiver sides;

   o  it increases the size of the authentication headers.  In order to
      limit this problem, the length of the truncated output of the MAC,
      n_m, SHOULD be kept small (see [RFC3711] section 9.5).  In the
      current specification, n_m MUST be a multiple of 32 bits, and
      default value is 32 bits.  As a side effect, with $n_m = 32$ bits,
      the authentication service is significantly weakened since the
      probability that any packet be successfully forged is one in 2^32.
      Since the Group MAC check is only a pre-check that is followed by
      the standard signature authentication check, this is not
      considered to be an issue.

   For a given use-case, the benefits brought by the Group MAC must be
   balanced against these limitations.

   details the EXT_AUTH==1 header extension defined in [RFC5651].

   Several fields are added in addition to the HET (Header Extension
   Type) and HEL (Header Extension Length) fields (Figure 7).

       Figure 7: Format of the Group MAC EXT_AUTH header extension.

   The fields of the Group MAC EXT_AUTH header extension are:

   "ASID" (Authentication Scheme Identifier) field (4 bits):

      The "ASID" identifies the source authentication scheme or protocol
      in use.  The association between the "ASID" value and the actual
      authentication scheme is defined out-of-band, at session startup.

   "Reserved" field (12 bits):

      This is a reserved field that MUST be set to zero in this
      specification.

   "Signature" field (variable size, multiple of 32 bits):

Internet-Draft   Simple authentication for ALC and NORM        July 2010


      The "Signature" field contains a digital signature of the message.
      If need be, this field is padded (with 0) up to a multiple of 32
      bits.

   "Group MAC" field (variable size, multiple of 32 bits, by default 32
   bits):

      The "Group MAC" field contains a truncated Group MAC of the
      message.

5.4.  In Practice

   Each packet sent MUST contain exactly one combined Digital Signature/
   Group MAC EXT_AUTH header extension.  A receiver MUST drop packets
   that do not contain a combined Digital Signature/Group MAC EXT_AUTH
   header extension.

   All receivers MUST recognize EXT_AUTH but MAY not be able to parse
   its content, for instance because they do not support combined
   Digital Signature/Group MAC.  In that case the combined Digital
   Signature/Group MAC EXT_AUTH extension is ignored.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the n_m parameter of the group authentication
   scheme be small, and by default equal to 32 bits (Section 5.1).

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Dealing With DoS Attacks

   Digital signatures introduces new opportunities for an attacker to
   mount DoS attacks.  For instance an attacker can try to saturate the
   processing capabilities of the receiver (faked packets are easy to
   create but checking them requires to compute a costly digital
   signature).

   In order to mitigate these attacks, it is RECOMMENDED to use the
   combined Digital Signature/Group MAC scheme (Section 5.1).  However,
   no mitigation is possible if a group member acts as an attacker.

7.2.  Dealing With Replay Attacks

   Replay attacks consist for an attacker to store a valid message and
   to replay it later on.

7.2.1.  Impacts of Replay Attacks on the Simple Authentication Schemes

   Since all the above authentication schemes are memoryless, replay
   attacks have no impact on these schemes.

7.2.2.  Impacts of Replay Attacks on NORM

   We review here the potential impacts of a replay attack on the NORM
   component.  Note that we do not consider here the protocols that
   could be used along with NORM, for instance the congestion control
   protocols.

   First, let us consider replay attacks within a given NORM session.
   NORM defines a "sequence" field that can be used to protect against
   replay attacks [RFC5740] within a given NORM session.  This
   "sequence" field is a 16-bit value that is set by the message
   originator (sender or receiver) as a monotonically increasing number
   incremented with each NORM message transmitted.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that a receiver check this sequence field and drop messages
   considered as replayed.  Similarly, it is RECOMMENDED that a sender
   check this sequence, for each known receiver, and drop messages
   considered as replayed.  In both cases, checking this sequence field
   SHOULD be done before authenticating the packet: if the sequence
   field has not been corrupted, the replay attack will immediately be
   identified, and otherwise the packet will fail the authentication
   test.  This analysis shows that NORM itself is robust in front of
   replay attacks within the same session.

   Now let us consider replay attacks across several NORM sessions.  A

   host participation in a NORM session is uniquely identified by the
   {"source_id"; "instance_id"} tuple.  Therefore, when a given host
   participates in several NORM sessions, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   "instance_id" be changed for each NORM instance.  It is also
   RECOMMENDED, when the Group MAC authentication/integrity check scheme
   is used, that the shared group key, K_g, be changed across sessions.
   Therefore, NORM can be made robust in front of replay attacks across
   different sessions.

7.2.3.  Impacts of Replay Attacks on ALC

   We review here the potential impacts of a replay attack on the ALC
   component.  Note that we do not consider here the protocols that
   could be used along with ALC, for instance the layered or wave based
   congestion control protocols.

   First, let us consider replay attacks within a given ALC session:

   o  Regular packets containing an authentication tag: a replayed
      message containing an encoding symbol will be detected once
      authenticated, thanks to the object/block/symbol identifiers, and
      will be silently discarded.  This kind of replay attack is only
      penalizing in terms of memory and processing load, but does not
      compromise the ALC behavior.

   o  Control packets containing an authentication tag: ALC control
      packets, by definition, do not include any encoding symbol and
      therefore do not include any object/block/symbol identifier that
      would enable a receiver to identify duplicates.  However, a sender
      has a very limited number of reasons to send control packets.
      More precisely:

      *  At the end of the session, a "close session" (A flag) packet is
         sent.  Replaying this packet has no impact since the receivers
         already left.

      *  Similarly, replaying a packet containing a "close object" (B
         flag) has no impact since this object is probably already
         marked as closed by the receiver.

   This analysis shows that ALC itself is robust in front of replay
   attacks within the same session.

   Now let us consider replay attacks across several ALC sessions.  An
   ALC session is uniquely identified by the {sender's IP address;
   Transport Session Identifier (TSI)} [RFC5651].  Therefore, when a
   given sender creates several sessions, it is RECOMMENDED that the TSI
   be changed for each ALC instance.  It is also RECOMMENDED, when the

   Group MAC authentication/integrity check scheme is used, that the
   shared group key, K_g, be changed across sessions.  Therefore, ALC
   can be made robust in front of replay attacks across different
   sessions.
