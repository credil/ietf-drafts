Abstract

   Implementing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) advanced features and
   services requires to use numerous specifications.  Today, for each
   service in the scope of BLISS, one can already find references to
   many possible specifications which do not cover the same things.
   Some of them are primitive operations, requirements or call flow
   examples, some have a scope larger than the others, or can not be
   compared at the same level.  Very often, architecture hypothesis are
   hidden behind the same service name, either assuming that an
   intermediary; like an application server, has an active role in the
   service, or, as opposed, assuming a pure end-to-end model where only
   endpoint implementations are involved.  The goal of this document is
   not to present the best solutions or give recommendations; but to
   give an overview of every standard specification related to these
   services, centralizing and categorizing them as input to the working
   group.

Internet-Draft             SIP Services Guide              February 2008


1.  Introduction, scope

   BLISS working group is chartered to facilitate effective feature
   interoperability for advanced services sharing common functional
   primitives utilizing SIP.  In particular, it focuses on advanced call
   features requiring non-trivial call control.  The objective of this
   document is not to give recommendation or to give a technical
   appreciation of referenced specifications.  So, references that could
   be found in this document SHOULD NOT be considered as the recommended
   way of implementing any service.  This document aims at providing the
   current "snapshot" of "SIP services" specifications, centralizing
   what currently exist.

   This first version presented here shows that the number of
   specifications around call features is quite impressive, sometimes
   individual drafts have addressed a very specific problem that has
   been forgotten in the Internet draft morgue.  Some other
   specifications like ISDN ones have to be considered from a different
   point of view: they are most of the time referencing existing IETF
   specifications when they exist, generally trying to additionally
   standardize the format of a user profile which contains the
   configuration elements of the service.  This approach assumes that
   there is a user profile database, operated somewhere, which is of
   course out of IETF scope.  In that case, goal is indeed not to give
   any appreciation on these external specifications, but to describe
   which differences may exist between them, and if they diverge, try to
   explain why.  Thus, this document categorizes them in order to
   outline what is currently missing and which documents can be compared
   at the same "level".  Indeed, very often, the confusion around
   service specifications arises when this it not clear if it can be
   assumed that an 'active intermediary' (a proxy, B2BUA, application
   server....) contributes to the service implementation or not.
   Difficulty is increased by the fact architecture considerations are
   clearly out of IETF scope, but still need to be taken into account
   when providing recommendations.  This document clarifies this
   situation each time it is possible, outlining if the referenced
   specifications assume a "pure end-to-end" or an "intermediary" model.
   For that purpose it separates the call flows in two sub-sections
   called "Endpoint based" or "Intermediary based".  This is of course a
   simplification of the architecture alternatives, but it appears to be
   enough to clarify the discussion.

   Today, service categories that are considered as in-scope of BLISS
   are the following:

   o  Call forwarding

Internet-Draft             SIP Services Guide              February 2008


   o  Call Transfer

   o  Hold

   o  Call Baring

   o  Conference

   o  Call parking

   o  Do not disturb

   o  Call completion

   This list will be the starting point of this guide, it MAY be
   extended to other topics in the future if it is considered as useful.
   For each of these services, it provides:

   o  first, a short description of the service;

   o  second, user's requirements or frameworks which give grounds of
      any implementation;

   o  third, references to documents that contain call flows showing the
      application of the service;

   o  inally, a short description of any specification that has been
      identified (possibly erroneously) as useful to implement a
      service, giving some "hints" on why it is referenced in this
      context

   While the first version of this document was only list of references
   from IETF and TISPAN with some comments, this second version add
   references from ETSI ISDN.  As shown below, these specifications
   contain interesting non-technical descriptions of some services.
   Furthermore in this version, a particular attention has been given to
   the 'Call flow samples' section: each sample is described with more
   details, including a list of optional and mandatory dependencies.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Call Forwarding

3.1.  Description

   Call forwarding allows users to divert a call from its destination
   without answering it.  There are a few cases of call forwarding.  For
   example, users should be able to forward calls towards another person
   when he is already on the phone, when he does not answer or when he
   is unavailable.  Call forwarding should also allow users to setup
   unconditional forwarding based on a set of rules.  Call forwarding
   always occur before the establishment of the call (see Call
   Transfer).

   'Call Forwarding' (CFx) is also called 'Call diversion' (CDIV).

3.2.  Frameworks and requirements

   o  EN 300 199 [EN300199], from ISDN specification describes the
      service of call forwarding on Busy.  It gives requirements of
      users and defines common terms related to this kind of service.
      EN 300 133 [EN301133], coming from ISDN specifications, gives more
      general specifications of call forwarding and provides
      requirements, terminology and definitions.

3.3.  Call flow samples

3.3.1.  Endpoint based Call Forwarding

   o  DESCRIPTION: endpoints can also implement call forwarding.  No
      specification example of this solution has been found.

   o  MANDATORY: no mandatory specification found for this service.

   o  OPTIONAL: terminals that implements this kind of forwarding could
      base their implementation on LESS [I-D.wu-iptel-less]

3.3.2.  Intermediary based Call Forwarding

   o  DESCRIPTION: sections 7,8,9 of [I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples]
      present some cases of call forwarding.  These call flows are
      mainly implementation dependent.  TS 183 004 [TS183004], from
      TISPAN, uses call flows like those from sipping-service-examples.
      It just additionally defines the user profile data model related
      to this service.  The same technique of call forwarding is also
      described into section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-bliss-problem-statement].

   o  MANDATORY: none




Ligot & Froment          Expires August 28, 2008                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             SIP Services Guide              February 2008


   o  OPTIONAL: RFC 3880 (CPL) [RFC3880] or TISPAN profile defined into
      TS 183 004 [TS183004] can be used by the user to tell the
      configuration to the server.  RFC 4458 (URI for applications)
      [RFC4458] and RFC 4244 (history-info) [RFC4244] can be used to add
      information about the diversion inside the SIP dialog

3.4.  Specifications

   o  RFC 4458 (URI for applications) [RFC4458] specifies two new
      parameters for the contact field that could be added when a call
      is forwarded.  These parameters are 'cause' and 'target': they
      allow voicemails, for instance, to send an adapted greeting to the
      caller who has been transferred.

   o  RFC 4244 (history-info) [RFC4244] introduces a new optional
      header: 'history-info' which contains the list of previous target
      URIs of the call and could contain additional values such as the
      cause of each call forwarding, levels of privacy, etc.

   o  TS 183 004 [TS183004] from TISPAN present a solution based on a
      centralized server.  This specification even specifies a way for
      the user to send the expected configuration to the server.

   o  RFC 3880 (CPL) [RFC3880], CPL, presents a XML based script
      language which can be used by end users in order to upload rules
      of call forwarding to their proxy.  The proxy should interpret
      this set of rules and apply them without any action from the
      endpoint.

   o  Like CPL, LESS [I-D.wu-iptel-less] is a language that could be
      used to configure call forwarding but on the end point side.

   o  RFC 3841 [RFC3841] could be used to register fall back destination
      for a user.  While this specification can be use in order to
      implement a particular kind of call forwarding, this is not the
      primary goal of this specification.  However, this specification
      could be useful to allow a caller, in particular conditions, to
      bypass or cancel a call forwarding.  For instance, the
      specification shows an example where the caller refuses to be
      transferred to a voicemail; in that case, appropriate error
      messages are sent.

   o  As call forwarding often comes with privacy requirements, RFC 3323
      [RFC3323] could be helpful but it also introduces some
      requirements over the network infrastructure since it assumes a
      privacy server is deployed somewhere.

4.  Call Transfer

4.1.  Description

   Call transfer occurs when a communication is already established
   between parties and one of them, the transferor, wants to transfer
   the other party, the transferee, to another party, the target, which
   is not already a member of the on going dialog.

   Requirements for this services often include privacy and
   authentication.  The target of a transfer could also be a service, a
   conference room, or something else...

   Transfer could be "managed".  In this case, the transferor invites
   the target, establishes a communication with it while the other party
   is usually on hold and then ends its communication with it.  Finally,
   it transfers the transferee to the target.

4.2.  Frameworks and requirements

   o  Section 4 of cc-transfer [I-D.ietf-sipping-cc-transfer] gives the
      requirements of such service.

   o  EN 300 367 [EN300367], from ISDN specifications, like the previous
      one gives a complete description of the service including user's
      requirements.

4.3.  Call flow samples

4.3.1.  Using REFER from the transferor to the transferee

   o  DESCRIPTION: Sections 4 and 5 of service-examples
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples] show some basic call flows of
      transfer using a REFER message sent by the transferor, the user
      who wants to transfer the other party in the current dialog.  This
      solution is also used in draft-ietf-sipping-cc-transfer
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-cc-transfer] for instance, in section 6.

   o  MANDATORY: Both parties MUST support RFC 3515 (REFER) [RFC3515].
      This also implies the support of RFC 3265 (Event notifications)
      [RFC3265]

   o  OPTIONAL: RFC 3892 ('Referred-by') [RFC3892]

Internet-Draft             SIP Services Guide              February 2008


4.3.2.  Using REFER from the transferor to the target

   o  DESCRIPTION: draft-ietf-sipping-cc-transfer, section 7.2
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-cc-transfer].  This solution, unlike the
      previous one, allows the transferor to hide the sip URI of the
      target to the transferee.  This solution is also referenced by TS
      183 029 [TS183029]

   o  MANDATORY: The transferor and the target MUST support RFC 3515
      (REFER) [RFC3515] and RFC 3265 (Event notifications) [RFC3265].

   o  OPTIONAL: RFC 3891 ('Replace' header) [RFC3891] and RFC 4538
      (tdialog) [RFC4538] MAY also be supported by the transferor and
      the transferee.

4.3.3.  Using MESSAGE

   o  DESCRIPTION: This particular transfer is only presented into
      Section 6 of service-examples [I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples].
      Instead of using REFER, this solution proposes that the transferor
      sends a MESSAGE message to the target or the transferee with the
      URI of the other party.  This solution implicitly relies on an
      action done by the end user.

   o  MANDATORY: none

   o  OPTIONAL: none

4.4.  Specifications

   o  RFC 3515 (REFER) [RFC3515] specifies the REFER method which allows
      a terminal to ask another terminal to send another SIP request.
      This is the most commonly used method for doing transfer.

   o  When the target receives the REFER request, it sends, in most
      cases, an INVITE to the transferee.  This INVITE carries
      information about the call which is replaced using RFC 3891
      ('Replace' header) [RFC3891] and RFC 4538 (tdialog) [RFC4538].
      Thanks to this information, the transferee SHOULD accept this
      INVITE without sending an error '486 Busy Here'.  RFC 3892
      ('Referred-by') [RFC3892] lets it knows who sent the REFER.  RFC
      3893 (Authenticated Identity Body) [RFC3893] allows to sign this
      information.

   o  REFER implies an event package, RFC 3265 (Event notifications)
      [RFC3265], that can be suppressed using RFC 4488 (Suppression of
      events related to REFER) [RFC4488].  This event package allows the
      transferor to get information about the status of the transfer.

Internet-Draft             SIP Services Guide              February 2008


      INVITE usage also implies to support events as specified in RFC
      4235 (Event package for INVITE) [RFC4235].

   o  In order to prevent the INVITE generated by the REFER to reach all
      terminals of the transferee, GRUU [I-D.ietf-sip-gruu] allows to
      get a unique address to the user agent concerned by the new
      INVITE.

   o  Presence [RFC3856] could be a source of information about the
      status of one user which can help application to define next
      target of a call.

   o  Users may desire to initiate a transfer which is not managed by
      their terminal.  In this case RFC 4730 [RFC4730] allows
      intermediaries to receive events from the keypad of the user's
      terminal.

   o  Like with RFC 3840 [RFC3840] and RFC 3841 [RFC3841], capabilities
      of the target could be received by the transferor using RFC 4508
      [RFC4508].

   o  Privacy [RFC3323] is also a basic requirement for this service.

5.  Hold

5.1.  Description

   It is often useful to prevent the other party from listening to the
   conversation for a short period.  Instead of hearing the other party,
   the party on hold could hear a music.  Moreover, the terminal on hold
   SHOULD know it is on hold in order to give a correct feedback to the
   user.

5.2.  Frameworks and requirements

   Besides ISDN specifications where there is a very short description
   of this service, nothing has been found.  However requirements for
   this service are very basic.  The user on Hold just wants to prevent
   other users from hearing him.

5.3.  Call flow samples

5.3.1.  Using (re-)INVITE with SDP 'send-only' parameter

   o  DESCRIPTION: In this solution a renegotiation of the media is done
      using SDP protocol.  It establishes a new mono directional
      communication in order to replace the first bi-directional
      communication.  This solution is presented into sections 1, 2 and
      3 of service-examples [I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples] and
      TS183 010 [TS183010]

   o  MANDATORY: none

   o  OPTIONAL: RFC 3725 (3PCC) [RFC3725] could be supported by the
      party which wants to put the other one on hold.

5.4.  Specifications

   o  RFC 3725 (3PCC) [RFC3725], is referenced in previous documents to
      force the other party to listen to music.  In that case, the party
      on hold will generate a third party call between the caller and a
      media server.

   o  If some music has to be sent from a server, a media server may be
      involved, this is partially defined into RFC4240 (Media Services)
      [RFC4240].

6.  Call Baring

6.1.  Description

   Users SHOULD be able to block, or make any preventive action on
   unsolicited calls based on a set of rules.  This service could be
   executed either on the endpoint or on an intermediary server.
   Service provider could also be interested in setting a set of rules
   on top of users ones.

6.2.  Frameworks and requirements

   o  draft-froment-sipping-spit-requirements
      [I-D.froment-sipping-spit-requirements].  This document defines a
      set of requirements to define policies allowing to make any kind
      of reactive actions to prevent SPIT.

   o  draft-tschofenig-sipping-framework-spit-reduction
      [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-framework-spit-reduction].  This document
      describes a framework for the usage of SPIT policies.

   o  EN 301 768 [EN301768] from ISDN specifications gives user's
      requirements for this service.

6.3.  Call flow samples

6.3.1.  Intermediary based call baring

   o  DESCRIPTION: This solution allows a proxy to reject a call before
      this call actually reaches the end user.  This is the most
      efficient way to prevent undesirable calls such as SPIT.

   o  MANDATORY: none

   o  OPTIONAL: The callee could consider configuring an intermediary,
      for instance using: spit-policy
      [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-spit-policy], or CPL [RFC3880], etc.

6.3.2.  Endpoint based call baring

   o  DESCRIPTION: This solution is not incompatible with the previous
      one.  In that case, the endpoint decides to reject the call using
      4xx error messages.

   o  MANDATORY: none

   o  OPTIONAL: LESS [I-D.wu-iptel-less] could be a standardized way for
      implementing this service.

6.4.  Specifications

   o  spit-policy [I-D.tschofenig-sipping-spit-policy].  This is a
      policy document format specification proposal for the requirements
      defined in draft-froment-sipping-spit-requirements
      [I-D.froment-sipping-spit-requirements].  This can be used to
      implement Call barring, but scope is larger since it can be used
      to make white or black lists, or to have different reactive
      actions (block, polite block, ask for a Turing test, ask for
      consent, send an email...), depending on the policies.

   o  acr-code [I-D.ietf-sip-acr-code] defines criteria which can be
      used to reject calls: Privacy [RFC3323], using P-Asserted-Identity
      header [RFC3325] or by reading the content of From header.  RFC
      5079 (Error 433) [RFC5079] defines an error message '433 Anonymity
      Disallowed'.

   o  TS 183 011 [TS183011] defines the service data model to be put on
      an application server and introduces a set of rules, based on
      Initial Filter Criterias (IFC) specified into TS 183 033
      [TS183033].

   o  CPL [RFC3880] and LESS [I-D.wu-iptel-less] allow users to write
      down a set of rules, those are stored on a server for the first
      one, and in user's terminal for the second one.

7.  Conference

7.1.  Description

   Conference allows more than two peoples to speak together.  It may
   also provide users with some features like allowing to invite
   somebody inside the conference or moderate the room, ...  Most of
   these requirements are very well defined into RFC 4245 [RFC4245]

7.2.  Frameworks and requirements

   o  RFC 4245 (Conferencing Requirements) [RFC4245] only defines which
      conferencing requirements are expected from users.

   o  RFC 4353 (Conferencing Framework) [RFC4353] does not specify any
      service but terms, roles, actions of each participant, user or
      software.

   o  RFC 4597 (Conferencing Scenarios) [RFC4597] presents some
      scenarios of conferences which could lead to some problems unless
      followed carefully.

7.3.  Call flow samples

   o  DESCRIPTION: sections 10 and 11 of service-examples
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples] show some very basics call
      flows of conferencing.

   o  MANDATORY: nothing is required for terminals that only want to
      join a conference room.

   o  OPTIONAL: RFC 4575 (Conference Package) [RFC4575], RFC 4579
      (Conferencing for User Agent) [RFC4579] could be useful for a
      terminal willing to control the conference room.

7.4.  Specifications

   o  RFC 4575 (Conference Package) [RFC4575] allows users to get
      information over the current room by defining an event package.
      When a user joins a room, he could, for example, subscribe to this
      event package and receive notifications when somebody else joins
      this room.  uri-list-conferencing
      [I-D.ietf-sip-uri-list-conferencing] gives another way to publish
      his URI while joining the conference and allows other users to
      retrieve the list of members of the current room.  conference-
      list-event [I-D.koren-sipping-conference-list-event] presents
      another list of events related to conferences.

Internet-Draft             SIP Services Guide              February 2008


   o  RFC 4579 (Conferencing for User Agent) [RFC4579] explains how to
      add or remove somebody from a conference room by using REFER/
      INVITE or REFER/BYE.  It also explains how to create a conference
      room using an INVITE and how headers like Join [RFC3911] or
      Replace [RFC3891] SHOULD be used.  This document also presents
      features allowing users to change their User Agents without
      leaving the room or allowing users to convert simple dialog with
      two parties into a conference.  As adding somebody inside a
      conference is basically a transfer, there is more documentation of
      this in the "Transfer" section above.

   o  While members of a room MAY NOT have the same capabilities
      depending on their user agent, conference server may need to
      perform some transcoding.  This is specified into:transc-conf
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-transc-conf] and
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-transc-framework].

   o  TS 183 005 [TS183005] from TISPAN uses specifications from IETF.
      This document does not include any reference to RFC 4575
      (Conference Package) [RFC4575]

   o  RFC 4240 (Media Services) [RFC4240] defines media servers and how
      they can be used for making announcements.  RFC 5022 (MSCML)
      [RFC5022] explains how to control them.

   o  Even if RFC 3550 (RTP) [RFC3550] is not directly related to SIP,
      it specifies how RTP streams could be mixed.

   o  adhoc-conferencing [I-D.camarillo-sipping-adhoc-conferencing]
      gives specifications for using servers in ad-hoc mode.

8.  Call parking

8.1.  Description

   Call parking allows users to put a call on hold, hang up their
   terminal and retrieve the call from this terminal or from another
   terminal using a unique URI.

8.2.  Frameworks and requirements

   None found

8.3.  Call flow samples

   o  sections 15 and 16 of service-examples
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-service-examples] show some very basic call
      flows of conferencing.

8.4.  Specifications

   o  A first specification of call parking could be found into:
      draft-procter-bliss-call-park-extension
      [I-D.procter-bliss-call-park-extension].

   o  Call parking could be considered as equivalent to two transfers to
      a specific type of conference room.  In that case, specifications
      described above could be reused.

   o  The call which is parked could be considered as 'on hold'.

9.  Do not disturb

9.1.  Description

   This service should allow users to prevent temporary calls from one
   or all users from disturbing him.  This means he does not want INVITE
   messages matching per-defined rules to make his terminal ring because
   he will not answer.

   There is, at the present time, no particular specification. (other
   than sending an error message from RFC 3261 [RFC3261], for example,
   to the caller).  However a draft: draft-elwell-bliss-dnd-00
   [I-D.elwell-bliss-dnd] provides an analysis of the current situation.

9.2.  Frameworks and requirements

   None found

9.3.  Call flow samples

10.  Call Completion

10.1.  Description

   o  This service enables the caller to establish a communication with
      the callee even if at the time of the communication initiation,
      the callee is not able to answer the call (busy, not available,
      ...) without having to restart a new communication.

10.2.  Frameworks and requirements

   o  EN 301 134 [EN301134] describes these services from the end user
      side.  This document describes only the case where the user, in
      switched circuit environment has no free channel available to
      receive the current call.  In a SIP environment, this can be
      compared with the error '486 Busy Here'.

10.3.  Call flow samples

   None found

10.4.  Specifications

   ietf-bliss-call-completion [I-D.ietf-bliss-call-completion] proposes
   a specification where the service is implemented thanks to a new
   event package.

11.  Conclusion

   This version shows that specifications are actually numerous.  It
   also shows that there is a lack of framework and requirements.
   Information is difficult to find, and is sometimes hidden in
   individual contributions which are not always understood by non-IETF
   people as "unofficial".  It MAY partially explain why SIP services
   implementers are not always satisfied and it clearly does not help
   interoperability.  That's why this document was created.  Some
   external references, like the ISDN specifications, have a different
   objective and are difficult to compare since they take some
   assumptions on the network architecture.  Proposal of this document
   on this problem is to split the problem in two parts: the pure-
   endpoint based architectures, and the others based on an
   intermediary.

   We do believe that all these specifications are a good illustration
   of "what is done elsewhere", and that it may be taken as input for
   building BLISS recommendations.
