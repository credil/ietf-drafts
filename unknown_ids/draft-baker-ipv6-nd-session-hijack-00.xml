      <t>Host 1 properly allocates an address by whatever means including
      manual configuration, DHCPv6, SeND, or ND, and uses the address to open
      a session with Host 2. The fact that it has allocated the address is
      observed by Host 3, perhaps by receipt of a Neighbor Solicitation during
      Duplicate Address Detection.</t>
      <t>Host 1 now experiences a link-down event, losing the use of the
      address. This might be because the switch rebooted, Host 1's
      connectivity to the LAN was temporarily lost, or because Host 1 itself
      failed.</t>
      <t>Host 3 now issues a Neighbor Solicitation for Host 1's address, and
      because Host 1 has lost its memory of the address or is unavailable at
      the time the request goes out. It has therefore correctly allocated the
      address to itself.</t>
      <t>In this case, it would appear that the session between Host 1 and
      Host 2 is transferred, so that it is now between Host 2 and Host 3.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="mitigations" title="Possible mitigations">
      <t>First one should note that in a cloud computing environment this may
      be an intended behavior. If it is unintended, it constitutes an
      attack.</t>
      <t>There are a number of possible mitigations: <list style="symbols">
          <t>Obviously, if the hosts have any form of session security
          including IPsec AH, IPsec ESP, TLS, etc, the applications will be
          prevented from communicating. Host 3 will still, however, be aware
          that the sessions existed.</t>
          <t>Neighbor Discovery could be augmented to prevent movement of the
          IPv6 address from one MAC Address to another without an
          application-obvious hiccup.</t>
          <t>If a SAVI switch is in use, the SAVI behavior could similarly be
          extended to prevent the movement of the address from Host 1 to Host
          3 without an application-obvious hiccup.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This memo asks the IANA for no new parameters.</t>
      <t>Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
      correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are required,
      or if those assignments or registries are created during the RFC
      publication process. From the author"s perspective, it may therefore be
      removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor"s discretion.</t>
