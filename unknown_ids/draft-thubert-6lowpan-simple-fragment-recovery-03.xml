	  <t>
 	    Considering that 6LoWPAN packets can be as large as 2K bytes and that
	    a 802.15.4 frame with security will carry in the order of 80 bytes of effective payload,
	    a packet might be fragmented into about 25 fragments at the 6LoWPAN shim layer.
		This level of fragmentation is much higher than that traditionally experienced over the 
		Internet with IPv4 fragments.
	    At the same time, the use of radios increases the probability of transmission loss
        and	Mesh-Under techniques compound that risk over multiple hops. 
		<!--n the other hand, Layer
		2 retries alleviate the risk of packet loss but lead to less controlled overall latency, 
		monopolize a hop, and might not be as efficient as trying an alternate path entirely.
		--> 
		
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  	<!--
		Lessons about fragmentation were learnt with IPv4 that lead to <xref target="RFC1191"> the
		Path MTU discovery</xref>. 
		-->
		Past experience with fragmentation has shown that
		missassociated or lost fragments can lead to poor network behaviour and,
		eventually, trouble at application layer. The reader is encouraged to read
		<xref target="RFC4963"/> and follow the references for more information. 
		That experience led to the definition of <xref target="RFC1191"> the
		Path MTU discovery</xref> protocol that limits fragmentation over the Internet. 
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  	<!--
		Because higher QoS packets might require access to the medium, or because an alternate path
		might be globally more efficient over the LoWPAN at a given point of time, 
		--> 
		An end-to-end fragment recovery mechanism might be a good complement to a 
		hop-by-hop MAC level recovery with a limited number of retries.
	    This draft introduces a simple protocol to recover individual fragments between 6LoWPAN endpoints.

	<section anchor='rationale' title="Rationale">
	  <t>

	  There are a number of usages for large packets in Wireless Sensor Networks. Such usages
	  may not be the most typical or represent the largest amount of traffic over the LoWPAN;
	  however, the associated functionality can be critical enough to justify extra care for 
	  ensuring effective transport of large packets across the LoWPAN.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>
	  The list of those usages includes:
          <list style='hanging'>
		  
	     <t hangText="Towards the LoWPAN node:">
		 
          <list style='hanging'>
		  
	      <t hangText="Packages of Commands:">
	       A number of commands or a full configuration can by packaged as a single message
	       to ensure consistency and enable atomic execution or complete roll back. 
		   Until such commands are fully received and interpreted, the intended operation will not take effect.
	     </t>
	     <t hangText="Firmware update:">
	       For example, a new version of the LoWPAN node software is downloaded from a system
		   manager over unicast or multicast services.
		   Such a reflashing operation typically involves updating a large number of similar
		   6LoWPAN nodes over a relatively short period of time.

	     <t hangText="From the LoWPAN node:">

		</list>
	  </t>
	  <t>
		   Uncontrolled firmware download or waveform upload can easily result in a massive 
		   increase of the traffic and saturate the network. 
		</t>
		<t>
		   When a fragment is lost in transmission, all fragments are resent, further contributing
	       to the congestion that caused the initial loss, and potentially leading to congestion collapse.
		   
	  </t>
	  <t>
		   This saturation may lead to excessive radio interference, or random early discard 
		   (leaky bucket) in relaying nodes. Additional queueing and memory congestion may
		   result while waiting for a low power next hop to emerge from its sleeping state.

	</section>
	<section anchor='req' title="Requirements">

	   <t>
	      This paper proposes a method to recover individual fragments between LoWPAN endpoints. The
		  method is designed to fit the following requirements of a LoWPAN (with or without a Mesh-Under 
		  routing protocol):
		  
	   <list style="hanging">
	   <t hangText="Number of fragments"></t>
	   
	   <t>The recovery mechanism must support highly fragmented packets, with a maximum of 32 fragments per packet.
	   </t>
	   <t hangText="Minimum acknowledgement overhead"></t>  
	   <t> Because the radio is half duplex, and because of silent time spent in the 
	   various medium access mechanisms, an acknowledgement consumes roughly as many resources as data fragment.  
	    </t><t>The recovery mechanism should be able to acknowledge multiple fragments in a single message.
		</t>
           
	   <t hangText="Controlled latency"></t>
	   
	   <t>The recovery mechanism must succeed or give up within the time boundary imposed by the recovery process 
	   of the Upper Layer Protocols. 
	   </t>
	   <t hangText="Support for out-of-order fragment delivery"></t>  
	   <t> A Mesh-Under load balancing mechanism such as the ISA100 Data Link Layer can introduce out-of-sequence packets.
	   The recovery mechanism must account for packets that appear lost but are actually only delayed over a different path.
	    </t>
           
	   <t hangText="Optional congestion control"></t>  
	   <t> The aggregation of multiple concurrent flows may lead to the saturation of the radio network and congestion collapse.
		</t>
		<t>The recovery mechanism should provide means for controlling the number of fragments in transit over the LoWPAN.
	    </t>
	   <t hangText="Backward compatibility"></t>  
	   <t> A node that implements this draft should be able to communicate with a node that implements 
	   <xref target="RFC4944"/>. This draft assumes that compatibility information about the
	   remote LoWPAN endpoint is obtained by external means.
	    </t>
		
	    </list>
	    </t>
	</section>
	<section anchor='overview' title="Overview">	
	 
	<t>Considering that a multi-hop LoWPAN can be a very sensitive environment
	due to the limited queueing capabilities of a
	large population of its nodes, this draft recommends a simple and
	conservative approach to congestion control, based on TCP congestion avoidance.
	</t>
	<t>	Congestion on the forward path is assumed in case of packet loss, and packet loss is assumed upon time out.
	</t>
	<t>	Congestion on the forward path can also be indicated by an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) mechanism.
	Though whether and how ECN <xref target="RFC3168"/> is carried out over the LoWPAN is out of scope, 
	this draft provides a way for the destination endpoint to echo an ECN indication
	back to the source endpoint in an acknowledgement message as represented in
	<xref target='ackfig'/> in <xref target='ackfrag'/>.
	</t>
	<t>	From the standpoint of a source LoWPAN endpoint, an outstanding fragment is a fragment that was
	sent but for which no explicit acknowledgement was received yet. 
	This means that the fragment might be on the way, received but not yet acknowledged, 
	or the acknowledgement might be on the way back. It is also possible that either
	the fragment or the acknowledgement was lost on the way.
	</t>
	<t>Because a meshed LoWPAN might deliver frames out of order, it is virtually
	impossible to differentiate these situations. In other words, from the sender standpoint,
	all outstanding fragments might still be in the network and contribute to its congestion.
	There is an assumption, though, that after a certain amount of time, a frame is either received
    or lost, so it is not causing congestion anymore. This amount of time can be estimated based on the round trip
	delay between the LoWPAN endpoints. The method detailed in <xref target="RFC2988"/> is recommended for that computation.
	</t>
	<t>The reader is encouraged to read through <xref target="RFC2914">"Congestion Control Principles"</xref>. 
	Additionally <xref target="RFC2309"/> and <xref target="RFC2581"/> provide deeper information on why this
	mechanism is needed and how TCP handles Congestion Control. Basically, the goal here is to
	manage the amount of fragments present in the network; this is achieved by to reducing the number of outstanding
	fragments over a congested path by throttling the sources.
	</t>
	<t> <xref target="ffc"/> describes how the sender decides how many fragments are (re)sent before
	an acknowledgement is required, and how the sender adapts that number to the network conditions.

    <section anchor="ffc" title="Outstanding Fragments Control">
	
	
	<t>A mechanism based on TCP congestion avoidance dictates the maximum number of outstanding fragments.
	</t>

	<t>
	The maximum number of outstanding fragments for a given packet toward a given LoWPAN
	endpoint is initially set to a configured value, unless recent history indicates
	otherwise. 
	</t>	
	<t> Each time that maximum number of fragments is fully acknowledged, that
	number can be incremented by 1. ECN echo and packet loss cause the number to
	be divided by 2.
	</t>	
	<t> 
	The sender transfers a controlled number of fragments and flags the last
	fragment of a series with an acknowledgement request. 
	</t>	
	<t> 
	The sender arms a timer to cover the fragment that carries the Acknowledgement request. Upon time out,
	the sender assumes that all the fragments on the way are received or lost. It divides the maximum number of 
	outstanding fragments by 2 and resets the number of outstanding fragments to 0. 
	</t>
	<t>Upon receipt of an Acknowledgement request, the receiver responds with an Acknowledgement containing a 
	bitmap that indicates which fragments were actually received. 
	The bitmap is a 32bit DWORD, which accommodates up to 32 fragments and is sufficient for the 6LoWPAN MTU.
	For all n in [0..31], bit n is set to 1 in the bitmap to indicate that fragment with sequence n was received, 
	otherwise the bit is set to 0. 
	</t>
	<t>The receiver MAY issue unsolicited acknowledgements. An unsolicited acknowledgement
	enables the sender endpoint to resume sending if it had reached its maximum number
	of outstanding fragments. Note that acknowledgements might consume precious resources so
	the use of unsolicited acknowledgements should be configurable and not enabled by default.
	</t>
	<t>The received MUST acknowledge a fragment with the acknowledgement request bit set. If any fragment
	immediately preceding an acknowledgement request is still missing, the receiver MAY intentionally 
	delay its acknowledgement to allow in-transit fragments to arrive. This mechanism might defeat the 
	round trip delay computation so it should be configurable and not enabled by default.
	</t>
	<t>Fragments are sent in a round robin fashion: the sender sends all the fragments for a first time
	before it retries any lost fragment; lost fragments are retried in sequence, oldest first. 
	This mechanism enables the receiver to acknowledge fragments that were delayed in the network
	before they are actually retried.
	</t>
	<t>The process must complete within an acceptable time that is within the boundaries of upper layer retries.
	Additional work is required to define how this is achieved. When the source endpoint decides that a packet should be
