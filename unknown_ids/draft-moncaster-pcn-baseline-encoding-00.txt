Internet-Draft            Baseline PCN Encoding                 May 2008


1.  Introduction

   Pre-congestion notification is a mechanism designed to help protect
   the Quality of Service of inelastic flows.  It does this by measuring
   the pre-congestion level on the path used by that flow.  The pre-
   congestion level at each node is indicated by marking packets when
   traffic load is approaching or has exceeded a threshold below the
   physical link rate.  [PCN-arch] describes how PCN marking can be used
   to assure the quality of service of inelastic flows within a single
   DiffServ domain.  This document specifies how those PCN marks are
   encoded into the IP header.  It also describes how packets are
   identified as belonging to a PCN flow.  The baseline encoding
   described here provides for two PCN encoding states.


2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:

   o  Not PCN - packets that are not PCN capable.

   o  PCN-marked - codepoint indicating packets that have been marked at
      a PCN interior node using some PCN marking behaviour.  Also PM.

   o  Not-Marked - codepoint indicating packets that are PCN capable but
      are not PCN-marked.  Also NM.

   o  PCN-Capable codepoints - collective term for all the NM and PM
      codepoints.

   o  PCN enabled Diffserv codepoint - a Diffserv codepoint for which
      PCN has been enabled on a particular machine.

   In addition the document uses the terminology described in
   [PCN-arch].


4.  Encoding Two PCN States in IP

   The PCN encoding states are defined using a combination of the DSCP
   field and ECN field in the IP header.  The baseline PCN encoding

Internet-Draft            Baseline PCN Encoding                 May 2008


   closely follows the semantics of ECN [RFC3168].  It allows the
   encoding of two PCN states: Not Marked and PCN-Marked.  It also
   allows for traffic that is not PCN capable to be marked as such (Not-
   PCN).  The following table defines how to encode these states in IP:

      +--------+--------------+-------------+-------------+---------+
      |  DSCP  | Not-ECT (00) | ECT(0) (10) | ECT(1) (01) | CE (11) |
      +--------+--------------+-------------+-------------+---------+
      | DSCP n |    Not-PCN   |      NM     |      NM     |    PM   |
      +--------+--------------+-------------+-------------+---------+

    Where DSCP n is a PCN-enabled DiffServ codepoint (see Section 4.2)

                        Table 1: Encoding PCN in IP

   The following rules apply to all PCN traffic:

   o  PCN traffic MUST be marked with a DiffServ codepoint that
      indicates PCN is enabled.  To conserve DSCPs, DiffServ Codepoints
      SHOULD be chosen that are already defined for use with admission
      controlled traffic, such as the Voice-Admit codepoint defined in
      [voice-admit].

   o  Any packet that is not PCN capable (Not-PCN) but which shares the
      same DiffServ codepoint as PCN capable traffic MUST have the ECN
      field set to 00.

   o  Any packet that is PCN capable and Not Marked (NM) MUST have the
      ECN field set to one of the two ECT codepoints 10 or 01.

   o  Any packet that is PCN capable and has been PCN-marked by an
      interior node MUST have the ECN field set to 11.

4.1.  Rationale for Encoding

   The exact choice of encoding was dictated by the constraints imposed
   by existing IETF RFCs.  Full details are contained in
   [pcn-enc-compare].  One of the tightest constraints was the need for
   any PCN encoding to survive being tunnelled through either an IP in
   IP tunnel or an IPSec Tunnel.  Appendix A explains this in more
   detail.  The main effect of this constraint was that any PCN marking
   has to use the ECN field set to 11 (CE codepoint).  An additional
   constraint was the need to minimise the use of DiffServ codepoints as
   these are in increasingly short supply.  Section 4.2 explains how we
   have minimised this still further by reusing pre-existing Diffserv
   codepoint(s) such that non-PCN traffic can still be distinguished
   from PCN traffic.

Internet-Draft            Baseline PCN Encoding                 May 2008


   The encoding scheme that best addresses the above constraints ends up
   looking very similar to ECN.  This is perhaps not surprising given
   the similarity in architectural intent between PCN and ECN.

4.2.  PCN-Enabled DiffServ Codepoints

   Equipment complying with the baseline PCN encoding MUST allow PCN to
   be enabled for a certain Diffserv codepoint or codepoints.  This
   document defines the term 'PCN-Enabled Diffserv Codepoint' for such a
   DSCP.  Enabling PCN for a DSCP switches on PCN marking behaviour for
   packets with that DSCP, but only if those packets also have their ECN
   field set to a codepoint other than Not-PCN.

   Enabling PCN marking behaviour disables any other marking behaviour
   (e.g. enabling PCN also disables the default ECN marking behaviour
   introduced in [RFC3168]).  The scheduling behaviour used for a packet
   does not change whether PCN is enabled for a DSCP or not and whatever
   the setting of the ECN field.

4.3.  Valid and Invalid Encoding Transitions at a PCN Node

   PCN edge node behaviour compliant with the PCN baseline encoding:

   o  Any packets with the ECN field already marked as CE or ECT
      arriving at a PCN ingress node SHOULD be dropped or alternatively
      MAY be tunnelled through the PCN region.  They MUST NOT be
      admitted to the PCN region directly.

   o  On leaving the PCN region the ECN bits MUST be set to 00 (Not
      ECT).

   PCN interior node behaviour compliant with the PCN baseline encoding:

   o  PCN Interior nodes MUST NOT change Not-PCN to another codepoint
      and they MUST NOT change a PCN-Capable codepoint to Not-PCN.

   o  PCN interior nodes that are in a pre-congestion state above the
      configured level MUST set the PM codepoint by changing the ECN
      bits to 11.

   o  PM MUST NOT be changed to NM.


5.  Backwards Compatability

   BCP 124 [RFC4774] gives guidelines for specifying alternative
   semantics for the ECN field.  It sets out a number of factors that
   must be taken into consideration.  It also suggests various



Moncaster, et al.       Expires November 16, 2008               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            Baseline PCN Encoding                 May 2008


   techniques to allow the co-existence of default ECN and alternative
   ECN semantics.  The alternative semantics specified here are
   compliant with this BCP:

   o  they use a DSCP to allow routers to distinguish that traffic uses
      the alternate ECN semantics;

   o  these semantics are defined for use within a controlled domain;

   o  ECN marked traffic is blocked from entering the PCN domain
      directly (though it might be tunnelled through the domain).


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request to IANA.  It does however suggest a
   change to the default ([RFC3168]) behaviour for the ECN field for the
   Voice-Admit [voice-admit] DSCP.


7.  Security Considerations

   Packets claim entitlement to be PCN marked by carrying a PCN-enabled
   DSCP and a PCN-Capable ECN codepoint.  This encoding document is
   intended to stand independently of the architecture used to determine
   whether specific packets are authorised to be PCN marked, which will
   be described in a future separate document on PCN edge-node
   behaviour.  The PCN working group has initially been chartered to
   only consider a PCN region to be entirely under the control of one
   operator, or a set of operators who trust each other [PCN-charter].
   However there is a requirement to keep inter-domain scenarios in mind
   when defining the PCN encoding.  One way to extend to multiple
   domains would be to concatenate PCN regions and use PCN edge-nodes
   back-to back at borders.  Then any one domain's security against its
   neighbours would be described as part of the edge-node behaviour
   document as above.  There is only one proposal on the table to extend
   PCN across multiple domains without PCN edge nodes back-to-back at
   borders [re-PCN]. it is believed that the encoding described here
   would not be incompatible with the security framework described
   there.


8.  Conclusions

   This document defines the baseline PCN encoding utilising a
   combination of a PCN-enabled DSCP and the ECN field in the IP header.
   This baseline encoding allows the existence of two PCN encoding
   states, Not Marked and PCN-Marked.  It also allows for the co-

   existence of non-PCN traffic within the same DSCP.  The encoding
   scheme is conformant with [RFC4774].

Appendix A.  Tunnelling Constraints

   The rules that govern the behaviour of the ECN field for IP-in-IP
   tunnels were defined in [RFC3168].  This allowed for two tunnel modes
   to exist.  The limited functionality mode sets the outer header to
   Not ECT, regardless of the value of the inner header.  The full
   functionality mode copies the inner ECN field into the outer header
   if the inner header is Not ECT or either of the 2 ECT codepoints.  If
   the inner header is CE then the outer header is set to ECT(0).  On
   decapsulation, if the CE codepoint is set on the outer header then
   this is copied into the inner header.  Otherwise the inner header is
   left unchanged.  The reason for blocking CE from being copied to the
   outer header was to prevent this from being used as a covert channel
   through IPSec tunnels.

   The IPSec protocol [RFC4301] changed the ECN tunnelling rule to allow
   IPSec tunnels to simply copy the inner header into the outer header.
   This was because the security community had decided the available
   bandwidth of the covert channel offered by ECN was too low to be a
   significant threat.  On decapsulation the outer header is discarded
   and the ECN field is only copied down if it is set to CE.  Because of
   the possible existence of tunnels, only CE (11) can be used as a PCN
   marking as it is the only mark that will survive decapsulation.

   There is a further issue involving tunnelling.  In RFC3168, IP in IP
   tunnels are expected to set the ECN field to ECT(0) if the inner ECN
   field is set to CE.  This leads to the possibility that some packets
   within the PCN field that have already been marked may have that mark
   concealed further into the region.  This is undesirable for many PCN
   schemes and thus standard IP in IP tunnels SHOULD NOT be used within
